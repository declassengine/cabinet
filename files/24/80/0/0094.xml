(Circulated at the -re&quot;qae&quot;sFTF!ThT President of theBoard o.f Education. ) ,In view of opportunities for reconstruction which the tormina-tion of the War will afford, it is desirable to promote reforms which will improve the conditions under which the Licensed Trade is carried on, and to provide a better service to the Public, thereby making ng for t empe r anc e..Such reforms must recognise amongst others the following-principles : -1.     That measures which curtail freedom do not necessarily promote sobriety.2.     That the function of the State is to maintain public crdei and to punish drunkenness, but not to decide, except-as to the purity of the article supplied, what a man shall eat and drink.3*     That existing licensing machinery should be so modified as to provide a system which shall ensure uniformity of administration, and that such modification should be in the direction of setting up judicial tribunals operating over wide areas on uniform principles, witl an appeal from their decisions to a single central judicial authority.4.     That, where the number of licenses is excessive, re-duction should bo brought about with due regard to all interests affected, accompanied by facilities for the improvement of those licensed premises which remain, and for the removal of licences to developing districts.
That Improvements which involve an enlargement of premises and provide opportunities for greater social amenities fire more in the interests of temperance than s rigid adherence to existing restrictions on licensed premises.une. 1919.
