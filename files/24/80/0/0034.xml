r(&amp;llS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEPJTOTSECRET. 10G.T. 7333/% WAR CABINET.PORT AND TRANSIT EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. THE COASTING TRADE OP THE UNITED KINGDOM, (Further Memorandum by Six Norman Hill.)(1) I would ask to be allowed to refer to the memorandum sub-mitted on behalf of this Committee on the f 2nd January 1919.(2) As was anticipated in January 1919, the Railway Companies are now no longer able to deal with the oversea imports&apos; at the rate at which they are arriving, and the necessity for re-establishing the coasting Services in a full state of efficiency has become a pressing and urgent necessity.(3) As the Country gets back to Industry and Commerce, the Railway wagons are being held, on the average, longer under-load, and in consequence their available carrying power has decreased.The difficulties are increased by the Railway Companies being called upon to carry an immense amount of traffic which, under pre-war conditions, was dealt with by the Coasting Services.There appears to be no prospect of the supply of Railway wagons being substantially increased for some considerable time.(4) Apart from the difficulties resulting fror the in? debate., supply of Railway wagons, the big ports are blocked t&apos;..rci*ur being deprived of the facilities thej pobrcFsed before the war for making overside deliveries and distributing by the. Coaeting Services a substantial part of the imports.The congestion in the big ports is delaying the turn round r.f the ocean-go in,-:, trips., anc. thcieby lessening the volume of imports that are being bi&quot;ought into this country.(5) The receiving and distributing facilities offered by the smaller ports, which were served by the Coasting Services, are not being used to the best advantage.(6) If the coasting Services are to be re-established, they must be ensured regular employment.&apos; Nothing effective can be done so long as the owners of the cargo are offered every inducement to hold back those cargoes on the chance of the Rail-ways being able to carry them at pre-war rates.(?) prom every point of view, the position is, in the opinion rf the Port and Transit Executive committee a deplorable one(1) The carrying power of the ocean-going ships is being wasted.(2) Dabour in the big ports is being discouraged by constant delays in waiting for Railway wagons.(3) The distributing facilities and the Labour in the smaller ports are being wasted.(4) The Railways are being congested with unnecessary traffic./  Annexed.
(5) The distribution of the imports of food and raw material amongst the consumers is being hampered and delayed.(8) The courses open are those indicated in the memorandum the 2nd January 1919.They are as follows(a) To issue the proposed order enabling Railway Companies to refuse to accept goods for carriage by rail where other means of transport exist, subject to such con-ditions as may be described by the order.(b) To raise the Railway rates generally, or in any event between points that can be served by both the Railways and Coasting services, so that such rates may at least cover the actual cost of rail carriage.(c) To abandon the idea of freeing imports and to keep the Imports at the big ports strictly within the dis-tributing capacity of the Railways from those ports.
2nd January, .1919.THE COASTING TRADE OF TO UNITED. KINGDOM MEMORANDUM 31 6IR NORMAN HILL.1. On the 27th April 1918 power wa3 given to the Board ofTrade under the Defence of the Realm Regulation 7 B (1) K to issue an Order &quot;for enabling Railway Conmnies to refuse to accept goods for carriage by rail whero other means of transport exist, subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by the Order&quot;.This Order has been drafted, but not issued.2. The Port Authorities in the great ports Ti%$fch deal withnearly 90$ of the total imports of the United Kingdom are unanimous that the facilities for distribution by the Coasting Services as they now exist, must be Improved before they will be able to deal with anything- approaching the volume of Imports that passed through those ports under peace conditions.These ports must have the advantage of both land and sea distribution to enable them to give the ocean going ships the quickest possible turn-round.Under peace conditions the Railways and Coasting Services were in competition.The running expenses in.both Services have increased enormously, in wages, coal, stores and upkeep.Until the Armistice, the Coasting Services were further handicapped by War Risk Insurance on both the ships and their cargoes.In the case of the Railways the increase in the operating cost  alls almost entirely on the State, as peace hates have been practically maintained at the cost of the Tax Payers.In the ca3fe of the Coasting Services this increase in the operating cost has to be covered by the freights, and these have been substantially advanced.It follows that the Coasting Services are no longer able to complete commercially, for the traffic, and that the Importers use their utmost endeavours to get all their cargoes sent forward by rail to their ultimate destination.During the war these factors resulted in:-(1)   Detention of the ocean going steamships In the ports and consequent loss of carrying power.(2)   Congestion on the Quays.(3)   Congestion on the Railways.
The work of the Home&apos; Trade&quot; Txan^ and of the Local Committees it has established in the principal ports, has met with considerable success, in getting traffic transferred back to the Coasting Services and on to Canals.   The last figures available are as underTraffic diverted from rail to water transitJuly      1918 . ..........ft%... 76,959 tonsAusust      &quot; ................ 92,557   &quot;September 11 ................     65,378   &quot;October.    &quot; ................ 113,08l   &quot;But the work of the Committee has been handicapped by reason of the absence of any authority to enforce its instructions.So long as the War lasted the Importers were ready to respond to appeals to relieve the railways of traffic that could be carried coastwise, and moreover the Importers were not fully alive to the fact that the Board of Trade had not exercised its powers, and that therefore the Railways were not in a position to refuse the traffic.Now that the stimulus of winning the war has ceased to, be operative, the Importers are challenging the right of the Committee to divert traffic to the Coasting Services at freights considerably in excess of the Railway Rates.Additional tonnage is becoming available for the Coasting Services but there is no chance of even the tonnage now available being offered at freights fixed in competition with the Railway Rates - that is so long as the Railway rates remain on practically a peace basis.     Other employment as for example the French Coal&quot; Trade, is open to the Coast-ing vessels at remunerative rates.The necessity for maintaining and increasing coastwise distribution from the big ports is urgent.     Under peace conditions we were bringing in imports at the rate of about 58,000,000 tons weight per annum, of which about 12,000,000 tons came from Central Europe on the smaller types of vessel which could make use of the smaller ports, and about 46,000,000 tons came in on ocean voyages in the larger types of vessel which could only be handled&quot;in the big ports.Last year (1918) we brought in about 35,000,000 tons weight of Imports, of which about 33,000,000 tons will have come on ocean voyages in the larger types of vessel into the big ports.The exporting power of Central Europe must remain very limited, and therefore any substantial increase in our imports must be brought in on ocean voyages into the big port3.As has been stated the Port Authorities in the big port are unanimous that facilities for distribution by the Coasting Services must be improved before they will be able to pass through their ports the volume of traffic they dealt with under peace conditions.
At the moment the Railways (having been freed from a , great deal of Munition traffic and having not yet to deal with the traffic incident to General Demobilisation) are freer.     Probably tjiey could handle at the moment, the imports at the rate at which they are now arriving, but neither the big ports nor the railways serving those ports will, without the help of the Coasting Services, be able to handle the increased volume of traffic we must have to get the Nation back to Industry and Commerce.. 4Unless the Coastal Services are in a position to compete with the Railways there is grave risk that these services, so essential for purposes of distribution around the coasts of the United Kingdom,  will no longer be able to perform their part.It is essential that a ruling may be given on this matter at an early date before the Coastal Services, at present available, are dissipated.The courses open v*ould appear to- be:-a. To issue the Order notwithstanding the Armistice, and thereby to force cargo on to the Coasting Services to the relief of the Railways, orb. To raise the Railway Rate3 generally, or in any event between points that can be served by both the Railways and the Coasting Services, so that such rates may at least cover the actual cost of Rail carriage, orc. Keep the imports within the distributing capacity of the Railways, and recognise that distribution coastwise must be abandoned.
