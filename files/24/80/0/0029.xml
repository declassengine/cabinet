HOIjO; of commons,&apos; onMONDAY, MAY 19 th, 1919, at 6 p,in,, on -(1) THE AVOKMOUTH SPELTER WORKS:(2) THE PURCHASE OF LEAD AND COPPER FROM AUSTRALIA:PRESENT:Mr. Bonar Law, (in the Chair)Mr. chamoe r1a i n.Sir Auckland Geddes.Dr. Addison.Lord Inverforth.Colonel L-S, Amery.Mr. Thomas Jones, Acting Secretary, War Cabinet.Mr. Pembroke Wicks, Assistant Secretary, War Cabinet.
(1)     THE AVOMMOUTH SPELTER WORKS *The Conference had before them a letter&quot; fToro..sir-^eklar^d Oeddes to Mr. Chamberlain, dated Kay 13, 1919, covering a ItownmduBi. by Mr. Ronca of the Board of Trade, on the present position of the Avonmouth Spelter Works and future policy with regard thereto (Appendix &quot;A&quot;), which was considered in its rel&amp;iioh to a Memorandum by the Board of Trade of April 1?, 1919 (Paper G.T.7113) on the Spelter Industry in the United Kingdom, and the War Cabinet decision! thereon of April 17, 1919 (War Cabinet 558, Minute 5), by which it had been decided that the arrangement made by the Ministry of Munitions to take over the whole output of British spelter makers at  56 per ton, plus the increased cost of labour and fuel since the date of the agreement, should he continued for a further six months.it was stated in the Memorandum that Mr. Tilden Smith had annoimced on April 28 that he intended to close down the Avonmouth Works forthwith, owing to His Majesty&apos;s Government having refused a further loan of   00,000, hut that he might agree to go on if &apos; he could secure zinc concentrates at a fixed price, and have in addition a guaranteed price for Spelter.     It was further stated that in order to ensure the continuance of the Avonmouth scheme, it was necessary to announce a policy for some considerable time ahead, and that before settling the details of any scheme, it was essential to know (a) whether the general principle of extending the subsidy to spelter manufacturers in some form for a substantial period was approved;     (h)   the financial limit per ton of spelter to which His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to go i/i order to extend and maintain the industry;     (c) the maximum tonnage of spelter production per annum to which the soheme should apply. It appeared also from the Memorandum that the amount of profit likely to he obtained from the by-products of the smelting process did not amount to a figure of any significance.
SIR AUCKLAND G3ED3S said that it was a choice between spending a large amount of money and allowing the business to go to pieces.     He had only recommended the interim arrango-ment because he hope&apos; that by the time it expired it would be possible to settle on a permanent policy.   It -as shown in the Memorandum that Mr Tilden Smith had been compelled to put up his wages by 2d. an hour, had not been able to conclude a contract with His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure Australian concentrates, and had boon refused a loan of  500,000, and therefore proposed to close the forks,MR.CH^iBlRMIIJ said that it had been impressed upon hj$n in the strongest possible terms that further expenditure on these different enterprises &apos;ould be very unpopular.   He ^as considering the proosal of a further loan to meet expenditure and fund the floating debt,   From every source he received the assurance thot unless he could say he was borrowing only in order to fund and therefore not for new expenditure; the pros-pects of obtaining money were extremely bad.   People --.1th money would not lend for new expenditure.SIR AUCKLAND G3DEES agreed \hat it was an appalling state of affairs. This proposition by itself ^as bad enough, but it was only an item in a long series of similar matters,LORD IMVEEF0B-2H said that there -as another bad. case, . the Appleby Iron Ore Company.1 s whs in Lincolnshireerected at the request of the Admiralty.   The firm  ;as asking for payment on account of  2,900,000.   The  zeros would net&quot;be finished until, 1920.
SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES said that the finanftial arrangement with the Avonr-outh Co. was based on an agreement with the Ministry of Munitions at the time that Dr. Addison was Minister. At the back of everything was the intention that the Govern-ment were going to see Mr. Tilden Smith through.     The provisional estimate of cost had been  710,000, the Government guarantee not exceeding  ,500,000.   SIR AUCKLAND GEBDES than read an abstract of the terms agreed upon.   (Appendix nB&quot;.)DR. ADDISON said that the arrangement was that Mr. Tilden Smith should be supplied with a certain tonnage of Australian concentrates, and an advance was made for the purpose of build-in^ works, to have an output of 100,000 tons.   He remembered rais-ing the point with Sir John Mann of the necessity for defining our liability.     It would be a disaster if we could not go on. The Avonmouth factory would be the best equipped works in the country.MR. CHUMBERLAIN said that made it all the more amazing that the undertaking could not be made to pay.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES said he did not think the Government would be breaking a bargain if it refused further assistance, but Mr. Tilden Smith would stop too.     If we refused to go on we still had the South Wales Smelting Works, but we had 600,000 tons of concentrates on our hands with limited selling rights.LORD INVERFORTH &quot;said&quot; that-carrier Tilden Smith alleged that the cost of materials and labour had increased by another - ,500,000. fuel was the biggest item, b% tons of coal being required for every ton of spelter produced.SIR AUCKLAND C-EDDES said that coal wat &apos;,he nvain trouble.
\;z should have to shut off tho export of coal entirely 96in July If wo wore to moot tho demands of existing industries in this country.LORD IHVhEiWl1H said that tho development of oil fuel offered some prospect of relief,    There was surplus of tank tonnage available.Mr. BOJSAR Ufr was of opinion that fcfr, Tilden Smiths re-quest for further assistance involved tlw Government in too groat a liability.     The previous decision of tho O&amp;Mttet was for temporary assistance only.    The present proposal involved ns in an expenditure of a large capital sum plus tho annual subsidy.oIR /iUCJGuA&amp;D GBDDEjj said that zinc smelting aae a real key industry, and ho thought it would be wise to try and prevent a complete stoppage until we saw trhat the House of Commons would do for the protection of key industries, and then 1st it sink or swim under whatover protection was grant-ed to the industries of tho count r/.     The country must wake up to the fact that they had cither to work or starve; there was no other way out.    He recommended that no capital sum should be givon, but a guaranteed price for the Shortest period possible.Dr. ADDIBOU was exceedingly surprised at the figures of cost,LOUD IHVKRtfOBTH said that the price of spelter had risen from  23 per ton before the   ar to  49 and even higher at certain periods.    Tho American price for sale in this country was  38 at present.bIE JJGKXtdfD GEDDtto said there was no basis for the operation of a Dumping Bill in this case, because the Americans had reduced their price aa a whole.     They had big? surplus stocks, and  vory rich beds of ore compared with -our sources of bupply,* \- 5 -
It was hoped that the total national..production at spelter in this country would come to 180,000 tons,   before the V,ar the total tonnage produced in this country had been 35,000   tons.He had not yet tried to come to an agreement with Mr, Tilden iimith, &quot;because he did. not know how far the Government were prepared to go.Mil. CHAMSEKIiAIN said that in any event there would bo groat difficulty in securing the protection of toey industries5 even more in some respects than in securing a tariff all round.   On the other hand, it was impossible to live on bounties, but we could live in spite of l:roteotion0MR. BOIUB La7 agreed, but said that bir Auckland Ge&amp;des1 point was that until the Government knew what policy they were going to adept they ought tot to turn down the Avonmouth scheme.SIR AUCKLAND GlDJEci said it was important to remember that the mental atmosphere of business men had entirely charged since the Armistice.     They were all back at their businesses, and refused to treat with the Government&apos; in the spirit which had prevailed during the -Tar,If Mr. Tilden Smith refused to go on the Government could take possession.     Mr. Tilden Smith had only paid in  85,000; that was l/- a share cn 500,000 shares, and there was no power to compel the Company to call up the unpaid capital,LORD ijs!V3jiR?QEIH said that he understood the arrangement to have been that if the Government put up  500,000 Mr, Tilden, Smith would put up his  500,000, but it was not in the agreement. There was no uncalled capital as security.     The original intention was that the factory should be built on joint account, but it had not been carried out in the agreement, or doubtless Mr. Tilden Smith would have performed his share.DR. addison stated that he was at the Ministry of Munitions at the time the agreement was signed.   The contract was negcti-ated by Ministry of Munitions officials, viz., oir John Mann and Company, together with a representative of the Board of- 6 - Trade,
Trade, on behalf of the Government.SIB AUCELAHD GBBDEu said that probably, after this dis-cussion, it would be best for hi:, to see Mr. Tilden janith, Lord Inverforth beiii^ present.iffi, CHAUBEELalW suggested that it would be necessary to ascertain exactly the rights of the Government under the agreementa He doubted whether there was power to foreclose.   3ir Auckland Geddeu had stated that the Government could enter on the works inthe public interest, but this did not necessarily irmly a right-of foreclosure in the event of &apos;...r. 11 Id en omith throwing up the work) and had probably been intended to meet the war emergency in the case of tho work not being properly carried out while the War was going en.MR. 30HAR Wfl thought that prims facie Mr, Ohamberiaiin^sdoubt was a reasonable one.     The agreement really contemplatedour going in in order to carry on the work, and not for the pur-poses of foreclosure.     Our immediate difficulty would be the cryof unemployment which would be raised if the works were closed do:.vn3aMI-., OEuMBEELAlW said that it would be/different thing for the Government themselves to follow up the  500,000 they had already invested and take over the works and carry them on, &quot;but he would not give Mr, Tilden omith the terms he was asking.    Traders on all hands were refusing to do things without a Government guarantee, It was impossible to go on on that basis.MR. BOMB i^I suggested that if ..r. Tilden wraith could not make it pay the Government could not.LOHB IIVMMTH sal. d he could not believe there was a difference of ZZd between the pre-war cost and the present cost.

(2) PURCHASE 0? IMS AND COPPER FHOM AUSTRALIA.The Conference had under consideration a Memorandum by Sir Auckland Geddes (paper G.T. 7261) containing the draft heads of an agreement proposed by the Ministry of Munitions and the Board of Trade, together with a Memorandum by lord Milner (paper G.T. 7259) supporting the proposed agreement on the ground of Imperial policy.LEAD.LORD IFVERFORTH said that the only alteration he proposed was in paragraph 4 of the Heads of Agreement, - to substitute &quot; 21&quot; for &quot; 25&quot; as the price to which soft pig lead in London must rise before His Majesty&apos;s Government were entitled to plaoe on the market the stocks of pig lead in their possession or under their control.MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that he had certain general observa-tions to make, (l) An agreement of this kind was covered by the War obligations Acts.   The last of these obligations had been tabled, and any new agreements would have to be brought before parliament.   The guarantees given by the Government during the War were all covered by the War Obligations Acts. There was now no power to give such guarantees, and if the pro-posals were to be proceeded with a Bill would have to be intro-duced.   (2) A Cabinet Committee had sat, under his Chairmanship, at the end of 1918, and had issued a Report (paper G.T. 6206) in which it was stated that there would be a world shortage af lead, but not of copper.   They had therefore recommended an agreement Sn the case of lead on the merits but in the case of copper on political grounds only.   Lord Inverforth had been opposed to an agreement in both cases on the merits but had concurred on political grounds.   That agreement was now out of date.   Three periods had been contemplated, but in view of the Armistice the only period comparable with the present proposals was the third.   The Committee had recommended in the third- 9 &quot;* period
period in the case of lead that up to December 31, 1929, the British Government ahould undertake to purchase the entire 8urpluor Australian production of lead after providing for Australian consumption and Australian geographical markets, at the price realised on the London market, less 1%, with a guaranteed minimum of  17. 10. 0 f.o.b. Port pirie, and  17. 16, o f.o.b. Sydney, profits between the prices realised and the guaranteed &quot;minimum being shared between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the   Australian producers; if the proposal for sharing profits was not accepted, then the minimum to be only  15   or  16.   As the present proposals did not allow of His Majesty&apos;s Government receiving half the profits unless the price rose to  23, and then only to the extent of sums paid by His Majesty&apos;s Government in respect of the guarantee, the terms proposed by the Committee were more favourable to the British Government than those now put forward.   The Committee^ proposals had been offered to Mr. Hughes during the V/ar and he had not accepted them.   The Committee had been working on the hypothesis that there would be a world shortage of lead, and there was now, temporarily at any rate, a glut of lead; con-sequently there was no inducement to the British Government, from a commercial point of view,  to make any agreement at all,In the case of copper the Committee had proposed to guarantee a price to the Australians of  70 per ton for the first five years, with a right for either side to demand a revision of the price at the end of that period, subject to arbitration, and had said that in any case the figure of  80 seemed too high for a minimum if fixed for a period of 10 years, as they proposed.   They had also recommended that at least one-half of the quantity to be shipped should be in the form of blister copper, the refining industry in this country - which it was important to maintain - having been gravely prejudiced by the embargo placed on the export of bar copper by the Commonwealth Government since the outbreak of the War.
They further recommended that in the case of copper also the British Government should share in any profits secured from the sales above the minimum guaranteed price;     The present proposals, In the case of copper, were for His ivlajosty&apos;s Government to buy up to .35.,000 tons at a minimum agreed price of  80 per ton f.o.b, Sydney, the profits above that price being shared with the Australians.     It was therefore clear that the present proposals were much more advantageous to the Australians than those recommended by the Committee,.COLONEL A;:.I3RY pointed out that it was understood that in consideration of this purchase tho Australians would make no further call on this Government in regard to the &quot;future production of copper in Australia.LORD DIVWOETH said that the Australians had been able to make out a case that during the war they had supplied lead at low prices compared with those prevailing in the rest of the world., but In the case of copper they had not been able to make out any case at all.     The present price of copper was  83, and the Govern-ment had about 80,000 tons In stock which they,had bought during the war at a much higher price, on which there would be a heavy loss.     He did not think copper would go much below  80.     The pre-war price had been  60.SIR AUCKLAND GT3DD3IS said that he did not think there would be any commercial loss on the transaction, and the Board of Trade were prepared to support the proposals on account of the Colonial Office point of view that it was necessary to satisfy the Australians on political grounds.COLONEL AMHRY said that the Australians had not made big profits out of the sales of copper to this country.     They had been exploiting m!nes which they had made special efforts to work in order to provide copper for us and relieve us to some extent from relying on America.     Having done this, they felt that it -would be very hard to shut thorn down now.
certain ofLORD IHVL^FORTH pointed out that/tho mines nere bound to go, they wore too expensive to work and could only produce copper at  100 per ton, so that at the present prices they were working at a loss,COLONEL said that the Colonial Office were anxiousto let the Australians down as gently as possible, owing to labour and other difficulties with ihich they were confrontedoMR. BONAR LAW said that it had been suggested to mm Hughes that the Australians should share the losses, if any, as well as the profits, which appeared to be a reasonable proposition, but he would not agree;.    He suggested that the price should be fixed at  80 and the Australians asked to -halve the loss., if any,-,COLON72L AMSRY thought that that vrould meet our obligations.MR. BONAR LAW said that Mr.&apos; Hughes&apos; case was that we made a big profit out of wool, which he could easily have sold in America at much higher prices than we paid him.LORD TNV3RP0RTH said that that was not so;   the Australians could not get the shipsnMR, CHAMBERLAIN pointed out that the Committee on Australian Purchases had said that  80 was too high as a minimum price, and had recommended  70 for the first five years.SIR AUCKLAND GH)DES observed that the present proposal was for one year only.LORD INVERF0RTH said that if the price for releasinggraduallythe stocks of Government pig lead was reduced/to  21 he did not think there would be any loss in the case of either lead or copper.     The Government were at present selling copper on a steady market at  83cCOLONEL kVmY pointed out that if copper fell to  76 the loss to the Government would be  100,000.LORD IirraFORTH said that he did not think the prices would go as low as that, and suggested that the copper arrange-ment was a. reasonable proposition^
Some disoussion took place as to whether the Australian Government were bound to sell the total quantity.MR. BONAR LAV: said that it must be made clear in the agreement that we were to buy 25,000 tons firm, and not up to 25,000 tons, as stated in the Heads of Agreement.MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that if re bought at a price within  2 of the present American price we ought to buy f&amp;rm and keep the profits, if r.ny.LORD I1TORF0RTH said that we had in sfcock or in sight 75,000 tons of copper, half of our yearly consumption,   -here was, therefore, not much chance of the price going up perman-ently.MR, CHAMBERLAIN said that he would like to give,. 75 per ton, with an equal share of the profit and loss,LORD INVERPORTH said the period was too short for- fcfcis-price.1IR. BONAR LAW suggested that paragraph 3      the Heads of Agreement relating, to copper, which provided that profits on sales above the minimum price should be shared, should be omitted if possible.   The Australians might be ready to accept an out,-and out sale of 25,000 tons.Some further discussion took place in regard to the terms of the lead proposals.MR. BONAR LA&apos;, thought the terms proposed would be a bad bargain and that we ought to share the profits.i!R. CHAMBERLAIN thought it would be fairer to treat the whole bargain as one, and to take over the vhole amount of lead at  18 firm, to be an average over the whole quantity.   If all were sold at  18 per ton nothing was to happen.   If sold below, we would pay the loss.   If sold above  18 we would take half the profits.MP. BONAR LA&apos;;; agreed.LORD IFVilHFORTH said that we practically had a year&apos;s supply of, lead in stock.
SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES said that it would be made plain in the agreement, that the Australians were bound to give us the full amount in equal monthly quantities.MR. BONAR LAY; agreed.MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that a Bill in Parliament would be necessary.The Conference decided:-(a) To accept the proposals in regard to copper, subject to it being made plain that the Australians --ere bound to sell the &quot;/hole 25,000 tons to the British Government in eqlml monthly quantities,(b) To accept the proposals in regard tc lead. provided that the whole quantity be sold to the British Government in equal monthly quantities at a guaranteed price of ;Zltt per ton, that any profits secured by sales above that figure be shared, and losses below  16 be borne by H.M. Government.2, Whitehall Gardens, May 20th, 1919.
appendix;-aboard ob1 trade,wiitphall gardfns ,S * V 9 1&quot;13th May, 1919,Dear Chamberlain,I send you a copy of a Memorandum on the position of the Avonmouth Spelter Works, which raises the question of the policy to be adopted with regard to the zinc smelting industry.    The supple-montary note dated the 9th May was prepared in order to clear up a point which was not dealt with In the earlier Memorandum, viz., the amount of profit likely to be obtained from the bye-products of the smelting process.    The note shows, I think, that any profit from bye-products cannot be taken as a figure of any significance.As you will remember., the War Cabinet have already agreed to give some assistance to the Spe ter Industry, and it was decided by them, on the 17th April that the present arrangement? made by the Ministry of Munitions should be continued for a further period of six months.     I hope very much that you will agree to the proposals contained in the Hemorandum now enclosed.X should point out that HV&quot;:.Government have contracted to buy practically the whole exportable surplus of Australian zinc con-centrates for a term of two years, and that owing to the absence of shipping facilities very large quantities bought under the contract have accumulated in Australia.     It is very necessary that selling should commence forthwith - but this is not possible until the future of the zinc smelting industry in this country Is settled: a suitable.selling policy can then be adopted, both for hone and foreign sales.   It would of course be possible to subsidise the Fine Smelters here by selling the concentrates to them at a price below thr Government purchase price:   the difference would, however, have to be large, and the Government loss heavyo     I think what it is very desirable that the two transactions should be kept distinct: i..e., the sale of the concentrates should, be handled as a commercial transaction (though without seeking, a profit), and the subsidy to the Zinc Smelters should be direct and distinct.    The proposals in the Memorandum have been framed with that object.It is really essential that the Spelter Industry should be kept alive in this country, and this I know is the personal view of the Prime Minister, which I remember his expressing at a Meeting of the Cabinet.ftYours sincerely,(Sgdc)       A,C.geddes.
jffiMORANDUM ON THg PRTOKT POSITION OF THff A&quot; ONMQUTH SPELTER r&quot;ORKS AND &quot;UTTJRE POLICY WITH REGARD THERETO.J..    Mr. Tilden Smith telephoned to mo on April 28th and told me that because(a) He had just been compelled to put his wages up by 2d. per hour;(b) He has been refused the further loon of  500,000 for which he a3rod;(c) He has not been able to conclude a contract with His   &apos;;ajestyTs -Government to secure Australian concentratesit is his intention to close down the ^vonmouth v--orks on Saturday next. In his letter of April 29th he confirms this conversation,II I asked htm whether, notwithstanding the refusal regarding the loan, he would go on if he could secure concentrates at a fixed price and have, moreover, a guaranteed price for Spelter. He replied that, subject to his agreeing prices, he would go on.     rrhen I asked this I did so. on the assumption (d) that  -he would be able to start smelting in, say, two or three months&apos; time, (a) that we might be able to arrange for a supply of concentrates to start him in, say, three months1 time, and (f) that he could operate remuneratively under the conditions governing other smelters until November 5th (see I.M. 2358).     I intended to test those assumptions and if the results proved favourable to send for  lr. Smith and discuss the matter with him in order to outline definite proposals.III *7ith. regard to (f) the oroblom resolves itself as follows:-Assuming 2^/5 tons of oro par ton of Spelter the cost per ton of Spelter works out at  49.17,8.i l A s   t (I O      -Total Pre-war costs -perton of ore treated...   4, 11, 11.

As against these Increments In oost during the war (including tho recent riot of 9a.8ia) the Government allows a rebate of some  6,6.0. to the smelter.   Thus In so far as the smelter is concerned the net oosts per ton of spelter amount to  43.11.8,In addition to this direct rebate the Government gu;:rontee the smelter a price of  56 per ton of shelter on the basis of the 8&quot;*li*r having to pay  11.4.6. per ton for 47;! ore.3hould however the price paid by the smelter for 47$ ore rise or fall below  11.4,6. the guarantee   prioe  56 is in effect increased or diminished by a corresponding- adjustment amount.This adjustment in the ev -nt of ore being seoured by the smelter at  8 per ton amounts to  8.12.0.per ton of Bpelter, and thus with ore at :i8.per ton the prioe in eflact for spelter guaranteed by H.M.G. is  47.8.0. instead of  56 per ton.     ith net production costs to the smelter at  43.11.8* and ability to sell at  47.8.0. it -*ould ap &apos;ear thot Avonmonth,  -&apos;ere it operating, could clear  3.16,4.per ton of spelter.     The differ-enoo between the guarantee&quot; ^rice and the market price added to the rebate in respect of increased smelting costs gives the net subsidy paid by H.M.G. per ton of spelter.The following table shots tho bonus paid per ton of spelter at different rrioes per ton of oonoeltrctes end. at different nr.rhot prices for spelter undei the nar cost conditions discussod.The result on these bo ins figures -reduced by a  iven fall in the ^rice of coal may be apreci ted by remembering th t the production of 1 ton of. spelter involves n. consumption of 5 3/3 tons of coal.Bonus involved per ton of spelter T/ith concentrates atferkot Price  8.per ton.  7 per ton         i3.10.0.per ton.of Spelter. 30	 23.14.0,	&apos;  21.0,3.	 19.14,0. 35	 18.14.0.	 16.0,8.	 14.14,0. 38	 15.14.0.	 13.0,8.	 11.14.0. 40.	 13,14.0.	 11.0.0.	 9.14,0. 45.	 8,14.0.	 6.0.8.	 4.14,0.
IVt  Vflth regard to (t) I have ascertained that we could not erpeot to deliver ore to AvonjQQOuth in less than five months, and regarding (d) it is Improbable that the works will bo ready to operate before iieptember.Y.   The decision to continue the welters1 subsidy(minutes of morning meeting, 15th April/19) doee net accordantly present any inducement to continue the Avonmoufch works - The conditions are not firm for a peripds&amp;ffiolently longeVI*   If iUM.GL intends to ensure the extensions of the domestiergine oaelting Industry, it is essential that the new works should be developed.    The only new plaxst worth counting is that of ^.70runouth and work $here will be suspended unless Mr, Tilden hmith is gi^en an assurance that Governmental as0*fi$a^ge of some kind will be famished for an extended period.    Such assistance, if given, will constitute the price to be paid for securing this important industry to this country.    (Also it must be remembered that H.M.G. already has soaks &amp;$O.Q0O in the concern, has alls wed substantial writing down and, further, it is necessary that firm contracts should be secured for the disposal of 2ino Concentrates.)VII.   Xt is certain that if Zinc Smelting is to becarried on at all in this country the subsidy in 95.me form must be oentinued for all works beyond November 5th/l9 and until the world position has become stabilised,!Po existing works in operation it is of com-parativaly small importance that they should know their fate for only six months ahead,    !i!he owners of such works argue;    irk1e may as well continue for an-other six months; if at the end of that time nothing is done we may hare to shut up*    On the other hand something may be done or conditions may change.nk man putting up or completing a new works, however, is in a totally different position and he cannot reasonably be expeoted to continue unless he sees the future generally assured.TIIX.   H ensure t$M, continuance of the j.vonmouth sckeme it is necessary, I am convinced, at least to announce a pelioy for some considerable time ahead.    I think we ahould, if it ie intended to build up the industry here, stake it known that the subsidy scheme will in some form (possibly a modified one) bf* continued.II.&apos; Before settling the details of any scheme, however, it is essential to know (in order that our advisers may be aware of the limitation under w&amp;ich they are
to work:-that the general principle (of extending the scheme in some fcrm for a substantial period) is approved;the financial limit per ton of spelter to which H.M.G. is prepared to go in order to extend and maintain the industryjthe limiting tonnage of spelter pro-duct ion per annum to which the scheme shall apply.At the present time tf ore were available at  8 per ton the existing scheme, when the price of spelter is  38. involves the Government in a subsidy of  15. 14. C per ton of spelter.     (This gives a profit of  3. 16. 5 per ton of spelter) -If this were taken as a basis, - (some other sum could be tauen as the subsidy basis by making the necessary adjustments) it might be announced as the basis subsidy for a specified time - say six months - when it would be revised by adjustment to meet the alterations in the price of spelter, coal and labour, and would then hold for another six &quot;months, but the scheme must be announced for a substantial period to get the new works running.The details of operation can be worked out when decisions have been given on the Items discussed in paragraph IX.   The new smelters will not be completed until a clear future is presented. Those charged with giving future decisions affecting costs of coal and labour should be kept au courant with the balance sheets of this and any other siml-lar ventures in which H.K.G. may become financially concerned, so that not only may the direct money cost to H.M.G. as regards Individual schemes be realised, but an index may fee-provided of the cost to industry at large.(1)(U)(ill)JAMES F.

- 5 -SUPPLEMENTAHY NOTE.With reference to the &quot;by-products derivable from smelting Australian concentrates, these arc scheduled below(l) sulphuric acid from the roasters;(2) zinc dust and/ ot Zinc Oxide;(3) Silver (recoverable from the residues;)(4) Load (recoverable from the residues.)With regard to acid it is problematical whether acid making from zinc Ore is going to o^ made to pay, certainly if it does pay business will have to bo carried on in conjunction with.othor industries such as Super phosphate making, in which case such profits as may be obtainable will have to be allocated against the acid and allied cr associated industry as a separate account.With regard to Zinc Dust and Zinc oxide, these substancus are in many smelters returned to the retorts in subsequent charging and the  inc content in them i3 recovered as Spelter; in any case tho production of Zinc Dust and Zinc oxide may be carried on only at the expense of Spelter and profits from neither of these materials will be of serious account.With regard to Silver and Lead, recovery would have to be started as a new industry, in this country.-Capital, would have to be obtained and the necessary knowledge and skill secured.   Before the War, Seaton Carew was practically the only work3 producing such material and it wont to the Continent for treatment, and anything from lo/- to 20/- par ton of spelter was reckoned as being the profit value of by-products in these residues - but this estimate is based on pre-war costs of coal and labour and it is certain that with coal and labour at anything like prc-sent prices   these estimates will be much reduced.Summarizing the above it would appear that possibly 10/- per ton of spelter is an outside estimate of the profit which could be allowed in respect of by-products - but it must be emphasised that this is an outside figure and with such a warning it would appear necessary for the purposes of this discussion to ignore the value af by-products in that the money value- represented con-stitutes such a small proportion of what appears to be the probable necessary bonus guarantee as to be comparable with the percentage errors in the data upon which the tabls of estimated subsidies has been calculated.JAMES F.

APPENDIX &quot;B&quot;Extract from Memorandum on the Spelter Industry in e. United Kingdom, dated, 4th April, 1919.(10) (D) Arrangements with the National smelting Company (Avonmouth).These are briefly as follows !-(1)   The Ministry of Munitions agreed to advance to the National smelting Company Limited the cost of con-structing up to a capacity fcr the treatment of 50.000 tons of concentrates per annum in the first instance, to he increased by a later date to be approved by the Minister, and in any case within five years from the termination of the present war, to a further 5o,000 tons of concentrates per annum, up to a total amount not exceeding  500,000 (the provisional estimate of the cost of the w*rk is  710,000 and the company are to be allowed a writing eff of 33       The advances to carry interest payable half-yearly at one-half of one per cent over the average Bank of England rate with a minimum of % per annum, and to be secured by the issue to Government nominees of debentures repayable at the expiration of ten years after the termination of the present war.   The Government to ,   have the right to appoint a director whilst any part of the advances, are outstanding (a   right not yet exercised).   The Minister has the right to enter upon the work and assume management and control on the ground of public interest, but not for the purpose of trading or dealing in spelter, etc.(2)   The Minister undertook to acquire land and construct sulphuric acid works and also to acquire land on which the company would erect Roasters, the Minister to pay the company the cost of the roasters, such cost to be deemed a part of the cost of the Sulphuric Acid works.   The Company were to operate the roasters and to pay the actual cost of roasting, but to be credited with 75$ of the value of sulphur contained in the con-centrates roasted.(3)   The Minister undertook to supply the company with 25,000 tons per annum of Australian concentrates on the terms upon which the Minister has purchased them under the agreement with the Zinc producers Association Limited.The Minister undertook to lease the acid works to the    t company after the war, the lessees to pay by way of rent a sum equal to Z5% of the net annual profits of the sulphuric acid works Or 6% upon the capital value of the leased promises which ever oum shall be greater or alternatively 5% upon the capital value of the premises with 10$ of the net profits; the capital upon which the rent is to be calculated was to be either 60% Of the cost of the sulphuric acid works and roasters or a figure fixed on a valuation by an independent valuer nominated by the president of the Institution of Civil Engineers.(4)
