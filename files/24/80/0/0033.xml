This Document is the Property of / mHi3 j.;....inri.:      ^--/&quot;j Qj/eminent.Proposed transfer of aeroplanes of the Royal Air Force to Dominions Governmentsv121ilThe Air Council have had before them, and have -forwarded to the Treasury, a request from the Canadian Air Force for the presentation to that force of ninety-two aero-planes and engines to assist the Canadian Government in starting a permanent Air Force*     In the viewjf the Council this request should be considered as a parTTof the general&apos;&quot;&quot; question whether, and if so under what conditions, the Governments of the Dominions should be assisted in initiating independent military Air Forces - a similar question has been raised on behalf of the Union of South Africa,The Council anticipate that the Cabinet will concur in their view that it is most desirable in the interests of imperial defence that the Imperial Government should readily assist in the formation of such forces.   They offer the following observations on the possibility of giving such assistance and the conditions under which it should he given.In accordance with the general policy approved by the Cabinet, surplus machines, etc., are now handed over to the Disposal Board.   The present state of the market for aeroplanes is understood to be governed by two factors (1)    * that the number of machines surplus to R.A.F. requirements is vastly greater than the demand and (2) that it is not profitable to keep machines for any length of time on account (a) of the cost of retaining storage accommodation anti-personnel to look after tham and (h) of the rapid decrc-r.se of the -value of a machine through deterioration if kept in store and because of constant improvements in design. The Disposal Board therefore in considering the disposal of surplus aeroplanes are brought up against two alternatives,,, either to throw all the machines on the market, in which case their value woiild fall to a small fraction of their cost of production, or to withhold the machines and sell only the small number that can be disposed of at a reasonable figure.     The Disposal Board has chosen the latter alternative,and their sales up to the present time have been small.     The problem of disposing of the stocks not saleable is therefore an urgent one and it has been represented that out of the superfluity of machines which may otherwise remain in store until their value has gone there is an opportunity of giving assistance to the Dominions which will be valued by them and which should be **&apos; of great use in the general interests of the defence of the Empire by air.In the view of the Air Council the best solution in all the circumstances will be to make a free gift of a certain number of machines..    In this way the pressure on storage space on account of a number of machines which there Jk is no .prospect of selling until they have become practically&apos;J[J useless will be alleviated to some extent and the course is recommended by the fact that in the view of the Disposal Board when every demand which can reasonably be foreseen is met, there would still remain a considerable surplus of machines of certain types which will at that time not have a higher value than scrap value because they have become obsolete or deteriorated through storage.P*T.O.
. I propose accordingly, for the approval of the War Cabinet, that when&apos;the Air Council has in stock 500 or more machines or engines.of any one type surplus to active and reserve requirements of the R.A.F. power should be given to put a number not exceeding 100 at&quot; the disposal of&quot;.a-Dominion free of,cost to enable-it to proceed with the formatloh of a Dominion Air Force.    The selection of machines would be made in consultation with the Disposal Board.(Intld.)21.5.19.
