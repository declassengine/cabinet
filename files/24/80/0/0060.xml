Thio Document is the Property erfu*. i&apos;&apos; *&apos; - *nn\% MaisstVs Government^&apos;^H^WW$m$for the War Cabinet by the Right Hon. .....V?alter He. Long, M.P.,It is necessary to come to a decision upon two questions: first, the future supply of motor cars for Government Offices; second, the control that shall be exercised over their use.Iftien I took over the control of petroleum, etc at the request of the Prime Minister I found numerous and very bad $buses *   I was able to cut down a great many cars and effect some     % -considerable improvement;   but I have not got the machinery, nor the time, nor-, indeed, have I got the right to exercise control which is essential as things are now.I think it would&apos;&quot;be. a very great mistake if all ^&quot;Government cars come to an end.   Let me put the matter very \S briefly, es^pjaaiiajs^^It is obvious that there must be always very great differencesmthofinancial position of Ministers.  A car&apos; is an essential if a Minister isJ to do the work which he is expected to perform in these days &apos;and therefore if each Minister is to provide his own car it means in the case of those Ministers who do not have cars of their own in private life, mulcting them to ,the extent probably of  500 to  600 a year of their salary.   This seems to me&quot; to be most utifair and wholly undemocratic.I should therefore boldly announce when the time comes that it has been decided to give each Minister who is tho; Head of a Department a motor car&apos;and driver provided by the State.Then as regards the Department;   sqme cars are essential the number must depend upon the requirements of each Department. I do not go into detail now* but I venture to recommend to the Cabinet(l) That the Minister of Supplies- shall control the supply of motor cars,(2) That a car shall be supplied to each Minister who is the ,     Head of a Department, as I have already suggested. (3) That each Department shall have allotted to it suchnumber of cars as can be shown to &quot;be essential for the efficient performance of its duties,tt And in order that the scheme should be worked satis-factorily I suggest that there should be a small Committee, presided over by the/Minister of Supplies, composed of&quot;any members whom the Cabinet may select, to work out the details and produce a plan.    Sir John Cadinan, Head of the Petroleum Executive would, I am convinced, by a very valuable,member of the Committee.:(Sd.)   1H. Long27 o 5 * 19 ois,1-
