This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.1480149 6597WAR CABINET.THE RAILWAY SITUATION IN SOUTH RUSSIA.Memoeandum by the Secretary of State for War.The condition of the railways in the area controlled by General Denikin in South Russia is very unsatisfactory. Their capacity has dropped to 20 per cent, as compared with pre-war days, and the quantity of stores on hand is barely sufficient for four months.This state of affairs is seriously affecting the military situation ; reports from the British Military Mission at Ekaterinodar make it clear that the defeat of the Don Cossacks earlier in the year (and the subsequent loss of a vast area of rich territory) was in no small measure due to this cause as the rapid transfer of reserves which were available on the Stavropol and Caspian fronts to the threatened point was rendered impossible by the inadequate railway service.Though the morale of the Volunteer Army is superior, they are greatly out-numbered by the enemy forces opposing them. It is therefore essential that General Denikin&apos;s organization should be sufficiently elastic and mobile to enable him to out-manoeuvre the Bolsheviks and thus maintain his present front while re-organizing and putting to effective use the large quantities of military stores which he is receiving from His Majesty&apos;s Government. Moreover, it is obviously quite useless to provide these stores without at the same time ensuring that means for their efficient distribution exist, and this can only be done by the supply of railway essentials which are asked for.The minimum value of the material required, based on requests from the Russian authorities and on reports from the technical experts attached to the British Military Mission, is estimated at 500,000/. for actual railway stores and a further 500,000/. for equipment, clothing and medical stores for the railway staff and certain lorries.5. The question has been taken up with the Supreme Economic Council in Paris, who were asked to provide the necessary funds from the .121 millions sterling available for relief. The request was, however, refused, as the area is not one for which the Supreme Economic Council has mads itself responsible for relief purposes.6. Two Missions one in Paris under a M. Dour no vo and another in London under a M. Porckhovshikov said to represent General Denikin, are negotiating, among other things, for railway material in exchange for grain. The success of their negotiations, however, is doubtful, and they are certain to be very protracted.7. Though it may be possible, ultimately, to secure a contribution from the Supreme Economic Council or to bring the negotiations, referred to in paragraph 6, to a successful conclusion, I submit that the matter is too urgent to admit of any further delay without seriously endangering the whole position in South Russia.It is urged that, for the reasons enumerated in paragraphs 2 and 3 above, the War Office should undertake to supply immediately the railway material for General Denikin&apos;s purely military needs.8. I am in some doubt as to whether the decision recorded by the War Cabinet at their meeting on 14th December&apos;, 1918 (W.C. 502 (5)), covers railway material, and would, therefore, ask for confirmation that I may proceed as recommended above.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.26th May, 1919.(B19/263)  70  5/19  H&amp;S  7l76wo
