-^-^maAcument is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government,!86CONFIDENTIAL.Political Intelligence Department, Foreign, Office,May 17, 1919.(11251.)Russia/025.LENIN&apos;S INTERNAL PROGRAMME.MEMORANDUMON^&quot;-&quot;^N the Petrograd official paper &quot; Severnaya Kommuna &quot; of the 22nd March a report is given of&apos;a speech by Lenin at the Eighth Congress of the Communist Party, in which he outlined the most important points of his programme for internal affairs. The whole speech is couched in his usual heavy and unattractive style, and, as usual, he is very theoretical and somewhat obscure when discussing questions such as imperialism and capitalism, but the speech contains many signs that he recognises the failure of the Soviet system as hitherto practised, and is now attempting to modify it in order, if possible, to stave off the inevitable collapse with which he is faced. The most interesting points in the speech are : &apos;1. The attempt to gain the support of the middle class peasants, whom he formerly denounced as bourgeois. The opposition of: the peasants to the Bolsheviks evidently shows him that extreme communism cannot succeed amongst the peasants, and for that reason he is, as usual, prepared to make temporary concessions in order to stop for the moment, if he can, the constant risings of the peasants. In spite of these proposals it is inconceivable that he will have the power to carry them out on the spot, as the local commissars pay little attention to the instructions of the Central Government, and only support the Bolsheviks in so far as it gives them an opportunity of enriching themselves at the expense of the peasants.2. The attempt to muzzle the co-operative societies. It is clear from this speech that officials from the co-operatives who openly protest against the coercion practised by the Bolsheviks are to be dispensed with, but others who take a more passive line are to be ind uced to continue their work in the societies. All kinds of inducements are held out to the specialists to continue, but no sign is given that the co-operatives will be allowed to continue their work as an independent organisation. They are simply to be used as part of the general Bolshevik machine.3. Vague promises are given that sooner or later the bourgeoisie are to be again given the privilege of voting. The usual excuses are made for having withdrawn the suffrage from the bourgeoisie, but the promise here given, by Lenin is of such a vague character that it is most unlikely to produce any marked effect.Lenin discussed the various points of his programme as follows :  1. Imperialism and Capitalism. *&quot; Pure imperialism without the fundamental basis of capitalism has never existed anywhere. Imperialism and financial capitalism are the superstructure built upon the old mercantile capitalism. Now, not only in Russia and in Germany, but also in the victorious countries, there is beginning precisely such a gigantic dissolution of capital, which everywhere is removing this artificial apparatus and reviving the old capitalism.&quot; What is the meaning of the breakdown of transport in the capitalistic system ? It means a return to the most rudimentary forms of the production of goods. That capitalism which was outlined in the old programme continues to remain in 1919 in the Soviet proletarian republic. There is no escape from that. That is why, if our programme is to be a true one, it must state facts as they are. There is the old capitalism which in a whole series of spheres has grown to imperialism. Its tendency is wholly imperialistic. Fundamental problems can be examined only from the point of view of imperialism. There is the superstructure imperialism, which has led to the war, and out of this war arose the beginnings of the proletarian dictatorship. But the subsoil is the old capitalism. This fact characterises the development of a proletarian revolution in the whole world, and will remain a factor for many years to come. We have arrived at a dictatorship, but it is important to know how we have arrived. The past holds us, beizes us with its thousand hands, and does not allow us to take a step forward, or compels us to take this step badly, as we are doing. In order to understand the situation into which we are falling, it is necessary to state in the programme how we have advanced and what has led us to the Socialist revolution.[1130]-640
u2. National Questions,&quot; The same is true with regard to national questions. Comrade Bukharin says: &apos;A nation means the bourgeoisie together with the proletariat. It is not at all incon-gruous to recognise the right of self-determination of the detested bourgeoisie.&apos; No, pardon me, it is incongruous with that which is. You refer to the protest of the differentiation of the proletariat from tho bourgeoisie, hut let us yet see how it will go further. Let us take, as an example, Germany, a model of a leadimg capitalistic country. Did the German proletariat differentiate from the bourgeoisie f No. As it happens, only in some of the large towns were the majority of the workmen opposed to the Scheidemannitefs. Look at Finland. It mav be considered among the most developed, most cultured, and most democratic countries. The process of the differen-negotiation of the proletariat is going on in its own way and much more painfully. But thanks to the fact that we have recognised the right of nations to self-determination, the process of differentiation has been lightened.&quot; It is necessary to await the development in every- nation of this differentiation of the proletariat from the bourgeoisie, which is inevitable. We should propagandise this differentiation, but at present we must recognise the right of every nation to self-determination. To recognise the right of self-determination as belonging only to the working class means to recognise that it actually does not exist in any country except in Russia. The result is not a programme, hut a proclamation. It is necessary to consider in what degree stands the given nation on the road from the Middle Ages to a bourgeois democracy, and from a bourgeois democracy to a proletarian democracy. This road is wholly unknown ; 95-hundredths of the entire population of the earth are in this category, because they are either on the road from the Middle Ages to a bourgeois democracy, or from a bourgeois to a proletarian. Not to recognise the actual facts is impossible. Of themselves they will force recognition The working men abroad are being frightened by the idea that the Bolsheviks wish to introduce their universal system everywhere by means of the Red Army. Not by means of violence will communism be inculcated. Every nation should receive the right of self-deter-mination, and this will facilitate the self-determination of the workers.&quot;With regard to the middle-class peasantry, the policy of the Russian Communist Party is gradually and systematically to include it in the work of socialistic construc-tion. The party defines as its problem the separation of the middle-class peasants from the well-to-do, and draws the former to the side of the working class by an attentive attitude to its needs, fighting for it, striving in all cases, where its vital interests are concerned, to come to a practical agreement with it, making concessions to it in the introduction of socialist reforms. Thus is our attitude towards the middle-class peasantry formulated in the new programme. We should especially emphasise our persevering attitude towards the middle-class peasantry, and devise a whole series of increasingly concrete measures which would immediately give something to the middle-class peasantry, inasmuch as this is urgently demanded by the character of the struggle against all our enemies, who know that the middle-class peasant is wavering between them and us, and who are trying to draw him away from us.. 3. Concerning Co-operation.&quot;Then concerning co-operation. The paragraph in the new programme is to a certain extent belated, inasmuch as there is a new decree concerning the merging of all kinds of co-operation into one consumers&apos; commune. If this decree has not already been published, it will be published either to-morrow or the day after. Nevertheless, the paragraph concerning co-operation is necessary because we know very well that from the decrees to their fulfilment the distance is quite considerable. The apparatus of co-operation, as the only one which capitalism has prepared among the masses, which alone is operating among the village masses, still standing in the stage of primitive capitalism, should at all costs be modified, developed, and not cast aside. Here the problem is a difficult one, because in most cases the co-operatives have at their head bourgeois specialists, invariably White Guards. It is necessary to cut short the counter-revolutionary inclinations of the co-operatives, but at the same time there should not be any struggle against the apparatus of co-operation. The question of bourgeois specialists in the army, in industry, and in the co-operative societies calls forth no little controversy and acute differences. this question should definitely he settled at the present Congress. We can establish communism only when the resources of bourgeois science and technical knowledge shall make it more accessible to the masses.   And for this it is necessary to take the apparatus from the lourgeoisie
and to attract to the work all specialists, Without the bourgeois specialists it is impossible to raise up the productive forces. Of course, the majority of these specialists are permeated through and through with a bourgeois outlook on life. They must be surrounded by an atmosphere of comradely co-operation, by workmen, commissars, and communists, and should be placed in such conditions that they cannot get away, but they must also be given the possibility of working better than under the capitalists, because this class, trained as it has been by the bourgeoisie, will not begin to work otherwise. To force a whole class to work by means of the stick is impossible. It is possible to prevent their active. participation in counter-revolution; it is necessary to make them afraid to respond to White Guard proclamations. In this direction we have done a great deal, but that is not enough. Bourgeois specialists have become accustomed to cultural work, which they accomplished within the frame of the bourgeois order, i.e., they enriched the bourgeoisie with huge material under-takings and in insignificant doses dealt out a portion to the proletariat. Nevertheless, they advanced culture that is their profession. In so far as they see that the working class not only values culture, but even assists in developing it among the masses, to that extent they change their attitude towards us. They should also be subjugated morally and not merely politically estranged from the bourgeoisie. We must draw them into our apparatus, and for this we must sometimes make sacrifices. In our relations with specialists we must &quot;not maintain a policy of petty cavilling.&quot; We must give them the best possible conditions of existence. That is our best policy. Otherwise we shall manage to economise several hundreds of millions, but may lose so much that no milliards will make up for it. We have already achieved a tremendous rupture in the wavering intelligentsia. If we have spoken yester-day concerning the legalisation of the petty bourgeois parties, and have arrested to-day the Mensheviks and the Left Social Revolutionaries, there is at any rate one firm line in all this wavering to destroy counter-revolution and to make use of the cultural bourgeois apparatus.   - &amp;4. Concerning Bureaucracy.&quot; Then there is the question of bureaucracy. Undoubtedly the complaints against this have a basis. Here we are suffering because Russia has been insufficiently developed. The bureaucracy of the Tsar&apos;s regime began to enter the Soviet departments, but the most successful arena for this appeared to be the Russian Communist Party. Of course it was possible to dismiss the bureaucrats, but it is impossible immediately to re-educate them. To fight with bureaucracy to the end to final victory is only possible when the entire population will share in the government. The class of workmen who are governing is incredibly small, and it is essential to attract the wide masses to governing. The tremendous attention and the tremendous success in educating the working masses give us the assurance that in the near future we shall possess a huge reserve which will -occupy places in the Soviet departments.5. The Bourgeoisie and Voting Eights.&quot;The deprivation of the bourgeoisie was never considered by the party from the absolute point of view. It is theoretically permissible for the dictatorship of the proletariat to oppress the bourgeoisie at every step, but it is possible also not to deprive it of voting rights. Before and after the October Revolution no one ejected the bourgeoisie from the Soviets. They le,ft the Soviets of their own accord. Our constitution established inequality of voting rignts only after this state of affairs had been created by facts. But we do not transform this into an ideal; on the contrary, we are obliged by the programme of the party to work systematically to destroy inequality.&quot;
