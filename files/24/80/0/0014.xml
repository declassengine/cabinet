Crops on the whole look well, though winter wheat is backward.The settlers have done a large amount of work on their holdings and some have planted part of their holdings with fruit. atrington,   132 acres of seed3 and 27 acres of roots have been sown during the week,,     The grass is now growing well, and all stock, witii the exception of a few bullocks to be &quot;finished off&quot; in the yards, have been turned out.     A sot of steam taoklo has been ordered and it is anticipated that this will be delivered in June.     It will be chiefly utilised on the bare fallows at Old Kail Parm recently acquired by the Board.Hoi 1 e,pton and Overhaim. This settlement was visited during the weCSe, Crops on&quot;&quot;tne whole look well, though winter wheat is backward, At the Overhaul part of the estate all the spring corn has now been sown and spring oats are coming on well.Pembrey.     90 acres have now been sewn;   a further 20 acres have&quot;&quot;yet &quot;to be put in.     The grass is growing well and there is now plenty of keep,     iiiwes and lambs for raising on the Salt Marsh will be bought before the end of the month.(ii) Work of Agricultural &apos;&amp;cecutive Committees.Malt for Harvest Beer.     The Ministry of Pood have agreed to release a 1 LFit-31 quantity of malt for the home Brewing of harvest beer.     The arrangements will be similar to those made last year and in 1917, that is to say, the Agricultural Executive Committees for those Counties in which horns brewing is an established custom will be authorised to issue permits to applicants for an amount not exceeding two bushels of malt for each labourer.     The necessary instructions have been sent to the Committees concerned.
Cultivation of lands /Committees) Order,, 3.919;,     This Order provides that the Agricultural jiEecutive CommiTtei&quot; for each County shall consist, unless the Board by : Order otherwise direct of 12 members of whom 8 shall be appointed by the County Council and 4 by the Board.     Special Orders have been made enlarging the Executive Committees for the Counties of Bucks, Lancashire, Nottingham, Surrey and the West Riding, to 15 members of whom 10 are to be appointed by tho County Council and 5 by the Board.(iii)   Land Drainagte.Some of the work carried out by the Agricultural Executive Committees has been inspected duritng the past week on behalf of the Department.In Bedfordshire the Ivel has been cleared for 4-J- miles and flood banks have been repaired of build throughout that length wherever necessary.     The complete, scheme is for the clearing of   9 miles,     Five miles of the subsidiary brooks have also been cleared;   about l-J- miles of these brook3 have been half cleared and about 10 miles remain to be done.     The average number of men employed has been 150     . (all prisoners of faar) during seven months actual work, but they were greatly impeded by floods during the winter.     The results of the work done have been excellent.In Huntingdonshire the removal of the -main obstructions in the Ouse.between. Huntingdon and St, Ives, a length of about 6 miles, has been partially carried out and will take between one and two months to complete,     400 yards of flood bank have been rebuilt,     It is hoped that thiB may be done before the prisoners leave,     In the same period it is proposed to cut a channel down the middle of the branch or backwater running,from the Portholme at Godmanchester to Hartford, which is almost completely silted up and overgrown^ If this channel is cut, it will furnish a valuable passage for storm water and help to relieve the floods above Godmanchester, It is also proposed to carry out about a fortnight&apos;s work on the river Kym which is necessary in order to pass away flood water from above the congested portion.(iv)   Tithe, Commons, Oopyhold and Survey.During the past week five hearings of objections to Schedules of Assessments of redemption money and expenses have been held in compulsory redemption cases affecting lands in the Parishes of Hawkhurst (KentK Port sea (Southampton), Hugglescote (Leicester), Cheriton (Kent), and Prittlewell (iissex)., respectively.The Board have had under consideration the desirability of extending the employment of valuers in compulsory redemptions of tithe rentcharge and corn rents.   It has been decided (1) to appoint as valuer any suitable person nominated by the titheowner applying for redemption, not restricting appointments, as heretofore, to the few gentlemen
who have acted as valuers in redemption cases for many years past, and (2) that the practice of refusing to appoint valuers in any compulsory redemptions affecting undivided lands should he abandoned*     A more generous scale of remuneration to valuers has been adopted.The Board have approved a rate of lOd. per stint to be levied by the Conservators of West Tilbury Regulated Commons (i^ssex) upon the respective stint owners, to meet the expenses incurred by the Conservators in the execution of their duties.     In the case of V/inton and Kaber Regulated Commons (Westmorland) a rate of 8d* per stint to be levied by the Conservators has been sanctioned by the Board.Commercial Division. -Buildings.     The first part of the Manual dealing with Cottages for Small Holdings is now in the Press and copies will be circulated very shortly.    ThG seoond part, containing further plans and details for housing and type plans for farm buildings is in course of preparation.-Anglesey and Hunts County Councils have submitted preliminary applications for small holding building schemes with a view to the early commencement of work.     The Wallsall Borough Council Scheme for 20 cottage holdings of one acre each has been approved, subject to the final submission of working drawings.     The estimated cost of these cottages and equipment has been revised and the Council has been instructed to proceed with the contract drawings in order to obtain tenders at the earliest possible date.fertilisers.     The deliveries of Sulphate of Ammonia for agricultural purposes during the 11 months of the present season &apos; amount to 240,000 tons as against 214,000 tons in a similar period last year.     In the case of &quot;Basic Slag, the comparative figures are 505,000 tons as against 447,000 tons.The Pertiliser Manufacturers Association is issuing a Notice to the press pointing out that Superphosphate has been sold during the past two years at a price below the cost of production owing to the assistance given to the industry by the State, and that this Government aid has now been withdrawn. They add that &quot;the farmers of the country must therefore anticipate, after the close of the present month, a substantial increase in the price of Superphosphate and Compound Manures, which will continue until such time as oversea freights return to a more or less normal level,&quot;Representations have been made by the Board to the Shipping Controller with a view to securing facilities for the importation of Phosphate Rock, and it is not anticipated that there will be any dilficulty in providing the necessary ships, but the Trade will have to pay the current commercial rates of freight. &apos;
Feeding Stuffs/     The accumulated stocks of Hi Hers Offals which were re-ceiitly causing severe congestion at some of the large Mills have now teen cleared, and in some parts of the country the demand exceeds the supply.     This result has been secured to a large extent by the reduction in price of  2 per ton which was authorised by the Treasury, but as this reduction was only authorised for /the particular purpose of clearing supplies, the Treasury now suggest that the rate should be  * again increased.     The J?lour kills Control Committee recommend that the price of fine Offals should be advanced from  12 to  13. per ton, leaving the price of bran for the present undisturbed at  11 per ton.Inspection of Growing Crops of Potatoes of Immune Varieties. Publicity has been given to the, arrangements which the Board is making for free inspection of crops during the coming summer. Applications for inspection have already been received.Cases have been brought to the notice of the Board where the particulars required by the Seed Potatoes Order of -1918 have not been declared on. the invoice relating to sales of seed potatoes.     Steps are being taken to bring to the notice of merchants the necessity for providing the information required.Root......Seed.....Outlook.     Reports obtained from the principalSeed Houses indicate&quot; that the acreage for which contracts have been placed for mangel, turnip and swede seed to be harvested this year is larger than last year and considerably greater than the pre wax figure.     Owing however to the bad weather Bid the lateness of the season the plants in many cases are in a very unsatisfactory condition and a larger proportion of failures than usual is anticipated.Seed Matures for temporary leys,     The heavy demand for seed mixtures TP or temporary leys is understood to be unprecedented, particularly so late in the season,     Pew seedsmen appear to have been prepared for these late require-ments and considerable difficulty is being experienced in obtaining the necessary seed for the mixtures.Horticultural Division,County Organisation.Some r sets hi re j,     The newly appointed Agricultural Organiser for the County has been interviewed with regard to the new Horticultural Sub-Committee. and names of suitable men to act on the Committee are being procured.     The Organiser is in : favour of sub-dividing the county into two or. mere areas, and appointing a Horticultural Instructor for each.The Horticultural Instructor reports that he has received many applications for labour for pruning and spraying next autumn, as the result of the work done.by soldier labour in the past year.
Hampshire.   County Council officials of Hampshire and West Sussex hove &quot;been interviewed with the object of spading up the formation of Horticultural Sub-Committees, and in the framing af schemes for the future development of Horticulture and Horticultural instruction.    West Sussex propose to appoint an Organiser and intend to develop Horticulture very fully.Scke of^Peteybp^oti/yh.   The question of Horticultural Snstruotion in this area is receiving attention, but the authorities are not helpful.    A visit was paid to the Education Secretary at Peterborough, and the whole subject of the constitution of the new Horticultural Committee was thoroughly discussed.    He is of opinion that when the new Agricultural Committee has bebn formed, the Sub-Committee for Horticulture will follow asa matter of course.Keojueyjm   (Lincolnshire)   2he Agricultural Organised here was interviewed&quot;.    H3 has presented a report to his Committee emphasising the need far a mare thorough exploitation of Horticulture in Kesteven, and suggests the appointment of a Horticultural flvganiaer at a good salary.Pembroke.    A visit was paid to the Agricultural Organiser for Pembroke.    &apos;^ho County Authorities propose to establich a faua school, and horticulture will also reoeive attention.        &quot;5t is suggested to have demonstration plete for cottagers.The Horticultural Organiser stated that the lack of transport wasthe chief difficulty in regard to increased production.The Annual Conferenos held at Callingtbn during the week by the Tamar Valley Fruit Growers^ Association, at which arrangements are mado for the Pvuit Traffio for the season, was attended.The opportunity was tak^n of explaining the way in which the Horticultural Division of the Beard would assist the grcssers in the district.Special emphasis was made of the necessity for:-(l)   Better cultivation of Plums and Apples.    The cultivation of these.fruits is poor chiefly due to absenoe of steps to control disease.     Caterpillar attacks and silver leatf are r48ponsible for great loss in production.    She means to be taken to remedy this state of affairs were explained in detail.(2)   Gooseberries.   Bad attacks of American Goc-eeberry Mildew Have been experienced in this district for several years past, although no disease has been noticed this year.     The absolute necessity of taking steps for reducing this epidemic wa3 emphasised;   growers are as a general rule on trying out the recommendations made last year,    Most plantations were &quot;tipped&quot; early last autumn,     If this is continued asan annual operation and preventive sprayings with Lime-Sulphur are made each spring there seem to be no reasons why the disease should do much damage.(3)   The chief difficulty experienced in the control of pests is the want of efficient spraying taokle especially for spraying top trees.     The suggestion has been made that the Association^ Basket factory which ia the centre of the
Co-operative movement in tho district should purchase a?ower spraving plant and hire to members of the Asscota-ii--n.   In this way the plantati -ins in the district ould be rapidly and effectively sprayed.    The suggestion hn&amp; bean accepted, and it is proposed to hare a plant available for use next season.Red plant in strawberries.   This trouble is the cause of muclTloee in&quot;the str^vTberry plantation of the district.    It appears to be a form of reversion eometjMit-similar to that %f Blatk Currants.    Arrangements are being made to have the cause of the trouble investigated.Messrs Chivers farms at lakenheath were visited. The training ef ex-service men has started, and most of the men are very keen, and should do well.A large number of letters are being received doily enquiring for particulars cf the Restocking scheme, and expressing a: desire to obtain nuclei.    It seems evident that many will be . disappointed in being unable to participate as letters are being reeeived from counties where the Bub-Committee had decided net toi undertake the work.    Although 268 stocks have been dispatched, throughout the country, there is every reason ta believe that aI much larger number could have been disposed of had the scheme been taken up more thoroughly by all the County Bee Committoes.fcorvfttien of ffruit and Vegetables.A very successful exhibit has this w*&amp;k been shewn at the disabled Service Hen&apos;8 Exhibition, Cutler&apos;s Hall, Sheffield    Huch j interest has be^n takan in the processes of fruit and vegetable preservation by the organisers of this exhibition with a view to forming depots for disabled men.An exhibit was also sent to&apos; Spa Pavilion, Pelixttowe,   and from reports received has aroused great interest.The d;*te proposed for the commencement of the courses in fruit and vegetable preservation is Monday, lay 26th, when it is hoped th?5t candidates appointed by the Agricultural Education Committees will attend and reoeive complete training in the methods of fruit and vegetable preservation.II Live Stock.Pifts.    A Club has been formed in Wickford consisting of 14 members at present, but several other applications have been received.    Literature dealing with tha question ef ths* formation of Pig Clubs togeth r with membership rules and ineur*nse has been forwarded to the Secretary.Poultry.   A number if ex-sorvioe men hfcve been interviewed * during the week, and the facilities available in ctnneotion with training in poultry farming have been explained te them.    A discharged seldisr, Ilr, Morgan, Barking, stated that he had received  40 from the Kings Pund to enable him to commt;noe poultry farming, and desired the assistance of the Board.    His application for a piwer, of land, and a houo   to live in is receiving attention.(41keeping,
Technical nnd Cultivation Diyision. tnical Section.Inspection of Land, (l)     A serious failure of winter whent on old grass lnnd^bvoken &quot;up in 1917 was reported from Rutland, and samples of plants forwarded to the Board showed that the \7hoat Bulb Ply was present in numbers, together with wivow/rma.     As it was impossible to decide from the samples which of these pests was chiefly responsible for the damage, an inspection of the affected field was mad;.&apos; by one of the Technical Advisers.The wheat stood the winter well and early in tho present spring promised ?n excellent crop.    By the beginning of May, however, large pwtehee Quickly died off.     An examination showed that these patches &quot;r-re dry and spongy and poorly consolidated;   damper parts of the fi^ld wher^ the ground was firmer and the old turf more rotten, still gave promise of a good crop,MumeroUr wireworms were present in the p, f ec&amp;dareaa, but no larvae of the Whetft Bulb Ply w^re found, a fact almost certainly due to their having pupated.While wiveworms were no doubt responsible for much of the damage, it seemed clear the cultural deficiencies were important contributory cause a.An adjoining field of the same character brwken up at about the same time carried a good crop of winter oats in 1918.     A small part of this field was? jtgnin put to win bar oats, which look well, but winter wheat on the reet of the field is going off in patches in a similar manner to the last field,(2)      An inspection wast recently made of the country in the neighbourhood of Holbeach, in view of a proposal to lay down a system of light railways radiating from Holbeach, to tap the particularly rich and highly cultivated land in the neighbourhood.     About one-third of the land affected, whioh is almost all arable, is annually under potatoes, which h^ve to be carted 5 or 5 miles to the nearest station.     In this district, owing to the distance that road-making materials have to be brought, it would probably be impossible to keep the roads in sufficiently good condition for motor lorries, and a system of light railways or tramways should effect an appreciable saving as compared with cartirg and perhaps even mere in the form of economy in we?&apos;&amp; find tear of roads, and it should help to maintain production in the district at its present high level and in some cases even to increase it.jjotor Section.During the week ended 2nd May, 3244 tractors wore in tho hand? of Committees nnd 1126 of these wore being operated under the now tractor scheme.     Of the 2118 operated by Committees directly, 270 w;:-re being got ready for sale, leaving 1848 available.     Of these, 1147 (or 62%) wore in commission *nd were idle for one third of the time on account of bad weather,      331 tractors were idle for Jack of work, 317 were under repair, and 53 were not being worked for lack of labour, fIn England and Wales 6016 acres were ploughed and 12330 acres cultivated by 1489 tractors giving an average of 4,04 acres and 8.61 acres -respectively.     The acreage dealt with shows a decrease from the previous we.:k of 30 per cent in the case of ploughing and 27 per cent in the case of cultivating.     The highest average vae reported in Anglesey where 32 tractors ploughed 124 acres
and cultivated 498:   average 3.9 acres and 15.6 acres respectively.Mechanical Scttion,Great difficulty has been experienced fgr some wesks in , obtaining certain of the most important spare parts for Fordson Tractors, which are supplied by Henry Pord &amp; Son under agreement wi$h this Department.    The firm now state tot they will be in a position to recommence delivery within a few days.Requirements and Disposal Section,During the we ?k ended 17th May, returns of sales hove been forwarded by Pembroke. Hereford, Bly, Cumberland, Staffordshire, Rutland, Carmarthen, Denb^jh, Bast Suffolk, Leicester, llenmouth, Somerset, East Sussex, Essex, Holland and Northumberland,The returns show that the following have been disposed of1$84 TrtiCtors1382 Traotor ploughs858 Miscellaneous Tractor Implements916 Binders 61 Mowers and Reapers 2636 Horse Ploughs676 Drills817 Carts and Lorries 2152 Harrows and Cultivators 1159 Rollers and Preesers95 Potato Diggers37 Spraying Mnohines 2795 whippletrees *10 Threshing Machines. 300,897, 2, 4, has been realised in respect of the sale *f the machinery and implements cbeve enum rated.Up to date 330 sales have been held for which 295 returns touve been submitted.   77 further sales hsve been arranged.Good prices still obtain.    Fordson tractors with Oliver ploughs have averaged  165 and TiUn traet--.rs have realised from  150 to  235.    All horse implements are maintaining high prices, especially binders,    Deering and KcCormiok types are the most popular and secure prices ranging from  45 to  65 according to condition.   In Derby *nd Notts threshing machines have been sold to small farmers and in eaoh case at their full cost price.Horse Section.The total number of horses sold to date iB 5,200,Definite arrangements have been made to cell 698 horses before the 31st Hay.     300 will be sold in Wales and 200 in England during the first week of June, and a considerable number will beduring the week the Glamorgan and Staffordshire Committees notified their intention to dispose of all the tractors after the 31st May,    Definite proposals have not yet been submitted by two Committees, Cardigan and Westaorland.     The number of tractors to be retained after the end of Kay is now approximately 1300 out of a total of 4000.Price of Petrol.   During the week the: Department reived information that petrol would b* reduced 2-j-d per gallon as from the 19th instant.    Tlfc- price of petrol (lTo.1) is now 2/8 per gallon and petrol (lo* g) 2/6 per gallon.
handed over to Committees for work on land in their occupation at the average price which the surplus horses have made in the county. This method of transferring the horses from one branch of the Board to the other is very much to the advantage of the Committees&apos; farms since the youngest son best horses are selected which would realise at least 25% more than the price at which they were taken over.

Arrangements have been made with Messrs Aldridge, Auctioneers, to hold a further sale of harness at the Base Supply Depot at the end of the month.

? Tackle Section.

Returns received from 168 steam tackle owners of work done for the week ended 11th May show the following results:- ploughed 2,057 acres (12.24 acres per set), cultivated 10,003 acres (59.54 per set), harrowed 2,456 acres (14.67 per set) and mole drained 1,171 acres (7 acres per set). Total 15,696 acres, giving an average of 93.42 acres per set.

The counties of Dorsetshire, Essex, Lincolnshire, Oxfordshire and Yorkshire show the largest acreage worked. The work of mole draining was carried out principally in Cambridgeshire and Essex.

Labour Division

Training of ex-service men. The number of ex-Service men who are at present receiving training in the Centres that have been set up by the Board for inexperienced men is as follows:-

Brentwood, Essex, (tractor driving) 115

Shippea Hill, Suffolk, (vegetable and Fruit growing) 25

Bulcote, Nottingham, 25

Dunston, Strafford 8

Stockport, Cheshire 6

Total: 179



Several other Centres in various parts of the country are about to be opened. The number of agriculturists demobilised during the seven days ended 14th May was 3,572, making the total number of such men released up to that date 222,393.



Soldier Labour. The number of soldiers remaining in or attached to the Agricultureal Companies at the end of the week was 22,144.



Harvest Labour. A scheme for the employment on unskilled seasonal work of unemployed civilians with no experience of agriculture has been submitted to the ? for approval. Although a considerable number of agriculturists who joined the Forces have been demobilised, many men from the agricultural industry are being retained in the Armies of Occupation and therefore will not be available to assist with the togethering of the harvest during the present year. The additional area of land placed under crops will also require at harvest time labour in ? of that available before war broke out. Moreover, in many districts where no cottages exist, Prisoners of War have been placed in a central building and farmers in the vicinity have ploughed up extra land using to the availability of this labour. The repatriation of the prisoners is now likely at an early date and steps must be taken to provide other labour in order that farmers may be able to harvest the crops they have grown. The Treasury have been


requested to authorise at an early date the expenditure that will he incurred in providing depots   in which civilians can he housed in substitution for tho Prisoners of War.   Most of tho expenditure will &quot;bo recouped by charges to the labourers in respect of the cost of board and lodging.Application has also been made to the Treasury with a view to the arrangements for the provision of cheap rrilwey facilities for seasonal workers that were in force during the year 1918 being continued during the pre Pent yea??.    This concession allowed &quot;the Board to issue to bona- fide seasonal Wovkevs on thf land a return railway ticket at a fare of 1-j single fare, pre-war rates.Women1 s Branch.The demand for woman labour has increased during the past weeko There is evidence that this demand would be greater than it is if there was more certainty about the German prisoner labour and the soldiers. The farmers are unwilling to give their prospective demands until the position in regard to male labour is better known,,0wing to the increased minimum wage for men, there was a tendency on the part of some farmers to employ women as cheaper labour.     The balance however has been restored by the recent decision to raise the minimum wage vf the Land Army to 25/-*     At the same time as this decision was made, the Central Wages Board happened to enact the billeting for the different counties.    This was&quot;put at so low a figure - 11a. to 13s c - that the farmer was compelled to increase the payment to the Land Army woman when living in.     The result has been that in those districts where tire billeting, rate is as low as 11/- many woman are being returned to depot, while in the districts where tho biJiUvcing rate is higher there is no difficulty in securing them employmentaIn connection with the Suffolk Agricultural Show to be held in June, prizes have been offered for the best thatching by wwnoeu A special course of instruction in thatching was arranged through the women1 s organization in the County,     At first it met with muchopposition from the local farmers, but the plan was carried through,.....a fortnight&apos;s training givsn to eight members of the Land Army and a test held - local farmers and Miss Howard, Technical Inspector, acting as judges,     three prizes were to be awarded, but as the standard all through was of such a high nature, five wore ultimately decided upon.At a milking test held recently in Oxfordshire, the girls entering for the test obtained a greater quantity cf milk than was obtained from the same cows by their normal milkers,WomenT3 Institutes.    five new Institutes were started.last week,&quot;&quot;making&quot;a total If 1,061.The Higher Education Sub-Committee of the &quot;West Sussex Education Committee have approved of the list of subjects, put forward by the Steyning Women&apos;s Institute, in which the Education Committee will give instruction.

Many of these reports were not justified, the dog in many cases showing no signs of illness, the report being due to the fact that the animal had bitten or flown at some person.

The Board, while aware that this was innocuous to fish life, had to take into account the possibility of large masses being driven ashore where it might interfere with purely local industries like shrimping. They accordingly fixed one site for the first dumping (150 tons) and a further site for the remaining five dumpings, viz. along the Leman Hasks Lighthouse line.     The Ministry claimed that this was too far away and too expensive, and asked to dump in the Channel. To this the Board could not agree, but laid down a nearer line. It is understood that on the score of expense and of the harmlessness of the material, the Ministry will not accept this area, and propose to dump where they like.     It may be necessary for the Board to take up a strong attitude with the Ministry,Intelligence Division,33d uc&apos;at 1 o n t Bra nch.A report has been prepared giving an account of the work of the Branch in the financial years 1917-8 and 1918-9 with regard to the distribution of grants for Agricultural Education and Research.

Completion of Training at Agricultural Colleges.The Treasury have raised no objection to a proposal by the Board that &quot;farm trainees&quot; should in approved cases complete their&apos; training at Agricultural Colleges - the trainee continuing whilst at the College to receive &quot;farm training&apos;5 maintenance allowances, but himself paying his College fees.The Treasury have raised some difficulty as to the paying of  125 maintenance allowance as a flat rate to a farm trainee, and point out that the rate mentioned must be regarded as a maximum and that in. assessing an allowance regard must be had to the financial position of the applicant,,     The position
taken up by the Treaoury is an impossible one as they made no such condition in originally authorising tho payment of these allowances.; and the Board are committed to a flat rate by announcements in the Press, in tfe\e officers Land Settlement Booklet, and to County Committees, etc     A reply to the Treasury is being prepared accordingly.Rank of Candidatea,Of the successful candidates, so far, for scholarships 1 in 3 is below the rank of &quot;Officer&quot;;.- and ouriously enough the same proportion exists sin the case of farm training candidateso Of those rejected, the proportion is 4 in 7 in the case of scholarship applicants and 1 in 2 in the case cf farm training applicantSc     Those figures form an effective reply to any criticism that the educated man in the ranks is being neglected.Circular Letter to County Committees,A Circular Letter has been issued to the County       ., Committees expressing appreciation at the satisfactory progress of farm training;   pointing out one or two weak points in local administration;   and exp3aining a number of administrative matters which have arisen0       *Assistance ,t6 County Committees by Board?s Ceirrcissioners.By arrangement with the Land Division, a Memorandum has been issued to the Board1s Commissioners and Sub-Ccmmissioners asking them to assist County Committees in che local administration of the Scheme, if requested, and without infringing upon the responsibility of the County Council for executive aotionj   and also asking them to put suitable farmers who are willing to accept &quot;officer pupils&quot; in direct touch with the County Committees,fflax Productjcn Branch,The output of Seed during the week ending the 15th May was lf495 owtsc making a total to date of 3,592 tons at the 3Q) deseeding stations.
