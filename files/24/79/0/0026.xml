G.T.7226

FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES, IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 7th May, 1919.

The following is a brief statement on the work of Department during the past week in furtherance of increased  Production In Ireland:-

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

The number of applications for loans for the purchase of machinery received during the past week was 31, and the ? value of the machinery ordered to date is £l7,422.

During the month of April this year, there was an increase in the number of applications of 20 per cent, as compared with ? number received in the corresponding month last year. The number received last month is even slightly in excess of the number received ? April 1917, when the demand for loans could be described as abnormal. ? demand for loans for tractors has decreased.

TILLAGE SECTION.

During the past week Notices of the Department&apos;s ? to make certificates of default were served on 13 copiers who, in the opinion of the Department, had failed, without ? cause, to cultivate the minimum tillage portions of their ? in 1918.

Th holdings are situated in Counties Galway, ?, Limerick, Meath, Tipperary and Wexford, and the penalties prescribed vary in amount from £50 to £427. 10.

PROGRESS OF FARM WORK.

The weather conditions in northern counties at the beginning of the week were wintry - snow falling on two days. Sowing of grain and flax was interrupted but farmers were able to proceed with preparations for potato planting. In other parts of the country the sowing of oats and potatoes is practically completed. Early sowings of oats in these districts are making rapid growth.

Considerable areas of mangels were sown in ? oounties during the week, and preparations for this crop and for turnips are being pushed forward everywhere.

Despite some cold showers the growth of grass improved considerably, and as there is a fair supply of roots in many places there is little danger of a serious foddor shortage. Supplies of hay and feeding straw are, however, extremely low on the majority of farms.

7/5/19.
FARM LABOUR.

The labour situation has somewhat improved and at ? the number of strikes in progress is limited.

TURF FOR FUEL.

In some districts field work is now giving place to ? cutting. Owing to to the scarcity of coal and the remunerative prices realised for turf last winter it is anticipated ? a larger quantity of turf fuel will be saved this year.

FLAX.

Flax Growing Operations. The weather being favourable, sowing of flaxseed was fairly general towards the end of the week.

Labour. A settlement has not yet been arrived at in the dispute existing in County Donegal, but the strike appears to be collapsing. The majority of the scutchers who struck work in ? with the farm labourers have returned to work.

Demand for Flaxseed. A considerable numbor of ? deferred buying flaxseed until their preparations for sowing were almost completeted. A brisk demand for seed last week is ?. Farmers are now aware that further supplies of Dutch seed unobtainable, and Canadian (fibre variety) and Japanese seed are consequently being purchased Creoly.

English Flaxseed. About 20,000 bags of seed from England and Scotland were imported into Ireland this season.   About 70 percent of this seed was found on arrival in Belfast to be of an unsatisfactory germinating quality, and it was decided, therefore, by the Ministry of Munitions Flax Seed Committee, in consultation with the Department, that seed of this description should not be distributed for sowing purposes in Ireland. After being stored for a time, some of the seed, which on arrival was considered satisfactory, became ?. The distribution of English or Scottish seed was then suspend-

Sale of Flaxseed (Ireland) Order, 1918. Ten towns were visited during the week and reports were furnished on the sales of 41 merchants. ? reports indicate that, generally, the oontrol prices are being observed. A certain number of merchants, however, neglected to exhibit the necessary list of seed prices, and the Department are communicating with them in the matter.

Flaxseed (Ireland) Order, 1918.

Seventeen permits were issued during the week authorising the scutching and sale of defaulters&apos; flax.

Homosaved Flaxseed.

Fourteen applications were received from farmers during the week for permits to sell homesaved flaxseed to merchants. One permit, authorising the sale of 4 bags, was issued.

During the period from 29th April to 5th May, inclusive, applications for licences were received as follows;-

To slaughter or export heifers.................215

To slaughter bulls or bullocks................. 35
