From Viceroy, Foreign Department, [Qth May 19J9. (Received 17th.)Secret. Afghanistan. Afghans are giving out to tribes that pretended negotia-tions for cessation of hostilities are device to gain time. Though some of younger Afridis are getting out of hand, Roos Keppel considers whole situation very favour-able. Police and Frontier Constabulary have done magnificently, not a single desertion. Desertions from isolated Khyber Rifles outposts have been frequent and .the Corps is being concentrated at Landi Kotal. ^
