BRITISH:.iteR0AHSE&quot;J3 LURIHE UIOTOBM Bill.Uoto by the Acting President of the Board of SJra&amp;e.In 1917, in ooneequenoe of representations made by the Associations representing Navigating and Engineer Officers of the Mercantile 0.:larine in favour of the in-stitution of a standard uniform foi the &apos;lerohant Service, Six Albert Stanley appointed a Committee representative gof those Officers, of Shipowners, of the Admiralty and the Board of Trade, to advice as to the uniform to be nadopted.      The Committee reported at the end of that year, and the Majority reooniouded that the standard uniform which had been devised shorJd be foiraially instituted but shcrud nut be made compulsory on board ship, although if it was desired to wear uniform on shore it should not be any other uniform than the sTancTard.A Minority Report by the representatives of the Liverpool Shipowners opposed the :.dca of any standard uniform at least so far as pasuengtr liners, in which they were ohiefly interested, were concerned; whilst on the other hand a Reservation was made by the repres-representatives of the If a vi gating Officers in which they ex-pressed the opinion that the Board of Trade should make the&apos; adoption of the standard uniform &quot;universal whether ashore or afloat&quot;.      Tne recommendation of the Majority Beport was therefore a-compromise between these two extremes.After the Reports were published the Offleers1 Associations pressed for something to be done to establish the standard uniform as soon as possible; and, as no opportunity arose for introducing a Bill into Parliament, a prerogative order in Council was passed in September, 1918, instituting the uniform and giving affect to the compromise recommended by the Majority Report.$his Order in Council did not include powers to exact ponalties for the wrongful use of the uniform nor did it give permanent protection to its distinguish-ing marks,      For the moment some penalties are pro-vided by the Defence of the Eeala Kegulations, but a promise was given last Session in the Houao of Commons *on behalf of the Board of Trade, that legislation would be introduced in order to put the matter on a proper footingf    I think that the accompanying short Bill will effect this purpose.to, C GEDDES.12 th May 1919.This Document is the Property, of-His Britannic JVla]esty,s Govornmei&apos;; j.-. -..:.&apos;:K--,:-:r^r*j;jSJ^u^^^^.........................--..__y.  ....   .,1^,^- * .. . . .,...........  ... .    .
