Tills Document is the Property or ^tdLutX ^LyuM his Britannie majesty^ Government /- &quot;&quot;&quot;*&quot;&quot;--1471) iWAR    CABINET.SALARIES OF SCTENTJTIC AND TECHNICAL OFFICERS IN TEE GOVERNMENT SERVICE.memorandum BY THE MINISTER OF MUNITIONS.The proposal contained in G.T. 7108 to appoint a Committee to consider the conditions of employment of Scientific and Technical Officers in the Government Service is of direct interest to the Ministry of Munitions and future Ministry of Supply.The scheme for a Government Chemical Service was &quot;brought prominently &quot;before the Ministry of Munitions by the Institute of Chemistry after the Armistice.   The Ministry had had ample opportunities during the War of estimating the value of an efficient Chemical Service and was, therefore, in general sympathy with the objects of the suggested scheme. As, however, it was uncertain to what extent the Ministry of Supply would need a Chemical Service, It was not considered to be a matter which the Min&apos;stry could independently pursue further and It was suggested to the Civil Service Commissioners that an Inter-departmental Committee should be appointed to enquire into the present conditions of employment of Chemists in Government fro par Orient geSinco then the Ministry has transferred to the War Office a number of Chemists employed in the Research Departments of the Ministry, a limited number of Chemists being retained temporarily in connection with certain Chemical Research Work.   The staff of tho Ministry includes, besides
Chemists, a large number of Technical Officers and their conditions of employment will present considerable diffi-culty when the time comes to form a permanent establish-ment for the Ministry of Supply,I agree, accordingly, that the proposed enquiry should extend to both Scientific and Technical Officers, though the terms of reference should be so drawn as to elicit separate recommendations in respect of the two classes.The Ministry should be represented on the Committee and I presume that I shall have an opportunity of seeing the proposed constitution of the Committee and Terms of Reference before a definite decision is reached,i.8th Hay, 1919.
