This Docu )v.-t - i?, tho Property ofy His Britannic n/iajesty&quot;s government war Cabinet.121/904SGeneral Act of Indemnity for ^cto done in good faith During the War and Statute of Limitations in respect of Claims arising out of the War. aMemorandum &quot;by the Undersecretary of State for War..1,     Lord Cave&apos;s Committee&quot;on the Continuance of Emergency Legislation after the termination of the War&quot; in paragraph 16 of,their first report dated 6th February last, after considering the recommendations of the War Office Emergency Legislation Committee, advised that a general Act of Indemnity was necessary for acts purporting to be done under Emergency Statutes and Regulations, and that this Act should provide that all claims arising out of., or in connection with the present war should be barred unless presented within twelve months after the termination of the war or within twelve months after the date on which such claims arose whichever is the longer period,2.     The Colonial Office have raised with the .Var Office as &apos; a separate question the necessity for validating measures taken by British Officials in connection with the administration of overseas territory taken from the enemy, and suggested that each Dominion or Colony should pass validating legislation dealing with acts done within its own territory while the Imperial Parliament should deal with acts done outside the jurisdiction^ This was referred to Parliamentary Counsel Who expressed the view that provisions validating the acts of British officials whilst in military occupation of enemy territories could properly be included in a General Act of Indemnity in respect of acts committed in the United Kingdom.3.     It is understood that no action has so far been taken on the recommendation of Lord Cave&apos;s Committee quoted in Paragraph 1, but in view of the possible early termination of tfte war it is desirable that a draft Indemnity Bin should be immediately prepared,4.     This could most quickly be done by an Interdepartmental Committee on which all Departments concerned would be represented and the meetings of which would be attended by Parliamentary Counsel, and Hr0 Churchill is of opinion that the Rt* H0nfl Visuount Peelj Under Secretary of State for War, who has recently presided over a similar committee would be a suitable chairman,5.     3y direction of the Secretary of State for War the approval of the War Cabinet is therefore asked for the appointment of an Interdepartmental Committee as described in the preceding paragraph under the Chairmanship of Lord Peelc(Sd.)-   PEEL,21/5.War Office,21st May, 1919.
