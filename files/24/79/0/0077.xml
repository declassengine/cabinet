Report on Movements and Meetings 8,5,19, of Extremists in Dublin Police Area, during month of April, 1919,I.REPORT   BY   LORD   FRENCH,Illness prevented me from furnishing my reports to the vrar Cabinet during the early months of this year,    The kaleidoscopic changes to which this country is subject ren-. dered it advisable on my return that a careful survey of events be made before reporting.In the month of January, the Sinn feiners elected to Parliament, and. who had taken an oath not to attend at &apos;&quot;est-mlnster, met in solemn conclave at the Mansion House, Dublin, to inaugurate a Parliament of their own, the &quot;Dall Fireann,&quot;Lost of the proceedings were conducted in Irish and failed to awaken any enthusiasm in the country,     Subsequent to this Meeting signs of reaction became apparent among farmers in the country who had supported Sinn Fein originally as an insurance against conscription..The best barometer in Ireland as to the popularity of a movement is the response made to appeals for subscriptions, and although pressing appeals have been issued from Sinn Fein Headquarters, the responses have been groring gradually less.Up to the election Sinn Fein vras working in complete accord with the Transport &quot;orkers Union,     After the election differences appeared to arise between Sinn Fein as a whole5 and the Transport &quot;orhera Union, reports showing that Labour had begun to doubt whether they were wise in giving their entire support to that Body,During the month of February it became apparent that Sinn Fein itself wasbrorMng into two parties,- a moderate and an extreme party.     Labour also divided, a Bolshevistic element developing, the extremes of both parties being ready to go to any length.     They have joined forces with the Irish Republican Brotherhood and the Irish Volunteers, practically affiliating themselves with the extreme Revolutionists and the Physical Force Party,
(Sgd.)   FRENCH,15th Hay 1919.That this was the opinion of some of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy can be gathered from their Lenten Pastorals in which they warned their flocks against the danger of Secret Societies and present-day Socialisms     Tho Cardinal Archbishop of Armagh advised the young men to avoid &quot;useless practices&quot;, instancing drillingremarking that &quot;They might practice the goose step to the Greek Calends and that it would never bring them one step nearer freedom^&quot;&apos;:&apos;hat I said in my report in December as to the probable necessity of drastic action becoming necessary has unfortunate-ly proved to be correct0     The Extremist elements of Sinn Fein and the Bolshevistic element of Labour are now combined and their activities have been demonstrated in several cowardly murders.     The more moderate Sinn Peiners are preparing to organise passive resistance to the Government and to clog the wheels of local administratioiioFrom several parts of the country information received shows that well-to-do farmers and others interested in the staple industries of the country are beginning to feel that their best interests are not being served by idealistic or revolutionary doctrinesoThe mischievous societies which had been allowed to grow and propper for years without any interference on the part of the Government are now,standing out in their true light, and if dealt with promptly, there is every reason to hope that the majority of the people, at present terrorised by the village bullies, will be emancipated, and confidence, a delicate plant in the Celtic constitution, will replace,the cancerous growth which, has, and is, poisoning the country*

The general state of the Country remains unsettled, met a &quot;general air &quot;of expectancy exists that the future holds prospects )f exciting events, but no one appears to -be in the position to predict fdiat shape these events will take.&apos;   This state of expectancy is attribut-ible to the metho els of t&quot;e Sinn Fein Executive, who keep their adherents&apos; nt&apos;- rest alive by premises, veiled hints, and occasional dramatic acts, he present policy of Sinn Fein appears to be a &quot;see-saw&quot; one, that is, arrying out some project to counterbalance the efforts of the Government n repression of violence and crime.   For example, the abortive strike in imerick was a serious blow to Sinn Fein, and as a result rumours were ieard that Sinn Fein was doing the country no good.     To counterbalance ,his defeat&apos; great efforts are now being -ade to make the visit of the merican Delegates a big national affair and thus create enthusiasm among ,ne populace.The work of the Irish Volunteers is being carried on as keenly as jver, although it is done secretly and traces of it are difficult to find. !he explosion at Cork, however, shows that this work is always going on nder the surface, and also that the Irish Volunteers themselves show inch ingenuity, skill and military knowledge in the manufacture of mili-lary weapons * IIn consequence of this aggressive spirit now existing in the Irish lolunteers, raids for arms and such like outrages must be looked for **One point may be worthy of attention.   From careful reading of the iifferent copies of the AN T J0GLAC (the official secret Irish Volunteer Irgan) it would appear that the Irish Volunteer Headquarters so con-ftantly speak of the necessity for courage and initiative that they real-[se that their units are only ill-trained troops.    In consequence should Ihey in any raid receive a serious set-back the -enthusiasm for this form If violence would quickly evaporate0During the period under review there have been ten hostile raids for jrms, and military aid has been given to the police on S4 occasions,UARDS^    A further reduction in the number of troops employed on Railway efelice, referred to in para, 6. of my letter of. 1st April, lias been ffected by the withdrawal of the guards on the Bridges at Portarlingtonj allinasloe, and.

1.6.1REPORT BY aSPECTO?,. ^M?AT^RQYAt IRISH COKSTABU^AKY,,, , FOiy^CTOF /PRIL. 1919,LJL. UNDER SECRETARY.&apos;$URAL I have to report that the condition of the provincesDITION remained unsatisfactory during the Month of April gwj agTHE to the prevalence of political discontent,   otherwise t,nNTRY. -the whole it was fairly tranquil.Trade was good;, hut the continuance of War prices for all articles of commerce was severely felt by the poor and persons living on limited incomes.Agriculture appears likely to be affected by the constant demands for higher wages,, as with a view to reducing their staff of labourers,farmers propose to do less tillage in future,No new industries were reported.   Labour organisa-tion was carried on through branches cf the Irish Trans-pert &amp; General Workers Union all over the country,  and Unrest among the working classes was very general.Numerous strikes occurred.   Many of them were cf short duration and terminated to the advantage cf the workers.Farmers, who as a rule are small employers,  are co-operating to resist the demands of labourers for 4o/-to 5c/- a week, and they refused to pay a higher rate than that fixed by the Wages Beard under the Corn production Act.The labourers, partly because their newly formed Unions are not yet rich enough to finance extensile strikes, and partly, perhaps, because they knew that their demands are excessive, resumed work in considera-ble numbers, without any increase.The principal strike occurred at Limerick, but its origin was political rather than industrial.   In consequence of the murderous attack publicly made on police at the Workhouse Hospital on April 6th, when one Constable was shot dead and another seriously wounded the City of Limerick was proclaimed a ,Special Military Area and it became necessary for the men employed at Clee-;e;3 Factory outside the boundary to obtain permits to go to their work.   Many of these being Sinn Feiners refused to apply for permits and decided to call a general strike as a protest against the military restrictions..   They were supported by the Irish Transport and General Workers Union whose organisers are chiefly Sinn&apos;Feiners.   Strike pickets ordered shop-keepers to close which they did, and all work and business was suspended except at the Railway, Banks, and Government offices.   At the end of a fortnight, however, disappointed in its expectation of outside support, and having failed to effect the with-drawal of the military restrictions, the strike collapsed and on April 23th. business was fully resumed in the City,The failure of this strike is believed to have damaged the prestige of Sinn Fein with the workers who, it is alleged, have only been paid 5/- per man for the 2 wrecks.   The Railway Union would not allow its members
to join.   The independent Labour Party sent their sympathy, hut no financial assistance.The industrial disputes were on the whole peaceably conducted, but in connection with the strike of the Dublin County Council&apos;s roadmen, four attempts were made irf different places to blow up road culverts.There was as usual agraiian agitation for the division of grazing lands into economic holdings in Oonnaught and Munster - particularly in the Counties of Galway and Clare where, owing to intimidation a large number of persons are under police protection; and similar friction, but of a more isolated character, was also reported in parts of Kilkenny, Louth, Queen&apos;1 s County, Westmeath and Monaghan.Relations between landlord and tenant, however, continued fairly good.   The ordinary crime of the country presented no abnormal features during the Month but the following particulars of exceptional offences will be of interest :-Go. Donegal.   At 3.30 p-.m. on 5th April a crowd of 40to 50 labourers on strike came to the field in which Geo-v peoples, farmer, and his two labourers were at work.   They endeavoured to persuade tite labourers to join them, and failing in this&quot; they stoned them and compelled them to leave the field. Peoples then procured a gun from a neigh-bour about 100 yards away, returned to a distance of 22 y&amp; &amp;s from the crowd and then fired a shot straight into them $wounding four men very slightly in the faces and necks,   peoples arrested; infor-mation.  refueled by the local Justices.     (CO. Down;        At 5.30 P-m, 6n 4th April a party of about16 labourers on strike entered the lands of William Matier, farmer, where he was working with 2 labourers (non-union men) . Matier had a double-barrelled gun and ordered them off.   They went and he followed and fired a shot at them from a distance 6f about 4c yards wounding two very slightly. Matier asserts he fired at the ground to -frighten them.   He has been arrested.Co. Clare.      )ft 10 p.m&apos;. on 5th April two gun shots werefired outside the house of David Kynne, farmer, Ennietymon district, and one shot fired through kitchen window breaking glas3. Jfo other injury; family were in bed.   There is a family dispute over land going on petween a Mrs. Bgt. Flaherty and her step-daughter,   hrs. ifynne is a cousin of the former and on friendly terms with her.Co* Limerick. At 1 a.ra. on 4th inst. several disguisedmen broke into the house of :irs. Anna Carter, R&amp;thkeale Sub-dist., by bursting open ,the front door.   On entering they fired two shots and then forced the door of the bed-room in which Mrs. Carter and her son were sleeping.   They were pulled out of bed and made to go on their knee3 and swear to give up 4 acres of land to Mrs. Carter&apos;s nephews. The party then left the house firing several shots when they got outside.
Thomas and Daniel Nolan arrested.   Their father Thos. Nolan senr. claims this land but Thomas carter, Mrs. Parter1s s^n, took pro-ceedings at quarter Sessions on 7th April and established his mother&apos;s title.Accused on remand.On the night of the 25th April the house of Mr, Fitzgerald, Killarncy district, was entered by 5 masked men, one of whom carried a revolver.   Fitzgerald was about going to bed when he heard a knock at the door.   On opening the hall door a man.outside placed his foot between tho jamb and the door to pre-vent it being closed, and all then entered. The man with the revolver presented it at Fitzgerald and asked him had he any arms,, and he replied not.   The party then searched the house and took away two shot guns, one miniature riile,  one revolver, and about ICO rounds of ammunition; also two valuable gold watches. s&apos;-uie other articles of jewellery, and two  1 Treasury notes.Mr. Fitzgerald had a permit for one shot gun, and tho polioe were not aware that he had any other arms.The District Inspector is of opinion that the object of this raid was more to secure money and valuables than arms.On 21st April at 8,30 p.m., Mr, Quirm, J\P. and his herd Tho3&apos;. Deveny, y/ere fired at from behind a wall on the roadside at Corker in the Gort dist. and both were wounded.   Mr. Quinn had recently taken 27 acres of grazing land from Lady Gregory which the local people want for themselves.On Sunday morning, 2oth April,  the police barrack at Araglen, Feraoy district, was raided by 10 or 12 men armed and disguised, while all the party, except the Barrack Orderly, were at Mass.   The Barrack Orderly was over-powered and bound, and put in the lock-up whilst the raiders made off with the arms and ammunition, some accoutrements, and station rec ords.On the night of 8th April, a police patrol of 4 men was ambushed near Eyries.   Three shots were fired wounding 3 of the patrol. The police returned the fire but could not see the position of their assailants in the dark,Five osfctle belonging to Lord Kenmare were maliciously poisoned at Killarney.   Motive suggested - Lord Kenmare had lately opened a butcher&apos;s shop and was underselling the local butchers.    250 compensation claimed.On Sunday, April 6th, at the Workhouse Hospital. Limerick, a Prison warder and 5 armed police guarding a Sinn Fein prisoner, Robt. i&apos;yrne, were suddenly attacked by about 30 men who had entered under the pretence of visiting patients.   Three of the police were overpowered before they could use their arms, the remainder made a hard fight until one was shot dead and the other seriously wounded by a revolver bullet.   The prisoner Byrne was
CO. Cork. W.R.Cs* Longford,On night of 12/I3th April two boycotting notices warning people against supplying police at Inchigeela (Macroom diet;) with bog for turf cutting were posted up in village of Inchige&amp;la.On April 27th 2 Constables returning from duty at Drumli3h were attacked by 6 men who shouted &quot;Hand up your arms in the name of the Irish Republic&apos;1.   The Constables fired and their assailants fled leading one of their party at the scene wounded.Qoi Clare. Cn April 13th 4 miles from Kilrush a Sinn Feindrilling party attacked 2 Constables and took away their rifles.   On the sergeant coming up and using his revolver the police recovered their rifles, routed the Sinn Feinars and took 6 prisoners whom they marched to Kilrush  arracksIn addition to the foregoing there were agrarian cases of oat tie-driving for which a number of offenders have been made amenable by the police.Illicit distillation is also reported to be on the increase together with the vicious practice of other and methylated spirits drinking as a result of -the exhorbitant price of whiskey,I regret to be unable to report any improvement in the general attitude of hostility towards the police.In consequence of the murder of a Resident Magistrate, and a constable, and attempts to murder other members: of the Con-stabulary, the Commandor-in-Ghief declared the town of westport and its vicinity, and the City pf Limerick, to be Special Military Areas,  and in the special Military Area of West Cork, at. lyries, Castletownbere, and Ardgroora, publie houses were ordered to be closed and the holding of fairs and marketw Was prohibited.also shot, &quot;but the raiders got him away to a house in the locality where he was subsequently found dead by the police.Co.

part II.The Unionist, and the Constitutional Nationalist Societies were inactive during the Hc-nth.On the contrary the  inn Fein revolutionary organiza-tion, comprising Sinn tfein Clubs and the Irish Volu&amp;eoers, displayed unabated energy.Numerous public meetings, concerts, lectures, tfaelio Felfl, and,similar entertainments were held all ever the Provine03 with a view to maintaining life and vigour in the movement,,   The meetings were not remarkable for unuBiall^/iolent language; but the&apos; speakers invariably attacked the R.I.C. in pursuance, of the conspiracy to undermine and corrupt the loyalty of that Force,     The principal offenders being Counters karkievica, Mr, (tinnell, Mr0 0*Keeffe, Mr, Etchiugiiam - all immoers of Parliament, and one or two priors *Reports of their speeches of which the following is a sample were -submitted for consideration.On April  Oth at Nohoval Daly, Co, Cork, Mr. CKnaffa said - &quot;I have a ne-iaful duty to perform in connexion v,it.h our black army, i,e. the IVLLoe,   Make no mistake abouf- xt, but for that .y.rm7 ?&apos;e would have one freedom now*     They are decent fathers&apos; aud mothers1 30:1s but, the moment they go inside the gate of that Depot in Dublin they are oompl.sta.Ly changedx uHe asked parents who had sons in the police to write to them and ask them for Qadbs sake to come home, saying that they would get plenty of employment from the County Council3U     &apos;TOne word more, if chose men salute you don:t spoalt to them.-,11During the past week typed circulars from the HeadQuarters of the Comman-na-M&apos;; a:.i (Women1 s Branch of Sinn Fein) forbidding me j) ours of the Society to hold any oon-versation, or even to sit in oho same pew in Church., vdth a policemanj were distributed through the post.This organised hostility to the Constabulary, besides endangering their 11&apos;70s.: -renders the ordinary duty of criminal investigation /increasingly difficult, and is part of the scheme for &quot;making British Government in Ireland . impossible;,71The concerts and.kindred entertainments serve the dual purpose of promoting disaffection and collecting funds for Sinn Fein, .Some of these gatherings which j?ere manifestly sedition .were prohibited by the Competent military Authority under D.R:. Regulation 9 A., T.i3, at Ma&apos;Lin Head, Co, Donegal; Carrickmaeross, Co,&apos; Konaghau; Gore abridge, Co. Kilkenny.; Dunshaughlin, Go, Meath; BanAon, Co^ Cork; Drumcollolie?;-, Co, limerick; and at V;aterford0Seven new Sinn Fein Clubs were formed during the Month., bringing the total number in the Provinces up to 1,396, with an approximate membership of 116.850.Though a few cases of drilling were detected here and there, for which the ringleaders were made amenable, there was no general attempt by the.Irish Volunteers to openly resume military exercises.TheJfclCid, IVITY,
The police, however, in-.the course of searches 9pparms continued to find documentary evidence ah owing, that   600 secret organization was actively going on.   A bomb, three others in course of construction, together with materials for manufacturing bomb a, etc were found in the house of an Irish Volunteer officer at Ballincollig, Go. Cork, on  3rd April, and on April 28th an explosion at a house in Cork City in which 5 persona were injured, led to tfie discovery of a largo number of hand grenades, bombs,, and other explosives concealed under tho basement floor.Several persons have boon arrested in connexion with these searches either for trial by Court kartial or to be bound to the peaooj in the latter cases the offenders invariably declined to give the necessary bail and submitted to the alternative of imprisonment,Dail is ire aim commenced its second sitting on April 1st at the Mansion House, Dublin,   Thirty-seven Ll,PTs attended but the proceedings which lasted 3 days were private.At a public Session on 11th Mr, de Valera delivered his presidential addresb, a resolution demanding self-determina-tion for Ireland was passed, etc, but no administrative action was attempted.     The second ocst,ion of this hepublican Assembly did not attract much attention in the Provinces.Judged by outward manifestations, the Sinn itein MKna&amp;nt did not appear to be making progress.     The attendance at-public meetings was often disappointing,, and the indoor functions were not always well supported.The Anti-Conscript ion .::Und has now been wound up, and although reliable information as to its disposal is not yet available, it Is known that a large number of the subscribers accepted the return of their money and did not hand it over to the Dail Eriearm   iftuid as requested.Pew attempts were made to commemorate the anniversay of tho 1916 rebellion.In fact,1 little if any change was noticeable in the political state of the country during April,     Discontent with the existing form of government prevailed in all Nationalist circles.The Republican extremists who advocate physical force as the ultimate remedy devoted their energies to Irish Volunteer organization.The more moderate and larger section were hopeful of achieving the desired object through propaganda and the pressure of American opinion through I:resident Wilson and within the past- few days they have received encouragement from the visit of Messrs. Walsh, Byan, and Dunne, Irish-American delegates to the j.eace Conference.According to a reliable informant in the event of his expectations being unsatisfied, Mr&quot;, de Valera proposes in co-operation with .*abour, and supported by the Irish Volunteers, to organize the utmost passive resistance to British Government including taxation. .In such eventuality unless overawed by powerful military force the extremists would probably rise in revolt, or at least launch a campaign of assassination and outrage.An informant reports that it Is stated in the inner oircle of Sinn Fein that &quot;the Irish-American delegates have given the Dail Sireann executive to understand that the Prime Minister was very anxious to effect peace in Ireland, and has through someone named Wiseman expressed a wish that
the delegateb should bring back a proposrunderstanding as to the terms that would be accepted in Ireland, and the lines laid down are complete freedom of action in all home affairs laws and the passing and altering of same, and a large sum of money to start working1 the country on.&quot;Informant further rev-orbs - &quot;Dunne (delegate) said that he ^as asked in larie by his ov;n Government rexresenta-tives would it not satisfy the Irish to mi-ike Ireland a federal state under an alliance v-ith the allied Governments,&quot;In I.R.B. Oircles this is all regarded as twaddle, and the way they view things is that the end of all talk means a fight.&quot;(od. ) J. BYRlffi.Inspector General*

Mr*.De Valera and many of the prom-inent Sinn Fein leaders were among the spectators.The Ard Fhels of Sinn Fein was held in the&apos; Mansion House&apos; on Tuesday 8th and Wednesday 9th ult.   About 350 persons were in attendance:   Speeches, were delivered by Rev. M.0&apos;Flanagan, E..De Valera Countess Markievicz. and others.Sinn Feiners raided the house of Detective Sergeant Hally, Norfolk Road, on night of 9th ult,     The Sergeant, who came en the scene while the. raid was in&apos;progress fired from his revolver on those on guard outside, one of whom is believed to have been wounded?   No arms were found and no arrests made as those taking part decamped before the Police, arrived.About the same time another Detective, while in the act of entering his residence in Glengariff Parade, was set upon by a party of five men who&apos; bound his hands- and feet, s-arched him and then made off.   The Detective had no revolver or documents in his possession, and no attemptswas made by his assailants to enter his house.The Offices of the Sinn Fein Volunteers and Cumann na mBan, 44 Rutland Square, were searched by Detectives on 12th April, but nothing of importance was found. -&apos;&quot;.&apos;At the Annual Congress of the G.A.A. held in the Mansion House on 20th April, Alderman Nowlan presiding, it was decided that all&apos; Civil Servants who took the Oath of Allegiance should be excluded&apos; from the Association..The Republican leaders are still placing their main hope in the Peace Conference and efforts are,, it Is -said, being -;a.de by them to induce Dr. McCartan to join the Sinn Fein representatives, John T. Kelly and G.0avan Duffy,&apos; in Paris.     This, they think, would help the American Delegates in obtaining a hearing before the Conference -closes of Irelandfe case,Sinn Fein Clubs still stand at.26 with an approximate membership of 5,100. &apos;&quot; .No Arms have,., as far as the Police are aware, been unlawfully landed in Dublin,, nor has any illegal drilling come under notice1 1REPORT ON MOVEMENTS&quot;AND MEETINGS OF EXTREMISTS IN THE DUBLIN POLICE.
