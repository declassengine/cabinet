No.22-for week ended 17th May 1919.BALTIC.On the morning of 13th May H.M.S. &quot;CURACOA&quot; while on passage from LIBAU to REVAL was mined in a position In Lat. 590 18* N.i Long 220 48!E.     She was able to reach REVAL, and R.A., then transferred his flag to &quot;CLEOPATRA&quot;*     &quot;CURACOA&quot; was escorted back to Copenhagen by &quot;VANESSA&quot; and &quot;SEPOY&quot; and will return to Chatham for repairs, escorted by &quot;SEAPIRE&quot; and &quot;SEPOY&quot;     H.M.S.. &quot;GALATEA&quot; will relievs &quot;CURACOA&quot; in the Baltic.The Paddle Minesweepers &quot;BAHBURY&quot; , &quot;HEXHAM&quot;, and   ;&apos; &quot;LANARK11 are being despatched to the Baltic from Dover, calling at Copenhagen en route.    Senior Naval Officer, Baltic, has been informed that these ships arc manned by crews which have signed on for mine4clearance only, and that they are not to bo used in any operations in which they might come under fire.&apos;Senior Naval Officer, Baltic, having asked for two more destroyers, &quot;VIVACIOUS&quot;,, &quot;VOYAGER&quot;, &quot;VANCOUVER&quot;, and &quot;Waterhen&quot; left Rosyth on 15th, and arrived at Copenhagen on 17th May.   &quot;SEAFIRE&quot; and &quot;SEPOY&quot; return to U.K. with &quot;CURACOA&quot;.    Ih view of the fact that there will be 13 destroyers In Baltic waters, the depot ship &quot;GREENWICH&quot; is to proceed to Copenhagen, leaving Rosyth about 19th*H.M.S-. &quot;LUCIA&quot;, with Submarines L.12, L.16,L.55, E.27 and E.40 and T.B.D &quot;WRYNECK&quot; have sailed for Libau* Submarine L-.ll Will follow on 26th May. Owing to the danger from mines in the Gulf of Finlandj    Submarines, are not to be used on patrol for watching the Bolshevik bases, but it is considered that their presence at RevaL, if well advertised, will keep the Bolshevik heavy ships in harbour.A military Mission, with General Sir Hubert Gough at its head, is to leave for Helsingfors on 19th May.   Captain Bruton, R.N.., is a member of the Mission and on arrival in Finland he will relieve Acting Captain GRENFELL, now Naval Attache at Helsingfors.Two Russian Naval Petty Officer prisoners, RASKOLNIKOFF and NINUIR, arc to be exchanged for one British Naval Officer, 3 ratings, and certain Military Ranks.     They will take passage to Copenhagen in &quot;GREENWICH&quot;,, and will there be met by a representative from the British Embassy, accompanied by representatives of the Danish Red Cross..Latvla-*There appears to be no material change in the situation in Latvia.    The Americans announced their intention of landing and distributing flour, irrespective of the political situation and the fact that Allied orders regarding the restoration of the Lettish Government and removal of restrictions on recruiting were still disregarded.    It has now been agreed that a certain quantity of foodstuffs should be distributed to the local population and that the result should be reported.    The German Government has recalled Von der Goltzand
3 3 2- 1 2! *&quot;and Bur chard, German Minister., to Berlin to explain the circumstances of the recent coup dTetat &quot;but they refuse to change the name of the Army of occupation to German Auxiliary Force.EsthoniaeDuring the week the Bolshevik destroyers and 4 smaller craft came out to attack Esthonian ships and. to support their right flank.    They were engaged by H.M..S. &quot;CLEOPATRA&quot;, &quot;SHAKESPEARE&quot;, SCOUT&quot; and &quot;WALKER   and wore driven back behind their minefields, the chase lasting 45 minutes. Bolshevik destroyers were hit but escaped the forts covering their retreat apparently with 12:l guns.   The Bolshevik fire was ineffective and the forts used kite balloons.   Thero were no British casualties.NORTHERN   RUSSIA.The Northern Dwina is now quite ice free, but the shores of the White Sea are still unapproachable,ships^however,, are coming through the entrance without difficulty.   The enen$ have laid mines above Troitsa and paddle minesweepers have been sent up the river.   Our river flotilla and monitors are proving an effective check to all operations by the Bolshevik river forces.    Aerial reconnaissance sighted 42 enemy craft off Seltso.-  E.M.S. &quot;GLOWWORM&quot; and &quot;Cicala&quot; on 7th May bombarded Kitsa and Ignatovakaya and fires were noticed in Kitsa.,MEDITERRANEAN AND ADRIATIC&quot;AJAX&quot; with reliefs for the Mediterranean, will leave England on May 31st, and will bo followed in a few weeks by other ships carrying reliefs.    The numbers to be relieved are uncertain, but are.probably about 6^000oIt is proposed that the base at GENOA shall be closed down at the end of this month after the shipping of military stores is completed.    VENICE is to &quot;be closed about two weeks later, TRIESTE and FIUME being retained for the tii^e being.The Ottoman Government has been informed that the Forts at SMYRNA are, in view of the situation in that neighbourhood to be handed over to detachments of Allied Forces, in accordance with the terms of the Armistice.    The combined naval forces off Smyrna are under the command of the British Commander in Chief.     Greek troops disembarked on the morning of the 15th and later a serious collision took place between Greek and Turkish troops and armed civilians, and 300 Turks of whom many were wounded, were taken prisoners.On the 14th liay 500. Italians landed at EPHESUS. They are installed in the Town, and:in detachments on either side of the Town; and hutments are being erected on the shore. 100 Italians also landed at both BUDRUk and KAKRI.     The Italian Occupation may be said to extend * B8Bralong the coast from EPLESUS to ADALIA, and as far as KONIA in the Interior. It is reported from a Greek source that throughout this region, anti-Italian manifestations continue.Demonstrations occurrod in VILLA NOVA, RHODES on Easter Sunday, during the course of which a Greek Priest and his niece were Bayonetted by soldiers and killed.   About a hundred Greeks were imprisoned for    political offences.   The Italians appear to be conducting a vigorous anti-Greek campaign, nogreek
9 fil *)Greek &quot;being allowed to cross between the Islands and the Coast.BLACK   SEA.The Greek Minister has been informed that military occupation of TREBIZOND cannot be contemplated, and that consequently the safety of refugees cannot be guaranteedjThe news that the British troops at BATOUM are being relieved by the Italians, has caused a profound impression, the measure being condemned, on the ground that the Italians have no authority over foreign peoples.   It is feared that the poople, being of socialistic tendencies, will soon come under the influence of the Bolsheviks, who are very active throughout the CAUCASUS.    An Italian Mission has left TARANTO on s.s0 &quot;lembi&quot; far GEORGIA.   It is thought that when this Mission report on the difficulties etc., which will confront ITALY, she will endeavour to relinquish her Mandate for tnis region*There is still pressure by the Bolsheviks against the Kertch peninsula.   They broke through on the Azov side, but the Volunteer Army, assisted by the fire of British warships have since restored the position.    All the Russian volunteer troops, with the exception of the sick and wounded have now been transported from Constantza and Galatz.In the Sea ofAzov, British T.B.D&apos;s have been ordered to destroy all vessels transporting Bolshevik troops and those were,capable of being used for this purpose.    H.M.SS &quot;Parthianu&amp;&quot;Forester, fired on at Ghenichesk, both vessels being hit, but their seaworthiness was unaffected and there were no casualties.   They are completing the destruction of the shipping outside the range of shore batteries.CASPIAN.The evacuation commences on June 15th, and will occupy eight weeks.   The R.A.P., working under the Navy, will, be evacuated about the middle of July, and the Naval Brigade about the third week of July.The Rear Admiral, Black Sea, states that it would be disastrous to turn over the shipping in the Caspian to Denikin, owing to difficulty in manning and the small reliability to be placed in the personnel available.   Moreover, workmen at Baku will not work for him.   The situation might be modified if Kolchak can reach the Volga and so cut off the Bolshevik Pleet at Astrakhan.Successful air raids were carried out by the British over Astrakhan on May 10th. Hits were obtained, on the shipping and fires were observed.News has been received that the Polsheviks intend to mine the Volga between Schilovka - Simbirsk - Plianovka.ALLIED NAVAL ARMISTICE COMMISSION.SubmarinesIt has been reported that the Submarine Pressure dock which broke adrift on April 29th when on passage to Harwich has now been taken to YiiUIDEN by Dutch tugs.   Admiral Goette has asked theDutch... * *.

No reply to this protest has been forwarded.Mineaweoping.Admiral Goette has been informed that the dates when British Mines were laid cannot bo communicated and that in the case of minefields where mines are fitted with sinking device or delay release device, no guarantee cyan be given that these devices have operated in all cases and that such minefields should be fully swept 8ver, and further that mines sunk on the bottom cannot be guaranteed safe and should not be so regarded until the bottom has been twice swept over.German Mercantile Marine.12 additional German Ships have been handed over during the week, and the numbers that have now been delivered up are:-Por British.......   132   out of   251*French..&apos;...... .51 98U.S.A.........     11 61********** &apos;*i ********174 410.The above list includes ships which arc in Neutral Ports which were not included in previous returns-.No reply has yet been received to the message from the 1st Sea Lord to Admiral Goette on the 9th instant re the surrender to the French of the German Ships in Spain.The Armistice Shipping Commission, Rotterdam, has been dealing with this question with special reference to disposal of cargoes but no absolute decision appears to have been reached-. ..Blockade.The absolute prohibition upon the export from Germany of gold, silver-, securities and material of war without special consent of the Associated Governments Is being rigorously maintained, but as regards other exports including goods on the pre-emption list, applications to the I.A.T.C!s or other blockade authorities for permission to export are for the present regarded as unnecessary.The political situation at Libau is unchanged.Germany has asked to be allowed to trade with Esthonia as with the Northern Neutrals.    No reply has yet been sent to this request, but A.N.A.Q., proposes to refuse it unless Paris have reasons for the contrary-.      Senior Naval Officer^, Baltic, has been informed that during the blockadeno more
*S    f&quot;*) 0 3nor moro ships should be allowed to sail with cargoes for LIBAU.Naval Inter-Allied Commissions of Controls \It has been decided that the Commission to deal with the Naval Clauses of the Peace Terms with Austria shall as in the case of the Armistice,, be completely independent of the Commission which will deal with the Terms with Germany&apos;.
