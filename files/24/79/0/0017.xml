Threatened on the one side by Admiral lolchak and on the othor by Finland,   the Soviet Government may fall at any moment. The oollapse of   the Communists at Munich, after the murder of their hostages,&apos;soems to have had a profound effect upon tho neighbouring countries,   ana the momory of tho stern punishment inflicted upon the Communist leaders is not likely to be forgotten immediately.    In Hungary it is unlikely that Bela ICun can long maintain his position. The situation is less favourable in the Baltic States and in South Russia.May Bay, which was   celebrated with disorderly demonstrations in Paris and Madrid,-appears  to have passed off   oitiotly elsewhere.    In Italy the outburst of patriotic feeling over tho STumo question has united all parties for the moment.    In Switzerland no Communist rising is anticipated, while in Holland, where the outlook is loss favourable,I the forces   of law and order   appear to bo fully prepared for events.I In Roumania Bolshevism is said to be making no progress, and in Vienna the situation is reported to   be easier.Though it is difficult to obtain from&apos;the conflicting reports a I clear view of what is happening in Germany, thero seems to be no I immediate danger of  a   fresh series of Spartacist outbreaks.    Of1Allied/
Allied countries, France, for the moment, seems to &quot;be the least stable.Jhe article in the &quot;Times&quot;of. the 6th on the subject of extensive   forgeries of  Allied Currency Hotea should &quot;be accepted with great reserve.    I have &quot;before mo, specimens of a  pre-Revolution Note and.a   SO Boublo Bolshevik Note.    The   latter is very &quot;badly printed on inferior paper, end the Office that produced it would be   quite incapable of producing plausible forgeries of French or English Notes.    Moreover, no such forgories have been traced in England up to dato.    There is now  reason for belief that the story of these forsorles originates with Russian Reactionaries in  inland end Scandinavia who are anxious to keep alive in tho Allied   countries a   sense of tho dancer of Bolshevism to their pockets.
The May Day demonstrations in Paris led to serious disturbances.    The French Government have for   some time kept in barracks troops who can be absolutely relied upon, and   they also felt sure of   the Police, but tho Demonstration was very badly handled by the latter who, of course, being for the most part soldiers fresh from the Colours, have no experience in managing disorderly crowds.    ProbaYiy, if the crowd had been left a   way of   escape when it was decided to break up the procession, there would   have been very few casualties.    As   it   was, the  number of  Police   injured was abnormally high.In spite   of   the   circular from the Minister of Public Works, published on April 27th, in which the disastrous effect of a   strike   on lfc,y Day was explained to tho railwayman, the strike was   carried out not   only on the railways, but also In other industries.    Tho organization of the  strikes was faultless, and it was   clear that the leaders had a strong hold on the mon.    According   to a   fe.tf.es Union poster, the objects of the   strike   were the eight hours1 day, amnesty for all prisoners, speeding   up of. demobilisation, a just peace and disarmament,   withdrawal of  troops from Bwssia, abolition of the   tax on wages, Martial   law,   K.nd the Censorship.There is a persistent belief among working men thr.t further strikes may be expected daring the month.     The Syndicalist movement is growing all over Prance, and the labour leaders appear to have a quiet confidence.On the other hand, were it not for   stagnation in trade and   the delays of   the Peace Conference, France would be a poor soil for Bolshevik propaganda, and it is a fact that the growing hope that Monsieur Clemenceauls Government is to be short-lived has damped down Bolshevism.The militant section of   the -Socialist Party in Iyons is
-2&quot; 44suffering from lack of   funds, which indicates that it is not reoeiving financial assistance from enemy sources.There is discontent among the $ranch troops on the question of  Military intervention in Russia and Poland.    The method of   raising volunteers has given rise to a   rumour in Paris that if sufficient numbers of  men are not forthcoming, the younger men will be forced to go.    There is also much confusion and   delay in settling gratuities and War bonus.The Italian crisis has had a curious result.    The irritation against President Wilson has improved the relations between the I!&apos;french and Italians, for  whom much public sympathy is   felt.     Monsieur Clemenceau has certainly lost ground very much, and   there is criticism of  Mr. Lloyd Georgere attitude in supporting President Wilson.    It ia believed by the French public that America is playing a  double   game in trying to* resume relations with Germany and profit by the confusion in Europe to gain commercial supremacy.The 3?ronch Socialist Press condemns British policy in India and Egypt, on the ground that it is in direct opposition to  Wilson1s fourteen points.    Tho moderate tone at the Nations.. Socialist Oongross in Paris v/as a great disappointment to the extremists at .&quot;tyons.    The Revolutionary Party was outvoted and has abandoned the Union gacrje.    It is characteristic at these meetings that the leader should fall out.     Longuet and Ronaudel  $ad a disputo, and Jouhaux has resigned his seat in &apos;      the   Poace Conference   as a protest against the action of tho Government.BELGIUM.The general   situation in Belgium is not satisfactory. Owing to the high rate of exchange and the demand that importers   from England must deposit 50 per cent in cash before an order   is   executed.    Industrial reconstruction is at a standstill, and there is consequently much Tsnemployr^mt,- There/
- z -There seems to he a general opinion that England end ,.imerica are to blame for delaying the Peace,   by opposing the just claims of  franco   and  Belgium.    Hovertheless, thore does not appear to bo any organised attempt to spread Bolshevik propaganda among tho working classes..  Tho invitation of   the Government for persons to ccme forward and  inform against revolutionaries and enomy traders during the period of  the occupation has been received with consternation by the working&apos; classes, many of whom have been trading with the Crermans.If any disturbances   do take place in Belgium during the near future, they will not be Bolshevik, but political.    The flemish question is bound to come to a  head with the next Election.    If the Catholio Flemish Party comes into power, the Walloons will be bitterly disappointed, and rioting in the Oharleroi district may be   expected,    If, on the other hand, the Domocrats obtain a majority, as is   expected, they will introduce legislation against the Flemings end the Catholics.Further Bolshevik disturbances are unlikely.    $either the public nor tho ^-rmy are in favour of anything but constitutional methods   of   redressing- their grievances.    The mountaineer peasant has a horror of Bolshevism, and mountain troops oan be relied on by the Government.    Though there has been en increase of Bolshovik propaganda, the result appears to be negative   if one may judge from the recent elections of Municipal Councillors 0&apos;::&apos;   Zurich and Chaux-de-Oonds.     In both cases the extremists were    defeated.*Platten was arrested with Aselrod, in Finland, and according to the latest reports, he is detained in a Finnish prison.     It will be remembered that he was sentenced in Switzerland,   in his absence, to six months1 imprisonment for
the part he tool: in the disturbances of  Norombcr 11th, but it doos not appear that the Swiss Government intends to ask for his extradition.     It is probable   that he will be deprived of his Swiss nationality.The Swiss Police have recently seized a Bolshevik tract believed to have boon written by 8eidel, a   National Councillor of Zurich.The Swiss Government has officially roco^nised the German Government, with the  reservation that if:,Germany sets up a Soviet Ropublio, diplomatic relations between the two Grovornmonts will be broken off.Tho failure of the   Communists in Bavaria to keep theirMrposition has re-acted upon Saxony and Gorman Austria, both of which woro  reported to bo on the brink of Bolshevik risings. Thore seems to be no doubt that the Communists have again miscalculated the time:   their fall is due mainly to tho apathy of the country districts and the bolief that the Entente were about to stop   in.    In industrial and financial circles in Gor many, the belief prevails th-t the Government could crush Spartacirmi if they would, but they find it a useful weapon against the Entente.    This nay have been the case some weeks ago, but there seems no doubt at tho moment that the Government is roally anxious about the outlook.    In an inter-view with a German newspaper Hosts is reported as saying that the Bolshevik menace In Germany has &quot;been overcome and that the riots   in Munich woro its death struggle;   he also said that a Monarchist   rising was   out of the question.    Placards are being exhibited in Berlin depicting   Bolshevism as ft hugh black monster:   there is a general feeling that if the people had plonty of  food rjad work the Bolshevik tendencies would disappoar.On the other hand, thero is covert talk of a   MilitaryDictatorship.    Von Lettow   is suggested   as a candidate, owingto/
m      ^     mto his great popularity v&amp;th the soldiers and the Bourgeois. The general economic situation in Germany is apparently becoming worse and many factories have had to shut down for went of   coal.Owing to the recent arrests the Spartacist organisations in  Dusseldorf and Cologne,   for spreading Bolshevik propaganda amongst the troops of occupation, appears to have been temporarily broken up, AUSTRIA,Bolshevism in Austria is confined almost entirely to largo towns since the greater part of the country is icccupied by land   owning peasants, who are consequently conservative end anti-socialist.    There are very few big land-owners, Tho Tioft &apos;;ing of   the Social Democratic ?-rty is gaining ground, but the Right is moving with the Tie ft in order to avoid a   split,     Tho general situation seems to be improving, and   if Bela Eun&apos;s administration falls, the Communists will feel the blow   severely.According   to the views of the Vienna Police, the Communist movement in Corman-Austria has been considerably helped by the Russian Relief Commission in Vienna, though it has no Russian loaders.Tho Communist section of the Volkswehr is divided and acts independently in the various towns.There   appear to be no official relations between the Communists   of  Austria  and Hungary, bat the latter are in touch with the Hungarian legation at Vienna and have made repeated efforts to undermine the loyalty of the Volkswehr,A suggestion has been made that the position of the Government would   be considerably strengthened if Entente troops were sent to occupy Vienna either under the pretest of ensuring a plebescite on tho subjoct of   union between germany/
- 6 - 4gGermany and  Austria or of  protecting food trains in the event of   disorder.&apos; The announcement made by the entente that the food supply would   bo out   off if disorders take place has been very effoctive. HUNGARY.Though Bela Kun^ Government is still in existence, it is clear   that it must fall within the next few days.Tho administration of  Bela Kun has not been stained with tho   excesses of the Bolsheviks in Russia, but there have been a great many arrests and some executions of the Bourgeoisie, whom Bela Eun was powerless to save from the savagery of  the   extreme Bolshevik elements.    The German-..iustrians were apprehensive that Bela KanTs Government would seize the Gormen-Austrian property in their territory as a reprisal   for what was expected  from the Government in Belgrade.    ^or   some timo it has been believed that Bola Eun was seeking a way of surrendering the roins of power, and it seoms certain that the   establishment of a stable and moderate Government would   ruickly relieve the situation to the advantage of the Entente.ROUMiUIAThere are no signs of Bolshevik movements here, chiefly because allied   relief is   forthcoming, and the Roumanians are against the Extremists.    The Army is still cuite   sound,ITALY.The general outlook for   May Bay was disquieting, but it passed off quietly both in the capital and in the provinces.    There was complete abstention from work and in Rome public, meetings were prohibited, but in other townsthey/
they were allowed and they were cuite orderly. The order maintained  may be significant, as showing the unanimity of the country in its determination to show an unbroken front on the ?iume question. President Wilson&apos;s action has united everything vocal in the country in unconditional and fierce support of their delegates.

BALTIC STATES (Esthonia)

The situation in Esthonia is unsatisfactory. On the 27th April a wireless message is reported to have been received from Budapest with an offer of mediation between Esthonia and the Bolsheviks. When this offer became known to the troops it was feared that the morale would become very bad. The Government was ready to continue the struggle if it received a promise of support from the Allies, but otherwise it would have to give way before the pressure of the Socialists for an immediate Peace.

POLAND.

A Communist meeting took place at Warsaw on the 28th April to settle the future action of Communists in the various countries. Delegates from Poland, Russia, Bohemia, Hungary and Germany were present. The present Bolshevik Party is the Communist Labour Party, led by Warski. There has certainly been a growth of the Bolshevik movement since the Armistice, when the pressure of the German military control was relaxed.    Prisoners are reported to be returning from Germany with Bolshevik ideas. The recent strike of agricultural labourers had the support of the Workmen&apos;s Soviet. The Government have declared Martial Law. The Polish Kilitis is not to be depended on and there is talk of disbanding it.

Lithuanian delegates left for Warsaw on April 17th, to discover/
discover tho attitude of the Poles towards the Lithuanian independence and to agree upon a common action against the Bolsheviks.    They complain that Polish troops in Lithuania are assuming the attitude of   conquerors.Bit..Tho ovent of   the week has teen the advance of Admiral kolchak&apos;s troops, who, in spite of a   small set-tack, are now &quot;believed to be within  50 miles of  Moscow.    If the Red Amy begins   to break up, their further progress will be easy. On the other side tho 1-inns   are threatening Petrograd, and we have to face the possibility that, in the confusion that will follow   the break up of the Soviet Government, there may be a nassacro of the Bpurgeoislo bosides which the out-, rages of   ilie Bolsheviks will pale;   with a people so emotional , as   the Russians it is impossible to foretell what will happen, for, if the mood takes them, the people of the towns may receive IColchak with transports of joy:   the trouble  will oomo when kolchak has %o interfore with tho various committees and unions to whioh the people have become   accu3tomod.In tho South General Benekin is holding back the advance of the Bolsheviks   in tho Bon territory and in somo places has assumed the offensive.    From a number of districts comes news of  anti-Bolshe\*Ik demonstrations and of tho killing of Soviet agents;   all this seems to bo part of the gradual sliding of   Bolshevism towards tho abyss.    A report from an American source sta-to   tb?.t 800 workmon were shot at the Putiloff .&apos;orks for opposition to tho Government, and that workmen^ organisations in Petrograd are calling for the ro-ostablidhment of tho Constituent Assembly, the private ownorship of property and the freedom of the press.    Resent-ment against Soviet militarism Is becoming very strong inthe/
tho towns.Madame Spiridonova, who has   just been tried for anti-Bolshovik conspiracy, donounccd Trotsky in court as a coward and tho administration of the Bolsheviks as a scandal. She was sentencod to one year&apos;s detention in a sanatorium as   a   lunati 0.A statement has &quot;boon received from Finland that during a given period tho workmen of Betrograd received wages to the amount of  150,000,000 for products to the value of  4,300,000.    On the   economic side Lenin is reported to have declared that State Control of   economic questions is only another form of trust; he would encourage trusts in Russia with the ultimate aim of taking them over as soon as they became   so efficient that they could  be operated cheaply for   the benefit of the   State.The Bolshevik Government has made fresh overtures for the exchange of British prisoners for  Raskolnikoff, the Russian Commissary for tho Navy,   who was captured in the Baltic and who has been detained in Brixton Prison.    On tho assurance that the prisoners had been put undor domlcilary arrest, Raskolnikoff was liberated from Brixton on the 5th and,   if the Soviet Government accepts the conditions, he and Kiniuk,   a   Chip Commissary, will be sent to Denmark to the care of  the Danish Red Cross.HfllAKD.All reports from Finland indicate great unrest. A serious &quot;Red&quot; conspiracy directed against Mannerheim1s Vlhite Guard has boon discovered, and it is said to be on this ground that tho Government detained Platton and Axelrod on their way back from Russia. Mannerheim is out of favour with tho Swedish Party as being too pro-Entente and Imperialist.Finland/
- 1052Finland at tho moment is soothing with intrigue on the question of  &quot;Intervention In Kussia&quot;,SWEDEN.May Day passed off quietly.    Thoro were no disturbances of  any kind.Bolshevist agitators continue their work in Sweden and are In touch with Russia through their agent Oljelund who is at Potrograd.    Their propaganda is, however, not always favourably rocoivod.Although there is ao Ministerial   Crisis the position of   the  Government Is uncertain.    Tho recent Municipal Elections have largely reduced tho Conservative ranks and have boon greatly in favour of the two peasant parties.Tho success of  tho Social Democrats is loss than was expected.A newly elected Hrat Chamber would probably consist of a    Central Liberal Group with Conservatives and Peasants on one   side and two Socialist Parties on the other.Thoro  are indications that tho Germans are endeavourin to re-establish trade   relations   with X&amp;tente Countries through tho   intermediary of neutrals.A considerable number of Gorman business men are report to have recently arrived in SwGden.MMAgg.More than six hundred &quot;Syndicalist Bolshevist Workshop Clubs&quot; are said to have beon formed since February 1st. They meot twice weekly to discuss Bolshevik agitation. Travelling agitators are financed from Readcuartors.HOLIAHD.Tho result of   the recent elections tends to show the disappearance of all parties of moderate views, the electorbeing either frankly conservative or socialist.    The mostnotable/
notable gain has been the Social Democratic Labour Party, under M. Troolstra, which shows an increase from 69 ? to 116.

Speaking at the Congress of this party at Arnheim, M. Troolstra disclaimed the methods of Bolshevism for Holland and stated that should  revolution visit the Netherlands it must be without Workers&apos; &amp; Soldiers&apos; Councils and with a definite programme of Socialisation. He rejected any kind of collaboration with Communists in Holland end stated that a vigorous movement must be started against the action of the Entente if Peace is to be made  on a Socialistic basis.

A pamphlet by the Communist Party in Holland against Capitalism and stating that "Might is the social revolution" has been distributed to British troops passing through Holland. The Dutch Police have been confiscating them.

Six Dutch Marines, returning to Holland after 4 years&apos; service in the East Indies, passed through New York early in March.  They are all Socialists and attended and spoke at a Socialist Meeting, inciting workers in America to follow Russia&apos;s example. One was sailing to Spain with literature.

On their showing, all men before the most in Holland are union men, which means Socialists, they boasted that four months before union representatives had forced concessions from the Admiral of the Fleet, Albarda, which cost him his position.

In answer to the question from the Admiral as to what they would do in case of revolution, they replied that they would stand by their class and not their Government, on which (they said) the whole Fleet was disarmed for 10 days.

At the international Social Congress at Amsterdam on April/
April 26th, Mr. A, Henderson, Secretary of the British Labour Party, was interviewed and stated that in Entente countries there was grave suspicion that Germany&apos;s conversion to democracy was a sham. Why were the Majority Socialists so weakly represented in the German Peace Delegation, and the Independents not at all? By signing the Peace Treaty, Germany would give the best proof that the people in Germany  had really broken with the past and show that they are honestly resolved to help in the reconstruction of the World.

Ramsay Macdonald stated that he was very much against the third International at Moscow. In so far as it is Socialistic the present International is sufficient, and in so far as it is not Socialistic we have nothing to do with it.

SPAIN

The Maura Govommont is very unpopular, and the Republicans predict it early fall. There is a strict censorship preventing any political comments in the Press and though the strikes continue, the Government appears to be in control of the situation.

Reports continue to come in showing the activity of German agents behind the strikes. Some twenty-two Germans, who have been arrested, had founded a "Committee for the defence of Germans not assisted by the Consulate", and were found to be in relation with Bolshevik and Radical groups in Berlin and Vienna. This Committee was working with the anarchists and syndicalists in Barcelona.

A man named M.G. ? from Warsaw, was arrested by the Spanish Police for spreading Bolshovik propaganda. He had   established a secret printing works in the suburbs of Madrid and was distributing literature throughout Cataluna and Andalusia.


80,000 persons took part in the May Day prooosslon in Madrid. They are said to have attempted to seize the Bank of Spain, where they came into oontaot with the Police, thirty of whom wore wounded. Elsewhere May Day seems to have passed off quietly.

?

The labour situation is causing great uneasiness; strikes aro frequent, especially among tramway and telephone employees. The Government appears to be too weak to deal with the inflated demands of the workmen. Though some Bolshovik propaganda is being carried on among the working classes and Bolshevik agents have been arrested, the bad situation is to be attributed mainly to the high cost of living.

Except for a small demonstration of 200 students on May 1st, which was dispersed without casualties, all appears to be quiet. Practically all the railway officials have returned to work and the students at the Elementary Schools have returned to work.

The Delegation of Egyptian Nationalists apparently believe that, the strength of their position lies in the roadiness of Great Britain&apos;s allies to listen to any proposal, which would involve a weakening of British power in Egypt. If they find themselves disabused on this point, it will probably have a great effect on events in Egypt. The French Government has already pledged itself to give them no official support. The Egyptian Delegates have in a very small measure gained the support of the French Press.

The declaration that the United Statos had formerly recognised the British Protectorate has been a severe blow to/
to thorn.A deputation of Official  Administrative  and Religious Loaders   of tho Soudan ia to proceed to London to offer con-gratulations to tho King on the signing   of  tho  Peace Treaty,    It is thought that this will havo a good effect, hut that no useful purpose would bo served by trying to persuade Egyptians who sympathise with us to do the same.There is an idea that England is proposing to abolish tho Mixed Courts   and is insisting that England is to be the only European language for   future use.    This hag had the effect of alienating the lawyers and has brought support to the Nationalist cause.It is reported that the Egyptian Nationalists havo induced the Irish Delegates at tho Berno Conference to further their cause by spreading propaganda on their behalf in the United Kingdom.INDIA. &apos;further information confirms tho roport that the Bolshevik Government   intends to carry on propaganda in India and to establish a connection through Persian diplomatic channels.BINA.The &quot;Union for the freedom of tho East&quot;, which was founded with the object of  diverting the English in Asia, is transferring its contro and main arena of activities to Shirk eg t an.Plans have been made by this Union for sending hundreds of  native agitators to their respective countries in the   Near and 2ar East.SOUTH -AMERICA - ArgentineSerious strikes have taken place in Buenos Ayres. here/
Thoro havo also been series of meetings among the Syndicalists approving of   the constitution of the Ihissi&amp;n Soviet.    The disorders   were   cue lied by thfc enorgetio measures adopted by the Commander of tho 2nd Division, who complains bitterly of   the   weakness of tho Government.Among tho agrarian population tho situation is easier, and a settlement of the banks&apos; striko is now in view,Tho Gorman Secret Committee which was formed at the outbreak of War, consisting of Kmpps and Bahlke and several directors   of German companies, are reportodto have quite lost thoir heads and to be prepared to produce anarchy in the Argentine in order to spite England.    They are said to have ramifications all over the Argentine and to havo boon responsible   for the recent strikes, as  woll as for   the bomb outrages on ships and the inoculation of mules with glanders.    it is now  reported that they are turning thoir attention to assassination, but the necessary steps have been takon.UNITED STATUS 01?  AMERICA,A plot to murder thirty-six prominent men is said to havo boon discovered on March 30th in New York.    A number of bombs were sent through tho ports, and tho ..uthoritios are convinced that tho assassinations were to take place as a  May Day demonstration.It is believed that Ludwig Martens, the Bolshevik representative, is being financed by some of the Ihxssian export firms in Hew York.    At a mooting held in Brooklyn in his honour, on April 11th, Jim Larkin, of the Irish Transport &apos;.:&apos;orkors, made a violent speech.    It Is believed that Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s assurance that thero is no question of recognising   tho Soviet Government will weaken theinfluonce/(
influence of Martens, whose followers have been proclaiming the imminonco of  recognition.John L. Jones, en organiser  of tho Industrial Workers of the world in America, writing to  Tank Ho&amp;gos, Bedretary of tho Miners1 Federation, Days, &quot;Most of our loaders are in prison, and thousands of workers holding the I.W.W. faith are arrested, imprisoned without warrant, held without hearing, deported, and ofton railroaded to a house of correction without trial       Ho oncloses a broad-sheet entitled, &quot;Deportation. A Menace to tho American rabonr Movement&quot;, which was published by tho Now York Defence Committee.    Tho broad-shoot ctatos, &quot;The disastrous conse-Guonoos of these deportations to the Radical labour movement can hardly bo e:cagg orated. &apos; Hot only will the elimination of militant workers make this country safe   for Capitalism.... it will bo used as a   club to break strikes raid crush any democratic movement.    Tho workers of   the unites States must act at once, and so rigorously that tho Authorities will be forced to   call a halt&quot;.The Worton^ Industrial International is opposed to a Communist Conference   with Russian Bolsheviks on the ground that as America has a Constitutional Government, it will not obtain its aims by violence.D.H.T.
