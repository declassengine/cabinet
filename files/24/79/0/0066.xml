(This Document is the Property, of ^ His Britannic Ma j esty&apos;s , Chovenunentj&quot;O^L;     Military Secret.9037 266     )coj-o^y   From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India, mkll^&amp;r lbth May 1919.6623. 1. Our troops occupied Dakka on 13th May,-and we wish to put before you our views on the future military policy. Strategically, politically, historically Jalalabad is the key of Eastern Afghanistan. It lies within four marches of Dakka, and its occupation by onr troops would (a) demonstrate to the frontier tribes as well as disloyal elements in India our military superiority ;(b) limit the war to one between Amanulla&apos;s forces and ourselves ;(c) encourage the pro-British party in Afghanistan ;(d) provide a good advanced base where we could rest our troops in readiness for an autumn campaign against Kabul, should that be necessary ;(e) enable us to utilise the supplies and. resources of Jalalabad Plain.2. The attitude of our Indian troops is excellent, and we do not anticipate any difficulty in reaching Jalalabad and maintaining ourselves there with the forces now mobilising until the autumn, up to which time we could probably (corrupt group ? dispose) British troops in the uplands.3. The tribesmen in Tirah, Waziristan and Khost are so far quiet, but there is an increasing unrest and chance of disturbance which will best be met by the news of our occupation of Jalalabad.&apos; 4. We therefore ask for your early sanction to our proposal. In the meantime we have instructed General Officer Commanding Forces in the Field to make ali preparations.o. We do not at this moment contemplate any advance into Southern Afghanistan, but should offensive operations in that region be unavoidable, then Kandahar is indicated in every way as the objective which would enable us to overcome Afghan opposition and to limit the war in this theatre to one between Amanulla&apos;s forces and ourselves.6. The above was drafted before the request for cessation of hostilities was received from Afghan Comniander-in-Ohief. In our opinion this request has strengthened the reasons for the policy which we advocate.4S
