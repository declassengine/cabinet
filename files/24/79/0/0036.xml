Interim Report on Conditions in Bavaria (March 31 to april 8, 1919).(By Lieutenant G. H. Beyfus, 3rd Duke of Wellington^ Regiment.)CAPTAIN BROAD, Sherwood Foresters, Lieutenant Wareing, R.A., and myself arrived at Wtirzburg on the 31st March. Lieutenant Wareing left for Munich the following day. Captain Broad and myself remained at Wurzburg till Thursday, the 3rd April, and then proceeded to nurnberg. At both places the German authorities, civil and military, placed all the information for which we asked at our disposal. On the 7th April, I received a telephonic message from Captain Harding from Berlin that he wished to hear the latest details with regard to the position in Bavaria. I accordingly came to Berlin yesterday, and am taking the opportunity of the courier service to make this Interim Report; Captain Broad, I know, shares the opinions expressed herein.Food Supplies. Both at Wurzburg and Ntirnberg the scale of rations remains nearly the same as that of last November, with two important exceptions. :&apos;Last November the ration at Wurzburg was 14 kilos, of potatoes per month; it is now 10 kilos., though it&apos; is uncertain whether supplies will be available to give the full ration. The fat ration has diminished from 75 gms. to 62 gms. per week. There has been a rise, on the other hand, in the bread ration from 7 kilos. 100 gms. per month, to 8 kilos. 850 gms. per month.At Ntirnberg the fat ration has remained the same (62 gms. per week), but there has been a serious fall in the potato ration from 6 lbs. per week (with an additional 3 lbs. for the poorer classes, and those engaged in heavy manual labour), to a nominal ration of 4 lbs. per week.   It has, however, not been possible to give more than 2 lbs. per week during the last two weeks, nor has it been possible to give any increase in other rations in compensation.   The town has actually no stock of potatoes, but depends on weekly supplies.    It needs 8,000 centners weekly for a distribution of 4 lbs. per head, and on Monday (7th inst.), had already received 1,000 centners.   The officials hoped this week they might be able to supply the full ration.   The nominal ration of meat at Wurzburg was 275 gms. weekly for the last four weeks, but they have no supplies, in hand and depend on what they can obtain from the surrounding country.* During the last four weeks, they were only able to distribute 780 gms. in all,, instead of the full ration of. 1,100 gms.At nurnberg, the meat ration is 150 gms. (including bones), and 100 gms. sausage per week. The town has supplies up to the 15th April. Full details and; tables as to rations will be annexed to the detailed report. The rations are in our opinion undoubtedly insufficient to maintain the people in health, and the length of time during which they have lived on such rations has undoubtedly told on them, both morally and physically. The most pressing need is for fats ; then for potatoes (at Nurnberg, particularly), meat and milk.The organization for the distribution of food appears to us efficient. The illicit trading, which enables restaurants to supply more or less plentiful meals, is done directly with the farmers, and so far all efforts appear to have failed to put a stop to it. But we have little doubt that the food under the control of the city authorities is fairly distributed, and that any food supplies sent by the Allied Governments can safely be entrusted to them for distribution.Clothing. The lack of clothing is- almost as serious as that of food, and must be regarded as an important contributory factor to the prevailing unrest. Prices have risen by 1,000 per cent, and more, while materials themselves are of the very poorest quality. Paper materials are much used, and are from three to ten times the price of the woollen materials sold before the war. A comparative table of prices will be found in the detailed report.   There is a similar lack of boots and[148]-D.P.-19.4.19.-Misc. 33.  [7714]
shoes, though for men the position lias been a little improved lately by the release of military stocks. Wool, cotton, linen, thread, and leather are urgently needed to cover the barest necessities of the people.Transport. We have not yet had time to examine the transport question at Nurnberg. At Wurzburg it was alleged that full use could not be made of the Rhine and the Main owing to the confiscation of cargoes en route by British, American, and French officers, which made owners reluctant to use this means of transport, although there was an ample supply of barges and tugs available.The wish was expressed that goods intended for South Germany should be sent to Rotterdam and not to a North German port.The greatest difficulty with regard to railway transport appears to be the number of engines in need of repair and the difficulty of repairing owing to lack of iron. The lack of engines appears to have been met chiefly by the reduction in the number of passenger trains, while goods trains have only diminished from 159 in August 1914 to 136 at the present time.Other raw materials particularly needed are lubricating oil, copper and asbestos.Military Situation. The troops both in the 2nd and 3rd Bavarian Army Corps appear to be in a thoroughly demoralised state. They have little or no discipline, and all quite untrustworthy.Those at Wurzburg appear to us in a worse state than those at Nurnberg. Few officers wore Uniforms. Only the men of the Sicherhcits-Kompagnie (about 300 strong) were armed, while there were some 5,000 to 6,000 living and being fed in barracks in order that they might not be thrown as unemployed upon the streets and add to the forces of disorder.The same applies to Nurnberg, where the number of semi-demobilised amounts to 20,000 according to the information given to us. The Sicherheit troops at Nurnberg amount at most to 2,000 men. The figures set out above were given to us at the respective headquarters in Wurzburg and Nurnberg, and we have not been able to check them, but we do not think there can be any doubt as to the hopeless state of moral and total lack of discipline among all except the Sicherheits-Truppen, and even these were not regarded as trustworthy by the authorities.Political Conditions. The position both at Wurzburg and Nurnberg is critical. On Sunday the Raterepublik was proclaimed at Munich. On Monday morning there was great anxiety at Nurnberg in official circles, but the situation was momentarily eased by the rejection of a motion in favour of the Raterepublik by the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council of Nurnberg by a majority of 138 to - 70. However, there was great activity that night at the General-Kommando, which was already fortified with barbed wire, sandbag barricades, machine-guns, &amp;c, when we arrived in Nurnberg. Yesterday morning, however, the position was again considered most critical by the&apos; authorities. Martial law had been proclaimed, cavalry patrolled the streets, the Rathaus was closed, except for one side-door, which was strongly guarded. I saw the Burgermeister yesterday morning (the 8th April, 10 a.m.) before leaving for Berlin, and he informed me that some of the troops (Sicherheits-Truppen) had refused service, and that he might have to resign within a few hours. I have spoken to Captain Broad at Nurnberg over the telephone to-day (the 9th April, 2 a.m.), and he informed me that the situation there remains unchanged, though still dangerous.Attitude of the People. The greatest danger lies in the fact that the nerves of the German people appear to have broken down. A people of little political understanding, they imagined, when the Armistice was signed, that peace was immediately at hand and that the privations of four and a-balf years were over. Five months have passed, and their exaggerated hopes of a speedy peace, of quick supplies of food and clothing hopes unduly encouraged by a somewhat reckless Press have been disappointed. Hope deferred has made the German heart sick. From the heights of hope of last November-and in spite of the disaster that had overtaken them the Armistice was hailed with genuine joy in Germany they have plunged into the depths of despair. And it is this despair which has given Bolshevism its chance. Russian agents are undoubtedly at work, and their German comrades are promising ample food supplies from Hungary, Roumania, and Russia; the Germans, despairing of help from the West, are turning their eyes to the East. The Hoffmann Government, in its latest proclamation-mation, finds itself compelled to denounce the &quot;criminal folly&quot; of those who are
opromising supplies from Russia and Roumania, where the famine is far worse than in Germany, and is holding out the prospect of food supplies from the &quot;West within the next few weeks. But it is doubtful whether words are any longer of avail. The Germans have read so much and heard so much of. the promised food supplies that they no longer believe in them. It is only the actual arrival and distribution of food which will allay their doubts. It appears to us to be the sincere opinion of most of those with whom we have spoken (and to be confirmed by the chance conversations we have overheard, e.g., while travelling), that the arrival of adequate supplies will check the wave of unrest and the movement towards Bolshevik chaos, which is undoubtedly making great strides at the moment. We are by no means sure that this opinion is not over-optimistic, and that those who have told us &quot; You have come too late! &quot; are not right. But we are satisfied that the arrival of adequate supplies without delay is the one hope of saving the country from lapsing into chaos.The question of price, however, will be an important one in considering how far the arrival of food supplies will restore quiet and order to the country, and also as to whether this food will reach those who are most in need of it. We were informed at Nurnberg, for example, by a high official of the local Food Control Office, that the price of the potatoes coming from England would work out at 50 pf. a pound, while the official maximum price at Nurnberg at present is 11 pf. This was due principally, he thought, to the rate of exchange. Whatever the reason, in so far as food supplies are regarded as a weapon against Bolshevism, the question of price as well as the adequacy of the supply must be carefully considered.The attitude of Nurnberg may well decide the success or failure of the Bolshevik movement in Bavaria, and the position in Nurnberg appeared to Captain Broad and myself yesterday morning to be critical. We therefore decided that I should suggest to General Ewart that Major Sherman of the American Army, who is at present at Nurnberg in charge of the Allied supplies for Russian prisoners of war, should be given discretionary power to arrange with the German authorities that they should have some of the spare supplies of bacon and ham in his charge at Nurnberg on terms of repayment later, if it appeared to .him desirable. There are over 100,000 pounds of bacon and ham lying at Nurnberg now, and if the authorities at Nurnberg are able to double the fat ration this week with the help of supplies obtained from the Allied Governments, the moral effect might just turn the scale. I understand that General Ewart is endeavoiiring to give effect to this suggestion.Military Section,British Delegation,April 9, 1919.
