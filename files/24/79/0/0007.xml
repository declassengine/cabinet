I   1I circulate this memorandum by GanoralHsealy,and would beg for the earliest possible consideration.the matter is reall^r urgent.6/5/19.W.S.C,
An agreement was arrived at between the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Supply regarding  supply arrangements, under which non-standardised supply was to be clone by the Air Ministry and the romaining branches of supply to be done by the Ministry of Supply,   Agreement was also reached between the two Departments as to the transfer of staff to the Air Ministry from the Directorate General of Aircraft Production in the Ministry of Munitions to carry out the above arrangements^   Provision for this staff was made on the Air Ministry estimates for .1919 - 20.   The question of these arrangements was referred to the Cabinet by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Cabinet Paper G,T, 7034) and It has been so far impossible to obtain any decision about it.   The result is that the Director General of Supply and Research has no Department in the Air Ministry under hirn, though he has been appointed provisionally to act as Director General of Aircraft Producti5n pending a decision by the War Cabinet.   It is impossible to make any progress whatever in settling the future organisation for the supply work to be undertaken by the Air Ministry, which work would include provision for experiment and research.   The staff working in the Directorate General of Aircraft Production is being broken up and several officers, the retention of tthose services for experimental and research purposes i3 judged to be vital, have received advantageous offers from outside which they must accept or refuse within a few days. In the absence of a settlement of ministerial responsibility and the submission to the Treasury and approval by the Treasury of an Establishment, it is impocsible to make them any offer of employment which they could consider as an alternative to the offers before them from outside.   One of the officers referred to is an officer required for tho development of oxygen apparatus, a matter of the first import anise to the fuUire of aviation, and another is an officer of high scientific attainments and experience in aeronautical research whose retention in the department is pressed for in the strongest terms by members of the Aeronautics Advisory Committee and Air Inventions Committee.Unless an immediate decision is arrived at the consequences to the development of aviation will be serious; at the present stage of that development it is essential that there should be no avoidable difficulties in the sphere of government action as regards experiment and researhh, It is accordingly strongly urged that the question should be Immediately decided by the Cabinet.6.5.19.(Int)   J.S.
