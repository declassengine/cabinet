I submit for consideration the draft Heads of two Agreements between Hi3 Majesty^ Government and the Australian producers of Lead and Copper, which have been prepared in consultation with the Minister of Supply in pursuance of representations made to the Prime Minister by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia as to the desirability of assistance being given to the Australian industries concerned in view of the services rendered by them during the war and the situation in which they are at present placed.As regard Jgftd the position is that the great bulk of the world-s production (probably over 70$) is in the United States, Australia and Spain.   The United States production Goes normally entirely into domestic consumption and is protected b&apos; an import duty.  Competition in the supply to the European market is between Australia and Spain and owing to its geographical position Spain has great advantages over Australia., During the war the American and Spanish producers have obtained very high prices and made very large profits;    the Australian producers voluntarily accepted the controlled prices establish^ by the British Government,The world *s stocks of lead probably amount to just over 300,000 tons of which approximately 200,000 tons is the property of His Majestyfs Government; the world1a consumption of lead since the Armistice has been very small and is likely to contine so until
there is a general recovery -of industry-and trade. Tho Lead market, owing to heavy stocks and low consumption, is&apos; in a very dangerous state /and if the present Government stocks come on the restricted market there will be a verv heavy fall in &quot;orices which will be disastrous to the Australian producers and might compel them for a time to shut down.   On the other hand prices must be reduced to a level which will give confidence to the con aimers. . There is, however, general agreement that after a time, say in a year or 18 months, the position is likely to be reversed and the supplies of lead be short.As regards Qopper, tho position is different. Tho Australian production,&apos; though the only important source within the Empire and of appreciable service during&apos; the war, is very small relatively to the world&apos;s production and requirements, and there is no reason to anticipate any appreciable shortage in the world1s supply.  Nevertheless it is clearly desirable that production within the Empire should be encouraged so far as practicable,.and the temporary assistance to the Australian producers now proposed will be of some service in that direction, whilst it will remove any feeling that the services rendered by the Australian producers have not been adequately recognised.May 15th, 1919.
