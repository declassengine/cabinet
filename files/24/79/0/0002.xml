Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, tih May 19.19.rX&amp;fl (Received 4th. G pan.)Mali, &amp;-hj^ss^ssBecret,   Afghanistan.   Following two telegrams from Roos-Keppel:First, 3rd May, 4 p.m. :--&quot; Afghan Com man der-i n-Ch ief has gone from Dakka to Jalalabad but has left his escort at Bakka. This morning the Khyber Rifles caravan escort to Laudi Khana was&quot; confronted by pickets of armed Afghans in the disputed zone between Tar Khain and Landi Khana. Pickets threatened to lire on Khyber Rifles if latter advanced, but they- were iirm and went on to usual point without incident. Afghans were (? word omitted) acting in concert with tribesmen under the notorious Zar Shah, and as far as can be ascertained there were no Afghan troops or military force among them. Ningrahar is much out of hand, and this incident may merely be a piece of impudence on the part of Zar Shall. On the other hand Zar Shah may lie acting under orders and incident may be first move in reviving old boundary dispute. If Afghans persist in their present attitude, does Govern-ment wish us to continue to send escort, if necessary, using force to Tor Khani, which is extreme limit of our claim, or would Government prefer to avoid trouble by our not going beyond Landi Khana ? Piece of nullah bed in dispute is less than a mile in length. It is valueless in itself but important as its possession by Afghans might give them a claim to Bagh villages. Dispute should be settled by Boundary Commission, but when we have tried to settle it in the past Amir has made excuse and not sent Commissioners. Kurrain telegraphs that air is full of rumours of trouble in Afghanistan and Turis who are always nervous are apprehensive of attack. Tochi telegraphs reporting rumours of movement(s) of troops. It is rumoured in Peshawar that Nasrulla Khan has died in jail of poison. There is no doubt reaction against Amanulla is increasing in districts of Afghanistan and that there is considerable apprehension in Kabul/&apos;Second, 3rd May, midnight:  .&quot; Sarhang of Dakka has sent letter to Political Agent in Kliybcr warning him of passage of Zar Shah Lashkar. This is camouflage, as they purposely 1 spoke loo fate, and it is now (? quite clear that) Zar Shah is acting on instructions. His gang killed five coolies on waterworks last night. We have get into touch with Zar Shah, who sajs that he has been sent by Sipah Salar to coni-mence hostilities but that he will do as little as possible until Afghan troops arrive. He has given us lithographed copy of farman sealed by Amir which appears to be undoubtedly genuine. I will telegraph text of -farm an as soon as it can be cyphered. Farman begins by reference to unrest in India, goes on with Indians have been faithful and loyal to the British Government through war and are now rewarded by cruelty and injustice. It repeats usual denouncement, of Rowlatt Bills, exhorting Afghans to follow order of Saleh Muhammed Khan., new Commander-in-Chief, who will explain fully Amir&apos;s orders and intentions. Sipah Salar has been talking quite openly of holy Avar. Farman winds up with, an exhortation to all to win favour of God and obey will of the Prophet, which is a clear incitement to Jehad, although the word is not used. It is said that 2-15 farman3 have been sent to Peshawar, and very inflammatory letters, sent to tribes. Shinwaris * and Mohmauds are pouring into Jalalabad where it is said rifles and ammunition are being distributed, i^ew Afghan Envoy Abdur Rahman and Afghan Postmaster have done all in their power to influence by their reports Amir to take this course, and Postmaster is now at Jalalabad conferring with Sipah Salar after many interviews with Union Committee in Peshawar. If he were arrested at Landi Kotal on his return journey, and) Afghan Post Office here searched, many compromising documents would probably be found, but Afghans would presumably make reprisals on the British Agent. Tone of Khyber Rifles, Shinwaris and Afridis good. I have asked General Officer. Commanding, to have Khyber Column ready, and to (? group omitted) German and Austrian prisoners as soon as possible, but I do not propose to send Expeditionary Force Landi Kotal until situation is much worse as movements would have disturbing influence in Peshawar. Kuram reports Afghan activities on Peiwar Kotal and Pani Kalar among Turis.&quot;SS 86  45  5/19 [P.T.6.
\fi I&apos;&apos;i)uFrom. Viceroy,&apos;4Ik May .19.1.0. (Received 5th May, 10.45 a.m.)Clear the lino.Secret. Afghanistan. My immediately preceding telegram. Translation farm an is as follows : &quot; To all subjects of the Eastern circles who are (? Sayyid) Sheikhs (? zealous) Khans and Motabars I send this order and tell yon that in India there is great unrest; almost all the Hindus and Muhammadans have remained faithful and sincere to Government, and proved themselves loyal, subjects, but it is a . pity that they have been rewarded by cruelty (Zulni) and injustice of all kinds in . connection with their religion, their honour (Izzat) and their modesty (Sharm). The last news which has reached your King Amir Amanulla is very distressing, and everyone cannot but lament and hate such deeds of injustice. In short, the account of these injustices is that no one, Hindu or Muhammadan, will have any right of ownership to his land and property, nor will anyone have power to speak much more (&apos;?), three (?) men (?cannot) stand in one place, nor can they go to mosque (?) Hindus cannot go to their (? temples), if they go there or collect, without any investigation and at word of the Criminal Investigation Department, they will be punished. There are other examples of such orders and rules which are contrary to the rights of humanity. I make you aware of all these things. According to international law, I cannot interfere with the internal policy of the British Government, and 1 have nothing to do with it. But from the point of view of Islam and of humanity, 1 do not like unfair laws, and I see that Indians are right in rising (?and in) creating disturbances.&quot; These risings and disturbances are not limited to India. Their bad effects are seen also in Afghanistan, This it is the duty of your King to warn his faithful subjects to remain united and ardent, -do not scatter but catch fast the rope of God.;&apos; Act upon order of God and do not become broken up, because God the Creator has given us this order that in a time of such, disorder we should leave aside all. our differences and distinctions and pride and help each other. Hindus, Muhammadans, Christians and Jews (?) are all God&apos;s children. Sympathy and philanthropy towards the poor are virtues of the children of Adam and Eve. It is a pity that the British consider no one except themselves as human beings.&quot;We have nothing to do with them nor do we know what will be the result of these things. In conformity with one of the duties of the kingdom of Afghanistan, I deputise Saleh Muhammad Khan, Comniander-in-Chief, who has all the virtues of soldierliness and righteousness, to be Commanding Officer of the Eastern circle, both in a civil and mililary (? basis) giving him full powers for the protection and the good of that circle (?) and for the preservation of its unity and community acting honestly, regardfully (?) and bravely, and I depute him. to watch the boundaries care-fully arid to keep you informed of all orders, intentions, and thoughts- of my kingdom which are for the good of the religion of my kingdom and our country, and make united in the attainment of this sacred object.&quot;Thus you may win favour of God and obey the will of the prophet, and remain sincere and subservient finally to (?) the King. For the good of this world and of the next depends upon these things. God be with you!&quot; &quot;Seal of Amanulla.&quot;-Wording of the farman though about as bad as it could be, still leaves loop-hole that Amir lias not committed himself definitely. We are (? impressing) koos-Keppel of the capital importance of avoiding all frontier incidents at Tor Jvham or elsewhere, and asking him to consider the advisability of Abdul Qayum trying to fix up meeting with Commander-in-Chief on the frontier. Message from Viceroy to Amanulla is under preparation.
