The Committee was appointed on the 5th September, 1918, partly on the recommendation of the Committee on Production, as a result of claims made by women substitutes on men&apos;s work, to the same advances. The Committee&apos;s terms of reference were: &quot; To investigate and report upon the relation which should be maintained between the wages of women and men, having regard to the interests of both, as well as to the value of their work. The recommendations should have in view the necessity of output during the war, and the progress and well-being of industry in the future.&quot;Subsequently the questions of fact involved in the allegation that the Government had failed to carry out the pledge in respect of wages embodied in the Treasury Agreement of March, 1915, was referred to the Committee.The Committee has taken a wide vfew of its reference,&apos;and the Majority Report is a general survey of the position of women in industry. Historical and analytical chapters on. the employment of women before the war, on women&apos;s wages before the war, on the employment of women during the war, and on women&apos;s wages during the war, precede chapters on the future employment and wages of women and &quot;on the future relations between women&apos;s and men&apos;s wages.   A separate -part is devoted to the question of the(c 1777)   150  fi/19 h k s a
Governments pledges in 1915, the Committee finding that the allegation of non-fulfilment is not sustained on any point. A detailed memorandum by the medical member of the Committee on the health of women in industry is included. There is also a Minority Report,, covering the whole of the Committee&apos;s reference, by Mrs. Sydney Webb.The Committee estimate that women&apos;s wages during the war have risen more than; the cost of living-probably three-fold as against a rise in the cost of living only two-fold. They estimate further that the disparity between the general level of women&apos;s wages and that of men&apos;s is less than before the war; then the average.wage of women was probably under half, now it is probably over two-thirds that of men. This change in the relation they attribute to the Governments control of wages during the war ; but rather to the Government^ action in preventing male labour from exploiting the opportunities offered to labour by the abnormal relations of demand and supply than to the effect of Orders and Awards in forcing womenS wages up. The Committee found that before the war at any rate, cases were relatively few in number in which men and women were engaged on exactly identical processes, and that in the most important of these cases men and women were paid at the same rate. Usually there was a differentiation of work between the sexes, accompanied by divergence of. rates of pay. &quot; As a rough generalisation,&quot; the Committee states on p. 67 &quot; it would be true to say that the higher earnings of women as well as the closer approximation to the earnings of men were found in those trades which were paid on piece and in which the work done by men and women was most similar, while the low rates and the greater disparity occurred in the male occupations in which women provided only subsidiary and subordinate services, being classed in fact with boys and lads.&quot;The Committee&apos;s recommendations are based on their analysis of the causes of the lower general level of womenS wages. These, they state to be, first, womenS relative physical disabilities ; secondly, a conventional depreciation of womenS labour, due, in its turn, to the fact that women enter industry, expecting to leave it on marriage, are less adequately trained and less well-organised than men. Hence their labour is less in demand for occupations requiring strength, training, stability or organisation, and they are forced to crowd into a limited range of womenS occupations. To meet these disabilities the &apos; Committee recommend the further regulation of conditions of employment, provision for better training, a basic subsistence wage (to be established by statute immediately on the expiry of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act), and the opening of new occupations to women, their fitness for which has been proved during the war, by negotiation between employers and trade unions. The better physique and training and the wider choice of employment afforded by these measures will, it is argued, through the operation of the ordinary laws of supply and demand, raise womenS wages nearer to menS.On the specific point of the relation that womenS wages should bear to menS, the Committee considered two alternative policies, one, urged almost unanimously by trade union spokesmen, of identical rates (time or piece) for men and women in each occupation ; the other, which the Committee adopt, of equal pay for equal work in the sense that pay should be proportionate to efficient output. In deciding against the trade union claim the Committee were influenced mainly by the consideration that equal time rates would usually have the effect of excluding women from an occupation when men could be got, and by the fear that the sudden introduction of so novel a principle would have un-favourable reactions on industrial prosperity.The Report includes recommendations for giving practical effect to these principles; The relative efficiency of men and women on the same, or similar work, should be settled by Joint Industrial Councils or Trade Boards, and payment of women in the ratio so determined should be made a condition of receiving public contracts by the Fair Wages Clause. The subsistence wage should be calculated by a special authority and revised as occasion required, and should be based on the needs of a single woman without dependants. The Government should take into consideration the question of paying pensions to widows with dependants, and other women who for any reason need similar assistance, and also the question of paying the entire expenses of lying-in. In the case of its own/employees the Government should at once apply the principle of equal pay for equal work; but should, where equal pay will not attract men of adequate capacity and training, consider the payment in addition of childrenS allowances to married men; a similar provision is Tecommended to Local Authorities in the case of teaching.Sir William Mackenzie dissents from the recommendation of a legal, national minimum wage, on the ground that minimum rates should be upon a trade basis, and that an extension of the existing provision of Industrial Councils, Trade. Boards, and Orders under the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, would meet the need. Mrs. WebbS Minority Report supports the trade union claim to identical rates for men and women, recommends a
National minimum, in which there should be no sex inequality, and State provision for children and maternity, and asks for a Royal Commission of enquiry into the distribution of wealth, with- a view to the &quot; Adoption of a New Principle, namely, that of Closer -Correspondence of Occupational Rates to Relative Efforts and Needs.&quot; &quot;It will be noted that the Committee unanimously support the proposal recently made by the Provisional Committee of the National Industrial Conference, that minimum rates should be established throughout industry, by legislation where trade union organisa-tion is inadequate ; but they differ, as apparently the Industrial Conference differed, as to the best method of carrying out the principle. The majority recommendation is substantially that of the National Industrial Conference, stated in more detail and with more precision. They contemplate actual rates being settled in most cases by Industrial Councils and Trade Boards, and would even permit Trade Boards to fix a rate below the National minimum, where such a reduction was the only way of meeting foreign competi-tion; they are of opinion, however, that the employment of women and girls does not admit of such satisfactory regulation by trades as does men&apos;s, and they regard as the first essential of an improvement in women&apos;s wages a way of escape from &quot; the vicious circle of low efficiency-low wages low organisation.&quot;From this, as already stated, Sir William Mackenzie dissents. In this connection he says that &quot; so far as regards the effect of the proposal on the trades affected, the results of such a policy may seriously impair their future prosperity and development, and should this happen the worker will be injured as much or even more than the employer. The trades and callings concerned are those with regard to which the least information is available as to the conditions under which they are carried on ... . They are trades with respect to which little detailed and reliable evidence has been avail-able for our &quot;use. The bulk of the evidence which has been placed before us ... is in respect of better organised trades, for which admittedly no case has been made out for the establishment of one and the same national and hard and fast minimum rate.&quot; There is no doubt that these remarks as to lack of information are correct, and it would not appear certain even that the Committee consulted all available sources in this matter. Thus the experience of the Trade Boards Division of the Ministry of Labour was not made use of.It is notiqeable that the Committee appear to attach no importance to the difference between men and women in respect of dependants as a cause of the difference between men&apos;s and women&apos;s wages. It is worth remark, perhaps, that in a detailed history of the Ministry of Munitions&apos; control of women&apos;s wages recently circulated a very different view is taken. In a concluding chapter this difference is represented as the most important factor. &quot; An explanation is needed also why competition for employment does not force workers, labouring under so many disadvantages as women, to accept even lower rates than they do. . . . The explanation is probably to be found in a customary limitation of competition. Customary standards are established for which the great mass of workers in any grade or class will stand out. Wages tend to be pressed down by competition until this limit is reached, when competition ceases to operate. . . . Now, the majority of women have no dependants ; the majority of men maintain a family.&quot; It may be noted in parenthesis that this is a statement the truth-or rather the applicability  of which is strongly disputed by Mrs. Webb in the Minority part of the Report under review. &quot; The customary standard in the case of women is therefore lower than in the case of men. . . . It is through this influence on the customary standard of women workers that the fact that in the majority of cases women have no dependants influences wage rates ; whether it ought to do so is an entirely separate question. ... If this analysis is correct, the lower general level of women&apos;s wages is the outcome of one of the most fundamental of social conditions, the economic unity of the family.&quot; If this analysis is correct, too, it explains the male trade unionises desire for the single rate, which would tend to segregate men and women, and secure automatically a division of labour between them. For if women as a rule can and will accept a lower rate than men as a rule, the admission of women in any numbers to a trade will tend to result in a rate of wages lower than if it were confined to men. The rule of equal pay for equal work will, so far as it can be maintained in practice, protect the rates in operation when the women first come into a trade ; it is the subsequent movement of wages that the trade unionist fears. These fears are important, since the Committee relies on agreement between employers and trade unions to open new occupations to women, and agreement&apos; on the Committee&apos;s basis of equal pay for equal work is unlikely, except in industries in which piece rates are the rule and the extended employment of women already easy. And, leaving on one side the trade unionists prejudices, the effect on the future movement of wager; of the introduction of women to a trade is the more important problem.   Cases in which men
and women are paid different rates for exactly the same work are, the Committee dis-covered, rare ; the common case is the substitution of women for men, as a result of some change of process followed by a disproportionate drop in wages.Part II. Demobilisation and Resettlement.Apprenticeships Interrupted by War Service.The plan for&apos; the resumption, with State assistance, of apprenticeships interrupted by war service is now well advanced, and in the case of certain industries is already in operation. The general outline of the scheme is simple, and its acceptance, in principle, was readily conceded both by employers and by workmen, but its adaptation to fit the varying conditions of different industries has naturally involved somewhat prolonged negotiations. These have been conducted with the National Joint Industrial Councils for certain industries; in the case of other industries, less completely organised for example, the brush making industry-with the National Industrial Reconstruction Committee ; and. in others for example, boot making and repairing with the National Trade Advisory Committee for Disabled Sailors and Soldiers, whose terms of reference were expanded to meet this new purpose. It has been necessary to make arrangements varying with different trades as to the rate of wages to be paid to the apprentice, the age limits of the scheme, the amount of. time to be deducted from the apprenticed period of training as an offset against his period of service in the Army, the importance which was to be attached to service (if any) in a technical unit, and other points. Despite these difficulties, however, progress has not been unduly slow. At the present time schemes for 12 industries have been approved finally by the Ministry, and are either already in operation or on the point of coming into operation. Five others only await the approval of the Ministry. In five cases draft schemes are under consideration by the industries affected, and in. eight other cases negotiations have not yet reached the stage of the production of a draft scheme. It should be pointed out, however, that the 12 schemes finally approved * cover industries which, as regards the problem of interrupted apprentice-ship, are by far the most important. It is estimated roughly that in July, 1914, they covered over four-fifths of the total number of apprentices in the country, and that they include the chief trades which suffered the most severely from enlistment.The schemes which for the moment are the furthest advanced are those for the engineering, furniture and shipbuilding industries. The engineering scheme as finally approved may be taken as an example of the arrangements made. It allows the reduction of the period of apprenticeship by the full length of time served in His Majesty&apos;s Forces provided that the reduction does not exceed two years. Training under the scheme may be either continuous training in the employer&apos;s establishment, part-time training in the employer&apos;s establishment supplemented by part-time training in a technical institution, or whole-time trainingjin a technical institution. During any period during which the apprentice, while under the age of 21, is employed in the employees establishment, he is to receive the rate of wages which he would have been receiving if his apprenticeship had not been interrupted by service with the Forces. From the age of 21 to 23 he is to be paid the rate prescribed for his class under the Wages Temporary Regulation Act (1918), less a sum diminishing with increasing age from 10s. until at the age of 23 the full prescribed rate is received. These rates apply from the outset if the apprentice on his return has attained the age of 21 ; if he is already 23, he is to be paid the full rate prescribed under the Wages Temporary Regulation Act. The employer, however, does not pay the whole of the apprenticed wages; the State gives a wages allowance amounting to a third of the prescribed rate. This allowance is payable for a period equal to the difference between the original apprenticeship and any period of service in a technical unit together with a third of the period of service in His Majesty&apos;s Forces, provided that this latter period does not exceed a third of the unexpired period of the original apprenticeship. In any case, the wages allowance will not be paid for a longer period than two years. It is received by the apprentice when his original apprenticeship would have terminated or when he reaches the age of 21,f whichever may be the earlier date.* The industries are as follows :-Engineering; furniture manufacture; shipbuilding; coach, motor-body building and wheelwright industry; baking (Scottish); printing and allied industries; ironfounding; electrical, contracting, building, brush-making; printing (Scottish); and silk.f In Scotland, 23 (when applicable).
If the whole or a part of the training is given in a technical institution, a maintenance allowance in place of wages is made by the State at the rate of 336&apos;. a week for a single man, and, in case of a married man, an additional 6s, for the first child and 3s. for each additional child. In addition an allowance for fees is made to cover in whole or in part the institutional charges for training.A certain amount of evidence is already available as to the immediate prospects of the scheme in the engineering industry. Its reception has varied considerably in different parts of the country. On the North-East Coast, at Gloucester and at Newton Heath, applications have been numerous, while, on the other hand, in important centres such as Woolwich or Liverpool, there has been hitherto little evidence of readiness to come under the scheme. In part, these facts are explicable as arising from purely temporary causes. In some cases misunderstandings exist as to the scope of the scheme, which can easily be removed. In other cases, as for example in the Black Country, employers, especially the smaller firms, appear somewhat indifferent. At Wolverhampton the practice of moving about from firm to firm while learning is expected to prove a hindrance. A similar, difficulty may be encountered in other places in. the Midlands, though it is not impossible that the scheme itself, by drawing attention to these defective methods, may eventually influence the establishment of a sounder system of training. Some limitation of the full operation of the scheme may arise from the fact that employers had already concluded private arrangements with their returning apprentices before the Government scheme was complete. Non-federated firms and non-unionist labour are showing reluctance in some places to come under schemes negotiated with the Joint Industrial Councils. In no case is it intended to impose the Government scheme upon the workers or the employers, but financial assistance from the Government is contingent upon a strict acceptance of the Government scheme.It may be noted generally as regards the engineering scheme that the full period of its usefulness cannot arrive until it becomes possible to demobilise the Army of Occu-pation. Owing to the long-continued protection from recruitment given to the engineering trades, apprentices frequently entered the Forces at a late age and are therefore liable to retention under the present conditions of demobilisation. It will be on the return of these workers that the value of the scheme will be fully tested.Part III. Press Comments. (1) Labour and Socialist Press. (A) Foreign Affairs.The International Situation.The official abstract of the Peace terms had not been published when the papers reviewed this week were written. But in reviewing the general position on the eve of their publication the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; is filled with misgivings and apprehensions. It alleges that India, Egypt and Ireland are being held down by the sword and that the Socialist Republic in Hungary is to be devoured just because it is a democratic state. Mr. Arthur Ponsonby in the same paper regards the situation as hopeless and dangerous, in that those who held the controlling power (President Wilson alone excepted) were devoid of high-minded and farsighted views. The &quot; New Age &quot; concludes that the peace terms are not yet in their final form and regards the interval between their publication and signature as the opportunity for world opinion to make itself heard. On the other hand, Mr. Arthur Henderson, in an interview with a foreign journalist at Amsterdam (as reported in the &quot; Merthyr Tydfil Pioneer &quot;), implied that his opinion was that Germany must first sign the treaty before the workers in the Fmtente countries had an effective -weapon for energetic action in her favour.The League of Nations.&quot; Forward &quot; hopes that the day on which the Covenant of the League of Nations received the approval&apos; of the Peace Conference will be one of the great dates in history. It does not regard the absence of popular representation in the Assembly of the League as an invincible objection. (The Socialist Parties, it says, must make themselves so clearly strong that they cannot be denied a share in the delegations). It points out that the unitary vote is an old Trade Union Congress difficulty, and to all criticism would reply
that the constitution of the League is not of cast iron. Given-a determination for the success of the League on the part of the United States, France and Great Britain, and a reasonable satisfaction now of national claims, it believes that we shall enter a new climate of opinion in which the ideas of conciliation and co-operation will naturally flourish, &quot; Justice,&quot; in view of the rejection of the French amendment for the establishment of an armed force at the disposal of the League, doubts whether the project itself will have much headway; but thinks that it does provide at least a starting point for the internationalism of the future. Mr. Arthur Ponsonby in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; regrets that it should start its career with the heavy burden of what he regards as the defects of the other parts of the treaty of Peace.President Wilson.President Wilson continues to be the member of the Paris Conference who is almost always singled out in these papers for a personal reference. The &quot; Call&quot; quotes with approval the Italian Socialist opinion that President Wilson&apos;s stand on the Fiume problem was not inspired by idealist reasons. The &quot; New Age &quot; thinks that President Wilson is himself responsible for the difficulty in that &quot; he explicitly invited the new power of world opinion to attend the conference and then agreed to exclude it from information.&quot; Mr. Ponsonby (as noted above) exoepts him from his condemnation of the other statesmen at Paris, and &quot; Forward &quot; regards him as the great pilot of the League of Nations. The only specific reference to the British Delegation is made by the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; to Lord Robert Cecil (&quot; who in his speeches and aims is far superior to the gang with whom he has to work &quot;).Italy.The &quot; British Citizen &quot; reiterates its declaration that we should disgrace ourselves if we played Italy false, and recommends Serbia to turn her attentions to Bulgaria.Belgium.&quot; Justice &quot; says that the stupidity of the &quot; Big Four &quot; has nearly caused a revolution in Belgium, and maintains that the condition of affairs is made still worse by the restrictions which, it says, still hamper trade between England and Belgium.Denmark.The &quot; Democrat &quot; publishes a letter from M. Peter Hedebol, a Danish Labour Leader, who refers to the unemployment caused by the blockade, and pleads for Denmark to be supplied with the articles necessary for industry. He expresses gratitude with the Allied decision with regard to Slesvig and for the sending home of German prisoners of war of Danish nationality.Russia and Hungary.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; protests against the deportation of Russians for their reputed sympathy with the Bolshevik Government, and quotes and amplifies the reported declara-tion of Mme. Breshkovskaya that &quot; no sincere democrat will ever be able to support the dictatorship of Koltchak.&quot; The &quot; Dreadnought&quot; appeals to the London dockers to refuse to touch any ship carrying munitions to Russia. The &quot;Pioneer&quot; (Merthyr Tydfil) and the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; both compare the reported achievements of the Bolshevik regime in Russia and Hungary in matters of education, housing, nationalisation of mines and land, and in diplomatic procedure, with those of the English Government, to the detriment of the latter.The Amsterdam Conference.Mr. Ramsay Macdonald in &quot; Forward &quot; records his impressions of the meeting at Amsterdam of the Permanent Commission of the second (Berne) International. He says that the leaders from the disrupted countries were sad and pessimistic, and feared a total loss of morals and a complete break-up of social cohesion. (On the other hand the &quot; British Citizen &quot; and the &quot; Clarion &quot; doubt whether such representations as these are true.) Three other conclusions he drew from the Conference: (1) The failure of Bolshevism, (2) the growing unpopularity of Great Britain (caused by the blockade and the additions to our colonial power); (3) the distrust of the League of Nations in all countries, but especially in the smaller States.
(B) Home Affairs.The Budget.The reduction of the Excess Profits duty is the item of the Budget which has received most criticism in these papers : &quot; Forward,&quot; &quot; Justice,&quot; the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and the &quot; Clarion &quot; regard this reduction as a present of so much more money to profiteers, The Imperial Preference proposals meet with a more mixed reception. Mr. Hyndman, in &quot; Justice,&quot; says he can understand the idea of giving a preference to our free Colonies but opposes the preference in tea because it would mean, he says, a present of  2,000,000 to a handful of British planters in India. On the other hand, the &quot; Call&quot; states that tea is the one exception in which the Budget changes will mean any reduction in price to the consumer. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; regrets there was no provision in the Budget for the reduction of the National Debt by a capital levy, and the &quot; Call &quot; doubts whether the workers of the future will consent to meet the claims which the present has made on their labour, while the &quot; New Age &quot; invites a voluntary repudiation of part of the debt by its holders. All the papers regard Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s speech as marking the end of the land values duties. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; thinks they were never meant to be a success, and regards it as no misfortune that these &quot; trumpery taxes &quot; should be abolished to make room for a real taxation of land values. The &quot; Democrat &quot; draws from the Budget statement the moral that,the nation must work or otherwise drift into bankruptcy.Unemployment Donation.There are many comments on the debate on the 29th April in the Commons on the Ministry of Labour estimates. Mr. Dan Irving, M.P., in &quot; Justice,&quot; considers that Sir Robert Home &quot; showed himself thoroughly capable and as possessing a good grasp of his subject, upon which he made a lucid, plain statement.&quot; The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; thinks he was wise to declare that whatever might be the abuse of the employment dona-tion, he could never consent to use it to reduce the proper level of wages. The &quot; Call&quot; regards his speech as an exposure both of the employers and the Government, asks why the munition factories were not used to provide unemployment, and thinks that the unemployment donation is the slender thread that prevents a catastrophe. &quot; Forward &quot; attributes the donation entirely to the desire of the Government &quot; not to open the door to revolution,&quot; and in this paper Mr. David Kirkwood gives many instances of what he regards as maladministration of the donation, from the employees point of view. The &quot; Democrat&quot; quotes with approval the statement of the &quot; Daily News &quot; that with the dole for bread and a million people on unemployment pay, we are approaching the con-dition of a pauperised community, and calls for a restoration of the principle whereby every man must support himself by his own efforts.Industrial Conference. &quot;  , .The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; is disappointed with &quot; the reservations and qualifications &quot; in the Prime Ministers letter to the Committee of the Conference on the Governments proposals with regard to&quot; the minimum wage question, and to the legislative regulation of hours of labour. The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; on the whole does not agree with these misgivings, and hopes that the National Industrial Council will now be properly established.Coal Commission.The &quot; New Age &quot; criticises Mr. Sidney Webb&apos;s idea of nationalisation in that it would make the State turn merchant, and says that a change from the threatened centri-petalism of capitalism to that of bureaucracy oilers no advantages. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; asks whether it would not be better for the miners to accept the employers&apos; offer of a share in the control of the mines and to utilise their opportunities under Whitley Councils than to grasp nationalisation (of Mr. Webb&apos;s type) and surrender their trade union weapons. This paper also criticises Mr. Smillie : &quot;His speeches seem to flout and defy all workers who are not of his particular cue.&quot; The &quot; New Age &quot; rejoices in the Postal Clerks Association^ renewed advocacy of, the postal cheque and transfer system, because this would point the way to a democratic financial system which it believes is the first condition of a successful mining or any other national guild. &quot; Justice &quot; is profoundly sceptical of the sanity of the &quot; Guild Socialist&quot; ideals. &quot;
Conscription.The &quot; Pioneer &quot; (Mertlryr Tydfil) quotes Mr. Churchih&quot;s speech in the Commons on the 29th April and concludes that no discharged soldier is safe while he is in office, and therefore recommends those discharged soldiers who want no more soldiering to join the I.L.P. in order to change the Government.Woolwich Arsenal,The &quot; Pioneer &quot; (Woolwich) considers that the adaptation of the Arsenal to the unforeseen and extraordinary conditions created by modern warfare refutes the argument that the Arsenal could not be speedily adapted for work other than munitions of war.Police.&quot; Justice &quot; thinks that there has been a distinct breach of faith with the policemen and says the Government will be to blame if any trouble should occur.Parliamentary Labour Party.The &quot; British Citizen &quot; criticises the Labour Party for ignorance of politics or else sheer indifference; especially, it says, is agriculture ignored by Labour leaders. &quot; For-ward,&quot; in an article on the Aberdeenshire bye-election, says that the Labour Party is not recognised as the official opposition in this country, and that the difficulties of the party are not lessened by the failure of its members to work out a method of working as a team covering the whole field of politics.Trade Union Government.The &quot; Democrat&quot; moralises upon the weakness of the national executives of some (especially Engineering) trade unions as against unofficial, Shop Steward and local move-ments, and says that the first step to remedy this condition of affairs must be to put the election of the National Executives into the hands of the whole Societies as distinct from divisional constituencies.(2) The Daily Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.The Resettlement of Ex-Officers.The &quot; Morning Post &quot; (7th May) is of opinion that this question demands systematic treatment on a national scale in the interest, not only of the unemployed officers, but also of the State. The Government should ensure that all administrative posts in the civil service &quot;are given to ex-officers, that efforts are made on a large scale to bring to the notice of employers the opportunity for engaging ex-officers, by systematic advertisement and personal canvass, and a sum of money should be set aside for the establishment of settlers in British East Africa and other outposts of the Empire. The Government must have a scheme, a policy, and its scale must be adequate to the need.Discharges from Army Pay Offices.The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; (8th May) reports a protest of the South Kensington branch of the National Union of Clerks against the dismissals of discharged and demobilised soldiers and sailors from the Army Pay Offices while women are retained.Position of &quot; Derby &quot; Men.Discussing the position of the men enlisted under the &quot; Derby &quot; Scheme, the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; (9th May) declares that everything depends on what &quot; the end of the war &quot; means. The &quot;Derby&quot; man believes that hostilities terminated on the 11th November., 1918. The Governments position is that they will not terminate till the peace terms are ratified and exchanged. The Government regards every contract as a scrap of paper to be torn up at the bidding of military necessity. It can be moved by no impulse except fear. It is for the great, powerful, peaceful multitude of organised workers to make the Government afraid of doing injustice.
Part IV. (1) General.Coal Commission.The Coal Commission held sittings on the 8th, 9th, .13th and 14th May. Evidence has been heard from the Duke of Northumberland, The Marquis of Londonderry, The Earl of Stafford, Lord Tredegar and the Marquis of Bute on details of the output of coal on their estates and their income from Royalties. Further evidence has been given on the effects of nationalisation by the folloAving technical experts: Mr. McLaughlan, Mr. C. E. Rhodes, Mr. T. H. Bailey, Mr. C. E. Forestier-Walker, Mr. T. Vachell, Mr. Jesse Wall work, Mr. J. Dewrance, Mr. H. F. Plumptre, Mr. E. 0. Forster Brown, Mr. H. E. Mitton ; and also by Sir M. Delevingne (Assistant Secretary, Home Office), Dr. J. S. Haldane (Director, Doncaster Coal Owners&apos; Research Laboratory) and Mr. F. Shufflebotham (Medical Adviser, Ministry of Munitions). It is stated in the press that the Executive of the Scottish Miners Federation have agreed to try to get the Sankey Award carried out for all mine workers-as well as miners.Postal Workers.The Conference of the Postal and Telegraph Clerks&apos; Association has been-held this week at Blackpool. Steps have been taken towards amalgamation with the Postmen&apos;s Federation and the Fawcett Union, and hopes were expressed that the amalgamation thus formed would be able to co-operate on equal terms with the Triple Alliance. Coin-plaints were reported from British postal employees in France of the alleged dilatoriness of the Government in carrying out its pledges with regard to them. A number of resolutions were passed, including an endorsement of the principle of joint control by postal workers and the State, a resolution against the low pay and long hours of night telephonists, and others on more general topics, such as protests against the Blockade, the Military Service Act, the Russian Expedition and the treatment of conscientious objectors. It was also resolved to take measures against the possibility of strike-breaking, but the only definite step in this direction was the decision to include Post Office Pensioners in the Union, in order to prevent them from becoming potential blackbgs.Bakers.The Commission on Night Work continued its sittings at Montagu House on the 8th, 9th, 12th, 13th and 14th May.

The situation in the Brighton area caused by the surplus of labour at Newhaven docks is still acute.The Divisional Employment Council are taking steps to establish a Standing Com-mittee of representatives of employers and employed and of the London and other local War Pensions Committees to advance the interests of disabled ex-service men.South Midlands and Eastern Area.Unemployment. No serious development of unemployment is indicated and no serious increase is expected. The highest increases are reported from Cambridge, Norwich and Leicester. Scarcity of rolling stock is affecting the expansion of brickyards at Peter-borough ; shortage of supplies is holding up biscuit and cocoa works at Bedford and Watford. A shipyard under construction at West Lynn is retarded by lack of housing accommodation for its workers.South- Western Area.Unemployment. Unemployment in this area continues to advance, but the weekly rate of increase is gradually decreasing. Increases are reported from Cheltenham and Bristol, where the National Spelter Works have stopped building operations in progress, throwing 550 men out of employment; the alleged reason is the excessive cost of material and labour. Gloucester and Swindon report an improvement. A scheme for building over six hundred houses at Gloucester has passed the County Council. Unemployment is a serious problem in such ports as Southampton, Portsmouth, Cowes and Plymouth. No further discharges of women, however, are reported from Devonport Dockyard.West Midlands.Unemployment-the main centres of unemployment are Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Smethwick and Cradley Heath. In the Birmingham area employment would improve with increased supplies of steel and iron, which are not forthcoming owing to
Yofhhire and East Midlands.Unemployment. -There is little fresh to report. The situation in the lace towns  Nottingham, Ilkeston and Long Eaton despite some improvement, is still causing appre-hension.General. The movement to secure shorter hours is general. The Notts Miners&apos; Association propose the abolition of all contract work and the substitution of a day-work system. In Sheffield a mass meeting of the engineering trades to discuss night shifts postponed action pending the treatment of the question on a national basis. In the textile industries the Unions are making a stand against the re-introduction of night shift work for women and boys. A further difficulty has arisen with the engineers ; the textile trades are working 48 hours, the engineers work 47, with no overtime even on a break-down. Negotiations are proceeding between the employers&apos; federation and the Amah gamated Society of Engineers, but the latter have refused arbitration.Nor tli-Western.Unemployment. It is hoped that unemployment has reached its maximum in this area. The occupations most affected are naturally in the textile industry, but there is a considerable amount of unemployment among workers classed under the headings of engineering, domestic occupations, commercial occupations and conveyance by road. Two causes of unemployment generally cited are the shortage of railway wagons and the retention of men in the Army who were discovered to he necessary as pivotal after the 31st January. A shortage of bricks is severely felt at Birkenhead and Northwich. At the latter place out of four brickyards working before the war only one survives, and there is at present no output from it, owing to lack of financial backing. At Birkenhead the resettlement of disabled men is to be furthered by a conference between employers and trade unionists.General. There is still no settlement of the vexed question of the shorter working week in the cotton trade. Unrest among the Liverpool dockers continues. The men still refuse to handle beer or spirits and are agitating for a change of hours to allow them to have their drinks at the usual time. At Barrow, shop stewards are active in anticipation of a propaganda campaign by Kirkwood and Murphy in the near future.Northern.Unemployment. Gateshead, Middlesbrough and Consett report increasing unemploy-ment. Newcastle, Sunderland, Jarrow, Darlington and Stockton show decreases. The engineering and ironfounding trades are those most seriously affected. Work for un-employed women is being found in training for dressmaking and in light welding work in connection with motor car bodies, etc.General. The 44-hour week agitation is being kept up by &quot;the skilled unions in the steel works and the bricklayers and bricklayers&apos; labourers, who refuse to work overtime, but there are indications that the labourers would like to break away and resume overtime. The shipyard unions have formed a committee to negotiate the 44-hour week, and at a forthcoming conference the question will be raised at the same time that the consolidation of war advances into district rates is mooted. The agitation is affecting the chemical workers on Tyneside, who have been refused the 44-hour week at a conference at Man-chester.lack of skilled labour, Stourbridge firms dependent on the firebrick industry will be seriously affected if supplies are not increased in the latter industry. There is a shortage -of skilled female labour in the needle and fishing tackle trades at Redditch. At Worcester the glove industry finds it difficult to secure licences to import fine skins from France and Italy and horsehide from America, and the manufacture of porcelain is seriously retarded by the shortage of &quot;coal.The Smethwick Employment Committee finds that certain applicants for employ-ment who are over 65 years of age are incapable of work under ordinary conditions apart from, the exceptional demand for labour created by the war, and suggests that the old-age pension scheme should be made applicable to such cases.
Scotland.Unemployment. Except in Lanarkshire unemployment is increasing, especially at Dundee and Arbroath. Other centres are Glasgow, Paisley, Edinburgh and Aberdeen.. The fall in cotton values is affecting the Paisley mills, and the textile mills at Perth, Alyth and Auchterarder are adopting the alternate week system, as in Dundee. There is, however, a demand for women workers in carpet works at Galashiels. It is hoped to open up sources of employment in Carlisle for workers from Dumfries and Annan. Employ-mentm Grangemouth has been extended in new dye works and cigarette and box-making factories. burnt island is faced with the problem of housing its workers, in view of the demand for houses for the summer season Lodgings for the workers in the new shipbuilding yard are not procurable Reconstruction in the West Highlands is said to depend on increased traffic facilities Immediate action on the use of Highland water power is urged, on the lines of the recommendations of the report of the &quot;Water Power Resources Committee.An increase in the number of disabled men seeking employment is considered to be due to the recent large discharges from hospitals. The Edinburgh Employment Committee suggest the foundation of joint Employment Committees for employers and unionists in each industry to provide light work for such men.General. The housing conditions in the Scottish towns, especially in Glasgow and Edinburgh, are giving rise to increasingly articulate discontent. A sign of the change in. the atmosphere of Edinburgh since 1914 was afforded by a Labour demonstration held on the first Sunday in May, at which the Workers&apos; International Industrial Union was con-spicuous. The Clyde Workers&apos; Committee is now reported to have considerable influence in Rosyth and in the Edinburgh factories. The East Lothian Miners&apos; Association seem to be supporting John Maclean&apos;s agitation for a Scottish Labour College at Glasgow on the lines of the Central Labour College.The engineering and mining industries are still disturbed. The Scottish Mine Managers Association, the Colliery Under-Managers of Scotland, and the Scottish Clerks&apos;Association have met in Glasgow to demand increased salaries and to define their position as regards the coal owners and the mining unions. The Clyde District Committee of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers have decided to stop overtime except for emefgency plant repairs as from the 5th May, the aim being to decrease unemployment.In Dunfermline the workers have objected to the mills running four days a week, as it deprived them of unemployment donation. Under their threat of migration to Ayr and Hawick, the manufacturers have agreed to run the mills three days a week, witli a reversion to full time work shortly.Wales.Unemployment. The situation is most acute in Flint, Carnarvon, Swansea, Newport,, Cardiff and Wrexham, but no serious increase of unemployment is expected if the labour disputes affecting the miners and steel workers at Ebbw vale and the tinplate annealers at Llanelly are settled satisfactorily. Unemployment among women is gradually decreas-ing.   In Carnarvon a good many of the unemployed are slate miners.General. Electricians and building trade operatives engaged in or about collieries are claiming the Sankey 2s. per day and holidays; negotiations are proceeding. At Llanelly the tinplate annealers have withdrawn their notices pending a reference to the Tinplate Industrial Council.Mr. Philip Snowden was the principal speaker at a May Day demonstration at Ponty-pridd, which was supported-by the Miners&apos; Federation and the Labour Party. Reform of the working conditions in mining was demanded, and resolutions were passed against the War with Russia, the treatment of conscientious objectors and the imprisonment of Labour leaders. The South Wales Unofficial Reform Committee is reported to be actively forming &quot; industrial sub-committees &quot; and opening up relations with railway men and transport workers.
Part V-Disputes.((a) Involving a Stoppage of work with reference to the strike of milk farmers in various parts of the country, mentioned last week, an investigation into the summer prices of milk for Lancashire and the Western counties was opened on the 8th May before the Travelling Commission which investigated the cost of production in various parts of the country earlier in the year. At a meeting of the Lancashire Farmers Association at Preston on the 10th May it was decided to resume delivery on the 11th May, the question of prices to remain in abeyance until the return of the deputation now waiting on the Food Controller in London. It was resolved, however, that if the Preston Food Control Committee did not &quot;increase the price from 6d. to %d. per quart, milk supplies would cease on the 18th May. The Food Controller has refused to increase the scale of milk prices for Yorkshire. The situation has become more serious in Cornwall where the County Dairy Association called upon the dairymen to cease delivering on the 12th May until their demand for 2s. a gallon is conceded. A later report, however, states that the strike is already at an end.It is reported that the Swansea dockers who have been locked out for over a month, decided to resume work on the 13th May, under the former conditions of employment. The dispute arose over the employers&apos; interpretation of the shorter working week agreement. The demands of the men are to be considered by the employers and Unions concerned.The strike of annealers at Llanelly, which also involved two Swansea tinplate works, is at an end, the men decided to resume work on the 12th May, leaving the question at issue for settlement at the first meeting of the Industrial Council.A strike of building and allied trades operatives began at Lincoln on the 9th May, owing to the refusal of the Ministry of Labour to ratify an agreement reached between the employers and workmen, fixing a flat rate of Is. 8d. per hour for skilled workers and Is. 5d. for labourers. . The Ministry of Labour is receiving a deputaton of masters and men on Wednesday, 14th May. At this conference the Minister of Labour, while maintaining the right of the Department to scrutinize any departure from decisions taken by the Interim Court of Arbitration, acknowledged that the increase in the cost of living at Lincoln should be taken into account and therefore undertopk to secure a re-hearing of the case by the Interim Court.Some 4,000 colliery workers struck at Llwynypia (Midrhondda) on the 8th May, owing to the slowness of the colliery owners in taking back discharged soldiers. The colliery officials state that they are taking back the ex-soldiers as fast as there are vacancies for them.At Whitburn Colliery, near Sunderland, the miners ceased work on the 5th May, refusing to work with two conscientious objectors, who had been reinstated with the consent of the local Union officials. At a mass meeting held by the men, it was decided that the two men should not keep their jobs.  Work was resumed the next day.With reference to the strike of painters in London for an increase of wages which occurred at the beginning of April, it is reported that they have been awarded the extra 2d. per hour which they demanded, subject to a certain understanding as to work not necessarily to be executed by skilled painters [e.g., distempering, tarring, &amp;c).A dispute has arisen between the Clyde tugboatmen and their employers, with the result that the tugs have ceased working. It is stated that the men are demanding overtime pay for work after 6 pan. on weekdays and 1 pan. on Saturdays:On the 9th May a strike of tugboatmen and men engaged on Isle of Wight steamers occurred at Southampton, the men demanding higher wages and shorter hours. Several liners have been held up in consequence and communication with the Isle of Wight interrupted. The National Maritime Board is stated to have offered shorter hours (72 hours for tugboatmen and 62 for the Isle-of Wight steamer men), but no higher wages. The Company concerned has issued a notice, stating that as their terms have been upheld by the Maritime Board, the places of the men who do not return on the 16th May will no longer be kept open.A strike occurred on the 13th May among the woodworkers at several London aircraft factories, the Aircraft Manufacturing Company, Hendon, and the Handley-Page works.being principally affected. The men have come out to enforce their demand for the withdrawal of all systems of payment by results. During the war the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, the General Union of Carpenters and Joiners, and the Furnishing Trades Associa-tion secured a ten-to-one majority of their members for the abolition of all bonus systems. They decided to take no action, however, until after the war. A later report states that the machinists employed at Handley-Page, Vickers, and the Aircraft Manufacturing Company, joined the strikers on the 14th May.   *ib) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.At a meeting of the General Councils of the United Textile Factory Workers Association at Bolton on the 10th May, it was decided to ballot on the question of tendering notices in support of their claim for a 46-1-hour week and a 30 per cent, advance on the standard price-
list rates. The employers have declined to concede these terms. The present wages agreement is stated to end on the 7th June, and the new arrangement will remain in operation until December.  The ballot papers are to be returned on the 28th May.On the 6th May a conference opened at Westminster, to arrive at an interpretation of an award recently made for the wholesale clothing trade of Yorkshire.
