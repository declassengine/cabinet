AS on many previous occasions, I circulate this note by an able writer in the Foreign Office, not as committing the Foreign Office or the Secretary of State, but as representing the views of an expert authority.&apos; C. of K.Foreign Office,April 28, 1919..[1130-574 a]
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]       /*3DENTIAL Political Intelligence Department,Foreign office.Russia/024.MEMORANDUMRUSSIA IN VIEW OF PEACE: A CONSPECTUS WITH CONCLUSIONS.Outline.THE following memorandum (1) draws attention to an important communication relative to the present state of the Bolshevik Government and the probable form of a new Government which may evolve from it; (2) gives a brief resume of the present political situation in the principal areas comprised within the former Russian Empire, more particularly attempting to estimate recent events in Finland, the Baltic Provinces, Lithuania, and Siberia; (3) draws attention to the probable tendency of the present anti-Bolshevik movements to culminate in the restoration of a monarchy, with the implied assistance towards this end of the Allied Powers ; (4) points out that the recrudescence of Bolshevism, for example, in Siberia, is directly related to fear of such a movement on the part of large elements in the population; (5) suggests that the time has come when, in the interests of a democratic Russia, a clear indication should be given on the part of the Allies that assistance has been, and is, provided with the intention that the future form of Russian Government shall be decided by the people, convened in representative form, and not forced on them by the action of any particular group; and (6) that once this has been done, aid might be given to General Judenitch, provided he undertakes his campaign against Petrograd from the southern side of the Gulf of Finland, at any rate, not from Finland.In connection with the masses of material coming into the Foreign Office on the subject of Russia, nothing perhaps has been more remarkable than the circumstance, that, in spite of all this information, it has really been impossible up to the present moment to be satisfied with regard to the real truth as to the condition of affairs in Russia. Is, for example, General Judenitch correct when he says in effect &quot;Arm and clothe my 15,000 men. I shall then be able to take Petrograd. Regiments of Reds will come over to me, Moscow must inevitably fall as a consequence, and the Bolshevik regime will be over &quot; or, is that other information more accurate, on the basis of which the Prime Minister developed his, argument for the Prinkipo proposal, stating &quot; that the Bolsheviks had an army of 300,000 men, who would, before long, be good soldiers,&quot; to fight whom &quot; at least 400,000 soldiers would be required&quot; ? Much of the information secured by this Office has necessarily been local, and in some cases inevitably coloured by the prepossessions of the informant. Of recent data, I venture to draw attention to the following communication by M. Navaschine, Director of the Moscow Red Cross, which impresses by its distinctiveness and convincing reasonableness* : &quot; Bolshevism in Russia is rapidly losing ground. Many became Bolshevik to save their lives, and having made money, wish to keep it and increase their capital. Communism is giving place to &apos; new bourgeoisie.&apos; Lenin recognises this fact, and is allowing co-operative societies to come into existence and exploit forests, &amp;c. Everybody is prepared to see Lenin and his comrades fall. Kischkine, Minister of the Interior, under Kerensky, considers it necessary to work with Bolsheviks, so as to be ready to step into their shoes, and states that there are already forces ripe to assume succession to Lenin and Trotsky. These are to be found amongst the men who have not left Russia, but have continued to play a practical part in affairs as members of co-operative societies, officials, officers, engineers, &amp;c. All hate Bolsheviks, but there is much distrust of Russian emigres.&quot;Kischkine thinks it would be madness to negotiate with Bolsheviks. Allies ought to send Relief Commissions with food, by distributing which they could become masters of situation. He considers Bolsheviks should not fall too soon, but* It is possible that the writer may seem to put a higher estimate on this particular document than it deserves, but having had opportunities of discussing aspects of the Russian situation with M. Navaschine in Moscow in 1915, 1916, and 1917, he is in a position to gauge the probable value of M. Navaschine&apos;s opinions. &apos;J1130] 574 B     -; -34
that time should be taken to arrange everything with sounder elements in Russia, and to prevent inrush of emigres, who would create chaos and work . to restore monarchy under German auspices.&quot;References will be made to some of these points after a preliminary survey of the state of affairs in the different regions of the late Russian Empire.(a.) Archangel Region.Here, perhaps more than in other region of Russia, has a Local Government been formed which corresponds to, and is really expressive of, the feeling and desires of the mass of the people. That Government is essentially democratic, and compared with the relationships at an earlier stage with the British authorities, the present situation is one of harmony and co-operative understanding/^ The results of this are seen in the field, and while the withdrawal from Archangel and Murmansk would have been the most easily justified from the point of view of combined usefulness both to Russia and to the Allied Powers involved, the present possibility of offering effective assistance through linkage with Koltchak&apos;s forces seems to call for delay in this respect.(b.) Finland.Here the decisive feature has been the recent general election, giving 80 votes to the Socialists and 78 to the bourgeois parties other than the Agrarians, leaving the latter with their 42 votes in the position of holding the balance. This state of affairs is reflected only to a partial extent in the new Government, which is composed of six members of the Progressive Party, four members of the Agrarian Party,t three non-party members and one member of the Swedish Party. The constitutional feature is the extent to which the members of the new Government may still be composed of individuals who are not members of the Diet, and this is the case with five in the present instance. The results of the election have been a bitter, though not unforeseen, disappointment to the Swedish and Old Finn Parties, which comprise the monarchical elements to a large extent. It may be taken as most probable that the constitutional question will be dealt with first, and in the event of the Socialists not proving irreconcileable in the sense of maintaining their demand of 1917 that all power should be vested in the Diet alone, it looks as if the constitution would be settled on a definitely Republican basis, in which case M. Stolberg, president of the Supreme Administrative Court will be called to the Presidency. To judge from their programme, the Socialist members in the present Diet are the most moderate assemblage that have represented that particular party in Finnish parliamentary history, and it is not therefore remarkable that some, at any rate, of the present Ministry are determined to work for reconciliation with that Party. There can be no doubt that this is the line of true wisdom for Finland in the present circumstances, where a Red rising might again only too easily break out. In this connection attention should be directed to the &quot; activist&quot; movements on and across the Finnish borders, which are motived by the desire to take Petrograd and to lay forcible claim to a part, at any rate, of Russian Karelia,. There is no question that General Mannerheiin was partial to the movement on Petrograd, sharing the hope of the monarchical element that by some such coup d&apos;Etat the attention of the country might be transferred from domestic affairs to imperialist ideas, and that in virtue of having taken Petrograd and being able in a spirit of generosity to hand it back again to the Russians, an unanswerable claim could be made on Russian acquiescence in Finnish independence. In connection with this movement German agents have played no inconsiderable part, wishing to share from the beginning in any movement thut had the capture of Petrograd and the re-establishment of Tsarist anti-Bolshevik power as its object, and also hoping j that, as the result of this adventure, trouble would break out in Finland, which would igain give Germany an opportunity of posing as the saviour of that country. The evidence all goes to show that the mass of the Finnish people are opposed to imperialistic ventures of this kind, which would simply be a challenge to a renewed Red rising.   Conscious of this, General Mannerheim no longer proposes* The above statement represents a condensation of views expressed to the writer by M. Tchaikovsky, which hiive been set down at length in more than ore memorandum. It will be understood that reference to M. Tchaikovsky&apos;s implied criticism of earlier relationships means no assent on the part of the writer, but is simply given with the purpose of presenting- this element in the Russian point of view.f The Progressive Party to-day represents the Republican element in the: Young Finn Party, the Monarchical element having gone over to the Old Finns or Coalition Party, as it is now called. It does not,1 however, follow that every Old Finn is a Monarchist.
to employ the Finnish Army, which, as a matter of fact, could not be altogether trusted for such operations, but is leaving the venture to &quot; activist&quot; volunteer forces, whose activities may be disowned in the event of failure.An added complication is the presence of General Judenitch with a force of 2,800 Russians already registered, and the consciousness that he can increase this force to between 6,000 and 7,000 provided he receives Allied assistance in the way of clothing and ammunition. He is convinced that with 15,000 men he could take Petrograd and that Moscow must inevitably fall, and that numerous Red regiments are simply waiting the opportunity to desert to his side. In the event of a decision to assist General Judenitch, it is strongly urged that any operations that he conducts should be under-taken from the Esthonian side of the Gulf or from the Archangel direction; this, of course, will add to his difficulties but is imperative in view of the situation in Finland. The aituation could probably be further helped were the Finnish Government distinctly told that the Karelian question is one for decision by the Peace Conference, and that, as intimated in the case of the Polish-Czecho-Slovak dispute for Teschen, attempts on the side of any party to present the -Conference with a fait accompli will prejudice its claim. Such a step would seem to be more necessary in view of the most recent information which states that German &quot;activists&quot; are spreading the idea amongst the Finnish volunteers that the movement is favoured by the British Government, as an advance against the Russian Reds in Karelia will assist the British forces in Archangel, whilst to the Finnish mind an analogy has also suggested itself between the assistance lent to the Esthonians against the Bolsheviks, and the help that they would like to give to their kinsmen in Karelia against the same enemies.(c.) The Baltic Provinces.Here the outstanding feature has been the coup carried out by the Baltic nobility on the 16th April. Owing to the confusion and contradiction between Articles 12 and 13 of the terms of Armistice between the Associated Powers and Germany, and the practical failure to take steps by the appointment of an Allied Military Mission to see that the terms of the armistice were duly carried out on the East European border, the Germans have had the situation completely in their own hands. It may be taken as a cardinal point that of all the territory that came temporarily into their hands, Courland (capital Mitau) and Livonia (capital Riga). are the two regions which they will surrender with least grace. The prospect of a strong independent Poland, backed by a line of independent Baltic States, cutting them off from physical contact with Russia, has stimulated the Germans into activity. Further, the fact that East Prussia .and Latvia were the cradles of the junker and baronial systems, inevitably suggested them as most suitable environments for the recruiting and drilling of trusted forces* which could eventually be used either to take Poland in the rear and Esthonia to the north, or in the end be employed for reactionary purposes in a further westward march to Berlin. If in command of the through-gates to Russia and the east, Germany could afford to be subservient and surrender ground on her western front. Germany organising control of Russian raw material, offers a greater prospect of future recovery than even any surrendered scheme of colonial expansion.In Latvia the Bait element amounting, including both bourgeoisie and nobility, to some 7 per cent, of the whole population, owns over 60 per cent, of the land. Amongst the Baits there are three parties, of which two---the Baltische-National-Partei and the Baltische-Fortschrittliche-Partei, representing the lower and upper middle classes respectively were, on the whole, content to work patriotically with the Lettish Parties. On the other hand, the Baltenbund comprises, for the most part, the irreconcileable reactionary and pro-German elements in the nobility. It is they who, officering the Baltic forces, which numbered some 3,300,t in active co-operation with the German forces, which exceed 20,000, rounded up and disarmed the Lettish army of 2,000, and arrested the members of the Lettish Provisional Government. This action on the Bait- side was certainly stimulated by fear of the growing strength of the Provisional Government and its avowed programme of Social-Democratic land legislation which involves expropriation with a minimum of compensation. It also expressed their fear of the eventual local supremacy of the Lett, and their own natural inclination to link their future with Germany.   It is apparent that the&quot; whole movement* &quot; Before joining the front-line forces the Germans seem to keep these new arrivals (from Germany) in the rear areas for a certain time. The object apparently is to comb out the Spartacists, who are immediately returned to Germany.&quot; (Major Keenan&apos;s Report of 18th March, 1919.)I This figure probably represents the limits of Bait recruitment.[1130]-574 B 2
is a direct challenge of the principles for which the Entente stand, and demands some sort of an answer if Allied prestige in the Baltic is to be maintained and any control of the relationships between Russia and Germany is to be maintained. There is every, reason to believe that if the Germans were removed, a representative Coalition Government could be formed of bourgeois Baits and the various Lettish elements, which would be truly representative of the mass of opinion and aspiration in the country, and that a national army of 15,000-18,000 could be raised. The principal cause of any tendency towards Bolshevism, at any rate in -the country districts, is the German occupation.In Esthonia, owing to the smaller proportion of the German-Baronial element, the Local Government has been more successful in the maintenance of its position. Here, as in Latvia, owing to the fact that the Germans were in control of the postal arrangements and means of transport, the Provisional Government were at first unable to organise their own army. The German retreat was timed to correspond with the Bolshevik advance, but with Allied assistance the Esthonians have been able to arm and maintain a considerable force in the field. The circumstance that the Lettish Government had no corresponding success in point of view of numbers was mainly due to the fact that their county has never been free of large bodies of German troops. With the further aid of Finnish volunteers and a loan of 20,000,000 Finnish M., the Esthonians succeeded in driving the Bolsheviks completely across their borders. The results of the last election, just to hand, show, however, a marked growth in the Social-Democratic and Labour Parties, and in default of further vigorous assistance, aided by their understanding that the Allied representatives have sought to come to terms with the Bolsheviks, the Esthonian Government has shown signs of wishing to act in a corresponding mariner on the basis of the recognition of its independence by the Bolshevik Government. A further complication has been the presence of the Northern Russian army, of some 3,000 men under Colonel Balahovitch, who have co-operated with the forces of the Esthonian Provisional Government on the understanding that so long as righting took place on Esthonian territory, the force should be under the supreme command of the Esthonian Commander-in-Chief, passing from under his command to that of General Judenitch as soon as Pskov was taken by a conjoint movement, or in the event of the force otherwise finding itself on definitely Russian ground. Hesitancj7 has been shown by the Esthonian Provisional Government in welcoming further additions to this force, and even objection to General Judenitch himself, because of the obscure attitude of the political elements which he represents in relation to the question of. the independence of Esthonia.(d.) Lithuania.In Lithuania the political situation is becoming rapidly consolidated. The most recent advices announce the election of M. Smetona as President of the Republic, and another slight readjustment of the Cabinet involves the return of M. Slizevicius to the Premiership. In the Government as now constituted, all parties are represented with the exception of the Bolsheviks&apos;1&apos; which must undoubtedly tend to consolidation of the Government, and indicates in the same degree the determination of the people to secure their independence. Evidence of the comparatively tolerant attitude of the Taryba is given in a recent communication which states that &quot; Uprava assembly of White Russians of Grodno provinces who number about 72 per cent, of population and which is supported by Jews 17 per cent, of population, voted in July 1918 in favour of union at least for present with Lithuania, and their members sit in Taryba.&quot; This is of profound significance in relation to the attitude of the Poles to Lithuania, which is far from friendly. Encouraged by the French desire for a Greater Poland, the Polish Imperialistic ambition is directed towards various contiguous territories, the incorpora-tion of which with Poland at the present moment would really simply mean a weaker Poland. The Lithuanians, who are of a different race, at present look rather^towards affiliation rather with Latvia, and any premature pressure towards including them in any kind of a Poland will at once be exploited by the Germans, from whose toils the Government is making a vigorous effort to extricate themselves. At the present moment 45,000 German, troops are in occupation of Lithuania, and in very great difficulties the Taryba has assembled a force of roughly 10,000 men, and their combined efforts have resulted in the expulsion of the Bolsheviks from more than half of the country. Cut off from all communication with the Allied world and in desperate need, the Taryba was forced to conclude a loan for 100,000,000 M. with, the German Govern-ment some months ago, to which no political conditions were attached, although the* Mr. Grant Watson reports that &quot; the country is relatively free from local Bolshevism.&quot;
whole income of the State was pledged as security. With Allied aid in the form ot clothing, arms, and munitions, and firm handling of the German and Polish Imperialists-by a local Allied military mission, Lithuania&apos; gives every promise of being a stable element &quot;in the cordon of Baltic States, whose ultimate political relationship should in no way be foreclosed at this stage. According to the latest information, the Polish-Lithuanian relations show signs of improvement.(e.) The Ukraine.In the Ukraine the succession of events follows more or less the same order, if always just a little later, that has characterised events in other regions of Russia. The pro-German Hetman Skoropadski having been overthrown, the more nationalist elements under Vinnichenko and Petlura gained the upper hand and with active French assistance there seemed some chance of a repetition of the satisfactory conditions in Archangel region. Under the compulsion of famine, however, the Bolsheviks moved in force towards the south, and, as the result of Allied lack of policy, unity of action against them did not eventuate. Odessa was evacuated on the 6th April, and the French headquarters retired to Akkerman. The Crimea is now practically in Bolshevik hands. Already, however, signs of a reaction, helped by the general weakening of the Bolshevik position throughout Russia, are in evidence, and Kieff is reported to be once again in the hands of the Ukrainians. Fantastic as is the idea of the Ukraine .as an absolutely independent Slav State, its claim to individuality as a unit in a Russian Federation is probably now sufficiently attractive to the minds of the majority of its inhabitants to cause some trouble in later readjustments.(f.) The Caucasus and Adjacent Regions.Of the districts definitely considered Ciscaucasian, the Don and Kuban Cossack territories, comprising roughly the area of influence of Denikin&apos;s volunteer army, are regions where the effort towards self-determination, although far from non-existent, has, under the circumstances of the case, had latterly little opportunity of development. The situation is otherwise with the Trans-Caucasian regions, including Daghestan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia, where the spirit of independence in varying degrees, of strength has at times afforded more of a challenge to Denikins activities than the Bolshevik front to the north and north-west of him. The latest indications still tend to suggest that with the firm advice and assistance of a competent and defensible mandatory these different States can develop into a condition in which their national aspiratidns will be satisfied, without again at the same time foreclosing the question of their ultimate return into a federation of Russian States.(g.) Siberia.The situation in Siberia is at once the most hopeful, but in other respects the most problematic in the elements constituting the late Russian Empire. Koltchak&apos;s recent, brilliant successes on his front are neutralised to a certain extent by the growing unrest in his rear. In P.I.D. Memorandum, Russia 014, the writer gave historical and economic reasons for the contention that in Siberia of all places in the distinctively Slav regions of the Russian Empire, Bolshevism would have least success. Such a measure of success cannot latterly be denied, and must therefore be due to accidental, rather than to intrinsic, causes. The chief of these, for the economic reasons in this case are subsidiary, arise from the conditions under which Admiral Koltchak came into power, and the consequent conversion of social revolutionaries into Bolsheviks, owing to the local belief that the ultimate aims of Koltchak&apos;s entourage, if not of himself, are monarchical and reactionary, and (although this admits of answer) that he is aided by the Allies with this purpose in view. The most recent telegrams refer to the fact that &quot; over 90 per cent, of the burgher population and 80 per cent, of Russian peasants are co-operators, loosely associated with the Right wing of the Socialist Revolutionary Party,&quot; who &quot; greatly resent the indifference to public support shown by Koltchak&apos;s Government, especially [? Labour], and more particularly condemn Rinov policy of attack on all representative institutions, which is doing greatest harm.&quot; They are, however, represented as &quot; in no way objecting to recognition of Koltchak&apos;s Government by us as long as it is conditional on his taking a broader public basis.&quot; A further element in the situation arises from the more or less undisguised Japanese attitude of self-interest in Siberia. This throughout, under cover of all manner of moves, has been directed towards preventing harmonious action on the part of the Allies in the interests of the self-recovery of R-ussia.   One of tneir principal lines of activity has been
i    uuumwuwi, &quot;ii,n i.......HiiiiiimiMMtomniiiii,,,^/^..........^-tiM^Mit^iAii;:. laai.;.-,,;,-............-,,......A,,).1,,-,)______................ .........the development of &quot; Atamanschina,&quot; that is, support of local centres of authority as, e.g., under Semenoff, Horvat, and others. The Allied action in attempting to bring about reconciliation between Koltchak and Semenoff has been up to now thwarted by the Japanese, who have their alternative plan for more definite control of other ^Russian leaders like Horvat, in the East, should such reconciliation come about in the West.At a time when decisions have to be made, therefore, the recent proposal of His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner at Vladivostock, that the Omsk Government should now be recognised as a Provisional Government for Siberia, seems to have every justification. Such recognition would give Koltchak some more exact idea of where he stands in relation to the Allies; it will make it more difficult for the Japanese to promote the encouragement of other political centres of government under ambitious leaders; and it will give Koltchak and his troops that external stimulus of enhanced prestige which may make all the difference in encouraging them to endure.* Recognition as the Provisional Government for Siberia would postpone the difficult question of the relation of the Omsk Government to the various non-Slav border States.General Conclusions.We started from the assumption justified by the references to the opening paragraph that the Bolshevik phase of Russian history is passing away. One thing, however, the Bolsheviks have done ; they have ploughed deeply into the consciousness of the people, and the seed of rebellion against constituted authority, should that take the form of oppression, has now a strong and permanent lodgment. Henceforward the Russian people are unlikely to adopt a servile attitude to any Government that offends against their sense of liberty.Within the past five years the -Allies have had experience of a Czarist Russia, of a Democratic Russia, and of a Bolshevik Russia, and the opinion may be held that of these three, so far as the future is concerned, Democratic Russia is the most likely to,provide the best conditions for her self-development and to offer the maximum of helpfulness and safety to her Allies. Responsible Russians are prepared to prove that it alone was absolutely loyal to the Allies. Even if in some way or another, a monarchy were introduced even on constitutional lines, the writer believes that it would only be a temporary phenomenon, and the signal for renewed revolution, sooner or later.. The only direction in which the idea has attraction now for the peasant would be as a symbol of something that would give him security in his possession of the land, and if that can be otherwise provided, the appeal of Czarism is certainly weakened. It should also carefully be borne in mind that it is under a Czarist regime that the best opportunity would be afforded for a linkage of the&quot; reactionary elements in Russia with the reactionary elements in Germany and Japan, and that most of the Russian military elements under whose guidance the present successes are being achieved are frankly and naturally monarchist in outlook. The practical conclusion from these considerations is that, while giving all possible assistance as e.g. by the recognition of Koltchaks Government, for the re-establishment of order, there should be a clear understanding that whatever form of Government may be the final choice of the Russian people, must be decided by them convened in a representative assembly as a whole, and not forced on them as the ambition and design of a particular clique. It is difficult to state in what practical degree the Allied Governments have interfered in Russian internal affairs, whatever their theoretic attitude to this matter, but in view of the widespread feeling amongst the masses of Russian people, that support is heing given to the anti-Bolshevik armies in the field with a view to the reintroduction of a monarchical system, it would seem that the time is opportune for a distinct declaration of the terms on which assistance has been and is being afforded to the various Russian anti-Bolshevik elements. This, perhaps, might be most successfully adjusted by a declaration of policy in relation to the non-Slav Border&apos; States, whose passion for independence has a very marked relation to the degree in which they fear the return of a centralised Russian monarchical system. As Professor Yoldemar, the Lithuanian Foreign Minister, remarked to the writer :&apos;&quot; The Great Russian is willing to allow a distinct measure of political and cultural autonomy to the various non-Slav nationalities, who are, however, in the last resort, to be governed by a centralised committee or institution composed of Great Russians alone. What he is totally unable to imagine is that in that centralised authority there should be representatives of these non-Slav nationalities themselves.&quot; The extreme form of such a Government was, of course, the old autocracy.* The v/riter understands that M. Savinkoff has recently expressed the opinion that Koltchak can hardly reach Moscow before the autumn.
