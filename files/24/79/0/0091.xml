Roos-Keppel reports -that our success at Dakka on 17tlx May has strongly influenced Afridi opinion in our favour after it had been veering round to Jehad on 16th under influence of apparent Afghan success. Mohmandsare ostentatiously friendly. Every district and agency in North-West Frontier Province reports that all well and Peshawar City is quiet. In continuation of our telegram dated 18th May, Roos-Keppel reports that success 17th May also had good effect on Khyber Bifles of whom more wished to stay. But Roos-Keppel after full&quot;&apos;consultation with Political Agent and officers considers that Corps can no longer be relied on in present strained state of religious feeling. It is, therefore, being disbanded and only 200 or 300 men are. being kept to carry on political work as messengers. Following telegram from British Agent, Kabul, dated 11th May was found in British Agent&apos;s mail bag on body of dead Afghan mail runner: &quot; Yesterday evening I had three hours&apos; straight and frank talk with Minister. The Minister, who was terrified at the reported results of aerial bombardment, in which Saleh Muhammad Sipah Salar was wounded, and 25 men were killed, admitted his ignorance of practical politics, acknowledged the gross mistake committed by Amir and in repentant mood asked me to save situation, guide him and enter into certain preliminary understandings. I advised him to give his repentance practical shape by recalling all. the troops at once, suppressing all inflammatory propaganda, restoring by word and deed the friendly traditions of the past and referring to my Government by safe opportunity (later on ?) effecting a mutual understanding. He promised me an interview with the Amir and our removal from confinement. 1 saw Foreign Minister yesterday. I insisted on a personal interview with the Amir, but he hesitated over this. Sudden arrival of alarming news caused Amir to call Minister urgently which caused my interview to be broken off suddenly. On my return we were all confined under guard to premises entirely cut off from outer world. Official, reason given by Minister for confinement was alarm caused by British in bombardment of forces at Dakka and assured us satisfactory treatment. Details follow.&quot;We have to-day received copy of manifesto found at Thai issued by provisional Government of India under signature of Obaidulla, Wazir, and seal of Faquir Hassan, Secretary.   It is couched in most violent terms, and following is typical extract :-1  The provisional Government has entered into compact with invading forces. Hence, you should not destroy your real interests by fighting against them, but kill English in every possible way, do not help them with men and money and continue to destroy rails and telegraph wire. Earn peace at the hands of attacking armies, and obtain sanads of honour by supplying them with provisions.&quot;Baluchistan repeat report from Kamar-ud-din-Karez, dated 12th May, that Afghan Governor of Wazikhwah, in Sulemankhal country, has received orders that all must prepare for Ghaza, that rifles and ammunition were to be issued to those who had none, and if people did not go willingly every second man has to be taken by force.
