.     WAR   CABINET. CENSORSHIP OF CABLES AND- &quot;&apos;. TRELESS * Note by Lord. Robert Cecil.?rim Minister..I venture to. submit that the time has come for the removal Of the censorship on cables and wireless between the United If.ingd.om and the rest of Europe and America,     In view of the disturbed conditions in Xiidia and Egypt it may be necessary to maintain the censorship with regard, to the Eastj   though even there it should be removed at the earliest possible moment*The question was discussed at the Cabinet uhon I was last in England in the presence of Sir A. Ged&amp;es (Board of Trade), Mr. Cecil Harmsworth (Blockade)j ilr,&apos; ?alter Long and the C,I,G,S,     After hearing the various views represented by these gentlemen, the Cabinet came to the conclusion that, but for one political consideration with which Mr, Balfour is familiar, the censorship might be removed.     But in the absence of the Prime Minister they did not like to overrule the arguments founded on that consideration, and they therefore left it to him to decide on any submission I might make on the subject.     I understand from Mr, Balfour that he thinks that in existing circum.st?,nces the arguments referred to are ill-founded.The commercial reasons for removing the censorship are very strong and were urged not only by me but by Sir A, Geddes and Mr, Chamberlain also.    &apos;There is.a controversy as to how far the censorship does actually delay cables.     But there is no doubt it does so sometimes and it causes an immense amount of irritation and uncertainty which is extremely prejudicial to the revival of confidence and normality on which all trade depends.Much has been said about the Importance of censorship to the blockade.     I believe this aspect of- the matter has always been exaggerated,     I doubt very much if the censorship contributed 5&apos;* to the efficiency of the blockade at any time. Under present conditions its blockade value is negligible.     It was useful to support the black lists, but the black lists )      have been suspended.SECRET. G.T.,7242..It acted/
It acted as a check on the trustworthiness of individual guarantees against re-export,&apos; but individual guarantees have disappeared.   The really effective blockade weapons are at present the direct naval and military action so far as enemy ports are concerned, and- for. indirect trade with the enemy the rationing of - neutrals, &apos; Without rationing no other safeguards,however elaborate are really satisfactory; for the leakage from the neutrals will always be considerable And this will true even with rationing, so long as the neutral countries possess stocks and resources more than sufficient for their needs.   That is no longer the case. -The neutrals nowadays depend on imports almost from day to day to keep themselves going, and so long as these imports are rationed down to their strict necessities there is no danger that they will allow any exports to Germany -particularly as they are no longer afraid of her.Rationing therefore, apart from direct naval and military action,should be our sole and sufficient blockade weapon whenever we desire to exert blockade pressure.   And rationing is entirely independent of censorship.     On blockade grounds there is therefore no season for maintaining the telegraphic censorship.    The Cabinet accepted this view, and.I asked fur its removal.British Delegation, Paris, April 28th, 1919.(SD.) ROBERT CECIL,I agree with this paper.(INTD).   A.J.B.III Prime Minister accepts Mr.Balfour&apos;s decision ontho point.(INTD) . P.ILK.
