From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 18th May 1919. Clear the line.Secret. Your telegram 2012 dated .16th May. Commander-in-Cliiel:&apos;s letter was addressed to Political Agent, Khyber. Text (already telegraphed by Renter) was as follows : -&quot;(R.) Sir, As regards outbreak of war between Afghanistan and Britain, I have the honour to inform you that British officers commenced an unlawful war without any declaration of war on any side and by this aggressive step indicted heavy losses on civil population and Army of Afghanistan by throwing bombs from aeroplanes. I am informed by His Majesty (the King of the Independent Kingdom of Afghanistan) that His Majesty has received a letter from His Excellency the Viceroy of India and in consequence of that I am ordered to suspend war (thus unlawfully begun by your side) until further orders. Yon aro accordingly informed that war has been suspended until final decision has been reached by correspondence between His Afghan Majesty and His Excellency the. Viceroy.   Detailed.   .   .   .&quot;As this insolent message was so palpably devised to gain time (vide our telegram of 16th May), Political Agent was instructed to reply that he was not authorised to answer it and that if Amir wanted peace he should address Viceroy through the General Officer Commanding of Operations.Amir&apos;s letter dated 10th May was received yesterday in Peshawar. Rough trans-lation has been telegraphed ahead by Roos-Keppel. It is very obscure and corrupt in parts, but general character is clear from following salient passages : &quot; Tar ShalVs arrest would be unreasonable and inadvisable when all India and Musulmans are united against tyrannical laws of the Government of India, and Afghans especially on the frontier, are in sympathy with them. . Possibly he may have got papers printed somewhere and my seal may be on them. You are (corrupt group) I have stirred up Afghans. They have combined spontaneously. 1 am astonished at your great delay in replying to my first letter and that your answer should have been one which did not rejoice my heart. The state of affairs has become very dangerous. It is your duty to remove tyrannical treaties, to remove tyrannical laws and to bear in mind the independence of Afghanistan.&quot;   Amanulla&apos;s complicity is beyond doubt.Following from Roos-Keppel, dated 16th May :-&quot;Four letters from Amir Amanulla, dated 9&apos;tli Shaban, equal to 10th May, intercepted. First is to llaji Sahib Turangzai, promising help in troops and ammunition. Second from Amir inviting to Kabul Kazi Abdul Wali, a Peshawar agitator, recently a leading member of .the Peshawar Bolshevist Committee, who escaped to independent territory before city was surrounded. Third to Afghan Postmaster ordering him to send letter number one to the Haji by same means as employed by Afghan Envoy. Fourth, copy of a letter to Afghan Envoy, Abdur Rahman Khan, acknowledging the receipt from him of two letters from Haji Turangzai and commending Afghan Envoy&apos;s services in Peshawar. As already reported, Afghan Envoy had intimate dealings with Bolshevist Committee during his short stay here; original letters are being posted to you to-day. Among contents Afghan Envoy&apos;s post bag, which has been intercepted, is a letter from Foreign Commissary, dated 28th April, ordering him to obtain deeds of allegiance to Amir from Hindus and Mussulmans, saying that Afghanistan is determined to back India and asking him to put excitement in newspapers as good opportunity is drawing near. Post bag contained numerous&apos; copies of inflammatory leaflets for distribution.&quot;
