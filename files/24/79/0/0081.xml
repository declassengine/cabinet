His Bntam&quot;&apos;- r- ; -       Government.300From Viceroy, 18th May 1919.Afghanistan. Koos Keppel reports, 17th May, that owing to alarming increase of desertions in Khyber 1 fines he directed Commandant to concentrate men at Landi Kotal and Jamrud and ask them individually whether they wished to remain or receive discharge. Out of 100 at Landi Kotal GOO elected discharge, and similar result is expected at Jamrud. Though this practical disbanchnent of Khyber Rifles will have adverse effect on Afridis as a tribe, there is considerable difference between tribe, steadied by greybeards, being left to sit on fence and young men in Khyber Rifles being called upon to light for us.Thus Roos Keppel to-day reports decision of Afridi jirga(s) not to move until supplied with arms and ammunition and rations by Amir, and expects their attitude to turn on result of fighting round Dakka, which they are closely watching. Orakzais are adopting much the. same attitude, seeming fairly typical of tribes as a whole. Mohmands, who are reported to have lodted Afghan camp thoroughly of rifles. &amp;c, after bombing of Dakka, are quiet, and have sent messages to Haji Turangzai that they will oppose him. if he tries to come through their country. Political Agent, Wano, reports situation normal; allowances are being distributed. Nawab of Dir is keeping Swatis fully occupied. Fifteen Zhob Militia cavalry, mostly Ghilzais, have deserted from near Akhtarzai.
