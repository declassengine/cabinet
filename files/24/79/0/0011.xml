Secret. Afghanistan. ? reports Amir&apos;s firman is undoubtedly genuine and yesterday Afghan postmaster arrived ? from ? with motor-car load of extremely violent printed leaflets ? with ? on the English. On 5th May three regiments of Afghan troops with two guns arrived at Bagh and others are reported to be following. ? have authorised despatch of troops from Peshawar to object Afghans from Bagh. Three regiments and two ? have left ? for ? country with large Kunarlashkars under ?. Nadir ?, late C.-in-C. with further troops and tribal lashkars, including, several thousand ChilZais, has arrived in ?host and Turis of Kurram are in state of panic. Reports received from British Agent, Kabul, make it clear that ?oople is profoundly dissatisfied with Amanulla enquiry into the murder of Habibulla and suspicion of Amanulla&apos;s own complicity are real cause of Amir&apos;s anti-British policy. Amanulla finding his position untenable and encouraged by grossly exaggerated accounts of disturbances in India,, has been driven, to avert rebellion against himself by proclaiming Jehad and promising easy conquest of India. A most important factor will be the attitude of the tribes, and Roos-Keppel has been authorised to spare no money in securing their adhesion. Lohmands have already approached him, promising to side with us, giving hostages for their good, faith, provided that we will (support?) them with, troops. Roos-Keppel has been instructed to give them necessary assurances.

Baluchistan reports no information of the firman having been sent I to Kandahar and no evidence of feeling against us on that border.
