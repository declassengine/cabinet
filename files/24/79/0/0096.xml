HIS D0CU3MT IS THS PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVEHNMEKT*j( - VAR CABINET.G,T. 7296.SUPPLY OP BI5SR.Memorandum &quot;by Lord D*Abernon*tThis Memorandum was prepared for the Liquor Restrictions Committee) - 1, Prom representations which I have received and enquiries which I have made I mm satisfied that the shortage of beer is so pronounced that immediate steps ought to be taken to relieve it.     The shortage has, I believe, been even more acutely felt since the date of the Chancellor * a Budget Speech, notwithstand-ing the announcement then made of the allowance by the Govern-ment of a substantial increase in the output.2. The shortage is due to a variety of causes, some ofwhich may be temporary, but it has been aggravated during the past two or three weeks by two factors, the influence of whioh will rather increase than diminish during the next few months, namely, the advent of summer, coupled with the unprecedented^ large number of people moving about, both in town and country, with plenty of money in their pockets.3. The restriction of the output of Beer has never formed part of the Central Control Board&apos;s policy, and I believe that the beer-famines, with their attendant rush-drinking, which are the result of present conditions may become a danger to nation-al sobriety and public order.    With the present means of distribution, and with the removal of the sense of restraint upon individual drinking caused by the war, it appears impossi-ble to regulate equitably distribution to the consumer so as to obviate this danger, and I therefore recommend that there should be a further relaxation of the present limitation Upon output.4. What the extent of this relaxation should be is a some-what difficult question.     On the one hand, I feel that, as with the relaxation of other war-time restrictions, we should not go too, abruptly.   On the other hand, I believe that the con-ditions during the coming summer will probably be such as not only to warrant, but also to require in the public interest, a relaxation on a larger scale than the Government thought sufficient only a few weeks ago.   I therefore suggest that, subject to any observations which the Pood Controller may desire to offer, the Government should sanction the principle of a bulk supply equal to the pre-war figure (say 36, or 37 million bulk barrels).   This would involve the authorisation of pn annual output of rather more than 26milHsn standard barrels, if it may be assumed that the beer will actually be brewed at one permitted average gravity of 10400.   Expert opinion, however, seems to anticipate that this gravity will not be reached for some time, and since 24 million standard barrels at 10360 (a gravity substantially higher than the figure permitted up till quite recently) would produce 36 2/3 million bulk barrels, I suggest that for the moment the relaxation should be limited to an additional four millions.   I recommend that this increase ^ I W        should be announced without avoidable delay.5* Such a recommendation appears in harmony with thegeneral policy sketched in the Chancellor&apos;s Budget Speech, and I assume therefore that the beer-duty would be automatically increased pari passu as there foreshadowed.(Signed)   LJAEERN0N,21st May, 191Q,
