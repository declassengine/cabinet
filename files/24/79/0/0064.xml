The Regulation is the only legal authority under which land in or near urban districts or towns can be compulsorily acquired for allotments in this country.2.   The allotments movement was from its inception taken up very earnestly by residents and workers in Irish urban areas.3.   While a knowledge of the existence of the Regulation induce *ed many occupiers of lands in or adjoining urban districts to let their lands voluntarily for allotment purposes, the Department were obliged in 1918 to acquire compulsorily ft total area of 329 acres for these purposes, and in the current year, under threat of the exercise of similar compulsion, the Department prevailed upon the owners of the greater portion of these lands to let them for the 1919 season to local authorities.4*  When the Department, after public enquiry conducted on their behalf by in Inspector of the Local Government leara, take a parcel ef land under sub-section     11^ e,; it is their practice-te ^authorise the 1 eca 1,5ftutherii^So make use of the land in allotments for one senaon unier .an approved scheme* *
5f    With the revocation df this Regulation the Deport-mentf8 powers to secure land for allotments will disappear-^ and the holders of plots on lands acquired under the Regulation must surrender their allotments at the end of the 1910 season,,    A similar condition will arise in the case of allotment holders on lands whose owners, purely as an emergency war measure, consented to let their lands voluntarily.G.    Associations of plot holders have sent many deputations to the Department urging the need of legis-lation for Ireland to come into effect before the Defence of the Realm Regulation is revoked.7,    The Department have already informed the Government that they hope, to submit at an early date suggestions for an Allotment Act for this countrys    As, however, it is . necessary, in order to obviate serious dissatisfaction arising from any-Interruption of the work, that such an Act should come Into force during the present summed,   1 if the Regulation were cancelled, and as it is not probable in view of the pressure of business in Parliament t^at the contemplated Act can be obtained in time, the Department desire that the compulsory powers conferred on them by Regulation 2L for acquiring lands for allotments in Ireland should be continued until, say, November, 1920. It is hoped by that time the desired Act?will have come into operation. ;.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.) -     Hugh T. Barrie.Vice-President.The Secretary,Home Affairs Committee, &apos;&quot;&apos;ar Cabinet,London. S/7tl.
