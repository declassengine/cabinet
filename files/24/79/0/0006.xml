HIi-,DOc/"to :T 13 THE PRfWITY OF HI&apos;&apos;  i-^ ITALIC W*JE&amp;TY&apos;  GOV*/WCTT)/G R I: T . &quot; 22WAR CABINET.T. 7206.Ei:i-Giuv. i.ivD burial f^t^ecb.Memorandum from Sir Arthur Steel-Ma it land1.The Belgian Government through the Belgian Minister have put forward the request that they should be accorded the benefit of any tariff preference given to this country by the Dominions; or to the Dominions by this country, and they are now urgently pressing for a reply.   Other points are also raised, which, however, are either subordinate to, or distinct from, the foregoing.Among the considerations which affect the question- are the following:-(a) The Belgian Government neither suggests nor excludes a reciprocal grant of preference by Belgium to British products.   In corversa-tion, however, with Belgian representatives the view war: ex-pressed that Belgiiv&quot; would be ready to five, such a preference.(b) Other Allies, such as Poland, Serbia and Roumania, whose territories have been ravaged by the war might claim similar treatment.(c) The competition of Belgium with the United kingdom once her factories have been fully rehabilitated, would, be somewhat felt incertain trades, e.g. iron and steel and. glass.   An examination, however, of the trades affected In detail indicates that evenin normal times the amount of competition would be comparatively small, and. during the next few years, i.e., until Belgian pro-duction was rehabilitated, would be reduced to a minimum.   A similar possibility of competition is true of the textile industry of Poland, but would, not be true oi* Serbia and Roumania.(d) As regards the Dominions, manufacturing industries in Canada might be slightly affected.   Otherwise raw materials alone are concerned, and of these sugar is the only one likely to be of importance.(e) In a more recent note, the Belgian Government press for en early reply and state as their reason for so doing that the French have approached, them pressingly with a view to concluding close working arrangements in most branches of economic life-   No information is available as to the precise nature of the pro-posals, but it is certain that if any such convention is con-cluded under which the French exercise an influence over Belgian economic policy   it will be to the detriment of British interests *In confidential conversation, P. de Ramaix, Counsellor of t:.e Belgian Legation, and M. Renkin have /
have stated frankly, that it was felt that Belgium must lean on some great Power.   They do not want that Power to he Prance, and they prefer the United Kingdom to the United States,   M,Renkin stated definitely that he would be glad to see an eventual Customs Union of Belgium and the United Kingdom,(f) Public feeling in Belgium is at the present moment very sore and they feel that their Interests have not been sufficiently considered by the groat Powers of the Entente.   A step of the nature desired would cement Belgian friendship to this country.(g) As regards the legal aspect of the question, exceptional treatment of the nature desired by Belgium is inconsistent with the British interpretation of the most favoured nation clause, in commercial treaties.   It may however ^e held, with force, that the exceptional condition of Belgium warrants exceptional temporary treatment.   If, however, it is desired to accord it, it probably constitutes a greater deviation from our existing treaty obligations than has already been intimated in our cir-cular to foreign countries of June 1918 and tacitly acquiesced in by them..   It will therefore be necessary either to take the highest legal advice whether a new circular should be issued announcing the temporary extension of our practice, or to denounce cur commercial treaties as the Prsnch have done.It is desired to know whether the Cabinet are preparedto grdnt the Belgian request, provided(a) the legal difficulty can be surmounted.(b) the Dominions, on subsequent consultation are also prepared to assent.Department of Overseas Trade, 73, Basinghall Street, E * C &apos; 2. 6th May, 1919.
