This Document la the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;3 Government).&apos;   WAR CABINET,ret.63.&quot;Herring Fishing Industry&quot;.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture and fisheries and. the Secretary for Scotland.1. A deputation representative of the herring industry inIGreat Britain, has submitted to us the present critical position of that industry, and has applied for Government assistance in the form of a guaranteed price for herrings to be cured during the coming season.2. Tho demobilisation of fishermen and vessels has provided the means of conducting the great summer herring fishing this year upon a considerable scale..  Most of the catch of such a fishing must necessarily be cured, i .0. pickled in brine.   The curers state, however, that they will be unable to finance the business beyond a certain point.3. With a big catch the herring fishing must find an outlet for most of its produce in the export trade.   The very restricted catch of recent years has mostly been consumed at home in the form of fresh herrings, kippers and bloaters.   In a normal year, however, home consumption represents only a small fraction of the whole, and this year it will probably not exceed 120,000 crana or about one-fifth of the estimated catch.4. The relatively small home trade in fresh herrings,kippers, and bloaters during the war has been very remunerative to the classes engaged in it, namely, the &quot;freshers&quot; and &quot;kipperers&apos; and the limited number of fishermen who have been left in civil employment.5. The present crisis affects, however, a different and much larger body of men, namely, the exporters and curers who are dependent on the export trade, and the great numbers of fishermen who have been demobilised, chiefly from naval service.
It is estimated that, if curing can he financed, the summer fishing prosecuted.off the coasts of Scotland and the north coasts of England from May to September is capable of yielding 500,000 or 600,000 barrels of pickled herrings, after supplying the home market with, all the fresh herring, kippers, and bloaters which it can be expected to consume.In order to pay the fisherman a fair price for fresh herrings and to pickle them it is estimated that the curer will have to expend about  3 a barrel.   Hence a cure of 600,000 barrels will mean an expenditure of  1,800,000.The curers state that, in the present uncertainty of thei foreign markets, they are unable to undertake this responsibility without a guarantee by the Government against possible loss.   They will probably be able to dispose of 100,000 barrels to the United States and smaller markets. But great uncertainty prevails at present respecting the two main markets, Russia and Germany, to which, in ordinary times about 85$ of the cured herrings would go.Before the war, the cure re used to make sales to Russian and German customers during the progress of the fishing.   The funds thus obtained enabled them to finance further operations during the summer Pishing and subsequently during the autumn Fishing conducted from Yarmouth and Lowestoft in.October and November.The curers can have no assurance at present that such procedure will be practicable this year.   They might therefore be compiled, with such aid as they could obtain from the Banks, to go on sinking more and more money&apos;in stocks, without any returns except for relatively small sales to the U.S.A., etc.They state that they cannot finance operations under the conditions and on the scale mentioned above, unless they areenabled
enabled,- by a guarantee from the Government, to realise their stocks and repay advances from the Banks at the 15th September. That date is chosen as marking approximately the termination of the Scottish fishing&apos;.   The financial resources of the curers are further restricted at present by the fact that they have money tied up in Russia to an amount approaching  500,000..12. If the fishing is to proceed preparations have nowto be made on an extensive scale .   The curers have to engage male and female workers, to. provide barrels, salt, and other materials,, and to put their stations into working order.. The fishermen have-to get ready their boats and gear, and to arrange for coals, oil,, stores, etc.13.     &apos; The whole trade is naturally desirous that the presentyear should see the industry re-established on something like its old basis.   The curing trade, which has been largely in abeyance in recent years, wishes to lose no opportunity of re-entering foreign markets.   For the sake of the fishermen, especially those who have been recently demobilised, there is a general desire that unemployment should not be prevalent.14. There is serious apprehension that, failing a definiteoutlet for the cured herrings by a given date, the curers will soon cease to buy from the fishermen on any considerable scale . The result would be that the fishing would collapse and the fishermen be thrown out of employment.   In that event they would doubtless claim Out-of-Work Donation.   Moreover the home consumer would be deprived of the anticipated cheap supply of fresh herrings, kippers, and bloaters.15. To meet this situation a Committee representative ofall sections of the trade have submitted to us proposals whichare set out in the annexed Memo.The two main proposals are briefly(a)   Until the 15th September, 1919, the curers and exporters to have the fullest opportunity to dispose of their pickled herrings in any available markets.
(b)   At the 15th September the curers to have the option to sell their remaining stocks to the Government at prices varying according to quality and averaging about  3 per barrel.A third proposal under which an advance of 75$ of thevalue of stocks could be obtained from the Government need notbe further considered.   If the proposal (b) received effectcurers ought to have no difficulty in securing any necessaryadvance from a Bank.16. The curers claim that the guaranteed prices referredio in (b) are only reasonably sufficient to reoompense them for their outlays and services after allowing a fair price to the fishermen for the &quot;green&quot;, i.e. fresh fish.   If numerous ohanoes all turn out favourably they reckon that the guaranteed price might leave them a profit of   4/- per barrel (covering their own services).   If, however, some of the circumstances are unfavourable, e.g. if the catch generally or locally is small or irregular or if the cost of labour rises, the possible pro-fit will disappear or be converted into a loss.17. If the main continental markets, especially Russia,should re-open during the next few months the curers have a chance of a good profit.   In these circumstances there is no doubt that every effort will be made to dispose of the goods in the ordinary way without recourse to the proposed guarantee. But the curers, or most of them, are not in a position to con-tinue to wait beyond the 15th September for this possibility to mature, unless by the autumn the outlook has become much clearer.   They ask therefore that at the 15th September, 1919, they should have an option to transfer to the Government their risk on their remaining stocks.18. We realise that a proposal of this character andmagnitude cannot be accepted without strong justification.We
V.o aro of opinion, however, that it should ho accepted by the Government for the folio-, ing reasons:-(l) The apprehensions that the groat summerherring fishing will collapse failing such a guarantee or access,to the Russian and Gorman markets are, in our view, well founded,(2) There is every -prospect that the Russianmarket will recover sooner or L?.ter but recovery during the next few months cannot be counted on.(3) The possibilities of sale to Germany areobscure.     The difficulties will certainly be great. ..e understand that there is little prospect of trade with Germany, otherwise than through the German Government, and that the latter cannot be compelled to take herrings as part of their supplies of food. The German Government have n great advantage in any negotiations in that the Norwegian Government is trying to sell them enormous accumulated stocks of over 2,000,000 barrels,     Germany can thus play one competitor off against the other and Norway has the advantage of -holding stocks whereas the British supplies are only prospective.(4) Our   pre-war supremacy in Continential markets - forpickled herrings is seriously challenged by neutral countries, especially Norway,     Our position isprejudiced (a) by the virtual suspension of our export trade during recent years (b) by the simultaneous expansion of the.Norwegian fisheries.By making large purchases of pickled herrings in norway and &quot;by restricting her exports to germany the British Government has in fact subsidised theNorwegian herring industry and assisted it tobecome a most formidable competitor.     Good reasonsif
of oourse existed for this policy of purchase and Blockade.At the same time, tho prejudicial effect on our own fisheries has to he remembered and remedied so far as practicable.     A part of the stocks which the Norwegian Government is now endeavouring to sell to Germany consists in fact of herrings bought by the British Government in Norway and recently sold to the Korwer;i^n Government.(5) The Norwegian Government has, it is understood,assisted the Norwegian herring industry during the war, upon a scheme similar to that of the proposed guarantee.(6) If the British herring fishing collapses the mainsufferers will be fishermen who have been demobilised after rendering invaluable service in the naval forces. Including shore-workers about 12,000 men and women are involved.     If they become unemployed there will be a heavy claim for Out-of--v,ork Donation.     The discontent inevitably caused by the unemployment of demobilised men will also be engendered,(7) The homo market depends for its cheap supplies of fresh and smoked fish on the maintenance of the foreign trade.(0) This is an emergency measure designed to tide animportant national industry over an exceptionally difficult period.Admittedly the adoption of the proposals will involve the Government in some risk,     That risk, however, will be reduced by every improvement in foreign markets which occurs before the autumn.     Such improvements will diminish tho stocks which the Government may be asked to take over.     Evenr however, if considerable stocks have to be taken over they will not necessarily represent a loss.     Host of the stocks will keep without deterioration till the end of next winter or even longer.Before
Before then there in a good prospect that improving political and economic conditions tail afford satisfactory- opportunities-for disposal, especially as the Government v/ill aquire the goods at a moderate price.20, The present.conditions of the herring industry are probably without parallel,     The two great foreign markets, Russia and Germany, upon which the industry has depended&apos; for disposal of its surplus stocks, are closed or at any rate precarious,     Only limited supplies of fresh and. smoked fish can be consumed at home,     Our keenest competitors abroad awe their present strength mainly to action taken by this country in connection with the Blockade,21. This Lremo. deals with the general questions ofprinciple involved,     Ho difficulty is anticipated in preparing a scheme acceptable in detail.if and. when the main principles are approved by the War Cabinet.Ve strongly recommend that such approval should, be given. The matter is urgent because -the fishing is due- to-, begin bhisv month.(Ogd.)    ERNLE. (Sgd.)   ROBERT MUMIO,11115 th :.;ay, 1919. j
lJ3L.&apos;0R.^:OTv by the C omit tee appointed at the meeting of representatives of the Herring Pishing Industry on 9th April, 1919.ToThe Fishery Bo^rd for Scotland.A Keeting of the Representatives of the Herring Pishing Industry was held in Aberdeen, on \&apos;wednesday, 9th April, 1919, at 2 p.m.There were present (a) The Scottish Fishermen as represented by Delegates from the Wishing Ports;    (b) The Boat Oners as represented by the Directors of the Scottish Steam Drifters Associationvand others;    (c)   The Fish Curers as represented by Delegates from their Association;   and (e) The Chairman, Secretary and other Delegates from the National Herring Fisheries Protection Association, Great Yarmouth.     There were also present Lieutenant Commander Paymaster Jones, Secretary of the Fishery Board for Scotland, and kr. A.J. Brancler of Messrs. Brander &amp; Cruickshank, Advocates.Sir John H, Irvin, K.B.E,, presided.The object of the meeting was to consider the serious situation in which the industry is likely to be placed at the opening of the summer herring fishing on account of the great Continental markets which, in pre-war times, took practically all the cured fish, being now closed, and to endeavour to find a means of carrying on the industry during the season.Resolutions passed by the various Associations represented were submitted to the Meeting, and a very full discussion followed.After the discussion the following Resolution was submitted to the meeting by the Chairman and was unanimously approved:-&quot;Thatii
&quot;That this nesting of Fishermen, Boat Orners, Curers &quot;and Exporters engaged in the Herring Industry haying considered &quot;together the outlook for the Summer Pishing of 1919, resolve &quot;that a Committee he appointed with full pov/er to approach the &quot;Fishery Board for Scotland and other Departments, and to come&quot;to such an arrangement vith the Government as they may deem to&quot;be in the interests of the Industry&quot;.The Members of Committee appointed vere - Lessre. David Suchan, Peterhe^d, and John Lay, Cairnbulg, Sraserburgh, for the Fishermen;, Sir John H. Irvin and Hr. James Scott, Fraserburgh, for the boat owners;    Messrs. George Slater (or if he is unable to attend any meeting, Kr. Eric Anderson to be his deputy) and Alex. Gordon for the fish curers, Mr. I..A. Thomson for the fish salesmen, and Mr. George Hall for the exporters.    Mr. A.J. Brander rao appointed Cler?; to the Meeting.On 15th April, 1919, the Committee met and haying before them the various resolutions submitted to the meeting of 9th April, the other Statements made at that meeting, and a letter of 12th April from Mr, George Hall to Sir&quot; John K. Irvin, and having fully considered and discussed the various vievs expressed came to the conclusion that the scheme to be submitted by them must be such as is in the interests of the industry as a whole and such as may be reasonably expected the Government r&apos;ill accept.     The following resolution r:as then unanimously agreed to, viz:-&quot;That the Committee having considered with great care &quot;the resolutions submitted to the meeting of 9th April, 1919, &quot;&apos;and the various schemes and suggestions laid before that &quot;meeting resolve that the only practicable scheme which they &quot;can submit to the Government is:-&quot;That the Government grant a guarantee to the Curing Branch &quot;of the Herring Industry previous to the commencement of the &quot;Summer Herring Wishing of 1919, for the prices per barrel asset
i223&quot;set forth belo&quot; for any herrings of good quality remaining &quot;in the Curero1 hands at 15th Sevter-iber, 1919;    that the Government agree to advance to the curer 75JV of the fixed &quot;price at any time prior to 15th September, 1919, for herrings &quot;duly examined by an official of the Government, the curers &quot;still retaining their right to sell these herrings in the &quot;ordinary market subject to the amount advanced being a fixed *charge on the goods, the ultimate handing over of herrings, &quot;being optional but the curers to forfeit any claim on the &quot;Government if intimation is not given on or before 15th &quot;September, 1919;   and that the prices referred to in this resolution be as follows*:-iLtes of Cure,Prior to 1st July. 62/-lst 1   July to 30th Sept.      1      67/-Lar. e Pull3 Pulls Large Mat j es.LatfullS&apos;lie di urn Fulls Medium Ikitjes,57/-62/-Matties52/-57/-SpentsThe above prices are for rhole barrels.. B&apos; s .35/-47/-      35/-The price for half barrels shall be 4/- per two half barrels in excess of the whole barrel price.The Committee anxiously considered rhether a minimum price for the green herring could also be provided for, but they found that this vras&apos; impracticable, and they also had in view that if the Curer was placed in a ponition to buy up to the prices above set forth the catcher would as in former years be reasonably sure of receiving a fair share;   above all the Committee had in view that the important matter for the industry is-to get a start and so avoid the dancer of the Curer standing back seeing that markets are not open to him&apos;.&apos;The*    Corrected figures substituted for those originally inserted.
The provision for an advance of 1b% to 15th September is made to enable the small ourer to carry on his business.The Committee desire to explain that the prices set forth above will not in their opinion work out during the season at more than a good working wage for the catcher and little more than security against loss to the curer.     They oonsider that the fishermen just returned from fighting for their country are at least entitled to this.They would also point out that a scheme such as is suggested by the Committee will prevent unemployment in the industry and so save a us-eless- expejidi.ture by the Government to unemployed.The Committee in close touch with the industry are aware that curers have not made their arrangements for this season&apos;s fishing in advanoe to tho same extent as formerly. There is delay and uncertainty in their engagement of workers and in providing equipment, and they would impress upon the Govern-ment the desirability of the scheme now submi-ttedf&apos; being, oo-nsdd^red .and given effect to with the least possible delay, so that the Curers may be ready when the fishing oown&amp;ncQS.ADD321DI3H prepared by the representatives of the industry after -the deputation to Lord Srnle and llr, Munro on 30th April,In order to protect the fishermen against curers, pur-chasing at unduly low prices and thus reaping an abnormal profit on the basis of the proposed guaranteed price, the follov/ihg issuggested:(a) It is assumed that an examination of all cured herrings by an officer of the Fishery Board for Scotland or other officer duly authorised,, will be a condition of the guarantee.(b) The Fishery Board or the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries should be empowered to call on curers to make a return weekly of the number of crans purchased for curing together with the cost, and also to call for receipts for such purchases if that is considered necessary.(o)
(c) The Fishery Officer having the examination of the- cured herrings will he able to compile a statement of the weekly receipts under the proposed guarantee.(d) Should it be found on making up a statement for the season on the above basis that the sum&apos; left to the curer for cost of cure plus profit exceeds 30/- per barrel completed ready for marketing, the guaranteed price shall be reduced accordingly.(e) It should be remembered that the proposals in clauses a. b, c, and d refer.to a statement on the basic of the proposed guarantee.   Thus, should a curer by his enterprise find a max&apos;.;:et at prices in excess of the proposed guarantee,&apos; such sum realised in excess of the proposed guaranteed pries shall fall to the curer as a reward for his enterprise and the additional risk taken.
