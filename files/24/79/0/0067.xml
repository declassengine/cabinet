The East Suffolk Agricultural Executive m.it tee have &quot;been authorised to. take possession of about 100 acres of d, b?o*5 or less overgrown with bushes.     The grass feed on it isby auction annually from May to October and ineffectual attempts s been made by the Committee to get the land put to a more efiodal use,    The bushes are to be stabbed, the ditches.cleaned , &quot;the hedges cue down and the land &quot;dressed with basic slag.     A-y -useful dairying or stock rearing holding should be formed withinv-sa^e time and in the meantime the Committee will let the zing each year while they hold possession.Proeecut4On, A farmer in East Suicwj. was direoted last October plough&quot;&quot;ap&quot;31 &quot;aore3 of grass land.    He appealed to arbitration andarbitrator decided that the land ought to be broken up.    The raaer took no steps to comply with the order, and declined to paycosts of the arbitration.    The Committee were authorised to take ccodings, and the farmsv in question was convicted and fined  100  21 costs, the Magistrates remarking that theye had been total iancs of the order, and that tlu-ir only doubt was whether they ht not only to impose a fine but send the defendant to prison.Increase ,,oftRent, etc,,,(Amendment) Act, .1918.   With reference to paragraph in last&apos; week^B^report, l.t may be stated that 52 blications hare been made to the Bosrd for certificates under the L and that 20 certificates have been granted.    In the remaining cases the certificate was refused.Determination of Tenancies.   The Office of Woods and Forests lied&apos; to the Beard to take the necessary steps to enable them to let A/burton Farm, Poynings, the tenant of whioh, who was only tailed last Michaelmas, had left the farm -after clearing off iiy the whole of the stock.    After consultation with the West sex Agricultural Executive Committee, the Board issued an enrder determining the tenancy of the farm, and the owners are arranging re-let the farm.(ill)   Provision of Allotments*In accordance with the Board5s instructions, the Wellflperset) Sown Council have negotiated with the owners as to the fs end conditions of the Beard?s continuance- of poesession of t entered en by the Council under the Cultivation of Lands Order, pieces of land revs involved in the negotiations, and in each s the GCunoil hepe to arrange a lease under the Small-Holdings Allotments- Act, IS08,     There was a difficulty in one case as to future rent to be paid, but the Board-s Inspector was able imately to biing both parties to agreement.A communication was received in March last from the WilmBlow eshire) Allotment Association Ltd,, with reference to the termination the tenancy of their allotments hitherto held under private angemcr.it:-     The allotment holders concerned had been unable &quot;ucejves to come to terms with the owners on the question of future It to be paid fos continued occupation.    As a result of intervention jthe Lcard .-&apos; fresh lease of the land l&apos;ias beenfnged for a further five years on terms acceptable to all parties Icerned.

t!5 3t(iv) Land Drainage.Work^.ofJ^epnersjpf,V&amp;r*     In the hope of completing specific schemes before the prisoners 3e?vcT arrangements have been made to concentrate all the prisoners employe6 on dir-an age in East Suffolk on the Rivers Dove and tfaveney.     In Norfolk they aro being concentrated on the V/issey and Thet, and tools provided for the clearance of the Deben in Hast Suffolk (which had not been commenced) have been transferred to Norfolk for their use. It is hoped to effect some concentration at Blunham in order that the &quot;clearance rf the Ivel in Bedfordshire may be completed, but the camp, &quot;which.would hold about 200, cannot be filled owing to the refusal of the Ministry of Labour to permit the transfer of prisoners.    Arrangements have been made to complete work on the Huntingdon section of the Ouse.Yorkshire Ouse.    A conference was held at York on the 6th inst. at the invitation of the Department to consider a scheme for setting up separate drainage authorities to control this river and its tributaries. The Corporation of York kindly lent their Council Chamber and the Lord Mayor presided at the opening of the conference, which included representatives of the three County Councils and Agricultural Executive Committees and of the drainage and navigation authorities concerned. The scheme (which had been drawn up so as to preserve as far as possible the separate interests of the three Ridings) did not find favour, and a resolution was passed, without any dissentient vote, in favour of creating a single Board with jurisdiction over the whole river system. It was also resolved that the County Councils should appoint a small joint committee to confer with the Board for this purpose.(v) Tithe, Commons, Co-pyhold and Survey.A compulsory redemption of tithe rentcharge charged on lands at Eastbourne has given rise to a great deal of correspondence with the property owners concerned.     The area affected by this redemption is 120 acrss, mostly covered by buildings, and the number of property owners concerned is approximately 1,000.     60 objections, including 37 contained in a memorial sent to the Board, have been reoeived, the general complaint being that the lessor and not the lessee should pay the redemption assessment.    The Duke of Devonshire, who developed the Estate, is the lessor.    His Graoe does not, however, accept responsibility for the shares of redemption money and costs assessed u-:cn these properties, and under the Tithe Acts, the Board have no cption bat to recover the assessments from the holders of tho beneficial leases in question.I Section 28 of the Commons Act, 1376, provides that where the trustees of a Recreation Ground are the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Parish they dialL at intervals of not more than five and not less than throe yoa.?s make such reports to the Board in respect of tho Recreat]on Grounds under their management, with such particulars 1 of the rents reoeived by them, as the Board may require.     With a view I to the release of the maximum possible number of the members of the staff of the Branch for service in HI s Majesty s Forces, this and certain other work was suspended during the war.     The good management of Recreation Grounds has,however, an important bearing on the amenities of country life and therefore indirectly upon land settlement.     In the circumstances the Board have now decided that this work shall bo resumed.
S ommero 1 al i Divipion,Suts*     Tiie-Treasury has now agreed, that the X^iJ^s^X-board may supply huts on credit to small holders^ and orthens apprwsd&apos;by*&quot;&apos;&quot; this Departmentn     In order iso secure the noo-ee-siary financial guarantee it is proposed only to give credit to Co-operative Societies who can undertake the actual sale to the small holder.fioJ&amp;JL^SJSl&amp;SS,&apos;     The Plans prepared Toy the Office of Works for the proposed&quot; small holdings at Bolleston; Notts, have been approved subject to certain suggested alterations.    Plans for small holders cottages have been submitted by the Cheshire and TJJast Hiding County Council and are under consideration^FertiliserSo     The Sulphate of Ammonia makers have now agreed to the arrangement whereby they reserve a supply of 35,000 tons of Sulphate of Ammonia for sale to Compound Fertiliser llakers during the next four months and provide 5*090 tons for immediate use by farmers at  17 per ton0     The price to be fixed for the season after September next will depend on the competitive price at which Nitrate of Soda is available.Complete figures are now available in respect of the cost incurred by the Department in the do?, j very of Sulphate of Ammonia under the arrangement made early in 1917 whereby the maker received   &apos;.&apos;-10/* per ton fiom the purchaser to cover delivoiy charges, tne excess cost boing paid by the Government,     During the 15 months from the 3.2th February 1917 to net Kay, 1913.. 230,000 tons of Sulphate of Ammonia wtCfe delivered &apos;j,y. rail or water, ct an average cost of 14/7d, per ton, the sum payable by the Government fceiJSL; just over  53,000,,     During the subsequent 12 month.j *he charge will be less as the contribution by the purchaser has been increased from 10/- to 12/6 d.. per ton, while in addition the cost of delivery both of superphosphate and basic slag has aveiaged appreciably less than 12/6d., so that there will be some credit balance to be set against the loss on Sulphate of Ammonia.House.......Kefuse.     Two London Boroughs, viz, Southwark andBermondsey are&quot;selling crushed house refuse as a fertiliser with satisfactory results.     The quantity available is 4C,OOC tons per annum, and its value as- a fertiliser is equal to stable manure. The attention of local Committees and Allotment Associations is being drawn to it.Marketing and Transport of Fruit,     The Hallway Executive Committee recently drew attention to the need for some action to prevent congestion at the London Markets in view of the probability of a good fruit crop,    The matter was considered at a Conference of various interests and as a result it is proposed to issue a Notice to growers and salesmen giving recommendations prepared by Railway Companies with a view to avoiding waste of road and rail transport,     Tliis Notice will also be       exhibited as a poster at Country Stations,     The diversion of fruit from London to other markets, which is the obvious way of relieving the congestion in the fruit season is difficult, owing to the fact that the grower consigns his produce in baskets provided, as a rule, by the London salesman, who objects to the produce coing sent elsewhere.Seed Potatoes,   Up to the 1st April, 1919, the Board1s Inspectors examined 0,000 tons o,f seed potatoes, for which export licences had been issued..\7art Disease,    The introduction of the VTart Disease of potatoes (Scottish Seed Potatoes) Order of 1919 appears likely to increase the acreage planted with immune varieties in Scotland and therefore it is probable that supplies of immune &quot;seed&quot; of second-early and main-crop varieties for planting in 1920 will be Efficient to meet the demands of the areas which, have recently keen certified under the Jart Disease of Potatoes Order of 1918,

Arrangements have &quot;been made by the Board and the Royal Commission on Y/heat Supplies for the inspection Pf cargoes of Plat vfhite South african maize in order that suitable parcels may be selected for seed.    The quantity available at present is limited and the demand for maize is in excess of the supply.    It is hoped, however, that it may be possible te secure further quantities. *&apos;The Increased Production of Greases and olpvergi seed., tfith a view to increasing the production of certain grasses and clovers for seed, a survey is being made of the chief districts in England and Wales in which clover is grown and saved for seed.     The distriot, to be visited include Essex, Kent, Hampshire, Gloucester, Somerset, Montgomery, Hereford, Cornwall, the Vale of Clwyd, Norfolk, Suffolk and Sussex.The Testing of Seeds Order.,   Official tests on a control sample of Ryegrass   seed taken recently on the premises of a retail seedsman, gave an average germination of 38 per oeni. as against the retailer&apos;s declaration of 92 per cent.    The retailer thereupon returned the seed to the wholesale merchant from whom he had purchased it as growing 92 per cent.     The wholesaler then protested that the figure he declared was the result ef a test carried out last August and that tests made since the seed had been returned from the retailer- gave an average germination of 72 per cent,,Control samples taken by an Official Sampler from each of the bags remaining unsold, showed however, that the seed urns of very uneven quality, the germination of the various &quot;bags ranging from 74 per cent, down to 14 per cent.The action taken under the Order therefore prevented the possibility of a farmer buying a bag of ryegrass seed declared to germinate 92 per cent, which in fact would only grow 14 per1 cent.Horticultural Division,County Organisation.The business of forming new Horticultural Sub-Committees of the County Council is ;        /cooing forward in a good many counties.Secretaries of Allotment Associations in Leicester, Huntingdon, Isle of Sly and Lincolnshire have been interviewed re Horticultural Education,     The general opinion is that more active practical work should be carried out by the Horticultural Committees,In Wiltshire the ^Var Horticultural Sub-Committee which has acted as the County Horticultural Committee is to be retained in its entirety.     The policy here does not appear to be a very progressive one   and an exhaustive enquiry should be made before any scheme is sanctioned.In Glamorganshire it is not proposed to form a Committee to deal directly with Horticulture and it is not considered practical ^o establish a training Institute the county being chiefly industrial

A third meeting is to be held on June 11th, when a draft of the policy to be pursued will be submitted,,Cambri,dgjeshi. re.     In the Willingham and Cottenham district * plums are blooming well except Monarch which is shy, and Ponds -   Seedling which is patchy,     Apples are full of bloom,     Winter Moth and Lackey Iloth are to be found fairly prevalent and Ilildew has appeared on Lane&apos;s Prince Alberto     Strawberries, Gooseberries, Red and Black Currants look well, but Raspberries are showing badly.    Around Meldrith and Ilelburn all Plums are full of bloom, also apples except Lord Derby$    Gooseberries and Red Currants good, Black Currants poor.Evesham.   An experimental station where research and other important work can be carried out is being urged for this   area.&quot;Silver Leaf&quot; is a great trouble here and growers are realising that the only way to be rid of it is to grub up affected trees and burn.    Legislation making &quot;Silver Leaf&quot; a notifiable disease would be welcomed.It is desired that the Government should give some protection against the dumping of foreign Uruit and vegetables.   Growers will not trouble to improve transport while there is a fear of low prices being forced by foreign competition.Allotments in Bradford.     There are a large number of allotments here,    very available patch of ground seems to be under cultivation, even the most inaccessible slopes where smoke, smuts, and poisonous fumes are doing their worst,Yorkshire County Allotments, Federation Ltd,    A meeting of this Federation was attended and it was decided to as&quot;k *i,P,!s, Councillors, and Aldermen for their support to a memorial stating that allottees wish to cultivate their allotments permanently,A promise was made to give a demonstration on the cultivation of fruit, &quot;both tree and bush, if a meeting could be arranged.Fruit Preservation.     A course of Instruction covering the various methods of Fruit and Vegetables Preservation has been given at Llaidstone this week to candidates chosen by the Horticultural Sub-Committees for East and West Kent.Small Live Stock Section,Public interest in rabbit keeping is&apos; still very keen. Numerous enquiries have been received for Local Stud Centres, Clubs, and addresses of persons desiring to purchase pure bred utility rabbits, besides advice in curing ailments.Poultry.      A number of correspondents have asked what assistance the Government will give in connection with training on Poultry Farms, and to each of these a list of farmers willing to instruct ex-Service men has been sent, together with ter:.i3 and conditions.     The average terms are 30/- per week for training, board and lodging, or 10/-without.
.S1BJS.S    There are signs of revival in connection with Pig Keeping Correspondents have asked for full particulars, etc., regarding feeding and breeding-     A report reached the Department to the effect that the Sanitary Authorities were imposing certain restrictions on pig keeping which made it impossible for small holders to continue . keeping pigs.     The matter was immediately taken up by the Department, and a visit was paid to Rusper in Sussex, the scene of the trouble.&apos; It was found that in the case which caused the trouble the pig keeper who had only a small garden (30&apos; by 10&apos;;) had not boarded it off from his neighboursK- gardens and had not attempted to keep the pigs clean, The place was In a filthy condition and the smell obnoxious.     The * ; ,Sanitary Authorities had not imposed any general restrictions but were ready to take up such a case as this in the interests of the public.technical Section.Technical and Cultivation DivisionCo,-operative Research.     The necessity for control and guidance of home /-agriculture during the war has revealed what are the outstanding fundamental problems upon which reliable information is required in&quot;.:a time of crisis.     On very few, if any, of these problems has existing information proved adequate.     A Sub-Committee of the Technical Commit tee was appointed&apos;to consider the question., and has drawn up a schedule of the main problems on which co-operative research is required.     These problems, from their nature, cannot bo dealt with effectively by an individual investigator, and it is suggested that the list might be brought to the notice of agricultural educational institutions possessed of the requisite facilities, owith a view to arranging co-operative work on a common plan on one or other of the problems scheduled.     The organisation of such co-operative work will necessitate the establishment of a central advisory body which would be charged with the drafting of the basal lines upon which each series of investigations would be carried out, and of this body the Sub-   i Committee suggest that the Technical Committee might form an effeotive nucleus.The Sub-Ccmmittee1s report has been adopted by the Committee, and will be submitted for the Board&apos;s consideration.Iractor Section *During the week ended 25th April, 3,303 tractors were in the I hands of Committees and 1.092 of these were being operated under the new contract scheme-Of the 2,213. operated by Committees directly, 1172 were being /got ready for sale leaving 2.039 available;   of these fly202 (or 69$) were in &quot;Commission and were idle for only 10$ of the time on account of bad weather.     3o2 tractoxs were idle for lack of Work., 384 were under repair and 71 were not being operated for lack of labour.In England and Y/ales S,65&amp; acres were ploughed and 17,755 cultivated by ls640 tractors, giving an average of 5.28 aores and 10,;S3 aores respectively.     Of this acreage 40 per cent of the ploughing and 5 4 per cent of the cultivating was done in the fifteon counties which are working under the new contract scheme.     The total acreage dealt with shows an increase over the previous week of 66 per cent in the case of ploughing and just over 100 per sent   in the case of cultivating.The highest average was recorded in Shropshire where 39tractors ploughed 410 acres and cultivated 565: average 10.5 acres and 14.5 acres respectively.e.
w d 8- iiDuring the v/eek the proposals of the Anglesey, Carnarvon and Merioneth Committees were approved.    Definite proposals have not yet &quot;been submitted by five Committees.     The number of tractors to be retained afoer the end of Kay is now approximately 1,300 out of a total of 3..750.Px ice of Fuel,    Resolutions have been reoeived from the majority of Agricultural Executive Committees dravdng attention to the effect upon agriculture of present prices of petrol and paraffin, and urging that the control on these coinmodities should be removed.    Government control (uncor winch maximum wholesale and retail prices are fixed) has now cet r-oa and the Petroleum Companies will in the near future be marketing supples imported by themselves in the ordinary course of trade.    The Fot.roileurn Executive state, however, that prices in this country are dependent upon those ruling in the United States where the prices fixed by the United States Government during the war have been maintained and, tm the case of pn-affin prices, even increased owing to demand outrunning -. supply and that it is difficult at the present stage to say whether &apos; there rail be any reduction in price beyond that which has already taken place since the Armistice.     Committor a have been informed accordingly land have been notified that the Department will continue to watch the (position and take action when a favourable opportunity occurs.Luiremente and Disposal Section.1   During the week ended the 10th Hay, returns of sales have been -received from Durham, Westmorland, Oxford, Cumberland, Pembroke, ! Leicester, Cheshire, East Suffolk, Glamorgan, Denbigh, Bedford, IHorthumberland, East Sussex and Essex.The returns show that the following have &quot;been disposed of:-I950 tractors 1,23 9 tractor ploughs7C6 miscellaneous tractor implements830 binders 50       &apos;.  omowers and reapers 2,6 j 4 horse ploughs6C1 drills&apos;8^3 carts and lDrries 2;icy harrows and cultivators 1,115 rollers and preseer3 78 potato differs 21 spraying machines 2,741 wh:* ppletree s6 threshing machines&apos;276,352 ,0 .8. has been realised in respect of the sale of the machinery tnd implements above enumerated.I Up to date 301 sales have been held, for which 273 returns arepail able.     Sixty further sales are definitely fixed and others Provisionally arranged.I Good prices continue to be obtained:   Fordson and Titantractors hc^e revised as much as  220 and  236 respectively, while a llayton tiactcr at Sa^mundham realised  305.     Binders, carts and lorries still obtain excellent prices. ,A corirparison of the results of sales held by the Disposal Beard Ind the Disposal Section of this Department is interesting.     The former Ppartment were handed 931 tractors for sale and have sold 635 of the Isst with a loss on cost of  72.8. per cent.    The tractors sold by this
Department are those no longer required by the Agricultural Executivetommlttoes and therefore of the least value, and have realised prices iiowing a depreciation of only  41*8 per cent.Assistance has been given to other Divisions in the disposal and supply of equipment.srse Section.The total number of&apos;horses sold to date is 4,030, 110 of which were sold during the past week.    The average price remains about the sameSome of the best prices realised in the recent sales were8 at Market Bosworth at an average of  1138 at Uonnouth at an average of  105 32 at York at an average of  112 15 at Leicester at an average of  123.Since the last report arrangements have boon made to dispose of a further 480 horses during the month of May.    Replies to a circular sent out on the subject have not yot been received from all the Counties, but the number to be sold under present arrangements is 1,073.earn Tackle Section.Returns have been received from 185 steam tackle owners during the week ended 4th May.     Thcso returns show that 1,782 implement acres wore ploughed, 9,764 cultivated, and 5,864 harrowed, giving an average of 9*6 acres, 52,8 acres and 31,7 acres per set respectively.     Slaty-one acres were molo drained, making together with the above a total of 17,471 implement acres, an average of 94,4 acres por set.The Counties of Kent, Dorset, Oxford, Wiltshire, Hampshire and Berkshire show the largest acreage worked.Complaints as to the shortage of, coal havo been gradually diminishing and the Department have been able to assist practically every person from whom .:- complaints have been received&apos;, especially drainage authorities.In many cases where farmers have complained that they are unable to obtain coal for agricultural purposes the difficulty has been due to the disregard or want of knowledge of the regulations for obtaining it.     The quality of tho coal available is still very poor. This is a serious matter for steam ploughs and there seems little prospect ef an immediate improvement taking place in this respect.Labour Division,Training of Sx-Seryice mon.

Soldier Labour.     The War Office have now agreed to increase the number of soldiers in or attached to the Agricultural Companies who are to be retained on the land from ten per cent to twenty per cent.    The County Agricultural Executive Committees have been informed and they are now engaged in selecting the men who are to be retained.The number of soldiers remaining in or attached to the Agricultural Companies at the end of the week was 22,963.Women&apos;s Branch.The demand for skilled workers continues considerably to exceed the available supply.A scheme for providing scholarships in thatching, like that in Hertfordshire has been sanctioned-for Pembroke.     The principal features are that students will be taught for 14 vdays each on the farm in batches of four; and the scholarships will be of the value of 25/-per week, to include the cost of training and board and lodging.Women are being trained for milking and stock work at the Ryms Training Centres, Sherborne,     The head cowman who is responsible for the training is specially successful in teaching milking.    Over 90 girls have been trained at the Centre, and reports show that all of them are doing extremely well.Various training centres have had to be closed down, either because the house room is now required, or because, as in the case of Captain de Cleremonfs Centre at Mngfield, the owner is disposing of a large number of his cows and cutting down expenses in many directions owing to the price of milk.The Agricultural Department of the Aberystwyth University has organised an agricultural course for farmers&apos; daughters to begin on the 12th May.    Scholarships for this course have been awarded by the following counties:-Cardiganshire......   26Carmarthenshire ... 12 Pembrokeshire ..... 10 Breconshire and Radnor 30 Montgomeryshire ....     5In the case of Cardiganshire, a  10 scholarship has been awarded to every girl who applied.Women&apos;s Institutes.    28 new Women&apos;s Institutes were formed last week, making a total of 1,056.

It is satisfactory&quot; in a way to have such a large number of reports as it shows that the public and officials are aiiive as to their obligations, although it causes a lot of work that is really unnecessary.    An Order has been issued (13th Hay) to operate on the 16th declaring an enlarged inner area of the london district to y/hich special conditions will apply.     This area includes the two&apos; small areas around Acton and Byfleot that were scheduled on the 5th.     The work of the Branch both indoor and. outdoor is naturally particularly heavy.During the statistical week ending the 10th, 2 outbreaks of Sheep-scab and 87 of Parasitic Mange were reported.Rats Order.For the guidance of persons appointed to supervise Rat Destruction, Notes have been prepared by the Technical Adviser and copies will be ready for issue this week to Local Authorities and their Officials.     These Notes based on 25 years&apos; experience of organised rat destruction should act as a stimulant and have a useful educational effect.The Technical Adviser, in addition to attandances at Meetings of Local Authorities, has given advice in many cases where advice has been asked.     On the 7th inst. he visited the Horton (County of London) War Hospital, &quot;pson, and reported &quot;In addition to the rat infested laundry, the farm buildings, cemented piggeries, and over 1,100 acres of-land harboured huge -mumpers of rats.     3 ricks recently threshed yielded about 200 rats.     3 further stacks are infested and are to be threshed immediately.     A large manure heap was recently removed from , the centre of the concreted yard around which the pigsties are built. I With the aid of dogs a cartload of rats were killed.    Dansyz&apos;s Virus I has been applied, the last time at an expenditure of  60.    During the \ war hage stores of food have been held at Hoi ton to feed the 2,700 I wounded soldiers there.     The Bailiff computes the loss, through the ; inroad of rats, at a minimum of  1,000 yearly.    A great factor in the &apos; increase of rats at Horton is the ploughing up of a large acreage of i pasture for foodstuffs.&quot;Further cases of damage caused by rats and mice continue to I come before the Rats Branch.    Evidence of the deplorable condition of j the corn stacks in many parts of the country, and reports from time to I time in the Press of the number of rats destroyed during threshing cannot but prejudice the claim put forward by farmers that unless they are guaranteed higher prices for grain they cannot carry on with arable farming.     Farmers in the past 3 or 4 years have undoubtedly experienced exceptional difficulties in taking adequate measures to destroy vermin I and protect their stacks against attack, bet it is notorious that as a I class they have neglected, for years, to make any serious effort to save their growing or harvested crops from the depredations of rats I and mice.The consumer realises that &quot;He that will have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding&quot;, but he won&apos;t tarry with j patience if he finds that vermin in the meantime&quot; get half the cake and I the farmer seeks to redress the loss by asking for higher guaranteed prices for his grain.

The Board, however, concurred in the deposit of some consignment of cordite in a specified area in the North Sea.SSSr.li-ltlnffand ^Demabp.!sat,lon .o,f^Kej^ermen*      During the period from September 1916 to Octoh^r &apos;l9t3 &quot;over&quot; &quot;4,0DC fishermen were called up; vdth the Board&apos;s approval, for service in the RVN,R. (Trawler Section). It is estimated that in all approximately 36,000 fishermen in England and 7ales joined the colours during the war, or about 75$ of the fishing man-power.The number of demobilisations of fishermen from Naval Service so far reported to the Board is 1,400, but this figure is known to be inadequate.     Indeed it is understood that the actual number demobilised at Lowestoft alone is about 3,000.The number of denobi3.ipations from Military service is.also too incompletely known to be worth quoting, but it nay be of interest.it to a state that the total numJjoro of applications approved and recommended by a the Board for demobilisation were as follows.-Military 3,200Naval 1,300 2,100Every effort hap been made to secure the release of men whose I services were genuinely important to the fishing industry, and it is (&quot; felt that on the whole these efforts have been very successful.iOver 1,000 steam fishing vessels have now been reported by the toralty as demobilised or about to be demobilised at ports in Sngland md 7ales.    Reconditioning is proceeding slowly, but there is tactically no unemployment. 13.
Installations.    On Friday, Hay 2nd, trials were ..&apos;run at Flam-borough of the first beach &quot;coble&quot; in which the Committee have installed a motor.    In itself the conversion of the &quot;coble&quot; to power does not present any great difficulties, but in the case of Flamborough the difficulties lie entirely in the beach up and down which the vessel has to be landed and launched.     The North landing consists of a long shelving beach leading to a mud slope which is set at an angle of about 45 degrees to the beach.     The hauling of the boat up the beach, and mud slope is not difficult provided sufficient power is available; It is the launching, therefore, which presents the greatest difficulties for a boat with weight in her is apt to dig into the sand beach on leaving the mud slope.To overcome the difficulty of launching and beaching the vessel has been made of a slightly modified type with the fore foot cut up considerably more than is usual for a coble.    The propeller, which has been made four-bladed to reduce diamater, is snugly stowed in a tunnel and it would be practically impossible for it to be damaged except in the improbable eventuality of damage being caused by a peculiar shaped rock during the procees of beaching.     So far the boat has proved very successful and the owners have quickly learned to manipulate the engine at the slow speed required for line hauling.Intelligence Division.Education Branch. , -Progress has been made with the award of exhibitions; and some holders of scholarships whose tenure was interrupted by the war have now resumed work. In all, 9 exhibitions have now been awarded and 4 scholarships have been resumed.Proposals are now being received from the Colleges and Institutions providing higher education in agriculture with a view to tho reconstruction of their work in order to secure increased efficiency and one Research Institute has replied to the Board&apos;s invitation to submit a scheme of staffing and salaries on lines indicated by the Board.    The question of block grants in respect of demonstration and experimental farms maintained by institutions providing higher education in agriculture is now under consideration.Applications are now being received from research workers attached to various institutions for grants in aid of research work carried out by them bearing upon agricultural problems:   these applications vail be referred to the Advisory Committee appointed by the Development Commissioners.    A special soil survey Sub-committee of the Advisory Committee has been formed for the purpose of reporting to the parent Committee on the question of soil surveys and grants in connection therewith.The Local Government Board have been recommended to authorise, and have authorised, the raising by the Staffordshire County Council of a loan of  24,000 for the purpose of the provision of a farm institute for the county.Letters have been addressed to the Local Education Authorities responsible under the Board1s scheme for the Distribution of Sittings cf 71ggs for the supervision of the individual station holders, asking them to collect record books and information as to trap nesting and to examine and report on these records.    &apos;7hon this information is received from the Local Education Authorities it will be possible to survey the results of the scheme during the season now closing.

There are at present 35 Travelling Cheese Schools conducting coursas of instruction.     These are provided by 24 counties.Co-operative Cheese Schools.   Up to the present 13 Co-operative Cheese Schools are at work.     As explained in previous reports the scheme as a whole is being adversely affected by the continuance of control of milk and by no announcement having been made respecting the control price of cheese.The co-operative cheese factories in Cornwall, which have been established as a r-osolt of the work of co-operative cheese Schools, are at present considerably alarmed through having received from the Ministry of Pood a form of licence requiring them to sign a statement to the effect that they will pay to tho Ministry 2d, for each gallon of milk received oy them.     If this requirement is persisted in by the Ministry it is probable that it will go a long way towards dis-organising these young and hitherto promising societies.Arable Daary^Farming.

An explanatory Press Notice has been issued by the Ministry of Labour on behalf of all Departments concerned in the :eneral Scheme of Higher Education and Training of ex-Officers and men 1 if similar educational qualifications.An account of the satisfactory progress of the Board&apos;s training Scheme has been circulated in the &quot;Weekly Service&quot;.Travelling Expenses of County Committees.    The Treasury have tefused to authorise the refund of these expenses in full, mainly on fee ground that local ,vv      &quot;Education Committees can already have)-thirds of these expenses refunded by the Board as expenditure of [local administration on agricultural education generally.Army Huts for accommodating Officer Farm Trainees.    The for thumb or land Education Committee propose to provide Army huts for pommodating officer pupils on certain particularly suitable farms pere other accommodation is not available.    One farmer has offeredtrain 6 or 8 pupils if hut accommodation is provided, and is piling to purchase the huts for his own use subsequently.Application of National Health Insurance and Workmen^s sation Acts to Officer Farm Trainees.    Several County Councils we raised these points.    As regards:the National Health Insurance fts the Board have replied after consultation v/ith the Insurance pnissioners, to the effect that provided - as is intended by the fed - no wages are paid by the farmer to the &quot;officer pupil&quot;, the pith Insurance Acts do not apply.The question of the applicability of the Workmen1s feansation Act has not yet been decided.    It is most important that piers taking officer pupils should not be liable to pay compensation the event of an officer pupil meeting with an accident during
 ruining - otherwise there will &quot;be great difficulty in inducing farmers to take these pupils under the Scheme .     In the Board&apos;s opinion the Act does not apply but the Home Office have some doubts on the subject and, -as the matter is one which concerns equally other Government Departments dealing with the training of ex-officers in industry, it is being discussed at the next Inter-Departmental Conference, and, if necessary, a ruling will be obtained from the Treasury Solicitor.Flax Production Branch.Favourable weather during the last fortnight has enabled growers to complete the sowing of the new crop under excellent conditions.The output of seed during the week ending 8th May was 1,853 cwts., making a total output to that date of 3,517 tons dressed seedDeseeding operations are now practically completed except at Peterborough.The total acreage of flax for which contracts have been signed for 1919 crop amounts to 12,666 acres, distributed as follows:-Acres.Somerset and Dorset ... 3,681 Lincoln and Horthants..   4,408Yorkshire.............   1,724Suffolk and ^ssex .....   1,863Fife    .................   1.01012,686Kelham Estate.A large proportion of the manual labour, approximately 30$, has been engaged throughout the year upon maintenance and development work.

Ho unusual changes were disclosed.The monthly report on the dond.ition of crops, on 1st May, showed that the season was still very backward;   ouch spring corn yet remained to be sown, and very little planting of the main crop of potatoes had yet been done.    Reports indicated that about a normal number of lambB had been born this spring, but that the cold and wet had resulted in a Mortality slightly greater than usual.Sea fish landed in April amounted to 613,000 cwts. -the largest quantity, except during the herring season, in any month since the war broke out - and 60 per cent, more than in March.    The total value as landed ; over 1-J- million pounds sterling, v/as the largest on record except October 1913.    The average value works out to  Z, 10. $er cwt. or fully 15/- per ctrt. loss than in March, and exactly half the average value of a year ago.18b.
Agricultural Wages Board.Meetings of the &quot;Adminiatration&quot; Committee, Ccwmitteea on &quot;Customary Hours&quot;, Harvests and &quot;Probationary Periods^ were h^d^ on the 6th, and a meeting of the &quot;Selection&quot; Committee on the 8th * immediately before the meeting of the Wages Board.The Conference with representatives cf all the District Wages Committees to discuss questions relating to the work of the Board and of the District Committees was held in the Central Hall, Westminster, on Wednesday the 7th Hay, 1919, at 10,30 a,m.Two Appointed Members, two Representatives of Employers, two Representatives of Workers and the Secretary were invited from each District Wages Committee, and about 250 representatives of the District Committees attended in all, together with all the members of the Wages Board except 4,    Representatives of the Press had been invited provisionally, and the Conference decided at the outset that they should be allowed to remain.After an opening statement by the Chairman the members of the District Committees were invited to express their views and about 36 took part in the discussion which covered a wide range of subjects.It was the general sense of the Conference that no definite resolutions should be put in regard to relations of the District Committees and the Wages Board.&apos;   After a considerable number of members of the District Committees had spoken various members of the Wages Board took part, explaining points which h^cL^-been raised and replying to criticisms which had been made.The Agricultural Wages Board met on the 8th and 9th May,The Board appointed a small Committee to consider and report upon the suggestions and criticisms made-at the Conference by members of the various District Committees,Protests were received from a large, -number of District Wages Committees against the action taken by the Wages Board in issuing their Proposal of the 1st April to vary the^inlmim^ratea for male workers of 18 and over throughout England and Wales before consulting the District Wages Committees,     This matter was-brought forward at the Conference and will be one of the matters to be considered by the Committee referred to above.The Board then considered, county by county, the objections which had been lodged to their Proposal of the 1st April to vary the minimum, rates for male workers of 18 and over, and the reports from each of the District Wages Committees on the Proposal.     They decided to confirm their Proposal except in regard to ordinary labourers in Cumberland and Westmorland (with regard to whom the District Wages Committee had recommended that no alteration should be made) and in regard to the special class workers in Herts, Kent, Middlesex, Northants, Salop, Surrey, Sussex and Wilts,     (in regard to which Proposals had already been issued to cancel the Special Classes Orders)     The revised rates will come into operation on the 19th Hay and if as is proposed the Special Classes Orders in the eight counties just mentioned are cancelled before that date all male workers of 18 and over will then be subject to the new minimum and overtime rates for ordinary labourers with the following variations of general conditions., etc ; -
(a) A reduction in the hours for which the minimum wage for ordinary labourers is payable, to 54 in &quot;Summer&quot; and 48 in &quot;Winter&quot;, in the counties where such hours have beenin excess of these hours. V(b) An addition to the weekly wages at present payable to ordinary labourers, of the following sums (subject to slight adjustment&apos;to round sums):Workers of 18 and under 19 years of age       3/- a week. ii       ii ii       ii     go     ii     ii     ii 4 A. &quot;     &quot;ii       n   20   &quot;       &quot;     21     n     &quot;     &quot; 5/- &quot;     &quot;&quot;      &quot;   21 years and over 6/6 &quot;     &quot;Wi^h corresponding adjustments of the overtime rates on tae basic of ti-ne a&apos;id a quarter on weekdays and time and a half on Sunday (except as regards Cumberland, Westmorland, and the lurness District of Lancashire).In the case of those counties where the number of hours per week are in excess of 54 in Summer and 48 in Winter, the above additions will be made, not to the present weekly wages, but to the ^cesent weekly wa;;es reduced to a basis of 52 hours all the year round. &apos;&apos;-!%$W-r0$(c)      An increase in the special rates fixed for special classes of workers such, as Horsemen, Stockmen, Shepherds, etc., by amounts corresponding to the increase in the rates for: ordinary labourers (except ,as regards the eight counties referred to above).On a report from the &quot;Harvests&quot; Committee presented by Mr. Yates, the Board decided to inform the various District Wages Committees that they do not propose to fix any special rates for Hay Harvest for this year, and that if it is the unanimous desire of any District Wages Committee that no special rates should be fixed for Corn Harvest and that the matter should be left for settlement between the Employers and Workers Organisations in the district, the Board would be prepared to act on such recommendation.After consideration of the question of a revision of the minimum rates at present in operation for women of 18 and over, the Board proposed that that rate shall be raised to 7d. an hour in the case of the areas in which it is at present 6d., and to 6d. an hour in the areas in which it is at present 5d. with corresponding increases in the overtime rates and in the weekly and overtime rates fixed for whole time workers in Northumberland. Before any formal Hot in/e cf Proposal is issued, the draft Proposal will be submitted to the District Wages Comittees.The question of varying the minimum rates for girls and for boys was postponed,A special meeting of the Wages Board will be held on the 15th Hay for the purpose of dealing with the Proposals tc cancel the Special Glasses Orders in Herts, Ilent, Hidales ex; Northants, Salop, Surrey, Sussex, and Wilts, and the next regular meeting on the 29th Hay.During the week, 150 cases of complaint of non-payment of the minimum rates were received, the largest number from a single county bein;; 25 in the case of Yorkshire,     29 cases were sent to Inspectors for visit, enquiries by correspondence were made in 221 cases;   and 31 cases were completed,     Reports were received from Inspectors in 43 cases,
