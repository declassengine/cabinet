m rhfg Document Is the Proper&quot;      . , v.--a^,JCLTcc,&apos;   &apos;: :^n?0 Mafeys Govern I circulated by the Secretary of State for India,SECRET.INDIAN REFORMS.- ; The position at the moment is this. The Government of India Despatch on the Reform scheme, and the opinions of Local Governments have arrived in this country, together with the reports of Lord Soutliborough&apos;s Committees. These are in the next week or so to be published. A Bill has long been drafted, and it was some time ago referred to a Cabinet Committee. Since then, as the material has developed, it has been revised and considered over and over again by an important Reforms Committee sitting in the India Office. Roughly it carries out such parts of the Montagu-chelmsford Report as require legislative achievement, and it has now reached a stage at which little or no further progress can be made at the India Office.But the subject is so technical, the papers are so voluminous, that it is impossible to ask the Cabinet to inform itself about the measure. As regards the Committee of the Cabinet to which it was entrusted, the other heavy preoccupations of its Members have so far permitted only of such separate study of the papers as each individual member has been able to make, and after consultation with my colleagues of the Committee, i has reluctantly concluded that there is no hope in the immediate future of any change in this situation. I am gratified to find, however, that the result of such interchange of views with my colleagues of the Committee as has been possible has been to confirm my own general view that the voluminous criticism to which the scheme&apos;of the Montagii-chelmsford Report has been subjected, still leaves it in principle in command of the field.Meanwhile, I am receiving almost daily from India representations from both official and non-official sources that the early introduction of a Bill is imperatively required by the situation there, and large numbers of Indians are arriving in the country for the express purpose of furthering its introduction and of giving evidence before the Joint Committee to which the Government has promised, to refer it. I am convinced, that much further delay will have the most unfortunate consequences, and that public confidence that the Government intend to fulfil the promises which I was authorised to make nearly two years ago will be severely shaken unless legislation is achieved this year. If we are to do this and carry the Bill through all Its stages, including the long deliberations of the Joint Committee, it must be introduced forthwith. The proposal, therefore, which I have now to make to my colleagues is that I should have their general authority to introduce a Bill next month, and to move in due course that it be referred to a Select Committee of both Houses.I do not ask my colleagues for more than a second reading support of the Bill. I shall of course in introducing it explain to the House my own views on various suggestions that have not been adopted in the draft, but I shall leave those matters to be discussed by the Committee, and I shall ask the Cabinet to decide on those matters on which I find myself at variance with the Select Committee when it has reported. But so convinced am I that no further delay is possible that I am compelled to ask to be allowed to introduce the Bill. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and the President of the Board of Education, who have received all the documents, concur with me in regarding immediate progress as essential and in recommending this course to secure it. To their general support of the scheme which the Bill will embody I have already alluded.E. S. M.9th May 1919.10  SS 93  50  o/19
