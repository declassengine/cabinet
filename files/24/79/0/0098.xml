This Document is tae .J 1 ja   &apos;WMbiiiiibiMWhw.....*..........i&apos;     &apos; 1   in - N.N.I.-nrrmr--n*- &quot;    *WIW ----His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Governmthe First and Second&apos; Reports of the Land Acquisition Committee.1. The Bill is designedly limited in scope.     It doesnot touch(a) the granting cf powers to take land compulsorily -(the subiect of the first of the above reports Cd. 8998](b) Private promoters.(o) (i) Injurious Affection and Betterment;(ii) Recoupment;(iii) Power to take part of a property;(iv) Power to withdraw notice to treat;(v) Various minor proposals contained in the second of the above reports (Cd. 9229), which taken together are of great importance for the successful working out of a simple, cheap, and expeditious system for the compulsory acquisi-tion of land.2. By reason of the strictly limited title of the Bill,I understand that the above subjects cannot be introduced into the Bill by amendment - except oertain of those covered by (o). There is no Standing Order cf the House under which the title of a Bill oan be enlarged, unless it is amalgamated with another Bill.If therefore, the above matters are to be dealt with, a new Bill must be introduced. 3. For the following reasons I submit this ought to bedone at once.-(a) There is, I believe, general agreement, with the recommendation of the above reports that the Lands Clauses Acts should be repealed and replaced by a new oode - The Bill de-^s not do it.ACQUISITION OF LAND (ASSESSMENT OF COS0OTSATION) BILL,1919,on thefiORANDUk BY riLs, PRaiSIMT Ci1 TELts LOCAL GOVjMMENT BOARD
(b) I recognise the argument of time which was responsi-ble for the form of the present Bill.   But the im-portance of a really sound system of compulsory acquisition of land is so great that it is hard to justify the maintenance of the Lands Clauses Acts or the exolusicn from the Bill of the numerous matters dealt with &quot;by the Land Acquisition Committee&apos;s Reports.     Their inclusion is essential to a complete scheme.    Without them many serious drawbacks of the Lands Clauses system will remain.      Indeed the attempt to patch the new provisions on the old fabric will, in oertain aspects, make for complexity rather than simplicity and be likely to increase rather than reduoe litigation.    If a dispute arises on a matter not precisely covered by the new Bill, the old rights cf appeal and procedure will be applioable.This Is peculiarly the oase in regard to claims for injurious affection by owners parts cf whose land Is taken.(o) The Governments experience during the war of the extent to which the development of a looality (e.g. Rosyth) increases the Talue of neighbouring land affords a strong argument in favour cf the legislative adoption of the principle of Betterment.(d) The Land Acquisition Committee recommends that any person or Company should be given compulsory powers tc aquire land wherever it is shown to be in the public interest.      This proposal has met with a large measure cf support.My predecessor in his Memorandum (G.T. 6501) approved this view.(e) Some independent body seems urgently required for the general purpose of making orderB cf a legislative
oharaoter, such as the power to take land eompulsorii:&apos; Private Bill prooedure is too costly and dilatory for any hut exceptionally large schemes.The Sanotioning Authority proposed Tof the Land Adquisition Committee, Toeing a committee of the tiro Houses, with an appeal to Parliament on questions of policy, seems a suitable body.    Their proposals have received considerable public support.    It ie signi-fioant that the Law Society of England and Wales, and the looal Law Societies cf Liverpool and Manchester support the plan without qualification.    The surveyors Institution are also favourable.The gist cf the plan appears in the covering letter of.Mr. Leslie Soctt as Chairman (Cd. 8998 pp.3-5) and the Summary on pp.35-38.    I also refer to Memorandum (G.T. 6432) and Mr, Scott&apos;8 Memorandum G.T. 6677.There is one important respect in which I desire to qualify my support of the reoommendations of Mr. Leslie Sootfs Committee.    The Committee oritioise somewhat severely the system of Departmental and Provisional Orders.&apos;&quot; The system is no doubt dpen to certain&apos;objections in principle but at all events it provides a procedure which is both convenient and expeditious, while at the same time fully maintaining the principle of Ministerial responsibility which might, I think, be in danger of becoming blurred were the system advocated by the Committee to be applied over the wide field which they suggest.    I feel strongly that any question of bringing within the scope of the new sanctioning authority matters of the kind at present dealt with by Departmental and Provisional Orders, should be deferred for the present.      In this respect I entirely agree with the Memorandum (G,T. 6501) submitted by my predecessor on thie subject.
Subject to this proviso, I support the scheme of Mr. Leslie Scott&apos;s Committee and the appeal which he made in his speech on the second reading of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Bill, &quot;iien he urged that the Government should take the present opportunity to deal eompre-hensively with the whole subject - as respects both acquisi-tion and compensation.0.
