/ This qoc^^*t !S(ffiSL l f/    9 7w .0^  &apos; V \ WA&amp; GAB TOT,(l.   r^v^&quot;S      Order of the British Empire. PriHAil Civil Division.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.I have considered the memorandum (G.T.7136) circulated by the Home Secretary,,.   The Home Secretary appears to put forward two distinct propositions regarding the total number of awards of the Civil Division of the British Empire Order which are to be submitted on the recommendations of the various departments of State it\ connection with the 3rd June, 1919, Gazette.His proposals are -(a) to restrict the total gazette to 8-3000 rewards(b) To accept all reasonable claims even though it may mean a total gazette of 6,000 awards.X notice that the Home Secretary favours the latter proposal which I also support as I feel that at -this stage the restriction to 3,000 rewards would only result in much pressure, being brought to bear with a view to further rewards, being made and these demands  will have to be considered and in the long run the number will probably reach the 6,000 now proposed or possibly more.2,    With regard to the definite estimate of 3,482   rewards put forward for War Office services^ it is necessary to point out that this number appears large but the field of services to be covered is extremely wide, and the number proposed cannot in my opinion be materially reduced*   The actual obligations which have to be met are in respect of services in the field, services controlled by the Field Marshal Commanding-Is -Chief Great Britain and the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Ireland, and miscellaneous services within and without war zones which are directly controlled by members of the Army Council,   The total estimate under this heading amounts to 1904 rewards, of which more than half are for services meriting the fifth class of the Order only.   Xn addition, 160 awards are proposed in respect of various voluntary organisations who have done very valuable work and to whom small allotments are made by the War Office,,    There is a further obligation imposed on the War Office in thematter of recognising the services of the many organisations and associations which have done vaulable work for the Navy, Army and Air Force and other departments, but in many cases as the major portion of their work has been rendered to military personnel they look to the War Office for reward and it is not easy to disregard claims.    No special allowance ha3 been $et doewn for services of this nature and there is no means of meeting them exoept by a certain percentage of the individual estimates being allotted to these services.,       In addition! the War Office estimate includes 1418 awards estimated by the chairman of the British Red cross Society, as being necessary to cover his requirements,   of this number 233 awards are proposed for the recognition of the services of civil medical practitioners employed in the various hospitals controlled by the British Red Cross society.    It is open to consideration whether the estimate of the British Red cross Society is not excessive.   It is known that the society has very heavy,  , obligations to meet and it is not easy without further definite information to offer an ppinien as to the merits of their estimate.
J 1 am of opinion therefore that the estimate of theSociety for 1418 awards should be accepted provisionally and should not be reduced unless similar reductions are effected in the estimate? of other departments of State,.but if the number asked for by the British Red Cross Society is sanctioned, it should be made clear to the Society that .the total of 1418 must cover all classes of the Order and that of this total not less than 250 places shall be reserved for the recognition Cf the services of civil medical practitioners who have worked for then, this number 250, being distributed throughout the five Classes of the Order as the particular services of the individual may appear to require., Further, that any portion of this sub-allotment of 250 not taken up for the specific services mentioned shall lapse and shall not be available as&apos;a reward for other services rendered by members of the society.17th May, 1919.(Iritd,) W.S..C.
