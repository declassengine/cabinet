It has been decided to snnd &quot;Lucia&quot; and a half flotilla of Submarines to the Baltic to prevent activities on the part of the Bolshevik Fleet,The Esthonian Government and people are becoming very discouraged at the lack of policy of the Allied Governments towards Esthonia, and HungaryJs offer of mediation will possibly be accepted, as the people will not fight without some definite hope of ultimate independent freedom,The Gulf of Finland is now ice free,Latvia,The condition in Latvia is practically unchanged,. Demands have been repeated for the recall of von der Goltz and that the German forces $should in future be known as the &quot;GermanAuxiliary Force&quot; and not as the &quot;German Army of Occupation&quot;,,     The German Commanding Officer has been informed that no supplies will be allowed by sea until these demands are satisfied.

In view of this report, &quot;Dragon&quot; has been withdrawn from Danzig but S.N.O. has been directed to maintain a Destroyer there.ADRIATIC,There has been a concentration of Italian droops at Fiume, whither it is understood that General Diaz has been instructed to proceed.     one battalion of British troops has received orders to remain,All Senior Naval Officers concerned have been informed that the policy of H.M, Government is that British Naval Forces shall not intervene in the event of conflict occurring between the Italians and others; even if requested to do so by either side, and that ships are to proceed to sea rather than be drawn into active interference.
HBDITBHRAH3AN. 8&apos;-      A , --- ll(7 .All battleships and cruisers in the Mediterranean have now boon relieved sxcept &quot;Grafton&quot;, &quot;Theseus&quot; and &quot;Adventure&quot;. The last named will be relieved by &quot;Concord&quot; in July.It is probable that the unrest amongst the men in the Black Sea reported below will extend to those in the Aegean Command where there is a very large number of demobilisable men.It has been agreed that all the Allies should withdraw from Corfu, and that it is essential that the Italians should evacuate the Island at the same time aa the French ond ourselves.The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, has been in-s.tructed to take stop3 ^or the repatriation of Admiral Hopman and the Staff of the German A must ice Commission, now at Salonika, where there are also about 6,000 German troops awaiting repatriation, under very bad conditions.     General von Hammerstein has requested that the five ships used for the repatriation of troop3 from Constantinople, and toow in German ports, may be 3ent for theae men, and that one officer may be allowed to make the outward passage in order to carry out anti-Bolshevik propaganda on the way home.Friendly and informal enquiries are being made of the Italian Government as to the reasons for their establishing a coaling Taase at Marmarice, and as to the scope and object of the new Italian Dodecanese Naval Station,BLACK SEA MD DANUBE n\ &quot;&quot;W&apos; m,tmumt &quot;&apos; T,&apos;rr   ,IJ&quot;     1 &quot; &apos;   ^mmmLl -Miumi-iMIn the Kertch Peninsula the Bolshisvika continue to attack the volunteer troops, whose flanks are supported by the fire of British warships.     Reinforcements are urgently needed. 2,000 volunteers of the 0de33a section have been sent from Constantza to Novorossisk, and others will shortly follow.General Milne has reported that armed river craft are required for operating with Denekin.   The Commander-in-Chief, has been asked his views but it is not thought advisable that we should man river craft in South Russia, even if the men were available. . &apos;Commander-in-Chief has reported a certain amount of unrest and dissatisfaction amongst demobilisable men in the Black Sea, and has ordered all such to be sent home without relief.   He has been asked if he can spare the &quot;Theseus&quot; to bring the men home.     This ship i3 the base ship at Batoum, but it is thought that the duties of the port could be carried out by &quot;Ark Royal&quot;,which ia also stationed there as air depot for the Caspian.Rear Admiral, Black Sea, ha3 asked for &quot;Furious&quot; or &quot;Vindictive&quot; to be sent out   at once, but has been told that this is impossible owing to the manning situation.Proposals have been made to nominate Admiral Troubridge a3 the British representative on the Danube - Commission, and it ia hoped that he will be made chairman.Admiral Troubridge reports that, under certain conditions Alliafl, preferably British intervention, at Budapest would be welcomed.CASPIAN.It is understood that the War Office are proposing to start the evacuation of the Caucasus on 1st June whether or not
the Italians have arrived.     This will probably mean that the Naval Forces on the Caspian will be withdrawn about the end of July.     In the event of the Italians failing to materialise it is proposed to hand over the fleet, to Denekin*    The Commander-in-chief has been a3ked his views as to whether in this eventuality we should hand over all material in situ to him. but it will be impossible to bring away the greater part of the. material*It is to ha feared that, owing to the enormous scale on which Bolshevik propaganda is worked in these regions, the turning over of this fleet to Denekin is tantamount to handing it over to the Bolsheviks and that in consequence they will be in possession of Baku, within a short time of our leaving it.     As, however, with our withdrawal, our responsibilities in this area will Baave ceased, this could be viewed with equanimity were it not for the los3 of prestige which a Bolshevik success of this nature will entail..H.M. Ship3 &quot;Zoroaster&quot; and &quot;Venture&quot; were engaged with ar. enemy squadron at long range on 25th April.     The enemy fired about 500 rounds but no casualties were suffered.   On the following day the Commodore with four ships reconnoitred the enemy fleet at anchor off the Volga and sighted them but they declined action.An Italian Mission has left for Georgia ostensibly for trade purposes, but it is considered probable that this is the mission to examine into affairs in the Caucasus with a view to Italy carrying out the mandate for this region,wbst roras.The West Indian troops are beginning to arriva. There is considerable unrest amongst the crew of &quot;Lancaster&quot; who is proceeding to Trinidad where she will be relieved by ^Dartmouth&quot;.ALLIED naval ARMISTICE COMMISSION.Submarines.In reply to enquiries as to the Mines believed to have been laid by U.C.78, Admiral Goette reports that this vessel went out on 2nd May, 1918 and did not return. She had orders to lay mines off Newhaven and Boulogne, but it is not known to Admiral Goette whether these orders were carried out4Admiral Goette on being asked whether he had received any information with regard to U.B089 since she broke adrift from her Tug on 7th - 8th March, reported that search by aircraft had yielded no result and that in view of the time which had elapsed it must be considered that this vessel had sunk.All the crews of the Submarines interned in Spain left in S.S. &quot;Frisia&quot; on 1st May for Germany via Falmouth, except the crew of UvC.48,   With regard to the latter the German Government had been informed that the Officers and men who were on board when that vessel was sunk would not ba permitted to return to Germany, but the Dutch Naval Staff at Vigo, apparently owing to some misunderstanding, prevented the whole of the crew from embarking in the &quot;Fri3^ia&quot;. The Naval Attache at the Hague has been again informed a3 to the exact terms of the restrictions imposed.     On arrival at Falmoutfc, owing to documentary evidence having been found to connect him with submarine &quot;frightfulness&quot; Kapitanleutnant Kie3ewetter was removed from the &quot;Frisia.&quot; and has been lodged in the Tower.

He has now replied that our declining of his protest oannot be accepted.The Senior Naval Officer in the Baltio, having been asked whether he considered that the continued holding up of food supplies to Latvia was having a good effect on the general situation, and being informed that in the opinion of the Supreme Economic Council        it was desirable that immediate relief should be afforded to local populations, reported on 9th May that he considered immediate relief should be sent as soon as the German Command had complied with the orders of the Allied Governments to reinstate the Lettish Government and cease interfering with the Lettish Army.   On 11th May he further reported that there was no ohaaage for the better owing to the failure of the German Command to comply as directed,   that the consequent stoppage of supplies and the failure of the Allies to enforce their orders was creating an increasingly bad impression in tho Baltic, and that he considered the best remedy, failing Allied Sroops, would be the arrival of a high British or Allied Officer to head a mission to organise Lettish Forces.On 9th May the Baltic situation was discussed in Paris at n, meeting of the Foreign Ministers, and 1% was decided to appoint a Commission consisting of Political, Economic and Naval Representatives, to report on the best means of securing and maintaining order and reviotualling the population.The question of the re-imposition of the Blockade in the event of the rerusal of the Germans to sign the Peace Treaty is under discussion in Paris.Naval Inter-Allied Goinmissions of Control.Proposals have been put forward for the formation of a Naval Inter-Allied Control Commission, in accordance with tho provisions of the Peace Terms.

0HI.N&amp;.Many of the Germans who had been collected in SHANGHAI for repatriation are being permitted to return to the places in the interior of CHINA whence they oame.   Owing to the non-arrival of a ship to take them from SHANGHAI, and the dissatisfaction felt at the surrender by the Peace Conference to Japan of German rights in SHAMUNG,&apos;the Chinese Government appear to have weakened on the whole question of repatriation.ADMIRALTY, S-W. , 13th May, 1919.mmTho launch of the Battleship &quot;NAGATO&quot; originally intei-Lv;! to take place in November 1918, but postponed till July 1919, will, it appears, be still further postponed..
