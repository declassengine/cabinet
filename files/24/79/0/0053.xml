jociiment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.].CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,May 2, 1919. foreign office.(11229) k . Belgium/004.* MEMORANDUMonBELGIAN AFFAIRS.Passage of the Suffrage Bill,IT will be remembered that the Bill for widening the suffrage, with a view to the election in May or June of a Constituent Assembly, was introduced by the present Government in January because it was felt that the delay calculated at 17 months  inseparable from the strictly constitutional procedure (election of a Constituent Assembly by a two-thirds majority on the basis of the present plural suffrage, limited to men above the age of 25 years of age) would be dangerous to public order.The Bill provides that every Belgian citizen who has reached the age of 21 years and can show six years&apos; residence in the same commune on the 1st of January, 1919, shall have the right to a single vote.   Female suffrage is not included.The debate on the Bill in the Chamber of Deputies began on the 26th of March, and concluded on the 10th of April.In face of existing social conditions and the promise made in the King&apos;s speech, the principle of the Bill universal suffrage did not meet with serious resistance. All parties (some extremists excepted) were convinced that the change was necessary. Catholic opposition, at first direct and based on constitutional scruples, shifted its ground and, either in reliance on the influence of the clergy over the women or in the hope of wrecking the Bill and throwing the responsibility for the result on the Socialists, demanded the addition of female suffrage, a measure to which the Catholics have always been hostile, but which has for a long time formed part of the Socialist programme. Thus a quite factitious but serious conflict arose between the Catholic Right and Socialist Extreme Left. The Liberals, hostile at heart both to lowering the age-limit and to votes for women, but anxious in the first place to preserve national concord, were left in a mid-way position.An amendment extending the suffrage to women was introduced by M. Segers, a Catholic and a member of the late Havre Government; and around this an obstinate conflict took place.As the result of negotiations between the parties conducted outside the Chamber a compromise &quot;was eventually agreed to (10th April) by which the party truce was maintained and the fate of the Bill secured, The agreement, which was formally accepted by the three parties and adopted by the Government, was as follows: &quot; 1. Proposals  for  the  complete application of the principle of proportional representation to be discussed during the present session of Parliament. (The object here is to utilise all spare votes.)&quot; 2. The advocates, Catholic and Socialist, of female suffrage reserve the right to further the realisation of their views before the next renewal of the Communal Councils.   The Liberals reserve their right of opposition.&quot; 3. The Segers amendment to be withdrawn.&quot;4. A fresh amendment to be adopted giving the vote at the next elections to: &quot; (a.) Widows, not remarried, of soldiers who died in the course of the war before the 1st January, 1919, and failing these to their mothers, if widows, and also widowed mothers of unmarried soldiers.&quot;(6.) To widows, &amp;c., in the case of executed civilians. &quot; (c.) To women condemned to prison or preventive detention for patriotic reasons during the enemy occupation.&quot;Upon these conditions the Bill was passed unanimously by the 166 deputies present.11130]  613
The Chamber to be elected on the suffrage established by the new law will have the powers of a Constituent Assembly, and will be free to accept or reject female suffrage and to ratify or annul any changes in the Constitution introduced by the present Parliament. Nevertheless, it is regarded as hardly likely that the two concessions most desired by the Socialists abolition of the plural vote and lowering of the age limit can ever be revoked. The Bill has to be considered by the Senate which reassembled after an Easter recess on the 25th April.General election under the new law are to take place in October or November. It seems probable that the Catholic party, which has been in power for twenty-four years, will lose its dominant position.Luxemburg.Belgian discontent has been in some degree allayed by the action of the Council of Four in regard to Luxemburg.It will be remembered that on the 18th March the Luxemburg Chamber carried a proposal for holding a referendum to decide whether the Nassau dynasty should be maintained or not. The Council of State having dispensed with the second vote, it was expected that the referendum would take place about the 4th May. Subsequently (beginning of April) the Government, encouraged, it is said, by the progress of Francophil propaganda, proposed to couple with the dynastic question that of the economic orientation of the country, although no assurance had been obtained from either France of Belgium concerning the conditions of economic union. Apparently the Luxemburg Government had, during the latter part of February, invited the French and Belgian Governments to discuss the economic question. The Belgian Government had intimated its readiness to negotiate, but the French had returned no answer. On Tuesday, the 15th April, the Chamber was to vote on this proposal to include the economic question in the referendum. After a long debate, it was decided to postpone the double referendum. At the same time the Government was requested to obtain from France and Belgium information about conditions for economic union.This action of the Chamber was apparently the result of an intimation from the Council of Four to the effect that it would be well to postpone the referendum until peace had been signed. The terms of the message seem to have left room for doubt whether the postponement was desired in regard to both questions or only in regard to the economic. It is understood that in reply to a request for information on this point the Council of Four informed the Luxemburg Government that they desired postponement with regard to both questions, since the decision of one might obviously affect the decision of the other.The Luxemburg Chamber, while postponing the referendum, asserted the right of Luxemburg to decide for itself the question of economic orientation, and fixed the 29th April as the date for the renewal of the discussion.Meanwhile (24th April) five delegates representing the economic interests of Luxemburg, have been holding conversations in Brussels with representatives of the Belgian Government, and the conversations are now being continued in Luxemburg. The note published by the Luxemburg Government on the subject of the conversations at Brussels, emphasises the fact that the pourparlers had been limited to economic questions, and states that the most definite assurances had been given as to the intentions of Belgium, &quot;who had no desire whatever to interfere with the autonomy and independence of Luxemburg.&quot;Partisans of the French connection in Luxemburg have sought to make capital out of the intervention of the Council of Four, representing it as the outcome of Belgian machinations and Belgian imperialism. This is perhaps the meaning of a telegram addressed to the Peace Conference (28th April) by a mass meeting of Luxemburg citizens, protesting against &quot; foreign interference threatening their national liberties,&quot; and insisting on their &quot; right to dispose freely of the political and economic future through a refendum of the whole people.&quot;^ A note published by M. Reuter says that &quot; it is not proved that the step taken by the Council of Four was desired by Belgium. It cannot be attributed to either Government. The country remains free to determine for itself its own future.&quot;* In the Chamber on the 30th April, &quot; M. Hoffmann, a Catholic Deputy,&quot; and supporter of the dynasty, &quot; moved that the Chamber should itself adopt the resolution &quot; passed at the mass meeting on Sunday, the 27th April. 11 A lively discussion followed regarding the demonstration, several of the speakers maintaining that it was directed against Belgium.&quot; (&quot; Morning Post,&quot; the 2nd May.)
Limburg and the ScheldtIt has been decided by the Peace Conference that Belgium&apos;s demand for revision -of the Treaty of 1839 shall be conceded, and the Dutch Government has been invited to take part in the eventual discussion, which apparently will not take place until after the Peace Terms have been signed.Internal Conditions.Although better supplies of food and coal, the good progress made in restoring means of transport and towards the resumption of certain industries, the passage of the Suffrage Bill and the improved outlook in the Luxemburg question might have been expected to relieve the state of tension existing in Belgium, the feeling of the country would seem, on the contrary, to have become even more exasperated and bitter during last month.Disappointment in regard to &quot;reconstruction,&quot;&apos;and to the reception of the Belgian claims by the Peace Conference is mainly responsible for this. Very bitter feeling was produced by the decision of the Conference to make Geneva the capital of the League of Nations in preference to Brussels, and exasperation reached its culminating point at the end of April over the question of reparation and indemnity. On the 29th and 30th the Belgian claims were Considered by the Council of. Three. &apos; According to newspaper reports, it was agreed that Belgium should receive 100,000,0001. at once on account of her total indemnity claim of 600,000,000^, payable in thirty years, and should have her debt to the Allies of 200,000,0001 remitted. Conditions, however, were attached. From the 100,000,0001. of indemnity 40,000,000?. owing to the United States on account of food was to be deducted, and it was stipulated that unless the Allies could recover ultimately the whole amount of the debt, Belgium should be responsible for the balance.The terms in; this form were considered on the 30th April and 1 st May by the Crown Council of Belgium in presence of the King, and were, it seems, declared unacceptable. The Belgian Ministers of Railway, Economic Affairs, and Colonies returned to Paris conveying instructions in this sense to the Belgian delegates. The Belgian claims were again considered by the Council of Three, with the result apparently that the conditions attached to tire satisfaction of the financial claims were dropped. The terms offered to Belgium in their new form are summarised by the &quot; Times &quot;correspondent as follows: Two and a half milliards in gold (1.00,000,00OL), payable within two years. British, French, and American loans to Belgium amounting to about 6 milliards(240,000,000?.), to be cancelled. Germany to supply Belgium annually for ten years with 8,000,000 tons of coal ofthe estimated value of 20,000,000?, The actual industrial material, and the cattle and horses stolen by Germany or their equivalent to be restored immediately. Representation on the Supreme Economic Council.The Allies to support Belgium in negotiations for the revision of the Treaty of 1.839. Freedom to enter into economic union with Luxemburg.The cantons of Malmedy and Eupen with Moresnet and the forest of Hertogenwald ; this transfer of territory subject to a referendum within six months. -According to a Beuter telegram, the Crown Council at a meeting held on Sunday evening declared the revised terms to be such as made it possible for Belgium to sign the Peace Treaty .*It seems therefore that Belgium will not, as at one moment she was prepared to do, imitate the example of Italy and withdraw from the Conference.Of the other cases of unrest, unemployment and uncertainty as to the political future are the chief.Assurance as to the political future can only come when the revision of the Treaty of 1839 has been completed, and discussion of this question appears to have been postponed until after the Peace Terms have been signed. As regards unemployment, it is calculated that, apart from agriculture and mining, about 80 per cent, of Belgian workers were out of work in February (Mr. H. Samuel, the &quot; Times,&quot; 12th March)* It was at the same time decided to call the attention of the Powers to the financial and economic situation of Belgium, and to urge upon them that negotiations in regard to Dutch frontier questions should be commenced as soon as possible.
M. Vandervelde told the British press correspondents in Paris early in April that &quot; 750,000, or half of the workers of Belgium,&quot; were out of work, and that the State was spending between 30 and 40 millions per week monthly on relief. Unemployment is due to many causes, the most important are :-1. The deliberate destruction by the Germans of plants of machinery, especially of steel, electrical, and engineering works. Textile industries seem to have suffered less from this cause, while quarries and cement works were carried on by the Germans and are able to restart work. The Belgian press of the last week of April reports good progress made in the recovery of machines from the Germans, but complaints are made about the refusal of the Allies to allow substitutes to be taken.2. Transport difficulties. The destruction of railway bridges, culverts, signalling apparatus, &amp;c, and delay of the Allies in returning the locomotives with-drawn behind the lines. It is reported during April that good progress has been made in the restoration of railway lines, and that for ordinary slow traffic normal conditions have been practically restored.3. Labour troubles. The demand of workers for better conditions and higher wages than were paid before the war 1 fr. to 1 fr. 25 c. per hour, which was a high wage before the war, is now being commonly conceded. Labour organisations seem to have gained in strength rather than lost as a result of the war. To meet these difficulties joint commissions of employed and employers have been established by-the Government in the steel, iron, and coal industries to discuss wages and conditions.4. The high cost of living. According to the calculations of the Food Minister, M. Wauterg, the average cost of absolute necessaries was 291 per cent, above that of 1914.   Food conditions are slowly improving.5. Lack of raw materials. The Allies are freely accused of giving preference to the importation of manufactured articles when it is raw materials that Belgium requires in order to restore her industries.There are, however, other and perhaps more fundamental causes for the delay in the resumption of the industries. These are connected with lack of credit with which to pay for the raw materials required. Meanwhile, for the sake of the exchange, some sort of balance has to be maintained between exports and imports. If economic considerations alone prevailed it would obviously be convenient to allow payment by Germany to take the form of imports of raw materials, but most Belgians are very unwilling to give Germany the dominant position in regard to Belgium which this course would entail. On the whole, it would seem that the internal situation is slowly improving, but cannot for obvious reasons be rapid.
