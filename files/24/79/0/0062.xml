This Document is the Property of7l3JBMISSI0N TO WAR CABINET ON GgfggAL QUESTION /    OP GOVERNMENT A000MMOD ATION Iri&quot;LONDON.JffifSi reference to the War Cabinet decision of 31st March (Minute 552) that I should make recommendations for the vacation by . Department s of specific premise a and particularly for the provision of accommodation for the Department of Overscan Trade, I wish to submit the following memorandum,I have been able to provide accommodation for the Department of Overseas Trade in Westminster by the further concentration of the Ministry of Munitions staffs and by the removal of a Section of the Ministry of Munitions to premises in Kensington,As regards the vacation of specific premises by Government Departments, I would again point out to the War Cabinet that my efforts to release important premises acquired for occupation by Government staffs during the war are still being hampered in every direction by the constant appointment of new staffsi     The total number of Government staffs in London has been practically maintained since the signing of the Armistice.It is therefore evident that the immediate release of Hotels and other important premises can only be secured by the provision of other premises to which the staffs can be removed unless there is an immediate cutting down of staffs by a large percentage which is probably impracticable at the present moment.The time has arrived in my opinion when drastic action should be taken by the War Cabinet to secure the release of large buildings which aro now being utilised for purposes which do not appear to be warranted in view of the serious accommodation situation in London.     Two ouch buildings are the King George V Hospital and the Alexandra Pa lac
I therefore re commend that;- waxTho King George V Hospital and the Alexandra Palaoe be released at once.     It is understood that Sir Auckland Geddes is also pre suing this upon the War Cabinet in his preliminary report in connection with hi a invest! gat ion into the staffs of various Departments.As regards the King George V Hospital, I have been constantly in communication with the War Office since the Armistice for its release, but that Department has up to the present considered it impossible to do so although it is understood that there is a considerable amount of hospital accommodation throughout the country now vacant.       This would accommodate about 3,000 staff.The Alexandra Palace is now utilised as a concentration camp for about 3,000 interned aliens. The Home Office state that it cannot yet be released but the War Cabinet should, I think, insist upon the aliens being removed to some concentration camp in the country or being immediately deported.     This would accommodate about 4,000 staff, and a further 4*000 might be housed in the same vicinity by requisitioning the race-course upon which hutments could be erected.     The race-course is at present used for racing and recreation purposes.Hutments should be immediately erected for about 6,000 staff upon a site which can be secured at Neasden.The Postal Censors Department should be closed down immediately to release their present premises, Strand House, Portugal Street, giving accommodation for about 1,500 staff.The accommodation thus secured would provide space.
for about 18,000 staff which would represent the total numbers now accommodated in practically all the Hotels, Musefime, Galleries and Public Institutions which are now occupied by staffs.The detailed allocation of the accommodation which would thus be secured would be decided by the War Cabinet Committee on Accommodation, the urgency for the release of the present accommodation being generally the determining factor.The proposed schemes can only be carried Into effect, however, if the War Cabinet are prepared to instruot all Departments concerned, principally Admiralty, War Office, Ministry of Munitions, Board of Trade, and Ministry of Labour, that large numbers of their staffs including all those engaged on liquidation work: must now be decentralised and that such premises as can bo offered by the War Cabinet Committee on Accommodation must be acoepted as an emergency arrangement in order to free at once important premises for public use until such time as the whole question can be reviewed and placed on a more permanent basis.The War Cabinet instruct the War Office to make arrangements to vacate the Endsleigh Palace Hotel, the Great Central Hotel and the Buckingham Palace Hotel.The Ehdsleigh Palace Hotel and the Great Central Hotel are used as Hospitals and it should be possible to make arrangements for the patientB in vacant hospital accommodation elsewhere. The Buckingham Palace Hotel is used ao a hostel for BOldiers. It is felt that there must be many houses acquired during the war by the War Office for billeting, etc., which could be now utilised for this purpose and it should not be a difficult matter to indicate the address of any ouch promises by&quot;notices at the various London arrival &quot;stations or by the institution of information Bureaux at the various stations,I have also been examining the question of the permanent housing of the Ministry of Supply and a more comprehensive housing of the Government Disposal Board staff and their stores.
Ag a result of conferences with Lord Inverforth, I recommend that the staff of the Ministry of Supply, numbering say 2,800, be permanently housed in lisp-rial and Oaxton Houses (which accommodate 2,500 staff) together with some adjacent accommodation to provide for the balance of their requirements,   imperial House is already held *in leasei     Caxton House would have to be acquired, some portions probably compulsorily, as a large number of business firms have leases.For the Government Disposal board I recommend the acquisition of the necessary space at Earls Oourt,ALFRED MOND,
