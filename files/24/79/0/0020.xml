\*y I circulate the- following memorandum which has haen prepared by General S^ely.
Submitted that the- Air Ministry absorbs the Meteorological office and carries out the duties and functions hithertoperformed by that office.I have always been of opinion that the Air Ministry should be responsible for all Meteorology and should there-fore absorb the present Meteorological office.    We should prevent overlapping, save money and get greater efficiency, because Meteorology which is little more than an interesting abstract study to others is, literally, a matter of life and death to us.&apos; %The following extracts from a report on the necessity of an extensive R.A.F. Meteorological Section made by Brig.Oen.FrV.Holt, C.K.TK, D.S.O., R.A.F. are submitted.&quot;It was found in July 1914 that although a considerable amount of valuable meteorological   information was collected the Meteorological office was very ignorant about upper air conditions.On the outbreak of war the Meteorological office forecasts became valueless owing to all Continental and most home readings being unavailable.and in consequence the R.A.F. at home lost confidence in them and although they afterwards regained some of their value confidence was never restored.After 1917 on the Western Front a meteorological office was started for each Army and the accuracy of forecasts gradually improved until at the close of hostilities there was general confidence in them although there were still complaints.    The &quot;weather&quot; reports provided by R.F.C. units were perfected after the Armistice when the initiation of the Aerial Post necessitated the commencement of a &quot;wireless weather report system&quot; which has worked very well&quot;.I am strongly of opinion that the successful development of civil aviation ia entirely dependent upon the rapid formation of an efficient aeronautical weather service over the whole world.      If commercial aviation commences with the present indifferent system of warnings and forecasts there will be so many fatal accidents and so many good flying days wastei through insufficient or inaccurate weather information that aerial transport may fail in its competition with the older method of transportation.    Again British weather is peculi4.rl$   changeable compared with continental weather and unless t..e efficiency of our weather service men equalise matters we shall compete at a great disadvantage with other* countries.For military aviation it is essential that the required aeronautical data should be available for training, that the whole Air Force should be possessed of a thorough meteorological knowledge and that the Machinery should bo in existence ^and in sound working order in peace time for the immediate provision of a meteorological weather service on the Battle Front on the outbreak of war.Further the meteorological posts of the &quot;aeronautical weather service&quot; would have to report sufficient details of the present weather conditions to allow the local controller to say whether It was fit for flying and for what types of machine.      The posts would however, have to provide sufficient details of the present meteorological conditions to satisfy the central forecaster.......... P.T.Q.
It should b&quot;c remembered that wind, rain snowden, affect different types of machines differently und there expert knowledge on different type:a &quot;of machine a is needf, as much as an expert knowledge of meteorology.-It is&apos; perhaps not generally known that pilots entirely-dependent upon the accuracy of meteorological forecast for the accuracy of their bombing : \n&apos;air raids, It was fiirther. considered::thatvthe1 &quot;aeronautical weather service&quot;&apos;nuat &quot;include&apos;a &quot;rapid weather report &quot;system&quot; an a very,detailed And elaborate forecast system.     The who subject is so mixed up with aeronautical progress that this weather service. mjist cone directly and entirely und the Air Ministry.Prom&apos; this it will be seen how vital accurate precise.moteprological reports are for the future of military&apos;and civil flying. .   &apos;  - .Reports on upper air conditions can only be collected and published by people;, who have had practical experience of flying.    The&quot;excellent work of the meteorological office has up to now been devoted mainly to conditions&apos; of wind and weather., etc./&apos;which. affect the farm and the fisherman.     The meteorolorical reports of the -^r^sent and;.the itoture must be of &apos;:-vtttl importance to-the life, liinb&apos;ps&apos;nd property of those&apos; engaged in aviut
