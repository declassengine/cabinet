&apos;j&amp;13 DOOtHSNT IS THE PROPERTY 05- HIS BRITAIN&apos;!IC lIAJBSWrS^OW^MMSS&quot;?^SB C RE I...3A - E    0 ABIIB T,FORESTRY Bill. -Copy of a letter from the Chairman of the Interim Forest &quot;Authority to the President qi the Board ofEducation.(Circulated,with reference to G.rJ?.7194).INTERIM BAREST AUTHORITY, Sunderland House, Curzon Street,Mayfair, W.l.6th May, 1919.Doar Fisher,We had s Meeting of the Authority this weok and talked over the general position which seemed to us vory serious,   lord   , Lovat, Lord Clinton and X, an&amp;r-i-fto or three more men who are extremely busy but axtremel^&apos;capable on forestry questions, have been working hard for somT^6^$M^hsre to set going a big National scheme of forestry development. .We have been acting on Government pledges several times ronewed that a Contra! Authority for forestry -would bo established this session.    But we find ourselves now almost at the end of our power to give useful service to the Government, and nothing but a very prompt decision by the War Cabinet as to the legislation to be proposed will malio the work which we have hitherto done effective, or mafce it of any use for us to continue it.In particular;-(1) We have established relations, which I think I maygay promised to bo most excellent, with all the Societies or bodies interested in Forestry in England, Scotland and Ireland.   These Bodies are, however, now becoming dis-couraged and are ceasing to believe that the Government intends to do a^erioualy v/ith the question, and much , good work which/might bo getting started is therefore remaining undone.    As an oxample of the existing feeling . -I quota this from a recent lettor from the Land Agents1 Society.&quot;My Committee much regret the delay which is taking place in the announcement of the policy which is to be pursuod on this most important matter..  It is impossible for the Land Agents to advise their principals as to replanting schomes in the absence of information which all concerned are anxiously awaiting.   My Committee,&quot; hope, there-fore, that every effort will be made by your Authority to. put an end to the present state of uncertainty which if it continues is bound to re-ao^ very seriously on replanting plantations cut down as the result of war and on forestry generally&quot;.
(2) We have assembled a roally first class b^nd of mento act as Divisional Officers uMer the Authority in different parts of the Kingdom.   Wort awaits thorn everywhere.   But we can hardly expect them to enter upon it, or to refuseattractive offers of permanent appointment elsewhere until at any rate the Government&apos;s intention is shown by the production of a Bill.-(3) iarfc;8 numbers of young men who have shown excellentcapacity in the War are wanting to enter on ^orestry training, hut &quot;before doing so naturally wish to know something of the prospects of employment at its oon-clusion.&apos; It is &quot;becoming almost impossible to &amp;ivo any answer to their enquiries.(4) We want lar^e stocks of barbed wire,viro netting,rails and hutting which wo can now get advantageously from tho war stocks which are being dispersed. -   It will really be intolerable to sec all the beet 3tuff melting away before our eyes.&quot;(5) Private owners aro now determining in a largenumber of cases whether to replant land, or to offer land to the Government for afforestation.     Owing to the braaii up of families caused by the Var and to the existence of lar^e felled areas.&apos;which must bo promptly dealt with, &quot;these questions have to be settled without delay.&apos;  Vjfe find that the : persons oonoerned are much influenced in their actions by what they conceive to bo .the policy of the Government on the subject. - Hopes were aroused by the.statements of the Prime&quot;Minister during the election&apos;whioh do not seem to these persons lively to be realised.      It is extremely difficult for U6.uMor these circumstances, to encoura^o and maintain a good, spirit about.forestry emon^ those chiefly coa-cernod, end without such a spirit^chanoes of development&apos; which would hereafter be of the greatest value to tho community are bei% constantly&quot; let slip&apos;.I can assure you that my colleagues snd I have been wording with the utmost loyalty to the Government but I am bound to say that it is extremely important that we should know of the final decision on this matter at our next full Hooting- which- will be on the lgth of this month.Yours sincerely, (Signed)   i?.D.ACLAI1D.P.S.   I co^y say that Lord Lovat entirely concurs with this letter.-
