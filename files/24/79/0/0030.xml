MEMORANDUM gg THE BOARD OF AGR10UL&quot;WE, &amp;,    SHERIESTO HOPS *The position as ,regards Hops is peculiar.   In 1917 &amp; 1918 Hop growers   were restricted to growing &apos;5c$ of their 1914 acreage and in 1919 are being allowed to extend this to 75$ and in some cases even more.   Labour and other conditions will not permit of extensive replanting this year but it is anticipated that next year growers will be able to put under hops as much land as they devoted to that crop in 1914.   The reason for the restriction was that whilst on the one hand as much land as possible was needed for food crops, on the other, it was clear &quot;that if the full acreage of hops was kept up no satisfactory market would be available to growers in view of the greatlv reduced output of beer permitted.. Hop growers would be -compelled either to hold their hops for sale in better times and thus be deprived of the use of a large part of their working capital, or to sell their crops, at low prices to such brev/ers as were&apos; prepared to add t-a their already heavy stocks or to speculators who were prepared to buy and hold against the probable early rise after the termination of hostilities.The whole situation was laid before the chancellor of the Exchequer by the Beard of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries in a memorandum of the 25th May 1917, and as a result of the representations authority was obtained to set up the Hop Control Committee, on which hop-growers, merchants, factors and brewers were equally represented, having power to take over existing stocks of hops in the country (excepting very old hops or those held by &quot;brewers and other actual consumers) on terms which would ensure to the grower, payment, at the time of taking over,  of the amount, roughly of the cost of production, leaving the remainder-of the purchase money to be paid when all the hops held in the pool had been finally sold and the control extinguished.   This Committee was given a state Guarantee against loss, which enabled banks to finance its operations at a favourable rate of interest.   It is anticipated that it will continue its work for at least another season until the pre-war acreage under hops is approximately restored.   Ho call has been or is likely to be made on the Treasury Guarantee, the pool has been able to dispose of all the hops taken over and since grown.While.the present position continues and hop-growers are still kept behind their normal production, it is clearly undesirable-   to bring any additional hops into the country; and for the present it has been decided that no licences for importation will.be granted unless it -can be shown that the imported hops are necessary in order to provide the quantity of beer that may be authorised.It may be added that the general position in the four or five years before the war was that whilst this country provided an average of 353,4o7 cwts, we imported from foreign countries and the Colonies an average of 213/008 cwts. of which the Colonies furnished onlv about 9%,
