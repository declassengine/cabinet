11 r ! I ^     1l ml-. Agg  . PAY. (&quot;&quot; ^ 2HW-v^t-cC^X     Admiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet.In considering the pay that must bo given to the Private Soldier in view of the new rates which the Jerram Committee reoomi-tended for the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, the Secretary of State for War assumes that the Private Soldier must get 4s/- a day, bocause this is to bo the now rate for the Continuous Service Able Seaman and for the Marine who has com-pleted his training.It should bo pointed but, however, that the 4s/- rate only applies to tho Bluejacket or Marine who has entered into a la-year engagement.     In reality the Continuous Service Seaman binds Mmself for more than this period, sinoe he enter s as a boy at 15 or 16 and contracts to serve in the Navy for 12 years&apos;n \    from the age of 18.    Mr. Churchill himself in a Cabinet paper dated October 1912 described ohe ContJmious Service Men as, ii    &quot;caught as boys and bound to a 15 years engagement before they &quot;&quot;knew anything about the Service11&quot;.The 4s/- rate is to be given, in consideration of this Long Service Engagement, which has no real counterpart in the Army.The Special Service Able Seaman, whose engagement is for 5 years in the Navy and 7 years in the Reserve-, is only to get 3/6d. , and his new rates are 6d. a day less than those of the Continuous Service Man throughout.     He is not eligible for the Continuous Service rates unless, after completing his 5 years1 engagement, he re-engages for a further 3 years.Quits apart from the exceptional conditions of Naval Service, which are convincingly set forth in Mr -Churchill^ s Memorandum of 1912 already referred to, it appears that there is good ground for not giving the       so-called Long Service Private Soldier the same increase as the Continuous Service Seaman.    In fact, if this Soldier is to be put on the level of the Continuous Servioe Seaman and the- Marine who is engaged to serve for 12 years with the Colours, it will be unfair to retain the scales at present proposed for the Special Service Naval ratings-(Signed)   Wo H.
