(War Cabinet  14 Minute 7) approved of the proposal of the Shipping Controller to dispose of the National Shipyards (see G.T. 6^43).   During the discussion the Prime Minister said it would be useful if -the Shipping Controller could ascertain if the Yards could not be taken over under! some co-operative arrangement.In endeavouring to carry out this suggestion, the Shipping Controller has interviewed representatives of the Co-operative Union,   The Co-operative Wholesale Society, various Trades Unions, the Trades Union Congress Parliamentary Committee and other leaders in the Labour Movement;   and is. now able to submit a definite proposal for consideration.The Executive of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades hae, after prolonged discussion, now decided to submit to its members a draft memorandum of suggestions put forward by the Shipping Controller as to the  erms on which it is possible that the Government might offer the Yards to the Federation.     In approving this memorandum, the Executive of the Federation passed a resolution to the effect that the members welcomed the proposal and would give it their most earnest consideration, and they are now prepared, if the War Cabinet authorises the pxxjposal, to submit it to a conference of the Shipbuilding; and Engineering Trades to be held at Cardiff on the 14th instant.ITHI5 DOCUMENT, IS, TO PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GO VESTMENT.)
The draft proposals which are submitted for &quot;tho-^pprov&amp;l ofthe War Cabinet,, are as follows::-1.,     That the National Shipyards at Chepstow and Beachley be sold to the Trades Unions of the Shipbuilding and Engineering Industries&apos; at a price to be agreed upon.2*      That the whole amount of the purchase price be paid in the manner following and until paid off be secured by a second mortgage debenture at a rate of interest to be agreed; that the purchase price be paid in such amounts and at such interval;, as the Unions.may elect, provided always that the Unions shall pay an annual instalment of not less than   (amount to beagreed)3.      That the Unions may borrow from outside sources such sum or sums of money as shall be deemed requisite for the working and development of the Yards, such sum or sums to be secured by first mortgage debentures.4.      That the Government undertake to hand over the Yards in such condition as ,shall render the Yards fit to be worked upon a commercial basis.5.      That the management of the Yards be entrusted for the first three years jointly to the Unions and to persons of experience in shipyard management to be selected with the approval of the Government,The Shipping Controller fully realises that this proposition entails the Government bearing the financial risk of the failure of the undertaking and that it could not be justified as a business arrangement.   In view, however, of the present industrial situation and of the valuable lessons to be derived from an experiment on the lines suggested, he thinks that the.War Cabinet may be disposed to waive the financial considerations and. authorise him to lay the proposal before the Federation as a definite offer,As the meeting at Cardiff is fixed for an early date and there are. preliminary arrangements to be made an early decision is asked.(Initialled) J.M.
