Y OF HIS BRITAHH1C majesty^ GQVJSRffi-UfflTrij    \j    v      V   iii    J. tCAe//V&apos;:ikx STAFFS OF GOVBRN^SOT DEPARTMENTS.0, T u * * A&apos;*\i      memorandum by Sir Auckland Qeddos,.My&apos; Inquiry into the establishments of Government Departments I has already revealed a position which requires the immediate atten-tion of the V/ar Cabinet.     Returns from all Departments of any im-i  portanoe, except the Admiralty and the Ministry of Munitions, have been received and examined, from which it appears that on March 31st the number of persons employed in London on work in these offices was 72,058, as against 87,183 at the date of the Armistice, a net increase of 3,954.     X hope and expect that the Admiralty and the KinisTry of Munitions, when their returns are received, will shew an appreciable decrease since November 11th, 1918, which will reduce this figure considerably- but I think it unlikely that on balance any decrease in the total number of government employees will be shewn,    Although the decrease in certain departments amounts to 7,791, tho number of appointments filled since the cossa-tion of hostilities is no less than 18,014.These staffs are at present occupying about 1,000 buildings in London, in addition to the pro-war Government buildings and the tem-porary additions which have been made thereto since 1914.   These buildings include Hotels, Museums, Picture Galleries, Other public buildings, Private business premises and Other privatexpremises, (See Appendix I), held on requisition, loan or lease.    The only im-portant and central premisos surrendered by the Government since the Armistice are the Hotel Victoria, the Constitutional Club, tho Covent Garden Hotel and the Lambeth Town Hall,    The current demands for temporary accommodation on the contrary are actually greater than during the war, and it has been necessary to secure a large number of buildings in the London Area since tho Armistice (see Appendix II).     On the other hand, owing to the impending expiration of war emergency powers, of terms of lease, and of the periods for which buildings have been lent, the Government will soon be compelled to surrender a large number of offices in the business parts of London, and a number of private houses,     Relief can come only from a more rapid reduction of personnel and the removal of as much of the necessary residue as possible from the congested central areas of London,     Close inquiry has shewn that the existing numbers of staff cannot be housed more economically than at present and immediate and drastic action must be taken if a serious crisis is to be avoided.The Treasury has already made a beginning by forbidding all new appointments without the express consent of its Establishment Division in certain Departments and sub-Departments which are/de-definitely temporary in character and are or ougnt to be in process of demobilisation.     This will, I hope, have the effect of stopping the process whereby temporary officers demobilised from one Depart-ment are immediately re-engagod by another,The next step must bo a comprehensive scheme for dealing with the liquidation of war work.     Such a scheme will in any case be required sooner or later as the substantive work of the War Minis-tries comes to an end,     It will not be possible to continue in-definitely the existence of these Ministries for the mere purpose of winding up their affairs.
It is estimated by the Office of Works (see Appendix III) that there is a staff of 19,509 men and women engaged on liquidation work for various Departments.    They are housed in borrowed premiste*4 scattered over London,    This is clearly wasteful both of staff and office room.    There is no reason why central and expensive premises should be used for this purpose and I am sure that it should be possible to complete liquidation with a much smaller staff if it were concentrated and placed under competent single management.1 accordingly propose that all liquidation work should be re-moved from Individual Departments,if necessary by Act of Parliament, and concentrated in a single building in the outskirts of London under tho control of on expert or experts appointed with full powers to close and complete all outstanding transactions as soon as poss-ible on tho most advantagoous terms,    A maximum establishment of say 10,000 should be allowed, of which progressive reductions would be expected as the work goes on.    This would acoelorate the disappointment -pearanoe of temporary Ministries and relieve the Departments which I are intended to be permanent of a great burden of work which is clog-ging their current activities and Impeding their reconstruction.   It Uould also bring immediate and decisive relief to the accommodation I problem.Prom the report of a perconal inspection which 1 have caused to be made I believe that the Alexandra Palace would make a very suitable home for the proposed Department of Liquidation.    It has ample ae-commodation, to which additions could easily bo made if necessary; it is easy of access, while its continued occupation by Government would not Impose any serious hardship on any section of the public It is at present occupied by interned enemy civilians awaiting a hearing from Kr. Justice Younger&apos;s Committee on the question of their compulsory repatriation,    I understand it is hoped to dispose rapidly of the cases of these men, but In view of the paramount importance of readjusting the central administration of the country, I think that if they cannot bo dealt with In time, arrangements should be made to transfer them to one of the largo military camps near London which are now being broken up.1 wish also to call the attention of the Cabinet to the necessity of expediting the evacuation of hospitals in the London Area, more particularly of the King George Hospital, which occupies thp Govern-Kent premises built before the War for the Stationery Office,   This building Is well suited for office use and I believe could accommodate about 3,000 clerks.    Its evacuation would be a solid contribution &apos;wards the permanent expansion of accommodation for Departments of State which will undoubtedly be required.    I am informed that at pros-tat a large number of the beds are unoocupled, and that there is abun-pnee of hospital accommodation elsewhere for the present patients.If tho liquidation scheme is carried out and the King George jog pit a 1 sot free the most urgent needs of the moment will be met. further measures for placing,establishment control in the public Jervice on a permanently sound basis are being conoorted with the treasury and I will report further on them In due course.far .12th, 1919.
