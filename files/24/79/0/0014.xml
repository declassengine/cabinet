From Viceroy, (? 3rd) May 1919. (Received 7th May, 11.50 a.m.) -  .2nd May.Secret. Afghanistan. Arrival of Saleh Muhammad Khan, Afghan Commandei-in-Chief, at Dakka, with two companies of infantry and two guns, coupled with exaggerated stories of Punjab troubles, has given rise to speculation on frontier of AmanuhYs intentions, Commander-in-Chief himself informed Khyber Rifles officer that he intended to inspect the whole Afghan frontier. British Agent, writing on 26th April, mentions similar speculation in Kabul over Commander-in-Chief s tour and despatch of late Commander-in-Chief with force towards Khost, same attributing it to anti-British intentions, others to natural (? precautions) in view of dissatisfaction over findings in Habibullah murder case. Roos-Keppel takes the latter view which seems inherently probable.
