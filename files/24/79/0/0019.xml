Following outlines of Afghan plan of campaign has been received from an informer through Afghan postmaster, Peshawar :-&quot;There are three fronts under three Generals : 1st, Dakka, General Saleli Mohamed ; 2nd, Khost, General Nadir Khan; 3rd, Quetta, General Abdul Qudus Khan. At a date to be announced within 10 days, a simultaneous attack is to be delivered by hordes of Ghazis supported by regular troops.

Afghanistan. My telegram dated 4th instant. Following message sent Amanulla by special messenger 4th May :-&quot; (P.) .1 am informed one Zar Shah, a Shinwari, of Ningrahar, who has previously been concerned in raids in the Peshawar district, is stirring up trouble on Khyber border. He has interfered with Khyber Rifles in British territory, and impudently states that Sipah Salar has sent him ahead to commence hostilities. Nor is this all. lie is parading a farman, declaring that there is great unrest in India, that loyalty of our subjects has been rewarded by my Government by cruelty and injustice in connection with their religion, honour, and modesty, and that they are right in rising and creating disturbances.&quot;Though I am informed farman bears -your seal, I cannot but believe it is a forgery, set up in circulation by some enemy of Afghanistan and of yourself. For it contained misrepresentations of the state of India so gross that no statesman could have believed them. Its object is so palpably to incite the hot-headed frontier tribes against the British Government (whose power has now been demonstrated by the crushing of the strongest Power in the world) that no friendly Afghan could have penned it. In short, it is so grave a menace to the secure position you are now consolidating for yourself after the troubled history of the last few months, that it can only be the work of some enemy of yourself who seeks your overthrow.&quot; In your letter to me, No. I. dated 29th Jamadi-ul-amal, 1337, Hijra, you wrote of the friendship that exists between the two Governments, and in the letter just received inform me that you have yent Sardar Myseur Rahman Khan to be your envoy. Yon wrote of the necessity for friendship, co-operation and mutual assistance between nations. Relying, therefore, on the sincerity of your words, I request you to issue stringent and immediate orders for the arrest of the said Zar Shah and to make it known along our common frontier . that the farmau which he has distributed broadcast is an outrageous forgery, based on lying rumours.&quot;Of the true state&apos;of Punjab, which is rapidly subsiding to normal conditions, I am directing the British Agent, Kabul, to inform you. Your envoys, incoming and outgoing, will be able to corroborate his reassuring accounts from their own experience.&quot; I trust you will agree with me that the matter is of too serious character to permit of action being delayed, and that you will lose no time in informing me that you have taken such action as it requires.&quot;We have wired to British Agent, Kabul, to obtain immediate interview with Amir and explain (fully?) and frankly situation in Punjab.
