Military Secret,900Fro in Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, Army Department,mh May 1919.yj 2053. Your Army Department telegram of 15th May, 6623. You will not Jail to realise the serious luiture and consequences of the step you propose. Occupation of an important town and district four marches within the Afghan border would be a definite act of war on the State of Afghanistan, and in fact is contemplated by you as the possible prelude to an autumn campaign, having Kabul as its objective and involving, it may be, an advance on Kandahar. A movement on Jelalabad and its unopposed occupation might allay for the time tribal unrest, but might equally commit you to a prolonged contest with Afghanistan, in which case you would have to reckon with the possibility of having the tribes on both sides of the border against you.2. The step to which you ask sanction therefore necessitates the greatest circumspection. His Majesty&apos;s Government will require and Parliament will expect that it should be most amply justified not only by the seriousness of the Afghan menace and the degree of provocation but also by the absence of a more pacific and less hazardous alternative and by the results you hope thereby to achieve.3. 1 am without information, regarding the course of events or the present situation sufficient to form any judgment on these heads. I am unaware whether the Amir has replied to your letter, whether he has issued a formal declaration of Avar, whether he has deliberately embarked on an offensive war with all the forces at his command. So far as I can judge the matter may not have gone beyond a frontier trouble. No doubt our administrative frontier has been violated by Afghan troops and tribal levies. Bui no great force nppears to have been employed, the invaders have been easily repelled and their general apparently has asked for an armistice, though on what grounds and in what spirit is not said.4. Clearly much more than this in the way of explanation will be required to justify an offensive on our part that would be tantamount to a formal declaration of war from which withdrawal would not be feasible, and which would commit your Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government to an adventure the magnitude and consequences of which could not be foreseen. Nor can wre overlook the effect of an Afghan war undertaken in such circumstances and threatening the existence of one of the few surviving independent Muhammedan States, on Moslem feeling throughout the East already resentful and suspicious of Biitish designs, and likely to become further embittered when terms of settlement with Turkey are known. Meanwhile effect upon the negotiations now in progress in Paris with regard to Turkey might be very prejudicial.5. Could not Afghan Commander&apos;s request for cessation of hostilities be utilised to extract repudiation by Kabul of hostile acts on frontier, immediate withdrawal and dispersal of troops, punishment of offenders, and guarantees of Afghan Government that friendly policy of late Amir will be maintained in future under same conditions as in past ?6. You will readily understand that a question involving such far-reaching consequences cannot he decided on purely local considerations, and that whole matter will have to be considered by Cabinet before final orders can be passed.
