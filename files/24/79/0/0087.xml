Similar information for the other services is not yet available,Unemployment. -The number of Out-$f-&apos;,Vork Donation Policies lodged remainsvirtually what it was in the preceding week, the increase being only 72; the forecast, previously made; that the maximum had been approximately reached;, is thus substantiated.   There was a reduction by 22,338 in the number of Civilian Policies,lodged, and this reduction was almost exactly balanced by tho additional number - 22,410 - of H.M.Forces Policies lodged.    Almost the whole of the reduction of Civilian Policies was-under the heading sf Women.     (See Appendix 1.) Unemployment fcy Industries.Appendix 2 shews the progress of unemploymenC analysed by Industrial Groupings. , It will be noticed that,among the Insured Industries there is a general improvement.    In the.Uninsured Industries Conveyance of Men,. Goods and Messages, Textiles-Cotton, and ToxtilesrOther, all shew an increase in unemployment.     In the latter the high figure is
accounted for by much part-time unemployment in the Jute Industry.    The Cotton Trade unemployment, whole or part-time, retains the North-Western Division of England as the part of the Country where the rate of unemployment is highest. Wales continues tc shew progressively improving figures, unem-ployment being less than a fifth proportionally, of what it is in the North Western Division.Work of Employment Exchanges.The number of Placings, which had fallen considerably during the Easter Holidays, has risen again, and is higher than it has been since the week ended the 11th April.   There is a corresponding increase in the number of Vacancies Ncti-fied, Vacancies Carried Forward toeing substantially the same as in previous weeks.Juveniles.The re-abscrption of Juveniles continues to shew satisfao-tory progress, Placlngs having practically doubled.Issue of O.W.D.Policies.A statement, shewing the decisipns of the Courts of Referees in cases referred to them in which it is doubtful whether the applicants are entitled to Policies, is attached as Appendix 3, The rate of disallowances,-.72,5^, will be noted, and of the dis-allowances the number of cases in which the grounds for disallow-ance were Refusal to Accept Suitable Employment, (62.2^),Extended Policies.Appendix 4 is a statement shewing the applications for Extended Policies and the decisions of the Local Employment Committees on these applications, The percentage of cases in vrhich extension was refused is seen to be 39.3.A.
