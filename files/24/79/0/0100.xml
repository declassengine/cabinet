ACOOpppATION AND D EMQ T5L.I S AT I Oil, (Mote, by, Sir Auckland Gedfles .) Reference, War Cabinet 569,. Minute I.At a Meeting of the War Cabinet held on the morning of Monday last, it was decided) inter alia, that  (1) Sir Auckland Geddeo should go into the question of the release of the Alexandra Palace, in consultation with the War Office and the Home Office.     The War Cabinet were of opinion that the Alexandra Palace should be released,- and requested Sir Auckland Geddes to report whether, and how soon, the wishes of the Cabinet could be carried out:(ii) The King George V Hospital should be freed at the earliest possible moment by*the War Office.Accordingly, the following morning I assembled an Inter-Departmental Conference, which was attended by representatives of the Home Office, the War Office and the Ministry of Pensions, when the question of the early evacuation of the above premises was discussed.   As a result of the Conference I am able to report that(a) Orders have been issued to move the civilian interned aliens from Alexandra Palace to Frith Hill, Aldershot, at once;   it is anticipated fiat this move will be coxa-pleted by the evening of May fcS, though the clearing of the stores, etc, from the Palace will take a few days longer:(b) It is hoped that the King George V Hospital will be vacated by June 15,, although, in view of the large movement of patients already in hand and the shortage of medical personnel, this date -may not be strictly adhered to.   Everything physically possible, however, will be dona to complete the evacuation by the above date.(Initialled) A.C.G.to, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I., May 22, 1919.
