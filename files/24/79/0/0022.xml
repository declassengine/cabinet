ABOLITION OP POSTAL CENSORSHIP *Copy of Correspondence between Lord. Robert Cecil and the Director of Military Intelligence. vBritish Delegation, Parls.D.M.I.With reference to our correspondence of-the:26th *nd 28th April on the subject of postal censorship between England and Belgium I have consulted the CI.G..S., who in-forms me that there are no military reasons for maintaining this censorship.   I have further consulted the Board of Trad the Department of Overseas Trade and the Treasury, and have received from all of .these expressions of strong agreement with the proposal to abolish it.   Finally, the Blockade authorities say that In their view there are no sufficient reasons to justify Its retention.     I therefore consulted the Prime Minister on the matter.   He authorised Mr. Bonar Law to deal with it on his behalf, and the latter has this morning informed me that he agrees on behalf of the Prime &quot; Minister to my proposal that this censorship should be -removed forthwith.     I shall be much obliged therefore if you will give      the necessary orders.(SD.)
