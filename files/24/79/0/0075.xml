SPECIAL REPORT ON THE GROWTH OP BOLSHEVISM IN THE UNITED STATES

(Circulated by the Home Secretary)

The growth of the Bolshevik and Anarchist spirit in America during the past five months has been remarkable. The following report - abridged from a more detailed essay by a well-informed observer - will give a general outline of the oauses which have led to this disquieting development. The situation is so seriously regarded by the Administration that a Bill of a drastic nature is like to be introduced into Congress.

The new feature in the movement is the behaviour of the American Socialist Party, a recognised political party in the United States. The obligation that all its members must be American citizens has been evaded by the institution of a system of foreign language federations, and the party now derives muoh of its support from these organisations, whose, American members number less than five per cent.

The membership of the chief federations is estimated as follows:-

Russian 5,000 members.

Ukrainian 3,300 "

Lithuanian 3,000 "

Lettish 2,000 "

Polish 3,500 "

Jewish 4,500 "

Finnish 10, 000 "

German 7,000 "

Hungarian 3,000 "

Bohemian 2,000 "

Scandinavian 1,500 "

Italian 1,000 "

- a - - *Counting the other smaller federations, the total membership areaolies nearly 50,000.$he revolution in Russia naturally oreated great 7 exoltement in. tta Russian Federation of the American Sooialist Party.  It absorbed Bolshevik dootrines, its prestige was greatly enhanced, and it was the first body in America to proclaim its adherence to the Russian Communist programme. Its leaders combined with the leaders of other foreign federations, and with extreme Radicals of the type of Jim Lark! in a concerted effort.to spread Bolshevik propaganda.   They had very soon made certain, of the support of the great bulk of the Russian and kindred, groups j   other foreign federations followed suit, and finally many of the English-speaking memberi oaf tlie: American- Socialist Party were won. over to the Left Wing and adopted the Bolshevik programme.Some eight months ago, when there was little talk of theSocialist party adopting Russian Bolshevik methods, a oonventicof delegates from 38 branches of the Russian Federation, heldin New York, passed the following resolution:-Sl&apos;&apos; &quot;$n. view of the fact that sooner.or later a splJifc &quot;&apos;r&apos;&apos; : . &quot;between the revolutionary and non^r evolutionary elements &quot;of the American Socialist&apos; Party is unavoidable ..... it-, (&quot;is the. duty of the federation to revolutionise the rank &quot;and file&apos;, of: the party in the spirit of the Bolshevist &apos;&quot;:*       &quot;principles, and, when the split oomes to unite the Left &quot;Wing of the $artyConferences of the foreign Language. Federations were duly oalled; and were successful in uniting the foreign-speaking Socialists under a common Bolshevik banner.Speaking at a private meeting of the eleot in New York.* -iNioholas Hourvitoh said:?-M$h*H Conference of the representatives of all. our branches has dene muoh work.   They have established idle; Federation of the Russian Sooialist Party on a steady/
steady and sound foundation of Bolshevism,   Although we are still affiliated with the Amerioan 3oolaliet Party, our ways are different.   We Bolshevists oan make no ooinprotaiae with the capitalists ....... and the onlyreason, we are still with the amerioan Socialist Party id because this will lighten our Mission - to bring it to the ideal of Bolshevism.&quot;By means of very vigorous propaganda they set to work to win over the English speaking branches of the Sooialist Party, their prinoipal oentres being New York, Boston, Detroit and .Chicago... Until early in February, 1919, the General Committee of the Russian Federation was at Detroit.  New York is, however, the most important centre, and sinoe February it has also been the headquarters of the Party.   The action of the Psdeml Authorities in Detroit had made that plaoe uncomfortable, and most of the members of the Committee live in and around New York, where also are the offices of the &quot;NOVJ MIR,&quot; the official Russian organ of the Party.The Foreign Language Federations which have been most aotlve in assisting the Russians to create the Bolshevik party, are the Ukrainian, the Lettish, the Finnish and the German&quot;,   Almost 75$ of the Finnish Federation (i.e. 7,500 members) are strong for the Left Wing, and they are devoted to Kuorteva, their leader.Anderson is the chief of the Lettish Federation.   In Russia he was a leader of the &quot;Brothers of the Woods,&quot; an organisation operating in Lettia during the 1905 revolution, and his name is still remembered there as one of the most cruel of these terrorists.  He is closely associated with the &quot;NOVI MIR,&quot;  and is one of the most active revolutionaries, though he shuns publicity.The activities of the Russian Federation in New York centre round the offioes of the &quot;NQVI MIR&quot; whioh are verir well equipped and staffed.   Recently its circulation wasabout/
\about 4,500.   Mailing privileges have been withdrawn, and many issues have been eiippr&amp;Hsed.   nevertheless, it is still issued and distributed to different oentres by messengers, or through the Express Company.    The same press prints large quantities of other Bolshevik material, in Bussian and in English, both books and pamphlets, eto.   These last are given away free, (e.g. 60,000 oopies in English and 80,000 in Bussian of the letter from the Russian Soviet Government to President Wilson).   Theoffioe has also established a regular bookstore.   There are other oommunist periodioals, e.g, &quot;The Communist&quot; (Hew York), the new English organ of the Left Wing;   the &quot;Revolutionary Age&quot; (Boston); &quot;Novi Mir,&quot; Bussian;   &quot;Der Kampf,&quot; Jewish;   &quot; lore,&quot; (Forward) Hungarian, and. &quot;Robitnik&quot; (worker), Ukrainian.. . In addition to the stream, of printed propaganda, other proselytising measures were devised and put into execution.. Many meetings were held in different parts of the country, to whioh envoys were sent to preaoh the Bolshevik dootrine.   At the end of Ootober oonferenoes were being organised all over the country to unite the radical associations in, Amerioa undei the Bolshevik standard, and many english-speaking association were already affiliated,    gain, in Beoember the leaders toolt steps to distribute intelligent members amont- the locals of the American Sooialist Party for the purpose of spreading Bolshevik dootrines.   Soon after this, the &quot;ifovi Mir&quot; was assured that branches of the American Sooialist Party were beooming more and more revolutionary, and&apos;Praina was able to write to Weinstein that &quot;within three months there will be no moderates or Menshevists among the party; it will be forced aooept the programme of the Bolshevists&quot;,   At this time too, Stoklitzky was able to report that about 85^ of the members the party in Chicago no longer adhered to its authorisedprogramme/
hi i J)mm        lotprogramme; they had beoome Bolsheviks, and would do everything possible to force the officers of the party to adopt the platform of the Russian Communist party.   At the beginning of January, the &quot;Novi Mir&quot; learnt that the Bolsheviks were controlling nearly 95$ of the radicals of 2Tew Jersey, and on February 9t-h, a conference of the fforeign Language Federations affiliated to the teierican Socialist Party was held at the &quot;Novi MirM offioe,   All of them had now adopted the Bolshevik platform, and they agreed to remain within the American Socialist Party for the purpose of breaking up the old party and reorganising it on a Bolshevik basis.Local after looal has joined the Left Wing, and the First District of the American Sooialist Party - comprising all the locals and branches of the states of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Conneotiout and New York - has announced its entry into the Left Wing and has nominated its own candidates to the National islxeoutive Committee of the Amerloan Sooialist Party, namely Fraina of Boston, Hourvitch of New York, and Lindgren of Brooklyn.The leaders of the Left Wing are exerting themselves to dominate the forthcoming -Sleotion of&apos; the Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, and there is a likelihood that they will be in the majority and elect their Bolshevik oandidates.   If this happens, then the entire Party will adopt the programme of the Bussian Communists and the members of the Bight Wing will have to seoede or beoome an impotent minority.   Such a change would give to the Bolsheviks the oontrol of the whole of the resouroes of the Party, whioh owns about fifty papers and magazines, and has thousands of dollars in its treasury.  These resources would be put toa/
a new use.   The old Sooialist Party worked on ordinary iuaerican political party lines, and was only active in its propaganda at JSleotion time: but the new Communist or Bolshevik Party would make every effort to reaoh the workers of America industrially instead of politically, a policy which is likely to be far more effectual and dangerous.   The new Party would join hends with the Industrial Workers of the World and other Labour organisati which are striving to accomplish the Industrial Revolution and to establish the dictatorship of the Proletariat.It is difficult to foretell how far they may be successful.   They have against them the general high stand of wages and comfort and the widespread eduoation of the public sohools, but in their favour are the less satisfaot trade conditions in some plaoes and the very large foreign element in the Labour body.The Federal iiuthorities and educated public opinion are fully alive to the danger, and the legislative measures that are to be taken will act as a check, but the most valuable prophylactic would be publicity and co-operation between employers and organized Labour.B.H.T.
