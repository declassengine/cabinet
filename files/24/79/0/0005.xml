ALTffRATIoa Off lltCQI&amp;E LIMIT gOR HEALTH INSURANCE,1.     I desire to ask for the consent of the Cabinet to the intro-duction of a short Bill slightly to amend the National Health jInsurance Acts.     Under the present law persons employed otherwise ! than &quot;by way of manual labour are not incurable as employed contri-! distributors if their rate of remuneration exceeds  160 r year.    The present limit of  160 a year was fixed in 1911, and owing to the ! general increase in salaries and wages, it does not now represent the same dividi ig line between non-manual workers included in, and excluded from, insuranoe.     Strong representations have been receiv-ed from many quarters (including Approved Societies of various types, Trade Unions, and Others) that it should be r?ised, and that, unless this is done, many non-manual workers who have hitherto been insured as employed contributors will be excluded from insurance, most of these people desire to r:&amp;oain in insurance, and I do not think that employers or other persons affected are likely to ob-ject. 12.      After a careful review of the increases in remuneration which have, in fact, taken place in non-Vanual employments during the war, it seems clear that  250 is the very least figure which shculd be substituted for  160 for this purpose.     (it may be worth mention-ing in this connection that Clerks in the Civil Service who would be receiving  160 a year on pre-war scales are now receiving  252.)3.       Tho intention of the proposed Bill is merely to keep in, or bring into, compulsory insurance persons who would have been in-eluded under the conditions of the Act of 1911 if there had been no change xa v.u,\uy value,     There will, however, be a number (pre-eumably ^mall) of individuals whose remuneration was above the limit of  160 when the present Act wa^ passed in 1911, but who have not yet had their remuneration raised above the proposed new limit of  250, and who would, therefore, under the proposed Bill, bs brought into. . compulsory insurance for the first time.     It is proposed, however, that such persons should be entitled to claim exemption from insurance if they so desire.4.      With the email exception referred to in the preceding para-graph, no increase of Exchequer money beyond what was originally contemplated and provided for in the Act of 1911 would be involved, The Bill would merely prevent a decrease of Exchequer contri-bution which would otherwise have resulted from the reduction in the number of insured persons.     In reply to the Treasury objection to this one point being dealt with by legislation until other questions connected- with National Health Insurance can be fiealt with at the same time, it should be said that none of the other Health Insurance questions needing consideration are yet ripe for decision by the Government, nor is any of them anything like so urgent.    The Ministry of Labour to whom the question has been re-ferred, in view of a possible extension of unemployment insurance, have intimated their entire concurrence- with the suggested figure of  250.&apos;
6*     Any postponement of the 3111 would have serious consequences.     On the 30th June next ( the first day of the insurance contribution year), a vary large number of people (variously estimated as between half a million to a million in number) will, under present conditions, lapse from insurance and will cease from June 30th to be entitled to any sickness, disablement and maternity benefits;    and, on tho 31st December next, will be deprived of their rights to medical attendance and treatment.     In addition, they will lose all the advantages of status derived from their past contri-butions; and even if a Bill were introduced at a later date bringing them back into insurance, thoy would have to toe treated as new entrants, and would bo subject to reduced rate6! of sickness benefit for the ensuing two years, during which period they would not be en-titled to disablement benefit.    These disabilities could, of course, be removed by some special provision in tho legislation at the later date, but only at the expense of a Treasury Grant to the Approved Societies to recoup them, for the loss of contributions.        All these difficulties will be avoided by passing the Bill before June 30th,6.-    The Bill is very short and&quot; should, be non-contro-versial.     It is believed that the majority of doctore will be prepared to agree to the proposal when it is clearly explained to them, particularly its very limited scope;     though &amp; few may raise objections,    kany doctors will welcome it, as affording (in their view) a. precedent for the increase of their own remuneration in similar ratio.     The Government, however, are already committed to a reconsideration of that remuneration, and are indeed already giving a bonus to many of the doctors.7.     The pressure on tbs Deportment for prompt legis-lation has for some time been very great, and is growing in intensity with tho approach of the 30th June.    The Joint Committee of Approved Societies, (representing twelve million insured persons) headed by Lr.J,II.Thomas, are pressing kr, Bonar Law to receive a deputation from them on the point at the earliest possible date*     It is certain that if something b? riot done promptly to avert the untoward consequences which will ensue en the 30th Juno next, there vail be considerable Parliamentary agitation, and widespread dissatisfaction will arise among the very large numocrs of workers in Great Britain and Ireland who will on that date cease to be entitled to cash benefits, although they have been contributing for seven years to a State Insurance Scheme which was always intended by Parliament to remain applicable to persons in their economic position.W.AST0R,5th *ay,1919.
