Hi3 3&apos;Circulated by the Secretary of State for India,From Viceroy, Qth May .19.19. (Received J 1,45 a,m.) Following telegrams have been received11 In Mij iw.T 7^7   .&apos; Afghanistan.I.T0111 IIOOS&apos;Keppelij4t. 4lli May During last night Bagh and Kafrkot were occupied by party i ^5(.r Afghan soldiers or kliassadars in uniform, whose commander sent verbal message mat lie was doing this as a precaution against raids by Zar Shah. Afghans have pitched camp at Bagh, and all villagers have run away to Landi Kotal or to the hills. This is a clear challenge and is regarded as such by tribesmen. Afghan possession of heights above Landi Kliana ravine makes it impossible for ns to send caravan escort without practical certainty of falling into an ambush. I have (? group omitted), Political Agent, Khyber, to write Sarhaddar Dakka, in reply to his letter referred to in my telegram No. 1237 R., of yesterday, thanking him for the information, and adding that in precaution he is taking, he has encroached upon British territory, possibly by mistake. If it is mistake, the men should be withdrawn from Bagh limits, if intentional, Sarhaddar will be responsible for any trouble which may arise. Also that Khyber will be closed to caravan as long as situation remains disturbed. I solicit orders of Government as to whether Afghans should be ejected from Bagh by force. This would precipitate conflict but. conflict appears inevitable in any case, and inaction and irresolution Avill have worst effect on tribes. Letters from Amir have reached Afridis, and Tar Muhammad Khan showed Zakka Khels letter from Amir and tried to induce them to accompany him to Dakka, but Zakka Khels refused and said that their course of action would be decided by decision of whole tribe. Supplies are being sent to Dakka in great quantities and local rumour there is that Jehad will be openly declared in a week&apos;n time.&quot;Second. 4th May : &quot; Afghan post office, Peshawar, have received following information from Kabul: ( Amir received letter from India, called special Durbar and read letters, weeping bitterly. Lie said, &quot;See what tyranny (has been) practised on our brethren in India ; not only this, but Baghdad and the Holy Places have been seized by tyranny. I ask you if you are prepared for holy war. If so, gird up your loins, the time has come.&quot; All. replied in the affirmative. Amir said, &quot;I will take no more revenue, but you should all collect grain for the holy war, and rich men should buy rifles and ammunition from the arsenal, while the poor will have them issued on security.&quot; Amir visited Nasrulla and luayatulla and asked them to join him, but they would not on the ground of respect for the judgment of the late Anfir. Ghilzais were ordered to collect the Shinwari camels to take supplies to Kurram and Khyber borders. On Friday last in the Hadda Mulla Mosque, a proclamation was read describing the cruelty of the British authorities at Lahore, Amritsar and Delhi, and describing Rowlatt Bill, and all the Mullas decided on holy war. Mir of Jellaib (?) Jan Badshah was sent to the Molimands, ami Kazi Abdul Jalil with three Turks to Tirah to raise the Afridis. The Sipah Salar has also sent Chaknawur Mullah to the Mohmands.&apos;&quot; Situation in Kurrain more threatening and Turis are vacating the villages near the Afghan border. I have asked General Officer Commanding at Kohat to be ready to support Kurram if necessary.&quot;Third. 4th May : &quot; Afghan force at Bagh consists of 100 regulars, 200 khassa-. dars, and some Shinwari tribesmen under a colonel who is very nervous and &quot;has been appealing for reinforcements which have been promised.&quot; I have asked General Officer Commanding to send emergency column to Landi Kotal to strengthen Khyber Rifles ; they go to-morrow. Amir&apos;s farman referred to in my 1237 R. has arrived at Afghan post office, Peshawar, and large quantities were distributed in city, and it is said many copies were sent to various parts of India. Its authenticity is thus put beyond doubt. Afghans at Bagh have plugged main to Tangi water-supply, and shortage of water for Landi Kotal is serious. Afghan Postmaster returned to Peshawar to-day from Jelalabad, where he has been conferring with Sipah Salar.&quot;Fourth.- 5th May : &quot;The z\mir&apos;s farman referred to in my 1237 R. has been distributed in large numbers in the city by the Afghan&apos; post office. It is thus impossible to pretend it is a forgery. A revised version has also been received which has addition that Abdul Qudus is in command in Western Afghanistan at Kandahar. If he can be spared from Kabul at the present crisis, this means Mohammed (? Tarzi) is in power in Kabul. Afghan Postmaster brought back yesterday from Jelalabad a motor car load leaflets printed at his press in Kabul. They are of extreme violence, saying that the Germans have resumed the war, that Egypt and India have succcss-fully risen, and ending with &apos; cursed be the English, cursed be the tyrants&apos;.&quot;We have told Roos-Keppcl to take no action which might precipitate matters pending ansAver to my message to Amir and Political, KhyberV, reference to Sarhaddar Dakka.
