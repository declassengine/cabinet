WAR    CAB I H E T.EXTENSION OF COURTS- EMERGENCY POWERS ACTS (1914-1917).     * ------.- .to ^Memorandum by the Secretary for Sootland.In pursuance of the decision of the Committee I have obtained,through the Lord Advocate, the views of the Scottish Judges on thoquestions raised &quot;by Sir Claud Schuster1 a Memorandum (G,T.7952) andby the Board of Trade&apos;s Memorandum (G.T.7064).   Their Lordships1views are as follows:-With regard to Sir Claud Schuster1s Memorandum, Their Lordships approve the proposals therein made.With reference to the Board of Trade Memorandum:-(a). Their Lordships agree strongly with Mr. Justice Roche in deprecating an extension for more than 18 mouths after peace.   Three years of continued uncertainty as to the enforceability of contracts may turn out necessary;   and, if so, further extensions covering that period can bo made by future legislation.   But to commit ourselves to it now would be unnecessarily prejudicial to the restoration of normal conditions. The extension made now ought not to exceed 18 months after peace.   This is a leading point:   it materially affects several of the succeeding ones.(b). Their Lordships favour making the new Act apply to all contracts made before its own date.tH (c). Their Lordships approvo. V(d). This is, Their Lordships think, more difficult:   but, if the Act is extended for s period&quot;materially shorter than 3 years, Their Lordship*s would be disposed to approve,(e) and (f).   These are powers which are likely to be used sparingly.   If the Act is to be extended for 3 years /Their Lordships deprecate their enactment.   Butif the extension is to be only for a moderate period, such as 18 months after peace, these powers seem to Their Lordships to be expedient.(Signed)   ROBERT 1LUNR0.SCOTTISH OFFICE, S.W. 20th May, 1919.
