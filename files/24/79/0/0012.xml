nment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Office,Italy /Olf.MEMORANDUMon_ ^ ITALY.&apos;Internal Affairs.Date of reassembly of the Clumber.THE Chamber at its last sitting resolved to reassemble on the 3rd April. This date has been postponed by decrees, first to the 23rd, April and again to the 6th May, on account of the necessity for Signor Orlando&apos;s presence in Paris.General Election and Electoral Reform.At the end of March the papers most closely identified with Sonnino published notes from Paris, saying that the intention of Ministers was that the preliminary peace terms must be ratified by the existing Chamber; that, since the peace terms were not likely to be ready before May, the general election would n&apos;ot be held in that month, but would be postponed till October. Meanwhile there would be ample time for the discussion and technical elaboration of electoral reform, and it was understood that the Government, recognising that the demand for (reform was overpoweringly strong, and having no longer any ground for opposition on the score of time, would withdraw its opposition, and leave Ministers free to take their own line on the question.The paper which is generally supposed to represent Signor Orlando&apos;s views, &quot; L&apos;Epoca &quot; (April 1), regarded these statements as &quot;tendencious,&quot; and denied that Orlando had changed his attitude to the question of reform. The information on which they were founded might have come from Signor Sonnino, but hardly from the President of Council. It is emphatic on the necessity for replacing the old Chamber without delay by one more alive both to the needs of the country and of the international situation, &quot;which,&quot; it says, &quot;does not depend solely on the conclusion of peace, but on the attitude adopted towards it by all the parties interested.&quot; &quot;L&apos;Epoca &quot; of the 3rd April publishes a note from its own correspondent in Paris, and quotes another from the &quot; Messaggero&apos;s &quot; correspondent stating very positively that no statement regarding the date of the elections or electoral reform had been authorised by the President of Council, who had come to no decision on the subject, and would not do so until he could return to Italy and consult his colleagues.If this press controversy reflects, as it seems to do, a difference of opinion between Orlando and Sonnino, it would appear that the latter is afraid that a new Chamber, which, however elected, would probably in the present temper of the country be a good deal more democratic than the old one, might repudiate or hamper his expansionist policy, while the President of Council, perhaps, calculates that a general election on the old basis might strengthen his following among the Giolittians and advocates of moderate democratic reforms. They may have been at one in wishing to get the peace terms ratified by the existing Chamber and have differed only on the question of the date of dissolution and general election. The return of Corradini to the post of chef du cabinet to the Minister of the Interior is regarded as another proof of Orlando&apos;s desire to -conciliate the Giolittians. Corradini was sacrificed to Chauvinist clamour along with Vigliana, Chief of Police, in September 1917.Party Programmes.I Meetings of the Direction of the Official Socialist Party took place on the18th-22nd March, when their programme was formulated:The order of the day adopted at the first day&apos;s meeting hailed the German and Hungarian revolutions as real Socialist movements, and denounced the Paris Conference as being merely the Holy Alliance in modern disguise.[1130]-570 B
The second day&apos;s meeting concerned itself with the Berne Congress of &apos; Patriotic&quot; Socialists. A proposal for adherence to the International&apos; Socialist Bureau with a view to eventually ousting from it the unworthy patriotic elements was defeated, and a resolution carried &quot;to retire from the Socialist Internationalist ^ Bureau (stigmatised as an instrument of pseudo-democratic bourgeois war-policy) and to adhere to and work for the constitution of the Revolutionary Socialist Inter-national on the basis and the principles established by our Communist Russian comrades.&quot;It was further determined to endeavour to obtain the adherence of Socialists of all Entente countries to the idea of the Third Revolutionary Internationale, and an International Congress for this purpose was suggested.The third day was devoted to the formulation of a national and international programme. It is summarised as follows: 1. An attitude of distrust towards &quot;democratic&quot; solutions of national questions.2. Protest against the conditions imposed on the vanquished, conditions which everywhere were throwing upon the peoples the responsibilities of the governing classes.3. Agitation against the anti-Bolshevik policy of the Entente which aims at crushing the will of the Russian proletariat.4. Opposition to all annexation of territory whatsoever without the free and explicit manifestation of the peoples interested.5. To invite the Parliamentary group to display more zeal and coherency in supporting the action of the Party and ideas of the Direction in matters of foreign policy. The cardinal point of the campaign is to be found in hostility to all intervention in Russia, It would be well to prepare a general strike in order to obtain the withdrawal from Russia of the , Italian troops remaining there.On the 4th April the Parliamentary group met to consider the position in regard to the extremist programme of the Direction, and in particular to the reproaches levelled by it at the group and to its proposals for a general strike. No report was published of the discussion which took place, but apparently it was decided not at present to sever the group &apos;s connection with the Party Direction, but to endeavour to moderate its extremist tendencies. A manifesto drawn up by Signor Treves was approved and published in the press. In this rather prolix document a protest against the annulment by decree of a vote of the Chamber fixing the date for its reassembly for the 3rd April as an insult to the sovereignty of Parliament is followed by a denunciation, in most violent terms of the work of the Paris Conference, which after all its grand promises had resolved itself into a committee of four, who, working in obscurity, were dividing up territories and peoples and settling the affairs of the universe in a tyrannical and arbitrary manner. The fourteen points of President Wilson, on the strength of which the surrender had been made, had been thrown to the winds, and new States were being carved out not on the basis of self-determination, but as instruments in the hands of the victorious Powers for the dismemberment of the vanquished and the trampling underfoot of their national rights, and so on at great length. France is stretching her frontiers to the Rhine on the pretext of defence against a German revanche and claiming the Sarre basin with its coal and its population in order to recoup herself for her war losses. Italy is wavering between a false Wilsonism and a downright Imperialism, and haggling for as much territory as she can get. England and America threaten to enter upon a terrible struggle for supremacy at sea. Wilson&apos;s scheme for mandates has degenerated into a simple cession of the German colonies to those who have conquered them.The men of the proletariat cannot stand by with idle hands while this disgusting spectacle is enacted. &quot; Has not the time arrived when in all countries they, should consider whether the general strike, which has proved so efficacious in minor conflicts, may not be the best means for affirming their will to live V The aim of their action would be to force the Conference to respect its own solemn engagements and to establish effective sovereignty of the people. In the case of Italy this would involve radical.reform of the Constitution in the sense of widening of the suffrage; enlargement of constituencies; direct representation of &apos;trade organisations; abolition of all arbitrary power; abolition of the Senate; the assuring to the Chamber of the right to assemble itself; decentralisation of administration.
The common manifesto put out by the Eepublican Party and the (Patriotic) Socialist Union (press of the 4th April), and that of the Radical Party (press of the 1st April), advocate almost identical programmes. Unlike the Official Socialists they confine their anathemas to the Italian Government and governing classes. The first-mentioned manifesto deprecates Bolshevism, but would not have I the bogey of Bolshevism made a pretext for refusing power to the working classes. If the governing classes would avoid Bolshevism they must of their own free will put the people in a position to realise its aspirations in a constitutional mariner. The workers on their part must have nothing to do with men and systems which would hopelessly compromise their cause. &quot; It is necessary, therefore, (1) that the preliminaries of peace should be at once concluded on the basis of the Wilsonian principles; (2) that demobilisation .should be followed immediately by general disarmament and a return to peaceful existence; (3) that a national Constituent Assembly &quot;should be convoked with full powers to introduce new forms of repre-sentation and to nominate a Provisional Government, and administer the affairs of the country until the new constitution can be brought into force. The Constituent Assembly must be elected by universal suffrage with scrutin de liste, large electoral districts and proportional representation. In the Constituent Assembly we shall demand extensive regional self-government and a system of direct democracy on the double basis of class and party representation.&quot;The Radical programme is less explicit, but demands for the working-classes recognition of trade unions, a fuller representation on Communal and State governing bodies and better arrangements for collaboration with employers in] industries and agriculture.Revolution improbable.The policy of the Official Socialist Party at present seems to be to test the solidarity of the.forces at their command by means of local trials of strength, &quot; rehearsals &quot; for revolution and at the same time to ascertain the feeling of the general public. This, according to a prominent member of the Socialist Party consulted by &quot; L&apos;Epoca,&quot; is the meaning of the 24 hours general strike proclaimed at Rome by the Committee of the General Federation of Labour, nominally in protest against the prohibition by the Government of a procession to commemorate the &quot;Red Week&quot; in Berlin and the deaths of Liebknecht and Rosa Luxembourg.&quot; L&apos;Epoea &quot; is not inclined to believe that the revolutionary movement will succeed. The German orientation of the Socialist leaders cannot but arouse bitter opposition among the demobilised men who have suffered, and the Socialists them-selves must see that even in a wholly Socialist Europe, Italy would still be the earthenware pot amongst the iron vessels and that revolution would mean for her not only anarchy but starvation. At the same time it urges the Government to follow the example of Switzerland in undertaking .a serious anti-Bolshevik propaganda. According to telegraphic reports the orders for a strike seems to have been fairly generally if in some cases unwillingly obeyed, but the demonstration which accompanied it was promptly suppressed by Carabiniri and military, andIseveral leaders were arrested. It is said to have been followed by enthusiastic counter-demonstrations. Riots of a similar character and with similar negative results are reported as having taken place in Genoa, Milan, Turin and other cities. On the whole it seems that the danger of revolution on a large scale is not imminent, but might easily become so in case anything occurred to further exasperate the feelings of the working-class against the Italian or the Allied Governments. A further rise in the price of necessaries of life, an aggravation of unemployment (in other words a failure in grain or coal supplies), a decision to intervene militarily in Russia or renewal of military operations in any European field, or a disaster in Tripoli, would have very serious consequences. On the other hand a disappointment to Nationalist territorial ambitions, though it j would endanger the position of the Government, would not be resented by the masses of the working-class.Anti-British and Anti-American Feeling.I       If we exclude Germanophil and extreme Chauvinist papers, like the &quot; Resto del Carlino &apos;&apos; or the &quot; Mattino &apos;&apos; of Naples, expression in the press of anti-Ally feeling has been practically confined to the Jugo-Slav question.   Recently it has .   [1130]-570 B 2
become more general and in the matter of Fiume very bitter and resentful.  For instance the &quot;Corriere della Sera &quot; writes (March 30): &quot; Can England really expect to come out of this crisis strong enough to stand alone and indifferent to every sentiment and resentment of others? Thei news from Egypt, from Ireland and from India, from the working-classes of  I Britain herself, does not seeim such as to justify self-oonfidence of this kind.&quot;The article in which this passage &quot;occurred took for its text a message from Paris (March 25) in which the correspondent had suggested that a British steamship (not named, but closely enough described to be recognisable as the Cunard Line) had obtained from the Jugo-Slav leaders the promise of concessions amounting to a,monopoly of trade in the port of Fiume in the event of that town becoming Jugo-Slav. The company was supported by an extremely rich financial group which was exerting strong political pressure. &apos;&apos; This seems to be the only explanation why, at the time when French and American public opinion and perhaps the attitude of the French and American Governments as well has been brought to favour ItalyYclaim, English propaganda for a Slav Fiume has continued.&quot;The substance of this message found its way into a number of papers gaining positiveness and precision as it went.A denial by the company did not obtain anything like the same degree of publicity.On the subject of international finance also there is much bitter criticism of the line followed by the British and American Governments.For example, in reference to the decision of the Entente not to accept as a basis of payment for Germany&apos;s food, the list of twenty articles ready for export submitted by her, and the Ententes limitation of such exports to wood, potash and dye-stuffs, together with  80,000,000 in gold, the &quot; Corriere della Sera &quot; (March&quot;21) writes as follows: &quot; If that is the position, why ever do the United States, in exchange for the provisions granted to Germany, have themselves paid with that gold and with those securities which are Germany&apos;s one liquid asset for paying the indemnities owed? if this sort of thing goes on Germany&apos;s supplies of gold and foreign securities, though large, will rapidly be consumed, and then France and Belgium, and we Italians, will have to resign ourselves to placing our trust exclusively in the fruits of future German labour in order to obtain what is due to us.  The prospect is not entrancing.&quot;and its protest is echoed in other papers.A Stefani message (Paris, March 22) to the Italian) press (March 23), e.g. &quot;Corriere della Sera,&quot; reports an important meeting of Italian and French politicians and journalists for the discussion of the grave problems of war costs and of the financial League of Nations.The following resolutions were voted: 1. That the French and Italian Governments, since they will have to carry the heavy burden of being Germany&apos;s neighbours, should form within the League of Nations a Latin bloc and take every possible step to strengthen the political, economic and financial links between the two nations and should act in agreement with regard to war burdens, their credits abroad and their commercial treaties.2. That the countries united in the struggle against the imperialism of the Central Powers should continue to work together and to aid each other by every means in order to make possible the revival of the economic and social life of the Allied countries.3. That the Peace Conference should direct its whole attention to the study of the financial situation created by the war and to the special position of certain nations which, like France and Jtaly, will have to support the heaviest burdens of the victorious struggle.4. That in the financial liquidation of the war the enemy should be forced to pay to the full extent of his economic power, and that the distribution (of the burdens and of the indemnities ?) among the Allied and associated countries should be made in inverse proportion to their wealth and in direct proportion to their losses.
5. That the American, British, and Japanese Governments should make up their minds that it is necessary to settle in accordance with justice the-economic and financial situation created by the war, and should unite with France and. Italy in favouring a fair solution of the question. ,At this meeting the following Italian peace delegates were present: Barzilai, the Ambassador Bonin-Longare, Chiesa, Canepa, and others.Vatican Affairs.The Question of the Concordat.In connection with the recent creation of a Clerical Party (&quot;partito popolare italiano &quot;) a fresh impetus has been given to discussion of the relation between Church and State. The Vatican view expressed by the &quot;Osservatore Romano &quot; is that it is a vital interest of the Church to establish not only its actual, but its formal and visible independence of the civil power. This is the essence of the Roman question, which is not extinct. The assent of the Papacy to a sacrifice-of such independence would mean the breaking up of the Catholic Church into a number of National Churches in fact, the end of its existence.The new party, the formation of which was at least connived at by the Vatican, represents the tendency towards a Concordat. But the Clerical view seems to be that, given the presence of the Holy See in the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, the present relation of latent but unresolved discord is the only effective means of establishing in the eyes of the world the independence of the Papacy vis-a-vis the civil power.A Concordat with the Quirinal is desired on the ground that the law of guarantees is liable to be annulled by a mere vote of the Italian Parliament, whereas a Concordat, once&apos;notified to the Powers, would acquire an international value. In reply to this argument it is pointed out that the law of guarantees, though a one-sided claim, has been notified to the Powers in so solemn a manner that no Italian Parliament could venture to meddle with it. The other proposal-to assign an independent territory to the Pope as a symbol of independence would have, it is urged, nothing more than a formal value (article by Signor Crispolto Crispolti in &quot;La Vita Italiana&quot;). The Vatican organs, without explicitly denying the statements made in other journals attributing to the Vatican a desire for reconciliation with the State, give it to be understood that there is nothing in these rumours. On the other hand, &quot;II Secolo&quot; of the 17th March asserts that negotiations for a reconciliation are being actively carried on, and speaks of con-versations which have taken place between Cardinal Gasparri on the one part and Signor Nitti and Baron Monti (manager of the Cults Fund) on the other, and which were cut short by the resignation of Signor Nitti. It states also that Signor Orlando is in favour of a revision of the law of guarantees, and that several other Ministers take the same view, the chief opposition coming from Baron Sonnino; also that the Pope had caused to be transmitted to President Wilson a memorandum on the Roman question, in which it is suggested that the League of Nations might be given the task of regulating the position of the Papacy, The papers which insist most upon the reality of the tendency towards a Concordat are the &quot; Giornale d&apos;Italia,&quot; &apos;&quot; L&apos;Idea Nazionale,&quot; and &quot;II-Secolo.&quot; The discussion seems to have aroused, some anxiety among French publicists, and letters have appeared in several French papers expressing alarm lest France should be left in a position of disadvantage and advocating a renewal of diplomatic relations with the Vatican.The Vatican and the Holy Places.The discussion by the Peace Conference of the regime to be established in Syria and Palestine has been arousing a good deal of anxiety in the Vatican (1) lest the Holy Places and the Christians of Palestine should be made subject to Jewish administration and the interests of the Holy See ignored; and (2) concerning the French claim to &quot;a protectorate. These fears seem to have been allayed by a note from His Majesty&apos;s Government assuring the Vatican that in case Great Britain were given a mandate over Palestine (1) the Holy Places would be under the guardianship of suitable bodies representing adherents of the religions concerned; and (2) the protectorates formerly exercised by foreign States would automatically come to an end, being replaced by that of the mandatory acting on behalf of the League of Nations.
The withdrawal of the Italian Delegates.Before this report was completed came the announcement that the Italian delegates were actually withdrawing from the Conference over the question of Fiume. What will be the effect in Italy ?Without venturing on any confident forecast, we may regard it as probable that the step taken by Orlando and Sonnino will have the approval of the majority of the present Chamber and of the mass of the well-to-do classes in Italy. It is possible that Sonnino will in disgust finally retire from public life as he has threatened to do before. In this case an immediate general election might bring Orlando back into power with a majority containing a large Giolittian! element, pledged to social and administrative reforms of a democratic character and ready to adopt a more conciliatory foreign policy. This is perhaps the best that can be hoped. A Bissolati Ministry would seem to be out of the question, he having no numerous following and Mazzinian ideas being just now at a discount, while Nitti has put himself &quot; out of the running.&quot;On the other hand it may be that national pride and resentment may make it a point of honour to retain the present Ministry and may drive them into an infatuated attempt to win for Italy by force what the Conference has denied her  to order an advance on Agram and Spalato.Such a course would inevitably lead to serious internal trouble, perhaps to actual revolution and Bolshevist anarchy. - The people are sick of war, and without the support of England and America, military operations apart, internal conditions would soon become intolerable. The Italian Government must be aware of this and perhaps reckon on the fear of Bolshevism retaining for Italy the economic support at least of France and England.o
