The enemy seems to toe retiring everywhere, abandoning stores. Sntreaehments are being hurriedly constructed around Petrograd; works have been closed, and the workmen sent to the Eastern Front.The position in Gsrmmy is obscure. Hcny people believe that if the present Government falls, it will not ba to tho Spartaoiste but to a Hilitary Dictator.In Vienna the knowledge that the Allies may cut off the supplies of teoA is restraining the extremists.In Hungary the position of the Communist Government is precarious.In Holland the revolutionary elements are restrained by fears of the Burgorwacht.   Uo immediate outbreak is apprehended.In Switzerland the Government appears to have taken effective measures.There/
There is a spread, of Bolshevik propaganda in Spain and Portugal.\  In Italy, as usual, the storm oentre ie in tho Korth, \\ no disorders beyond wide-spreading strikes are expected.Roumania is still fairly free from Bolshevism.There is no evidence of Bolshevik influence in Egypt, where the situation is quieter 4   The Egyptian Delegation in Paris is disappointed with its reception and is calling on the Nationalist Partv for instructions.   The publication of the Beat) Terms has greatly depressed the Nationalists in Egypt.The unpopularity of the French Government is increasing, and the Socialists talk- of a general strike as a protest against their treatment on May Day.
1 R?(Foreign) 106ffROfOE.   -Military opinion is reported to have boon against the demonstrators of May 1st, who  are called ^mbuaquoV who obtained civil  employment at high rates  of pay whilst soldiers were risking their lives at five sous a day.   Protest meetings have been held by tho extremists, and they are trying to engineer a general strike as a protest against their treatment on May 1st.Warnings have been received that two or  three Russian Delegates from the Soviet Government are expected from Switzerland to get in touch with the Frenoh Socialists, in order to force the hands of the Allied Governments to withdraw their forces from Russia.   It is stated  that attempts have been made to smuggle Russian funds into France for .Bolshevik propaganda, but without success.A meeting of 4,000 Government employees was held last week to protest against the inadequacy of civil servants&apos; salaries.  There was  a strong expression of opinion that oivil servants  could only obtain their legitimate demands by following the  example  of the Trades Unions.It is reported   that amongst the iTench troops lately evacuated from Odessa, and now at Marseilles, there is an undercurrent of sympathy v/ith the Bolsheviks. ,Olhere is a good deal  of feeling against the Government the   stagnant condition of   trade.   The high cost of living .and the largo increase in rente have become serious, and it is felt that the  high prices charged at Marseilles and Lyons, and  indeed in all parts   of France, are ceused by profiteeringAmong the Socialists, President Wilson1s fourteen points have lost their former appeal.    It is stated by a French officer that since the Armistice, 46 separate Delegationsfrom/
from orphaned or oppressed nations have visited Paris or formed olubs there.    The Socialists are &quot;beginning to doubt whether the principle of self-determination, if it is applied to the French dependencies, may not recoil on their own heads.May Day passed off without disorder,   The Belgian State Hallway employees sent-a deputation to join the procession with their flag, which y/ouI&amp; not h:,ve been per-saitted by the Authorities before the&apos;V&apos;ar., -Most of the strikes are small and of&apos;&apos;nb political importance.    The commercial classes are unwilling to undertake larce operations until there is an improvement in the rate of exchange, which is  hojjed&apos; for if a sufficiently large indemnity is secured from Germany.There is widespread criticism of  what&quot;is called Briti selfishness in commercial matters.    The impobularity of President Wilson does  not grow less:   he is accused of placing Belgium on the  same footing as Serbia and other&quot;   t.    .,-   .... Balkan States. &apos;M. Vanderveide   is said&apos;to be fast losing his hold on his Party owing, it is said, to the fact that he advocates sending representatives  of  the Belgian Socialist Party H the International Conference, where they would  meet Ge Socialists.   Etc majority of the Belgian 3ocialists are epposed to this.The extreme Flemish movement seems to be growing.
Aocor&amp;lng to a  report from a very trustworthy source, Lenin has instructed, his agents in Switzerland to maize a -  supreme effort &quot;before   the collapse which is foreshadowed by the failure in Hungary and Bavaria.    Munzihger, the Editor of the &quot;Volfcsrecht&quot;, is projecting a new revolutionary movement to bring about a  Government of Soviets.$here has been a lull in the activities of  the extremists since sentences were pronounced  on the strike loaders, nevertheless,   it is stated that if an application to withdraw the   warrant against Flatten is refused, strikes will break out, and some   attempt may he made   to prevent his arrest, hut he has yet to return to Switzerland.    The Swiss Government do not intend to allow Flatten to return, but no   confidence is to be placed   in the vigilance of the &quot;/rentier Police. The Government is prepared for a popular upheaval upon his arrest, and   even for Civil  War,The Swiss Bolshevists now appear to consider Germany a safer place for   their best members than Switzerland, and they say that as there is only three   daysr food supply in the country, if disorders wore to break out the Entente would be certain to start a hunger blockade.The Spanish Consul in Geneva appears to have started a dangerous practice  of naturalising persons on payment of a feev    The naturalisation warj intended for Jews of Spanish origin who were expelled from Spain in the 14th r,nd 15th centuries, but in practice  apparently almost anyone oan obtain naturalisation by paying a   fee.Events are moving very fast.      In Berlin it is thegeneral/
tgeneral  opinion that a Dictatorship will come first, and some kind of revolt.    If HiUSE comes into power it is thought that will he  retained as Poreign MinisteiThe Pan-Germans and Militarists are making their preparatil for a   counter-revolution, which would   be  tided by the present unpopularity of  the Government.The morale 01 the German troops on the Eastern Pront said to have improved greatly in the list two months, whi that of  the Bolsheviks has declined.The May Day celebration in Cologne passed off ouietly The demonstrators appeared to be well dressed, well fed, an in good spirits.The most influential Spartacist leaders have   set out for PiTvokfurt on the Oder, and they are said to be in touo with the Spartacists in Upper Silesia.    At the 3ame time there seems to be   no doubt that   the Communist organisati has been rudely shaken by the Government, end that no organised Spartacist movement is to be   eroeoted in the m future.    In Berlin Spartacist meetings  are secretly held under the direction of Hof&amp;oann, a well known Moscow Bolshevist, who seems to have assumed the mantle of Hadefc.TEH.Several Communists from Salzburg, who were sent to Munich to study preparations for revolution there, were to have  held a meeting,   but as soon as   it wc.s announced tli food supplies from the ^Intente would  be   stopped   in the event  of  disturbances, the meeting was abandoned.    The Communist meeting at Stainz was a fiasco.    Nevertheless, they are continuing their agitation without interference from the  Government,    There is now  talk of establishing&apos;
Ited Army, and of promising; soldiers 30 kronen as an inducement to join.    It seems  probable that as long as the v   supply.,A;&apos; food defends   on    ood behaviour, there will be no outoroak in.Vienna,* The Communist G^v^rnment is still in office, but every indication points to its early fall.    It ir; stated .that the anti-Coramunist group has &quot;bought POGi-JJY, ex-Cornmisoary for Yfer, who has boon disappointed in his ambitions.    FOCWlflf has prepared the city Police for a   counter move when the time comes.,; Agents have been despatched to Western Hungary to stir the country up against Communism, but so far without muoh success. ,The Communist movement is, however, generally confined to the large towns. * &apos;Internal^ there io quiet,   and though discontent is   rife about the lack of  food and   other necessaries, - there is nothing approaching Bolshevism in the country.    The Government is detested, but the Bosnians are so, inured to bad government that   they view the evils of   the XDresent administration with apathy.    In oputh Transylvania the crops are in good ; condition, and food is   fairly plentiful.A person in close touch with the French Bolshevists has $one to Hungary to   receive instructions for a  mission for spreading Bolshevik propa^and. in Soiuaania.Kith her great natural resources Hour-v.nia ou?;ht to recover from the &quot;&quot;far more aiickly than any of  the neighbouring countries,   but unless   financial help is :?orthcoming, thecountry&apos;&apos;/
country Is faced with bankruptcy in the immediate future. I!AI,Y,Strikes are very prevalent all over the country, but there are many indications that the Government intends to make   liberal  concessions   to the Socialist and labour Part The Socialist Deputies are solid in their opposition and thej are no signs of  any weakening although the Flume incident ha* temporarily allayed paxiiy differences and united the country in support of  the Government.GREBCB.The small Bolshevil:  Party in Creece   ia meeting with some success.    It cdmits,   however, that   there is no possibility of an effective   revolution at present.The  agricultural  classes -   the majority of the Gree]: nation - are generally untouched by Bolshevik propaganda, since the;/ are   all peasant proprietors, and the Government would certainly deal  with any Bolshevik rising by means of the Army,It   is   proposed to send two Greek  delegates   to the Jugo-Slav Conference at Belgrade,RUSSIA.The victorious advance of Admiral KOLC&amp;IX continues;   tfci eneny is   retiring   everywhere, abandoning: rolling stock and munitions,    Yiatka in the ITorth, Samara in the v:est and Orenburg in the South are threatened, and it is possible that the   later stages   of the advance may be,very rapid.Entrenchments are being hurriedly constructed around Petrograd,   where a decree lias been issued closing all factories not manufacturing aniaunition;    the workers inthese/
(Foreign) m *j mthese faotories will be  sent to the front.  Aooording to the Bolshevik wireless, ell  poets now occupied &quot;by men are to he filled by women within a period of  five dr-ys.    The majority of the   wrkmen at the Futilef  works have been mobilised for the Eastern Profit *Meanwhile, anti-BolsheviJ: elements &quot;are secretly organising themselves for a  counter-revolution.A speech by  enin has been posted all over Petrograd: &quot;ffe have only -jorformea&apos; half our task, the more difficult half is new  beginning.    World Revolution depends on the present turn of events&quot;.The Bolshevik leaders are discussing the ^ vantage of an alliance with Germany as  a set-off to the Allies.    At a pro-German dinner recently attended  by russians and. Jfoncs, Baron Rosen, formerly Russian Ambassador in Washington arid Tokio, advocated an understanding with Germany, and favoured a Treaty between Russia, Germany end Poland, with a Confederation of small Border States under  the protection either of Russia or of Gerinany.It is reported that many former officers 01* the CzarTs Army have been recently enlistod in-the Bolshevik forces in the Ukraine.,    Revolts in this        are increasing.,As an illustration of the   at.te.of, scaroity. in  etrorjrad, the following prices are quoted for  the r/th April&apos; 1-; vPotatoes  2.    2.    0. per  lb.Rye Flour  5.   10.    0. n      nSugar  21.   0.

fthe Church In one of  the Provincesv &quot;In Rybinsk measures have at last been taken for the doing away of chapels ?nd sacred images. In our opinion they should be used, first and fore-most, for advertising the programme for celebrating the   Soviet festivals&quot;.A group of German Banks are said to be negotiating for re-establishing all.the French, Belgian and British Industries that existed in Russia before the war.    Lenin ia said to have interviewed the Director  of  the Deutsche Bank at Moscow on this subject.The   following incident at THEODOSIjl in the Crimea is reported   to have  occurred  on April 24th :*..-n Jltaglish cruiser fired shots over  the town at advancin Bolshevik&apos;forces.    The Bolsheviks protested and   asked whetherjfche British Havy was  at war with Soviet Russia.    They received the reply that the cruiser had orders   to fire upon Bolshevik armed forces  whenever and wherever possible and intended to oarry out orders to the letter.POLAHD.May Day passed off quietly.    The Socialist manifestation! consisted chiefly of  quiet and orderly grades of  several thousand workmen and  crowds of spectators.    Cheers for the Chief of the State and the Sntente were heard.The present tactics of  the Communists,   who fully realise that   they are,   as yet, too weak for  any action which would load to the overthrow of  the Government, are to create dissatisfaction and  demoralise the Army and to        I organise strikes.  :    .A secret meeting of. Bolshevik Communists in Varsaw decided on the importance of increasing the nrmber ofagitators/
10 p w*(Foreign) - -9.. -agitators in the foray ami that the propaganda amongst the soldiers - was making good progress... .  They realised that it is not possible to succeed without the support of   the Army.The German Socialists are working for&quot;a rapprochement with Poland by the publication of a pamphlet which points&apos; out  that   the Poles in German Poland have always been more prosperous than those, in Poland proper.The ,,.group; of &quot;black&quot; Activists. (Hakatlsts) has organised a  large  party in Poland which is working for an .  , agreement .with Berlin...    Their aim is to turn the former Russian Poland into a   Bolshevik State, which would be under . German Political  protection,    The activities of   this Party are, beginning   to take   effect throughout Poland.    The Headquarters arc in Berlin.and an organisation is in Cracow with branches in three other towns.A certain number of   soldiers and non-commissioned officers who are Arriving      Warsaw from the Galioian front show Bolshevik   tendencies.The arrival of C-eneral Haller&apos;s troops has caused much &quot; concern to the extreme party.BALTIC STATES^ &apos; ;   ,,,,Finland,The British recognition of  Finland&apos;s independence  has boon received   with great satisfaction.- The pro-German agitation in Finland is   believed to be purely artificial, the .   Finns having  no liking for   the Germans, and the recognition of finland,will be a set-back to the pro-German Party, , Russian opinion is   naturally not at all favourable.   The Russians say that the 3?inns aro treating them so badly that .Russia/
tRussia will not forget it when she again recovers her power, The Communistio fighting organisation, &quot;Mullvaden&quot;, is working among the proletariat to prepare for   another fightAccording to the Chief of Staff and a Swedish journalist who returned on May 3rd, the Military position in Esthonia ig serious.   The Bolsheviks are massing reinforcements on the South, and the Ssthonians are worn out.    There are practioally no  Reserves,   and the recent   losses have &quot;been heavy - doubleithose of the Bolsheviks,    The Esthonian leaders are convinced that   a declaration of EsthonIa&apos;s independence would  ho an inspiration to the whole country and the irmy.The Norwegian Socialist Party appears to he adopting a &quot;Red&quot; programme,   and it is said that -Socialist Members will refrain from attending Parliament, and will resort to violence for  carrying out their programme.      This will mean that the Moderates  will form a.new  Party, hut   for the moment there-is no immediate danger  of  trouble.    Support for  this statement has been found in an intercepted letter to Hew York, in which it is   stated   that the   left wing has   decided to co-operate with the Bolsheviks of Russia, germany, and Switzerland.SWEMT. 0The   situation is unchanged,    Sweden is a main centre for   the   dissemination of  Bolshevik propaganda.    The present plan is to attempt to contaminate the   crews of  ffrenflfcand/like that   they lost in the Spring of 1918,    Propaganda is going  on in clubs and also   in Government offices.NORWAY,
and British ships in Scandinavian waters.   Swedish seamen^are reported to be carrying Bolshevik material to Finland.It is reported that the diplomatic couriers of the Norwegian, Banish, and Swedish T^e^contributions in Helsinefors, being business men, are bringing out large eums of money from Russia..    Most of  the roubles thus smuggled  to Sweden find their way to the Hyabanken in Stockholm, where funds for Bolshevik propaganda have  been kept.A Committee has been formed at Stockholm under the name of the Finland Committee to aid the Red Finnish Refugees, but incidentally to work for revolution in Finland and Sweden.DENMARK.A  eague to combat Bolshevism called w2!he Scandinavian Auriliary League&quot; has been founded.    Unfortunately, a Dane called Bohn, who has been arrested v/ith Bolsheviks, has become prominent in it.Among the Zionists in Copenhagen there is a Bolshevik propaganda organisation which has, among other objects, plans for the establishment of a  Jewish Republic in Palestine.In German circles in Copenhagen, a  revolution in Denmark is believed to be  only a eueetlon of weeks, but this view is not shared  by responsible  people.HOLMETD.May Bay was quiet in Rotterdam.  V/ith the exception of a tramway strike, which still continues, the town had its normal  aspect.    On April 30th the Roman Catholic  arty distributed pamphlets to prevent any demonstration.    QJhe fact is that the^Revclutionary-Barty is  really afraid of making any demonstration,   lest the Bursorwaeht should take action/
action.It now appears   that the Butch Socialists have been trying to   stir up trouble   in the Dutch Hast Indies, but apparently without much success as far ?.s the natives are concerned.At the Socialist Conference in Amsterdam on April 2 nd there was a marked animosity towards the &apos;taglish.    One delegate said that all the English participants in the Conference were &quot;employees of a  big firm, of   vhich Henderson was master and M-c&amp;onald i^nager&quot;.    The Conference decided inter  alia to establish a Socialist Press Bureau in London to work in touch with the &quot;Drily Herald&quot;, and with the Central Secretariat in Switzerland.SPAIH.A volunteer corps called   the Sometan, which is drawn from the upper and middle classes,   we.3 of  great use during the recent strike in Barcelona.    Q)he general strike  is practically over, and there is a movement among the masters to dismiss all work-people belonging to a Syndicate.    If this is carried out, farther disturbances are certain.UJhree members of the present Government, one of whom i the Minister of Labour, are said to favour Bolshevism. The Minister of  labour, in particular, has a sinister reputation,!The new Government is said to be very unpopular among Syndicalists, but strongly supported by the well-to-do classes  as a bulwark against Bolshevism.PORSTOAL. .May Bay was observed as a holiday by the working classes but,   contrary to expectation, no disturbance   took place.Certain/
(Foreign) -&quot; 13 *Certain Infantry Residents of  the Lisbon garrison had intended to make  a  revolutionary demonstration,, but they were dlsbandec and some of  their  Officers put under arrest.mrw.&quot;&apos;.;Cairo and the provinces are quiet.   ,. Ap few of the students  have   returned, the schools have been closed.A Press campaign about alleged atrocities by British troops has been started.    The allegations are   quite unfounded, the   troops having shown most praiseworthy restraint.    The UgyptJUn Delegation in Paris la   shewing what are apparently faked photographs of   outrages.    Copies   are boin  procured.The position of Englishwomen in the  provinces has often been unpleasant,   but no reports of outrage have been received, nor  is there reason to think that any civilians are  still missins in outlying districts.The Nationalists are   trying to provoke a boycott of British products.No traces have been found  of  co-operation with the Bolsheviks.An Sgyptian named Lakif Rifaat is travelline to Switzerland, carrying secret documents, regarding unrest.   The nocessary steps will be taken.A letter dated the 12th .:vpril from a British employee of the   National Bank1 of Sgypt has been intercepted.    He says that the whole   of  the   rising was planned in advance, the 2nd April being-   fixed for a general atriko; that though  the deportation of the two Pashas brought matters to a head, it had been brewing for   a Ions time;   that the Bedouins.;i were not responsible for  damage, as stated in, the Press.This)f
This news  was fostered by the native Press, in order to minimise the share of tho Egyptians.    He gives variouscauses for   the outbreak1,    The mistake made by tho High Commissioner in appealing to Mohammedans for  Bed Cross fands.    They regarded this as official, and  to them the Cross is an infidol sign.2. Tho method of recruiting tho Egyptian Labour Corps which, in the hands of Egyptian officials, became compulsory.3,    Bcouisitions for agricultural predicts and animals.4,    General dissatisfaction at tho highly paid posts boing reserved for Englishman.Ho further says that.the  rostraint of tho troops is greatly admired  by foreigners, but  that tha men arooxaspcratod at demobilisation boine suspended and having to stand     and soc tho natives getting out of hand.INDIA..There is,   so far, no Internal  evidence that BolshoviJr agents have reached India.    Though it s-joins clear that ther  is some organisation at the back of the present movement,   none, so far, has  been detected; and tho probabilities arc that it is -indigenous and not foreign.The   situation in India oannot  bo relieved until tho terms of  Peace have boon made  widely known.   At the present moment tho  most serious nows comes from tho Frontier, and it is impossible   to foretell how  tho situation ma;/ develop or what reaction it will have on tho internal  situation.    Thai is not yet material for   forming an opinion     to whether it&quot; Is part of a Pan-Moslem movement or   not.Mr. B.G. Homiman, -&quot;Editor of the &quot;Bombay Chronicle&quot;, who &amp;as been conducting en inflammatory campaign, has been senthorns
home by the Government of  India.    He. left Bombay on the SVtfc April.the  independent tribes on the Horth, West Frontier were remarkably quiet until the 11th toy, when they began to waver.&quot;&quot; , t1      All the principal agitators   in Peshawar City have been arrested and this appears  greatly to have improved the situation throughout the Peshawar district.Several  supposed Bolshevik  emissaries are said recently to have passed through Kandahar going to Kabul from Herat.gQTOATOOA. s&apos;A Representative Congress of the Trades V TTnione of South Africa  called at the  instance of the South African.Industrial federation as  a  result of   the strikes at Johannesburg, has been sitting at Bloemfontein for  the  last week.Resolutions -were passed   favouring nationalisation of mines, joint control in all Government services, and a mriwm national woefc of forty-eight tours.Acceptance of   the Government1 a, t invitation means a momentary triumph for   the moderate elements.If, however,   the threatened closing of  fourteen or fifteen more low-grade gold  mines in the Rand takes place, a grave crisis will be proclpitated in the whole   South African labour world.mmm-  -Ihe state of labour unrest all over Australia, due-largely v to the oost of living being 50 par   cent over the prewar rates, is taking on a Bolshevik complexion.    One cf  the Unions in &quot;Victoria is reported to have declared for  a Soviet form of Government.At/
At Freemantle, Western Australia, during the recent dock strike, caused by the Government assuming control of the doc a Police force of about 100, partially armed, was driven in by the rioters; the Riot Act was read and there were 33 casualties, neae of them serious. It was finally agreed tha the Government would withdraw its forces if the unions abstain from farther violence, $he strike has now ended and work is being resumed.PERSIA.There is  no evidence that Bolshevik propaganda has met with any real success in Persia, though it is believed that Bolshevik agents have   entered the   country from the Horth. The Persians are indolent and&apos; peace-loving, and therefore lee prone to rebellion than more martial nations.    The bad administration of the present Persian Government might other-wise have provoked disorders long a&amp;o.UNITED STATESA Bill is to be   introduced for  controlling the activities of persons who openly agitate, for the overthrow . of  the Government, who utter or publish disloyal or scurrilous attacks on the Government, or who, by any means seefc to bring discredit on the flag or  uniform of the Army or Navy.    Its title  is to be, &quot;An Act to protect the Government of   the  United States of America, its national Emblem, its Securities and Obligations, and its  Military and Naval Forces It is believed  that this Act will go far towards   controlling Bolshevism and anarchy in the future.    The need for  such an will  assuredly be  felt in this country a3 soon as the Defeno * &quot; &quot;-   &apos; &quot;  &apos;    1   . oil
elgu) ** 17 -of  the Realm Act lapses *The- left wing In the -Socialist Party continues to gain ground, end it is quite possible that it will recapture the main tody of the /oaerican Sooialists.    If this happens, the old platform will go, and tho new one, constructed on Bolshevik principles  and devoted to revolutionary action, will take  its  place.   Its   policy will then ho almost identical  with that of the   Industrial Workers cf the World. During  the   last few months, strikes have been numerous and are taking on mere and more  a  revolutionary complexion. The propaganda of the tetreme Socialists   exceeds anything of the   sort in other  countries.    It is reported that a conspiracy is on foot to inaugurate a general   strike on July 4th.On the other hand, the  -American Federation of labour Is waking up  to   the  dangers of Bolshevism and among employers there  is   a foiling of  uneasiness.    Labour matters  in Croat Britain react strongly on radical movements in the  United $tates,A remarkable exodue of foreign wortosn is taking plaoe from the Eastern Ports,    It is   estimated that more  than a million may leave,   Tho reason given is that owing; to Pe&amp;oe many people have an opportunity of returning home. It is posslblo that the  rising expectations  of revolu-tionaries have given an impetus to the exodus, for most of the returning emigrants  are taking considerable  sums in United States currency with them.A letter,  written by a notorious Bolshevik in Buseia to a  Bolshevik leader in a neutral country, contains the following significant phrase, written two months ago &quot;The Japanese are helping us in America like nobody else*,S6UTE/
SOUTH AMERICA.SPhougb no improvement has taken place in the labour situation in the Argentine, public feeling is. much (juieter. The demands of different labour Associations are being- *       &quot;1. &apos; .-v&apos;,&apos; t&apos; * 1 ;aooepted by the   &quot;arploycrs.The  labour Agitation following the 1st of May oelobrations  is anticipated about May StOth.B.
