The number of Out-of-Work donation policies lodged TncreasebTTrom 1,086,429 to 1,095,328 i.e. by 6,899 or 0.63$ during the week ending April 25th.     The total number reported as lodged on April 25th is known to be low owing to the non-receipt of complete returns of policies lodged under the short-time scheme at Dundee,, the estimated number, under this scheme, which requires to be added to the above total is 7,000.     Even with this addition the increase for the week is small and further indicates a marked slackening in the increase of unemployment.The numbers on the live registers increased during the week by 1.02? as compared with an increase of 2.03$ last week.Comparative figures for the last three weeks are shewn below:-

Forces,   The increase this week in the number of demobilised men drawing the donation is not so great as in the previous week and this further suggests that the fluctuation in the increase in the numbers of policies lodged by H.k.Forces will continue owing to the varying proportion of demobilised men who have no work awaiting them on their return.appendix 2, gives analysis of policies lodged by Industries,     A fur-frier decline is shewn in the insured industries and an increase in the uninsured group.In the insured group it will be noticed that the rise in unemployment in the Building and Works of Construction Group was only temporary, the number this week having fallen,There is a further roduction in the numbers unemployed in the Engineering and Ironfounding Group and in Bricks, Tiles &amp;c,After falling for several weeks past, there is a consider-able increase of unemployment in the Iron and Steel trade; in-creases will also be noted in Construction of Vehicles and in Metal Manufacture,The Uninsured Industries again shew a rise of unemployment which has been evenly Inaintained for the past month.The improvement recorded last week in the Cotton Trade is not maintained, the figure having risen to the level of the previous week.    There is a rise in unemployment in Conveyance of men, goods and messages.A substantial decrease is shewn in the General Labourers, Factory Workers etc. Group.In tho divisions unemployment is increasing again in North Western Division,   Increases are also seen in the figures for -Jest Midlands and Northern; with regard to these two Divisions it should be noted that this increase follows a steady fall for the past few weeks.
