Owing to the cold weather, spring growth is very backward, and although some damage was done to fruit tree53 &quot;by the recent snow-storm, the damage generally is not very great and is loss than was anticipated.     Pastures still show little growth, and there is a shortage of keep.Towards the end of the week there was an improvement in the weather, which is now milder and more favourable for farm work. .Land Division *(i) Land   -Settlement.Applications for Small Holdings.

The owner of the land had in January last offered to the County Council the whole estate of 1,600 acres, of which the land which was the subject of the Enquiry formed part.    This offer was not accepted by the Council. At the Enquiry other land was offered which was considered suitable by the Commissioner, but the Council would not accept it.    The Board have asked the owner of the estate if he would be willing to transfer his original ,-jffer of the property to them for the purpose of a Farm Settlement.The Board received notifications of Orders made by County Councils for the compulsory purchase of the undermentioned lands:-

The area of land squired for admini stralion by The&quot; Board&quot; itself is 12,267 acres, lere arc now 1&amp;2 ex-service men on the Farm settlements.    This uuber includes men who are actually in possession of holding a and n who are working on the central farm.At Hcjjrt2LjjI.il land work has been greatly retarded by the bad sat her -     Vfhat little work has been dene on the land has consisted of 11j ng wheat and oats,     hi Patringtcn the very bad weather has :eatiy retarded spring growth.

An application was made by the incashire Agricultural uHxacutive Committee for an order tc determine e tenancy cf Gat hurst Farm, near Y/igan, which was reported to be in deplorable condition-     Correspondence ensued with the landlord&apos;s2ncswho undertook that the farm should be properly cultivated in
future, and the Board are now informed that the farm has been let tc a new tenant who is reputed to be an exceedingly good tor, and consequently no furth. r action by tho Beard is n^eossary.Ghcrt Tjjrm Credit *    The Treasury have decided that they cannot set.; th ir way to authorise an extension of tho Credit Scheme for a further period subsequent to tho 31st march, 1919, and tho Board have therefore been compelled to inform the Agricultural Executive Committ* es that no fr- sh applications for credit should bo approved until furth: r notice.     Committees have been advised to refer applicants for credit to th&apos; ir Bankers with a view to obtaining financial accommodation, if possible, without the Government guarantee.Possession of Cottages *    The Inorease, of Rent etc. (Amendment) Act, 1918, prevented the landlord of a dwelling house to which the principal Act applied who had become the landlord since the 30th September, 1917, from obtaining an order for recovery of possession unless a certificate v;as given by or on behalf of tho Board that the premises in question were required for the occupation of a person engaged or employed in agricultural work of urgent national importance. A considerable number of applications for certificates have been reooivod during tho last twelve months, and referred to the Agricultural Executive Committees for a report.     The effect of Section 5 (2) of the Increase of Rent and mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1919, is to render iit unnecessary for the Beard to continue issuing certificates, and to give the Court discretionary power to make an Ejectment Order subject to tho terms of the principal Act and the amending Act.(iii) Land Drainage.The purchase of new and second-hand dredgers for the Great Ouse is progressing.     It is hoped to have one or possibly two second-hand dredgers at work in a few weeks, and to have at least one new dredger delivered by August 1st.Important work has been completed in the North Riding (Bellasi3e Drain), and a full report on work completed, in hand, and contemplated in the Riding is being prepared.(iv) Tithe, Copyhold, Commons and Survey.The number of applications for redemption continues to shew a substantial increase as compared with previous years.

the regulation of Coity Wallia Commons in the County of Glamorgan. The Commons comprise 2,627 acres and lie within the &quot;Penyhcnt Rural District.     The chief objects of the application are to put a stop to the encroachments that havo been and are boing made in large numbers by sqatters, to secure the use of tho Commons to the Commoners and for&apos; public recreation, and to improve the pasturage.    It is anticipated that a Select Committee: will &quot;be sot up in the course of the next few days to consider the Board&apos;s report with a view to tho presentation before &quot;Thitsuntide of a Bill confirming the Board&apos;s Provisional Order.Commercial Division.Building Section.Materials- and Fittings.    Visits havo been made to a number of range makers, joinery firms, and steel casement manufacturers with a view to the selection of suitable and standardised fittings for houses and buildings for small holdings.     The Building Materials Supply Department has been consulted in regard to the provision of these and other materials and fittings. &apos;/The great convenience of a supply of hot water in small holdings cottages, particularly in the case of dairy holdings, has engaged special attention.     In isolated districts, where there is no water supply, a scheme has been devised for the storage of filtered rain water, the storage tank being constructed on the same lines as tjaft. liquid manure tanks, which are illustrated in Leaflet F.P.449/S.1. A simple pump will raise the water into a hot water storage tank,, which will be heated by a boiler forming part of the living room range. The system is a low pressure one, and special care has been takejj to make it &quot;fool-proof&quot;, so that the boiler cannot be run dry, and burnt out.    There is no possibility of explosion.Four firms of range makers are now working on this suggested arrangement with a view to modifying existing types of ranges to give the increased heating surface in the boiler asked for, and one firm has arranged to fit the whole apparatus up in their London Bhowrooms for a practical test.    The interest shown by these firms and their recognition that a great advance is.required in regard to the provision of hot water for rural cottages is satisfactory, and it does not appear that the nocessary fittings will be materially more costly than tho&apos;; ordinary equipment of range and copper.Design of Farm Institutes.    The planning of buildings for Farm: Institutes is a subject that has been much neglected.    Typical plaris are boing prepared in order that they may be available as a basis foy consideration by Trustees and others proposing to build.     One -%application for such plans    &apos; has been received.Fertilisers,   The Superphosphate makers have not been able to agree on any   uniform price applicable to the country as a whole, but it is expected that prices will be settled for different districts on the lines adopted in pre-war days. Although a rise of about  1 per ton will probably be necessary consequent on the removal of the subsidy, there is no doubt that makers will use every effort to keep prices as low as possible for fear that farmers will refuse to buy.The agricultural demand for potash is now practically over, but small parcels are reported to be arriving in this country from Alsace,     The arrangements for tho supply cf 30,000 tons of Potash from Germany (in exchange for food) whichwsre provisionally made by the Ministry of Munitions som^ time ago have not yet been carried into effect.
lee dim:; stuffs.    The principal Orders of the Ministry of Food relating to feeding stuffs hays been withdrawn and the trade is now free of control.     Supplies of oil-cake this year have so far been fairly plentiful though not equal to the demand, and prices ought &quot;, not to show an immediate rise.    The linseed and cottonseed prospects are not good and a shortage of supplies with a consequent rise in prices appears likely later in the year.    The stocks of millers&apos; offals which were causing congestion in the mills some time ago have now been cleared,     In view of the uncertainty of future imports no export of feeding stuffs is being allowed.Seed,Oats.     The total quantity of     - soad. oats which have been ehippod to trance is 18,669 tons 6 cwt,1?1M..9.1.33 e&apos;d g.....Order919.   Special steps are being taken toascertain the general quality of &quot;the garden seeds which are supplied in small seeled packets by firms who make a speciality of their packet trade.    Over 1.500 packets have been taken up to date this season by inspectore under the Order, and it is proposed to have these tert-ed w soon ae- the seasonal rush is over at the Official Station. The d:i fcuity with packets is that many small shopkeepers carry over urjeei/J eceats from year to year.     In several cases supplies of these old packets of low germinating seed have been withdrawn from sale on representations being made to the sellers concerned.Horticultural Division.Cultivation Section, ^ -HoTteach^      A fruit foreman has now been obtained for the Holbeach Crown Settlement.Sussex.    Visits have been paid to a small holding at Slinfold and Rudg?iick Fruit Farm, near Eoi saaml     The former contains 2% acres of orchard in a badly neglected condition as tho result of having changed hands several times in the past few years.

The skins of the rabbits are dried and graded on th-  premises and disposed of to the best market, as also are the feathers of the birds.     As a result oi. this enterprise large numbers of people who have not previously kept rabbits or poultry   are now doing so.Technical and Cultivation Division,Technical Section.Inspection of Land.     At the request of the Agricultural Executive Committee, a visit was paid to an estate of about 2,000 acres in Derby-shire which has recently been acquired by a Syndicate,     It is divided into 17 holdings (largest about 260 acres) and is mostly under grass, though the majority of the holdings contain some arable cn which corn and roots are successfully cultivated.     Under the former owner, the land was farmed mainly for the production of milk, for which the proximity o,f Derby and the existence of a cooperative dairy in the vicinity offered a ready moans of disposal.     The recent transfer of the property has resulted in great disturbance to the tenants.     The syndicate have in most cases redistributed the fields among the several holdings and have attempted to sell, both privately and at public auction.     So far, sales amounting to about 674 acres have been effected.     In for;, if any, instances have the former tenants been able to purchase their holdings,   exorbitant prices, in some instances , 150 an acre, have been asked by the vendors.     In scveralcoses where: sales have not been effected, tho sitting tenants have been allowed to nmain on short agreements of from 3 to 9 months, generally at enhanced rents.     The result has been a widespread disposal of milking herds, 155 cows having been sold and not replaced since February of last year, while a further 110 are affected by sales at present advertised.     This means a serious loss to the community and is hpund to re-act on the general productivity of the farms, but in the circumstances it is difficult to suggest a suitable remedy. Probably the best plan would be for the Executive Committee to take possession of vacant or neglected land and farm it themselves, but this they arc not disposed tc do owing to the difficulties of the . labour position.Spontaneous Keating in Hay Stacks.     In view of the soarcity of ; data concerning the temperature changes that take place during the-normal and abnormal fermentation of hay in the stack, the Technical Committee set on foot a number of systematic observations last season. A scheme was drawn up and arrangements made for recording haystack temperatures at five centres, viz:- ITowton Higg, V/oking, Leeds, Bangor,

Rothamsted.    The results have now been summarised, and a report prepared for publication in the Board&apos;s Journal.    The records so far obtained may thus be summed up:-   (a) Hay with a low moisture content -15 to 16$ - exhibits little fermentation in the stack;    (b) hay with a high moisture content (26$) but subjected to prolonged weathering before stacking, shows only moderate sweating in the stack;    (c) hay with a moderately high v^ater content (23$) and harvested in good condition shows a rise of temperature up to 126 - 1340;   (d) hay that has been subjected to a temperature of 1490 and upwards shows marked discoloration and suffers in consequence.The investigation vail be continued during the coming season.Seed Testing Station.    During- April, 2,262 samples have been received;   this docs not&quot;&quot;show such a falling off from the March total (3,758 samples) as might have bet-n expected, and represents three times as many samples as were received during the same month last year.Tractor Section.During the week ended the 18th April, 3,493 tractors were in the hands of Committees, and 1,037 of these were being operated under the now contract scheme.     Of the 2,456 operated by the Committoes directly, reports were racei/ved in resxject of 2,311.    Of these. 178 were being got ready for sale, leaving 2,133 available:   1.251 (or 59$) were in commission but wore idle for half the time on account of bad weather, 506 wore idle for lack of work, 323 were under repair and 53 were not being operated for lack of labour.In England and Wales 5.218 acres were ploughed and 7,719 cultivated by 1,620 tractors, giving an average of 3.22 acres and 4.76 acres respectively.    Of this acreage about one-third of both the ploughing and cultivating was done in the fourteen counties which are working under the new contract scheme.    The total acreage dealt with was about 50$ less than the previous week for all operations.     The highest average was again recorded in the Holland Division of Lincolnshire where 41 tractors ploughed 87 acres and cultivated 1,289; average 2.12 acres and 31.44 acres respectively.During the week the proposals of the Soke of Peterborough Committee to discontinue the Tractor Scheme at the end of this month have been approved, as well as those of the too mouth Committee to sell 30 tractors on the 31 *t ;,.rut., and to continue working the remaining 18 after that date.    Cc-ixaJn Committees have revised their proposals and the number of tractors to be retained after the end of May is now approximately 1.250.Mechanic aJL    c tjjm..As a renult of the shortage of labour, it has been found necessary in some- districts to place learners upon tractors, and the Department&apos;&amp; Inspectors report that owing to the inexperience of these men the proportion of breakages has considerably increased.Reports from Inspectors indicate that the Fordson Tractor is generally more popular with farmers mainly on account of its weight and cdaolabjlyty for general cultivation purposes and harvesting:   a tractor of not more; than 25 owts. is considered by them to be more suitable for spring ploughing .
Requirements and Disposal Section.During the week ended the 3rd May, returns of sales have been received from Bucks, Pembroke, Salop, Carmarthen, West Riding, West Sussex, Wiltshire, Leicester, Cornwall.

Fordson and Titan tractors realised about  200,     Binders realised from  35 to  60 according to make, notwithstanding the fact that there are fair?.y good supplies in the hands of agents.     At a sale held at Hinekley two farm carts fetched  38 and  42 respectively.   Other implements are selling well.Assistance is being given to other Divisions in the . Department in the purchase of machinery supplies.Up to date 4.723 surplus horses have been sold.     The average price obtained for 98 hordes during the past week was  94.Arrangements so far have been made for the sale during, the month of 600 horses,, and it is anticipated that this number will be largely increased.The first case of glanders among the Department-s horses has occurred in Warwick.3ii.ir3 at a prisoner of war camp at Brailss. There is no reason to supoose that it will spread from that oamp, as the horses have been confined to that area, and have not been oi loan to farmers.    Meanwhile, the arrangements for sales of surplus horses in Warwickshire have been suspended.Svjaia Tackle Section.Hoturns received during the week ending 27th April show that 3,734 acres were ploughed, 10,804 cultivated, 3,162 harrowed ana 503 mole drained, making a total of 16,203 implement acres,The work has been fairly evenly distributed over the counties, Iruio slash.*.re, Berkshire and Yorkshire showing the largest acreage worked * ?The mole draining was carried out in Essex, Bedfordshireand Northants. .

Such man will be returned to their employers for the extended period.if-o     - -The War Cabinet have now decided that 10 per cent, of the soldiers on the land are to be retained, the selection being left to the County Agricultural Executive Committeett-o    This concession will enable the Committees to meet a limited number of the hardest cases.    A short further extension of furlough has been given to the men attached to the Agricultural Companies to give time for the selection to be made*    As regards the men who belong to the Companies, the withdrawal of all those not selected for retention will commenoe on the 28th instant and be completed   on the 5th June.Women&apos;s Branch.The Government Overseas Settlement Committee have decided to send out six women commissioners, two to visit the several Dominions of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.    They are to make an exhaustive enquiry into the openings for women either as land workers, farmers or in any other industry, with a special view to the settlement in those Dominions of ex-service women. Two members of the Staff of the Women1s Branch have been already appointed as commissioners;   Miss Gladys Pott and Miss Watkin, the former for Canada and the latter for New Zealand.The Timber Supply Department of the Board of Trade have decided to demobilise the Timber Cutting Section cf the Land Army.    A certain number of the women cf the-Agricultural Section have been lent to do the timber cutting work;   these will new return to the Agricultural Section, while all the women in the Timber Cutting Section will be given the opportunity of remaining in the Land Army - now composed of the Agricultural Section only.The farmers in Staffordshire have recently received a circular letter from the Women&apos;a Agricultural Committee in the County, in which three questions were put to them:-(1) Have you in your einployment any Land &quot;Army women whom you consider of sufficient value to be retained permanentlyj   and if so, give name?
Out of 120 replies received the names of 83 members *  the Land Army have been sent forward.(2) Is there any branch cf farm work for which you would employ a woman in preference to a man;   if bo, what?Out of 2 39 replies, 41 are in the negative;   62 consider that women excel men in milking;   30 farmers prefer them for the rearing of stock, 9 for poultry keeping, 5 for field work, and 1 each for fruit picking and driving horses,(3) In what branch or branches would you advise any woman tospecialise or become trained, who wishes to take up farm work as her permanent livelihood?Of the 217 answers, 65 farmers advise women tfi specialise in milking, 61 in the rearing of stock, 40 in dairy worfc and 23 in poultry keepings    Four farmers advise women to specialise in shepherding^ while a smaller number advise the specialised training in thatching, horse work, hedging and ditching.These answers are interesting as showing the opinion of a group of farmers on the relative value of women&apos;s work.     It might have been expected that they would emphasise that value in regard to poultry keeping, fruit picking and field work, but it is not so and the value of women&apos;s work seems to be, in the opinion of the farmers, specially in regard to cars of stock and dairy work.In order to meet the demand for a further supply of skilled milkers and other workers, about 120 women are now in the training centre3*Satisfactory reports have been received this week of the Land Army clubs in different parts of the country, and of the good work being done by the Welfare Officers in counteracting the loneliness and absence of recreation in so many of the country places oWomen InstitutasoGood results are reported of the action taken by Women1s Institutes in Wiltshire and Hertfordshire in bringing pressure to bear upon the local authorities for improvement in drainage, ulie removal of refuse heaps and the provision of a playing field for children.Twelve new Institutes have been started during the week, making a total of l;028o

There is, however,,, some consolation in,the fact that no case has been confirmed in.Devon, Cornwall or Monmoutho     The reports of suspected cases have been 63 and have come from all over the country.   The work of the Branch and of the Inspectorate Staff has- naturally been very heavy, the clerical work only being   got through with groat difficulty and by working overtime.One of the Glamorgan outbreaks being at Bridgend, an   Order has been issued applying the Control of Djogs Order to the whole of the county.     Cn account of the outbreaks in Kent the London Middlesex area is to be extended to include a part of Kent and another Order issued that will apply to the whole of Kent.Veterinary Department.Swine fever material was examined in 87 reported outbreaks, In 62 swine&apos; fever was found to exist,-Anthrax,material as examined in 9     -reported outbreaks.

As the result of a Conference held be-tween representatives ofTEe Road Board and the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries a Joint Committee has been formed to consider the question of road tarring as it affects the inland fishermen, and to devise means to avoid risk of pollution of streams.     The Joint Committee have appointed a small Sub-Committee of four members (two representatives of each Department) who are investigating the points of more immediate Importance In connection with the tarring actually being done or contemplated during the current year and who are collecting the necessary information to enable the Committee to take forthwith such preventive steps as may be necessary and practicable, file question of experiments will be considered at a later date. &apos;Disposal of Waste explosives in the Sea.

Deputation of Herring Curera.    A Deputation representar tive of Ih^lish and&quot; Scottish&quot;nerring curers and of the fishermen was received at the Scottish Office by the President and the Secretary for Scotland.     The Deputation urged that the Government should guarantee a price for cured herrings in order to give confij.-dence to the trade, which is.at present perturbed by uncertainty as to the prospects of a market in Germany and Russia - these two countries having in the past absorbed some 85$ of the total land-in&amp;s.     The President pointed out that it was not clear to the uninformed that the arrangement proposed would benefit the fisher-men, and proposals for securing the interests of the fishermen have since been advanced by the curers&apos; representatives.Preghwater flj sh Committee.Elvers.     Some Orders have still to be completed, but the total number distributed to date is 1,404,000 or about 180,00C more than last year in spite of the increase in price.Intelligence Division.Publications Branch.&apos; The number cf applications for ordinary issues of the leaflets was 320 in response to which 1,375 copies were des-patched.In addition, 9,100 copies of the leaflets were despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution..Applications were received for 361 copies of the three Bound Volumes of leaflets, and 53 copies of the pamphlet &quot;How to Manage an Allotment&quot; were sent out,During the week 7/omen&apos;s Land Army leaflet No. 6 (Pig Keeping and Breeding) was published, the copies being forwarded to the Women&apos;s Branch for distribution.    An unnumbered leaflet (An Experiment in the Rearing of Calves on whey and iieals) and a re-print of the &quot;Notes on Manures&quot; from the April issue of the &quot; Board&apos;s Journal, were also issued, copies being forwarded to 12,000 and&quot; VtCOO persons on the respective leaflet lists.The usual number of enquiries bearing on agricultural matters was received from the public and from other sections of. the Beard, together with correspondence submitted by the attend-ants at the &quot;Corn Exchange Stands&quot;.Ho. 40 of the &quot;7/eekly Notes&quot; for Farmers was published on Thursday April 29th.Dairy Branch,Control of Milk Prices.    A very great amount of dis-? satisfaction prevails in the Country in respect of the recent order issued by the Ministry cf Pood with regard to the control of summer milk prices .The attempt of the Ministry to establish differential prices is perhaps the greatest cause of dissatisfaction.    Numerous resolutions have been received in the Branch protesting against the prices as laid down in the Order.     It seems certain that unless some action is taken to amend the order , the future effect will be a considerable diminution in the milk supply.    Already there are indications &apos;hat in certain districts farmers instead of milking their cows by hand are putting calves on t.^ them and intend to fatten off their co^s rather than bring them again into the milk-ing herd next season.
Encouragement pf cheeeemajcing.    The announcement of the milk prices without a simultaneous statement respecting the provision of a parity priee for cheese, is still haying an unfavourable effect; on the development of this seheme.    Many districts which would have i &quot;been started by now have delayed operations and the Authorities are withholding their final decision pending a definite statement as to the position of cheese prices during the coming summer.    Unless some prompt action is taken there is every likelihood that there will be a diminished supply of home produced cheese this season as compared with last.tArable Dairy Farming Demonstrations.    Several possible sites haVe been inspected and reports on them prepared, namely, Holton Heatk, lopen and South Petherton in Somerset, Tregew, Trouspen and Great Tre-hane and Trewinnow in Cornwall *    Conferences have also been held with the Board1s Smallholdings Commissioner for Somerset and Cornwall and -with Profesoor Bryner Jones in respeot of &quot;Vales;   also with Somerset Smallholdings Committee and with the Cornwall Agricultural Instruction Committee.Further enquiries have also been made respecting the Vale of Pewsey.    A Conference has also taken place with the Land Division respecting the development of Intensive Dairy Holdings in connection , with Farm Colonies.Arrangements have been made to visit the Colonies.    A Ccn-r ference has also been held with the Commercial Division respecting the preparation of plans for such homesteads as may be required in connection with the hcldinr.3.Itaotose Factory.    For some time past the Office of Torks have been asked to proceed with the erection of the Factory at Hasling-ton.    Progress has been made, but not so rapid as the Branch would wish.

It will be seen, therefore, that of the 1.000 allowances at present allotted for farm training, over one half (507) have already been taken up during the period of a little over three months that the Scheme has been in active operation.Unlessththe applications drop off, it will be necessary to consider whether Treasury authority should not be obtained for additional allowances, but as a few of the officers who start training will no doubt drop out and others will not require training for the full period of two years, the existing number of allowances could no doubt be augmented without any increase in the expenditure already authorised by the Treasury.Officers continuing in the Army (including those in the Army of Occupation) will no doubt look to the Board to ($rant them &quot;farm training allowances&quot; equally with officers already, or shortly to be, demobilised.    The Press Notice which is being issued by the Ministry cf Labour regarding the whole Government Scheme of Training for ex-officers will give the 31st December next as the time limit for making applications for training.The Wilts County Committee have cancelled a grant to one officer who had started training, but who proved entirely unsuitable. The Coim-dttee&apos;a action has been approved by the Board, and the officer has returned the portion of the grant already paid to him.29 County Committees have up to the present refused grants in 122 cases, on the following grounds:-Unsuitable for training (insufficient education etc.)   .... 30Insufficient or no capital............................... 23Not in need of Goverimient financial assistance    ........... 22Can be -Rained by near relative.......................... 9Disability toe great    ..-.......... ?....... *................ 5Already trained    ,,-........................................ 7Training desired is outside scope of    O.A.T.

Preparations are &apos; being made, for Schl-Rsbj and mangold planting of which there will be a larger acreage this ;year.The work of the farm generally is fairly well forward;.     The lost satisfactory feature in connection with the arable portion is that at -the beginning of the year there was 925 acres of foal and poor land, but at the present time nearly every field is clean, and the prospects of this next cropping season are good so far, in spite of the weather.Live Stock Branch.Live Stock Grants,No, of Grants approved for boarsdo. dO. bullsdo. do,     heavy horsesDuryng. week eniVd o lay,7 125dodomilk recording     NilMJl^-Eg c ord ing Co rt i fi c at eg and Reg1atr ati on.No. of Certificates issueddoo Cows accepted for registrationNo. of Stallions accepted forregistration46 731 Tprii Ifrttfo25 63 105 2Total since I Ocr&quot;, 1918.4,033 1,435Total j3ince 1 Hov.1018.172.254The routes of tho Board&apos;s Premium (Thoroughbred) Stallions have now been settled and the ZO stallions are now on the read.

Beef cattle were rather more in number than last year, but calves were less.    Both breeding ev/es and lambs were fewer than in April 1918, but other sheep (for mutton), about a quarter of a million more.    Figs were also more numerous than a year ago, by about a quarter of a million.     The estimates made by the Committee last November of the number of cattle and sheep likely to be available for slaughter during January - March have proved very accurate;   the actual numbers being 2,673,000 cattle and 1,583,000 sheep, while the estimates were 2,700,000 and 1,620,000, respectively.The Treasury have now sanctioned the scheme for the appointment of Inspectors to verify the statements cf farmers, as to their acreage under corn, before paying claims for the guaranteed prices of corn;   but have raised questions as to the necessity of checking every farmers return.    The apportionment of areas to each Inspector, and ether details of the scheme, are now under consideration.     With this object the number of holdings growing corn, and the acreage under corn, in each Crop Reporter^ district, must be ascertained, and a temporary staff has been engaged for this purpose.Agricultural Wages Board.A meeting of the Committee on Rates of Wages for Boys and Female Workers was held on Wednesday, 30th April.During the week 183 cases of complaint of non-payment of the minimum rates were received, the largest number from a single county being 31 in the case of Yorkshire.    Forty-one eases were sent to Inspectors for visit;   enquiries by correspondence were made in 269 cases;   and 27 cases were completed.    Reports were received from Inspectors in 19 cases.Markets Branch.Export of Livestock.   Official certificates were issued for the export of 3 horses and &quot;9 cattle to Argentina, and 9 horses to France,     20 enquiries regarding foreign import regulations were received.Farm Yorkers1 Branch.The first meeting of the Committee appointed by the President to consider and report what form of organisation woiiS be most suitable, having regard to all the circumstances, for settling by conciliation any disputes that may arise between employers and workers in agriculture, met at 3, St. james Square, on May 1st. All the members of the Committee were present.    A list of points for discussion prepared by the Secretary to the Committee was submitted, and it was agreed that Conciliation Committees should be formed for each administrative county of England and Wales.    A discussion then took place on the point whether   the Committees should deal with all cases of dispute referred to them, or only with those cases where
nowhere &quot;both parties were members of a recognised union, and it was decided &quot;by three to two that both sides to the dispute must belong to a Union,     The question then arose whether the Conciliation Committees were to be purely independent bodies, or to be regarded as set up by the Government for the purpose of settling disputes. After some discussion it was agreed that the meeting should be adjourned in order to give^members an opportunity of discussing the matter with their respective organisations.Land. Reclamation Branch.Progress of&apos;Schemes.Wash, N.W. Shore,The 14 days notice under 2M. of the Defence Of the Realm Regulations of the Board1s intention to enter upon the stretch of foreshore between Gibraltar Point and Old Leake, seawards of the existing embankment and above high water mark of ordinary tides, expired on the 2nd inst.     No objections have been received from the parties concerned.Huts. 14 huts have now been delivered on the site of the camp at Wainfleet:   two have been erected and the site for a third levelled.&apos; Pencing.   More than one half completed.Plant.   Competitive quotations have been obtained from a number of manufacturers and agents holding secondhand stocks of barrows, tip wagons, navvy picks, etc., etc.    During the week samples of these articles have been inspected at the manufacturers&apos; or merchants&apos; yard and orders have been placed for the quantities required.     In cases where inspection near London could not be arranged, orders have also been placed for sampleyitems to be delivered at V/ainfleet, the quoted prices being held firm until the samples have been either approved or rejected by the Resident Engineer.Labour.   5 more labourers have been engaged, bringing th  total number of men employed on preparatory work up to 19, all of whom ccme from Skegness and neighbourhood.    The Manager ef the Boston labour Exchange states in an official letter to the Board that all the Labour Exchanges in the District have been instructed to adhere rigidly to a rule that no workman known to be ,. usually engaged in agriculture is to be submitted for employment on the reclamation works.Though all possible preparations are being made in readiness for the execution in due course of the proposed engineering works it is not expected that the Branch will be in a position to begin the actual work of building the new sea banks for several weeks to come.The Great Northern Railway Company have been approached with a view to obtaining workmen&apos;s tickets for the men coming froia Skegness and district who are engaged in the preliminary work of erecting huts etc,Borth, Cardigan.The Chief Engineer has seen the Engineer of the Cambrian Railway in order to have an understanding on certain points as to
bill the utilisation of the Company1s embankment as a sea wall.   His report is under consideration.The Branch are still unable to obtain precise particulars of the area controlled by the Industrial Settlements Committee.     As, however, &quot;it row appears to be practically certain that the Committee does not hold an option on more than approximately 400 of the 500 acres covered by the proposed scheme, a communication has been addressed to the owner -    of the remaining 100 acres inviting him to join in the scheme on practically the same terms as he/ve been arranged with the Committee, . i.e. suggesting that he should either sell the land^ to the Board at a price based on its present rental value or undertake to pay after reclamation the difference between its present value and its reclaimed value both amounts to be fixed by a valuer, with the usual proviso as to arbitration.Secretary.7th May, 1919.
