WAR   CABINETSalaries of Scientific and Technical Officers - in the Government Service.MEMORANDUM by SIR ERIC GEDDES iThe proposal contained in GoT* 7108, by thePresident of the Board of Education, is one which I wish to support, and I think it is one of urgencye If, as appears inevitable, the State is to embark upon great practical, administrative and in&quot; dustrial schemes, it is essential - having regard to the class of experience from which we must draw and the present standard of taxation and coat of living - that the salaries to be paid to such Officers should be reviewed.I think it would be a great mistake to make this a Departmental Enquiry, and I think that the Com-mittee should be a thoroughly representative one; and the terms of reference should be drawn up with great careoI therefore beg to propose that the War Cabinet should remit the proposal to a Cabinet Committee of Ministers of the Treasury and the Departments princi-pally concerned,-with a view to making recommendations to the Cabinet as to the size of the Committee, the terms of reference, and such other matters as may be necessary in order to obtain a very early report and full considera-tion of the subject.15th May, 1919, . (Sgd.) ERIC GEDDBS-
