C GEDDES.15.V.19.
In accordance with your instructions 1 visited Nottingham, Sheffield, Leeds and Bradford, on April 4th, 5th, 7th and 8th   -respectively, and I summarise below tho main impressions which 1 have received.The two points which strike mo most forcibly are the very real urgency for the immediate return from the Forces of the youngish middle-aged men and the need for re-organisation of the system of Government in the Provinces so as to ensure close co-operation between the local officials of the various Departments.    To get the best results it appears to me essen-tial that local officials should work as a team, and not solely in the interest of their own particular Department.For example, a great deal would be gained if Education Inspectors, Ministry of labour Officials, Factory Inspectors, and Offioar$ of the Lecal Government Board would all learn to regard themselves as representatives of &quot;the Government1&apos;, to speak 7/ith one common voice, and to help ouT each other.It is interesting to observe that wherever one goes, one is met with a spirit of optimism everywhere, provided people are first asked to take a long view of the situation.    Ija fact, they all see a &quot;silver lining&quot; ahead, email though it may&apos;be.    Nevertheless, it is patent that in some industries, nofcablyrth-ose connected with house erection, a good many months may elapse before things take any shape at all.The more cne sees and hears, the more one appreciates how urgent it is to get back frfcm the Forces to civil life and into industry, the directing brains (not necessarily the close preserve of the Officer class), by which I mean as a general rule, those over the age of 28 or 30,    In certain industries which have not been touched to any large extent by the galvanising hand of the munitions demand there is a plethora of old men who are without audacity, without prescience, and without decision,     1 oould cite innumerable examples to prove how deplorable this state of affairs is, but I have taken four typical cases which I give below together with one shewing the reverse of the picture.    I might mention that the first two cases relate to two cutlery and silversmith firms cf world-wide repute.First case.    The firm (all old men), prides itself on the fact tHat they have neither a telephone nor a typewriter in their business IIn the second case, the owner, a very well known man in the Horlh&quot;,confessed&apos;&quot;to me In the course of conversation that single handed he felt unable to face the problem of recon-struction and that at the moment he was simply carrying on as best he could until a younger man, whom he has taken into partnership during the War, returned from the Army,    Be was perfectly frank about it; he stated that the whole of this famous industry was a hundred years behind the times, that he had carried on his share of it for many years now on the lines of hi3 father before him, but that at his age he found it im-possible to endeavour to meet the needs of the future, involving-ing as this probably would the removal of his works from Shef-field, a reorganisation of the industry, and all the ramifica-tions such a change would involve, details of which It is un-necessary for me to enter Into here.
ThiTdcaso,- a comparatively small but famous engin-eering tifmTrTtho Midlands.    The Managing Directors health has deteriorated to such an extent, partly owing to War effort, that he is lacking in the physical and mental power to cope with the needs of the hour.    Indecision is the result, and the firm merely exists on the reputation they have built up over a long period of years through the excellence of their wortananship.    The Board have just brought in some young, fresh, and highly efficient men from the Army who have not taken long to appreciate the weak-nesses of the situation/   They, however, are powerless to effect anything as the dead hand of age throttles any serious efforts they may make to effect obvious improvements.Fourth case.    The Kembors of a City Council in the  UdlanaT&quot;consist of practically nothing but old men ranging from 85 downwards to the youngest, the City Clerk, who is over 50 himself I    The single exception it) the case of on alderman, aged about $8, who has just returned from the Amy, and is himself busily engaged rebuilding a small but success-ful tleotricai business.    Be owned to me in confidence that it was impossible to move his colleagues to appreciate the needs of the moment, far lees the future.These four oases are typical of what X believe is going on&apos; throughout tho country.    The whole caio is admirably put by Krs. Creighton In an article entitled &quot;New T/ine in Old Bottles&quot; in the current Contemporary Review, and la confirmed by everyone with whom X have spoken.Fifth ease.    (The reverse aide of the picture).   X chanced io meet a Territorial officer, well known in the treat Hiding, who has just returned from the seat of war.    Re is a brewer by profession and he informed me that he had guaranteed every employee who wee a returned soldier from the War a minimum wage of 50/- a week,    X asked him if this was econ.-omieally possible or sound, and he replied that his absence from business during the period of the War had allowed him to , return fresh to his work and with his mind free from old time prejudices.    He realised that the effect of doing this and effecting other Improvements in similar directions would to some extent limit his own profits during the current year, but this he waa quite prepared to face, as it merely meant reducing his personal expenditure In certain directions which were no longer absolutely necessary to him.    He assured me, however, that he was optimistic enough to see his way out of all his difficulties, and he was determined to have a minimum wage of bQ/* a week throughout his works before the end of the year. He told me too that he had given every employee one week*s holiday on full pay as a thank offering for the Armletice, the advent of which could not have been more heartily welcomed than by himself IThe question one instinctively asks is &quot;Can anything be done to remedy this?11    In my humble opinion a great deal could still bo done If the military authorities could only grasp the urgency of the problem of Reconstruction and all it means if this Country is to hold its own in the future, and I am convinced that if anything is to be done much greater efforts must be made at the earliest possible moment to clear the Army of all ranks retained against their will over the age of 28.    It is between the ages of 28 and 37 that the mass of men who are really required in civil life are to be found.
Much, I venture to think, could be accomplished it more energy and width of vision were thrown into a vigorous re-cruiting campaign.    Not only should efforts be made to entice men back into the Army whose presence in civil life ia of no great importance at the moment, but men suitable for labour and auxiliary corps duties should be enlisttd on a voluntary basis on lines somewhat similar to the Royal Marino Labour Corps, thus releasing men whose presence in civil life is urgently required and whose duties in the Army are in many cases of comparatively little importance.    The views I have expressed above were confirmed again and again in the course of conversation.    I cannot help thinking that were the direct or indirect effects of the present policy of retention really appreciated the Treasury would raise no difficulty in granting many thousands of pounds for advertising purposes to obtain the necessary number of volunteers to replace those Income Tax payers and producers at present compulsorily retained in the Forces.In Yorkshire I was met on every side by demands for Governmental decentralisation.    The administration by Government Departments in the Provinces in my firm opinion is chaotic.    The Factory Inspectors offioe is In one portion of a City, the Manager of the Labour Bxohange has hie se^t in another portion, the Local Government Board1; Inspector probably hides himself in some remote village, and so on.    One finds that there is an absolute lack of co-operation between any of th*so officials, and many of them ars not known to each other, nor do they take any interest in each other doings.    Can this state of affairs be remedied?I think the immediate thing to do la to arrange that all Government Officials in the Provinces should toe housed as far as possible in the same building.    There could then be no excuse for their not meeting occasionally and consult-ing each other.    I find, too, that there ia little, if any, co-operation between the local representatives of tho Ministry of labour and the Local Government Board Provincial officials,    I cannot help thinking this is all very deplorable-able, and it all helps to give a handle to the bitter com-plaints and charges which are made against the Central Government by prominent local people.    The more I see of the administration of this country the more I realise how urgently we require far reaching changes in provincial ad-ministration,    Those sitting in London are apt to forget the fact that places like aiasgow, Leeds, and Birmingham contain large and live populations, who are very Jealous of their own rights and reputations,    In this oormeotiou I would like to add that some bitter comments were made to me too on the swollen staffs in the offices of the Central Government in London.I cannot pees over the much discussed question of Unem-joloyment Donations.    If one listened to all the wild talk, ichlofly emanating from peoplo who have never personally known what roal poverty is, one would come to the conclusion that the Government should bo arraigned and.shot at dawn for wilful extravagance!    After going Into this question with people who really know, 1 have come to the conclusion that much of this talk is frothy twaddle.    That there have been and possibly still are scandals,and serious scandals, in the way this money has been drawn may be true, but the War ended
w (J Ifsuddenly, an adequate Staff had to he hastily improvised, and it was at first found impossible to cope with every eventuality,     On the other hand, there is no question to my mind, that it is only absolute need that loads a large proportion of these people to draw this money at all.   The better class of worker dislikes doing so, and would much prefer steady employment.    One of course sees the oommer-cial acumen of our race looming forth as in the case of the two daughters of a certain doctor who were heard to say &quot;if I am entitled to the money, why should I not have it?    Every-body else has, why should not I?&quot;Enquiries go to show that the labour leaders who sit on Local Advisory Committees are just as anxious to get the people back to work as tho employers 3eeing that in propor-tion equally heavy charges are being made against their funds for unemployment as in the case of the State,Then we come to the second period of 13 weeks, a quite different situation arises,    In the Yorkshire and East Mid-lands Division the figures go to show that 50$ of the women who have drawn unemployment benefit for the first period do not reappear at all.    Of the remaining 50$ some 12-g$ to&apos;25% Only obtain any further award at allj in other words approxl-matoly one woman in six can be said to be in receipt of unem-employment donation during tho second period.I would like to utter one word of warning,    I do not think the people of this country will stand destitution among their fellow men and women, and when the second period of 13 weeks comes to an end I am convinced that some means must be found to counter any chance of this occurring for the security and well-being of the State.I must now deal with the case of the disabled soldier. I regret to say that the enquiries 1 made on this score tend to show that a very serious state of affairs may arise in connection with the employment of these men.    In Sheffield alone there are some 300 out of employment,    The Manager of the Employment Exchange warned me that employers were get-ting disheartened with the abortive result of their patriotic efforts in taking on these men.    They found them extraordin-arily difficult in innumerable ways.    Some of the disabled openly avow that it is the duty of the Government to maintain them for the rest of their lives; others have probably had thoir health undermined in some subtle way which renders their continuous employment, however hard they may try, im* possible; others by grit and fortitude- stick to their jobs in the same way that they would defend a post to the last man. The whole question is an exceedingly difficult one, and how it is to be solved, if ever It can be, is beyond comprehension. I would only however wish to mention that if it is not seriously tackled it will eventually become a problem for urgent con-sidcratlon.     Personally, I am inclined to the view that the rush and bustle of life in a Midland city ia not the most suitable for a man who has been riddled with bullets.    The more restful occupations that are to be found in seaside resorts and small country towns would appear to be more health giving and more conducive to the general improvement in well-being of tho disabled.    The question seems to be by no means entirely a medical one, nor Is it entirely confined to those whose bodies have been pierced by a bullet or shell.
I found the consensus of opinion to he that the &apos;engineering shops had by no means completed the clearing up process consequent gn the cessation of the supply of munitions.    Innumerable questions have still to be set-tied, machinery altered, fresh lines developed, and a hundred and one. other details which can hardly be appro-ciated by the layman but which all tend towards delay.I feel it would be wrong on my part te conclude without saying a word about Employment Exchange Managers. 1 have been greatly struck in the course of these visits by the breadth of knowledge and enthusiasm displayed by the Managers of the Employment Exchanges or their Deputies whom I have met.    They are all men obviously held in res-pect by the Local Authorities.    They have been seriously overworked and In my firm opinion much underpaid.    A well known man in tho !7est Riding informed me that he and many cithers thought it was iniquitous that their emoluments were not Increased.    That men holding these responsible positions should only be graded at a salary of  350 to  500 a year Is to my mind a deplorable anomaly.    If I were asked what should be the salary that a firBt class Manager in these important cities should receive I should unhesltat-ingly reply  800 a year.It is astonishing to find how much a good Manager is consulted on all kinds of questions connected with Govern-mental work however Indirectly connected with his own indi-vldual sphere.    I myself have witnessed the on more than one occasion, and I think the country would benefit if their general status were raised.    One of the troubles of over-centralisation appears to be that the emoluments of those living in the Provinces tend to be overlooked, whereas those nearer white hall are in a better position to keep their claims well in the foreground!11.4.19.
