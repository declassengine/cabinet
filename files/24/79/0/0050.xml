Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.1 havehave not seen the report of Sir James Stevenson&apos;s Committee, but 1 gather from the proceedings at the Cabinet on 8th April (to which I was not summoned) that the Cabinet, having first decided to create a Ministry of Supply, are now engaged in limiting its functions by defining the articles that it is to supply.The provisional decision astonishes me because oE the changes of opinion which seem to have occurred among those who had the privilege of being consulted on this matter. The supply of aeroplanes for the Air Ministry was undertaken by the Ministry of Munitions when I was Minister in accordance with a decision arrived at by the War Cabinet after the most exhaustive discussion, and I feel certain that nry memory serves me right when I say that it was largely on the evidence of Sir Albert Stanley, Sir James Stevenson, and Sir Arthur Duckham that this decision was taken. I certainly acted on their advice in pleading through many months for this decision. Has it worked badly ? Now that fewer aeroplanes will presumably be wanted than were wanted during the war, is the Ministry of Supply likely to be less capable of supplying them than the Ministry uf Munitions has been ?The Ministry of Munitions obtained most of its functions against the strenuous opposition of the using departments. In every case the same objections were raised to the transfer of supply, but as supply was more and more entrusted to the Ministry of Munitions, in each case (guns, ammunition, motor transport, aeroplanes), I claim that the supply was satisfactory and that the difficulties, which were wholly theoretical, about the relationship between the user and supplier were successfully overcome. The objections raised have for the most part been due to a belief that a soldier ceases to be a soldier and a sailor ceases to be a sailor it his services are at the disposal of some other office than the War Office or the Admiralty. I had, however, always regarded the supply of aeroplanes as an excellent example of the way in which united work between two offices can be secured, and of the way in which all the preconceived objections to supply by a Ministry of Supply can be overcome.I was constantly advised when I Avas Minister of Munitions, and in particular by one who has been conspicuously concerned in the recent decision, that if he were asked to put his finger on the greatest obstacle to the equipment of our fighting forces during the war, he would say unhesitatingly: &quot; The competition between departments for the available labour and the resources of available manufacturing concerns.&quot; It always seemed to me, as it seemed, I know, to the Haldane Committee, that a Ministry of Supply should embrace more and not less than the Ministry of Munitions. Indeed, the basic arguments for a Ministry of Supply, as stated in the Report of the Haldane Committee, are : (a) To eliminate competition between Departments for labour, materials, and the services of individual firms;(h) To ensure that the prices paid and the conditions imposed under Government con-tracts for various classes of work should so far as possible be arranged upon uniform lines;(c) To secure economies in the use of technical staffs (such as contracting, accounting, costing, and inspecting sections).(I would commend the whole of Chapter VII. of the Haldane Report, which was drafted after much discussion, as worthy of the attention of the Cabinet.)Now every supply which is taken or excluded from the Ministry of Supply detracts from these advantages which I have quoted above, and if every department is to supply itself, I see no reason for a Ministry of Supply at all.Everybody with whom I have discussed the matter has always agreed that the Admiralty would present groat difficulties owing to the notorious prejudices of that Office and their whole attitude towards the Ministry of Munitions during the war. But it was always hoped that this attitude would be modified as time went by and that we could at least start the Ministry of Supply with the same functions as the Ministry of Munitions had during the war. It was in this belief that I addressed the Cabinet on the 21st October of last year. I have ceased to have any direct responsibility for these matters, but I remain, despite a change of office, of the same opinion as I formed when Minister of Munitions. I am hopeful that the result of Lord Crewe&apos;s enquiry into the India Office will be the transference of our Stores Department to the Ministry of Supply and 1 have advocated this change to the Committee.E. S. M.12th May 1919.ss94  45  5/19
