^^fe^PBNT AND THE GO VERMONT OF THE AUSTRALIAN COUiOMEALTPI m. $&amp;the DEVELOPMENT OF OIL IK PAPUA.&apos;When this scheme was first before the Cabinet, i expressed my opposition to it.     In the present position of the National Debt and with the heavy capital demands which already confront the Government both for domestic purposes and for development in Colonies and Protectorates, I could not contemplate with equanimity a proposal that for the first time in our history we should embark on expenditure for the development of enterprise within the territory administered by a Self-Government Dominion.consideration, whether in view of. the strong desire of the Commonwealth Government for this co-operation and of the importanOe of developing Imperial oil resources His Majesty&apos;s Government should not participate on the understanding that a business-like scheme could be framed for the exploitation of the oilfield if it were proved successful and for adequate participation in the profits by His Majesty^ Government.understand, been attempted.
