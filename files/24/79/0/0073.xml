ACTION TAKEN. /&apos;    ^The Estimates of the Ministry of Eood for the financial year 1919-20 were -^submitted to the House of Commons, in Committee on Supply, on Tuesday, May Gth.In his speech the Food Controller summarised the work done by the Ministry of&apos;! Food under the three heads of Distribution, Supplies and Prices.   Under the head oJh Distribution, he alluded to the success attained by the system of rationing established by the Department.   Before the rationing system came into being over 1,300,000 c persons were found in queues every week; this figure had been reduced to 20,000 after rationing had been in being a fortnight.   Among the original and effective features of the rationing system he mentioned the single ration book covering all commodities ; the arrangement for the registration of customers with retailers, and the resulting possibility of the absolute guarantee of supplies to the consumer; and also the money value of the meat coupon, the only means of securing absolutely fair distribution.On the question of supplies, Mr. Roberts stated that on the trading of the year 1917-18 a gross profit of 1,549,0001. was made on a total turn-over of over 67,000,0001., the net profit being 133,0001. or about \ of 1 per cent, on the total turn-over. These figures are exclusive of the work of the Royal Commissions on the Wheat and Sugar Supply.As regards prices, during the first three years&apos; of the war the cost of the principal foodstuffs in this country rose on the average at the rate of 3 per cent, per month. The development of food control from July 1917 checked this rate very considerably, and from that date until the Armistice, the average monthly increase was less than I of 1 per cent, on the 1914 prices. Since the Armistice, and up to April last, there has been a decrease at the rate of 4 per cent, per month.Instances of comparative prices in other countries were given, e.g., in October, 1918, the price of the 4 lb. loaf in this country was 9d. ; in France,1 lOJcZ.; in Germany, ll^d. ; in Sweden, ll^d. ; in the United States, Is. b\d. ; and in Austria, Is. \Q$d. These, except in the case of the United States and of Austria, are prices affected by a bread subsidy. The price of beef on the same date was Is. b\d. per lb. in the United Kingdom ; Is. 9d. in the United States ; 2s. lid. in France ; 2s. 2d, - in. Germany; 3s. 2d. in Sweden ; and 5s. Id. in Austria. Butter in the United Kingdom was sold at 2s. bd. per lb.; as against 2s. Sd. in the United States, 4s. Id. in France, 5s. bd. in Germany, and 10s. in Austria.After referring to the summer milk prices recently fixed, Mr. Roberts turned...to the steps taken and proposed for the demobilisation of the Ministry of Food.   The      il total staff of the Ministry has been reduced by 40 per cent, since the Armistice, and **it is expected that the Department wili come to an end in the middle of November or early in December. . There were, however, certain functions of the Ministry which; in his opinion, ought to be continued, in particular the provision of information concerning prices, and, if necessary, the regulation of prices, a certain measure - of milk control, national kitchens, and the question of the control of trusts and combines, &amp;c. The question as to the Department or Departments which should be responsible for these functions was before the Cabinet, but in the opinion of the.Food Controller the Ministry of Food was a temporary war Department, and should come to an end not later than December 31st, 1919.Mr. Clynes, who followed, paid a tribute to the work accomplished by the Ministry of Food; and, speaking from the point of view of the consumer, pressed that the Department should be continued, as had been represented to the Cabinet by the Executive of the Labour Party, the Central Board of the Co-operative Union, and the Consumers&apos; Council.(33)8068   Pk 16   150  5/19   E &amp; SA
During the rest of the debate, attention was mainly concentrated upon the summer milk prices. Members representing the South-Western Counties maintained that differential rates for the producer should not have been fixed, and that the South-Western Counties should receive the same rate as had been fixed in the rest of the country. It was also represented that the Lancashire producers should receive the additional rate fixed for the industrial area of the West Riding of Yoikshire.Mr. McCurdy, who wound up the debate, promised that careful consideration would be given to these representations by the Travelling Commission, on whose recommendation the prices had been, fixed, and by the Ministry of Food, and that deputations and evidence from the areas affected would be received.Food Council. Meetings of .the Council were held on May 1st, 6th, 8th and 13th.On May 1st the Council approved a detailed memorandum to the War Cabinet on the arrangements to be made for the demobilisation of the Ministry of Food, which &quot; was forwarded to the Cabinet the same day. It was subsequently reported that the Cabinet had agreed in principle to the arrangements proposed, and had referred the question of the transfer to other Government departments of certain of the functions of the Ministry which should continue to he exercised, to the Committee on Home Affairs for consideration.The question of the retail price of bacon was twice discussed, serious complaints having been made to the Ministry by retailers of their inability to sell at the present prices except, at a loss. It was agreed that for the present the maximum retail price of 2s. 4d. per lb. must be retained, but that the Ministry should resume complete control if the present difficulty of obtaining supplies continued.In view of the fact that, as a result of the relaxation of control, it will not be necessary for the Ministry to make further purchases of foodstuffs, with the possible exception of bacon, hams and lard, in the United States and Canada, it was decided that the organisation of the Ministry in. New York (other than the Accountants Depart-ment) and of the Canadian Dairy Produce Commission should be disbanded. It was agreed that a letter should be sent to both bodies expressing the Food Controllers appreciation of the extremely valuable work which they had performed.The report of the Travelling Commission on meetings with deputations from the South-Western Counties and Lancashire on the subject of differential summer milk prices was considered. It was agreed that there were no adequate grounds for departing from the scale of prices already fixed, and that the reduction of \d. per gallon in respect of milk not cooled and delivered twice daily should be maintained. It was also decided to obtain the recommendations of the Travelling Commission in regard to milk prices for the coming winter.A Committee was appointed to consider the question of the removal of maximum prices for oils and&apos;fats, both as regards the raw materials and the finished products, such as margarine and compound lard.At the last meeting of the Council, Mr. Roberts reported that he had been informed by Sir William Sutherland that the Prime Minister had expressed anxiety as to the prospective price of food in this country, particularly during next winter, in view of possible purchases by Germany and Austria from the United States and resulting competition. In these circumstances he desired that the arrangements proposed for de-control and demobilisation of the Ministry should not be carried out without further consideration. It was agreed that Mr. Roberts should confer on the subject with Mr. Bonar Law who, it was understood, had been in touch with the Prime Minister on the whole position.Imports Board. The question of providing shipping for the importation of bacon, hams and lard from America has received special consideration, in view of the recent decrease in stocks, and it has been decided (a) that the Wheat Commission should release 25,000 tons of space during the present month, and (6) that the Ministry of Shipping should be asked to provide 60,000 tons of space for the shipment of these commodities during June and 70,000 tons during July.The amount of butter allotted to the United Kingdom by the United States Food Administration has been reduced from 1,200 tons, for which credit had been obtained, to 500 tons, and it has been decided to request H.M. Treasury to sanction the use of the balance of this credit for the purchase of butter in the open market in America. It has also been decided that, subject to a satisfactory arrangement as to price, supplies of butter should be obtained from Denmark and Holland.
Consumers&apos; Council. The Coimcil met on May 14th.The genera], question of decontrol and demobilisation of the Ministry of Food was again considered. The Divisional Food Commissioners who attended the morning session were generally of the opinion that, apart from any question of permanent control, some of the steps already taken in the direction of removing control of supplies, distribution and prices were premature. It was suggested by the Commissioners that it might have been more satisfactory if the general scheme of food control had been continued for a year or more after the Armistice, or until the condition of the world&apos;s markets had become settled. .The Coimcil also discussed the question of the control of world supplies of food and passed a resolution calling for the maintenance of co-ordinated international action.Supplies and Distribution.Meat. Supplies of home-killed meat have increased since May 1st, and, as the the price paid to the farmers is higher during May and June.than at any other time,, it is anticipated that the live stock markets will continue to be well filled during the next few weeks.The price of imported meat was reduced by 2d. a lb. on May 5th.Butter.-The weekly ration of butter was raised, as from 4th May, from 1 oz. to 2 ozs., and increased distributions of Government butter have been made to meet this alteration. The stocks in hand, are just over 20,000 tons.&apos; The restrictions on the purchase and sale of British-made butter have been, considerably relaxed by the revocation of the British-Made Butter (Restriction) Order, 1918, and dealers are now free to buy and sell without permits.Potatoes, Arrangements have been made for the purchase by Germany of 43,000 tons of potatoes,-in addition to the 100,000 tons which have already been shipped. The price of this further consignment is 81. 8s. per ton c.i.f. Hamburg less 5 per cent, discount.It has been ascertained that the surplus of potatoes in Ireland is below the earlier estimates, and that the Ministry of Food will not be called upon to meet claims for compensation from Irish growers.Tea. The first sale of tea by public auction was held on May 5th, when prices were 2d. per lb. above the flat rate at which tea had been sold under the balloting system. It is anticipated however that prices will fall again shortly when larger quantities are put on the market.Cocoa. The Raw Cocoa (Prices) Order, 1918, was susp*ended as from May 5th, and the first public sale of raw cocoa will be held within the next few days.Reports from Divisional Food Commissioners. A number of complaints are made of the excessive retail prices cliarged for fish. In certain rural districts there has been some irregularity in the supply of margarine. The arrangement for fixing retail milk prices have given rise to no local- difficulties outside the South-Western Counties and Lancashire, where the general question of the wholesale prices for the areas has led to some uncertainty as to the position.The general success of the scheme for providing sugar to be used in domestic jam-making appears to be assured. &apos;Orders Under Defence of the Realm Regulations.The Foreign Holdings (Returns) Order, 1918, and the Horseflesh Maximum Prices Order, 1918, have been revoked as from May 12th, and the Canned Salmon (Returns) Order, 1918, and the Sugar (Confectionery) Order, 1917, as from May 13th.An Order dated 2nd May 1919, amending the Meat (Maximum Prices) Order, 1917, alters the Schedule of Maximum Wholesale Meat Prices as from 5th May 1919.An Order dated 9th May 1919, amending the Beer (Prices and Description) * Order, 1919, gives to consumers of beer in a saloon bar protection similar to that already given in the public bar, and the licence holder will now be compelled, on demand, to supply beer by measure in the saloon bar at the price in the schedule applicable to such beer in the saloon bar.Enforcement of Orders.The total number of prosecutions during the fortnight ended - May 3rd was 1,094, of which 963 were successful.
PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Imports.Weekly imports of the principal foods and feeding stuffs rose steadily during April from 119,600 tons to 205,800 tons, making an average of 158,900 tons. This improvement was substantially maintained in the two weeks ended 10th May, for which total arrivals averaged 194,900 tons. The chief improvements on the April figures occurred in the case of cereals, which showed an increase from 75,300 tons to 102,900 tons, and in that of meat, where the quantities for the two weeks were 60 per cent, above the April level. Bacon (11,400 tons) and sugar (42,100 tons) only just failed to maintain the high level of the preceding month. Of the less bulky commodities, butter and cheese, each 2,800 tons, were considerably above the average for this year, and tea, coffee and cocoa continued to arrive in very large quantities, but the rate of lard arrivals (900 tons), while it marked an improvement on that of April, was still less than half current requirements of the imported article.Stocks.The decline in the stocks of cereals in the United Kingdom between 1st April and 1st May, viz., 258,000 tons on wheat, and 697,000 tons on other cereals, was considerably greater than occurred between the same dates a year before, when stocks of wheat actually rose slightly, and the decline in other cereals was only about one-third of that recorded above. On the other hand, actual stocks of wheat on 1st May of this year were no less than they were a year before, and. stocks of other cereals were 150,000 tons up. Stocks of wheat represent about 10-^ weeks&apos; supply, or.about 60 per cent, of our requirements for the remainder of the cereal year. Of the total stocks of wheat and flour within the country on 1st May, inclusive of stocks still on farms, one-third was returned as held by the Ministry.Of the stocks of meat and provisions in cold stores and importers warehouses on 1st April and 1st May, stocks of refrigerated meat showed a decrease of 18,100 tons, which agrees with the decrease shown in stocks held by the Ministry, leaving total stocks on 1st May at 51,900 tons or If weeks&apos; total requirements of butcher&apos;s meat. Stocks of bacon held in cold stores and importers warehouses and by the principal wholesalers on 1st May, were about the level of those a year before. Owing to delays in unloading and transport, recent arrivals of dairy produce are not fully reflected in cold stores and warehouse stocks, and the position may be better indicated by stocks held by the Ministry, which include quantities in port and in transit within the country. The latter show on 1st May 19,500 tons of butter, an increase of 6,300 tons on a month before, and 7,600 tons of cheese, or a corresponding increase of 1,600 tons. With the very small arrivals in April, stocks of lard continued to fall heavily, though those on 1st May (16,300 tons) were still about four times the quantity held a year before.Heavy imports of sugar brought the stocks of this commodity (317,000 tons) to a point above that reached on the same date in any year since 1914. Stocks of tea, coffee and cocoa continue very high, those of coffee representing considerably over a year&apos;s supply, while those of cocoa fell little short of the same measure., : A return of stocks of jam, jelly and marmalade held by manufacturers on 31st March gave as total stocks, inclusive of pulp reckoned at its equivalent in the finished commodity, 12,400 tons of jam and jelly, and 33,800 tons of marmalade. On the 28th February, the corresponding figures were 16,000 tons of jam and jelly, and 15,400 tons of marmalade. The output in March was 10,400 tons of jam and jelly, and 30,600 tons of marmalade. The resulting total consumption rate for March was approximately 5,900 tons per week, at which rate stocks on 31st March represented about eight weeks&apos; supply.Consumption.Butchers&apos; Meat. During the period of the rising scale of prices, attention has been drawn to the withholding of supplies of live stock by farmers in the second half of the month to obtain the higher prices coming into operation at the beginning of the following month. With the approach of the maximum point in the scale, on May 1st, the fluctuation of home-grown supplies in Great Britain was even more marked in April than in previous months.   From an estimated total of 19,500 tons
in the week ended 12th April, they fell to an average of 11,200 tons in the two weeks ended 3rd May. Issues of imported meat failed to make up the balance. Although complaints as to the quality of some of the frozen meat were not wanting, it cannot be said that the small supplies of imported meat merely measured a restricted demand, as in previous months, for difficulties of distribution, aggravated by holiday conditions, were responsible for local shortages. For the four weeks ended 3rd May, estimated weekly consumption of home and imported meat was 24,400 tons, as compared with 17,200 tons a year before.; Flour. --Weekly quantities of flour delivered from mills or released from imported stocks in the four weeks ended 26th April (87,100 tons) were the lowest recorded in recent years. When, however, account is taken of the high rate of issues in the first two months of this year, it is found, as was to be expected, that the total for the year to date is above that of the corresponding period a year ago, namely, to the extent of 4 per cent. Partly owing to difficulties in the supply of home-grown grain to mills recently, the proportion of flour milled in the United Kingdom to the total issues of flour fell from 86 per cent, in the preceding four weeks to 77 per cent, for the four weeks ended 26th April, at which latter proportion it also stood a year before.Fish. The following table further illustrates the recovery of the fishing industry from war conditions : Fish Supplies in April. 	April 1919.	March 1919.

The figures illustrating distribution of supplies show that owing probably to difficulties of transport, the principal inland markets got a smaller proportion of the increased supplies.Prices.Retail prices on 1st May, as recorded by the Department of Labour Statistics, show a further fall as compared with July 1914; the weighted average, which showed an increase of 113 per cent, on 1st April, showed an increase of 107 per cent, on 1st May. The significant changes were an increase of margarine from 9cZ. to 9f&amp; per lb., following upon the increase in the price of raw materials, and a further seasonal increase of 3&apos;6 per cent, in the price of potatoes, against which are to be set decreases of 28 per cent, in milk, 6&apos;6 per cent, in fish, and 1 &quot;8 per cent, in eggs.Wholesale prices on 10th May, showed generally little variation on those ruling during April. British wheat and barley showed a continued hardening tendency, but the net change, 3d. to 4cZ. per quarter, was small. The effect of the abolition of flat rates for home and imported meat appeared in a reduction of imported beef from 116s. Sd. to 108s. 6d. per cwt., and of imported mutton from 123s. 8d. to 115s. bd. per cwt. With the removal of control over prices of oils, the latter rose very sharply; this is reflected in the price of linseed which reached 830s. per ton on the 10th May,-as against 597s. Qd. for April, while cotton seed advanced much more slowly from 297s. 6d. to 300s. per ton.A  8068 a3
