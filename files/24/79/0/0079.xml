Shis pocwsbt is thb wtbbty Of his brueahhio majesty&apos;s govsiimgship) .s b o r a t* 297q.t,7279. war    q a 3 i h fj.output Off qua3 ETC, ?OR 1919*80* Memorandum by tho Chanoellor of the S&amp;ohequer.At tho dato of the Armistice the Ministry of Munitions appear to have had on ordor for tho Array 2,GOO of the now 18 pounder gun with the same numbor of carriages and meonanisms, reoouperators 1,500 end limboro 1,950.A month after tho Armistice, the Treasury wrote to the War Office pointing out that, the continuanoo of manufacture of Munitions of war such as ^uns, shells, etc, being&apos; from the point of view of Army supply unnecessary in view of the elisting acoumu-lations, any new requirement end the continuance of orders already placed in expectation of the continuance of the W-r must roquire Treasury sanction pending approval by tho Treasury of the Army and Munitions estimates for 1919-20.A copy of the letter was sent to the Ministry of Munitions, requesting Treasury sanction for expenditure on new or old con-tracts except in cases in which manufacture ia temporarily continued on Labour Grounds under contracts already placed or as pgrt of cancellation arrangements authorised by the liquid-dators.*The War Office replied that they had already &quot;notified tho Ministry of Munitions that generally speaking&apos; domands for Munitions of all kinds for the Army should be regarded as cancelled with certain exceptions, principally nsvv designs of heavy snd field artillery already in course of manufacture with certain natures of ammunition.&quot;Since that date the subject has been examined in detail by the Officers of the two departments with the goneral result that work  is now continuing only in accordance with the reouira-ments of the Ministry of Munitions from the point o? view of Labour policy, and such labour as that Department finds it necessary to rotain for the present is being employed on orders    f which represent the best value from the military point of view and those which have progressed so for that it would be waste-     $ ful not to complete them.&quot;Treasury sent a copy of this letter to the Ministry and asxed for their roply at early convenience.The Ministry replied on 8th January stating that the Minister would continue to assume responsibility for carrying out the duties (i.e. the  -urchase or supply of munitions) always tfearing in mind Their lordships wish that new orders involving a fresh charge of any importance on the Vote of Credit should be submitted to Them lor conourrenoo in f-dvanco. As regards tho financial year 1919-20 the Minister would supply the &apos;r&apos;sr Office with ell tho information necessary for them to f:.amo estimates of their requirements.It was assumed by the Treasury from thi3 correspondence and i;i view of the definite statement by the War Office in their letter of the  1st December, that any guns continuing to be sun-pi iod war ** be^ng supplied T*n considerations r T^bour&quot;&quot;policy.     Thj Army Estimates for/
1919-20 have not yet been received in the Treasury for examination but in the Ministry of Munitions Ustinvte it is observed that under the item &quot;guns and carriages&quot; there appear the following figures as commitments on -ar contracts:-Further enquiry shows that these contracts -&quot;ere not continued upon l:\bonr grounds.   Vhat actually is taking place is the re-arma-ment of the artillery with 18 pounder guns.On this I   rould point out (l)     the present time, at tho conclusion of an exhausting war, is about the ncrst that could be selected for incurring expendi-ture amounting to several millions on re-armament of the forces;(2)     the scale of re-arm,jment must of course depend upon the future strength of the -army, a subject which has not yet bo en deter-mined by the &apos;&apos;;ar Cabinet.     Apparently n,500 guns would be sufficient for 70 Divisions and possibly more&quot;&quot;if a 4 gun battery basis were reverted to, but from this there may have to be deducted something on account of reserves.    Provision is, therefore, apparently being m-d* for another   rar on the scale of the last;(3)   the Ministry of Munitions stste in their letter addressed to tho &apos;&quot;.ar Office that no financial economy would result from the termination of the arrangements for supply of gun equipments having regard to(a) contracts claims for breach of agreement, and(b) unemployment benefit for labour discharged.1,300 of the 2,500 guns are being sup lied by the Royal Ordnaneo&apos; Factories or the National Ordnance Factories, be-ides a considerable part of the carriages and mechanisms etc. which are on order from the Ordnance Factories.    Contract claims could not arise on the Government, ^ork and i,he argument about saving unemployment donation is regularly used, no-- in support of departmental extravagances,    If we listen to them we should h ve to continue all kinds of unproductiv expenditure indefinitely for fear that there might be an interval of unemployment before productive expenditure is resumed.I must therefore press for a reconsideration of tho artillery position with a view to effecting all possible economies on guns and ammunition.   The Ministry of Munitions indicate the possibility of saving  371,404 on contracts fo   empty shells and components If con-tracts ire now reducer or cancelled.   The amount of shells and shell contract;&quot;.&apos;) being continued on the basis of.sup-&apos;ly technically required is apparently -ver  1,300,000 and I am strongly of opinion that tho shell situation should also be reviewed with a view to making such reductions of cost as are possible.Trade     .. ?
