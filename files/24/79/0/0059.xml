This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic r &apos; s;y&apos;s Government.A/ By Lord Milner1   QIESIMSiOF AUSTPALIAN LE&amp;D AMD COPPERI understand that the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia has approached Mr,Lloyd George in Paris with reference to tho purchase of the export-able surplus of Australian lead and copper during a short periodoNegotiations have been proceeding between Lord Inverforth and Sir Auckland Gaddes and the representa-tives of the Australian producers, and schemes have now been put forward involving as regards lead, the guaran-tee of a minimum price for 18 months for a fixed por-tion of the Australian output, with provision for division of proceeds above a certain average price per ton, and for the withholding of the large Govern-ment stocks from the market unless and until a somewhat higher price level is reached;  and as regards copper the purchase of a definite amount at a minimum price for twelve months, with provisions as to the division of any profits.I need not enter into&apos; the details of the schemes which will be embodied in a separate memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade but I wish to urge upon the War Cabinet the&quot;desirability, from the political point of view, of effecting some arrangement which will meet the wishes of the Commonwealth Government.The position as regards lead is that during the war, in response to repeated requests of His4 ajesty&apos;a Government to increase her output and shipments, Australia, reduced her consignments to the East thus surrendering a trade built up at considerable cost, and sold to the Ministry of Munitions at prices-which
which, though the same as those given for lead pro-duced or refined in England, were nevertheless lower than those paid by the Ministry for various parcels of American lead,As regards cogger the Australian production is comparatively small, hut it       of great service during the war;   the Commonwealth Government in the course of the war arranged for the increase of the refining capacity of Australia to deal with all the &quot;blister copper produced there-    Australia possessesthe largest electrolytic refinery within the Empire, a valuable Imperial assets in the Empire production of copper is at present sadly insufficient for its needs, and.it would, in my opinion, be a serious mistake of policy to treat the Australian copper producers in any way which might tend to discourage development work.Mo15 C S O 4
