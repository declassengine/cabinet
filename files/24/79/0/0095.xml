h?HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC HAJ35STY&apos; S GOVERKICTT.SECRET,: TO CABINET.SUPPLY OF BEER.gote by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.,   I am gravely concerned as tb the position in regard to the supply of Beer.     Lord D&apos;Abernon telephoned to me on the 19th instant that in his opinion it was urgently necessary to increase the barrelage allowed by the last Cabinet decision . He has forwarded to me a report by Mr,Madden, General Manager of the Board&apos;e Direct Control Area at Ehfield, who$ he states has a wide experience of the licensed tradl and is&quot; well quali-fled to speak with authority on the question of the present shortage of Beer-    &apos; \This officer reports that the shortage appears to be greater than ever and has been most noticeabie-during the last fortnight.     He does itdS think that this is due to under-brewing or the withholding of supplies.    The plain fact is, he states, that the demand exceeds the $limply.     This he attributes partly to the hot weather, partly to the increase .  in the number of beer drinkers owing to the progress of demobilisation and partly to the effect of fixing a maximum price for the higher gravity Beer in consequence of which a given sum of money notf pays for an increased number of pints of such Beers,Mr.Hadden reports that in order to ascertain the position as to closed feUblio houses he visited a South-eastern area on Sunday,, the l8tn instant, between 1 and 2 p.ra.    He ,gives details of his route from Waterloo Station to New Cross Gate via the Waterloo ftoad, Elephant and Castle^ New Kent Road, and Old Kent Road, frorfi: the New Cross Gate to, the Elephant and Castle via Peckham, CaitfBerwell, and Walworth ftodd, and he summarises the results sis follows 1-public houses, 100 closed 47open 53 * in twelve of which no beer of any description was on sale.     There was no beer on sale at the refreshment rooms at Waterloo Station.    The houses that were open were packed with people.     In those in which no Beer was 0 sale the people were, drinking Spirits.    Amongst the closed houses were the Elephant.and Castle and the Rockingham, two of the largest public houses in London.     He adds that there was no disorder and no signs of drunkenness,such a scarcity of Ueer is in the opinion of both the Food Controller and myself a source of grave and legitimate discontent and public danger.     In my opinion it threatens the maintenance of even a reasonable control.    \7e both proposed to the Cabinet an increase to\ 24,000,000 barrels instead of 20,000,000,     The Cabinet rejected our proposal, but we are held responsible for the discontent and other injurious consequences which ensue.   - I doubt whether 24,000,000 barrels ?;ould now be sufficient and I request that the Cabinet will, reconsider their decision,I have asked Lord D1Abernon ib send the Cabinet a further report from the Board of Control with Such recommenda* tions as the Board may wish to make.TREASURY,S.W.21st Hay, 1919.(initialled)   A.
