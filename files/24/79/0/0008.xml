At a Meeting of the 1rfar Cabinet held on December 4th, 1918 this recomendation was approved.2.On February ,13th 1919, the Committee informed the Air Ministry of this decision, and of the steps being taken to provide alternative accommodation, and a communication was sent by the Ministry to the war Cabinet Committee on Accommodation on March 10th 1919, stating that the Ministry was in process of re-organisation, and that it was impossible for the allocation of the new premises and the removal thereto to be settled until the main lines of the new organisation were approved.    Accordingly, they could not contemplate removal from the Hotel Cecil before the end of April, a delay of ,two months being thus involved.3. In order to secure the vacation of the Hotel Cecil,the War Cabinet Committee on Accommodation has authorised a scheme for the transfer of the headquarters of the Air Ministry from the Hotel Cecil to Empire, Tndia and Canada Houses in Kingsway, which Involves the removal of the Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement and two sections of the Home Mechanical Transport Department of the War Office which are now in occupation of the latter buildings..4. It la intended that the Commission Internationale deRavitaillement shall be accommodated for the greater part in buildings on the opposite side of Kingsway occupied by the Aircraft Production Department and the transfer has already been partially effected, but progress is being retarded by the request of the Air Ministry that further reallocation of the accommodation of the Aircraft Production Department and Aeronautical Inspection Department shall remain in abeyance pending the decision of the r&apos;ar Cabinet regarding the absorption of these Departments by the Air Ministry, .   This request also affects the rehousing of the Home Mechanical Transport staff In Clements Inn.5. One of the buildings, West Africa House, has alreadybeen cleared and is vacant and unless it should be immediately reoccupied, considerable hostile criticism will undoubtedly arise, particularly on the part of the Kingsway Tenants.6. I, therefore, submit that the settlement by the WarCabinet of the question of the absorption by the Air Ministry of the Aircraft Production and Aeronautical Inspection Depart-ments, should not delay the rearrangement of accommodation necessary for ensuring the vacation of the Hotel Cecil at the earliest moment and that my Committee may be authorised to proceed with the arrangements upon the lines which they have already approved..   &quot;&quot; (Sd) Alfred Mond.H.&apos;rt,Office of &apos;-orks.
