m Document Is the Property of I is Britannic Major*ty&apos;s Government.1      5\ SECRET DIRECTORATE   OF   intelligence report No. 2, (IgB&amp; P^MlSootlsnd House, S.W.1,7th May, 1919.REPORT .ON REVOLUTIONARY ORGANISATIONS IN IKS UNITED KINGDOM(Circulated by the Home Secretary)The reports this week have again been favourable.    The revolutionary organisations have been working hard to make their Labour Day anniversary a success, and that it should have passed off so calmly shows that there is no active dis-eontent among working men as a whole.    As mentioned in last week1s report, the intellectualists, having overdone their eulogium of the Russian Soviets, are at present very reticent, and the smaller fry, having very little initiative of their own, do not know what line to take up new t&apos;n.xr* their usual stock-in-trade - exaggeration and distortion of the utterances of their leaders - has failed them.The most serious matter this week is the report that soldiers enlisted under tho Derby Scheme intend to demobilise themselves on May 11th.on the ground that they were engaged for the War and six months after.     The promoters of this movement are hoping that the Government will resort to force, and so precipitate a revolution.May day v/as observed in many countries, but in no country was it oelebrated more quietly than in England.     The chief Hay-day Labour demonstrations were in Glasgow, Coventry, Sheffield, Nottingham, Leicester, Leeds, Paisley, Kilmarnook and London.    Only in London was any disturbance attempted, and this was nothing more serious than an attempt by Miss Sylvia Pankhurst, whose funds are low, and who never neglects an opportunity for self-advertisement that may bring in subscriptions, to enter the House of Commons;   she was charged for obstructing the Police, but was discharged at Bow Street next day.    The Resolutions passed at the demonstrations were very similar and the following account from my correspondent in Glasgow, which was probably/
probably the largest demonstration, is typical of the others&quot;Tho Kay Day demonstration in Glasgow was claimed by several of the   speakers to be   the biggest on record. It is difficult to estimate such a crowd, but several of the speakers said there   were at least 100,000 men, women and children present, but I think it is safer to say there wore not moie than 50,000.     The demonstrators, who represented Labour, Socialists, Co-opyratiVtJ am Sinn 3?ein Societies, assembled   in George Square and marched to Glasgow Green v/ith about 50 lorry and brake loads of childrenv mostly from the Socialist Sunday Schools. Speeches worn delivered on the Green from 22 platforms. The chief   opojJ-.br was Countess Markievicr,.     She spoke from a lorry dye orated with Sinn ))&apos;ein flags, and she called   upon tho workers in Sco-eland to join the Irish People in their struggle for   freedom.Hell McLean,   M.P. spoke from one of the Co-operative platforms.     He said that the Coalition Government had broken all its   pledges-and that the Co-operatives, with thoir strength of three and a half millions, ought to be able   to compel Parliament to act on their behalf.    Most of.the other speakers denounced the Capitalist system, and the Goverr-meut for sending troops to Russia.At 4 p.m.   a   bugle sounded and simultaneously thefollowing resolution was moved from all the platforms :-&quot;That this meeting declares for the overthrow of &quot;the Capitalist System of production for profit, and &quot;the establishment of  a   Co-operativ&amp; Commonwealth &quot;based on production for use; and further, that this &quot;meeting of workers assembled on Glasgow Green send &quot;their fraternal greetings to the Jtaxopean Soviet &quot;Republic and Workers of tho Y/orld.    Also, we &quot;protest against the arrest and deportation of foreign &quot;subjects without trial;   further, we urge the with-&quot;drawal of  all Armies of  Occupation, and declare &quot;in favour of   the 1st day in May being observed as, &quot;International Labour Day&quot;.A/
A further  Resolution was also moved and passed :-&quot;That this great gathering   of Co-operatives, &quot;representing Glasgow and West of Scotland, strongly &quot;protests against the   application of Excess Profits &quot;Tax to savings of Co-operative Societies, which is &quot;an unjust imposition upon Organisations of &quot;Consumers who mutually share the benefits of &quot;Collective Trading.    We further condemn the proposal &quot;to tax Co-operative Trading in any form which does &quot;not apply to all citizens equally, and as a means of &quot;defence, determine to so organise the Co-operative &quot;Vote, and to work along with other progressive &quot;working class forces, for Parliamentary a*ad Local Government Bodies, and thus secure the nectary &quot;representation to promote and defend the interests &quot;of the Co-operative movement&quot;.At St. Andrew^ Rill in the evening, Neil McLean, said that they intended to obtain the release of Gallacher, Shinwell and all the others who are in prison in connection with the 40 hour strike.May Day Demonstrations at Leicester passed off quietly. The resolutions were much the same as at the meetings elsewhere.    A call was made to join the Trade Union and Oo-operative movement.    In most parts of the country the Co-operative movement is not popular with the Socialists who think the Co-operators only want their 5$.Leed3 May Day was celebrated on Sunday May 4th.    My correspondent reports he has never seen a body of men so well dressed,   well fed,   and in so good health and temper as followed in this procession, which numbered about 5,000. There were about 25,000 prosent at the rendez-vous but when the speeches began the crowd began to melt away, for many had been attracted by the bands of which there were six.    The speeches were not   revolutionary in tone and only about 2tjfo wore red favours.THE BEER GRIEVANCE.The Liverpool Dockers complain they cannot work continuously for eight hours on their heavy jobs without some beer,   and that the break between 5 and 6 preventsthem/
them getting a drink before starting for the &quot;first half-night&quot; (6 to 10 p,m.) and when they hare finished work at 10 p,m.    The men say, &quot;Ue put up with the &quot;beer restrictions during the war, hut we donH intend to much longer&quot;.    With regard to the &quot;Ho Treating&quot; order, they argue that the people who made it can afford to treat their pals publicly or privately to dinner and wine,   without any restrictions to upset them.It is not the Dockers only who are dissatisfied, but workmen and business rat*n generally.    The workers in and around Birmingham are also dissatisfied and attribute the shortage to prohibitionist propaganda.u&amp;smplqymsmt.In Birmingham the Workers Committee and the Workers International Industrial Union here formed joint Unemployed Committee, which has pronounced agaiast all over-time.    Our correspondent reports that local labour is cuietly organising and is determined to take united action on the unemployment problem.    Nothing violent is anticipated whilst the unemployment benefit continues,   as workers do not wish to jeopardise the benefit by demonstrations.    Generally speaking, there is more unemployment amongst the unskilled   than the skilled workers.WORKERS1 SOCIALIST ^KDLl^TIQH.Speaking at a meeting of   this federation at 400, Old Ford Road, (Miss Paiikhiirst1 s offices)- to an audience of only twenty,   Miss Zinjzh. arid R.H. Bellitt made violent speeches. Miss Smyth said she would welcome a &quot;Revolution, &quot;a bloody one if needs be&quot;, to o/ercome capitalism and restore liberty of speech and   action to workers.    Pollitt was   certain that a revolution/
Revolution would oome and   oared not whether it was peaceful or bloody, but he hoped it would   not   como until the masses were proporly educated.    Considering the amount of blood the workers had shed in this war for   the capitalists, what did it matter if the capitalists lost some,    Pollltt also addressed a meeting at the Dock Gates on May 4th, where 200 were present and called upon the dockers not to load any ships going to Russia with guns and  ammunition, which were being sent out to murder their own class,Pollitfs speeches have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions who does not, however, consider him worthy of powder and shot.THE INDUSTRIAL WORKERS Off THE WORLD.The Communist faction in America is drawing up a new programme in favour of    war-like tactics like   those in Holland, Russia and Germany.     &quot;Solidarity&quot;, the official organ of  the Industrial Workers of  the World, has been suppressed.     Members of  this body in England are too short of   funds to launch any new periodical, though they intend to issue a pamphlet entitled &quot;A Case for Communism&quot; by Guy Aldred, Editor of &quot;The Spur&quot;, who has lately been liberated from prison.    Aldred was advertised tc speak from the Anarchist Platform at the Glasgow May-Day Celebration,DEPORTATION Off RUSSIANS ON MAY   2nd.Eighty-two Russians were deported   to Odessa by the S.S,   &quot;Orotava&quot;,    All of these were known to have Bolshevik sympathies and were otherwise undesirable.    The Deportations have had a marked effect upon the Russian Jews in the East End of London, and the fear of Deportation seems to have put an end to revolutionary propaganda among them.
MOBILISED SAILORS&apos; &amp; SOLDIERS&apos; F^DjSRAT ION -At present, the leaders of this Federation are level-headed men, and from Liverpool it is reported that they areagitating on peaceful lines.     They are, however, disturbed because the girls who threw the white feathers about in 1914are holding on to their jobs with the connivance of the Govern-ment and the omoloyers.   In Nottingham, there is a good deal offeiflamed talk.   On April 27th, there was a mooting at which the speakers declared that justice had not been done to the men andtheir dependants, and there would be no remedy unless the men,by strong combination, forced the hands of the authorities.The discontent in this distriat appears to be spreading,andthere is certairly a danger that if the leaders ever becomefirebrands the Federation may be a serious menace to the publicpeace.There is a coffee-shop rumour among British soldiers ina&apos;Paris that the 11th May is fixed for a demonstration for man flfoc enlisted voluntarily or under tho Derby Scheme.   They contend that they were engaged for the duration of the war and six months after, and ae the war coased on the 11th November, their term of service expires on May 11th,   According to information received, the &amp; tators are advising all men who enlisted in this way to take off their buttons, shoulder straps and badges and declare that they have automatically become civilians.   Confirmation of this report has now come in from a British source.   Steps are being taken by the Military Authority, and enquiries txe proceeding. THE NO-CONSCRIPTION FELLOWSHIPMiss Joan Beauchamp, publisher of the &quot;Tribunal&quot;, states in her paper that for the last twelve months it has been printed at a secret address, and not at the address fciven in the imprint.   The &quot;Tribunal&quot;, formerly a weekly paper, now appears fortnightly.   Miss Beauchamp&apos;s appeal against her conviction is still pending.There/
There was a joint meeting of the Independent labour Party, tho British Socialist Party and the No-Conscription fellowship in Liverpool on April 30th; about 1,500, among whom were a largo number of soldiers, attended.     Colonel Wedgwood,   M.P. said that though he had supported con-scription in the past, the necessity for   it had gone, and the   Army would   now  be used to break strikes and to discipline the youth of   the country, so that they would , not &quot;answer back the   fore-man&quot;, and to break the Russian Bevolution.     Among the speakers were the notorious K.C. Wellhead and ox-Lieut.   Birch, Secretary to the North Manchester Branch of  the Discharged and Demobilised Sailors&apos; &amp; Soldiers.    A second resolution in favour of  releasing consciontious objoctors   was not carried unanimously.JOHN MoLEAH.John  McLean has been making a tour of South Wales addressing audiences of from 150 to 1,000.    Among the many reckless statements he made was one that at Glasgow he has advised the   people to seiae the Post Offioe, banks, municipal buildings, prison and   police stations, stores, foodstuffs and shipping, and if   the farmers refuse to bring in their produce to seize it and burn their buildings. Nevertheless, at his largest meeting, a resolution demanding the withdrawal of   tho proceedings against the Glasgow rioters was supported only by about 150 of  the audience. It was resolved   at one of  the meetings to reprint &quot;The Miners&apos; Next Step&quot;, with a slight alteration to bring it up to date.McLean&apos;s speech at Tonyrefail is now before the Directo: of Public &apos;&quot;;rosecutions.  . -Something may. shortly have to be done about this man, though.it seem to be recognised by sober working men that he is insane, and that his speechesare/
m    q   mere quite irresponsible.In South Wales, a   ponny has been found on which the words &quot;Puppet King&quot; have   been stamped across the head of the Sovereign.    Tho lettors appear to he,re been made with separate steel dies, and the defacement has probably been done by an engineer.POLICE DEMONSTRATION IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE.A very large crowd of Police and spectators attended tho meeting In Trafalgar Sciuare on Sunday the 4th.    Most of the speeches denounced the Commissioner for militarism and called for   his resignation.    One speaker, Constable Zollner of  the City Police - a   man of  German origin - said that we were refusing recognition of  the Police Union when such a Union was recognised by the German Government before the War. Enquiries have been made and,   as far as can be ascertained, this is not the   case:   in the territory occupied by the Allies there is no recognised Union even now.The speakers talked darkly of &quot;drastic action&quot;, but it i, highly improbable that tho Union would be able to call a strike, for tho support it is receiving in the Metropolitan area appears to be on the wane.    It is significant that the new Secretary,   Hayos, who has been making great efforts to repair the damage done to the Union by his predecessor Marston,   said in an interview the other day that they had the   support of  the working classes -       of the population and   that the remaining Z5)o did not  matter.POPULARITY 07.....THE   PRINCE Off WALES.My Leeds   correspondent tells me that the Prince of Wales is very popular with the better class workers, who seem to hope that he may become   a racohorse owner.    In private conversation, they speak of  him as a &quot;sport&quot; and a &quot;proper gent&quot;.
IKDBPEITDSlff LABOUR PARTYThe Independent Labour Party held  a   demonstration at Merthyr on the 27th April,      James Vinstone said he hoped the people would   become wiser and would build up the labour Party in the House of  Commons.    As for the Coal Commission, some of the culprits were to be   called to the bar but matters would not   end there and other industries must be brought to the judgment bar.    Noah Ablett said he was a Bolshevik,   which he explained meant a &quot;Scientific Trade Unionist&quot;.    Bolshevism was Socialism with its working clothes on.    George liansbury said there was nothing more infamous in our history than our treatment of Russia end the other revolutionary countries.    They were looking forward to building a ICoir Hardie Memorial Hall in which to hold their meetings. , &apos;B.H.T.
