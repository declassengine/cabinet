PHIS DO CIO. T IS THE PROPERTY OF .11 IS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;secret.UAR CABINET.i.T. 7270.CENSORSHIP. OF -CABLES AND.TIRELESS. (Ref oronoe&quot;war cKbinot&quot; 56&quot;*6, Iiinutd 2).-Note by -Sir Auckland GcddcsAt a Hoc ting held on Tuesday last, the 13th. instant, I uas desired by the Tar Cabinet to inquire into the present working of the Censorship, report the result to the Cabinet at an early date and make recommendations as to the policy His   .-,.)..1esty&apos;e &quot;Government should adopt.Accordingly this morning I arranged to meet the respective Heads of the postal and cable censorship ;*t the I   &apos; ar Office and went with them into the whole question.     I enquired into the working of both systems, and discussed the possible advantages of maintaining the Censorship as compared with the manifest disadvantages, and I hope to have an I   opportunity of reporting the result of my inquiries at an ;   early Meeting of the Cabinet,     Briefly, my conclusion is I  this, if the Government consider that special services are I   essential, the Postal raid Telegraph Censorship must be main-I   taihed, but the.consequent damage to British trade, while it I  cannot be estimated in actual figures, must be enormous. 1  If, on the other hand, it be decided that special services are not essential, I see no reason why both Postal and Cable 1  Censorship&apos;should not be abolished forthwith, to the 1  immeasurable benefit of our trade..(Initialled) - A.C.G.
