fa DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT AMI C MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERKMBHT) .E C R E T.* &apos; WAR CABINET.,T. 7239. :WOM1 S.. EMAFCIPATI OH BILL .(Note Toy the Chancellor of the Exchequer.)I circulate herewith to the War Cabinet a memorandum on the subject of the Women1s Emancipation Bill which recently passed the second Reading and was referred to a standing Committee, together with a memorandum which I have received from the Lord Chancellor on the same subject,   This Bill raises such grave issues - unforeseen, I think,, and certainly unpro-vided for by the promoters * that I suggest that the Bill and these papers be at once referred to the Home&apos; Affairs Committee.(Initialled)   A.C.I  8th May, 1919
KcDorandum by tho ^ivil Service Commissioners and the Treasury on the Bill&apos; to remove certain Restraints and&quot;&quot;&quot; Disabilities imposed upon women (to be cited as the Women&apos;8 Bmancipation Act).(Cppy of the Bill Attached)The above named Bill, which has passed the oecond Reading and is believed to be coming on immediately in Com-mittee, requires the most serious attention of His MajestyTs Government so far as it affects the Civil service.The first clause is widely comprehensive.     It ^pears to admit no exceptions.   Mo woman is to be disqualified (a) by sex (b) by marriage for any post v/hioh comes within the extensive scope, of its terms.There is no doubt of its affect so far as marriage is ooncerned. , The general rule of the Civil Service is that a woman who holds any established post therein must vacate her situation on marriage, and another general rule grants her on certain conditions a gratuity on marriage,     a very large proportion of women Civil servants do marry and quit the Service.     The of feet of the Bill if it becomes law will be to allow all the many thousands of lost Office female empleyees and, all the other female Civil Servants to marry and retain their positions.^oroen Civil servants If married either must deliberately endeavour to remain childless or will be foroed to neglseot either their children or their duties to the Service or both.     Either neglect, it is submitted, is contrary to publio policy.    The social effects will obviously be un-desirable.     The physical effects of service during ^re^ancy must also be considered, ^nd the interruptions of wor$*;&apos;before and after confinement must be important&apos;,     The opinion of the Post Office as a very large employer of women
I L dwomen should be sought as to the effects on the public service, before the Bill is allowed to pass in its present form.Amendment by omission of the vo rds &quot;or marriage&quot; is tempting..    Such an amendment would however appear to preclude the appointment of married women e.g. as Justices of the Peace, but that might be got over by some consequential amend-roent, or by rules made by the Lord Chancellor.as regards sex, it will be remembered that the normal method of recruitment of the Civil service is bj means of competitive examination conducted by the Civil Service Commiss-ioners and the great majority of Civil servants enter the service in this manner.    As a general rule the regulations under -which the examinations are held do not, oxcept in the case of posts definitely assigned to Women (women clerkships, typists, matrons etc., etc., ) make reference to the sex of the candidates but the regulations are based and drafted on the assumption that the candidates for situations not advertised as situations for vomen will be of the male sex and the inten-tion is cle...rly indicated in such matters as the age limits, subjects of examination etc.as regards disqualifications by&apos; sex we are advised that &quot;in the event of the Clause becoming law and on the Regulations as they now.stand the Civil Service Commissioners would not be bound to admit a female candidate for, say, Clerkships Class I&quot; the intention that Clerks Class I shall be men being clear, under the general principles by which such Regulations snouldbe oonfcti?ued.This may be, and no doubt ie, good law.    But great odium would fall on any administrative authority vvhxcn attempt-ed to frustrate the apparent meaning and intention of ttf*^ Billeither by.interpreting the existing regulations or by framinginew Regulations explicitly confining Class I or any similar Class in the Civil tiervice to men.     In so far as/ country
to tho Civil service is by open Competition it would no doubt be plausibly-&apos;and forcibly -urged at -any; rate hy-partisan? that -fco-exclude women from any competition for posts which they were not prima facie unfit to fill would be to disqualify -them, within the meaning of tho Clause.   If it is desired that any class of posts should be thrown open t* women the decision should be taken by direct enactment or order and not by a com-prehensive clause which iovers all manner ef posts, some of which are certain!^ not suitable to women.Instancescf such posts might be multiplied, but one example of the highest importance may be quoted.   From the Competition for the Indian Civil Service women could only be excluded by a construction fcr amendment of the Regulations which would be regarded by feminists as arbitary and unlaw-ful; and it is at least very doubtful whether the India Office and the civil service Commissioners could maintain such exclusion.   But no one who has any knowledge of Indian Feeling could consider it possible at the present time or in the near future to Bend out.women to govern India.   The opinion of the India office should be sought before the Clause is- accepted without seriCue amendment. .     : :       -&apos; The question of equal pay for equal work as between men and women is under the consideration of a Committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Justice Atkin which has not yet reported To admit women to competition for any class in the Civil Service also.open to men would be to prejudge not only the principle but the application of the principle.   The Gladstone Committee do not consider it proved as yet that women in general could do work e.g, in class I equal in value to that of men. &apos;This doubt would be much greater in the case of married women, at any rate such as were not deliberately sterile. Yet the effect of this Clause, not perhaps-in law but in fact, would probably be to-force the Civil Service Commissioners to admit women to the competition for Class I; and once admitted
they could not receive leas than the ordinary emoluments of the Class, even theft gh -they might &quot;be married and mothers of large families.It is understood that Dr. Addison will press for the omission of the second Clause of the Bill.   The Lord Chancellor is understood to see grave constitutional objections to Clause 3, which in any case affects the privileges of the House of Lords and can hardly pass without their willing consent.Clause I is the nucleus and embodies the principle of the Bill.   It is submitted that so important a principle should not be made the subject of legal enactment without any provision for reasonable exception and limitation and without close and exhaustive examination of the many classes of posts which may be affected thereby.   Still less should the legal enactment be couched in language which will certainly receive a popular interpretation much more extensive and sweeping than the Courts might be prepared to enforce.   It is sub-mitted that the Clause should not be accepted without drastic amendment and sufficient safeguards.This is a question which concerns the whole Civil Service.   The Treasury and the Civil Service Commissioners concur in the views here, expressed; the India Office and the Post Office have a close and.vital interest in the terms of the Clause; but all other Departments employing women or likely to employ women are also concerned and the views of the most important should be ascertained before the Clause becomes law in its present shape.
Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor. WOMEN *&apos;s EMANCIPATION BILL. ..&quot;The interest of the Lord Chancellor in this Bill is. limited to Clauses land 3.   This memorandum,, therefore makes no observations upon Clause 2 which, as it is understood, Dr. Addison proposes to oppose in Committee.Clause 1.   This Clause would throw open to women all the judicial offices (from Lord Chancellor downwards) which are in the gift of the Crown v of the Lord Chancellor.   A Bill is now passing through Parliament enabling women to he called to the Bar and to be admitted as solicitors, and. the Lord Chancellor, speaking upon the Bill in the House of Lords, has expressed his sympathy with the proposals of the measure.   Many years must elapse however after the Bill becomes lav;, before vomen can become qualified for appointment to any judicial office, and when they have fulfilled the technical requirements necessary for qualification, it would still remain a matter of discretion to the appointing authority as to whether in any particular case a woman should be appointed to a par-ticular office.   It appears to the Lord Chancellor that it may safely be left to the discretion of the appointing au-thority to appoint a man or a voman to any such office on vacancy.A more practical result of the Clause if passed would be that it would enable the Lord Chancellor to place tomen upon the Commission of the Peace.   The Lord Chancellor is of opinion that, having regard to the pro-visions of the Representation of the People Act and to the general trend if recent legislation, it is no1 impossible to argue in favour of retaining the Statutory or Common Law impediments to placing a woman upon the Commission. Indeed he inclines to the view that in certain circumstancesadvantage
advantage if.*ould be obtained from the . presence of women upon the Bench.The Lord Chancellor, therefore, is cf opinion that so far as Clause 1 affects his.Jurisdiction, it should be allowed to become law and indeed thai positive advantage might be obtained from its enactment.On tke subsidiary point vh ether the Clause, as drafted, carries out the intention of the franers with regard to Justices of the Peace, it appears that it would be effectual for the purpose intended so far as Common Law impediments to the appointment of women are concerned, but it seems doubtful whether it iculd be effectual to remove certain direct Statutory disqualifications.The Municipal Corporations Act, 1882 (45 and 4 6 Viet. c.50.3.155), the Local Government Act,;1888 (51 and 52&apos; Viet, c. 42.8.25) and the Local Government Act, 1894 (56 and 57 Viet, o.73.8.22) make the Mayor of a Borough, the Chairman of a County Council and the Chairman of a District Council ex-:fficio Justices during their years of office, and In the case *   of Mayors in the succeeding year.-   Under the first        of these Statutes, vomen &quot;ere not eligible for membership&apos; of the Council of a Borough or County, though under the  hird they.&quot;ere eli-gible for membership of a District Council.   The Qualification of Women (County and Borough Councils) Act, 1907 (7 Ed,VII o, 33, a, 1.(1) rendered 7 omen eligible for election up or. a Town Council or a County Council, but provided expressly that if elected as Chairmen of any such body,  nmen should not virtute officM  be&apos; Justices.   The County and Borough (Qualifications) Act, 1914 (4 &amp; 5 Geo. V.c.21.s.l. (1) ) vhile extending in seme respects the possibility of electing -omen as members of these bodies, repeated this proviso.   The Local Government Act 1894 expressly limited ex-officio membership of the Bench, in the case of Chairmen., to people :ho   ere not -omen.-It appears desirable, having regard to the expressnature
&quot;nature of these provisions iif^mlif j&apos;lhtf ^owro  rvn-*exy-cfficio nombership of the1. Bench, that they should he- r^pealM: -if it is intended that election as.Kayor or Chairman should carry the same ri^ht to he upon the Commission as in the case of men.Clause^.   The .marginal note of this Clause is &quot;^omen may sit and vote.. in and for the House of Lords.&quot; The operative words of. the&quot;.Clause, however, appear to have been drawn without reference to- circumstances as they exist. There are at&quot;-present twenty ladies possessing peerages in their own right.     Fine of these peerages are barnnies by Writ and eleven are dignities by Letters Patent.    Some baronies by Whit held at present by a man may at any moment fall to a- woman, and the number of peeresses in their own right hold-ing baronies by Writ may, therefore, at any moment be increased-.     On the other hand, any barony by Writ held by a woman may at any time pass to a man.     So&apos;far as peerages by Letters Patent are concerned, however, all of them, except that of Lucas, must upon the demise of the present holder inevitably pass to, and he held by, males, or become extinct.   - The Clause, as drawn, may be effective upon baronies by Writ.     It would appear that the disqualification which prevents a woman holding a barony by ^rit from sitting in the House of Lords is a Common Law disqualification, and It may therefore be that an enactment that a; woman shall not be disqualified by sex from sitting and voting, if a peeress in her own ri^ht, would have the effect of seating in the House, -of Lords the nine ladies referred to,   The ease of the eleven dignities by Letters Patent is different.&apos; The Letters Patent in all&apos;these cases-have conferred upon a named man in usual form a-barony or.ether-dignity with a right to a &quot;Seat place and voice&quot; in the House of Lords (or in one or two casesupon
- 8 ,- 1 2f tlupon a named woman without a &quot;seat, plnce and voice&quot;), with remainder to a women without the use of the words granting a &quot;seat, place and voico&quot;, With remainder again to her heirs male lawfully begotten and to be begotten with a &quot;scatplace and voice&quot;.   The disqualification in these eane$; therefore, flows not from the Common Law doctrine which prevents women from sitting in the House of Lords, but from the fact that the King&apos;s: grant of a &quot;seat, place.and voice&quot; is limited to. the male members of the family end has- never been-con-ferred upon the fonele members, even though those female members or Borne particular named femfalo imember may at some time o&apos;r ether hold the bnrony or other dignity.Of the eleven dignities by Letters Patent at present h&apos;ld by women, nine arv descendible only tc heirs mole. In &quot;all th-s&quot; -cases- of peerages by Letters Petent hold at one time or another by women, it will be found on examination of the Patents that the only woman in whom- the peerage can ever vest is th   particular woman selected and named in the Letters Patent, descent from her being to heirs male; But in the case of the barony.of Lucas, which is an early barony by Letters, in default of male issue the peerage descends to the heirs of the body of the original grantee and it may, therefore, at any time come to be held by a woman, , -It is, therefore, obvious that in the case of the baronies by Letters patent, which create peeresses in their own right, the grant contemplated that a woman.should never sit in the House of:Lords and the woman is not disqualified by reason of her sex but in the position of a pereon to whom the grant of a seat, place and voice has never been made. It would be grotesque if when the Einrr had by Letters Patent granted to a woman the peculiar privilege of possessing a barony in her own right and trnnsmittim&apos; it to her heirsmale
male, this fact should be made a pretext to seating Her in the House of Lords.   The peerage in question has in all cases been conferred by reasons of the public services or merits of the original male grantee or of the relationship of some meritorious male person to an original female granteeIt is,   of course, as a matter of policy, otherwise with reference to the future.   If as a matter of policy it should be.thought right that the King should be empowered to summon women to the House of Lords, that would be a clear and intelligible principle and could be carried out by the form of the Letters Patent after due deliberation by His Majesty acting upon the advice of his Ministers, but n^ such principle can be alleged in defence of the proposal that a grant to a women for one purpose, namely, the transmission of the blood of a particular meritorious person, should be now turned into a grunt to her of a seat and voice in the House of   Lords without the King&apos;s leave.Generally speaking on the question and apart from tills semi-technical question relating to the present female holders of peerages, the Lord Chancellor is of opinion that no argument has been adduced in favour of the grant of peerages to women carrying with them a seat and vote in the House of Lords.     The whole question of the constitution of the House of Lords may form the subject of consideration in the immediate future.     It appears undesirable to compli-cate the consideration of that question by making at this stage so important a constitutional change as is suggested.
