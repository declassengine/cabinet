UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE POR AGRICULTURE.^ue stions for answer- on Thursday, 16th may.Mr. Thomas Williams, - To ask the Minister of Lahour,  if he is now in a position to state when he will introduce legislation to include agricultural workers within the unemployment insurance scheme^    and whether the scheme will propose benefits higher than those suggested by the Unemployment Statutory Committee.Mr.  Oswald Lewis, - To ask the Minister of Labour, whether any decision has yet been reached as to the insurance of agricultural workers against unemployment.Captain Heilgers, - To ask the Minister of Labour, whether he is now in a position to make a statement in regard to unemployment insurance for agricultural workers.Suggested answer the Government have given careful consideration to the Report of the Unemployment  Insurance Statutory Committee and have decided to accept the principle of unemployment insurance for agriculture, hut without necessarily committing themselves to the level of contributions and benefit proposed in the Report.      The details of the subject cannot properly be dealt with in isolation from the revision of the arrangements under the Unemployment Assistance Scheme, which, as the House is aware, will have an important bearing on the position of unemployed workers in agriculture after the Second Appointed Day.In the meantime it is not possible for me to give a date for the introduction of legislation on the subject of unemployment insurance for agriculture.
