?his document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET . - Copy No.CABINET.b.p. s7 (35) -AMENDMENT OP PETROLEUM (CONSOLIDATION) ACT,   1928. Memorandum by the Home Secretary.Under the Petroleum (Consolidation) Act, 1928,  petroleum spirit  (petrol) may not be kept without a licence.      Such licences are normally granted by local authorities;    but where the local authority refuses to grant a licence the applicant may appeal to the Secretary of State who may then,  if he thinks fit, himself grant the licence.The question has arisen whether a licence granted either by a local authority or by the Secretary of State can, in the event of a change of occupancy of the premises, be transferred from one person to another.      Change of ownership is a frequent occurrence,  and until recently the practice of the Secretary of State has been in such cases to transfer the licence to the new   . occupier,  and so far as is known this is also the general practiceof local authorities.-I referred the matter to the Law Officers of the Crown, who have expressed the opinion that,  in the absence of any express authorisation of transfer in the Act,  there is no power to transfer a licence during its currency from the holder to another person.It would appear therefore  (a) that the many transfers of licences already effected both by the Secretary of State and by local authorities have had no legal force,  and (b)  that for the future,  until the lav/ is altered, all applications for such transfers will have to be met by the grant of a new licence. The effect of (b), in the case of licences granted by the Secretary of State, will be that whenever a change of occupancy occurs the matter must go back to the local authority who,  in view
2 6th April,1935 .of their original refusal, may well be unwilling to grant the new licence,  in which event the whole procedure of appeal to the Secretary of Stete will have to be gone through afresh.It is clear that,  unless something is done, a position of considerable confusion is likely to arise, and in these circumstances,  I consider it essential to introduce immediately a brief amending Bill to remedy the defect.      If the Bill is strictly confined, as I contemplate it should be,  to the single point of the transfer of licences,  it will be essentially uncontroversial and ought not to arouse any discussion.      It is possible that suggestions may be made to include in the Bill amendment of the Act on other points;    but while there are in fact certain other important amendments to be considered some time, they present no special urgency and must be left to general amending legislation at. a later date.      The Bill must clearly not be encumbered with any other matter which might prejudice its chance of a rapid passage.I shall be glad to have the authority of my colleagues to submit a draft Bill,  as proposed above,   to the Home Affairs Committee .J.G.  -

Sir John Simon would be glad if this draft can be circulated to the Committee of Imperial Defence.I am, &amp;c.C. W. BAXTER.Enclosure.Draft Air Convention(on the assumption that the Convention is to be signed and ratified simultaneously with the other instruments forming the &quot; general settlement &quot;).[List of Heads of States.]Having this day concluded [reference to the other instruments forming the &quot; general settlement &quot;],Recognising that the use which might be made of modern developments in the air might lead to sudden aggression by one country upon another,Desiring to contribute to the restoration of confidence and the prospects of peace among nations by taking steps with the object of ensuring among themselves additional security against unprovoked aggression in the form of sudden attacks from the air,Anxious, in particular, to safeguard the civil populations of their countries against the danger of indiscriminate attacks from the air, which they recognise to be contrary to the Law of Nations,Recalling the guarantees already given among themselves by the Treaty of Locarno,Have resolved to conclude a treaty with this object and have appointed as their plenipotentiaries :[11325]
Who, having communicated their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed as follows:- .   1 - -Article 1.In the event of one of the High Contracting Parties being the object of unprovoked aggression upon his territory by the air forces of another High Con-tracting Party, the other High Contracting Parties will, subject to the provisions of Article 3, immediately* come to the assistance of the Party which has been the object of such unprovoked aggression with all the air forces available for the purpose.For the purpose of this Article the territories of the High Contracting Parties are respectively Germany, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the territories on the Continent of Europe of Belgium, France and Italy.Article 2.It is understood that the provisions of Article 1 will not be applicable if the High Contracting Party who is the object of attack has resorted to war against another State, whether a party to the present Treaty or not, in violation of his treaty obligations.Article 3.The provisions of the present Treaty shall not impose any obligation upon either the United Kingdom or Italy in a case to which the obligations of that Power under Article 4 of the Treaty of Locarno would not be applicable. In particular, neither the United Kingdom nor Italy shall be under any obligation, in virtue of the present Treaty, to come to the assistance of the other.(N.B. The wording of this Article must depend on whether Italy is to receive a guarantee from anybody. As the text stands, she gets a guarantee from all the Parties except the United Kingdom. It may also be necessary to provide for the position of Belgium in this Article.)Article 4.The provisions of the present Treaty are not in substitution for or qualifica-tion of any existing guarantees given by the High Contracting Parties among themselves, particularly under the Treaty of Locarno.Article 5.The present Treaty, which is designed to ensure the maintenance of peace, and is in conformity with the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Pact of Paris, shall not be interpreted as restricting the duty of the League to take what-ever action may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of the world.(Article 7 of Locarno, with the addition of a reference to the Pact of Paris.)Article 6.The present Treaty shall be registered at the League of Nations in accordance with the Covenant of the League. It shall remain in force until the Council, acting on a request of one or other of the High Contracting Parties notified to the other signatory Powers three months in advance, and voting at least by a two-thirds majority, decides that the League of Nations ensures sufficient protection to the High Contracting Parties; the Treaty shall cease to have effect on the expiration of a period of one year from such decision.(Identical with Article 8 of Locarno.)* Note by Service Departments. The Chiefs of Staff in Committee of Imperial Defence Paper 1161-B pointed out that the Treaty of Locarno contained a saving clause which placed the responsibility for the final decision to enter the war on each country concerned. By wording such as &quot; as soon as the said Power has been able to satisfy itself that this violation constitutes -an unprovoked act of aggression &quot; this point could be met.
-  -        . &apos; Article 7. -&apos; &apos;/The present&apos; Treaty shall be ratified and the ratifications shall be deposited at as soon as possible. It shall come into force -on the date on which [the Other instruments forming the &quot; general settlement &quot;] come into force for all the High Contracting Parties.[This wording may require modification if all the High Contracting Parties .are not parties to all the &quot; other instruments.&quot;]Done at
