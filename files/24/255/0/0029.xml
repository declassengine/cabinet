THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1935.SECRET. Copy No. 47P,&amp;.a (35) 2.CABINET.COMMITTEE   ON  THE  PROPOSED  AERIAL   CONVENTION.Draft Treaty of Mutual Guarantee against Air Attack.REPORT.THE Cabinet on the 8th May, 1935,* agreed that the tentative draft, prepared in the Foreign Office, of a Treatv of Mutual Guarantee against Air Attack (CP. 88 (35)), which had been discussed at. the 269th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence and referred by them to the Cabinet, together with a Note prepared by the Air Ministry, should be considered in the first instance by a Cabinet Committee comprising .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Air, andThe First Lord of the Admiralty,who should examine the various points raised in these Papers, or which might be raised by the Defence Departments, and make a Report to the Cabinet.2. We examined the draft Air Convention and comments thereon by the Defence Departments at a meeting held on the 17th May, 1935, and our observations are as follows : Preamble.3. We draw attention to two points in the Preamble as at present drafted ; (i) It contains a reference to the assumption that the Convention will form part of a &quot; general settlement.&quot; (This is referred to again in Article 7.)(ii) Reference is made to the anxiety to safeguard the civil populations against indiscriminate air attack which is recognised as being contrary to the Law of Nations.4. As regards (i) above, it will be recalled that it was the original intention of the Government that an aerial convention should form part of a &quot; general settlement.&quot; It is recognised that insistence on such a &quot; general settlement &quot; may make it extremely difficult to obtain, a satisfactory aerial convention, and a suggestion has, in fact, come from Italy that if agreement could not be reached on the other points, we should be prepared to accept the air convention alone -provided it was a good one. We are, however, of the opinion that the Air Pact should at least be accompanied by an agreement on the limitation of air armaments.  If there was no such latter agreement, one could envisage a situation[11647]* Cabinet 26(35), Conclusion 7.B
where one Party, in possession of overwhelming air forces as compared with other Parties, would see little deterrent in the Air Pact to any potential aggressive actions it might contemplate.5. His Majesty&apos;s Government have already communicated with both France and Italy enquiring whether they would not favour proceeding with negotiations of the air pact forthwith accompanied by agreed limitation of respective air strengths (telegram to Paris No. Ill of the 7th May), and Signor Mussolini appears to be favourable to this procedure (Rome telegram No. 312). In view of the inconclusive character of the reply from France a further telegram (No. 91 of the 24th May to Geneva) has been sent pressing this view on M. Laval. We have suggested to Sir William Malkin that at the jurists&apos; meeting at Geneva the draft which he would produce would omit the introductory words which treat the topic of an air pact as necessarily bound up with the achievement of all the other elements of a general settlement. This would of course not prevent the effort being continued to get the other elements agreed at the same time.6. As regards (ii) above, we consider it most desirable that some such reference as drafted in the Preamble should be made to the anxiety to safeguard civil populations against indiscriminate air attack. The omission of such a reference would be tantamount to accepting without any protest the certainty of this form of attack becoming a normal part of warfare. It would, of course, be preferable to draft an article defining clearly the legitimate targets for air attack, but a watertight article of this nature would be difficult to construct and might well cause a breakdown in agreement as a whole regarding an aerial convention.7. We therefore suggest that it is sufficient to place on record an expression which illustrates our desire to prohibit indiscriminate attacks from the air; an expression which, as it stands, we feel could not be objected to by any Party. In this we would appear to be at one with the Head of the German Government who has declared that he would like to see any air agreement which was arrived at being used as an opportunity for repudiating attack on civil populations.Article 1.- 8. It has been suggested that the words &quot; deliberate and &quot; should be inserted before &quot;unprovoked aggression &quot; in line 2 of this Article. We are of the opinion that there is no objection to introducing these words, though we are inclined to the view that their addition would not make much difference to the interpretation of the Article and that, in making any such suggestion to the other Parties, we should not insist on this point.9. It has been suggested that specific provision should be made for a saving clause in this Article which would place the responsibility for the final decision to enter the war on each country concerned. This was supported by the Chiefs of Staff in their Report contained in C.I.D. Paper No. 1161-B, where they proposed some such wording as &quot;As soon as the said Power had been able to satisfy itself that this violation constitutes an unprovoked act of aggression &apos;&apos;; such an expression would be contained in line 4 of the draft Article 1 after the words &quot;of Article 3.&quot;10. We do not differ from the opinion of the Chiefs of Staff that the responsibility for the final decision to enter war must rest on each country concerned, but we are reluctant to recommend the specific inclusion of such .a saving clause for the following two reasons : (a) Article 1 as already drafted appears to cover this requirement in that, by the inclusion of the word &quot;unprovoked&quot; before &quot;aggression,&quot; decision still rests with each Party as to whether the aggression which has occurred is unprovoked or not.Consequently, it appears to us that the Parties must, of necessity, first decide on the aggression, and it was only if it Was unprovoked that they were bound to come to the assistance of the Party attacked.(&amp;) We fear that if any such saving clause were inserted in Article 1, it would detract from its present crispness and deprive it of its value in
many eyes. It might well be interpreted as an attempt to provide us with a loophole for escape from actual co-operation if and when the moment arose,11. Under the text of Article 1 as it at present stands, air attack upon the Fleet or Mercantile Marine of one of the High Contracting Parties while outside its own territorial waters, or upon aircraft while flying over the high seas, would not constitute aggression within the meaning of the Article, and it has been suggested that the words &quot;or in or over European waters &quot; should be inserted after &quot;territory&quot; in line 2 of Article 1. There is, however, the difficulty of defining &quot; European waters,&quot; and in any case this would broaden the scope of the Pact, the original intention of which was to deal with the possibilities of a &quot; bolt from the blue &quot; in the form of sudden air attack on the nerve centres of a particular country. Nevertheless, it can be foreseen that a sudden attack directed against our Main Fleet, for example, might have as serious repercussions as an attack in another direction, and we suggest that it is for Cabinet decision whether this Convention should cover cases of unprovoked aggression outside territorial waters.12. Should the Cabinet so decide, there are two alternative forms which the additions could take. In the first, it is suggested that the following should be added at the end of the first paragraph of Article 1 : &apos;&quot; The same shall apply in the event of unprovoked aggression in European waters upon the Navy or Mercantile Marine or upon the State or civil aircraft of any one of the High Contracting Parties by the air forces of any other High Contracting Party.&quot;A possible alternative would be to omit the geographical definition in the second paragraph of Article 1, and to employ a more general phrase on the linea of the first part of Article 1 of the French draft,* such as : &quot; In the event of one of the High Contracting Parties being the object of unprovoked aggression in Europe by way of the air on the part of another High Contracting Party . . . .&quot;In that case, the question of whether an attack on or over the high seas upon the Fleet, Mercantile Marine or aircraft constituted aggression within the meaning of the Article would be left to be determined in the particular case.Article 2.13. It has been suggested by the Air Ministry that Article 2 should be slightly re-worded so as to make it clear that the &apos;&apos; war &apos;&apos; referred to in line 3 was a &quot; current &quot; war and not merely an historical event. We are advised that this is merely a question of drafting and that there will be no difficulty in meeting this view.14. It was further pointed out by the Air Ministry that, as the drafting stood, a Contracting State &quot; A&quot; could make an air attack upon another Contracting State &quot; B &quot; without bringing the mutual guarantee of assistance into operation if &quot; B &quot; had resorted to war in violation of treaty obligation against a third State &quot; C.&quot; We are in agreement that, as the draft stands, there would be some doubt in this direction, and an alternative draft of Article 2 has been suggested as follows : &quot; It is understood that action carried out in the cases provided for in Article 2, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, of the general Treaty of Locarno, or in execution either of the commitments of guarantee and security described in Articles 1, 4 and 5 of the said Treaty, or of the commitments resulting from the present Convention, can in no case be regarded as &apos; unprovoked aggression.&apos; &quot;At the same time, we suggest that this revision should not be put forward at Geneva at the present stage until it has been seen how the results of the discussions on this question emerge.* Foreign Office Print No. C 1657/55/18, dated February 20, 1935.[11647] b 2
Summary of Conclusions.Preamble.(1) We suggest that the draft produced for discussion should omit the condition (in the Preamble and in Article 7) that the pact operates only as part of a &quot; general settlement,&quot; though this will not prevent the desirability or necessity of such condition being considered before the pact is finally agreed. We are of opinion that it is at least desirable to accompany the Aerial Convention by an agreement regarding limitation in air armaments.(2) We consider it most desirable that some such reference as is at present drafted in the Preamble should be made to the anxiety to safeguard civil popula-tions against indiscriminate air attack. It would be preferable to draft an article defining clearly the legitimate targets for air attack, but a watertight article of this nature would be difficult to construct and might well cause a break-down in agreement as a whole. We therefore suggest that the present phraseology is sufficient.A rticle 1.(3) We are of the opinion that there is no objection to inserting the words &quot; deliberate and &quot; before &quot; unprovoked aggression &quot; in line 2 of Article 1, though we are inclined to the view that this addition would not make much difference to the interpretation of the Article and that, in making any such suggestion to the other Parties, we should not insist on this point.(4) While we do not differ from the opinion of the Chiefs of Staff that the responsibility for the final decision to enter war must rest on each country con-cerned, we are reluctant to recommend the specific inclusion of such a saving clause for the following reasons : (a) Article 1 as already drafted appears to cover this requirement in that,by the inclusion of the word &quot;unprovoked&quot; before &quot;aggression,&quot; decision still rests with each Party as to whether the aggression which has occurred is unprovoked or not.(b) We fear that, if any such saving clause were inserted, it would detractfrom its present crispness and deprive it of its value in many eyes. It might well be interpreted as an attempt to provide us with a loophole for escape from actual co-operation if and when the moment arose.(5) We suggest that it is for Cabinet decision whether the scope of the Convention, the original intention of which was to deal with the possibilities of a &quot; bolt from the blue,&quot; should be enlarged to cover cases of unprovoked aggression outside territorial waters. Should the Cabinet so decide, there are two alterna-tive forms which the additions could take : (a) by adding at the end of the first paragraph of Article 1, the following :  &quot; The same shall apply in the event of unprovoked aggression in European waters upon the Navy or Mercantile Marine or upon the State or civil aircraft of any one of the High Contracting Parties by the air forces of any other High Contracting Party.&quot;Articles 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.15. There is nothing in dispute as regards the present drafting of these remaining Articles.16. We realise that the form which the pact may ultimately take will not be governed solely by the language preferred by one particular signatory, and our report is not designed to crystallise the final view of the British Government on the expression or even the content of every article, or to limit unduly the authority of our negotiators. This report is designed to get rid of as many outstanding points of possible difference between Departments as may be, and to record the plan upon which we all think that the pact should proceed.
(b) by omitting the geographical definition in the second paragraph of Article 1 and employing a more general phrase on the lines of the first part of Article 1 of the French draft, such as : &quot; In the event, of one of the High Contracting Parties being the object of unprovoked aggression in Europe by way of the air on the part of another High Contracting Party . . . .&quot;A rticle 2.(6) We suggest that Article 2 should be re-drafted to read as follows : &quot;It is understood that action carried out in the cases provided for in Article 2, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the general Treaty of Locarno, or in execution either of the commitments of guarantee and security described in Articles 1, 4 and 5 of the said Treaty, or of the commitments resulting from the present Convention, can in no case be regarded as &apos; unprovoked aggression &apos;.&quot;At the same time we suggest that this revision should not be put forward at Geneva at the present stage until it has been seen how the results of the discussions on this question emerge.Articles 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.(7) There is nothing in dispute as regards the drafting of these remaining Articles.(Signed on behalf of the Committee) : JOHN SIMON (Chairman).2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1. June 3, 1935.
