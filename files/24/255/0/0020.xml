THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 03? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET COPY   NO.        U- *CP. 105(35).CABINET.International laboirr Conference, Geneva Nineteenth Session, June,1955.Proposed Instructions to the British Government Delegates on thesubject of the 40-Hour Week.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour,1.     The subject of the 40-hour week has already been discussed at a special Conference in January 1933 and at the annual conferences in 1933 and 1934.    It is again on the Agenda of the coming International Labour Conference together with Unemployment among Young Persons (including raising of the school age and of the age of admission to employment, vocational training and employment centres) and Holidays with Pay, and this association of proposals, which have been strongly advocated in this country for the solution of the unemployment problem, will give the discussions at this Conference considerable importance.2.      At the special Conference in January 1933, which was called on the initiative of the Italian Government, it was decided to place the subject on the Agenda of the International Labour Conference of that year- with a view to the immediate formulation of a Draft Convention.    That Conference, however, decided to issue a Questionnaire to all States Members.    This Questionnaire was fully answered by very few Governments and there was much difference of opinion both on the practicability of adopting a Convention and on the provisions of such a Convention.    The British Government expressed the view that an international convention   was impracticable in the existing circumstances and that this subject could only be discussed, whether nationally or internationally, industry by industry.    It was further stated at the Conference that the replies received provided no proper basis on which to proceed to formulate definite proposals.
3.     Nevertheless, the International Labour Office placed   a Draft Convention before the Conference of 1934 and suggested its adoption.     The Conference decided to have this Draft Convention considered by a Committee but the Employers&apos; Group, with the exception of the Italian Employers&apos; Delegate refused to take part in the discussions.     In Committee certain amendments were made on the initiative of the Workers&apos; Group (most of which amendments were supported by the British Government Delegate) with the result that several countries no longer found themselves able to support the adoption of a. Convention.     The most important amendment was to provide for the inclusion of small undertakings within the scope of the proposals which brought in a large part of industry and commerce in such countries as Italy and Belgium which they had hoped to exclude.     Consequently there were so many abstentionswhen the vote was taken in the Conference that the quorum was not reached.4.     The Italian Government Delegate, with a desire to prevent a total loss of the proposals,  drafted a resolution which was considered by a Committee of seven Government Delegates, including the British Government Delegate.     This resolution was substantially changed, particularly by including the subject of wages as a subject of inquiry, and in its new form was unanimously adopted by the Government Delegates at the Conference.     This resolution provided for the further consultation of Governments and directed the Governing Body to decide, on the basis of the replies, to consider whether the matter should again be placed on the Agenda of the-Conference.5.     This unanimous decision of the Government Delegates was upset, before it could be submitted to the Conference, by a further resolution put forward by the Italian Government Delegate...     This resolution provided for a less definite inquiry and instructed the Governing Body definitely to place the subject on the Agenda this year.     The Government Delegates were thus again given freedom of
action and the British Government Delegate, supported by some other Governments, including Japan and Holland, placed the original unanimous resolution before the Conference.     The Italian Government proposal, however, which was supported by the Workers&apos; Group, was carried by 75 votes to 37.6.     In the final discussion the Italian Government Delegate proposed that there should be a three clause &quot;Convention of Principle&quot; and that individual industries should be scheduled with the necessary modifications.     This proposal was later adopted by the Governing Body, by a majority, and the Office was instructed to frame such a Convention.     As regards the industries to be scheduled at once, the Workers&apos; Group wished practically all to be included but their proposals were not accepted, the industries decided upon for immediate treatment beingPublic Works undertaken or subsidised by Government, Iron and Steel,Building and Contracting,Glass Bottle,Coal Mines.7.     The International Labour Office, however, has found it to be impossible to draft a &quot;Convention of Principle&quot; and the Governing Body, against the wishes of the Italian Government and the Workers&apos; Group, has decided to propose to the Conference the adoption of separate Conventions for individual industries, commencing with those named above, and Draft Conventions have been prepared by the Office for consideration by the coming Conference.     As a measure of satisfaction to those who wish to have a general committal to the principle of the Forty-Hour Week, a Draft Resolution has also been prepared for submission to the Conference.      (See Appendix).
8.     A general discussion will take place on the Draft Resolution and on this there appears to be no reason to depart from the policy upon which the British Government has so far acted;   namely,    that the question of the reduction of hours can only be discussed industry by industry and that it cannot be properly discussed independently of the question of wages.     In that case the British Government Delegates should either abstain in the vote on the Resolution or -vote against it on the ground that the Conference has so far no sufficient evidence that the application of the Forty Hour Week internationally is practicable at the present time. 9.     With regard to the Draft Conventions for the industries named above,   it appears to be impossible to accept the proposal that Public Works undertaken or subsidised by Governments should be treated as being capable of distinction as regards working conditions from similar work carried out by private employers.       The anomaly would lee particularly marked in the case of contractors engaged on both public and private work of a similar character - a numerous class of employer.      They would find themselves obliged by the State to give those of their workpeople who happened to be employed on public contracts,   working conditions differing from those which they were driven by competition,    or bound by trade practice,    to give the men employed on private contracts.      As defined by the Office, &quot;Public Works&quot; covers many industries,    including railways and public utilities,   and it would be contrary to both Government and private interests to support the principle that more favourable working conditions should operate in the case of Government-aided work.      In general the Fair Wages principle is followed in this country and any departure from it in the direction proposed would have serious consequences which would not be confined to Government work      It is proposed, therefore, that a separate Convention for this work should be opposed by the British Government Delegates.
10*     With regard to the Draft Conventions for the other&apos; industries named,    it is clear that there is no adequate basis upon which decisions can properly be reached this year, especially as, apart altogether from the pra.ot.ical difficulty of accepting an obligation to reduce hours of work,   no adequate consideration has been given to the question of wages *     The proposal of the Office is the adoption of a form of compulsory arbitration, a policy which is unacceptable in this country.     It is suggested, therefore,    that the British Government Delegates should support the alternative proposal to formulate questionnaires upon which Governments can be consulted before any decisions are taken.        In doing so reference could be made to the consultations with the Delegates of the various industries which are now taking place. 11.      Subject to any observations which my colleagues may wish to make,    the Government Delegates will accordingly be instructed that they:-(i) have discretion either to abstain from voting on the Resolution (see Appendix) or to vote against it on the grounds set out above (paragraph 8); (ii) should oppose the adoption of a separate Convention for Public Works (paragraph 9); and(iii) should support the proposal to formulate questionnaires in respect of the other industries (paragraph 10).(Itld. )   0.

APPENDIX. DRAFT RESOLUTION ON THE REDUCTION OF HOURS OF WORK.Whereas unemployment has become so widespread and long continued that there are at the present time many millions of workers throughout the world suffering hardship and privation for which they are not themselves responsible and from which they are justly entitled to be relieved;Whereas it is desirable that -workers should as far as practicable be enabled to share in the benefits of the rapid technical progress which is a characteristic of modern industry;Whereas in pursuance of the Resolution adopted by the Eighteenth Session of the International Labour Conference it is necessary that a continuous effort should be made to reduce hours of work in all forms of employment to such extent as is possible;uTho Conference therefore declares its approval of the principal of the forty-hour week as the general international standard of hours of work and as a guide for the action of the Members of the Organisation, without prejudice to further reductions of hours where circumstances permit;The Conference will proceed, at the present and subsequent Sessions, to the considera.tion of a series of Draft Conventions for the progressive application of this principle to the whole field of employment, having regard to the special circumstances of particular groups of establishments or classes of workers.The Conference accordingly decides to refer to a committee for consideration the reports prepared by the International Labour Office on the application of the reduction of hours of work to:(a) public works undertaken or subsidised, by Governments;(b) iron and steel;(c) building and contracting;(d) glass bottle manufacture;(e) co al mine s.
