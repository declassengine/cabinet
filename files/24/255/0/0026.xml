CONFIDENT IAL,A.C.   324.BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.STATE OF TRADE - APRIL,   1955.Summary of Reports5   submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS TRADE.    Imports in April at  59.8 m. were  3.5 m. more than in 1934,  imports of food,  drin^c and tobacco increasing by  1.6 m.  and of articles wholly or mainly manufactured by  2.0 m.      Imports of raw materials at  16.9 m. were only slightly less than a year ago.      Exports of United Kingdom produce and manufactures were  33.0 m.,  or  2.9 m. more than in April,  1934.      The rise was largely due  to increased exports of manufactured goods.      Re-exports were  4.2 m.  as compared with  5.0 m.EMPLOYMENT.      Employment in April showed a further improvement,   affecting most of the principal industries.    The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges at loth April was 2,044,460,  a decrease of 109,410 as compared with a month earlier.The main variations we re: -London ..........00...  - 17,854South Eastern . ...... .  - 9,231South Western ........  - 9,230Midlands  ............. - 13,129North Eastern ........ - 31,832North Western  ........ - 15,376Scotland  .............  - 9,657If/ales  .........0000000 - 5,121The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-64 inemployment at 15th April was 10,320,000.      This was 120,000 morethan a month earlier and 175,000 more than a year ago.      the april figure was the highest recorded during the period overfourteen years for which comparable figures  -are available.
Improvement was most marked during the month in &quot;building, coal mining,  the woollen and worsted industry,  tailoring,  the distributive trades,  and the hotel and boarding house services, but substantial improvements were also recorded in many other industries.      None of the principal industries showed any marked decline in employment.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.     During the four weeks ended 28th April railway traffic receipts increased by  478,000  (4.44%) over the corresponding period of 1934.      Passenger traffic increased by 16.47 per cent.,  but there was a decrease of 5.65 per cent, in coal and other fuel and of 3.23 per cent,  in other freight traffic.    The comparison of last year is affected by the incidence of the Easter holidays.      The total receipts for the 17 weeks ended 28th April amounted to  45.7 m.  as against  46.0 m. for the same period in 1934.SHIPPING.      The index number for shipping freights (1913 = 100) was 77.61 in April as against 75.60 in March and 75.60 twelve months ago.      The increase is due to arrangements made for minimum freights in the River Plate and Australian trades.BANKING.    In general the Banks&apos; minimum rate of ^% ruled -throughout the month in the money market.      This was also the average rate for all maturities,   including three months&apos;  bills. The average tender       rates for Treasury bills were consistent at about 10/2d%.      In the foreign exchange market there was some nervousness regarding gold currencies until the middle of the month.      The principal &quot;spot&quot; rates remained unusually steady, however,    though forward francs were at a considerable discount.      The price of gold continued to show a premium over the franc and the dollar.      Silver continued to rise from SS^d.  on the 2nd to 36^d.  on the 26th under the stimulus of tbe increase in the price fixed by the United States Government for the purchase of home produced silver.      The London price,  in
fact,  went above the U.S.A.. buying price of 35 7I6d. owing to the operations of speculators.COAL.    The average weekly output for the quarter ended 27th April was 4.48 m.  tons as compared with 4.63 m. tons in the corresponding period of 1934,  a decrease of 3.15%. The average number of persons employed during this period was 770,000 as compared with 788,000 a year ago.      Exports in April,   1935,  were 2.87 m.  tons as against 2.93 m.  tons in April last year.      Exports in April to the Irish Free State, Sweden, Denmark, and Italy all showed increases over last year, but there was a decrease in exports to Prance, Brazil and North Africa generally.IRON AND STEEL.      Business was quiet at the beginning of April owing to uncertainty whether Belgian makers would continue to observe Cartel prices in spite of the devaluation of the Belga.      For a time lower prices were quoted which partly allowed for the increased duties in the country but with the Cartel Agreement there was a return early in May to previous price quotations.      It is understood  that the Continental quota for the British market has already been booked.New orders for pig iron were somewhat disappointing,  but have been a little brighter since the holidays,  especially with the resumption of exports to Italy.      Business in the semi-finished steel section is at a comparatively low level as consumers are known to be carrying heavy stoci.cs.      The finished steel market was firmer towards the end of April thanks chiefly to home demand,  although there was some expansion in the export business.In Sheffield the flow of new orders has been higher than the demand usual during April.      The North East Coast has been adversely affected by the uncertainty as to Belgian prices and Cartel discussions,  and the shipbuilding industry on the Wear
and Tees is very depressed.    Since the beginning of May the 1 outlook has improved and producers report more orders.      In Scotland the production of finished and semi-finished steels was well maintained, but some apprehension is felt as to new orders owing to the decline in activity in the Clyde shipbuilding yards and in constructional works.      In South Vales the decline in tinplate production has had repercussions on the steel trade but the outlook has improved since the holidays.MOTOR INDUSTRY.    Motor vehicles newly registered in March amounted to 42,130,  an increase of 5,003  (.13.5%) over a year ago.      The increase comprised 4,305 private cars and 698 other vehicles.The home market shows satisfactory expansion though some apprehension is felt as to imports of the high horse-power class of motor car.LIGHT -METAL INDUSTRIES.      Non-ferrous metal mills remain busy.    Copper prices have advanced moderately with the new restriction scheme;    tin,  lead and spelter prices have been firm.Busy conditions prevail in the hollow-ware,  press work and tool trades.      Conditions in the foundry industry are favourable and there is some expansion in the lock and allied trades.      There is little change in the needle and fishing tackle industries or in metal smallwares.      The cutlery trade remains patchy and prices show little,  if any,  profit.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.    The production of electricity in April was 1,330 m. units as compared with 1,188 m.  in April,  1934.      The increase in production for the first four months of the year was 10.5 per cent.      Home and export orders for heavy plant both show considerable increases over a year ago, the index being 115 as compared with 62 (1920 = 100).      Lxports of light  apparatus  (including wire and  cables) amounted in April to  718,000 as compared with  569,000 a year ago,  while-imports were  214,000 as compared with  233,000 last year.-4-
SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.      The trade in rayon yarns is not brisk but the outlook is encouraging,,      The underwear trade has improved slightly, but the hosiery trade is still quiet. Exports of. singles yarn for. the first four months of this year show a considerable expansion over the same period a year age Imports of yarn, however, show only a slight increase over the same period.      Business in rayon piece goods has been maintained, but prices remain extremely low.      Imports of piece goods were less than in April,  1934.    Exports of all-rayon fabrics show an improvement over April,  1934, &quot;but  those of mixture fabrics are still below last year&apos;s levelo    Japanese competition is being felt in many Empire marketsDThe price of raw silk showed little change.      Sales of piece goods were not quite maintained and the trade continues to suffer from the importation of Cheap Japanese goods mostly in the grey.COTTON.      There was a marked increase in employment during the month     Average weekly deliveries of raw cotton to spinners were 24.87 m.  lbs.  as against 26.15 i, lbs.  in March and 25.82 m. lbs.  in April last year.    The decrease in April this year is no doubt due to the incidence of the Easter holiday. There was a general recovery during the month in the prices of the chief types of cotton.There was some tendency for spinners&apos; margins to be reduced, particularly in the Egyptian section.Exports of grey yarn during April were 9.08 m.  lbs. against 10.07 m.  lbs.  in March and 9.69 m.  lbs.   in April,  1934. As compared with March,  exports to the Argentine increased but there -was a heavy drop in shipments to India,  Germany and. Scandinavia.      Exports in April of piece goods were 159.5 m. sq. yards against 183.2 m.  sq. yards in March and 153.6 m. sq. yards in April last year.      Compared with March,   exports to India and most other parts of the Empire,  except the British
West Indies,  decreased.    In the case of India,  Ceylon, Malaya and British West Africa they were substantially in excess of those of April,  1934.     Among Continental markets there was an expansion in shipments to Roumania and Turkey, but exports to Scandinavia, Holland, Portugal, Greece and Switzerland declined. There was also a falling off in business with Egypt,  the Congo, Morocco and French West Africa.    Shipments to Persia were larger than in March, but this was more than offset by a decline in exports to China and the Dutch East Indies0    In Central and South America,  exports to the Argentine increased, hut elsewhere there was some contraction.WOOLo      There was a slight improvement in the general activity of the industry in April as compared with the previous month, but in practically all sections and districts the position continued to be unsatisfactory.      There was a considerable decrease in exports of tops, yarns and tissues during April as compared with March.      Raw wool prices developed an upward trend during the month.CHEMICALS.        Home alkali deliveries during April were satisfactory, but exports although better than a year ago were less than in previous months.      Sales of heavy chemicals were normal.      Domestic sales of dyestuffs maintained the improvement over the corresponding period of last year and foreign sales for the first four months of the year are nearly equal to the figure a year ago.      Steady conditions are reported in most other markets.SOAP,  OILS AND KINDRED INDUSTRIES.      fiusiness in soap was normal during the month except in the cheaper qualities, while margarine on the whole maintained the improvement noted in recent months.      The demand for edible oils and fats was    considerably in excess of that a year ago owing partly to a general rise in the price of raw materials.
CEMENT.      United Kingdom exports of cement for the first four months of 1935 are somewhat below those of last year. The compensation trade policy of Germany and the German policy of making the domestic trade pay for losses sustained on exports (manufacturers having to contribute to an export fund 1 mark for every ton of cement sold in the domestic market) are causing apprehension,  and the devaluation of the Belga is another disturbing feature,POTTERY.      In the first quarter of the year,  sales in the home trade in all sections were not so good as in 1934.    In April, however,  there was an increased activity all round and a better tone.      A satisfactory feature of the trade is the increase in exports as compared with a year1 ago.RETAIL TRADE.      The money value of retail sales in March was 0.6$ greater than in March,  1934.      The small increase is due to the fact that Easter this year fell in April whereas in 1934 it came earlier in the year and affected retail sales in March.    Sales of food and perishables were 3.6% greater than in March last year, while sales in all other departments fell by 3.1%.      Every area showed an increase in sales of food,  except London (West End), but Scotland was the only district to show an increase in sales of merchandise other than food.6Preliminary figures for April show a marked increase in sales, but this again must be attributed in large measure to the incidence of Easter.CO-OPERATIVE TRADE.      The Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s sales for the five weeks ended 13th April showed an increase of 10o5% over a year ago.    The weighted average of the wholesale prices of seven of the principal commodities showed an increase of 3.09% as compared with a year ago and the weighted average of the retail prices of the same commodities has increased by
EMPIRE    TRADE. Canadian Trade.     Moderate improvement was shown in economic conditions in March,   though productive operations slackened,  the index of the physical volume of business being 94.2 as against 100o6 in February.      There was a slight gain in wholesale prices.      Exports of copper and silver and imports of &quot;bauxite increased, but exports of nickel declined.      The food industries were not quite so active while despite a gain in newsprint production the forestry index fell.    The output of motors increased.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.      The number of bales of wool received into store between 1st July and the end of March was 2.63 m. as against 2.48 m.  a year ago.    Of these 2.1 m. have been disposed of as against 2.4 m. a year earlier.    Wheat and flour shipments (1st December to 29th April) are equivalent to 49.2 m. bushels of wheat as against 40.3 m. bushels in the same period last year.      Exports of butter for the season amount to 107,000 tons as against 92,000 tons a year ago.      The total imports of merchandise in March were  8.4 m.  (Australian currency) as compared with  5.8 m. last year.SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.      The increased price of gold and the consequent greater activity in the mines have led to business expansion on the Reef.      Most manufacturing industries are kept busy and the outlook is favourable.    The cost of living index for February showed no appreciable change.INDIAN TRADE.      There was a decrease both in imports and exports in April,  1935,  as compared with March.      Imports declined from 12,37 lakhs in March to 11,55 lakhs in April and exports from 15,66 lakhs to 10,93 lakhs.    The wholesale price index number at Calcutta was 88 as compared with 87 for the previous month.    Rain has been wanting over most parts in India.
Standing crops are stated to be in average to good condition, except in some districts of Madras.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.General.      The gradual improvement in eoonomic conditions continues and there are signs that United States bankers may recommence loans to Argentina.Argentina.      Exports for the first quarter of 19 35 show an increase of 7.7% and imports an increase of 16. 3fS over a year ago.      The cereal markets have been firmer and wool has been purchased on German account.      British imports into Argentina are for the most part well maintained but there is severe competition from Japan in cotton textiles,  and from the U*S.A. in tinplates for meat packing.      New exchange regulations calculated further to reduce the quantity of imports effected without prior exchange permits should assist British manufacturer since there is no present difficulty in obtaining such permits for British goods.    Messrs. Stewarts and Lloyds and the Mannesmann Tube Company have secured a contract worth  250,000 for the supply of well tubing to the Government oil fields.Brazil.      It Is estimated that British investments in Brazil in 1934 yielded  4.9 m.  in interest.    The amount invested was  274.2 m.  and of this there was no return at all on  111.1 m.    Coffee exports showed a further decline.    Cotton exporters have paid penalties in order to break contracts with Liverpool merchants and sell their output to Germany, who took nearly the whole of Brazil&apos;s exports during the first two months of the year.In Chile considerable imports of equipment and plant -particularly textile machinery - are taking place,  and the exchange control is understood to be giving preference to imports of this character.
In Peru business was less active in March. Cotton exports in 1934 were the largest on record, 62.8% being imported by the United Kingdom.In Uruguay in 1954 there was a substantial decrease in exports to the United Kingdom and a corresponding increase in exports to Germany and the U.8.A.In Colombia, business activity is increasing.
