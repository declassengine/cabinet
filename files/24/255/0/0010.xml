(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT). SECRET, I .CP.   95  (35). COPY NO.CABINET.STATUS OF MARRIED WOMEN AND JOINT TORT PEASORS BILL.50Memorandum by the Lord. ChancellornThese two subjects have been considered by the Law Revision Committee which has been sitting under the Chairmanship of the Master of the Rolls, and they have produced reports upon them proposing certain amendments in the law relating to each matter.The matter,  so far as it relates to joint tort feasors, is entirely non-controversial, and I do not anti-participate that any discussion can arise in either House upon the proposals of the Master of the Rolls&apos;  Committee.So far as concerns the status of married women, no matter arises which can justly be regarded as one of contro-versy.      I have received deputations consisting of (l) the women Members of Parliament,  and (2)  certain Women&apos;s Societies,The former body of ladies accepted with enthusiasm the proposals of the Committee.      The latter deputation, while they would have preferred that on some matters (which were outside the terms of reference to  the Committee)  the proposals had gone further, were willing and anxious to see effect given to the proposals.      I, therefore, caused a. Bill to be prepared on both these  subjects and now ask the leave of my colleagues to allow me to bring, it before the Home Affairs Committee at the earliest practicable meeting.      I propose
that the Bill? tif accepted by the Cabinet on the report of the Home Affairs Committee,,  should be introduced in the House of Lords,  and I am anxious to make progress with it at this stage of the Session.(Intld.)    SoHouse of Lords, 9th May,  1935.
