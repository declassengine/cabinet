(THIS DOCUMENT&apos;IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS 5RlT:AHh7IC MAJESTY1-S ^GOVERNMENT . )*2S 1 C R E T . CP. 120  (35)C A B I ..N.E T .Copy NoEmployment of Women and Young Persons on the Two Shift System in Factories and Workshops.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I desire to bring before my colleagues the question of legislation for the purpose of placing on a permanent basis the temporary provisions contained in section 2 of -the Employment of Women,  Young Persons and Children Act,  1920,  under which women and young persons may be employed in a factory or workshop on a system of two day-shifts.      These provisions empower the Secretary  j of State on the joint application of the employer and a majority of the workers concerned to make Orders permitting the employment of women and young persons of 16 years and upwards in shifts averaging not more  than 8 hours each between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. on Monday to Friday and 6 a.m.  to 2 p.m.  on Saturday.      In practice this means an average working week for the shift workers of 41-g- hours or,  in textile works,  40  hours,  and as the shifts usually alternate weekly,  the workers have a free Saturday every second week.      Under the ordinary provisions of the Factory Acts a period of employment of 12 hours duration  (8 hours on Saturday) is allowed for women and young persons but the period must (as a rule)  end not later than 8 p.m.  and there must be the same period for all.During the 14 years in which these powers have been in force,   over 2,000 Orders have been granted,   of which about 800 are still &quot;live&quot; Orders,  i.e. in use or likely to- be used again, and the number employed under these &quot;live&quot; Orders is calculated at about 36,000,  of whom about 29,000 are women.      The Orders apply to a great variety of works, but the majority of the workers concerned
are employed in half a dozen industries  in which there have been important developments since the War (artificial silk, hosiery, electrical engineering (wireless) and rubber tyres).The provisions of the Act of 1920 were enacted first for a period of five years by way of experiment, but in view of favourable reports by the Factory Department, have since been continued from year to year under the Expiring Laws Continuance Acts.      Their continuance, however, has been strongly criticised by the Labour Party,  and in June of last year my predecessor appointed a Departmental Committee to inquire into the question. This Committee after an exhaustive inquiry have now presented a unanimous report  (Cmd. 4914)  in which they recommend that the two shift system should be continued on a permanent basis.      They summarise their conclusions on this point as follows:&quot;(1)    The value of the system to industry for a variety of purposes has been clearly established.      In particular, it has enabled many branches of industry to meet changing conditions of trade and employment,  and has facilitated important new developments.      In some industries, more especially the highly mechanised industries,  it helps manufacturers to reduce costs of production and to meet foreign competition.      As a method of meeting seasonal rushes of work,  short notice orders demanding quidk delivery, breakdowns and other forms of pressure,  it is more elastic than overtime and, from the point of view of fatigue at least, preferable for the worker.(2)    While the evidence a,s to the value of the system as a normal method of industrial organisation - apart from special conditions - is much less complete,  in the instances where we have found it so used,  it is working satisfactorily and giving good results;    and the considerations which are enumerated above,  in our opinion, warrant the conclusion that, in view of possible future changes and developments,
-3-174it has a real potential value.(3)    While we recognise that,  &quot;day&quot;  employment being the mode  of life of the great majority of the population,  a system of employment which dissociates the individual in some measure from the normal life around him or her has  its disadvantages, these disadvantages are,  in part at least,   offset by the advantages of shorter hours,  a division.of the day which gives the worker leisure during one half of the day-time,  a free Saturday in alternate weeks   (in most cases),  and the wider opportunities of employment which the system does,  in some degree,  afford.      The shift system is no new thing in industrial organisation in this country;    it is only a novelty in the employment of women and girls&quot; .The Committee adhere generally to the main features of the existing system.      They consider that official permission should continue to be necessary in each case before the system is started, and that  (except in certain cases of new works)  the consent of the majority of the workers concerned should continue to be required. The former requirement has enabled the Home Office to ensure that any special welfare arrangements necessary to meet the abnormal conditions of work,   are made and maintained, while the latter has been of great value to the workers in assisting them to maintain their standards of wages.At the same time the Committee propose certain minor modifications,  some of which are important from the workers&apos;  point of view and involve amendment of the existing section.      For example,  they recommend that a definite procedure should be laid, down for ascertaining the opinions of the workers where their consent is required;    that where permission is granted for the purpose of meeting a temporary emergency,  it should be limited to a definite period covering the probable duration of the  emergency;    and that where the use of the system has been discontinued for a prolonged
13th June,   1935 .period, permission should be deemed.to have expired.The Committee, which was presided over by Sir Malcolm Delevingne,  was a very representative one.      The employers were represented by General Baylay,  selected by the National Confederation of Employers&apos;  Organisations, and the workers by Mr. Charles Brown, M.P. and Miss Julia Varley,   selected by the Parliamentary Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress General Council.      It also included Dr. Howitt, M.D., M.P., Miss Megan Lloyd George, M.P., and Professor Winifred Cullis .The recommendations of the Committee appear to me to be sound and I  think legislation ought to be undertaken at an early date to give effect to them.      I should not anticipate, having regard to the fact that the Report is unanimous,  that legislation should give rise to any substantial controversy,      It is true that Labour has always been hostile,  but there is good reason to think that there is a general feeling now among prominent trade unionists that the system must be permanently accepted.There seem to be two alternatives - either to introduce at once a special Bill with a view to its being passed if possible during the present Session,  or to provide for the permanent continuance  of the existing section, without alteration,   in the Expiring Laws Bill of this year,  leaving its amendment to be dealt with when a general Factories Bill is undertaken.     Mr. Rhys Davies, M.P., who has been the Labour Party spokesman in the House of Commons in this matter,  has been consulted and ,has stated that he would prefer an early Bill rather than the continuance of the existing arrangements under the Expiring Laws Bill.      I agree in this view and shall he glad to have authority to prepare a Bill and submit  it to the Home Affairs Committee.J.S.
