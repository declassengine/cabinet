80?fES DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF, HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT.CABINET, RAILWAY FREIGHT REBATES SCHEME,Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of TransportsSECRETCopy No,1.      It is necessary for me to inform the Cabinet of serious results which may flow from certain recent decisions on the valuation of the Southern and London and North Eastern Railways.      The Local Government Act of 1929 provided that the railways should in future be rated at 25 per cent,  only of their net annual values,  and that amounts equal to the rating relief so accorded i.e.  three times the rates actually paid,  should be paid into the Railway Freight Rebates Fund (established Toy the Act) and &quot;be approximately^lied to the allowance of rebates from the railway carriage charges on certain selected traffics of the coal and iron and steel industries,  and of agriculture,  on a scale settled each year by the Railway Rates Tribunal.2.      The Railways (Valuation for Rating) Act, ijjo, provided for a revaluation of. each of the railways in cumulo by a new Railway Assessment Authority,  and pending the decisions of the Assessment Authority and the Courts, payments into the Rebates Fund have &quot;been based on provisional assessments in existence at the beginning of the quinquennium and have been at the rate of about  if millions a year over a period of four years,      The rebates have been fixed accordingly.3.      The Railway Companies have always contended that the existing assessments would be heavily reduced, but,  apart from the desire of the traders to secure distribution up to the total and immediate income of the Fund,   it has not been open
398to the Tribunal to proceed on any basis except that of the assessments actually for the time being in force.   When the matter was first considered in 1931 the Ministry of Health drew attention to the prejudice which might result to one or other of the parties if the Sates Tribunal were invited orauthorised to proceed on aiy other assumption, as that Tribunal would then in bffeot be attempting to make the assessment. The Tribunal themselves hold that it would he most undesirable that they should express any view on a matter upon which the Assessment Authority had still to reach a statutory decision.4.     The revaluation of the railways has proved a lengthy process and has even now been completed in the cases of the Southern and London arid Worth La&amp;tern Railways only.   Recently the Southern Railway Company appealed against the new valuation roll for their railway to the Railway aid Canal Commission, who reduced the net ennual value to be entered on the roll from  2,130,000, as fixed last year by the Assessment Authority,  to  1,077,000.   The Assessment Authority has decxi ed to appeal against this decision to the House of Lords, but meanwhile, in order that the House of Lords should have before them the full implications of the Railway end Canal Commissioners&apos; judgment,  they have announced that the application of the law, as decided in the Southern Railway case, to the London and North Eastern Railway in England and Vales produces, in their opinion, a nil assessment for that railway and they have accordingly substituted &quot;nil&quot; for the provisional valuation of  3,500,000 in the draft valuation roll.   The local authorities will no doubt appeal to the Railway and Canal Commission, and this case also is expected to be carried to the House of lords. If the present decisions are upheld there will be a debt due from the Rebates Fund to the two Companies of the difference
between the amounts which they have paid into the Fund since 1931 and those due under the new assessments.     The difference le estimated at about  1,220,000 a year, or over  6 millions for the quinquennium, as a whole.     Moreover, it must be assumed that the other two Gompanle s (the London, Midland and Scottish and Great Western) will also secure large reductions in their assessments, Involving further heavy repayments by the Fund. As the balance in the Fund at the end of last year was only  600,000, it is evident that the Fund would be insolvent and that the scheme of freight rebates would have to be suspended for a number of years until the debt was liquidated out of the depleted future revenues of the Fund.    The position which may ultimately have to be faced is being aggravated by the fact that notwithstanding its liabilities the Rebates Fund is still required to make payments in respect of rebates at the rate of about  75,000 a week out of moneys which it may later have to refund to the Companies.5.     It is evidence ent that until the legal issues have been decjd ed by the House of Lords, the extent of the problem cannot be assessed or the measures which may be desirable to meet it finally deci3 ed.   The Assessment Authority and all other parties concerned realise the desirability of tek ing every possible step to enable a final decision to be obtained as early as possible, but, if the situation has not in the meantime been clarified, the Rates Tribunal will be called on in the autumn of this year to review the Freight Rebates Scheme aid to fix the rates of rebates for a further year, with the accrued liabilities of the Fund unknown and its future revenue incapable of estimation.6.     I have shown that if the recent decisions are upheld the Rebates Fund will be mortgaged for some years to come to
repay to the Railwqy Companies their over-payments during the past four years, and that the debt will far exceed the immediate resources of the Fund.     There is no question of any refund by traders to whom rebates have been paid, but even a temporary suspension of the rebates would give rise to a serious outcry by the traders affected, and possibly to a demand that the Government should intervene.My examination of the possibilities of the situation suggests, however, that something might meanwhile be dono to save the Rebate Scheme from shipwreck if the Fund were permitted to borrow, over a term of years, the sum to be repaid to the Railway Companies and thus enable rebates to be continued at reduced rates.    It was indeed contemplated in the scheme that the adjustment of abnormal surpluses or deficiencies in the Fund brought about by exceptional occurrences (such as a stoppage in the coal mines) should be spread over a term of years so that wid e fluctuations in the rates of rebates might be avoided, and while no deficiency on the scale which now seems possible was envisaged, it will be reasonable to take advantage of such elasticity as the scheme affords.7,     There is, however, a statutory obstacle to the adoption of a spread over of the repayment by resort to borrowing.     The statute placed on the Railway Companies an obligation to bear half of any deficiency in the Fund arising from the operation of the rebates in any year, the other half being found out of a contingency reserve created from the revenues of the Fund itself, and in arriving at such a deficiency account has to be taken of any debit balance brought forward from a preceding year.     I am advised that this would mean that during the years in which the Fund was
in debit the Railway Companies would have to pay half of any rebates allowed out of their own resources.    In the situation which has developed, such a position would be inequitable aid contrary to the intention of the scheme which was designed to pass on to traders the benefit of derating and not to require the companle s to grant rebates at the expense of their own funds.   Nor could we justly seelc to offset any advantage to which the Railway Companies may be entitled as a result of any reduced assessments upon which the Courts finally determine.8.     I propose to sound&apos; the Railway Companies as to their readiness to co-operate in measures to keep the Rebates Scheme in existence in certain eventualities md it may be necessary in the autumn to ask permission to introduce, with a view to its passage as an urgent measure, a short Bill to effect certain amendments in the Eleventh bchedule to the Local Government Act, 1929.9,     I attach a note by the Board of Trade as to the effect of a suspension or substantial reduction of the rebates on the coal trade and other industries concerned.(lnt*d.) L.H-B.11th July, 1935.
31 9U* J. fvNOTE EY THE BOARD OF TRADE.It must be appreciated that a suspension or a substantial reduction of the rebates will have a very serious effect on some of the trades which have been receiving them. The rebates have amounted to approximately 3d. a ton on the . carriage to the ports of exported coal, and it is to be expected that the price of that coal must be increased to the extent to which the rebate is reduced.     Hot only will the inevitable increase in price result in a reduction of our exports of coal in the &quot;I^ree&quot; markets, and even in those in which our coal has an import       quota, but it will lead to protests from the governments with which trade agreements have been concluded making special provision for purchases of coal from us.      The other industries,  including the agricultural industry, must also be affected to a greater or less extent by the loss or reduction of their rebates.Protests must,  therefore, be expected from all these trades, and the introduction of any amending legislation would inevitably draw attention in Parliament to the main problem -the future of the rebates scheme in relation to the selected traffics,in particular export coal - a problem which in any event cannot be solved at present.
