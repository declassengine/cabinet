The need for these measures in no way implies a risk of war in the near future; nor does it imply any relaxation of effort on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to ensure the promotion and maintenance of peace by all the means in their power, and to use to the full the machinery of the League of Nations and other instruments for the guaranteeing of peace. These aims remain the unalterable basis of their foreign policy, as has been emphasised in the White Paper (Cmd. 4827) issued in connection with the House of Commons Debate on Defence on the 11th March, 1935, and in the speeches made by members of the Government in that Debate, and on other occasions.3. The measures which I am directed by the Secretary of State to bring to the notice of your Council by means of this circular are wholly precautionary and are, in general, such as have already been taken by the majority of European nations, as well as by countries in other parts of the world. The necessity for such measures must be apparent, and the Government would be neglect-The Clerk of the County Council.The Town Clerk.The Clerk to the County District Council.
2ing their duty to the .civil population men, women, and children   if they failed to take these precautions. Developments in the air have made it possible for air attacks on a large scale to be delivered, and delivered suddenly; on many parts of this country ; and despite the steps which the Government are taking to increase the Air Force for home defence and the ground anti-aircraft defences, it is im-possible to guarantee immunity from attack. The increasing speed of aircraft makes the task of the defence progressively more difficult, and their greater weight-carrying capacity adds to the damage which can be effected by even a single aircraft which eludes the defenders. So long as the risk of attack remains, it is necessary to create organisations in those parts of the country which are liable to attack for the purpose of minimising the consequences of attack and, as it would not be possible to improvise effective measures on the spur of the moment in time of emergency, prepara-tion must be made in time of peace. It is of the essence of any such preparation that the piyil population should be informed of the present and future possibilities of air attack and instructed in the precautions designed to meet it.4. His Majesty&apos;s Government strongly repudiate the idea of attacks on the civil population by means of indiscriminate bombing. Provision must nevertheless be made to minimise the consequences of such attacks if ever they should be delivered.5. The use of poison gas in war is forbidden by the Geneva Gas protocol of 1925, to which this country and all the most important countries of western Europe are parties, and His Majesty&apos;s Gpvern-ment sincerely hope that resort will never again be had to it. The risk of its being Used is, nevertheless, a possibility which cannot be disregarded, and the plans must therefore include measures for the protection of the civil population against gas attack.,6. His &apos;Majesty&apos;s Government have now set up the Air Said Precautions Department of the Home Office to act on behalf of the various Government Departments concerned.* This new depart-ment will be responsible for giving advice to local authorities and the civil population generally, in accordance with approved Govern -ment policy, and will act as a clearing house for the consideration of general questions arising out of the preparation of local schemes.7. Measures for safeguarding the civil population against the effects of air attack differ from the provision needed for other forms of national defence in that they must be orga-niSed locally, district by district, and that activity on the part of the central government cannot compensate for the failure of any district which* In relation to Scotland, the Air Raid Precautions Department of the Home Office will act in consultation with the Scottish Office, and communi-cations to Scottish local authorities or other Scottish bodies on the subject of air raid precautions will normally be issued through the Scottish Office ajr&apos; ottyer Scottish Departments concerned.
is liable to attack to take effective measures on its own account. The Government will issue general instructions, based on expert study of the problems, and will be ready to give technical and ad-ministrative advice, and to afford financial assistance towards the provision of additional hospital equipment and. stores,-where essen-tial in order to assure adequate reserves, as well as in the directions indicated in paragraph 9 below; but responsibility will rest on local authorities for ensuring that adequate measures of protection against air raid dangers are taken in their own districts.S. The construction on any extensive scale of shelters which would be proof against direct hits by bombs is impracticable. Such protection could be obtained only by means of concrete structures of great thickness or correspondingly costly works of equivalent strength, and apart from any other considerations the cost would be prohibitive. The Government cannot therefore undertake to provide money towards the construction of public bomb-proof shelters. On the other hand, effective protection against blast and splinters from bombs can be obtained at comparatively small cost, and it will be for occupiers of premises to provide this for them-selves and their households, and where necessary for their workers and customers. Specific advice on this subject will be made generally available.9. Protection against gas will need separate treatment. Informa-lion will be published as to the mea-ns by which occupiers of premises can make them gas-proof. Furthermore, His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided to accumulate reserves of respirators and protective clothing and to issue them at the cost of the Exchequer to persons employed on air raid precautionary services-e.g. police, fire brigades, first aid organisations whose, duties would require them to enter and to remain at work in gassed areas. Provision has. already been made for obtaining a first supply of respirators of approved types which will be allotted partly for training purposes and partly as reserve stocks. Arrangements will similarly be made to accumulate supplies of bleach powder for decontamination purposes. The Government will also establish a Civilian Gas School to provide training in anti-gas measures for instructors who will be competent to give local training in their own districts.10. For assistance in the enrolment and training of emergency personnel, especially for medical and anti-gas services, and in the task of instructing the general public in air raid precautions, the Government have been able to arrange with the Order of St. John and the British Bed Cross Society that their organisations will so far as practicable be placed at the disposal of both central and local governments to supplement official resources. This arrange-mentdoes not involve the acceptance of executive responsibility by these bodies, still less the assumption of functions properly belonging  to  local  authorities;   but  it is  hardly  necessary   to
emphasise the value to local authorities of being able to call on the assistance of the local representatives of these two existing organisations.11. The following notes are intended to give a preliminary picture of the various services needed for the protection of the public against the effects of air attack. The arrangements to be made by local authorities in connection with each service will be described in a series of memoranda to be issued by the Air Raid Precautions Department of the Home Office.(a) Air Raid Warnings. The Home Office will be respon-sible for the general arrangements, which will provide, so&apos; far as possible, means by which warning of an impending air attack may be communicated by telephone to the principal authorities in the districts which might be attacked.  -&apos;(b) Lighting Restrictions. The necessary Orders Will .be issued by the Home Office. The responsibility for their enforce-ment will rest on the police, but local authorities: will be concerned in the arrangements for reducing or extinguishing street lighting.(c) Reporting of Damage. It will be essential to. work out locally means for ensuring that information about the fall of bombs and the nature of the damage caused, including the presence of gas, is reported promptly and passed on to those by whom it is needed.(d) Police Forces. -The measures for supplementing the regular police by the employment of the first police reserve and special constables will proceed on lines which are provided for in the existing organisation.(e) Fire Brigades. The fire brigade service will need to be strengthened to enable it to deal effectively with the results of attack from the air. The Secretary of State has decided to appoint a Committee to explore this aspect of the problem, and in the meantime there are various measures which can be taken within the existing organisation which will be the subject of detailed memoranda from the Home Office.(/) Rescue Parties, etc. In order to relieve the police and fire brigades for the work for which they are essential, provision must be made for organising squads of men, equipped and trained for working in damaged buildings which are not on fire, to rescue persons who are injured or trapped, and to shore up dangerous walls, etc.(g) Treatment of Casualties. Provision must be made for the mobilization and expansion of the medical and first-a-id resources&apos; of each district so as to provide first-aid posts, casualty clearing stations, and hospitals for more extended treatment, together with an adequate ambulance service.   It
5will be necessary to provide in this connection facilities for the-decontamination of gas casualties and their clothing. Casualty clearing stations should be within easy reach of first-aid posts, but hospital treatment should as far as possible be provided outside areas of sjjecial danger. The detailed preparation of district schemes will be a matter for local organisation^(li) Anti-gas Services. The decontamination of persons and their clothing has been mentioned as part of the treatment of casualties. Sejmrate arrangements will have to be made for the decontamination of vehicles, buildings and their contents, and contaminated ground, as well a-s for the organisation of expert gas detectors who can determine whether a bombed area is free from gas or whether decontamination measures are needed.(i) Maintenance of Essential Public Services. It will be of vital importance that public services such as water, gas, and electricity should be kept going, at any rate on a- basis of minimum requirements. The statutory undertakers will re-main responsible for the necessary maintenance and repairs, but it will be essential to make arrangements for co-ordinating the work of repair where damage to different undertakings has occurred at the same point, and it will be for local authorities to secure this co-ordination in conjunction with their own re-responsabilities for the repair of roads, and with the work of the Post Office on the repair of telephone, etc., cables.(j) Road Repairs and Clearance of Debris. Road repairs will naturally remain the responsibility of highway authorities. It is hardly necessary to emphasise that the maintenance of the life of the community, including the functioning of the fire-fighting and casualties services, and the movement of materials for the repair of public utility services, will depend on the maintenance of an adequate system of usable roads. At the same time regard must be had in each case to the necessity or otherwise for postponing reinstatement of damaged roads pending the repair of buried pipes, cables, etc.12. The aspects of air raid precautions which will call for the co-operation of members of the public will form the subject of a series of Handbooks, one or more of which will contain advice to the public what to do in case of air attack, and a description of the precautions to be taken by householders and other occupiers of premises. Local authorities will no doubt endeavour to assist the inhabitants of their districts by arranging for their officers to give detailed advice, and by showing examples of what can be done in typical circumstances. Action in these directions should await the issue of the relevant Handbook.* It is intended that in the local areas wholly or partly within the Metro-politan Police District there shall he a special centralised organisation for dealing with casualties and decontamination of personnel.
013. In local organisation the principle to be generally followed should be that each local authority should undertake those services which are related to their normal functions. The consistent aim should be to make full use of all existing machinery, whether of local authorities or of other bodies, which could appropriately provide some needed emergency service. In the same way premises required for emergency purposes must in most cases be existing buildings, to be adapted at the time according to plans previously prepared. The success of the arrangements will depend largely on the ingenuity with which existing organisations and premises are planned for conversion to purposes of air raid precautions.14. At the same time unified plans for large areas are essential, so that common action may be assured and resources of men and material used to the best advantage. The largest areas of local government, those of the administrative county and the county borough, have therefore been adopted for the purpose. Even then close co-operation will be necessary between neighbouring authori-ties, whether county councils or county borough councils, and in many cases a satisfactory scheme will be possible only if neigh-bouring councils combine in a common scheme.15. In counties, where many of the services will fall to county district councils, especially those with large populations, the scheme for the county must be prepared in close consultation with those councils. It may be found convenient to organise some services for the county as a whole, with central administration; other services may best be organised with the district as the primary unit; but in every case the scheme should provide for the pooling of resources and for mutual assistance in case of need.16. It will be necessary to bring into the schemes other bodies besides local authorities, in particular statutory and other under-takers responsible for public services, such as water, gas and electricity.17. The Government would also invite local authorities to pay regard to the factors which have a bearing on the protection of the civil population against the effects of air attack when they are preparing schemes for town planning, for the lay-out of water and drainage systems, and for the provision of public works generally.18. The first step should he the preparation by each county council and county borough council of a general plan, in consul-tation with other authorities concerned and in combination with other county or county borough councils where advantageous. For this task, as well as for the subsequent development of local schemes, the Secretary of State suggests that the best course would be for each authority to appoint a small committee, of not mere than, say, seven members.   In counties the committee should
include one or more representatives of the Standing Joint CornV mittee. The detailed work will necessarily fall on the principal officers of the authority, and it will doubtless be found advantageous if these officers are constituted a sub-committee acting under the organising committee of the council, with the duty of preparing proposals for the consideration of the latter.19. The organising committees will probably find it convenient to await the memoranda on the several services before embarking on detailed preparations. In the meantime the Air Raid Pre-cautions Department of the Home Office will arrange to hold area conferences of representatives of the chief local authorities con-cerned, for the purpose of facilitating a start with local schemes.20. Por convenience of reference, a provisional summary of the principal types of action required for aid raid precautions is given in the Appendix to this circular. Any further copies of the circular which may be required for the use of your Council will be sent to you on application to the Home Office.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,R. R.
