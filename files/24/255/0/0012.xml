THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT.S E C R E T. Copy No........CABINET.CP. 97  (35)AIR RAID PRECAUTIONS .Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1.      In pursuance of the approved policy of the Government to begin public measures for the organisation of civil air raid precautions, an Air Raid Precautions Department of the Home Office has been set up, and the first important step to he undertaken by this new department will be the issue of a general circular to all local authorities in England and Wales directing their attention to the action they will be required to take .2.      The draft of this circular has been prepared in consultation with the other Departments concerned, and I need not trouble my colleagues in the Cabinet with it in detail. In general it will outline the problem from the point of view of local authorities, who will be responsible for preparing local schemes and organising local air raid precautions services, in accordance with detailed instructions and advice which will be issued to them in due course .3.      The points about which I wish to consult my colleagues in the Cabinet are three matters of general principle,  two of which it is desirable to mention in the circular.      The first question is the provision of air -raid shelters for the general public;    the second is the extent of the financial assistance to be afforded to local authorities by the Exchequer;    and the third is the means of providing respirators for the use of the general population.
A. Air Raid Shelters.4 .     I suggest that it mus,t &quot;be accepted, as a general principle, that it is impracticable to aim at providing air raid shelters for the general population at the public expense.      It appears that protection which would be proof against direct hits by-large bombs would require concrete structures of great thickness and corresponding cost,  and I propose to inform local authorities in the circular that no Government money must be expected to provide,  or assist in providing,  completely bomb-proof shelters. At the same time it will be made clear that splinter-proof,  and gas-proof,  accommodation is obtainable at comparatively small cost, and that it will in general be the responsibility of all occupiers to arrange for this in their own premises.B . Financial Assistance from the Exchequer.5 .      On the other hand,  there are a number of directions in which the Government will need to incur expenditure in time of peace, if the whole organisation of Air Raid Precautions is not to be abortive.(a) The men employed on Air Raid Precautions Services in every district will require to be equipped with respirators,  and a proportion of them will also need protective clothing.      These men will belong partly to existing public services - police, fire brigades, highway authorities&apos;  repair gangs,  etc . - and, for the remainder, will consist of specially recruited personnel -e.g. members of the St.  John Ambulance Association and the British Red Cross Society - who will receive no remuneration until the emergency arises,  though they will of course require a certain amount of training in time of peace.      It will be essential that the necessary supply of respirators and protective clothing for these services should be available the instant the emergency arises, and I see no means of guaranteeing this unless the Government accumulate the required stocks and hold them ready for is sue .
*(b) Much the same position arises in connection with the supply of bleach powder, which is essential for decontamination from mustard gas.      It is hoped that this situation can be met by an arrangement with Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd., who are practically the only manufacturers of bleach powder,  to hold continuously a required minimum stock.      This arrangement would involve a charge on the Exchequer.     The Treasury agree in principle that some provision by the Exchequer will he needed, and they suggest that the question what arrangements are possible should be explored with Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd., preferably through the P.S.O. Committee.(o) The training of local instructors in anti-gas measures will involve the provision of special courses of instruction. As I am advised that the instruction required will differ materially from that given at the Army Gas School, it is proposed to establish a new civil gas school solely for the training of civilian instructors.     The Treasury agree in principle that a school is needed.      I am in communication with them on the detailed arrangements.(d) As regards the provision for the treatment of air raid casualties, the scheme which has been worked out for London has shown that the normal supply of hospital bedo,  equipment and stores would be inadequate,  and it seems clear that satisfactory schemes in most parts of the country will require similar augmentation,  in an emergency,  of the available hospital accommodation and equipment.      After full consideration, I have reached the conclusion that there is no alternative but to provide for any necessary expenditure under this head as a charge to the Exchequer.     The Treasury consider that they have not yet sufficient information before them as to the arrangements contemplated, andI am discussing the question further with them.(e) An important feature of the new policy must be the provision of local lectures and courses of instruction for admits
in air raid precautions generally, and anti-gas measures in particular.      It is hoped that these will be organised mainly under the aegis of the Order of St. John and the British Red Cross Society,  and the question has already been raised by these bodies,  in particular cases, whether these lectures and courses of instruction can earn education grant.      It seems to me that these activities will be gravely handicapped if grant is withheld.      The payment of grant would mean that the cost of the lectures and instruction would be divided between the Exchequer and local rates.      As the extent of the Exchequer contribution would not amount to any considerable sum, I do not think it necessary to mention this point in the present circular.6.      I regret that I am unable to give an estimate of what these  charges on the Exchequer would amount to, and I cannot pretend that they are the only charges which will arise in connection with air raid precautions.     I am, however, satisfied that proper local organisation of air raid precautions cannot be secured without assistance from the Exchequer,  and I believe that an immediate announcement that assistance will be forth-coming in the directions which I have enumerated above will go very far towards securing the start of adequate local schemes. I therefore ask my colleagues to authorise me to include a reference to points (a) to (d) in the forthcoming circular, in terms to be agreed with the Treasury.C.    Respirators for the general population.7 .     Research is now being conducted into the possibility of designing a simple and cheap respirator for the use of the general population,  including children;    but it is too early as yet to say what solution will be found and what will be the lowest price obtainable.
13th May,   1935.8.     I do not propose to mention this matter in the circular, but I anticipate that I may be&apos;asked about it in Parliament, either on the Home Office Vote or at some other time. I therefore ask my colleagues to give me discretion to reply on the lines that research is proceeding and until some results are obtained it is impossible to frame a policy with regard . either to production or to means of supply to the public. I should also like to add that means will be found, if necessary by coming to Parliament for special powers,  to prevent the sale to the public of respirators which do not reach a sufficient standard of efficiency.      If I am pressed to consider the supply of respirators to the public free of charge,  I should like to be able to reply that so far as I know this policy has not he en adopted by any other country, and in any case until the type of respirator has been designed, and its production cost ascertained, the Government cannot decide whether it is possible or justifiable to subsidise its manufacture .J .
