THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1935.MOST SECRET. Copy No.CP. 116 (35).TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.AIR PARITY IN WESTERN EUROPE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1. . IN both public and confidential statements recently Herr Hitler has expressed his willingness to limit the size of Germany&apos;s Air Forces to parity with the other Western European Powers. In the recent speech in Berlin on the 21st May, 1935, Herr Hitler has said :- &apos;&apos; The German Government is prepared at any time to limit its armaments to any extent which is equally adopted by the other States. The German Government has already voluntarily made known certain limitations of its intentions. In this way it has done its best to show its goodwill to avoid an unrestrained world armaments race. Its limitation of the German air arm to a degree of parity with the other individual western Great Powers makes possible at any time the fixing of a maximum, which Germany will then undertake to regard as binding.&quot;During the Anglo-German Conversations in Berlin on the 25th and 26th March, 1935, Herr Hitler is reported (CP. 69 (35), on page 27), to have said : &apos;.&apos; If Britain would bring her air strength for the United Kingdom up to the French strength, i.e,, to&apos;parity with France, then it would be that parity which Germany would demand. If Britain persuaded France to come down to the British level, the German Government would be delighted because they would have to spend less on their air force. But even if Britain did not consider herself threatened by France, and preferred to have a smaller force than France, Germany could not help it because of the necessity of protecting herself.&quot;2. On the latter occasion Herr Hitler defined the basis on which he would calculate the French strength as follows :-&quot; The parity which he demanded was parity with the force in Metropolitan France plus that in North Africa.&quot;It is apparent, therefore, that in the absence of any agreement between our-selves and the French as to limitation, Hitler intends to build up to his own estimate of French strength, which General Goring has informed our air attache is of the order of 2,000 first-line aircraft, a strength which he hopes to attain this year (see telegram No. 203 from Berlin, dated 22nd May, 1935).

3. The French, according to information with which they supplied us only a few days ago, now claim that their actual strength in France and North Africa, excluding some 230 naval aircraft, is 1,528 first-line aircraft. This number is substantially higher than the figure of 1,404 first-line aircraft (including 135 naval aircraft) which was obtained from them confidentially earlier this year, and which was quoted by the Chief of the Air Staff in the memorandum attached to CP. 85 (35).4. The Air Ministry has now received information through the Air Attache in Paris that this increase is no more than a prospective one and that the reason for it is French uneasiness. Colonel Duvernoy, the Liaison Officer in the French Air Ministry, has informed him that the Germans take the French figure as 2,500 and at the same time are claiming parity in the air. It is therefore necessary for the French to make a very considerable effort to increase their air forces. So far from having 2,500 first-line aircraft (he said), the French at the present time have actually less than 1,000, not all of which are modern in type and performance. It might easily take two years for the French to reach their new figure. // some limitation could be agreed by Germany, and if they could rely on the sincerity of such an undertaking, the French would be only too glad not to have to build up to that number.5. It seems, therefore, that unless immediate action is taken, which will result at least in a modification of the German estimate of French strength, we must inevitably be faced with an attempt by France to increase her Metropolitan Air Force up to the German figure of 2,000, which in turn will entail a corresponding further increase by Germany and so on, ad infinitum. Indeed, the figures just given to us by the French seem to indicate the first move in this game, since they bear little relation to figures previously given to us.6: As I think my colleagues are. aware, I have long held the view that an agreed limitation in armaments could only be reached by direct negotiation between the Germans and ourselves. In the course of the Berlin Conversations Herr Hitler has announced his basis for parity quite plainly and unconditionally. On the other hand, General Goring, in the course of a conversation with Sir E. Phipps on the 3rd May (telegram No. 114, Saving, from Berlin), said that if he could be certain that Britain would be at his side in the event of a Russian attack, he would be content with a far smaller air force, and mentioned the figure of 1,000 first-line aircraft. It appears, therefore, that in fact Herr Hitler&apos;s demand for parity with France depends in some degree upon the situation vis-a-vis Russia. The conclusion of the recent Franco-Russian Agreement can only have the effect of hardening German determination to accept nothing less than that parity with France which Herr Hitler has already demanded.7. It would seem only too obvious that all the circumstances conspire to form a vicious circle, which if allowed to continue must inevitably prevent any agreement on stabilisation and limitation, unless bold action is taken by us at this juncture. All hope of reaching an understanding must depend on the destruction of this vicious circle, and the first step would appear to be to make use of the conversations that are already taking place between Sir E. Phipps and Herr Hitler with regard to the latter&apos;s recent speech, to convince the Germans that they are overestimating the present French strength and that the figure for agreement should be in the region of 1,500 first-line aircraft.8. Concurrently with this, we must persuade the French to agree, in view -of our own considerable expansion, to a parity level on the same basis. Ultimately it will be inevitable that similar discussions will have to be initiated with the Russians, in order to obtain from them some statement of their strength and policy.9. If, on the other hand, no such steps are taken, it will not be long before we shall have to consider a still further increase in our own metropolitan first-line strength beyond the figure of 1,500 now projected.
a10. Herr Ribbentrop, who is Herr Hitler&apos;s confidential adviser upon matters connected with the Disarmament Conference, is, I understand, to visit London in the near future in connection with the projected naval talks. This seems to me to provide an opportunity for arranging a three-cornered conference with a French representative on the subject of the limitation of air armaments, and I suggest that our Ambassadors in Paris and Berlin should be instructed to sound their respective Governments as to the acceptability of an invitation to discussions of this kind in London. Hitherto discussions with Germany have followed discussions with the French, and Germany has resented this by repre-senting that she has always been presented with an agreement between England and France which she is invited to accept or to reject. It would be, I think, a very favourable point in favour of the move I am suggesting that in this case Germany should be represented from the very initiation of the discussion.-      L.Air Ministry, May 31, 1935.
