INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation, by the Government of India,,dated 15th June,  1935-Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential Appreciation of the Political Situation in India,   dated 15th June,  1935, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.Following appreciation is for the Dominions,  and is the sixth of the 1935 Series-1.      The early part of May was marked &quot;by joyful celebration of the Silver Jubilee and further reports. .corroborate the views expressed last month,  and show with what genuine feelings of loyalty that event was celebrated throughout the length and breadth of India.      The subscriptions to the Silver Jubilee Fund amount to over a crore of Rupees (approximately three-quarters of a million pounds) and this goes to show that the Princes and people of India are ready to give practical proof of their lo^ralty, and to contribute liberally to a fund designed to relieve human suffering.2.      The end of the month has been clouded by the catastrophic tragedy of the Quetta earthquake.      There were two saving features of the situation,  in the first place there was no damage to roads or railways,  and no .interruption of rail or road communications or of v/ater supjply.      In the second place,  and this was eve n more important,  a large military garrison was available with ample supplies and equipment to render first-aid to the stricken city.      There is general appreciation,  especially among the sufferers themselves,  of the promptitude and efficiency with which the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief and his staff organised relief measures;    of the bravery and the cheerfulness with which troops, both British and. Indian,  carried out difficult and dangerous work of rescue and salvage;    of the relief afforded to those suffering from dangerous injuries by the
^ i. ^2.Medical Officer assisted by. voluntary workers,  and of the excellent transport arrangements made by the Railway Authorities.In spite of this,  there has been in some sections of the press carping criticism of the measures adopted and,   in particular,  of the decision not to allow voluntary relief parties to go to Quetta,  while wholly false rumours have been circulated tending   t$ discredit the work of the troops and suggesting that they might have done more to save human life or property.      This attitude of a considerable section of the Indian press has caused no surprise to whose who know how low are its standards of journalistic honesty and how completely unscrupulous are its methods.      One rumour that became widely current was that the Government,  regardless of all humanitarian considerations,  intended to &quot;blow up or burn the. city.Though a tragedy of this magnitude sets on edge the nerves of the survivors and inevitably gives rise to alarmist rumours,  there is no doubt that certain sections of the Press are deliberately frying to make political capital out of the disaster.      They are indignant that Congress has not been given an opportunity of advertising itself in the striken areas,  and overlook entirely the cogent reasons which forced Government to.reduce the population of Quetta to a minimum,   to evacuate all   , survivors as speedilj^ as possible,  and to carry out all relief measures in the area itself through Military agencies.      It will be remembered that for the relief of Bihar,  the Congress President raised a Fund of over 28 lakhs of Rupees.      No final accounts of this Fund have Been published,&quot;but an account published in September showed they had spent less than half of this Fund,  tiiough there
had heen some lavish expenditure on &quot;staff and equipment and that they still had in hand a balance of about 15 lakhs of Rupees.Whether this balance has yet been spent or not is uncertain, hut some Nationalist papers sought to increase Congress prestige by long and exaggerated accounts of the efficiency of their relief operations and,  as on the present occasion,  showed a disposition to misrepresent the measures adopted by official agencies and to make political capital out of the situation.      The experience gained in the case of Bihar showed how difficult it is for a political party,  even though some of its leaders are honest, to utilise large sums of money for relief measures,  or to organise such measures with any degree of efficiency.3*     Apart from the earthquake,  the month has been devoid of incident;    there is still a good deal of wrangling in Congress circles as to whether they should accept office or not under the new constitution, and opinions on this point are still sharply divided.      The. attempt made to stir up sympathy and to collect funds for detenus in Bengal,  though widespread, met with little public support.      In Bengal itself it became necessary to prohibit publication in the press of accounts of meetings on &quot;Detenu day&quot;, a measure the justification of which-will he appreciated if it is remembered that,  in the past, expressions of sympathy with the terrorists against whom action has had to be taken under the law, have been an important factor in keeping alive the terrorist mentality and in causing revivals of the movement..
