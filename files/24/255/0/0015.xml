The Ministerial Defence Requirements Committee have had the subject under consideration at two meetings and submit to the Cabinet a Reporb* by a Sub-Committee on Air Parity which they set up on the 30th April, 1935, under the Chairmanship of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.3. The Ministerial Committee are impressed by the serious delay involved in the production of Heavy and Medium Bombers, and have instructed their Sub-Committee to examine the programme of production of such bombers in further detail with a view to the acceleration of the most modern types.4. On the question of the recruitment of the necessary personnel for the programme of expansion, the Ministerial Committee have invited the Air Ministry to consult, in the first instance, the Treasury and the Ministry of Labour.5. It was represented to the Committee, during their discussion, that it was undesirable, if it could be avoided, to quote definite figures in public for our proposed programme, at any rate until we are quite sure of our ground, or to give a numerical estimate of the future German Air Force. In this connection it was suggested that an agreed form of words should be drawn up for use by Government spokesmen in the forthcoming debate.6. The investigation has brought out very clearly the need for increased financial provision for Secret Service funds. The Committee are of the opinion; however, that a supplementary estimate for the purpose is most undesirable and have requested the Foreign Office and the Treasury to consult together with a view to finding some other means of provision.7.   The Committee agreed &apos;c To recommend to the Cabinet that the Air Ministry should be authorised to proceed with the programme so far as it referred to fighter and light bomber aircraft, subject to the normal financial procedure between the Air Ministrv and the Treasury.&quot;(Initialled) J.

MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE ON DEFENCE REQUIREMENTS.Interim Report by the Sub-Committee on Air Parity.Part I. General. &apos; &apos;AT their 61st Meeting on the 30th April, 1935, the Ministerial Committee on Defence Requirements appointed a Sub-Committee composed of : The Secretary of State for the Colonies (Chairman), The President of the Board of Trade, The First Commissioner of Works,with the following terms of reference : -&quot; In consultation with representatives of the Air Ministry to recommend what steps should be taken .... to. implement the policy stated in the House by the Lord President, that in air strength and in air power this Country should not be inferior to any Country within striking distance.&quot;2. In accordance with the above instructions we have held two meetings and had a very full discussion on the points at issue. The Report which we now &quot;forward is of an Interim nature. The issues involved are large and complicated, and although we realise that the Government will wish to be presented as soon as possible with the outline of a suggested programme designed to meet the situation so far as it is known at present, it will be appreciated that much work will have to be done on detailed questions. It may be necessary for that reason, and also because the present situation is fluid, to present a further report at a later date.Part II. The Present Position.3. From information available last year in the Air Ministry it was estimated that the first stage of German air expansion would be completed by October 1935, although the scope of that stage was in some doubt. It was thought that their provision for this period would probably be a total of 1,700 aircraft for military purposes which would allow after training and reserve aircraft had been deducted, for a first-line strength of some 50 squadrons, or 600 first-line aircraft. Herr Hitler has now stated that Germany possesses 800-850 first-line aircraft or sufficient to equip 70 squadrons. To what extent these aircraft have, in point of fact, been organised into squadrons is still a matter of speculation. From information available at the Air Ministry, it seems that 12 squadrons may have been so formed. Although any deduction is necessarily speculative it is thought that if any large increase over the figure of 12 squadrons had actually taken place, indications of the fact would have been received, and that is not the case. It may well be that aircraft to the number of 850 have been constructed and grouped together and the personnel ear-marked for them, but that is a different thing from the constitution of a fully organised Air Force with an efficient ground organisation.4. It is to be remembered that neither Herr Hitler nor General Goering are in the least likely to minimise their position. Both on grounds of internal politics and external affairs they have every reason to exaggerate.5. Of the total of 1,425 service aircraft which, according to the Air Ministry&apos;s information, Germany possessed at the end of last month, it is probable that some 400 are employed in training schools. From the professional point of view it would be unsound to allot as. much as 850 of the remainder to squadrons .and to keep only 125 in reserve, but it is quite possible that the Germans have actually taken this step, counting on later output (which is estimated at present at approximately 200 aircraft per month of all kinds) for the necessary reserves.6. The Air Ministry are taking all steps within their power to arrive at accurate information, but we are of the opinion that we must accept, as a basis of comparison, the figure of 800-850 quoted by Herr Hitler, as the probable.
strength of the German First-line Air Force to-day. It is very improbable that these aircraft and the necessary personnel are so completely formed and organised as are our ^existing squadrons, and their standard of training cannot be as high as our own, yet these are imponderable factors which, although greatly to our advantage, cannot be produced in defence of a programme numerically less than German strength.7. On the important question of intelligence referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Air Ministry have informed us that a larger provision of money will be required for the purpose of its collection, failing which it will be difficult to acquire information in any increased degree. We are of the opinion that enlarged provision should be made for this highly necessary purpose.8. We have considered carefully what aircraft we are fairly entitled to count as against the German first-line strength. We have come to the conclusion that we must exclude not only squadrons stationed overseas, but also the whole of the Fleet Air Arm, and include only Regular and Non-Regular Squadrons stationed in this country. This question is fully dealt with in Part III of this Report. On this basis our own strength in the Home Defence Air Force at the present time is 453 aircraft in Regular Squadrons, plus 127 aircraft of non-regular units, a total of 580. In addition we hold aircraft in peace reserve in England both for home squadrons, and partly for overseas squadrons, of about 100 per cent. There are also a number of training aircraft and reserves for such. Our total military aircraft all over the world, including reserves and the Fleet air arm, amounts to about 2,500, and of elementary training types, some 700. This question of reserves is one of the greatest importance and there is no doubt that as compared with Germany the comparative situation does not cause anxiety, though provision of war reserves has not yet started (vide CP. 85 (35) paragraph 20). We are of opinion that we should refuse on grounds of public policy to state numbers of reserves, but as the question of reserves will almost certainly be raised, the Government would be justified in saying that our comparative position as regards reserves of aircraft is not such as to cause anxiety.9. As regards first-line aircraft, it is to be noted that our present force of 580 regular and non-regular aircraft reveals a deficiency of 270, as compared with the accepted figure of 850 German first-line aircraft. For the reasons given in previous paragraphs we believe that our squadrons are at present in fighting value definitely superior to those of Germany, but the numerical disparity cannot be allowed to continue if parity is to be judged, as we think it must, by a comparison of existing strengths.10. It is necessary in making the above comparisons, to refer to the possible use by Germany of aircraft of civil types for military purposes. From an examination of the available information on the subject it would appear that whilst Germany possesses some 600 civil aircraft of over 200 h.p., it is unlikely that more than 200 of these would be suitable for conversion for military purposes.11. In this connexion it is also necessary to consider the position of German civil pilots available. Our information leads us to believe that Germany possesses about 1,100 trained military pilots and 4,000 other pilots. Only a very small percentage of the latter could be regarded as efficient for military purposes unless subjected to a full course of military training.12. Our own position is, we believe, in this respect superior, in spite of public statements to the contrary. The total of Regular Air Force Pilots up to and including the rank of Wing Commander amount to 2,700. There are, in addition, 1,100 pilots now in the Reserve. Behind these there are some 300 ex-Air Force pilots, and a further 1,300 civil pilots would be available in war, but only after receiving full military training.13. In defining what we mean by &quot;parity,&quot; we considered that the first point on which must arrive at a decision was whether we should be justified in excluding any German military aircraft from the Force against which we mustPart III. -The Definition of Parity.[11566]b 2
build. It is no doubt true, for example, that, as Germany has a much larger army than our own, she requires a larger number of army co-operation aircraft. The contention has also been advanced that the really important consideration is the number of bombing aircraft which Germany could employ against this country. We are convinced, however, that it would be impossible, in view of our categorical statements, to exclude from the German &quot; Parity Force &quot; any aircraft unless we had the most absolute and unanswerable reasons for doing so. In these circum-stances we are agreed that for purposes of calculation we must assume &quot; parity &quot; to mean numerical equality with the total German Air Force.14. We have suggested above that parity should be regarded in its numerical aspect in relation to first-line aircraft, but the definition of &apos;&apos; first-line aircraft&apos;&apos; in itself is not simple. In another connection, the following formula has been used for a first-line regular squadron :-&quot; A squadron containing aeroplanes and pilots properly organised andlocated in its station.&quot;It may well be that Herr Hitler is not working to such a definition, but we consider that so far as we are concerned, that definition should stand accepted.15. The Chief of the Air Staff has discussed with us the question of whether our non-Regular units should be included with our first-line units in these numerical comparisons. He states that the types of aircraft allotted to non-Regular squadrons are exactly the same as those used by Regular squadrons, and that the standard of training of the personnel is satisfactory. In view of the circumstances under which the German Air Force is being rapidly expanded and of the effect which such rapid expansion must necessarily have on their efficiency as fighting units, he is of the opinion that our non-Regular units can, at any rate for the next two years, be added to the Regular units for purposes of numerical comparison with Germany, and that in doing so we are but comparing like with like. We are prepared to support his view, and we recommend that it be accepted, subject to reconsideration in 1937.1.6. As regards the Fleet Air Arm, the Chief of the Air Staff urged that Fleet Air Arm aircraft stationed in Home waters, or ashore, should not be included in our comparison. It was pointed out, with much cogency, that if it became known, as it certainly would, that our Fleet Air Arm had been so included, and that the possibility existed of our Fleet being weakened by the removal of its Fleet Air Arm, the deterrent to aggressive action by Japan would be enormously reduced.17. Quite apart from the technical aspects of this matter, which were considered by the Defence Requirements Committee last year, we are in full agreement with this point of view, and consequently with the recommendation made by the Chiefs of Staff on this question in paragraph 5 of D.C. (M) (32) 137, in which they stated : &quot;There can be no idea of counting on the Fleet Air Arm aircraft, even though they may be stationed at home, as an integral part of the British Metropolitan first-line strength with its consequential effect of vitally impairing the fighting efficiency of the Fleet.&apos;&apos;18. To sum up, we are of the opinion that parity should be regarded on a numerical basis of first-line aircraft, including, in our own instance, non-Regular squadrons. The categories of aircraft to be considered in making a comparison should include bomber squadrons, fighter squadrons and the other categories mentioned in paragraph 11 of CP. 85 (35), (i.e.. General Purpose Squadrons, Army Co-Operation Squadrons and Reconnaissance Squadrons), but that we should not include the Fleet Air Arm.Part IV. Scale and Rate of German Expansion.19. It is not easy to ascertain the exact size of the air force to which Herr Hitler aspires. During the Berlin discussions the figure of 2,091 aircraft was shown on a diagram as the present French first-line strength, purporting to include the French Metropolitan air force and all colonial air forces. On the same occasion, however, Herr Hitler informed Sir John Simon that &quot; the parity which he demanded was parity with the forces in Metropolitan France, plus that in North Africa.&quot;-
Part V. Our Requirements for the Needs of Parity.A cceleration of Programme.27. It is clear that if we are to keep pace with German development an acceleration of programme is required, not only above that already approved, but also, above the proposals contained in CP. 85 (35). For the maintenance of the existing Air Force plus the equipment and maintenance pf the 12J new squadrons already approved for the financial year 1935-36, about 1,200 aircraft of service and training types are expected to be delivered during the current financial year. This will result under present arrangements in a nett increase at the end of the year of about 150 aircraft in first line, after making deductions for wastage, reserve and training aircraft.20. In point of fact the French air force, on the basis referred to in the preceding paragraph, amounts to 1,404 first-line aircraft. It is not clear whence the figure of 2,091 arises, but it is almost certainly due to German miscalculation and indeed it is an exaggerated statement even if all French colonial forces are included. The probability that a miscalculation was made is enhanced by the fact that similar exaggeration of air strength was made in respect of Powers other than France.21. After consideration of all the factors, we are of the opinion that the proper basis to adopt as an estimate of the German future programme is the total of the French Metropolitan and North A african air forces at any particular time, which was, indeed, the basis Herr Hitler claimed, although he inaccurately stated its totals.22. We must observe that the figure of 1,404 is based on information received by the Air Ministry in confidence from the French and cannot be quoted in public.23. The Air Ministry in their preparation of CP. 85 (35) had in mind this distinctly complicated question of the probable scale of future German development, and from a consideration of all the factors involved, they arrived at the conclusion that Germany&apos;s aim was to establish, by the 1st April, 1937, a first-line strength of 1,512 aircraft, which, it will be noted, is a figure comparable with the actual French position. We think we are justified in accepting this estimate. We consider that it is not safe to assume that the German programme up to the 1st April, 1937, is less than 1,500 first-line aircraft, and we also consider that the figure put forward by the Air Ministry -1,512 (or, say, 1,500), should be accepted as the basis of our own preparations and for the purposes of publicity, if necessary.24. As regards the date of completion of the German programme, the Air Ministry estimate is that they can reach a first-line figure of 1,512 by the 1st April, 1937, and their estimate takes into account the capacity of German output as it exists to-day and as it is likely to develop within the next two years. There is no doubt that an expansion on this scale is well within German factory capacity. While, therefore, we accept the figure of 1,512 as a reasonable estimate of intention, the position will have to be carefully watched.25. Comment has been made that after the 1st April, 1937, no increase has been attributed to the German first-line strength. The reason for this is that at that date Germany will have reached approximate parity with the French Metro-politan and North African forces, and in the absence of evidence that she intends to expand beyond those figures, there is no present reason to believe that she will -do so. This is, however, a matter which must be constantly reviewed, and the question whether any agreement can be made whereby the air forces of the three Powers concerned can be kept to this figure, or reduced to some lesser figure, will no doubt receive the attention of the Government.26. So far as we are immediately concerned, whatever the future may hold, we should state that Herr Hitler&apos;s claim being parity with the French Metropolitan and North African Air Forces, we must be equal to that total, and that a reasonable estimate of this figure is approximately 1,500 first-line aircraft. The means by which we can attain this parity is discussed below.
; 28. On the existing programme as already approved a similar provision for the delivery of about 1,200 aircraft during the financial year 1936-37 would have to be made, thus requiring a total delivery of about 2,400 aircraft over the two years. But if we are to aim at a first-line strength of 1,500 aircraft by April 1937, we will require an output from the industry of a further 1,400 aircraft over and above the 2,400 required for the existing approved programme, i.e., a grand total output from the industry of 3,800 aircraft between now and the 31st March, 1937.29. The Air Ministry point out that whatever programme of expansion be authorised, their main activity during the first year would necessarily be in the rforms of recruiting and training. The delivery of aircraft cannot mature until a considerable time after orders have been placed and, therefore, of the total aircraft now to be ordered, the majority will be delivered towards the end of the period now under consideration. We feel we should call attention to this point because it may well be that, on paper, in April 1936, the relative numerical position will be even more unfavourable than it is at the present time. This appears to be unavoidable. The Germans have been taking secret measures for the training of personnel and the reorganisation of their aircraft industry over the past few years and to that extent they have got a start on us. Not until the fruits of intensive training measures and an increased output from the aircraft industry are both available can the position be put right.Types of Aircraft and their Replacement.30. The figure of 3,800 includes not only aircraft for newly forming squadrons and training establishments, but provides also for a certain measure of replacement of existing types by new aircraft and a reserve for the maintenance of existing and new squadrons, &amp;c. Orders for that number will be for aircraft of types as efficient as can be made available in sufficient numbers within the specified period, having regard to our present-day state of development. It will be realised, however, that an air force is always &quot; obsolescent&quot; in the sense that aircraft in service use are in performance necessarily behind those of new types which are just entering the design and experimental stages.31. The performance of our own aircraft compared with those of certain other Powers is given in Appendix A of this Report. It is for the types of aircraft now in production that orders will be given during during the initial stages of the expansion programme. In relation to Germany, the present position may be summed up as follows  Heavy Bombers. The German 3-engined Heavy Bomber is ahead of ours in speed, range and load.Medium Bombers. Our existing types are not sufficiently good to put into production and steps are in hand for new types (see below).Light Bombers. There is no German type on which we have sufficient information to warrant a comparison.Fighters. Our fighter aircraft have a marked superiority in speed.32. At the present time, operating from England, our Heavy Bombers can reach German territory, including the Ruhr, but cannot reach Berlin with a full normal load of bombs. To enable our Light Bombers to be effective against German territory, it would be necessary that they should operate from bases on the Continent. On the other hand, German Heavy Bombers can reach a large part of England, including, of course, London, from German territory without violating Belgian or Dutch neutrality. Appendix B is a map showing ranges of main objectives in Germany from England and from Northern France.33. As regards future types, orders have already been given for prototype aircraft of all the above categories, Heavy, Medium and Light Bombers, and Fighters. The extent to which these can be accelerated is at present under investigation, but in any event production deliveries in quantity are unlikely to be made before 1937.Factory Capacity.: 34. In the view of the Air Ministry, it is within the capacity of our existing aircraft industry to produce, by April 1937, the total of 3,800 aircraft referred to, and they are of opinion that it can be done without the adoption of special steps
by His Majesty&apos;s Government for the reorganisation of industry. It will be necessary for the industry to expand if it is to take advantage of outside Orders which are certain to accrue. The need for acceleration in the production of new-types of aircraft will, however, necessitate giving more latitude to the industry ih the interpretation of their specification requirements, and a more strict limitation of subsequent alteration and modification to the essentials of operational and safety requirements than is practised in normal times. The Air Ministry inform us that in the preparation of the latest designs their specification requirements to manufacturers have been greatly simplified.35. The Air Ministry have emphasised very strongly that if production on the above scale is to be carried out, it is essential for them to place orders at once with the trade, in order to ensure early delivery. It would be necessary for them to have authority to take this step, since it involves arrangements which go beyond the current financial year.36. In normal circumstances the Air Ministry cannot place contracts until the Annual Estimates have been approved. The aircraft industry is unable to order supplies of raw material and organise the production of aircraft and engines without contracts from the Department defining the numbers and types required. A time-lag is thus introduced which could be avoided if the Air Ministry were authorised to announce their annual requirements in advance. To provide for a balanced output, firms should be in a position to commence deliveries on their annual programme as soon as deliveries on the programme for the previous year have been completed. If this time-lag be not eliminated there is every likelihood that there will be a considerable deficiency by April 1937 due to the failure of aircraft firms to complete their contracts within the time available.37. The Committee are strongly of the opinion that in the special circumstances the difficulties which normally arise each year in&apos; getting contracts placed in sufficient time for them to be completed must be overcome by the authority which the Air Ministry require and by the co-operation of all Depart-ments concerned. It is essential that if the full production of aircraft and equipment is to be obtained within the specified time, the orders to industry ;shall be given without delay.38. A general estimate has been made by the Air Ministry, but not yet confirmed with the Trade, of the probable delivery of aircraft, under the ^suggested programme, as follows :  Financial year. Approximate1935-36- output.First half Second half 1936-37-First half Second half500 1,1001,100 1,1003,800Effect on Civil and Foreign Orders.39. We have had under consideration the effect which the placing of so large an order for military aircraft would have on the capacity of the industry to meet requirements of civil aircraft and foreign orders. As regards the former, it is not considered that demands for civil aircraft are sufficiently large to cause any appreciable delay in the completion of the military production programme, except that there may well be some difficulty in reconciling with the greatly increased Royal Air Force programme the aircraft requirements of Imperial Airways for giving effect to the Empire Air Mail Scheme recently approved. As regards foreign orders, these are practically all for military aircraft, and We are of the opinion that an increase in foreign orders, rather than a decrease, may be expected as a result of the more flourishing condition of the aircraft industry as a whole. It must be emphasised, however, that the execution of the increased Royal Air Force orders will, during the next two years, absorb the complete capacity of the existing aircraft industry.
40. In our view the large increase in Royal Air Force orders which would result from the course we propose above, together with the probable large increase in foreign orders for British military aircraft, will afford an opportunity to expand and encourage the aircraft industry, and we are strongly of the opinion that so great an opportunity should not be missed. It will have the additional and extremely valuable advantage of increasing our war potentiality, so that if we are faced in the next few years with an emergency, our aircraft production may be the more readily mobilised. With these ends in view, we feel that a strong appeal should be made to the firms concerned, not only to enlarge their factories, but in cases where strategical considerations demand such a course, they should be urged to open up new factories in suitable localities. Such a policy would have an advantageous repercussion on the labour market. 11 is suggested that a panel of Ministers could very usefully have a discussion with the leading aircraft manufacturers in order to represent the position.Personnel.41. Under the programme discussed above, i.e.. an increase of metropolitan first-line aircraft to 1,512, the formation of 49 squadrons, additional to the programme already authorised up to the 31st March, 1937, is required, involving a total addition of 71 squadrons to the existing Royal Air Force.42. The provision of personnel for so rapid an increase will be a matter of great difficulty. The current financial year&apos;s programme for the entry of pilots, for training already stands at the high figure of 530; it will have to be increased to 1,300 or 1,400. This scale of expansion cannot be dealt with by the normal training measures of the Royal Air Force, and special steps of a new kind will have to be undertaken.43. Although it has not yet been possible to work out in detail the proposed action, we are informed that the training of these extra pilot? will entail the creation of 5 new Service flying training schools and also the full use of civilian training schools which would have to be expanded from their present figure of 4 to probably 14. We are informed that this is a practicable measure provided funds are forthcoming.44. A scheme on the above lines has been considered in the Air Ministry for training in time of war, and they are of the opinion that it should be adequate to produce the required number of pilots if now put into effect. It will be necessary to employ a high proportion of N.C.O. pilots and there will be a large increase in the number of short-service commission officers. Some lowering in standard of efficiency will have to be accepted.45. The provision of the large number of fitters and other tradesmen required for the new squadrons is also a matter of great difficulty, and special steps will have to be taken in this connection. These steps will include getting men back who are on the Reserve or who have already passed through the Reserve by offering them adequate inducements. A very large recruiting programme will also be required, including the maximum available number of skilled and semi-skilled men from civil life. In this connection the co-operation of the Ministry of Labour will be essential and the Air Ministry are already in consultation with that Department. The total airmen and apprentices recruited in 1935 and 1936, skilled and unskilled, will be in the region of 17,000.46. The launching of recruiting measures for pilots and tradesmen on the scale indicated in paragraphs 42 to 45 above can only be successful if supported by vigorous publicity. The measures to be adopted to this end will require careful consideration, but it is suggested that the occasion of the forthcoming debate should be used to make an appeal for recruits.A aerodromes and Buildings.47. We are inform-med that, although the Air Ministry have not yet had time to examine in detail the question of the provision of new aerodromes and buildings, they are of the opinion that no insuperable difficulty should arise in this connection, subject to their being given authority to take the special steps mentioned below.    It may be, however, that for some time newly formed
ySquadrons will not be at their proper stations. Standards of comfort and aesthetic considerations will have to take second place, but it Was stated that a limiting factor might be the quick purchase of land.Immediate Steps by the Air Ministry.48. If the programme outlined above is approved and is to be given full effect, the following action should be taken immediately by the Air Ministry, and we strongly recommend that they be authorised to act at once : Equipment.(I) Place orders for aircraft, engines and equipment to cover the total expansion visualised.(2) Modify existing contracts for selected-prototype aircraft to provide for overtime and night shifts.(3) Secure priority over other departments as required with regard to available stocks of semi-manufactured parts of raw materials and also for ordering and holding such stocks if necessary.W orks.(4) Purchase and hire additional sites for aerodromes. (5) Erect temporary buildings on a considerable scale. (6) Purchase additional hangars.Personnel.(7) Expand the recruiting organisation to the extent required.(8) Formulate the conditions of service and emoluments of specially entered personnel and of personnel brought back to, or retained in, service. It may be necessary to ask Parliament to pass a supplementary Vote A, possibly before the summer recess, and in any case before the end of the calendar year.(9) Create the necessary additional Service training units and con-trolling organisations and enter into contracts with civil firms for the formation of the additional civil training schools.(10) Commence the formation of three additional Auxiliary Squadrons.Finance.(II) Dispense with competitive tendering where this would entail undue delay.Staff and Accommodation.(12) Engage additional staff and secure accommodation for them. The Air Ministry wish to urge strongly that the present dispersion of the Air Ministry among six different buildings in Kingsway (which is a source of constant difficulty and delay) should be remedied by the concentration of the staff in two buildings in this area.Part VI. Costs.49. The time available has not permitted the construction of detailed estimates of cost, and in any case the cost of a scheme of this magnitude, carried out under pressure, must be dependent on some unforseeable factors. The following figures, which have been supplied by the Air Ministry, shew, however, the general trend of the expenditure over the four-year period 1935-38, which would be involved in carrying out the programme :-Excess over 1935..    Present Net Air Votes (1935) ..       20,650,000Probable&apos;Supplementary for 1935 Air Votes 1936-37       &apos;    ...1937-38 ...1938-39 ...3,500,000 .    3,500,00034,000,000 13,350,00035,000,000 14,350,00033,000,000 12,350,000The normal annual maintenance cost of the R.A.F. as thus expanded would be in the order of  30,000,000 a figure which should be reached by 1940 or 1941. [11566] c

Practicability of Expansion beyond 1,512 First-Line Aircraft.51. We feel that the problem of a yet further increase of our Air Force arising from any repercussion which may result in Germany from our announce-ments of expansion, cannot be entirely divorced from the existing problem. We have therefore examined the possibilities of a further expansion by an additional 500 first-line aircraft over and above the figure of 1,512 already recommended.52. We are informed that it is not practicable to complete such an additional increase before the 1st April, 1938. If in April 1937 an immediate increase were necessary, it could only be met by what may be termed a Temporary Mobilisation Scheme, under which Training Establishments are reorganised and converted into first-line units on the outbreak of war and made up by the introduction of Reserves. This policy is to be deprecated in that it can only be regarded as &quot; window dressing,&quot; since it would destroy our ability to develop our training facilities to the full on the outbreak of war.Part VIII. Summary. 53.   Our main conclusions are as follows : (a) The present position is that, on a numerical basis, we are inferior toGermany to the extent of 270 first-line aircraft, but in view of the fact that we have reason to believe we have larger reserves, our superiority in training organisation and our greater number of fully qualified pilots, the position need not cause present anxiety (paragraphs 3 to 12).(b) For purposes of calculation we must assume parity to mean numericalequality with the German Air Force (paragraph 13).(c) We should therefore include all German first-line aircraft (not onlybombing aircraft) and, on our side, all Regular and non-Regular squadrons stationed at Home, but excluding the Fleet Air Arm \   (paragraphs 15 to 18).(d) The size of the future German Air Force, in the absence of information to the contrary, should be taken as the sum of the French Metropolitan and North African air forces at any particular time, which is the basis Herr Hitler has claimed (paragraph 19).(?) The accurate figure, on that basis, is to-day 1,404 first-line aircraft. This figure has been given to us in confidence by the French and cannot be quoted. The future German total assumed by the Air Ministry is a fighting strength of 1,512 first-line aircraft; we endorse this assumption (paragraphs 20 to 23).(/) We must assume that the German Air Force will reach the figure of 1,512 first-line aircraft by the 1st April, 1937, this is within her manufacturing capacity. To achieve parity we must adopt a corresponding programme (paragraphs 24 to 26).(g) In order to reach a first-line strength of 1,512 it will be&apos; necessary to place orders for 3,800 aircraft for delivery by April 1937. Of this number 2,400 are covered by the programme of Air Force expansion already approved by the Government (paragraphs 27 and 28).
(h) It is within the capacity lof our aircraft industry to produce 3,800aircraft by April 1937. In order to do so no special steps for reorganisation of the industry will be required, but it will be necessary for it to expand if it is to take advantage of increasing outside orders-(paragraphs 34-36).(i) The&apos;Air Ministry have emphasised that the necessary output can beachieved only if authority is given to them to place orders at once with the trade for the whole programme. We regard this as extremely important (paragraph 37).(j) In order to encourage the firms concerned, we suggest that their repre-sentatives might be invited to meet a panel of Ministers, who would explain to them the position and ask for their co-operation, both in the national and in their own interests. It is of great importance that the industry should be able to cope with foreign and civil orders as well as with our Service requirements. Any expansion they can undertake would be a valuable increase towards our war potentiality and constitute a reserve of production in case German expansion exceeds our present estimate (paragraphs 39, 40).(k) A programme on the scale suggested involves the addition of 71 squadrons to the existing Royal Air Force. Provision of the necessary personnel, especially pilots (1,300-1,400), and tradesmen, under a voluntary system is a matter of extreme difficulty which can only be overcome by most strenuous efforts in recruiting. As soon as the Air Ministry have concerted their recruiting plans, in close consultation with the Ministry of Labour as regards skilled personnel, every support possible should be given to the Ministry in making their recruiting campaign effective (paragraphs 41-46).(Z) No insuperable difficulty should arise in the provision of aerodromes and buildings (paragraph 47).(m) If the programme is approved, certain immediate steps will have to be-taken by the Air Ministry (paragraph 48).(n) The position after April 1937, at which time we should achieve numerical parity on this suggested programme, cannot now be estimated. If Herr Hitler holds to his word, he will not, failing French expansion, increase his air force (paragraphs 25 and 26). Our own position is that 1,512 first-line aircraft represents our maximum achievement by that date; a further increase to a total of some 2,000 first-line aircraft could be carried out by April, 1938 (paragraphs 51 and 52).(o) The financial implications of the programme are :  falling to a normal figure of about  30,000,000 by 1940 or 1941 (paragraphs 49, 50).(p) One of the greatest difficulties with which we are faced is the lack of accurate information. It is vital that we should have the best possible information, now and in the future, and we recommend that there should be increased funds for the purpose (paragraph 7).(q) There are two figures which, for different reasons, cannot be quoted in public : -(i) The present strength of 1,404 French aircraft, given to us in confidence. It can, however, be said that we have assumed the: figure of about 1,500 aircraft as the number to which Germany is working on her claim for parit)^ with France.[11566] c 2 Present Air Vote (1935) Supplementary for 193520,650,000 3,500,000 34,000,000 35,000,000 35,000,000Estimated Air Vote. 1936 Estimated Air Vote, 1937 Estimated Air Vote, 1938&quot;;.   - ----    -  --------------.-.----
(ii) The figure 3,800, our total needs in aircraft to reach an effective first-line strength of 1,512. That figure includes Reserves, of which no numerical indication should be given. It could be stated that the programme involves an increase up to an approximate figure of 1,500 first-line aircraft, based on a reasonable interpretation of Herr Hitler&apos;s statement, and that, in addition, the programme will provide for reserves to first-line aircraft, and for pilots and other personnel.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee :P.
