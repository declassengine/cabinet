THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.&apos;                                                      &apos;           iJ fj SECRET. Copy No...&quot;.....C A B I N E T .CP.  91 (35)IMPRISONMENT FOR NON-PAYMENT OP PINES. ETC. Memorandum &quot;by the Home Secretary.1.     I wish to bring before my colleagues the question of legislation to carry out certain recommendations made by the Departmental Committee which reported last year on the imprisonment by Courts of Summary Jurisdiction of persons who fail to pay fines, rates and sums due under Maintenance and Affiliation Orders.2 .     The imprisonments due to these defaults number about 20,000 a year,  or 38^ of the total number of imprisonments for all causes.      The Committee came to the conclusion that this number could be substantially reduced without weakening the powers of the Courts to enforce their orders, if certain amendments were made in the law .3.     There was a discussion of the Committee1s Report in the House of Lords on the 27th February last and all the speakers pressed for legislation.4.     There are amongst the Committee&apos;s recommendations certain proposals which are contentious.      One of their proposals is for an extension of the system by which rates on small property are paid by the owner and collected by him from the tenants with the rent.     This would be a matter for consideration by the Ministry of Health in connection with any amendment of the Rating Acts . There is also a recommendation that when a man who is in regular employment fails to pay under a Wife Maintenance or Affiliation Order, the Court should have power,  if it thinks fit, to order the employer to make deductions from his salary or wages and pay
the amount deducted to the Court.      To this proposal the Labour Party would, I understand,  feel bound to object because it involves the principle of the attachment of wages.5.     The other recommendations of the Committee, however, which involve alterations of the procedure of the Courts in dealing with defaulters are of a non-contentious character and appear to command general support.6 .     Many persons who have been fined and given time to pay or have &quot;been summoned for rates fail to make any representations to the Courts.     Frequently when a commitment order is issued the money is paid, &quot;but in other cases the money is not forth-coming and the defaulter is taken straight to prison.     Amongst the persons so imprisoned there are some who, if they had made representations to the Court, might have been given further time to pay or in rate cases might have been excused in whole or in part.      In order to enable the Courts to have a &quot;better opportunity of considering such cases the Committee recommend that the Courts should he empowered, instead of issuing a warrant of commitment against such defaulters,  to issue a warrant for their arrest and production before the Court.     In many cases the issue of such a warrant will result, as does the issue of a commitment warrant, in the payment of the money;    in the residue of cases the Court will have an opportunity of examining the defaulter before deciding whether they will commit him to prison.7 .     The Committee also make proposals for enabling Courts in suitable cases to place under supervision defaulters ordered to pay fines by instalments, for requiring the Courts in Maintenance and Affiliation Order cases and in rate cases to satisfy themselves before committing the defaulter to prison that his default is due to wilful refusal or culpable neglect,
3rd May,  1935.for facilitating the variation of Maintenance and Affiliation Orders in cases where the defendant&apos;s circumstances alter, and . for facilitating the enforcement of such Orders in cases where-a defendant moves from the district of the Court which made the Order to the district of some distant Court.8.      I shall be glad if the Cabinet will authorise me to submit to the Home Affairs Committee a draft Bill dealing with these non-contentious matters.      I contemplate that the Bill should be introduced in the House of Lords, and if, as I anticipate, it passes that House without difficulty, the question can be considered later whether an opportunity can be found for the House of Commons to deal with it towards the end of the Session.J.G.
