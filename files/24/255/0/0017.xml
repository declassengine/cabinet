IS. THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT ANN IG. MAJESTY&apos; S.....GOVERNMENT.SECRET. Go^xil9.r_____________SBC. P.  102 (35) . CABINET.WEIGHTS AND MEASURES BILL. (Saiid and ballast and bottles) .Memorandum by the Prejsijient of the Board of^Trade.On 24th October,  1934 the Cabinet on the recommendation of the Home Affairs Committee (H.A.C.  18th Conclusions (34))   agreed to the inclusion of a Bill to amend the Weights and Measures Acts (in order to deal with the measurement of sand and ballast)  in the category of important Bills to be introduced if time permits. After consultation with the various interests concerned,  a Bill has now been drafted to deal with this matter,  and also with the use of bottles as measures - a growing practice.The provisions dealing with sand and ballast have been drafted to meet serious complaints over a long pe3riod, which the Board, of Trade have received,  and have,  by enquiry,  confirmed,  of the giving of short measure and other fraudulent practices in the sale and conveyance of sand, ballast and similar materials. As the law stands,  there is no power to deal with these abuses. All the interests concerned warmly support the proposals,  and an influential deputation &quot;^representing the organisations of producers,  carriers,  and users of these materials and tho Trades Union concerned has recently asked us to treat the matter as urgent,  and has promised support from Members on all sides of the House.The Bill also deals with a difficulty which arises from the growing use of bottles as measures.      Milk in particular,  and certain other commodities such as lubricating oil,   arc commonly
sold in bottles which are in effect     used as measures. Each of these bottles should,   as the law stands,be verified and stamped by an inspector of weights and measures.    That would be an elaborate and very costly process, if not impracticable.    Even though there is no guarantee that under present arrangements the  consumer is getting proper measure, the local authorities have refrained from enforcing the law on the understanding that legislation would be introduced to regulate the position.    But any local authority may at any time enforce the law and this would undoubtedly lead to local,   and perhaps general,  confusion so far as the milk trade was concerned.    The Bill provides  that,  subject to suitable safeguards, bottles may be stamped by licensed manufacturers instead    of by inspectors of weights and measures,whose duty it will be to test samples of bottles so stamped.    This  should ensure that the consumer is not defrauded,   and the addition to the cost of bottles should be negligible.    The proposals contained in the Bill are supported by the majority of local authorities and by the Glass Manufacturers Federation^   representing the bottle makers;    opinion among dairymen is divided.I ask for authority to submit the Bill to the Home Affairs Committee, with a view to obtaining my colleagues&apos; approval of the introduction of the Bill so that - if practicable - it may be passed into law this Session.    The Bill is,  I think,  suitable for introduction in the House of Lords.Boa rd o f&quot; Trade,16th May,   1955.
