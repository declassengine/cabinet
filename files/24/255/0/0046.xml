THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted, for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   June 1935.SECEET. Copy No.1176-B.(Also Paper No. C.O.S. 381.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.PROPOSED AERIAL CONVENTION:  POSSIBLE INCLUSION of holland.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.THE Foreign Office have raised with the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee the question of the possible inclusion of Holland in the proposed Aerial Convention. An extract from a letter from the Foreign Office, enclosing a Memorandum and annexures, is attached as Appendix A to this Report. The opinion of the Chiefs of Staff is desired as to whether or not the inclusion of Holland in the Convention would represent any new security for this country.2. In stating our views on this question, we would call attention to the fact that in May 1934 we drew up a Report (Paper No. C.O.S. 339) on the importance of Holland in Imperial Defence. That Report dealt with the relative importance to us of the maintenance of the integrity of Holland in comparison with Belgium, the likelihood of Germany attempting to over-run Holland, the scale of air attacks which Germany might develop from that country, and the means by which we might effectively intervene. Much of the ground which we then covered is applicable to the question now under consideration, and the views we then expressed remain unaltered. The only new factor in the situation during the last year is that we have information that Germany is taking steps to improve her system of inland waterways and to increase the capacity of her Baltic ports. The effect of this will be to make her less dependent on Dutch ports than she was in 1914, and the importance of the neutrality of Holland in a future war will, from her point of view, be correspondingly reduced.3. Apart from that new factor, which is not operative at the present time, the position to-day is the same as when we reviewed it last year. Although the strategical circumstances outlined in our previous Report still hold good, yet the question which is now put to us is a specific one, requiring the balancing up of the advantages and disadvantages of the possible inclusion of Holland in the proposed Convention.// Holland is not included in the Convention.4. We dealt in our previous Report with the likelihood, or otherwise, of Germany attempting to over-run Holland in the event of war in Western Europe. Apart from the possible occupation of part of Dutch territory by German Forces, there is to be considered the question of a violation of Dutch neutrality by German aircraft. In order to avoid, in attacks on Great Britain, the necessity of a long oversea flight from north-west Germany, German aircraft might fly over Dutch territory, probably at a great height or under cover of darkness. This would constitute a violation of Dutch neutrality, but it is quite possible that the Dutch would not be able to establish the facts or would otherwise regard it as sufficient [11747] b
cause for them to enter the war, and they would not be in a position effectively to interfere with these aircraft (even if they wished to do so) with their present resources.5. During 1914-18 the possibility of Germany. violating Dutch neutrality was always an anxiety. If in a future war she failed to over-run Belgium and a strong anti-aircraft defence was built up in that country and Northern France, the temptation to violate Dutch neutrality would be the greater.6. The present strength of the Dutch Forces and the condition of their defences are not such as to offer any prospect of their being able to defend their Eastern provinces. If the Dutch are not included in the Convention, the Dutch defensive position will, presumably, remain much as it is to-day, and if the Germans decide that the occupation of part of the Dutch territory, more especially their Eastern provinces, is necessary for the strategical success of the campaign against the French, Belgians and ourselves, it can be assumed they can over-run those provinces with very little difficulty, for they would have the advantage of the initiative, and allied assistance could not be given in time to prevent it.// Holland is included in the Convention.7. The inclusion of Holland in the Air Convention would inevitably bring them into a war in which Germany was fighting the Western Powers, and Germany would have every reason and excuse for the occupation of Dutch territory. Although the Convention is theoretically limited to the use of Air Forces, in the event of air aggression, yet it is quite certain that once an aggression has taken place, and air forces are used, Naval and Military Forces will also immediately be employed. Holland, in effect, would become a full member of Locarno, and it seems doubtful whether the Dutch themselves realise all that is implied by adherence to the Air Convention. The Dutch contribution towards the strength of the Western Powers is likely, in any event, to be small, and the adherence of a weak ally, situated in an area of geographical importance, is undoubtedly an additional commitment which would add to our liabilities rather than to our resources.8. There are, however, certain advantages, admittedly problematical, which would accrue by the inclusion of Holland in the Air Convention. We, should be enabled to bring pressure to bear on them to improve their defences, and it should be possible to get the Dutch and the Belgians to organise a zone of anti-aircraft defence which would constitute, in effect, ah outer zone of defence against air raids on England, and if such.a zone were organised we could, circumstances permitting, send a number of fighter squadrons to co-operate, provided always the Dutch could give them adequate protection.9. Another advantage, particularly from the Air aspect, would be that the inclusion of Holland would put an end to what would otherwise be a very uncertain situation. Instead of her being placed in a position where she would be unable or unwilling to maintain her neutrality in the face of belligerent aircraft flying over her territory (as explained in paragraph 4), she would be enabled, in co-operation with allies, to organise defensive measures from the outset. Not only could our own defensive plans be framed accordingly, but we should be able to fly directly over Holland to objectives in Germany, and thus obtain advantages which otherwise would accrue only to a less scrupulous enemy.Effective Neutrality.10. The inclusion of Holland in the Air Convention would, of course, extend that Convention beyond its originally intended scope, and there have been public statements to the effect that the Air Convention is not to be considered as an extension of Locarno.* If for that reason, or on account of the strategical con-siderations we have outlined above, it is considered that the Convention should not include Holland, we wish to emphasise the importance. of the neutrality of Holland in a war in Western Europe.     We have no doubt that the effective* E.g. : &quot;it is of the essence of the matter that the Pact should be between the Locarno Powers and in the nature of a precision. I will not say an addition to but a greater precision-  of the obligations of Locarno.&quot;   (Sir John Simon, House of Commons, May 31, 1935.)
neutrality of Holland in time of war is of the highest importance to us. To be fully effective, that neutrality must include the prohibition to German aircraft of flying over Holland to attack us. As suggested in paragraph 4 above, it is far from certain that Germany would respect Dutch neutrality in that respect, and doubtful whether the Dutch themselves would do more than protest against its occurrence. We have, therefore, considered whether it would be possible to do anything towards strengthening Holland&apos;s neutral position. For instance, it might be considered whether, whilst the Air Convention was being negotiated with Germany, there could be introduced as a connected subject an agreement for the absolute neutrality of Holland. The value of such an agreement would, like so many other matters, depend ultimately on the amount of reliance we can place on Germany&apos;s word.11. It may be that Germany now realises the extent to which she lost the sympathy of a great part of the world in 1914, when she yiolated her agreements regarding Belgium, and if she takes that lesson to heart it is conceivable that she would keep her word with regard to a neutrality agreement respecting Holland. We are not in a position to judge whether reliance can be placed on Germany&apos;s word, but we forward the suggestion for consideration.Summary.12.   Our views may be summarised as follows :  We stand to gain most by the effective neutrality of Holland. At present there is a chance, though not a very good one, that Germany might prefer to leave Holland neutral. If, on the other hand, Holland is to be a party to the Air Pact, all chance of neutrality is removed.13. We believe that the Dutch cannot maintain their neutrality to the extent that foreign aircraft will not be able to fly over Holland. Consequently,, if Germany cannot be trusted to respect Dutch neutrality in full, the inclusion of Holland in the Air Convention has certain advantages which have&apos; had&apos; our&apos; consideration. It would put an end to uncertainty, and would give us good cause to bring pressure to bear on the Dutch to improve their defences. As it is unlikely, however, that the Dutch will make adequate preparations to defend themselves, these advantages are small. As Holland, in its present undefended condition, is merely a temptation, we should be unwise to encourage her to become a member of the Air Convention unless she undertakes to take every possible step for her own defence.14. If it be decided not to include, Holland in the Convention, then we put forward for consideration the possibility of inviting Germany, in connection perhaps with the negotiation of the Convention, to agree that the neutrality of Holland should be mutually guaranteed by the signatory Powers. Whether that is advisable depends on the degree of reliance that can be placed on Germany&apos;s word.(Signed) ERNLE CHATFIELD.A. A. MONTGOMERY-MASSINGBERD. E. L.

APPENDIX.C.O.S. 378. -----Proposed Aerial Convention :  Possible Inclusion of Holland.Extract from a Letter from Sir Robert Vansittart to Sir Maurice Hankey, datedMay 24, 1935..  tp&apos; , .   &apos;   tp .. tp .... wtpI ENCLOSE a memorandum on the possible inclusion of Holland in the proposed Air Convention.The Secretary of State would be very glad if this matter could be considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Chiefs of Staff with a view to obtaining an opinion as to whether or not the inclusion of Holland would represent any new security for this country.It seems essential to give consideration to this aspect of the question, whether or not the proposal is eventually to be pursued.-it jfc -a- -it- -it--71&quot; tp tp tp tp tpEnclosure.On a number of occasions during February last, unofficial approaches were made by the Netherlands Foreign Minister to our Minister at The Hague, and also in London, for the purpose of ascertaining the intentions of the Powers respecting the participation of Holland in the proposed Air Pact. An account of these approaches is given in the annex to this memorandum. For convenience of reference there is also annexed the draft of the proposed pact, which has been prepared in the Foreign Office as an indication of the lines which we would work on in any negotiations. Certain comments by the Air Ministry on this draft are also attached.2. Quite apart from the political aspect of the question thus raised by the Netherlands Government which will have to be considered separately it is essential that this question should be studied from the technical and strategic point of view. It is accordingly suggested that the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Chiefs of Staff should examine it from this angle with a view to ascertaining what, if any, new security or other advantage might be expected to accrue to the United Kingdom from the participation of the Netherlands in the proposed Air Pact. Once consideration has been given to this aspect of the question, the matter would then be ready for examination from other points of view.Foreign Office, May 21, 1935.Annex I to Enclosure.Memorandum summarising the Developments as regards the Possible Inclusionof Holland in the Air Convention.(Extract.)We learned from Sir H. Montgomery on the 5th February that the Dutch Foreign Minister had asked him &quot;what the intention was&quot; as regards&quot; other countries, particularly of course Holland,, in &quot; the case of the air pact coming into actual operation % &apos;&apos; Was it intended that the adherence of such Powers should not be precluded 1 What was envisaged if an attack via the air over Holland   took  place?

Annex II to Enclosure.Draft Air Convention (Provisional redraft of March 4).(On the assumption that the Convention is to be signed and ratified simultaneously with the other instruments forming the &quot; general settlement.&quot;)[List of Heads of States.]Having this day concluded .... [reference to the other instruments forming the &apos;&apos; general settlement &quot; ].Recognising that the use Avhich might be made of modern developments in the air might lead to sudden aggression by one country upon another.Desiring to contribute to the restoration of confidence and the prospects of peace among nations by taking steps with the object of ensuring among themselves additional security against unprovoked aggression in the form of sudden attacks frOm the air.Sir H. Montgomery further reported that the Het Vaderland, a paper of some importance, had stated that, if invited, it would be the duty and the national interest of Holland to adhere to the air pact.2. The Dutch Minister made an enquiry of Mr. Eden on the subject on the 8th February, and on the 9th February the Belgian Ambassador mentioned the matter to Sir R. Vansittart. He said that the Belgian Government had evidence that the Germans had plans of invading Holland in the event of war, and seemed to be anxious that, if the Dutch approached us in the matter, they should not be rebuffed. Both Mr. Eden and Sir R. Vansittart stated that the initiative in this matter must come from the Netherlands Government (i.e., presumably that the latter should formally enquire whether Holland could participate in the Air Convention or some similar arrangement).3. On the 11th February the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir H. Montgomery (see the latter&apos;s private letter of the 12th February) that, speaking personally, he did not see how the Netherlands could stand out of the proposed air arrangement if invited to come into it. It was generally presumed that sudden aggressive air action by Germany was the danger. Supposing Germany took such action against France, and the British air force, under the terms of the &quot; Air Locarno,&quot; attacked Germany in France&apos;s defence, the British might well fly over Holland in order to do so. In that case the Dutch, if not a party to the arrangement, would be bound to defend their neutrality against us a situation which would obviously be repugnant to them.4. On the 15th February Jonkheer de Graeff, speaking in the First Chamber of the States General at The Hague, said &quot; the question whether the Netherlands should also join this possible Convention is for the time being not a question for the Government. We have not been invited, which stands to reason, because the new Pact has been proposed as an extension of the existing Locarno Pact. And it is not possible at present to say whether we shall be invited or whether other Powers will be enabled in general to accede. Still less is it possible to say at present what our attitude will then have to be.&quot;5. On the 23rd February (see Brussels telegram No. 8*) the Netherlands Foreign Minister raised with the Belgian Minister at The Hague the difficulty of the situation which might arise should Holland, not being a party to the Air Pact, suffer violation of her territory by a Power acting under the Air Pact against a Power which had been guilty of the first unprovoked aggression. He also spoke of the possibility of the establishment of a system of &quot; territorial air,&quot; i.e., vertical territorial limit to Dutch neutrality, above which passage by air would be free. Sir E. Ovey reported that the Belgian Government would like to hear the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government on this point. This was communi-cated to him in Foreign Office telegram to Brussels No. 18* of the 2nd March.Foreign Office, May 17, 1935.
Anxious, in particular, to safeguard the civil populations of their countries against the danger of indiscriminate attacks from the air, which they recognise to be contrary to the Law of Nations.Recalling the guarantees already given among themselves by the Treaty of Locarno.Have resolved to conclude a treaty with this object and have appointed as their plenipotentiaries :  .&apos;Who, having communicated their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed as follows : Article 1.In the event of one of the High Contracting Parties being the object of unprovoked aggression upon his territory by the air forces of another High Contracting Party, the other High Contracting Parties will, subject to the provisions of Article 3, immediately* come to the assistance of the Party which has been the object of such unprovoked aggression with all the air forces available for the purpose.For the purpose of this Article the territories of the High Contracting Parties are respectively Germany, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the territories on the Continent of Europe of Belgium, France and Italy.Article 2.It is understood that the provisions of Article 1 will not be applicable if the High Contracting Party who is the object of attack has resorted to war against another State, whether a party to the present Treaty or not, in violation of his treaty obligations.Article 3.The provisions of the present Treaty shall not impose any obligations upon either the United Kingdom or Italy in a case to which the obligations of that Power under Article 4 of the Treaty of Locarno would not be applicable. In particular, neither the United Kingdom nor Italy shall be under any obligation, in virtue of the present Treaty, to come to the assistance of the other.(N.B. The wording of this Article must depend on whether Italy is to receive a guarantee from anybody. As the text stands, she gets a guarantee from all the parties except the United Kingdom. It may also be necessary to provide for the position of Belgium in this Article.)Article 4.The provisions of the present Treaty are not in substitution for or qualifica-tion of any existing guarantees given by the High Contracting Parties among themselves, particularly under the Treaty of Locarno.Article 5.The present Treaty, which is designed to ensure the maintenance of peace, and is in conformity with the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Pact of Paris, shall not be interpreted as restricting the duty of the League to take whatever action may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of the world.(Article 7 of Locarno, with the addition of a reference to the Pact of Paris.)Article 6.The present Treaty shall be registered at the League of Nations in accordance with the Covenant of the League.   It shall remain in force until the? Note by Service Departments. The Chiefs of Staff in Committee of Imperial Defence Paper.No. 1161-B (also Paper No. CCS. 364), pointed out that the Treaty of Locarno contained a saving clause which placed the responsibility for the final decision to enter.the war on each country concerned. By wording such as &quot; as soon as the said Power has been, able to satisfy itself that this violation constitutes an unprovoked act of aggression,&quot; this point could be met.&quot;
Council, acting on a request of one or other of the High Contracting Parties notified to the other signatory Powers three months in advance, and voting at least by a two-thirds majority, decides that the League of Nations ensures sufficient protection to the High Contracting Parties; the Treaty shall cease to have effect on the expiration of a period of one year from such decision.(Identical with Article 8 of Locarno.)Article 7.The present Treaty shall be ratified and the ratifications shall be deposited at as soon as possible.   It shall come into force on the date onwhich [The other instruments forming the &quot;general settlement&quot;] come into force for all the High Contracting Parties.[This wording may require modification if all the High Contracting Parties are not parties to all the &quot; other instruments.&quot;]Done at &amp;c.Annex III to Enclosure.Air Ministry&apos;s Comments.Proposed Aerial Convention.   Draft Treaty of Mutual Guarantee against AirA attack.In accordance with the decision of the Committee of Imperial Defence at the 269th meeting on 16th April, 1935, the following note is submitted by the Air Ministry, in consultation with the Foreign Office, on certain points relating to the tentative draft for an Air Convention which the Foreign Office had communicated to the Committee of Imperial Defence.2. The Air Ministry are in general agreement with the draft subject to the undermentioned observations, which have been discussed with the Foreign Office.Article 1.3. (i) The Air Ministry consider that the words &quot; deliberate and &quot; should be inserted before &quot;unprovoked aggression&quot; in line 2; the Foreign Office point out that these words had been omitted as being unnecessary in view of the use of the phrase &quot; unprovoked aggression,&quot; but otherwise they would have no objection to the insertion of these words.(ii) The Air Ministry would have preferred to have specific provision made for the High Contracting Parties&apos; satisfying themselves in regard to the -occurrence of the aggression, but the Foreign Office view is that (1) the French Government would be suspicious of such a provision, (2) each Party has in any case the right to satisfy himself, whether it is so stated or not. The Air Ministry are not altogether satisfied in regard to the omission of the proposed provision and suggest that the question should be further considered.(iii) The Air Ministry consider that aggression &quot;in or over European waters &quot; should be included in the scope of the guarantee, so as to cover air attack on shipping, or on aircraft over the sea. The Foreign Office regard this question as one for the Air Ministry and the Admiralty.Article 2.4. (i) The Air Ministry consider that this article should be slightly re-worded so as to make it clear that the &quot;war&quot; referred to in line 3 is a current war.   The Foreign Office agree that thif ^rafting alteration might well be made.
s(ii) Under the Article as it stands a contracting State (&quot;A&quot;) can make an air attack upon another contracting State (&quot; B &quot;) without bringing the mutual assistance guarantee into operation if &quot;B&quot; had resorted to war in violation of treaty obligation against a third State &quot; C.&quot; The Air Ministry suggest that &quot; B\&quot; should have the benefit of the guarantee in such unless &quot; A&quot; was bound by treaty or general convention to assist &quot; C.&quot; The Foreign Office see difficulty about such a provision, which will be further discussed between the two Departments.(Sent under cover of Air Ministry letter* to Foreign Office, dated 7th May,. 1935.)
