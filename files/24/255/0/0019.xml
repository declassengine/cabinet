,   &apos; 82jqJjQCUlvmNT 13 THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJJigTY13 GOVERNMENT.^GHJT^ COPY NO-_.p. 104 (55).C A B I N.E T.COPYRIGHT RELATIONS WITH THd UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1.    The question of the possibility of placing the copyright relations between the United States of America and this country upon a basis more equitable for British authors has been the subject of diplomatic representation for many years past.2.    There is no formal treaty between the two countries on the subject of copyright.    In theory national treatment is given in each country to subjects or citizens of the other.    In actual practice, however,  the conditions under which British authors can obtain copyright for their works in the United States are not only much more onerous than those imposed upon American authors by our Copyright Act, but are also more onerous than those imposed upon works of authors of other foreign countries who are entitled to national treatment in the United States.    This arises from a provision of the United States Copyright Law under &quot;which an author-who desires to secure United States copyright for a book or periodical in the xinglish language must arrange that it shall be printed and bound in the United States.    He must also register his copyright, with payment of the prescrioed fees.    On the other hand, a United States author can obtain copyright in the United Kingdom by arranging for a few copies of his work to be placed on sale here not later than fourteen days after its publication in the United States.    He is not required to register his copyright or to print an edition here.    Further, if this formal publication here is actually simultaneous with the American publication, it secures for the American work protection throughout the other thirty-eight countries which like this country belong to the Berne Copyright Union.
3.    Apart from the complaints of British authors as totheir difficulties in securing copyright for their works inthe United States of America, demands have for many years past been made by the printing trades of this country for amanufacturing requirement to be made a condition of the grantof copyright to United States publications in this country.4.    Since the war several Bills have been introduced into the United States Congress to amend the law in order topermit of the accession of the United States to the revised Berne Copyright Convention.    Such accession would impose an obligation on the United States to grant copyright to British literary and artistic works in the United States without manufacture there or registration or any other formality, and this would give us the reciprocity we seek.    All attempts to obtain the necessary United States legislation have, however, so far proved abortive,  owing to the opposition of one or other of the interested parties in turn.5.    In March, 1930, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington addressed a formal Note to the United States Government summarizing the United Kingdom case ana alluaing to the possibility of retaliation.    In December, 1933 a further note was communicated to the United States Government again drawing attention to the desirability of remedying the present unsatisfactory position and referring more definitely to possible retaliation.    In particular the Note referred to the pressure in the Press and in parliament from authors and other interestwlparties, and it was stated that, failing appropriate action by the United States, His Majesty1s Government &quot;will Ultimately be compelled to take steps under the powers conferred by the Copyright Act, 1911, to limit the copyright protection granted to United States authors to a protection substantially equal to the protection secured to British authors under the United States Copyright Law.  &quot;Such steps&quot;, the Note  continued,  &quot;could hardly fail to involve the imposition of a requirement of printing in the United Kingdom as a condition of the grant of copyright in published works of United States authors.&quot;
6. The latest information is that the Senate &quot;ratified&apos;5 the International Copyright Convention on 19th April hut on 2ilrd April recommitted the question for further consideration. A new Bill for the amendment of the United States Copyright Law is now &quot;before the senate, hut opposition is anticipated,  and unless it passes into law the United States domestic legislation will remain in conflict with the provisions of the International Convention and there is no guarantee that, the msnufactuning requirement will be waived.      The United States Administration are in favour of the Bill,  and it is understood that it would help them to secure its passage if His Majesty&apos;s Government showed definite signs of intending to take immediate action in default of an indication that the full and effective accession of the United States to the Convention will take place shortly.      His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington who considers that the time has now come to give effect to the warnings twice addressed to the United States Government\has expressed the hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government will decide the question of retaliatory action at an early date.    Congress is expected to rise towards the end of June.    Accordingly any announcement as to our intentions should be made as soon as possible.7.  I need not say that I have no desire to impose upon American authors the disabilities from which our authors suffer in the United States provided that we can obtain fair treatment in that country.    On the other hand, both the Foreign Secretary and I are convinced that unless we give some evidence of being prepared to implement the threat of retaliatory action made in 1933,  there is very little chance of Congress taking the necessary steps.s
8. The Copyright Act,  1911,  contains certain provisions enabling retaliatory action to he taken against countries which discriminate against British authors.      The Law Officers have, however, advised that whilst the existing powers would allow His Majesty&apos;s Government to deprive all American authors of copyright facilities here,   they would not enable us to retaliate,   as we should wish to do, by refusing the grant of copyright to American authors who did not have their books printed and bound in this country.    This is the counterpart to the position in the United States and to go further and penalise all American authors would be to invite drastic reprisals which might be extremely injurious to British interests.9.  I propose that the State Department at Washington should be informed that,  in view of the disabilities under which British authors suffer in the United States in marked contrast to the treatment accorded to authors of other foreign countries, His Majesty&apos;s Government have given instructions for a Bill to he prepared giving them power to impose in this country similar disabilities upon American authors.    The foreign Secretary agrees with this proposal.10.  I should propose again to consult my colleagues on the question of the actual introduction of legislation if Congress rises without taking steps to remedy the present position notwithstanding the communication which,  I  suggest,  should be made to the United States Government.W.R.Board of Trade, 17th May,  1955.
