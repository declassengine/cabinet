illmThe Commissioner for the Special Areas: (England and Wales),Broadway Buildings,Broadway,London, S.W.i.4th July, 1935.Dear Mr. Brown,Now that the Special Areas Act has been on the Statute Book some six months, it is desirable that I should render an account of my stewardship. At the end of January I issued to the Press a general statement of my policy and since then I have issued periodical statements on special items of interest.I promised your predecessor, Mr. Stanley, that I would sub-mit a detailed account of my activities up to the end of June, and I have felt that it would be appropriate at the same time to give an indication of the provisional conclusions I have reached regarding the further measures which should be taken to deal with the problem of the Special Areas.I am, therefore, submitting herewith a detailed report, divided into seven parts as under, following by a General Review and Conclusions.I.	Introduction.2.	Industry.3;	Public Works.4-	Agriculture.	Other Measures of Social Improvement6.	Transference.7-	Finance.I wish to express my gratitude for the help received from my District Commissioners who, living on the spot, have closely watched over the interests of the Special Areas with the able assistance of their executive staffs.My appreciation and thanks are with much pleasure recorded of the arduous and excellent work done by my staff at Head-quarters. The rapid progress made in dealing with the many problems and matters affecting the Special Areas has been made possible by their keen interest in and devotion to the work.30564 A 2
It has been a novel and interesting experience for me to see from behind the scenes and at close quarters the work of our admirable Civil Service. Their loyalty and wide experience fortunately available irrespective of the changes of political parties, are a national asset. The smooth and efficient working of democratic Government in this country is largely due to the good work of our Civil Service.I am,Yours sincerely,P. M^. Stewart.The Right Hon. Ernest Brown, M.C., M.P., Minister of Labour,Montagu House,Whitehall, S.W.i.

FIRST REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER FOR THE SPECIAL AREAS (ENGLAND AND WALES)PART I INTRODUCTIONEvents Prior to AppointmentI. In April, 1934 the Government appointed^Investigators to examine and report on conditions pertaining in certain parts of the country which were suffering from acute industrial depression and its effects. These reports, which were of a confidential nature, were presented in the late summer. When Parliament met in the autumn, the Government were pressed to publish the reports, and agreed, with the consent of the Investigators, to present them to Parliament with the deletion of certain passages of a confidential nature. The Reports were accordingly pre-sented in November, 1934. There were three areas in England and Wales which had received special examination:Tyneside and the Northern part of Durham County. (Investigator: Capt. D. Euan Wallace, M.C., M.P.).West Cumberland and Haltwhistle.(Investigator: Rt. Hon. J. C. C. Davidson, C.H., C.B., M.P. now Sir John Davidson).Parts of South Wales.(Investigator: Sir Wyndham Portal, Bart., D.S.O., M.V.O.  now Lord Portal).Announcement in parliament . Following the publication of the Reports, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on 14th November, 1934, informed Parlia-ment that the Government had decided to appoint two Com-missioners, one for the depressed areas of Scotland and one for those of England and Wales, to be invested with wide powers and untrammelled by ordinary Departmental routine, to look after the interests of the areas which had been investigated. They were to be allotted a substantial sum to spend at their discretion, and an initial amount of two million pounds was to be paid into a special fund which they should administer. The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that Sir Arthur Rose had agreed to act in an honorary capacity as Commissioner for the Areas in Scotland and that I had agreed to act similarly for the Areas in England and Wales. He promised: the imme-diate introduction of a Bill to give authority for the necessary powers.
The Special Areas (Development and Improvement) Act, 19343. The Bill was introduced on 26th November, 1934, under the title of the Depressed Areas (Development and Improvement) Bill, but in response to criticism the word &quot; Depressed &quot; was deleted in the House of Lords and the word &quot; Special &quot; sub-stituted. The Bill was passed rapidly through both Houses of Parliament and received Royal Assent on 21st December, 1934.Statements in Debate4. It will be useful at this stage to recall some of the statements made during the passage of the Bill by representatives of the Government, both as to the powers of the Commissioners and as to the financial proposals.The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Neville Chamberlain) said on the 14th November.:  Although in the present case we need not describe the disease as desperate it certainly is sufficiently exceptional to warrant exceptional treatment. What we want here, as it seems to us, is something more rapid, more direct, less orthodox if you like, than the ordinary plan, and if we are to do what seems to me even more important than the improvement of the physical condition, if we are to effect the spiritual regeneration of these areas, and if we are to inspire their people with a new interest in life and a new hope for the future, we have to convince them that these reports are not going to gather dust in some remote pigeon hole but that they will be the subject of continuous executive action.:. . .We have resolved to cut through all the ordinary methods and adopt a plan which we conceive is more suitable to these special conditions than the methods which, in the ordinary course, would be applied to such a problem. ...We are going to give the Commissioners a very wide dis-cretion. They must not be afraid of trying experiments even if those experiments fail.The Minister of Labour (Mr. Oliver Stanley) said on the same day:-Of course the Commissioner will be responsible through me . to Parliament for broad policy. I shall have to answer for it in the House, but I hope we shall be able to leave him as far as possible, unhampered in the day-to-day administra-tion of his duties and that he will be able to act with speed and decision and without the fear that everything he does must be weighed in case of a failure which, might afterwards be held up against him. &quot;
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour (Mr. R. S. Hudson) said on the following day:  There are in this country a large number of people who have valuable ideas, but it is very difficult to put them into practice if you go through the elaborate procedure of Government Departments to make sure that every single thing you do will stand the criticism of the Public Accounts Committee of this House and questions across the Floor. We believe that it is possible to cut that procedure short and to go behind a great deal of red tape. It is precisely to enable experiments on a very large scale of every sort and kind to be made in the depressed areas with a view to solving these very problems that we&apos; have set up these Commissioners.The Paymaster-General (Lord Rochester) said on the 19th November:  The first striking point, therefore, in the proposals in the Bill, is that the Commissioners have wide powers which they can freely exercise.On the question of finance, the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Neville Chamberlain) said on the 14th November:  While it would be absurd to set aside an extravagant sum which might not be wanted, what I desire at the present time is to provide sufficient to carry them on at any rate for a considerable time.The Minister of Labour (Mr. Oliver Stanley) said on the same day:-What the Chancellor of the Exchequer wants to do is to provide at the beginning sufficient finance for the Com-missioners to make certain that they can start any scheme they think fit without being hampered by lack of financial resources and, as we see the schemes develop and their value being proved, the House can decide in the normal way when and how much is to be added to this fund.The Prime Minister (Mr. Ramsay MacDonald) said on the 20th November:  Who is going to say how much is going to be required ? It would have been sheer folly for us to have said , 20,000,000,  50,000,000 or  100,000,000. That is not the way to do it. It is an unbusinesslike way to solve this question because we desire to get some real solution, and not merely a stop gap solution. An unbusinesslike way was to give those big sums. The businesslike way is to say &quot; I mention a sum which I put at your disposal. It will be sufficiently big for you to feel confident that you are going to get what is necessary.   The ground has been surveyed.   The problem
is now clear.  You go down.  You face it.  You deal with it. You spend money on it, and I will stand by you.&quot; That is the position, roughly and generally, of the Government. Referring to the initial sum of two million pounds, the Prime Minister said that it was perfectly clear from the Chancellor of the Exchequers words that this was &quot;a sort of token payment.&quot;The Minister of Labour (Mr. Oliver Stanley) on the 3rd December said:  A fund is set up for the use of these Commissioners, and, in the first place, a sum of  2,000,000 is paid into the fund. We believe that that, at any rate, gives them sufficient financial assistance with which to inaugurate any experi-ments which they have in mind upon a sufficiently con-siderable scale, but we do not pretend, and I do not believe anybody in the House could be able to assume, what their financial requirements are likely to be.And on the 5th December the Minister of Labour (Mr. Oliver Stanley) said:- The idea of the financial arrangement is that the Commis-sioners shall start off with enough money to make it quite certain that they will be enabled to undertake any experi-ment and work which they think is necessary, and that thereafter, as and when the Government and Parliament think that more money should be given to them, that will be done.The Paymaster-General (Lord Rochester) on the 19th December said:  The , 2,000,000 is in the nature of a token vote and merely a preliminary figure for the three months ending next March.Summary of the Act5. It will also be useful to give a brief summary of the Act, and the following summary is accordingly reproduced from the Annual Report of the Ministry of Labour for 1934.The Act provides for the appointment of two Commissioners whose functions are described as &quot; the initiation, organisa-tion, prosecution and assistance of measures designed to facilitate the economic development and social improve-ment &quot; of the special areas that is, of the areas covered by the investigations made earlier in the year. One of the Commissioners is responsible for the special areas in England and Wales and the other for those in Scotland; they are to act under the general control of the Minister of Labour and the Secretary of State for Scotland respectively.
The Commissioners are required to make suggestions to and co-operate with Government Departments, Local Authori-ties, voluntary organisations and other bodies concerned with matters within their functions and, in particular, to make recommendations as to the removal of difficulties which appear to them to prevent or hinder measures which might be carried out under statutory powers and which in their opinion ought to be carried out. They are precluded from carrying on any undertaking for the purpose of gain and from providing financial assistance to such an under-taking, or to a Local Authority, except that they may provide financial assistance(a) to any undertaking carried on with the primaiy object of providing means of livelihood for the persons engaged in it with a view to establishing them in a position of complete or partial independence of unemployment assistance or public assistance; or(b) subject to the consent of the appropriate Minister, to a Local Authority, by way of grant or loan, for the purpose of contributing towards the cost of any works for which no specific grant is payable by any Govern-ment Department, or towards the provision of small holdings or allotments.The Commissioners are given power to prosecute or assist measures outside the special areas in so far as they are satisfied that such measures will afford employment or occupation for substantial numbers of persons from those areas. They may acquire land and, for the purpose of their functions, purchase it compulsorily.The Act is to continue in force until 31st March, 1937, and no longer unless Parliament otherwise determines. On its expiry the functions of the Commissioners may be trans-ferred by Order in Council to the Unemployment Assistance Board or any other Government Department.Directions in which powers are limited6. There has been much misunderstanding as to the extent of the powers vested in the Commissioners, perhaps partly due to statements made by Members of the Government during the passage of the Bill. It is therefore desirable to explain some of the limitations which the Act imposes. These are mainly in the following directions: (1) The Commissioner for the Special Areas in England and Wales acts under the general control of the Minister of Labour.   He has therefore to seek the Ministers sanction to all main lines of policy;   The Minister of Labour is responsible to Parliament for the way in which the money
voted is expended, and the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Labour as Accounting Officer will have to answer for the Commissioner to the Public Accounts Com-mittee. These limitations are no doubt necessary in order to conform to Parliamentary practice in regard to finance, but they clearly make the Commissioner as much subject to orthodox financial control as any Government Department. Whilst they may not actually hamper the freedom and initiative of the Commissioner so far as making proposals is concerned, they do result in restricting his powers to carry these proposals into effect.(2) The Commissioner is not directly charged with the duty of relieving unemployment b3^ the provision of work. His functions are very different from those of the late Unem-ployment Grants Committee, which, although it sponsored works of economic development, was primarily concerned with the stimulation of works to give employment. The Commissioner, on the other hand, is solely concerned with measures designed to facilitate the economic development or social improvement of the areas. Economic develop-ment is a long term policy, and any proposal for a scheme of public utility must be looked at, not from the point of view of the immediate employment it will give, but rather the extent to which the work when completed will lead to the economic development of the area. Relief schemes, designed solely to give employment, but having no further object, cannot be entertained. It should be stated that I am fully in agreement with this limitation of my powers in regard to relief works, and have been pleased to find in dealing with representatives of locai authorities in the Special Areas that most of them have no wish to undertake relief schemes which do not yield justifiable value in addition to providing work.(3) Except in relation to the provision of small holdings, the Commissioner cannot supplement a specific grant made or offered by a Government Department. If, for instance, the Minister of Transport thinks that he is justified on account of traffic needs in offering a local authority a 60 per cent, grant towards making a new road, and the authority cannot afford to find the remaining 40 per cent., the Commissioner is unable to offer to bear any of the local authority&apos;s portion, even though the road would in his opinion lead to the economic development of the area.(4) Similarly, except in relation to the provision of small holdings or allotments, the Commissioner cannot offer a grant to a local authority for any service for which a specific grant is payable by any Government Department.
The exact meaning of the word &quot; payable &quot; in this connec-tion has been the subject of much controversy. The official legal opinion interprets the word &quot; payable &quot; as meaning &quot; that may be paid or that there is power to pay &quot;, and adds that a grant does not cease to be &quot; payable &apos;&apos; because the Government Department, which has power to make the grant, chooses either generally or in a particular instance not to exercise the power. Incidentally, it is interesting to note that the opposite opinion has been expressed by two eminent King&apos;s Counsel. This ruling has produced a disappointing position. It has rendered it impossible for the Commissioner to give local authorities in the Special Areas any financial assistance towards the construction of roads, bridges, tunnels, canals or quays, or towards any educational service. On the other hand, he has the power to give grants for similar purposes to such bodies as Harbour Authorities or River Commissioners, not being local authorities, provided they are not carrying on an undertaking for the purpose of gain. It will thus be seen , that the question whether the Commissioner is in a position to assist a thoroughly desirable scheme may depend on fortuitous circumstances.One serious effect of this embargo is that, in the schemes which have been initiated for site improvements with a view to industrial development, it is impossible to give any grant towards the cost of the roadways, which are an essential and integral part of the scheme. These roads, which often form an appreciable proportion of the cost of the scheme, though vital to the project itself, will have no through traffic value and consequently, though in theory eligible, will never in fact qualify for a grant from the Road Fund. It is a serious disadvantage that in such cases as this the necessary assistance cannot be provided.I , recognise that it is within my powers to make repre-sentations to the Government Departments concerned to give exceptional grants in such cases, but I appreciate their difficulty in departing from their general standards in specific cases a difficulty which would have been met if the Commissioner had been given power to make grants out of the Special Areas Fund, the object of which was to meet the special needs of the areas.(5) The Commissioner cannot give financial assistance towards the establishment of new industries operating for profit. This limitation of the Commissioners powers is clearly desirable, though it debars the giving of any help in a direction where help is badly needed. This question is dealt with further in paragraphs 30 to 32 below.
(6) The areas in which or to which assistance can be given are limited to those set out in the First Schedule to the Act, and nothing can be done outside those areas unless it will afford employment or occupation for substantial numbers of persons from those areas. The definition of the areas has not led to serious inconvenience in the North, though for some reasons it would have been simpler if the whole of County Durham had been included. In Wales, however, the exclusion of important cities and towns such as Cardiff, Newport and Swansea has created an artificial boundary within an established industrial region. South Wales is in essence one economic unit, and it is impossible, in my view, to determine the prospects of the mining valleys irrespective of their relation to large industrial centres nearby.(7) A legal opinion has been given that the Act does not authorise the initiation, organisation, prosecution or assistance of any measures outside England, Wales and Scotland. But for this decision, financial assistance would have been given to enable the Child Emigration Society to establish a school in New Zealand or Canada, similar to the excellent Fairbridge Farm School in Australia but con-fined to children from the Special Areas, whose parents or guardians agreed and whose circumstances made it desirable that they should be given an opportunity of a healthier and happier life than unfortunately they can at present look for in this country. This opinion has also made it im-possible to assist the Development Councils to advertise their areas abroad.(8) A further legal opinion has been given to the effect that the provision of hostels to accommodate persons transferred from the Special Areas to districts in which the chances of employment are favourable is outside the Commissioners&apos; powers because such hostels do not of themselves &quot; afford employment or occupation &apos;&apos;, although it is generally agreed that they greatly facilitate the opportunities for obtaining such employment. I regard the provision of such hostels as a most important part of any transference policy, and regret my inability to contribute to the cost involved.(9) Finally, by the terms of the Second Schedule of the Act, no officer or servant may be appointed to assist in the work of the Commissioner until the consent of both the Minister of Labour and of the Treasury has been obtained.Organisation created7. During the passage of the Special Areas Bill through Parliament the necessary organisation was created. Offices were opened at Broadway Buildings, Broadway, Westminster, S.W.I,
before the end of November, 1934, and a nucleus staff appointed, mostly of officers lent by different Government Departments. It has throughout been my policy to keep the staff to the lowest number compatible with efficiency; it was clearly undesirable to create a large staff for an organisation which would probably last less than two and a half years, and it has been possible to achieve this end, partly by the policy of acting in the main through existing organisations as described in Part III of this Report, and partly by the ready help which has been rendered by all Government Departments approached. Throughout, there has been close co-operation with and valuable help rendered by the Ministry of Labour. Special thanks are due to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Transport who, by allowing me to draw on the skilled services of their technical staffs, have made it unnecessary for me to establish a separate engineering department for preparation and supervision of the technical work in connection with schemes under consideration or in operation.District Commissioners8. At the same time a local organisation was established in each of the Special Areas, to which District Commissioners were appointed. For Durham and Tyneside I was fortunate in securing the services of Mr. Colin Forbes Adam, C.S.I., who was well acquainted with local, conditions, as he had rendered valuable assistance to Captain Euan Wallace in the preparation of his report. His office is at Newcastle-on-Tyne. Captain Geoffrey Crawshay, whose home is in Monmouthshire, and who has had wide experience of social work among the unemployed, is District Commissioner for South Wales, with an office at Cardiff. Mr. L. St. Clare Grondona, who has made a close study of land settlement and marketing problems, is District Commissioner for West Cumberland with an office at Whitehaven.9. Regular conferences are held in London with the District Commissioners so as to secure exchange of ideas and co-ordination of work. I have also personally visited the different Areas.Statistical Survey10. Before a description is given of the work attempted and accomplished it is desirable to include a short statistical survey of the position in the Areas at the time the Special Areas Act was passed and of the changes which have taken place during the last six months.Unemployment (See Appendices I, II and III)11. At 26th November, 1934, the number of persons in the Special Areas (aged 14 or over, uninsured as well as insured)
IOwho were registered as unemployed at the Ministry of Labour Local Offices was 347,566. This number represented 35-3 per cent, of the total insured population (aged 16-64) Qf the. Special Areas at July, 1934.At the same date, the number of persons registered as unemployed in England and Wales was 1,793,067, or 16-0 per cent, of the total insured population; and in Great Britain 2,120,785, or 16-9 per cent.At 17th December, 1934, the figure for the Special Areas had fallen to 343,992 and the percentage by 0-3; but the percentage for England and Wales and for Great Britain had also fallen, each by 0-3.During the next two months, there was a rise of 18,001 in the figure for the Special Areas as a whole; at 25th February, 1935, it had reached 361,993, or 36-8 per cent. During these two months the percentage for the whole of England and Wales, after rising rather sharply in January by 1-9 had fallen slightly during February by 0^3. The figure for Great Britain had followed the same course.After 25th February, 1935, a decrease occurred each month in the figure for the Special Areas as a whole; at 20th May, it had become 339,095, or 34-5 per ,cent. The figure for England and Wales and that for Great Britain also continued to fall except that, at 20th May, a slight increase was recorded. The figure for England and Wales was then 1,733,913, or 15-5 per cent., and that for Great Britain was 2,044,752, or 16-3 per cent.12. During the period of six months under review, the position in the West Cumberland Special Area improved to an appre-appreciable extent. At 26th November, 1934, the figure was 13,530, or 38-3 per cent., whereas at 20th May, 1935, it had fallen to ri,789, or 33-3 per cent. The position in the South Wales Special Area showed little variation during the same period. At 20th May, 1935, the number unemployed was 157,252 as com-pared with 157,174 at 26th November, 1934; an increase in the percentage figure of o-i. The figures for the Durham and Tyneside Special Area show, over the whole period, a slight improvement, the figures at the beginning and end of the period being : 176,862, or 33-5 per cent, and 170,054, or 32-2 per cent.Comprehensive figures are given in Appendix I.13. Appendix II shows the number of &quot; Registered Wholly Unemployed &quot; persons in the Special Areas at intervals of roughly one month during the period under review, dis-distinguishing between Men, Women and Juveniles. It will be seen that the improvement, referred to above, in total unem-ployment is also apparent in these figures, which relate to wholly
unemployed only. The figures for Juveniles show the usual large increase at the end of the Christmas term. The figures in Appendix II make it clear that the main unemployment problem in the Special Areas is &quot;among men.14. An analysis, as at 15th April, 1935, of the number of unemployed men applicants for benefit or allowances (aged 18 to 64 years) in the Special Areas, on the basis of the length of their last spell of unemployment, is given in Appendix III together with corresponding figures for Great Britain.It will be seen that, at the date selected, of the total number (236,887) of such men in the Special Areas, the number who had been unemployed for at least a year was 121,100, or 51 -1 per cent. The figure for the whole of Great Britain was 362,405 out of 1,458,806, or 24-8 per cent. At 26th November, 1934, the figures were 123,555, or 5I-4 Per cent, for the Special Areas and 367,947, or 23-9 per cent., for Great Britain.Changes in Population.   (See Appendix IV)15. The total population of the Special Areas in 1921 was 2,968,056; in 1931: 2,894,469 a decrease of 73,587; and in mid-1934 (estimated): 2,871,160 a further decrease of 23,309.Corresponding figures for the whole of England and Wales were: in 1921: 37,886,699; in 1931; 39,952,377 an increase of 2,065,678; and in mid-1934 (estimated) : 40,467,000 a further increase of 514,623.These figures show that, whereas the population of England and Wales as a whole has increased during the last 13 years, and the increase between 1931 and 1934 has been at approxi-mately the same rate as in the previous ten years, the popula-tion of the Special Areas has decreased, and the rate of decrease between 1931 and 1934 has been higher than that during the preceding ten years.Appendix IV also shows percentages of population aged under 15, 15-50 and over 50. The interesting feature is that the Special Areas contain a considerably higher percentage of people under the age of 15 than the rest of the country.Birth-rate, Death-rate and rate of Infantile Mortality.    (See Appendix V)16. In 1933, the birth-rate in England and Wales as a whole was 14-4 per thousand population. Corresponding figures for the Special Areas were: Durham and Tyneside: 17 -1; South Wales: 16-4; and Cumberland (the Administrative County  figures for the Special Area not being available): 15-8.The death-rate in England and Wales was 12-3. In the South Wales Special Area it was 12-4; in the Durham and Tyneside Special Area: 12-4; and in Cumberland: 13-8.
The number of babies, per 1,000 born, who died before their first birthday, was 64-0 in England and Wales; 80-8 in Durham and Tyneside; 78-3 in South Wales; and 71-0 in Cumberland.Factories Opened and Closed.   (See Appendix VI)17. During 1934, 14 new factories were opened in the Special Areas, 12 being in the Durham and Tyneside Area and one in each of the other Areas. It is estimated that these provide employment for about 750 workpeople. In addition two factories (both in the Durham and Tyneside Area) were extended.During the same period, n factories in the Special Areas were closed, eight of these being in the Durham and Tyneside Area. No figures are available of the effect on unemployment of the closing of these factories.Coal Production.   (See Appendix VII)18. In 1929, certain districts in Northumberland, Durham, Cumberland, Westmorland, South Wales and Monmouthshire, which included the Special Areas, raised 46-4 per cent, of the total quantity of saleable coal raised in England and Wales; and thus provided employment for 44-1 per cent, of the wage-earners in the industry in England and Wales. In 1934, the figure for coal raised in the same districts had fallen to 42 - 9 per cent, and that for wage-earners to 42-4 per cent.Between 1929 and 1934, there was a reduction of saleable coal raised, in the districts mentioned, from 109 million tons to a little over 81 million tons, and a reduction in the number of wage earners from 371,000 to 293,000.Preliminary ActionOffers of Service19. As soon as my appointment was announced, letters began to pour in with suggestions and offers of service, not only from this country but from all over the world. It was clear that I had undertaken a task in which I had the goodwill of the entire nation, and throughout the last six months in all my dealings, whether with Cabinet Ministers, with members of His Majesty&apos;s Opposition, with local authorities or with members of the public, I have continually found a willingness to co-operate and assist. The will to help is ever present; the diffi-culty is to find the means by which that willingness can be turned into practical channels of assistance.All letters were considered and dealt with. Immediate use could not be made of a tithe of the offers of service, but in some cases it was possible to suggest directions in which service could be profitably given.
Suggestions20. The suggested cures were also considered; many had been made by enthusiasts who felt that they had discovered a panacea for the evils of unemployment and industrial depres-sion which had been afflicting the whole world. Most were, unfortunately, found on examination to have some fatal flaw, but all suggestions that merited examination were referred for expert advice and in a few cases profitable action has followed. Examination of Reports of Investigators21. The reports of the Investigators referred to in paragraph i of this Report were also examined with minute care. Most of their major recommendations involved Government action and were outside my powers to implement, but many of the recom-mendations lying within my power have been adopted and put into effect.Co-operation with Government Departments22. One of the statutory duties of the Commissioner is to make suggestions to and co-operate with Government Depart-ments. I am more and more convinced that the major problems of the Special Areas cannot be isolated and left to one small Department; they must be tackled by the Government as a whole and there is hardly a Government Department which can-not and should not help. It is clearly uneconomical and inefficient for the Commissioner to initiate activities which can better be performed by existing Departments already possessing the necessary machinery and experience.23. Considerable use has therefore been made of my right to approach Departments and to seek their help. In some cases the representations made have been of a confidential nature and full particulars cannot be given in a public report, but the following list of Departments approached will indicate the extent to which this duty has been exercised:  Admiralty.Air Ministry.Board of Education.Board of Trade.Commissioner of Crown Lands.Forestry Commission.Inland Revenue District Valuer&apos;s Department.Mines Department.Ministry of Agriculture.Ministry of Health.Ministry of Labour.Ministry of Transport.Overseas Settlement Department.Treasury.Unemployment Assistance Board-War Office.
24. With some of these Departments, notably the Ministries of Agriculture, Health and Labour and the Unemployment Assistance Board, I have been constantly in touch. The Ministry of Labour had for many years before my appointment been paying special attention to the problem of surplus labour in the Areas and had developed a national system of transference and training. It was clearly wise to leave the Ministry to develop their policy in these directions and to co-operate with them so far as lay within my power.PART II INDUSTRY Establishment of new industries the Present Position25. The Special Areas are in their present unfortunate position owing to the decline of the main industries, coal mining, ship building and.iron and steel, which attracted such large numbers of workers to them during the nineteenth century under more prosperous conditions. It seems unlikely that these industries will again employ the numbers engaged in them even up to ten years ago. During the period of prosperity large com-munities with full equipment of railways, roads, houses, schools and other municipal and social services were created. Many millions of pounds were spent in building up these services. A large proportion of the inhabitants have been associated with the Areas for several generations; they are bound to the Areas by ties of home and family and religion, by local patriotism and, especially in Wales, by a fervent national spirit and, some-times, a distinctive language. It is natural, therefore, that wherever one goes in these Areas one should be met by the demand that something should be done to attract fresh industries to the Area. This is the general request, and I regard it as at once the most important and the most difficult of my duties to try to satisfy it. I have given more time and personal attention to this side of my work than to any other, but it must be frankly admitted that up to the present the results have been negligible. Many of the negotiations I have initiated with this end in view were necessarily confidential, and it would only prejudice the present slender chances of success if I were to give a full account of them. The following paragraphs will, however, indicate the main lines on which I have been working.Approaches to Firms26. In the first place I approached a number of the larger and more prosperous firms in the country in the hope that I might persuade them to open new branches of their industry in one or other of the Special Areas. Without exception they were sympathetic to my representations, but except in one case they had good reasons which made it impossible for them to
accede to -my request. In the one case negotiations are still proceeding, and I hope a new factory in one of the Areas may result.27. I paid attention to the possibility of reviving the iron.and steel industry in the Areas, particularly at Ebbw Vale and on Tyneside. Schemes have been prepared but have had to be abandoned. Lengthy negotiations and inquiries have taken place Sir Andrew Duncan has been sympathetic to the repre-sentations I have made to him, but so far it has not been possible to translate this into action. Negotiations are proceeding, but it is too early yet to forecast the result. I have consistently refused to make promises or hold out hopes until performance was assured.28. It was impossible for me to approach personally the many likely firms in the country. Therefore through the courtesy and with the co-operation of the Federation of British Industries I sent a circular letter in May and June to some 5,800 firms in England and Wales connected with the Federation. Letters were sent to all such firms outside the Special Areas except those dealing in coal, cotton, shipbuilding and iron and steel, and they were asked to complete and return to me a questionnaire on the possibility of their establishing a new branch in one of the Special Areas.   The result is disappointing.The three main questions asked were (1) whether the firms had established any works or branches in a Special Area during the past few years, (2) whether they had considered the choice of a site in a Special Area within the past five years and (3) whether they were now prepared to consider such a choice. Up to 29th June, 1934, 1,711 replies were received of which 1,651 answered all three questions in the negative. Of the remaining 60 replies, one contained affirmative answers to all three ques-tions, 36 answered the first only in the affirmative, 7 answered the last question in the affirmative and 16, while replying in the affirmative to the second question, answered the first and third in the negative.Possible reasons preventing the establishment of new factories in the Special Areas29. Some hundreds of new factories have been established in recent years in the Midlands and South; but very few in the Special Areas. Why is this so ? The main reasons appear to fall in the following categories :  (1) Inaccessibility to markets. This applies particularly- to Cumberland. In the other areas, it is not a factor of prime importance. South Wales, Durham and Tyneside are well equipped with rail and road facilities and the Northern Areas are much nearer to the big markets in Lancashire and Yorkshire than is London or the South.
i.6(2) High rates. These probably have a deterrent effect on employers out of proportion to their real significance, especially as the Local Government Act, 1929, has very materially reduced the rate charge on industrial establish-ments. This question is dealt with further in paragraph 35 below.(3) Fear of industrial unrest. This fear is very general and is bred from past disputes mainly in the coal-mining industry. It prevails particularly with regard to South Wales, but the facts scarcely warrant the attitude adopted. Statistics apart from those of coal-mining do not justify the fear which undoubtedly exists in the minds of many employers.Most industries in these Areas have been exceptionally free of labour troubles, and I am satisfied that no employer, : who is prepared to offer fair and reasonable conditions of employment, need hesitate for one moment to establish a new factory in these Areas for fear of industrial troubles. Trades Union Leaders and the unemployed are anxious for opportunity to show the spirit of co-operation.(4) The fact that the areas are, and have for some years been, suffering from industrial depression. This factor, coupled with the common application to them of the term &quot; depressed &quot; or &quot; distressed &quot; areas, has itself a deterrent effect. While it is true that &quot; trade brings trade &quot;, the converse unfortunately is equally true. Unemployment undermines business confidence and reduces purchasing power. A vicious circle is thus set up. The action taken to alter the title of the Act, as mentioned in paragraph 3, was an initial step in the right direction, but the difficulty goes far beyond the mere question of epithets.(5) Difficulty in obtaining finance to start new industries. This is dealt with in the following paragraphs.Difficulty of getting Capital30. It has constantly been represented to me that one of the impediments in the way of the establishment of new industries or.expansion of existing industries in these Areas is the difficulty of getting capital. It is stated that Managers of local branches of the Banks are no longer as ready as they were formerly to advance capital on prospects and personality unsupported by tangible assets. Details have been given to me of several new factories which would have been established if the necessary capital could have been made available. The terms of the Special Areas Act debar me from giving financial assistance from the Special Areas Fund to such undertakings, but I have
9 9 7had several discussions on the subject with Mr. Gibson Jarvie, the Chairman and Managing Director of Credit for Industry, Limited, Mr. Jarvie has agreed to co-operate with me to the maximum of his power. He is willing to investigate any genuine proposal requiring new capital for starting a new factory or expanding an existing industry in the Special Areas, and is prepared to co-operate with the Industrial Development Councils in each Area. It has to be remembered, however, that Credit for Industry is itself a business concern, established to supply credit for industries on a sound financial basis, and while it may be prepared to assess a Company&apos;s prospects in considering a loan, and to take greater risks than Banking Institutions, and is willing to grant loans up to 20 years, it has to be assured of the financial soundness of any undertaking before it would be justified in giving assistance. It is understood that in some cases, when Credit for Industry has gone to the trouble and expense of investigating a proposal and has indicated its willingness to offer assistance, the Banks have stepped in and on the strength of the investigation have offered a loan which they had previously refused.31. It appears, however, that the assistance which Credit for Industry can give is not of itself sufficient to meet the needs of the Special Areas. Most of the proposals which have been sub-mitted to me from these Areas and referred to Credit for Industry have not so far satisfied the criteria which the Company is bound to apply. Something more is required. Some greater risks must be run. An experiment in that direction has been made by Northern Industries Development Limited, but the capital which they were able to raise on Tyneside was not sufficient to enable them to operate on a sufficiently large scale to give the experiment a fair chance.Possible need for a Special Fund32. It seems doubtful whether any organisation run on a purely commercial basis can meet the needs of the Areas. Exactly what those needs are no-one can at present say. I am therefore proposing to take further steps in order to ascer-tain the extent of the demand for financial assistance. If, as a result, it is found that there is a real opening for new enter-prise in the Areas if the necessary capital were provided (especially for smaller undertakings and those which are not large enough to float a public issue), I may find it necessary to advise that a special fund should be created for the purpose. It seems likely that there may be a number of proposals which involve risks which Credit for Industry cannot legitimately take, but which could justifiably be taken at the expense of a fund specially created for the purpose. A number of failures must be expected, but if only, say, half the enterprises succeed,
fresh life and fresh hope would have been given to the Areas, and the saving in unemployment benefit and allowances would go a long way to counter-balance the loss involved. The establishment of such a fund is outside the Commissioners&apos; powers under the Special Areas Act, but, if I am satisfied that there is a real demand for financial assistance for such under-takings, I shall not hesitate to urge the Government to take the necessary steps either to provide or to secure the provision of the required fund.Industrial Development Councils33. In each of the Special Areas there is an Industrial Development Council, whose main purpose is to develop local industries. These Councils, if efficiently conducted and truly representative of the leading employers in the area, should be able to do more to revive local industry than any outside body operating from a distance. My policy throughout has been to help the Areas to help themselves, and with this end in view these Councils have been promised financial assistance from the Special Areas Fund see paragraphs 39 to 42. Every assistance will be given to the Councils to enable them to become bodies of real influence and weight in their respective Areas and to prove effective in establishing and attracting new industries to their district. The future of the Special Areas largely depends on the energy they put into this work and the local support received.Clearance of Sites34. As already indicated, I have no power as Commissioner to finance the establishment of new industries; all I can do is to make personal representations to firms regarding the opportunities afforded in the Special Areas. In order, however, to pave the way for new industries and to remove some of the unsightly surroundings of possible industrial areas, a number of schemes, of which fuller particulars are given in Part III of this Report, have been approved for grant, particularly on Tyneside, and assistance given to local authorities to clear sites in areas where there is a reasonable prospect of future economic development. In certain of the urban districts, however, notably the Rhondda, the configuration of the land is such that it is doubtful if suitable sites for new industries could be prepared even if new industries were prepared to come to the area.Local Rates35. No report on the Special Areas would be complete without a reference to the question of rates. It has often been repre-sented to me that one of the reasons, if not one of the main reasons, for the continued failure of the Special Areas to attract
new industries is the persistence of high rates. In view, how-ever, of the de-rating provisions of the Local Government Act, 1929, under which industrial hereditaments pay only one-quarter of &quot;the rates, and of the comparatively low basis of assessments which obtains generally in the areas, it seems to me that the influence of rates on the overhead charges would not of itself prove a deterrent to establishing a factory in these Areas. This view is confirmed by replies received to the questionnaire addressed to representative manufacturers and associations of manufacturers. While high rates undoubtedly have a psychological effect in discouraging casual enquirers for sites from proceeding, both the decline of industry and the reluctance to start new industries are in the main due to other factors, which have operated to prevent the fulfillment of the hope expressed in 1928 by Mr. Winston Churchill, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, that the de-rating provisions of the Local Government Bill would improve the industrial prospects of localities such as the Special Areas.These factors are dealt with in paragraph 29 of this Report.36. Apart, however, from their effect on industry, it cannot be denied that high rates are a serious burden. In the Special Areas, both in the North-East and in South Wales, the rates continue in many local authority districts to be abnormally high, and unfortunately there seems little reason for hoping that the burden will be reduced in the near future without an extraordinary effort on the part of local authorities or additional help from the Government.Assistance from the Govermnent37. The Exchequer assistance is at present made either by direct grants or by means of the distribution of the fixed annual grant in the manner provided for in the Local Govern-ment Act, 1929. An increase in the amount of assistance would almost be bound to involve the more difficult question of the continued autonomy of the authorities concerned, and it would no doubt be considered to be essential to ascertain to what extent economies, if any, could properly be effected.As regards the grants already made under the Local Govern-ment Act, it has been represented strongly to me that the result of the Transference Policy of the Government, combined with the natural tendency to migrate from areas of depressed trade, has been in South Wales, and will be in the North-East, to reduce the population and rateable value and to leave the areas an abnormal proportion of sick and aged persons. It has been pointed out that, in the absence of special provision, the allocations of the block grants at present made to the areas will be reduced, as those grants are partly distributed on a &quot; weighted &quot; population basis.   The effect will be to increase
the expenditure, which will fall to be borne by fewer people. I understand tbat the working of the formula on which the block grants are distributed will, in accordance with the require-ments of the Local Government Act, 1929, shortly be considered by the Government in consultation with representative local government organisations, and I propose to bring this question of the decline in, and variation in the distribution of, the popu-lation to the notice of the Government Departments concerned, and to recommend that it should be taken into account in arriv-ing at the formula for the distribution of the grants for the grant period beginning on 1st April, 1937.38. It seems probable that representations on the question of rates will be made to the Royal Commissions which are at present sitting to consider the broader aspects of local govern-ment at Merthyr Tydfil and on the Tyneside. If so, the reports of these two bodies will, no doubt, throw further light on what is an extremely complicated problem.Grants to Industrial Development Councils39. There have been in existence for some years a number of Development Councils which were started primarily as Publicity Committees at health resorts. Later they extended their activities to industrial development. The finance of these local bodies is largely provided by local authorities under the Local Authorities Publicity Act, 1931. This Act authorises any Borough or Urban District to contribute up to the limit of the value of a half-penny rate to an approved organisation estab-lished for collecting and collating information in regard to the British Isles and disseminating that information outside the Brtish Isles. The dissemination of the information abroad is carried out by the Travel and Industrial Development Associa-tion, which is the organisation approved by the Government for this purpose.40. In South Wales and Monmouthshire there has been in existence for some years an Industrial Development Council covering most of the Special Areas in that neighbourhood. It has done useful work within the limits of its abilities. The finance available has, however, been greatly limited, and I was approached by the Council with a request for financial assistance to help on their work in various directions. I have now offered the Council grants totalling  9,500. An amount not exceed-ing  2,500 is to be devoted to a special investigation into processes for the treatment of South Wales coal with the ultimate object of recommending a suitable scheme or schemes for the up-grading of coal and the production of oils and of preparing estimates for the capital cost of establishing schemes of this character. This particular problem is complicated in South Wales by the great variation in the types of coal available in
the area which run from bituminous coal in the Eastern areas to anthracite in the Western part of the district. An amount of  2,000 is to be devoted to a special survey of the area, which will bring up-to-date and develop in greater detail the work done in 1931 for the Board of Trade by the University College in South Wales and Monmouthshire. The remaining  5,000 is for the general work of the Development Council in collecting and collating information as to the industries and other resources of the area and for general propaganda in this country including films and other publicity. The limits of the Special Areas Act preclude me from giving assistance for publicity abroad.41. In the North-Eastern area there have been a number of District Boards including the Tyneside Industrial Development Conference and the Tees District Development Board. Efforts had been made previously to establish a Joint Board for the whole of the area, and I am glad to say that at the beginning of this year these efforts were successful and the North-East Development Board was instituted. I have promised the Board a grant up to a limit of  9,500 to assist their work. This will include an industrial survey of the area with objects similar to that of the survey for South Wales, that is to say, to continue and develop further the work done for the Board of Trade in 1931. In this area also an additional District Board has been formed for South West Durham. Having regard to the special disabilities under which that part of the area is suffering, I am arranging for part of the grant to the North-East Board to be allocated specially to the South West Durham Board.42. The position in West Cumberland unfortunately is less developed. There has been in existence a Development Com-mittee for the District of Whitehaven, and I have impressed upon the local authorities the necessity for forming a repre-sentative Development Board and have promised that, if such a Board is constituted, I will give them financial assistance. I am glad to say that steps are now being taken to form such a Board, and it is hoped that it will be in a position to function at an early date.Undertakings not carried on for profit43. The Special Areas Act enables financial assistance to be given to any undertaking carried on with the primary object of providing means of livelihood for the persons engaged in the undertaking with a view to their establishment in a position of independence or partial independence of unemploy-ment assistance or poor relief. Two such undertakings have come to my notice, one in Wales and one in Durham, and the position of both these concerns has been strengthened by the allocation of small grants.
The enterprise in South Wales has been in operation for some years at Brynmawr and is directed by Mr. Peter Scott. This society has produced furniture and boots on a co-operative basis, and it has enabled a small number of the unemployed in one of the most hard hit areas of South Wales to attain a measure of self-support. In the Boot section, like most undertakings of this nature, it is found difficult to compete with organised in-dustry, but the Furniture section is producing goods for a special market. Its progress has also been hampered by heavy financial burdens in respect of initial capital expenditure. I therefore felt justified in giving a grant of  4,000 with a view to an extension of the activities of the scheme.The other undertaking is known as the Northern Industries Bureau and is under the direction of Lady Headlam. Here women are given employment in the production of quilting and other handicrafts, and assistance is being given towards the cost of an organiser, whose salary and expenses are being met for two years up to a maximum of  600 per annum.Films44. In May, a British Film Company asked for advice and guidance in connection with a proposed film requiring scenes from a derelict mining area. With the active co-operation of the District Commissioner for South Wales, arrangements were made for the scenes to be taken at a disused coal mine at Blaina in Monmouthshire. Local unemployed men were engaged as &quot; supers &quot;, and the filming extended over six days. From the Company&apos;s point of view, the effort was a great success, and, since a good deal of expenditure in the Special Areas was in-volved, including a substantial sum in wages, it was in my opinion a useful, though small, piece of work.PART IIIPUBLIC   WORKS Public Works Policy Relief Work Schemes45. The appointment of Commissioners undoubtedly gave rise to hopes in many quarters that the policy of the present Govern-ment in regard to works for the relief of unemployment was to be revised and a large number of schemes put in hand to give employment either in the Special Areas themselves or for men drawn from these Areas. My own views on works of public utility are given in the Conclusion of this Report. It is sufficient here to point out that the provision of employment in the Special Areas is not mentioned as one of the Commissioners&apos; duties in the Special Areas Act, and in any event the limitations of their powers, described in paragraph 6 of this Report, would prevent
anything effective being done to give employment on a large scale in the time available.46. There is, in my view, no justification for spending money without resultant economic value, merely to provide employ -ment. The amount which would be required to be spent in order to bring about any material reduction in unemployment in the Special Areas could wisely be spent with infinitely greater ad-vantage in other directions. The Unemployment Grants Com-mittee in their Final Report covering the period 1920-1932 estimated that a capital expenditure of  1,000,000 provided direct employment for about 2,500 men for a year. In addition, a considerable amount of indirect employment was provided. As a rough estimate, one may accept the figure of 4,000 &quot;. man-years &quot; of labour, direct or indirect, resulting from an expendi-ture of  1,000,000. This figure was quoted in the White Paper on the Relief of Unemployment issued in December, 1930 and repeated in the Report of the May Committee (para. 358). Much of the indirect employment is provided outside the area of the particular scheme. It may, therefore, be estimated that to reduce unemployment by 50,000 in the Special Areas for the period of the Commissioners&apos; appointment would involve an ex-penditure of the order of  35,000,000. At the end of the period the areas would possess a large number of public works, many requiring fairly heavy maintenance charges, but the great majority of the men would again be without employment, and littie, if any, permanent improvement would have been effected in the industrial position of the areas.Decision to assist only works with economic or social value47. For these reasons it was decided to assist only such works as could be definitely shown to have value in facilitating the economic development or social improvement of the Areas. While the provision of employment has in itself some social value in helping to counteract the depressing effect of long-continued unemployment, it has not been treated as a controlling factor in determining the merits of any scheme, but has been subordinated to the obtaining of value for work as above.stated. Subject to the fulfilment of this definite policy, a considerable number of public works which were likely to effect permanent improvement of an economic or social nature in the areas have been prosecuted.Procedure48. It was necessary at an early stage to determine whether such works should be carried out directly under the Com-missioner or through local authorities. Much thought was given to this question and. it was finally decided that the most ex-peditious and efficient method was to operate through the local authorities.  The main reasons for this decision were :  
(1) Local authorities clearly hoped and expected that they would be entrusted with the execution of schemes in their respective areas. They possessed the necessary technical &apos; staff for preparation of plans and supervision of work, and further they had far greater knowledge of local conditions than any ad hoc organisation could possibly obtain in the time. Moreover, interest in local affairs would be stimulated by entrusting the work to local authorities.(2) If the work had been carried out directly by the Com-missioner, it would have been necessary to establish an elaborate and costly Headquarter organisation with a full complement of architects, engineers, surveyors, accountants, etc. This would have involved considerable delay, and it would have been difficult to establish a really efficient organisation when no one could have been offered an appointment for more than about two years.(3) Most of the works to be undertaken, e.g. sewerage, water supply and construction of hospitals, were intimately con-nected with local government; their maintenance would de-volve on the local authority, which would therefore in any case have had to be consulted at every stage. Some of the works involve the exercise of powers which local authorities alone possess.(4) The Ministry of Health, which has had long experience in supervising local authorities&apos; schemes and had already ex-amined many of the schemes, which it was desired to put into operation, were prepared to assist the Commissioner to the utmost of their power in regard to both advice and technical supervision. This made it possible to ensure that proposals from local authorities received the necessary ex-pert examination with the minimum of delay.Reasons for delay49. Before public works are put in hand inevitably some time must be spent in detailed technical examination of the proposals in order to ensure that the money shall be wisely spent on sound schemes, and mistakes avoided. Most laymen and, may I add, some politicians do not appreciate the reasons for this unavoidable-able delay, which is caused by the necessity for examining schemes both locally and at Headquarters. Steps have been taken in co-operation with the Ministry of Health to reduce the time spent in examination of proposals to the minimum, but I would ask those who have criticised the apparent delay in getting public works started to remember that essential technical details must first be made available. For instance, in the case of a sewage scheme with a sea out-fall, tidal observations ex-tending over a period of from three to six months are necessary.
It is only by a thorough preparation of the ground and proceed-ing by orderly and businesslike methods that mistakes can be avoided.Measures outside the Special Areas50. By Section 1 (6) of the Special Areas Act the Com-missioners are enabled to initiate, organise, prosecute and assist measures outside the Special Areas in so far as such measures may afford employment or occupation for substantial numbers of persons from those areas. This sub-section was debated at some length during the passage of the Bill and Mr. Stanley, then Minister of Labour, gave certain pledges which materially restricted the Commissioners&apos; powers in regard to schemes for giving employment outside the Areas. Nevertheless consider-able thought has been given to the possibility of initiating some schemes of this type, particularly schemes of public utility which would have a lasting value and improve the economic resources of the Country. One scheme to which special attention was given was the partial reclamation of the Wash, and thanks are due to the Ministry of Agriculture for the help given in examina-tion of this question. Unfortunately this proposal, like most other important works of public utility, could only be under-taken successfully by a programme lasting over a number of years. The two and a half years of the Commissioners&apos; official existence are altogether too short to justify me in attempting to undertake such works myself, and I could find no satisfactory organisation prepared to make itself responsible, with initial assistance from the Special Areas. Fund, for the reclamation of the Wash and the development of the land reclaimed.51. Most schemes of this nature, such as the construction of arterial roads, bridges and tunnels, would in the ordinary course be undertaken by the local authorities concerned, who would have to maintain such works, and, while I should deprecate a return to the policy of financing schemes primarily in order to give employment, I would gladly have approached the Govern-ment for authority to give grants to authorities to assist in much needed schemes such as the tunnel under the Thames near Purfleet, the construction of an orbital road round London or of a bridge over the Severn at Chepstow, had I not been de-barred by the interpretation put on the word &quot; payable &quot;, as explained in paragraph 6 (4) above. It would, of course, have been a condition that a large proportion of the labour and materials would have come from the Special Areas, but I have reason to believe that that condition would not have prevented the local authorities concerned from co-operating with me in works of great national value which would have given employ-ment for several years to substantial numbers of unemployed men from the SpecialAreas.30564 jj
52. As a result of the short tenure of my own office and the limitations imposed by the Special Areas Act on my power to give grants to local authorities, I have found it impossible to initiate any schemes of public utility outside the Special Areas though, as indicated in paragraph -103 (3),-I am financing a number of schemes of land settlement in the South of England for families drawn from the Special Areas. I have, however, made representations to the appropriate Government Depart-ments with regard to schemes that offered opportunity for em-ployment of men from the Special Areas. For instance, I have urged the desirability of employing such men in the construction of the new aerodromes and aircraft bases necessitated by the ex-expansion of the Royal Air Force, and also in connection with the further electrification of the London transport system which is to be undertaken with the aid of Government credit. In both cases I am assured that my representation will result in consider-able employment of men from the Special Areas.53. I particularly regret my inability to assist the Gloucester-shire County Council in the construction of a road bridge over the Severn. This proposal would not only give employment to considerable numbers of unemployed Welsh miners; it would open a gateway to South Wales and lead materially to its economic development, particularly for tourist traffic in respect of which Wales offers great opportunities. I have had to con-tent myself with urging that sympathetic consideration should be given to the scheme.Works of Public Utility undertaken by local authoritiesTypes of Schemes54. The schemes of public work in respect of which it has been found possible to make grants to local authorities fall into two main classes, viz. amenity schemes having an economic value and public health schemes.55. As regards amenity schemes, local authorities were in-formed at the beginning of March that such schemes, to be eligible for approval, must provide for the improvement of sites in such a manner as to bring increased economic or industrial value to the locality.56. As regards public health schemes, local authorities were notified at the same time that schemes of sewerage or other public health services which it was necessary to execute on urgent grounds of public health, would be considered. This was amplified at the beginning of June when local authorities were informed that grants would be available in respect of approved schemes for the provision of new, or the extension or alteration of existing, hospitals, out-patient departments and maternity and child welfare clinics.   At the same time it was announced
that schemes for the provision of open-air swimming baths would be entertained.57. It was made clear fp the local authorities that I should require to be satisfied that the various schemes would have a lasting value; that they could not be undertaken without financial assistance; and that the authorities could afford to maintain the works when completed.     &apos; ;Cost of Schemes for which assistance has been promised58. Details of the 53 schemes in respect of which I have promised assistance are given in AppendixVTII of. this Report. The total estimated cost amounts to  900,750, made up as follows:  Public Health: HospitalsSewerage      ...      ...      ......Water ...Site reclamation clearance and improvement 900,750Particulars of Certain Schemes59. Of the schemes under consideration, or already approved for grant, the following particulars relate to four of the more important: -Glamorgan County Hospital. The scheme of the Glamorgan County Council provides for the construction at an estimated cost of  250,000 of an up-to-date and much needed general hospital of 300 beds, under the administration of the County Council. All types of urgent medical and surgical cases will be received for diagnosis and treatment. Whilst the final allocation of beds has not been definitely decided upon, it is contemplated that the Maternity Block will provide accommodation &apos; for 40 patients and that of the remainder of the accommodation of 260 beds about two-thirds will be for surgical and one-third for medical cases.East Gateshead Clearance Scheme.- This scheme, the esti-mated cost of which, excluding the purchase price, amounts to  17,000, provides for the clearance and levelling of sites of approximately 128 acres on the bank of the River Tyne. These sites are at present covered with the remains of de-molished buildings, slag heaps and chemical refuse. The appearance is most unsightly and a large amount of excava-tion and levelling is necessary before any new buildings can be erected.  When this work has been completed, the approach30564 B 2 257,000 423,850 110,300 209,600
2*K ^to the town from the cast will be greatly improved, and . excellent sites-will- be available ior industrial redevelopment. A scheme submitted by the Waste Lands Committee of the Tyneside Council of Social Service for the clearance of adjoin-ing sites is also&apos; under consideration.:&apos;1South Shields River Banks Development Scheme. This scheme provides for the clearance of a site - of 35 acres at the mouth of the Tync, with a river frontage of approximately 1,500 yards, and originally included proposals for the con-struction of a. light railway, two road approaches, a deep water quay and the levelling1 of a mountainous slag heap to form a site for a dry dock. .&apos;&apos; :.The provisions of the Special Areas Act precluded the giv-1 ing of assistance to those parts of the scheme which related to the railway and roads, and it was considered that for the present,, at any rate, it would be desirable for the construc-tion of the quay and the preparation of a site for a dry dock to be deferred, as the prospect of its being required appeared nebulous.   The Council, however, are prepared themselves to find the money for the road and railway works, and a grant, will be made from the Special Areas Fund in aid of the balance &apos; of the cost of the &quot;approved part of the scheme, which is estimated to amount to between  701,000 and  90,000.. The scheme is being dealt with in two stages, and tenders have already been invited, in respect of the first part, the estimated cost of which is  15,400.  Further consideration is being given to the question of constructing the quay.Maryport Coast Protection and Development Scheme.  This scheme, estimated on the preenst basis to cost about  30,000, provides for the construction of a sea-wall to pro-tect the coast at a local beauty spot known as &quot; The Brows.&quot; The Council propose, to acquire land at the back of the line of the contemplated wall, and the. question of the further development of this land is at present under consideration. The industrial prospects of Maryport are far from bright; the future for the town, appears to lie in developing tourist traffic to the attractive but little developed coast-line to the north. In the meantime the Council have, been - asked to obtain a report from a Consulting Engineer on technical matters relat-ing to the construction of the protective sea-wall.Variety of schemes60. It will be seen from Appendix VIII that the schemes differ widely both in character and extent. On the public health side they provide for the improvement of the existing sanitary ser-vices, and also for increased facilities for the diagnosis and treatment of disease, and should, in conjunction with the oppor-tunity for healthy exercise in the fresh air which will be afforded
by open-air swimming baths, do much to improve the standard of health in the areas. Provision is also made for site improve-ment schemes which, it is hoped, may attract industrial enter-prises to the areas. In suitable localities, the improvement and protection of sea fronts in order to encourage the tourist industry are provided for. Recreation grounds and parks, not forming part of a site improvement scheme with an-economic or indus-trial development value, have been ruled out for assistance on the basis of a wage paid scheme. I deal in Part V of the Report with the provision of recreation grounds on the basis of a Volun-tary (Local Amenities) Scheme.Maintenance -   - . .61. It will be observed that local authorities have been required to - meet the maintenance costs resulting from - any schemes carried out and that no provision has been made to assist them in this respect. I do. not consider that the Special Areas Fund should be made available for the purpose of meeting any part of the ordinary, maintenance expenditure of local authorities including, under&apos; this head, ordinary renewals, and accordingly I have ruled out proposals of this type. The problem oi those authorities, whose financial position is so grave that there is some doubt as to their power to continue to meet their day to day commitments, is a- separate question not related to the Special Areas Fund. It is observed that the Government have already instituted enquiries which bear on this question in two of the most heavily rated areas. !&apos; ...Schemes under consideration62. Amongst the schemes which have been brought to my notice bat on which it has not yet been possible for decisions to be reached are three sewerage schemes of considerable magnitude-tude. One raises the question of the unification of the Tyneside sewerage system; one is the Mid-Glamorgan scheme, which it is proposed shall replace the existing schemes of the Bridgend, Maesteg, and Ogmore and Garw Urban District Councils and the Penybont Rural District Council.. The other is a large sewerage scheme in Monmouthshire.63. For many years local opinion has been divided as to the effect on the public health of the pollution of the tidal portion of the River Tyne, which results from the discharge into the River, in an untreated condition, of domestic as well as industrial sewage. A tentative scheme to deal with domestic sewage only, and very roughly estimated to cost  3,500,000, was drawn up some years ago and the whole question was discussed by re-presentatives of the local authorities concerned, but no definite action was decided upon. My attention was drawn to the question by the Northumberland County Council, and after carefully considering it in consultation with the various Govern-30564- b 3
ment Departments concerned I came to the conclusion that no further action on my part could be justified until an opinion had been obtained from an impartial and authoritative body whether the condition of the tidal portion of the fiver is so injurious or dangerous to the public health as to require a comprehensive scheme to ameliorate it. Accordingly I informed the Northumberland County Council at the end of May that I should be prepared, to appoint a small independent Committee for this purpose and to bear the whole of the cost involved by the Com-mittee&apos;s inquiry. As, however,, the Committee&apos;s work could only be satisfactorily carried out if the wholehearted co-operation of all the local authorities concerned is secured, it seemed to be necessary in the first place to ask the County Council to obtain the views of the local authorities on this aspect, and this is now being done.64. The estimated cost of the Mid-Glamorgan sewerage scheme has been placed at  350,000. In this case the available information was not sufficient to indicate whether the problem would best be solved by the joint scheme which had been out-lined or by individual schemes, or by a combination of both. Accordingly I asked the Councils concerned to appoint a Con-suiting Engineer to investigate and report. This has been done and when the report is available the question will be further considered.Investigations are also in progress regarding a proposed sewer-age scheme of some magnitude for the Eastern valleys in Monmouthshire.Proportion of grant to cost of scheme65. With regard to the proportion of grant made to the total cost of a scheme, it has been necessary to deal with each case on its merits. Much depends on the type of scheme, its magnitude-tude and the financial position of the authority concerned. I have endeavoured to balance the scales as fairly as possible. There has been a tendency in some quarters to regard the exist-ence of the Special Areas Fund as replacing the necessity for any call on the ratepayers in respect of new works regardless of the financial position of the authority and the extent to which in the past it has met its reasonable obligations. This view cannot be accepted, and I consider that, in as much as the schemes, towards the cost of which I am prepared to make a grant, have a definite economic or health value, local authorities should be prepared to make a contribution within their means. I appreciate that the financial position of certain authorities is much worse than others, but in general I have required local authorities to bear from the irates a definite proportion of the cost of all grant-aided schemes. On the other hand, whilst it is clearly not possible for me to ignore the present financial position
j8?nof the authority when deciding the percentage of grant to be made, I do not overlook the sense of injustice and hardship that would be rightly aroused if I paid no regard to the fact that some authorities are in a relatively more advantageous financial position, due to their more careful and prudent administration in the past, than others, who are now at the end of their financial resources and to whom I am bound to give a high per-centage of grant if a scheme is to proceed at all. As far as is practicable,. I have recognised good administration, and I have on occasions given assistance to authorities for schemes which strictly speaking it might have been within their unaided financial competence to carry out.Assistance given by Ministry of Health66. In considering whether I should be justified in supporting schemes submitted to me by local authorities and in deciding upon the proportion of grant to be given, I desire to recognise the valuable assistance cordially given to me by the administra-tive and technical staff of the Ministry of Health. This assist-ance has enabled me to deal with the many proposals submitted far more rapidly and effectively than would have been the case had I constituted a special staff for the purpose.Labour Policy   &apos;67. As regards labour policy, I have thought it right to attach the following conditions when making grants:  (1) Labour to be recruited from the Employment Exchange; preference being given to married men over 35 years of age;(2) Regard to be paid to local conditions of working, but normally the ordinary working-day will be one of 8 hours. No work to be carried out on Saturdays except, when it is practicable, to make up for time lost earlier in the week owing to bad weather or other unavoidable causes.(3) The wages paid to be those normally applicable to work of similar type, i.e. in civil engineering works, the working rule agreement of the Civil Engineering Construction Board to apply.These conditions are designed to secure that, subject to their suitability, preference for employment is given to local unem-ployed persons most in need of work; secondly, that no en-encouragement is given to the younger and single men to remain in the Special Areas when they would be better occupied either in attempting to obtain a job in a relatively prosperous area or in making themselves fitter for such a job by a course at a Instructional or Training Centre, and thirdly that by restricting the weekly hours of work to 40 an increased number of men are employed. Further, these reduced hours are better suited to men out of condition,30*6f B 4
Except in the case of large building schemes such as hospitals and of work of a highly technical nature such as the reinforced concrete work in connection with the provision of swimming baths, it is open to local authorities to propose that the work should be carried out by their direct labour organisation. Where the work is so carried out arrangements have been made to secure that it is organised on a businesslike footing under super-vision. Where it is carried out by contract it is necessary to allow a slight relaxation of the recruitment condition in order to allow the Contractor to use his own staff of supervisors, and key men. The number of men recruited outside the Employment Exchange Service must not, however, exceed 15 per cent.Housing68. The overcrowding problem in the Special Areas in : the North East is acute, and there is a pressing need for more houses to be let at low rents. Such rents can only be secured if the Exchequer subsidies provided by the Housing Act, 1930, or the Bill now before Parliament are made available, but, owing to the fact that the payment of Exchequer subsidy in respect of bouses built by the authorities themselves is conditional upon the local authority making a contribution from the rates, many of the local authorities, owing to their straitened financial circum-stances, will find it difficult to comply with this condition and so obtain the advantage of the Exchequer subsidy.Both the 1930 Act and the Bill, however, permit of the forma-tion of a Public Utility Society, which, in co-operation with a local authority, can build houses to accommodate families dis-placed as the result of action taken by the authority to eradicate slums or to abate overcrowding, and houses so built attract the normal Exchequer subsidy. This is paid through the autho-rity, who are not required to make a contribution from the rates. Accordingly, arrangements are being made to promote a Public. Utility Society to build houses in the Special Areas in the North East in co-operation with the local authorities. I propose to make a contribution to the:Society, in respect of each house built, of a capital sum. which would be sufficient to enable the house to be let at the rent which would have been charged had the house been built by the local authority. These arrangements were finally settled at the beginning of June, and I am now in communication with influential persons in the North East Area with a view to the formation of a Society, the Executive Com-mittee of which will be composed of members who, I trust, are likely to command the confidence of the local authorities with whom they will work.In present circumstances, the lines I have indicated above pro-vide the simplest method of dealing with the problem of over-crowding in the North East, but they call for the whole-hearted
co-operation of the local authorities. The evils of overcrowding are so great and affect the lives of such large numbers of families in Durham and on the Tyneside that I look forward to a ready response to the appeal which I shall shortly be making to prominent men and to local authorities to co-operate with me in this aspect of my work.Other Works of Public Utility69. All the works of public utility mentioned in paragraphs 54 to 67 are under the direction of the local authorities con-cerned. I am, however, enabled by the Special Areas Act to give financial assistance to other undertakings not carried on for the purpose of gain, and among such undertakings are a number of statutory bodies. In certain cases it was found that these bodies were prevented from putting in hand necessary develop-ments in their area through lack of means, and in three cases where such improvements were in my view calculated to lead to the economic development of the area I have been able to encourage such improvement by the offer of financial assistance.Provision of deep water quay on the South Bank of the River Tyne70. I have offered to the Tyne Improvement Commission a grant of one-third of the cost of the construction of a Deep Water Quay, with a depth alongside of 35 feet at low water, on the South Bank of the Tyne in the vicinity of Tyne Dock. The scheme would provide, within three miles of the open sea, facili-ties such as do not exist at present on our East Coast for very large ships. They would, I am convinced, be of great value both to the area and to the country. The total cost of the work is estimated at about  750,000.The scheme, which is a substitute for the much discussed and more costly Jarrow Slake Scheme, involves a settlement with the London &amp; North Eastern Railway Company regarding the disposal of the present Tyne Dock. The present position is that the Tyne Improvement Commission have made the Railway Company an offer for the purchase of this dock which the Rail-way Company have not seen their way to accept. There is unfortunately, therefore, a deadlock at the moment, but I am looking into the matter further to see if an acceptable solution can be found.Improvement of Whitehaven Harbour71. The desirability of improving this harbour was referred to in Sir John Davidson&apos;s Report of last year on the conditions in West Cumberland and an investigation, was carried out on my behalf by the Harbour Engineer of the Ministry of Transport. After consideration of his Report, I made a conditional offer of  100,000 to the Whitehaven Harbour Commissioner for km
improvements to the harbour. The Harbour Commissioners did not: feel able to accept the terms of the offer, and the whole matter is being re-examined with a view to assessing the increased trade likely to accrue and ascertaining if a practicable and acceptable scheme can be prepared.Maryport Harbour72. The trade of this harbour has fallen very considerably in recent years and owing to the loss of revenue it has not been possible to provide for the adequate maintenance of the under-taking, with the result that the harbour is becoming badly silted up. It seemed to me essential that the harbour should be kept open both in the interests of the town and to assure continued employment at-certain coal mines, whose output is exported through Maryport. Consideration has been given to the amount of grant to be offered, and to the purpose for which it should be used. I have offered to pay for dredging the harbour up to a limit of cost of about  4,000. This will keep the harbour open for a few years and furnish an opportunity for considering the future of the undertaking.Pit DrainageThe problem in South Wales73. In the year 1924, owing to the closing of certain collieries on the Northern outcrop of the South Wales Coalfield, large areas of workings became water-logged, and the position is becoming increasingly menacing, particularly on the North, East and Southern limits of the outcrop.Briefly described the South Wales Coalfield is shaped rather like a dish, in the centre of which the deep.and most important workings are situated. It will be appreciated, therefore, that as the outcrops and the higher workings become waterlogged the menace to the lower workings is increased. There are at present along the Northern outcrop and in the East and Southern out-crops Collieries that have been abandoned and are now filled, or filling, with water. The filling of the old workings with water entails considerable danger to workings in the dip; besides making it necessary to leave very considerable barriers of coal for reasons of safety.The economic aspect has to be considered, i.e. the possible loss by inundation and the actual loss of coal left in the barriers. These are estimated to contain some 35,000,000 tons of coal; an estimate that must, as time goes on, be revised because of the steady encroachment of water on the present live workings.74. Proposals were developed for dealing with the water problem and in particular a scheme of free drainage was drawn up-and discussed with the South Wales Coal Owners.
In 1934, the President of the South Wales Institute of Engineers (Mr. J. Macleod Carey), who had previously drawn attention to this danger placed a detailed scheme publicly before the Institute. Subsequently a meeting was held at the Mines Department in London when Mr. Evan Williams (now Sir Evan Williams) drew the attention of the Secretary for Mines (Mr. Ernest Brown, M.P.): to the serious position in the coalfield created by the dangers to which the President of the Institute had drawn attention, and expressed the view on behalf of the Coal Owners that something should be done to meet it.75. The Secretary for Mines proposed that the Coal Owners should set up a Committee of Enquiry. This was done, and an Engineer (Mr. Llewellyn Jacob) was appointed to report to them. This he did at the beginning of the present year, and in his report he upheld the contentions set forth by the President of the Institute, and agreed that a serious situation would arise unless preventative measures were taken. He agreed that a free drainage scheme was a practical proposal, and superior to any alternative method that had been put to him.76. The scheme proposed by Mr. Macleod Carey consisted, in brief, of the driving of two main free drainage water courses, one from Aberdare to catch the North Eastern outcrop water of the coalfield with an outfall in the River Usk, near Newport; and the other to be driven from Llwynypia with an outfall at the River Ewenny, on the South coast of Glamorganshire.77. The cost of these two free drainage levels was estimated to be, for the Easterly adit  934,060 and for the Westerly adit  478,470, a total of  1,412,530. ft was thought that the schemes would solve the water problem for all time along the Northern and Eastern regions Of the coalfield.78. It has been roughly estimated that the driving of two such tunnels would employ approximately 2,000 men for a period of from four to five years, in addition to the necessary technical and supervisory staff&apos;. The maintenance of the adits, if and when completed, would also necessitate the employment per-manently Of a suitable staff, with a gang of fifty to sixty work-men.79. It is not suggested that by this means the whole of the present pumping costs which have to be borne by the Colliery Companies to-day would be saved, but that the saving would represent approximately 80 per cent; It is understood that for power, Wages and stores alone, the cost of pumping in the year 1929 to one Company with Collieries in the Aberdare and Rhymney Valleys amounted to about  73^000 per annum, whilst at another Colliery Company in Monmouthshire the cost is  30,000 per annum. It will thus be seen that substantial savings should be available to set against the interest and sinking fund charges on the necessary capital outlay.
Action Taken80. In March pf this year, I met representatives of the Mon-mouthshire and South Wales Coal Owners Association with re-gard to the proposed drainage schemes, It was explained to me that the Coal Owners were not unanimous as to the need for any drainage scheme, and those who did favour the proposal could not see how the Coal Owners could raise the necessary capital, having regard to the financial and economic state of the in-dustry. I was informed that the views of the individual Coal Owners concerned were being obtained and the Association promised to let me have a report on the scheme by the end of June.I regard this question as one of vital importance in relation to the future economic development of South Wales and I am anxiously awaiting the promised report. The livelihood of a million people may be jeopardised. I hope to deal with the matter further in my next Report.The Problem in Durham81. There is a somewhat similar problem in the Durham coal-field, as mentioned in Captain Euan Wallace&apos;s Report. The matter here is still under investigation by the interests principally concerned with a view to finding a practical solution.Summer Camps for Military Training82. In February, the suggestion was made to me that the establishment of new summer Military Training Camps in the Special Areas would assist those areas in several ways, e.g. by stimulating local trade and employment and by attracting re-cruits from the areas. I, therefore, consulted Lord Hailsham, the Secretary of State for War, who at once showed his sympathy by agreeing to explore the possibility of setting up Military Camps in the Special Areas in the summer of 1935.It was found possible to arrange for a Camp for one Infantry Brigade, one Field Brigade R.A. and attached troops to be held in the vicinity of Tow Law, County Durham, for a period of one month during August and September, 1935. The cost of pre-paring the site, providing drains, laying on water and erecting some of the buildings, will be met from the Special Areas Fund up to a maximum of  1,500.The question of providing additional Camps in the Special Areas in 1936 is being actively pursued.
3-part IV ;&apos;AGRICULTURELand Settlement: Some preliminary considerations83. I now come to the plans for providing opportunities for unemployed persons to cultivate the land. It is generally agreed that land settlement presents a means of dealing with unemploy-ment by taking men out of the industrial&apos;field and: giving them an opportunity of making a living. It is indeed sometimes advocated as the main solution for the unemployment problem but, though within certain limits it offers possibilities which ought to be tried out to a greater extent than has hitherto been the case, economic conditions in this country will not in my opinion enable very large numbers of workers to be taken out of the field of industrial employment.84. This is not the occasion on which to set out.at length the more fundamental difficulties connected with the settlement of men on the land such as the fall in the price of agricultural produce and the political&apos; and economic reactions to a policy of high protective duties on imported foodstuffs. It is, how-ever, necessary to remember that agricultural work is a vocation calling not only for a high degree of skill but also for special characteristics not associated in general with an industrial out-look. Both the settler and his wife must be of the type likely to make a success of agricultural life. The environment in which the work is carried out, away from the big towns and the ameni-ties and amusements therein available, the unremitting toil, the need for patience and fortitude to face losses inflicted by forces outside the cultivator&apos;s control, and the relatively small and irregular return, are considerations which render the life attracted-tive only to a small minority and make it vital to pick and choose with the greatest care when selecting prospective smallholders from amongst persons who are substantially ignorant of agri-cultural life.85. Moreover, real difficulty is anticipated in acquiring for substantial numbers of unemployed a sufficient area of suitable land which is not at present being cultivated either by small-holders or as large farms employing agricultural labourers. Even for the relatively small requirements of the earliest stages of my plans, properties have been brought to my notice which, if purchased and settled with smallholders, would have involved the immediate displacement of an undue number of persons com-parable to the number of incoming smallholders.86. This indication of some of the difficulties involved is suffi-cient to show that the question of land settlement must neces-sarily be approached with caution and carefully/thought out
experiments made. What is called for is a combination of bold-ness in experiment and care iri execution. There is a real necessity for the Government to help the unemployed men placed on the land under these early experiments to overcome the in-inevitable difficulties. It must be recognised that the unemployed men to be settled on the land under these schemes have no capital of their own, and the State in advancing the capital must be prepared to regard some of the advance as a free grant and to provide the balance of it on generous terms which will not make the settler feel when he is embarking on his new career that he is saddled with an impossible load of debt. Moreover, Government policy should be framed so as to give as much pro-tectiori as possible to the product of the smallholdings which are to be created.87. If these provisions are made I am satisfied that, provided the schemes are started in a cautious way, and careful regard is paid to the type of produce to be grown, the training to be given, the suitability of the land and its proximity to good markets, there should be reasonable chance of success, and it is with these considerations in mind that I have approved the plans for settlement set out below.The effect of the Unemployment Act, 193488. Before passing to the actual description of the schemes, the change in circumstances and the increased opportunities brought about by the passage of the Unemployment Act, 1934, and the powers thereunder of the Unemployment Assistance Board, should be explained. It has been possible for many years for County Councils to provide smallholdings to be let to suitable tenants at a fair rent. But the tenant has always been required to provide his own working capital which included, of course, the sum required to maintain his family until the cultivation of his holding was sufficiently far advanced to pro-vide for him and his family with,a livelihood. Moreover, in order to avoid the risk of loss, the County Councils have in their own interests naturally required that their smallholding tenants should satisfy them that they are persons who have had previous experience of agricultural work and are likely to make good on their holdings. With the advent of the Unemployment Assistance Board and its powers under the Unemployment Act, 1934, it is possible for the Board to establish training courses in agricultural Work, or to pay training allowances to persons within their scdpe who are attending approved courses of train-ing. The practical effect of these powers is that, working in conjunction with the Board, I have been able to obtain their sanction that the first year&apos;s. work on a smallholdings scheme shall be a, training period with skilled supervision and iristruc-tioh and that during this period the Board will be prepared to
approve the payment of training allowances. The.result is that at one and the same time the maintenance of the trainee and his family will be assured, the cultivation of his smallholding will be brought nearer to the point at which it ought to be self-supporting, and the trainee himself will learn his job as a small-holder so that at the end of the training period he can stand on his own feet. During the training period there will be no con-contractual relationship between the trainee and the particular organisation administering the settlement scheme concerned, and the net proceeds will be retained by the organisation but can be divided amongst the trainees on the satisfactory completion of their training. At the end of the training period trainees who are satisfactory will be given a tenancy of their holding at a fair rent. These arrangements, together with the provision from the Special Areas Fund, partly by gift and partly by loan, of the whole of the working capital required, make it possible for the first time to settle on the land unemployed persons with no resources of their own and without any previous experience of cultivating the soil as a full-time occupation.Three types of Scheme89. The actual schemes, which except to a small extent in respect of allotments provide only for unemployed persons, fall into three distinct categories :  -(1) settlement on small holdings large enough to afford an independent livelihood to their occupiers;(2) formation of &quot; group holdings &quot; by which are meant plots up to a quarter or half an acre of land per man cultivated by men working in groups of about 20.(3) the extension of the movement for cultivating allotments.General position in regard to Small Holdings90. As regards smallholdings, a brief survey of the position as it existed at the time of my appointment will help towards a clearer understanding of the measures that have been adopted.91. Under the Small Holdings Acts powers are vested in County Councils and Councils of County Boroughs to provide small holdings for men who possess the necessary experience and sufficient working capital, but the Acts, afford no means whereby prospective tenants of such holdings can obtain financial assist-ance from public funds, either by grant or lqan, for the actual working of their holdings. The possibility, therefore, of any unemployed worker, even if he had the necessary agricultural knowledge, obtaining a County Council small holding was so-re-mote as to be negligible. On the other hand, the Agricultural Land Utilisation Act, 1931, enabled the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to provide small holdings for unemployed persons,
to make advances of working capital and to provide temporary subsistence allowances. The financial crisis, however, led to the decision, on grounds of economy, not to put the Act into operation, and this has not since been modified.92. In the meantime various experiments in the settlement of unemployed persons on the land had been attempted under private auspices. These efforts were sporadic and disconnected and rather lacking in any clear guiding principles. In the summer of 1934, at the instance of Mr. Walter Elliot, Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Land Settlement Association was set up for the purpose of undertaking experiments in the settlement of unemployed persons on the land.. The Association was promised a grant from the Development Commissioners on the basis of 10s. for every  1 contributed privately up to a defined limit, and this grant was subsequently increased to a  1 for  1 grant up to a maximum of  75,000 annually for a period of three years. I was a member of the Association at the outset but resigned on being appointed Commissioner for the Special Areas in England and Wales.93. The powers conferred by the Special Areas Act include the power to make grants or loans to local authorities for the purpose of providing small holdings, and it is expressly provided by Section 5 of the Act that any contribution made by me under this head may be disregarded for the purpose of determining the amount of any contribution to be made by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries towards any loss incurred by a Council in the provision of small holdings. In this connection it may be explained that under the Small Holdings Act, 1926, Councils may submit schemes to the Minister, who may make a contri-bution not exceeding 75 per cent, of the estimated annual loss to be incurred by the Council in carrying out the scheme.The Special Areas Act also expressly authorises the provision of financial assistance to any undertaking carried on with the primary object of providing means of livelihood for the persons engaged in the undertaking with a view to their establishment in a position of independence or partial independence of assist-ance under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1934, or under the enactments relating to the relief of the poor. This made possible the advance of working capital to unemployed persons placed on small holdings.Co-operation with Small Holdings Authorities94. These provisions afforded a basis for co-operation with the small holdings authorities in the Special Areas, and in February last a letter was addressed to the seven County Councils and seven Councils of County Boroughs in those Areas offering the necessary financial assistance if they would exercise their powers under the Small Holdings Acts to settle a number
of unemployed men on the land in their respective Areas. The response to this offer was not encouraging. However, one authority the Durham County Council showed great readiness to co-operate; it had in fact set up a special Com-mittee and prepared schemes in anticipation. In the remaining Counties the position was left rather indefinite, though in some cases the Councils were willing to lend the services of their staff. So far as the County Boroughs are concerned, the non-repre-sentation of agricultural interests on the Councils and the absence of expert agricultural staff, together with the lack of sufficient suitable land within the municipal boundaries, made it unlikely that these authorities could undertake schemes of land settlement. Speaking generally, therefore, except in County Durham, the machinerj/ of the Small Holdings Acts has not as yet been resorted to for the settlement of unem-ployed men and other measures have had to be&apos; adopted. Be-fore referring to these a brief description of the Durham small holdings schemes may be of interest.95. The first of these schemes provided for the purchase of 95 acres of land at Mount Pleasant, Crook, and the settlement thereon of 19 men. This scheme was started in May. All the men are married and are unemployed miners who had made a success of smaller plots, and they live near enough to the land to make it unnecessary to build new houses. The scheme did not therefore involve any loss to the Council or any contribution by the Ministry of Agriculture. But the men had to be pro-vided with working capital and I agreed to advance the necessary amount out of the Special Areas Fund. The work to be undertaken is to consist of combinations of pig keeping, poultry keeping, market gardening and glasshouse cultivation. The average amount of working capital needed was  260.Here was an opportunity under entirely novel circumstances; nothing of the sort had previously been attempted under official auspices and important questions of principle had to be settled. The first of these was the question how much of the amount advanced for working capital should be treated as a loan and how much as a gift. It had to be recognised on the one hand that the men might be assumed to start with practically no re-sources and that to saddle them with heavy repayments would discourage them and endanger their prospects of success. On the other hand any free grant from public funds was unprecedented-cedented and could only be justified by the exceptional conditions of the Special Areas and in so far as it was limited to the amount necessary to ensure reasonable prospects of success. Ultimately il was agreed with the County Council, that a repayment at the rate of 5s. per week commencing with the third year and con-tinuing for ten years should discharge the settlers&apos; liability and that no interest be charged on amounts from time to time out-
standing. This scheme of deferred easy repayments recoups one moiety, or  130 if  260 were advanced.96. With regard to the status of the settlers in respect of un-employment allowances reference has already been made in paragraph 88 to the satisfactory arrangement that has been made with the Unemployment Assistance Board.97. A copy of the Memorandum prepared by the County Council for the guidance of the selected settlers is appended to this Report (Appendix IX).98. The second scheme submitted by the Durham County Council was of a more ambitious character and provided for the purchase of 512 acres of land near Bishop Auckland. The number of holdings to be occupied by unemployed men is 56 ranging from about four to eight acres. Two comparatively large holdings and one market garden holding are to be let, with existing dwelling houses, to ordinary smallholders. Fifty-four new houses are to be built; an existing cottage will go with one of the holdings and one holding is to consist of bare land only. The scheme involves an annual loss amounting at the outset to about  400 towards which the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries has agreed to contribute 75 per cent. The loss will diminish in future years as loans for capital expenditure on the estate are repaid. The rent of house and land, when the trainees enter into occupation, will be  26 a year; house rent will be payable from the commencement of the scheme and rent for fhe, land will commence on completion of training and the grant of tenancies of the holdings.&apos;The.- County Council applied for (a) a grant to meet their share of the annual loss on the scheme and (6) an advance of  14,560 for working capital, being at the rate of  260 per.man for 56 men.I agreed to make a grant of sufficient amount to cover one half of the loss falling on the Council&apos; and to provide the sum required to meet the cost of working capital on the same terms and conditions as in the case of the Mount Pleasant Scheme.The Land Settlement Association99. The setting up of this Association in 1934 has already been mentioned. The gift of an estate at Potton in Bedfordshire made prior to my appointment as Commissioner enabled the Association to make a start early this year, and an arrangement was entered into whereby the Association agreed to settle 40 families from Durham on this property and to undertake five similar schemes for groups of about 40 families each. The terms of the arrangement were that one-third of the cost estimated at about  750 per family would be contributed out of the Special Areas Fund, but would not of course earn for the Association a corresponding amount-of grant from the Development Fund.
By this means 240 families might, it was hoped, be settled at a total cost to the Special Areas Fund of about  60,000.100. The general conditions regarding advances of working capital, and the payment of allowances, etc., are substantially the same for men settled by the Association as those described in paragraphs 95 to 97 of this Report.101.. At the time of rendering this Report, 30 heads of families had actually been transferred from Durham to Potton, and dwelling houses for this number of families were either nearly completed or in course of construction. The Association had also acquired an etsate at Andover for the second of the six settlements it is proposed to establish. The first batch of men for this scheme have already been selected and will be brought down during the summer.Further arrangements made with the Association are referred to in paragraph 103.The proposed Homesteads Trust102. In addition to the measures already described I had in mind from an early stage the possibility of undertaking a scheme of land settlement under my immediate control. The time limit placed by Statute upon the office of Commissioner and certain other considerations led me to consider and take steps to promote the establishment of a Homesteads Trust for England and Wales, whose work would have been supplementary to that of the County Councils and the Land Settlement Association. Such a body would have needed experience and organising ability of an exceptional order, and I was able to secure the services of Lieut. Colonel H. j. Stibbard, O.B:E., as prospective-tive General Manager of the Trust. Lieut. Colonel Stibbard was already well known in connection with the remarkably successful work carried out by him at,the Army Vocational Training Centre at Chisledon, and the Homesteads Trust appeared likely to afford wide scope for his exceptional capacity and energy. The Deeds of the Trust were approaching settlement, and in anticipation of its early establishment I had negotiated on its behalf for the purchase of an estate of about 1,800 acres at Kingston Bagpuize in Berkshire , and Oxfordshire. Lieut. Colonel Stibbard was devoting much thought and labour to the preliminary arrangements when quite suddenly and without any warning his death occurred on 28th April.The loss of Lieut. Colonel Stibbard and a fuller appreciation of certain difficulties which had supervened; led me to reconsider the whole position and I decided to abandon the proposed pur-chase of the Kingston Bagpuize estate and to proceed no further with the formation of the Trust. The estate was transferred to another purchaser on terms which permitted the repayment of the deposit paid by me, together, with all working expenses on
the estate incurred up to the date when my responsibility for the property came to an end.I wish to pay tribute to the valuable work done by Lieut. Colonel Stibbard on which the proposal for the Homesteads Trust was based. Practical experience of training and settle-ment on a large scale is rare, and the work of settling men on the land, which he had so much at heart, has sustained a severe loss.Further co-operation with the Land Settlement Association103. Following the abandonment of the intended purchase of the Kingston Bagpuize estate, an extended arrangement was entered into with the Land Settlement Association, whereby the Association agreed to undertake the settlement of a number of families from the Special Areas in groups of about 40 families in Northumberland and Cumberland and also on estates in Southern England. For each County in which these groups are situated there will be a small Executive Committee, and an Advisory Committee consisting of persons of standing drawn from the locality who are experienced and interested in agri-cultural matters.The detailed arrangements are not yet finally settled, but the position reached to date is as follows:(1) In Cumberland the Association will undertake five schemes comprising 40 families each. It is hoped to secure the co-operation of the Cumberland County Council by the exercise of their powers under the Small Holdings Acts to acquire the land, erect the buildings, and carry out other works. The proposal is that the Association should take a lease of the property required for each scheme and pay the County Council, in addition to the appropriate rent, a capital sum, which will be reimbursed out of the Special Areas Fund, equivalent to one half of the Council&apos;s share of the annual loss of the scheme, after taking account of the contributions payable by the Minister of Agriculture in re-spect of any scheme approved by him. The amount re-quired for the settlers&apos; working capital will also be provided, through the Association, out of the Special Areas Fund.The adoption of this method will greatly reduce the call on the Association^ funds for the inauguration of these schemes though they will not become the owners of estates acquired by this method.(2) In the County of Northumberland and the County Boroughs of Newcastle and Tynemouth the co-operation of the local authorities is being sought on similar lines and negotiations are at present in progress.

Further transference schemes	6 Details not 20	240 200 yet settled. 800The term &apos;&apos; transference scheme &apos;&apos; is used to connote a scheme under which families are settled on estates in counties other than those of which the Special Areas form part. Such schemes will mostly be in the Midlands or South of England.Welsh Land Settlement Trust104. In addition to these arrangements special measures are being adopted in Wales with the object of settling unemployed families from the Welsh mining valleys on grouped small holdings in Wales, the schemes being confined entirely to the Principality. National sentiment in Wales is very strong, and I am satisfied that any scheme of land settlement for Welsh families is much more likely to be successful if undertaken by a body which is predominantly Welsh in character. A Welsh Land Settlement Trust is therefore being constituted under the Chairmanship of Captain Geoffrey Crawshay, the District Com-missioner for South Wales. The Trust will be financed out of the Special Areas Fund and will, it is hoped, undertake a variety of experiments in various forms of settlement on the land. The Deeds of the Trust await final settlement, and in the meantime invitations are about to be issued to those who are to form the governing body. The work of the Trust will be supplementary to, and not in substitution for, that of the County Councils, whose co-operation in the provision of smallholdings under the Small Holdings Acts will still be welcomed.Extent to which Land Settlement can be effected105. The number of men who can be settled on the land through the various agencies that have been mentioned cannot be stated with any precision but it is clear that the total from(3) The Association are also prepared to undertake twenty schemes of 40 families each in other parts of England out-side the Special Areas. The total cost of these schemes will be provided out of the Special Areas Fund. Each scheme will be submitted for my specific approval.The&apos;arrangements with the Land Settlement Association may be conveniently summarised as follows:
all schemes inaugurated should prove helpful, if small in relation to some estimates. Each scheme will provide the conditions that are necessary to ensure the greatest possibility of successful settlement, namely, (i) settlement in groups; (2) adequate supervision and expert guidance both during training and after-wards; and (3) co-operative methods in the purchase of supplies and the marketing of produce.Group Holdings106. The holdings described in the preceding paragraphs are intended to be large enough to afford an independent livelihood to their occupiers after their initial period of training. The term &quot; group holding &quot;, though not perhaps a very apt description, has come to be applied to a type of holding (intermediate between a small holding and an allotment), which is large enough to augment the resources of the holder but not to afford full subsistence. The typical group holding consists of a group of about twenty men, each with about a quarter to a half of an acre of land, part of which is cultivated as an allotment and part used for poultry and egg production. Each man is supplied with seeds and fertilisers for his vegetable plot and with about forty one-day-old chicks, together with materials for con-structing poultry houses, runs, etc., and the necessary fittings and appliances. The cost of the usual poultry outfit varies from  10 to  20 per man, and the arrangement is that 20 or 25 per cent, of the amount provided is repayable in the second and third years.107. Group holdings were started by the Central Committee of the Society of Friends as a result of their experience in con-nection with their work in promoting the cultivation of allot-ments by the unemployed. They found that a number of allot-meht holders had both the capacity and the desire to undertake something more than the usual 10-rod allotment garden, and by the end of 1934 some hundreds of men were working on larger plots of this type or some variation of it. In the majority of cases the Society of Friends had been able to enlist the valuable co-operation of the expert agricultural staffs of the County Councils ton a voluntary footing. In the Special Areas, at the time when I took office, there were a considerable number of centres.in.Durham and a few in Northumberland and Cumber-land. In Wales there was only one poultry-centre with 5 men, situated in the Rhondda Valley. The cost of these Schemes was being borne entirely by the Society of Friends without any Government grant.108. In County Durham everything was ready for a big ex-tension of group holdings as soon as the money was available, and I was early able to promise that this should be forthcoming from the Special Areas Fund.   It was my intention to make a
grant to the Society of Friends Central Committee, but the Durham County Council, whose special Committee and Director of Agriculture were giving much time and thought to the de-velopment of the groups, preferred direct dealings, and the Friends were good enough to acquiesce in this arrangement. Accordingly I undertook to make a grant to the Council of  11,765 for the purpose of inaugurating 38 new centres and ex-tending the 13 existing centres, and promised further financial assistance if additional centres could be set going.The position at the end of June was that 27 new centres had been started providing for a total of 532 men, while the 13 existing centres had been extended. These figures are1 exclusive of a number of new centres financed out of funds provided by the High Sheriff of Hertfordshire under the County adoption scheme (see paragraph 159).109. In no other County has such speedy development been found possible. The Society of Friends agreed to remain responsible for developments in Cumberland and Northumber-land in association with the County agricultural and educational staff, and grants were approved for extending two existing centres and starting one new centre in Cumberland at a cost of  1,400 and for extending five existing centres and establishing three new centres in Northumberland at a cost of  1,600. As the figures indicate, the Cumberland schemes were on a rather more ambitious scale than those in Durham and included the keeping of pigs.no. No groups have actually commenced operations in South Wales, but the necessary administrative machinery has been created and it is expected that a number of centres will be established shortly. Much thought has been given to the setting up of a suitable local organisation and to the formulation of sound working principles which have an important bearing on the success of all such schemes.in. As a result of recent discussion between the Central Com-mittee of the Society of Friends and the Land Settlement Associa-tion it has been arranged that responsibility for organising and supervising group holdings outside the Special Areas in Durham shall be transferred from the Committee to the Association and the Association are proposing to establish several hundred in-dividual group holdings in both Cumberland and Northumber-land. This will not entail any alteration in my policy. Lam certain that under proper management and with expert guidance these group holdings may be of the greatest possible physical and moral benefit to men who have little or no hope of obtaining employment again as industrial workers.; The physical exercise is for their advantage; the holding adds to the family resources and the occupation of mind and body helps to. maintain, self-
respect. Moreover the group holding is a valuable training ground for a full time holding.Allotments112. Still lower down the scale in the order of land cultiva-tion stands the allotment garden usually about one-sixteenth of an acre and cultivated in the occupier&apos;s spare time. It should yield sufficient market garden produce to meet the needs of a family of average size, but leaves little or no surplus for sale.113. The cultivation of allotments has fallen away greatly since the years immediately following the War, but strenuous attempts have been made to revive it in the centres of acute unemployment. Much good work has been done in this direction by the Society of Friends, who originated a scheme for supply-ing seeds, fertilisers and tools at very low rates. For several years past this scheme has been assisted by a grant from the Development Fund and last year nearly 118,000 unemployed or impoverished men were helped in this way.114. It had been represented from various quarters that one of the obstacles to the more rapid extension of this work was the difficulty of obtaining land in the areas where the need was greatest. In and around urban areas any vacant land naturally commands prices that are high in relation to its value for agri-cultural purposes, and local authorities are reluctant to make themselves responsible for the financial loss resulting from pur-chase for such use. A letter was therefore addressed to all the allotment authorities in the Special Areas in England and Wales on the 14th January offering to make grants towards the cost of purchasing land for allotments. It was felt to be advisable to fix a maximum price limit of  250 an acre for grant aided purchases, but, in a subsequent letter issued on 1st February, I indicated my willingness to consider on its merits any proposal that would help to extend the cultivation of allotments in the Special Areas.115. It was a matter of some surprise and disappointment that this offer elicited only a very small response from the local authorities. The reason for this is not very clear. There are some who think that the demand for allotments has in the main been met and that the provision of gardens in connection with new housing schemes goes far to supply the need, while com-competing forms of recreation also have their effect. But, bearing in mind the very great value of an allotment to any unemployed man and his family in alleviating some of the worst features of their position, I am not without hope that some further exten-sion may be brought about next season and more widespread advantage be taken of the offer of financial assistance.
No. of Plots. 348895 469n6. The desire for allotments seems keenest at the present time in South Wales, and the principal result of the offer of help was that a number of allotment societies in Glamorgan and Mon-mouth applied for and were given grants of money to pay.the cost of materials for fencing new allotment land. A few grants were also made for the provision of community huts on new allotments, these taking the place of the scattered and often unsightly structures sometimes erected by allotment holders to house their tools, etc. Both these forms of assistance were pre-viously given by the Society of Friends who are now anxious to restrict the use of the limited amount of money they have available for the purpose of rendering help to cases outside the Special Areas.1I7. The assistance promised for the promotion of allotment cultivation up to the 31st May, 1935, may be summarised thus:  A mountGrants to Local Authorities (5)        ...       ...      268Grants to Allotment Societies :-(1) for fencing materials, etc. (27)...       ...      356(2) for materials for Community Huts (8)       197Unemployment allowances during cultivation of the land118. It will be convenient at this point to refer to the official pronouncements that have been made with regard to the possible effect of participation in the various schemes of land cultivation on the right to draw unemployment allowances. The present position in this respect is as follows:  Allotments. No reduction is to be made in allowances in respect of the produce of allotments cultivated by unemployed industrial workers for consumption by their households.Group Holdings.  (1) The Unemployment Assistance Board have expressed themselves in full sympathy with the efforts to encourage unemployed men to cultivate group holdings.(2) Unemployment allowances will continue to be paid by the Board to such men if they are otherwise eligible for them.(3) No account will be taken by the Board of the value of any produce from the group holding consumed by a group holder or his family.(4) No account will be taken of any profits which may result from the sales from any group holding during the first year of the working of such holding.
(5) After the first year profits will only be taken into account if they are substantial. In taking ,them into account the Board will bear in mind any expenditure incurred by the holder directly or indirectly attributable to the working of the holding.Small Holdings. The general policy in regard to unem-ployed men desiring to occupy smallholdings contemplates ayear&apos;s training on the holding prior to the grant of a tenancy, and the payment of a training allowance during that period(see paragraph 88).These pronouncements should allay any apprehension on the part of any unemployed person that his position with regard, to allowances will be injuriously affected by his undertaking the cultivation of an allotment or of a group holding or by his entering upon training for a smallholding under one or other of the schemes assisted out of the Special Areas Fund.Land Drainage119. Land Drainage is the kind of work that appears to offer considerable opportunities for employment, and I received repre-sentations that there was much work of this nature that could usefully be put in hand in the Special Areas. I consulted the Ministry of Agriculture who informed me that it was a settled matter of Government policy to confine land drainage grants to Catchment Boards. The Ministry agreed to circularise the local authorities concerned, inviting them to consider the estab-lishment of a number of Catchment Boards and offering grants up to 60 per cent, of the expenditure on schemes promoted by the Boards so constituted. This offer has now been considered by the many local authorities affected in the Special Areas who have held a number of conferences on the subject. The final result of their deliberations has not yet reached me from the Ministry of Agriculture but is expected very shortly.Afforestation120. Works of afforestation have a high employment value for the money spent, and it is natural that attention should be turned in that direction as a means of providing useful occupa-tion in the Special Areas. The Forestry Commissioners work to a pre-arranged programme and there are various reasons why it is difficult for them to contemplate an increased or accelerated programme in any of the Special Areas.In all the Special Areas the potentialities of the mountainous regions for a bold scheme of afforestation are stressed repeatedly by experts and laymen, and the feeling generally is that the present plans of the Forestry Commission fall far short of what could be done in these Areas. With this view I am inclined to agree.
121. Within or immediately adjacent to the Special Areas in South Wales alone, it has been suggested that there are large tracts of land amounting to 300,000 acres which are prima facie suitable for afforestation. It is realised, however, that sub-stantial areas in South Wales are subject to Common Rights which may preclude the introduction of large scale schemes of afforestation. The Forestry Commission may be forced to exercise their powers of compulsory acquisition in respect of land not subject to Common Rights but which the owners are not prepared to release for afforestation.122. It may be that schemes of afforestation cannot go very far in solving the unemployment problem; yet sound schemes of afforestation are an economic proposition and it is generally accepted that within the next twenty or thirty years a world shortage pf timber can be anticipated. I have, therefore, eon-ferred with the Chairman of the Forestry Commission on the subject, without any results accruing to date.Subsistence Production Schemes123;. Experiments in the promotion of schemes based on the cultivation of the land but associated also with industrial em-ployment are referred to in Part V of this Report (paragraph i5t)-PART VOTHER MEASURES OF SOCIAL IMPROVEMENTVoluntary (Local Amenities) Schemes124. In January I announced to the Press that I was anxious to encourage local amenities schemes on a voluntary labour basis by which unemployed persons in the Special Areas would be enabled to retain or regain their capability for work by the performance of useful occupation, the result of which would be to provide amenities of immediate advantage to those engaged on the work, to their families and neighbours. With this object in view I decided tq give assistance to representative and regularly constituted voluntary bodies who undertook their organisation.125. Many such schemes were in existence before my appoint-ment, and it would have been most unfortunate if these praise-worthy efforts to replace lack of work by useful occupation had declined. The Unemployment Assistance Board and the Minis-try of Labour had already decided that unemployed men engaged on these schemes could continue to draw unemployment allowances and benefit.
Kinds of schemes and conditions for Grant126. In March a circular was issued giving particulars of the kind of scheme that could be helped and the conditions under which such help would be given. The schemes covered such work as:Levelling of ground for games;Improving the aspect of a waste space by turning it into a garden or recreation ground;Provision of a paddling pool for children; and provision of small open-air swimming pools.The circular emphasized that a voluntary (local amenities) scheme should not involve the performance of work which was likely to be undertaken by a local authority, or by any other body, for wages. No definite age limits were prescribed for those taking part, but the hope was expressed that preference would be given to older men, say, those over 35 years of age; and it was pointed out that, for younger men who were anxious to fit them-selves for employment, the Government Training or Instructional Centres provided more adequate and appropriate opportunities. Where there were more volunteers over 35 years of age than could be employed on a scheme at one time, it was suggested that a system of rotation should be adopted. Every endeavour was to be made to obtain the freehold of any land necessary for a scheme or, failing that, the use of the land on nominal or reasonable terms; in any case, the tenure of the land under lease was to be such as to justify the execution of the scheme; the advantages of the scheme, when completed, were to be secured to the local community, either by vesting the property in the local authority or a Trust, or by other means, in such a way as to provide for adequate maintenance in the future; appropriate arrangements had to be made for securing the proper administration of funds; and it was desirable that the organisers should include in their objects the collection of funds from other sources.Objects of Grant127. Grants have been made towards the cost of the necessary tools, materials, working clothes and mid-day meals; in some instances, the cost of purchasing land; and in others, the cost of providing and erecting a hut on the site, which could serve as a shelter for persons occupied on the schemes and afterwards possibly as a pavilion. Technical advice in the preparation of the plans and the execution of the work has also been provided.Schemes promised assistance128. Seventeen schemes have been approved in the Durham and Tyneside area and seven in South Wales. The total sum granted or promised in these cases is , 6,413 and the number of
unemployed persons occupied on the schemes is approximately 930. Other schemes, including some from West Cumberland, are under active consideration.129. A schedule of the schemes to which assistance has so far been given is contained in Appendix X.Social ServiceValue of Voluntary Social Service Work130. One of the Commissioners duties is to facilitate measures for the social improvement of the Special Areas, and among such measures the provision of social services should clearly play an important part. It was therefore necessary to consider at an early stage how various forms of social service could most effectively be stimulated. For a number of years there has been a great variety of such services in the Areas, conducted by a large number of voluntary bodies, some local and some national, all seeking within their respective spheres of operation to contribute to the social improvement of the Areas. The greater part of this service is given voluntarily, and no one who has hrst hand knowledge of what has been done could fail to be impressed by the value of the work and the spirit in which it has been conducted.Policy of centralised grants131. I was very anxious that the fact of my appointment should not in any way hinder this valuable work or dry up the sources of private assistance. I therefore addressed to the &quot; Times &quot; shortly before Christmas 1934 a letter of which a copy, is attached in Appendix XI. It was however clearly my duty not merely to encourage existing efforts but to try to stimulate further developments of Social Service in the Areas. For that purpose it was necessary to determine at an early stage whether the many local organisations should be encouraged to come to me with their separate plans and proposals, or whether the work should be centralised in the main through some co-ordinating body. The former course entailed obvious danger in the way of overlapping and lack of co-ordination, and it would have been difficult to determine the respective merits of the numerous applications which would doubtless have been made for financial assistance.The National Council of Social Service132. It was therefore decided to adopt the policy of central-ising grants for Social Service through the National Council of Social Service. This Council, which was established in 1919, has a very efficient organisation for co-ordinating all forms of Social Service and has been responsible for directing the large
amount of recreational and occupational work for the unem-ployed which resulted from the Prince of Wales&apos; Albert Hall Speech in January, 1932. By this means it was possible to stimulate effort on certain broad lines of policy without undue interference with local initiative and resource. In consultation with representatives of the Council I determined the general direction in which further efforts should be stimulated, and gave the Council substantial grants to enable them to carry this policy into effect. At the same time, to encourage all organisations doing good work. I agreed to consider on its merits any applica-tion for assistance in furthering local efforts which the Council felt itself unable to support.133. Particulars of the grants allocated to the National Council or Social Service are as follows: School camps for boys and girls ...      ...       70,000Occupational Centres and holidays for women        12,500 Capital grants for occupational centres for men         3,125 Social Settlements ...      ...      ...      ...       7,000Social Centres for Adolescents ...      ...       30,000Lecture Courses, Choral Societies, Drama Groups  r2,500 Provision of additional District Nurses       ...       17,100 At the date of this Report it is not possible to give a full account of the activities under these headings, but the following paragraphs give some idea of the progress that has been made.134. The grants from the Special Areas Fund are being used to stimulate voluntary effort and to supplement yoluhtary resources, depleted by the poverty that has resulted from prolonged industrial depression and widespread unemployment. Social enterprises which were flagging have been revived, and fresh activities have been initiated which it is hoped will in time have far reaching effects on the health and happiness of many people. The National Council&apos;s aim has been to strengthen the hands of national, regional and local bodies engaged in various forms of voluntary social service in the conviction that the social improvement of the areas will be achieved &quot; not by the genius of a few but by the faithfulness of many.&quot;Children&apos;s School Camps135. Many of the children in the Special Areas have never been away from homes in which poverty and strain have been constantly present for years. To spend a fortnight by the sea with good feeling, new surroundings and the fun of Camp life, is a health-giving and happy experience which the Special Areas Fund is making possible for something like 20,000 boys and girls this summer. There are to be established eleven standing school camps, two in Northumberland, two in Durham^ three in
Yorkshire, one in Cumberland, two in Glamorgan and one in Carmarthen, to which parties of school-children accompanied by their teachers will go in relays during the months of May, June, July and September. Seven camps were in1 use.at the end of May and four more were nearing completion. In arranging these school camps the National Council has had the full co-operation of the Y.M.C.A. and other voluntary organisations, the Board-,of Education, Local Education Authorities and the school teachers. Without the help of the teachers it would have been impossible to arrange school camps for so many children. Their attendance has rendered it possible to hold the camps during term time and so to take advantage of four summer months instead of being restricted to the one holiday month of August. I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the teachers for their co-operation in this service.Adolescent Boys and Girls.136. The Special Areas grant has been used to strengthen well established movements whose various methods have proved attractive to different types of boys and girls and whose work in the Special Areas was greatly handicapped by local poverty. The following are among the bodies to which money has been allotted:-The National Association of Boys&apos; Clubs.The National Council of Girls&apos; Clubs.The Young Men&apos;s Christian Association (Boys&apos; Dept.).The Young Women&apos;s Christian Association (Girls&apos; Dept.).The Boys&apos; Brigade.The Girls&apos; Life Brigade.The Church Lads&apos; Brigade.The Girls&apos; Guildry.The Boy Scouts&apos; Association.The Girl Guides&apos; Association.Urdd Gobaith Cymru.137. The first need in many cases was additional personnel to stimulate local interest, and secondly the renewal of equip-ment which had been worn out. A third need in many cases was the provision of suitable premises in which to meet. Care is being taken to avoid overlapping, and in some places two or more organisations have been assisted to launch a joint scheme. Some assistance has also been given for the purpose of enabling boys and girls from the Special Areas to have camping holidays.138. Some examples of the uses to; which this form of grant has been put are set out below,
Xke. Y. W:C.rAx.say &apos; that &quot; Clubs have been opened in Blaydon, South Shields, Forest Hill and Throckley. There has been excellent response in each place. Already 320 new members have been enrolled &quot;. . , . &quot; An experienced Club Leader was appointed in April and has opened clubs in Workington, Maryport and Kells.&quot; In the case of Maryport a grant of  250 enabled the Y.W.C.A. to secure a stone building on the sea-front, formerly used as a ware--\house, which is beihg converted into an excellent club. It ; will comprise a&apos;large hall suitable for physical training and games, clock rooms and office, on the ground floor; and a club room, two handicraft rooms and a bath-room on the upper floor.The Boy Scouts&apos; Association say that Grants made include one for the purchase of a whaler for the Hebburn Sea Scouts, and grants towards the cost of headquarters premises in Newcastle, Tarrow, Pelton, Pontypridd, Port Talbot, Groeswen and other places.The Y.M.C.A. say that &quot; The grants for assisting our work m the Special Areas have given new heart and encourage-.; ment where it was most needed and are responsible for a revival of interest which had been slacking off owing to . poor equipment and lack of leadership &apos;&apos;. Among the places to which help has been given are Consett, Herring-ton Burn, North Shields, South Shields, Ndwcastle-on-Tyrie, Gateshead, Sunderland, Rowrah, Whitehaven, Port Talbot, Tredegar and Aberaman.The Boys&apos; Brigade say that &quot;In the Northumberland-Durham Area a full-time organiser has been appointed and he has the backing of an energetic committee. Steps have been taken to give special assistance to certain places, e.g.:, Jarrow, where there was a risk of some of the present , Companies closing down owing to the abnormally dis-tressed conditions. As the result of an intensive extension campaign about 20 new Companies are in course of forma-tion, and fresh contacts, with possibilities of further , openings for Companies, are being made every week. Assistance in the form of equipment is being given to these new Companies, but everywhere a spirit of self-help is encouraged. The training of Officers is being provided for by local training courses, and in addition two residential training schools of a week&apos;s duration, are to be held. Camping will be much increased this summer by means of per capita subsidies for those for whom the Newcastle Battalion&apos;s Camping Centre at Hawthorn Tower, Seaham, will provide &quot;.
There is a similarly promising story of development in South Wales and Cumberland.The National Council of Girls&apos; Clubs say that &quot; The grants for the extension of their work amongst adolescents in the Areas have been of great value particularly in helping clubs in the poorest districts &quot; . . . &quot; Grants have been made for such items as handicrafts equipment, music, sewing machine, cupboards, games and &apos; Keep Fit &apos; equipment, rent for hire of halls, and small sums for decoration and much needed repairs to premises &quot; . . . &quot; We welcome the opportunity these developments have given of co-operat-ing closely with the boys&apos; club organisers and with other local groups, e.g. the Girl Guides, so that the co-ordination of schemes for the welfare of adolescents as a whole may be assured &quot;.Equally encouraging progress is reported from all the organi-sations to whom grants have been made.Women139. The strain imposed on women by the unemployment of their men folk is not sufficiently realised. Not only must they try to make ends meet on a reduced income, but they have to maintain a cheerful demeanour in a family that has little cause for cheerfulness, and keep house when the circumstances that made housework orderly cease to exist. For the housewife there is no money for anything but home needs and few opportunities -ties for outside interests. It had, however, been discovered by social service organisations that many such women welcomed eagerly the chance to join together in clubs where they could make and mend clothing, and learn dressmaking and other home crafts. The grant from the Special Areas Fund has made possible a big development of such clubs. Already there are over 70 in the Special Areas of South Wales and considerable numbers in other areas. They form part of the movement for self help and community service which had already been expressed in occupational clubs for men and in unpaid service for the common good. Many of the women&apos;s clubs share in men&apos;s club premises and in educational and other activities. Among their needs are advice and guidance on club organisation, skilled instruction in sewing and other crafts and help in the purchase of materials and equipment. It has also been found possible to enable some thousands of women to have a. holiday and change of scene for a week or two in some cases at the camps referred to above.Among the bodies to which the expenditure of money from the Special Areas Fund for the provision of advisory, in-30564 q
Structional and other services for. the. benefit of women has been entrusted are- &apos; ,The Tyneside.Council of Social Service. The Community Service Council for County Durham. The Cumberland Friends&apos; Unemployment Committee. The South Wales and Monmouthshire Council of Social Service.The National Council of Girls&apos; Clubs.The Social Service Settlements at Trealaw, Merthyr Tydfil, Bargoed, Pontypool and Risca.Men140. The necessary assistance for occupational clubs for men is found in the main from the grant made to the National Council by the Minister of Labour but, in circumstances in which that source of grant could not be drawn upon, money from the Special Areas Fund has been made available for the pur-chase or building of permanent club premises.Such grants have been made to the Annfield Plain Social Ser-vice Committee, Page Bank Village Centre, Sunderland Unem-ployed Social Council, Tyneside Council of Social Service and Tonyparidy Unemployed Club.To some extent the men from occupational centres will benefit from the use of the camps referred to above, when these are not required for school children.Educational Activities141. In the Special Areas there is room for development of many forms of activity that are not less truly educational because they are informal.Choral and instrumental music, drama, wireless listening groups, lectures, reading, study groups these are some of the means by which life under depressed industrial conditions may be made more interesting and the individuals&apos; talents may be developed. Local education authorities and voluntary associa-tions are developing the more formal types of adult education to the extent of their powers but there remain many opportunities for more informal educational work.142. For example, in the South Wales area a joint com-mittee, now merged in the South Wales and Monmouthshire Council of Social Service, had been promoting activities of this kind for several years and had a far larger demand than could be met. The Workers Educational Association, the Y.M.C.A. (Educational Department) and the National Council of Music, even with the co-operation and help of the University and the local education authorities, were unable to satisfy the call for lectures, short courses, singing and music clubs, and for&apos;help with choirs, orchestras, festivals and dramatic work.   In other
Special Areas occupational clubs, are beginning to shew similar interests especially in music and drama, and it is already clear that the Special Areas Fund can enable a great expansion of these educational activities to take place. -       &apos;143. Grants have been made for these purposes to the South Wales and Monmouthshire Council of Social Service, the Tyne-side Council of Social Service and the Community Service Council for County Durham, with each of which voluntary bodies are associated representatives of local education authorities.Social Settlements144. Social Settlements serve as local&quot; power houses &quot; from which new ideas and energy radiate, as centres to which clubs can turn for help and guidance, and as places where meetings can - be held for the discussion of common interests.In some areas, notably in parts of South Wales and in County Durham, social settlements have been largely responsible for helping groups in their neighbourhoods to develop the clubs for men and. for women as well as other forms of educational work and community service.145. Each settlement is affiliated either to the Educational Settlements Association or the British Association of Residential Settlements and is thus able to draw on many forms of help which these central bodies can give. But, like other voluntary efforts in the Special Areas, their work had outgrown their means and they were unable to keep pace with the demands for their activities. In some places there was great need for premises or equipment: in all places additional personnel was required.146. Grants have been made to the following settlements and others are under consideration: Maes-yr-haf Educational Settie-ment, Trealaw, Rhondda, Merthyr Tydfil Settlement, Oxford House Settlement, Risca, Bargoed Educational Settlement, Pontypool League of Service. The possibility of extending settlement work in other areas is being explored by the National Council.District Nursing147. District Nursing is an essential health service&apos; which is mainly organised on a voluntary basis. In time of prosperity it was not difficult for each local community to maintain the district nurse by means of small weekly contributions, but in the bad. times of recent years many local associations have been kept alive only with great difficulty. In some districts the number of nurses is far below what is needed. &apos;A careful survey of the position showed that in the Special Areas of South Wales about 70 additional nurses are needed and 30564 c z,
6o *in County Durham about 40., . Generally too, help is urgently needed to supplement the efforts of local communities to main-tain existing services.Grants have been made to &quot;&apos;. \   Sunderland District Nursing Association.Northumberland County Nursing Association;Newcastle District Nursing Council.Gateshead Nursing Association. .7   . South Shields and District Nursing Association.Durham County Nursing Association.West Hartlepool Nursing Association.Glamorganshire County Nursing Association.Monmouthshire County Nursing Association., These grants have only recently been made, but already nine additional nurses have been appointed in Durham and Tyne-side and seven in South Wales; active steps are being taken : to bring the numbers up to the estimated needs.Cookery Courses148. I have had under consideration the question of nutri-&apos; tion in the Special Areas, and I feel that there is room for improvement in regard to the methods of purchase and prepara-tion of food in working-class homes. There is a real need for direction and instruction. This need is of course not confined to the Special Areas, but I have come to the conclusion that my &apos; responsibility in regard to these Areas provides a suitable opportunity for work in this connection. My object is to enable the women-folk, to learn which fodstuffs have the best nutri-tive Value, to spend such money as is available to&apos; them economically and wisely on essential foodstuifs and to teach them how to prepare these most suitably and palatably for family consumption. For this purpose I think that no more practicable service can be instituted than by providing courses in simple cookery for housewives.149, I am encouraged by the great success which attended a recent&apos; experiment in this direction in Carlisle to believe that the women would readily attend, though I am conscious that a&apos; great deal depends upon the provision of instructors or . lecturers of the right personality.150. I am accordingly inviting the assistance and co-opera-. tion of the National Council of Social Service and the National Federation of Women&apos;s Institutes, with a view to setting up as many simple cookery courses and demonstrations as may be possible and desirable during the forthcoming winter. I am hoping that these organisations will enjoy a large measure of public support and the help of other public and voluntary bodies, in particular the local education authorities.
6-iSubsistence Production Schemes151. During the past year or so, attention has been drawn to one or two schemes initiated in different parts of the country which have come to be known as &quot;subsistence production schemes &quot;. The idea underlying such a scheme is to establish a community of unemployed persons primarily engaged on working on the land for their own mutual advantage, but there will also be small central workshops for boot-making and repairing, tailoring and such other activities of this type as may prove practicable. Production will only be for consump-tion and exchange between the members of the community and it is not the intention that there should be surplus production for sale outside the community. The object of this type of scheme is to provide useful, healthy and interesting occupation for those at present unemployed mainly the older married men  who are not likely to find their way back into active industrial employment, to improve their morale and alleviate the dejec-tion caused by prolonged unemployment, to raise their standard of living and to make them less dependent than at present upon allowances provided wholly by the State. These original schemes have been successfully launched notably at Upholland, Lancashire, under the direction of An Order of Friends, and the Homecroft Experiment near Cheltenham administered by the National Homecroft Association but-only on a very modest scale.152. The Upholland Experiment at the beginning of this year consisted of a small group of eleven men and two women. The organisers felt that though this small experiment had been successful it was necessary to experiment on a much larger scale before conclusions could be drawn. By the generosity of Lord Nuffield a great extension of the work has become possible, and I have agreed to make a grant up to  12,000 from the Special Areas Fund (of which  5,000 has so far been advanced) towards the establishment of what is now to be called a &quot;Subsistence Production Society&quot; in South Wales. It is hoped that this will eventually enable the scheme to be carried out on the basis of providing for 500 families. A start has already been made, fully qualified supervisory staff has been obtained, and over a hundred and forty members are enrolled and at Work. Five plots of land for glass-house culture, vegetable growing and the keeping of poultry, pigs;, etc., have been obtained in the Eastern Valley, of Monmouth. These, five plots comprise a total of 93 acres and are expected to provide interesting occupation for from 40 to 100 unemployed men on each. Central offices, stores and workshops are being. developed and a start has already been made with wood-work, boot repairing and tailoring.  , It is hoped shortly to bring other activities into
operation. A central farm has been obtained and is being used mainly for dairy farming, the object being to provide milk for the 500 families to be provided for under the scheme. Pigs and poultry will also be raised for distribution to the plots. Arrange-ments are also being made for working a small coal level for the supply of coal to the community.153. -It is clearly much too early to draw any deductions from this . experiment as yet. Some time must elapse before it is fully mature, and a further interval will be required before any conclusions can reasonably be formed. It is, however, an experiment which is being watched with the greatest interest.Adoption; 154. Many bodies and persons have expressed the wish to do something to , ameliorate the conditions of their less fortunate countrymen in the Special Areas and have sought my advice on the question of adopting parts of these areas. It therefore seems desirable to include a reference to the subject in this Report.T&apos;55. There are various forms which these adoption schemes can take, e.g. the adoption by more fortunate families of those less fortunate, the adoption by a county, a town, a church or an association in the more prosperous parts of the Country or by the staff of a Government Department or by a business firm, Of a town or village in the Special Areas, or the financial support of a particular kind of institution or activity in the Special Areas..156. So far as Social Service is concerned, the National Council of Social.Service, are endeavouring to co-ordinate, the activities of adopting bodies and they are willing to suggest suitable places ior objects for adoption.157. I admire the spirit in which the generous offers are made but I think there is a danger that unless they are guided in the right direction they may be less successful than they deserve. If an adopting organisation is large and powerful enough to arrange for the establishment of new industries or the revival of existing industries in the adopted Town something of real value is done and a definite step is taken towards the economic recovery of the area. It is seldom, however, that an adopting organisation is powerful enough to be able to organise new industries, but every adopting organisation should find it possible to do something to meet the needs of the Special Areas by finding employment in its own district, facilitating the removal of the workers and the settlement of individuals or families in their new surroundings.There are many, areas in the middle and south of England which could easily absorb individuals and families from the Special. Areas without any detriment to the local employment position.  Though employment may be available, housing may
be an impediment, but this difficulty might very well be removed by active goodwill on the part of the organisation in the more fortunate area, and in&apos;this respect members of a voluntary body can be of the greatest practical use.158. I would therefore appeal strongly to all bodies and organisations in the more prosperous parts of the Country to consider seriously whether they cannot bring practical help to the Special Areas by these methods. An adoption scheme which finds permanent employment in a new area brings real relief to individuals and groups and is of far greater permanent value than the adoption of palliatives such as the provision of clothes, social amenities or even temporary work given in the Special Areas.159. I have not thought it part of my duty to catalogue precisely the,existing varied forms of adoption, but among those which have come to my notice I am glad to welcome the effort of the County of Surrey, which under the leadership of Sir John Jarvis, is assisting Jarrow by endeavouring to establish new, and revive old, industries; by providing ground for allotments; by supplying the materials with which unemployed men may redecorate their homes; by constructing a new park; by the transference of girls to employment in Surrey; and by other means; that of the County of Hertfordshire under the leadership of Captain Haslam in adopting half a dozen of the most un-fortunate. colliery villages in County Durham and in establishing schemes for poultry keeping and land cultivation, and assisting occupational centres; and that of the town of Bedford which has adopted a small township in County Durham with a view to finding employment in Bedford for numbers of men, women and boys and girls, housing the newcomers and providing social arrangements to prevent homesickness., PART VI ,TRANSFERENCE OUT OF THE AREASCo-operation with the Ministry of Labour160. Transference of individuals and families out of the Special Areas must in my view be regarded as one of the essen-tial measures of relief. My policy has therefore aimed at making clear the desirability of encouraging the younger persons to, take every opportunity of obtaining employment outside the areas. As indicated in paragraph 24 above, I am, leaving executive action in regard to the transfer of persons from, the Special Areas.to other parts of the country in the hands of the Ministry of Labour since the Ministry has the necessary machinery in the national Employment Exchange service and I have hone. As far as.possible my action has always been influenced by the desire to&apos; increase the number of openings available elsewhere for.persons from the Special Areas.:
Lady Headlam&apos;s transference schemei6t. While the Ministry of Labour is the main agent for trans-ference, there is a local enterprise in the County of Durham, under the direction of Lady Headlam, which has for a number of years had for its object the transfer of young women and boys, from that County to employment, mainly domestic, in London and the South of England. During the existence of this voluntary organisation about 8,000 young women and boys have been reported as placed in employment in: the; more prosperous areas. The enterprise has been supported hitherto by voluntary contributions and by the fees of domestic employers.Representations were made to me that this useful voluntary effort would have to come to an end unless further financial support was forthcoming. After careful consideration I came to the conclusion that I should be justified in providing grant-aid to theextent of  1,000 a year for two years towards the cost of maintaining the employment office at Holywell, Durham, and a small contribution towards the building of an office to replace one which was unfortunately burnt down or, alternatively, to renting a building for office purposes.Transference policy162. The policy of transferring individuals and families from the Special Areas has been criticised in certain quarters; and, in view of the misconceptions prevailing on the subject it: seems desirable to set out in some detail the main considerations which have led me to support the policy. In the Conclusions of this Report I express my conviction that, given a determined effort, initiated by the people themselves, there can be a steady revival in the Special Areas. Nevertheless we must recognise that whatever improvement is effected there will remain a substantial number suited to and seeking regular employment, that will be in excess of the. requirements of industry in their own district.Areas without prospects163. Whilst there is hope of revival for the more firmly estab-lished industrial districts in the Special Areas, there are parts of these Areas for which it is difficult to see an economic future. &quot;These are mainly situated in some of the coal and iron districts hp the valleys in South Wales, in the West Durham coalfield, and in some of the smaller towns and villages surrounding Cleator Moor in Cumberland. Unemployment in some of these small districts has,-for a number of years, amounted to practi-cally three-quarters of the employable population. The com-munity in fact is little more than a. small town or village built round a coal shaft. When the coal ceases to be worked the possibility of economic life disappears.  There is no justification
that I can discover for establishing industrial enterprise in such places. The history of the development of coal in this, country,, and indeed in all coal producing countries, repeats the same story, that there is always a tendency I to&apos; abandon pits which become uneconomic in favour of new areas &apos;pf coal deposits&apos;. Normally this process is spread gradually over a number, of years and the disinherited population has less difficulty in be-coming absorbed in other places. The difficulties of the Coal industry since the War have been telescoped into a few&apos; years--a process which normally might have been.spread over a longer period but the results of the process are. none the less definite.Two Groups164. In terms of prospective employment the Communities which have suffered&apos;in this way are composed of two groups, those who on account of increasing age or physical defects would have serious difficulty in re-establishing themselves in any indus-try involving heavy manual labour and possess little aptitude: for other types of work, and the younger group, both married and single, who would not be similarly handicapped if they were brought into contact with other opportunities of employment.-.For the younger group there is no alternative but movement. It is the same with a community as with the individual. If the occupation in which a man has made his livelihood is lost, he must strike out to make a living in some other Occupation. If he can, he finds another occupation nearby; if this is im-possible, he has to be prepared to go further afield.&quot; So it&apos;is with these small communities in parts of the Special Areas.  JLocal Ties --y.:&apos;&apos;--&apos;:165. Now what are the obstacles to movement of this kind, or transfer, as it is sometimes called? In the first place there is the personal objection. A man puts his roots down in the place where he works and lives. He has his family and his friends and associations in that place. It is a hard thing to tear up those roots. It is one o.f the many fine characteristics- of mining communities that their personal associations, their communal life, is strong. In the case of South Wales this communal life is strengthened by a sense of belonging to a distinctive national life, and in parts of the West Durham coalfield and the Cumber-land area the comparative remoteness of some Of the small areas dependent on coal has caused reduced contact-with the normal varied industrial life of the country. Already some of the more venturesome and far-sighted persons in these communities/have recognised the necessity of moving in order to make their living elsewhere, and are already establishing themselves in other coal-fields, or in other occupations away from their home, but it appears at first sight harsh to tell such communities that removal must be the policy which governs their future life.   Yet it must
be recognised. Widespread unemployment itself is apt to reduce the morale, of a community, which becomes weakened as the community consciously settles down into a dependence upon a dole. I am not speaking now with any technical reference to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance. There is a. wider issue. Large numbers of persons in these communities are living upon money received but not earned; their lives lack purpose; the sense of personal responsibility fades; disappoint-ment engenders resentment of criticism and dulls consciousness of opportunity.166. Therefore when I learn of strong personal objections to the whole idea of movement of transfer, I say to myself: how can those communities expect to continue and develop their personal life,if they, have no means of earning their living in personal independence?Chances of Employment out of the Special Areas167. The next objection is that, even if they wished to move, the question is asked, whither can they move with the expecta-tion of employment, in view of the,widespread extent of existing unemployment? This objection is based upon a very deeply-rooted fallacy, that there is only a certain amount of work to go round, and. that, if the population of a particular area increases there will be less opportunity of work for the people in the area. The. whole of industrial history of the last 100 years refutes the fallacy. The population of London has increased rapidly in recent years; the proportion of persons in the London area who form the working population has increased still more rapidly, and yet unemployment in the London area has, on the average, been lower than can be found in any large industrial area in this country or elsewhere. It is a population that makes work and not work that makes a population.But even if, under present conditions, the transfer of men from the depressed areas to the prosperous areas would for a time appear to deprive some of the persons in the prosperous areas of the opportunities of employment, and at the worst this can only be for a time, then I think that in the national interest the issue should be faced. At the worst it is a choice between a&apos;rather more intermittent employment for certain groups of workpeople in prosperous areas, and the virtual condemnation of whole communities to complete idleness. I know of no area or of no section of people, of no Trade Union, which facing that inexorable choice would declare in favour of keeping out of the prosperous areas the wholly unemployed persons&apos; in the depressed, areas, for fear someone in the prosperous area might possibly lose some work. &apos; .
Position of those transferred168. The third objection concerns the economic position of a man who comes into a strange area, establishing himself in em-ployment with difficulty. Is this more serious than it would be if he remained in his own home area? I have heard it said, for example, that the prospects of obtaining unemployment benefit must be less, that the amount of the allowances pay able, as un-: employment assistance may vary, and that the probabilities are that the allowance will be less in the prosperous area than it would be in the completely depressed area. My enquiries do not suggest that this is so, but, if it. is, it can be easily corrected. I understand that the Unemployment Assistance Board, who in the.main are responsible for the allowances to men long unem-ployed in the depressed areas, have as a settled policy a desire to help transfer, and that they have both the will and the power so to adjust any allowances to unemployed men that they need have no hesitation, on that ground at any rate, in taking the venture of seeking work in a new place and in a new&apos;occupation., The whole cost of the removal of a man and his family can be paid by public funds, he can be helped with the necessary ex--, penditure to establish himself in a new house, he can receive allowances which will keep him in accordance with the standards that are obtainable in the new area, and in at least as satisfactory a position as he was in his home area; he can be introduced to other persons from his own area and other friends who will make him welcome.Training for new occupations169. Finally, there is the objection that a large proportion of the men in the depressed areas have specialised in one occupa-tion, mainly coal, and that they have not the necessary know-ledge or skill for engagement in other occupations. This is a defect which is exaggerated. It can be overcome; the fact that many of the men are versatile helps in overcoming it. The Ministry of Labour has established various types of training centres where men can have an opportunity of making them-selves both physically fit and industrially fit for seeking new employment. While they are under training the Ministry of Labour and the Unemployment Assistance Board can arrange that financially their households do not suffer in any way by the withdrawal of a member who may be in receipt of an allowance.A progressive policy170. I recognise of course that transfer in large numbers can-not be effected in a short time; but a progressive policy will have cumulative results. The younger unmarried men will have the opportunity of bringing to live with them their older relatives;
if they wish; the younger married men will know that, if they go to the areas with prospects their children, as they reach the age of employment, will have opportunities of absorption into varied industries in the new areas.171. After careful examination, therefore, I have reached the clear conclusion that, for an appreciable proportion of the workpeople in parts of the depressed areas, transfer to other districts and other trades is necessary if they wish to gain their living. I am certain that the policy is workable. To make it successful depends on two things, the unequivocal recognition by the Government and all other important authorities of its necessity, and on the part of the people themselves willingness to make the venture. Every inducement should be held out to those who are willing to transfer and are likely to establish themselves in other areas. The Government can help in this matter. If they agree with the view I have expressed about the necessity for transfer, they can bring pressure to bear upon persons carrying out works or conducting services which receive financial assistance from Government funds, to accept, through the Employment Exchanges, a proportion of suitable men from the depressed areas. Such a lead would be followed, I believe, by other employers, and especially employers who have to go outside their own immediate district for labour. If all employers who need labour from outside their own district, and there are already many of these, were to apply to the Employment Ex-changes, the Exchanges could steadily bring men from the Special Areas into contact with opportunities of employment. A few men successfully established in this way will quickly induce others&apos;to follow their example.The Aged and Infirm172. For those, who because of age or other physical handicaps must wait, I assume that the Unemployment Assistance Board and other agencies will wish to do whatever they can to meet their needs fully, and I have freely assisted voluntary organisa-tions such as the National Council of Social Service to develop the communal activities which make more tolerable a life of involuntary idleness.    .Those unwilling to help themselves173. There remains one section, fortunately still a small section, those who could have a chance of making their living in other directions but decline to make use of any of the opportunities that are put before them. , I cannot think that it is sound policy, in the interests of the men themselves,... to make; easy the continued acceptance by them of such an outlook.
PART Vll .&apos;    -FINANCE -.. &apos;.r.&apos;.&apos;./174. The Special Areas (Development and Improvement) Act provided for the establishment of a Special Areas Fund, under the control and management of the Treasury, into which there should be paid an initial sum of  2,000,000. This sum was pro-vided to meet the expenses of the two Commissioners (one for England and Wales and one for Scotland), and the Government made it clear that the fact that a specific sum was granted was not intended to limit the expenditure of the Commissioners in the discharge of their functions. The Act therefore provided that further sums may be paid into the Fund when determined by Parliament. &apos;175. As a provisional arrangement it. was agreed that  1,500,000 out of the initial payment into the Fund of  2,000,000 should be regarded as at my disposal. As will be seen from the table of Commitments, I have not been precluded from going beyond this limit in approving grants, in view of the promise of the Government to find further funds should this prove necessary. &apos; .176. It is perhaps not sufficiently appreciated that actual ex-penditure must of necessity be considerably in arrear of com-commitments. Grants will only be paid, as and when the money is actually required. Many of the schemes which have been approved cannot be started immediately owing to the time taken in the preparation of technical details. Moreover, some of the schemes are of long duration, and final payment of grant will not become due in some cases for some years to come. Arrange-ments have been effected for payments on account to be made as and when- required so that the bodies responsible for the work should not be debarred from undertaking schemes owing to the difficulty of finding the necessary funds.-177. It is indicated earlier in the Report that it was necessary to ensure that expenditure out of the Special Areas Fund should be subject to the normal financial control which is exercised &quot;in the disbursement, of State Funds, in order to secure that the decisions of Parliament as recorded on the Statute Book are properly carried out. To provide for this, sums put of the Special Areas Fund to meet my expenditure are issued by the Treasury to the Minister of Labour, who will submit to Parlia-ment an estimate of my requirements each year in the normal manner; these sums are limited to the amounts authorised by Parliament to meet expenditure on the basis of this estimate. The actual expenditure is subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who will report to Parliament thereon. -

The first reaction to a study of the complex problems of the Special Areas is naturally concern for their high percent-ages of unemployment and the desire to seek a cure. The average for all Special Areas in England and Wales, namely, Durham, West Cumberland and South Wales, at the end of May last was 34-5 per cent. The average for England and Wales is 15-, 5 per cent. If a reduction to this figure were possible, it would imply the adoption of measures which could not fairly be instituted without their embracing other districts suffering dis-tress, but not classified as Special. Areas. To bring the unem-ployment in the Special Areas down even to 25 per cent:, the mean between their average figure of unemployment and that of England and Wales, would be a very considerable achieve-178. The following is a summary of the estimated commit-ments into which I have entered. There are other schemes under investigation which will involve considerable expenditure.  100,000 has been provisionally allocated for the Public Utility Society which I am in process of forming for the purpose of providing houses in the Durham area, but the expenditure, on this service will of course depend on the number of houses which the Society find themselves called upon to build, and the ultimate cost of grants for this purpose cannot yet be accurately estimated.
merit, but, frankly, I; see no prospect, of any effective reduction under existing conditions. The economic re-opening of many of the closed mines and works and the finding of adequate markets to, absorb their products could not be procured by a dictator . with unlimited powers of expenditure. He could, apply pallia-tives on a lavish scale, but no permanent relief would.be afforded.r&quot;i8o. The decline of trade is largely due to international causes, economic and political, and their readjustment in the near future, so as to restore effectively lost trade, is not to be looked for in the face of a world committed to increasing economic nationalism. Further, it is accentuated by the world-wide ih-dustrial changes, hastened by the War, which cannot at will be moulded to suit our particular requirements. The effect of the distress can be mitigated, but in respect of some districts in these areas. it is beyond the power of man to turn the tide of trade whence it has ebbed; derelict areas are the wastes and scars left behind. &apos;:.181. Some will say that inability to suggest a revival of former good trade is due to lack of vision. If the inherent causes which have: brought, about the rise and fall of the prosperity of these areas are realised, it becomes apparent that some of the older industries, which are languishing, cannot be revived to order, and distress thereby banished. There will have to be recori-struction and this will be considered later. We must plumb the depths of despair before lifting our eyes to hope.Coal182&apos;. All the areas in my charge have a common feature; nature has bountifully endowed them with coal (and to a far lesser extent iron ore) located within easy access of the sea. The possession of these advantages brought development and indus-trial expansion with the. advent of the locomotive and steam-ship, resulting in a good demand for coal for both the home and export&apos; markets. The backbone of the industrial life which thus grew up was coal. Those who for generations had pursued an agricultural life forsook &quot;the soil, attracted by high wages and the better standard of living offered by work in the pit and factory. Shipbuilding yards and engineering shops became firmly established on sites adjacent to their essential raw materials and offering excellent facilities for a wide distribution of their products. A long period of activity ensued, favoured by our industrial supremacy. This could not last for ever. Nations that had looked to us for fuel and engineering products became more and more self-supporting, often tutored in the art of mariu-facture by their former suppliers of ships, plant and machinery. International competition, at first growing slowly, became keen,
causing the loss of a large proportion of our foreign markets. In addition to these causes of decline of trade,, the opportunity of using coal for;transport has been much curtailed through the competition of imported oil. Its practical use, to the con-venience of mankind, has rapidly been extended by the inven-tion of engines making possible cheap transport from1 door to door and the providing of cheap power in small self-contained units. 1 The concentration, of the generation of electrical power in: large stations and the much improved efficiency attained in the raising of steam: have not only decreased the volume of demand; but. brought about a change in the class and size of the coal called for. The market for once much favoured&apos; large hard coal has so diminished that in order to get rid of it, some collieries have to bear the expense of breaking.183. Then, despite the vast reserves of coal in these areas, more than capable of meeting a shrinking demand, the Kent coalfield was: developed in a rural area. London, its nearest important&apos;market; can obtain cheap seaborne coal from the north east coast. (It is difficult to see that the. development of Kenti coal; Miich has suffered a chequered career, was justified. It should; have remained a potential national asset..184. Consider one of the principal causes of distress, the re-duction of the total ,coal exports (including bunker coal) from Englandand wales from 67-53 million tons in 1929 to 44-90 million tons in 1934, of which exports from the Special Areas represented over 78 per cent. The overriding conditions under which favourable exports were enjoyed have ceased to exist. Will it; not require: every effort to retain the present not too secure position so long as a protective policy is a national need? Much improvement of1 the export trade for coal in the near future can hardly be looked for.I185. What promise, docs the home trade offer? Only such increase, as can come from the general expansion of industry, which, is on the. ,up grade, but there is the certainty in the future of further mechanisation and closing of uneconomic pits, with resultant.increased unemployment of miners, should the present system of quotas be discontinued. This cramps the development of economic pits and the cheaper winning of coal which would put;the ,Industry in a, healthier state and ought to bring better wages to the miner. It is impossible to understand how a system of control which bolsters up inefficiency can be of national advantage. Had a sound policy of economic production been embarked upon some years ago, it should have been possible for the increased &apos; margin of profit7 available to have gone far towards &apos; compensating displaced miners and the closing of re-dundanf pits. Is not the present policy with regard to coal the reverse of the effort how being made to reorganise the Iron and
Steel Industry with the help of the Government. Both policies cannot be right. The Goal Mines Act (1930) has failed in its efforts to control prices and the amendments made in January of this year have so far had no effect. Standard selling prices and conditions are not observed; evasion is procured by resort to devious devices. Inasmuch as the wages of the miners are based on the prices obtained at the pit, these devices have a baneful influence and breed suspicion and distrust where there should be confidence and co-operation. I hope that the Govern-merit and the Industry will urgently review the possibility, of re-organising the sales machinery and of reconsidering the Quota Scheme. However, my object in mentioning these matters is to show the further difficulties with1 which some districts in the Special Areas will be faced when a policy favouring more efficient production is embarked upon.186. Many adverse factors have contributed to its being im-possible to find new markets fast enough to replace the loss of old markets., The nature and extent of these have in the aggre-gate produced a situation in parts of the Special Areas from which no escape can be foreseen. It is the Nemesis which sooner or later overtakes every mining venture from one cause or another. The evidence of this is world-wide. The wonder is that prosperity should have lasted so long; its duration has deceived many into thinking it was immutable. However, the thought of past favours brings no present comfort.187. For the reasons stated I venture to forecast that the present outlook for the Coal Industry is not bright. The future, however, is not without hope. We possess vast resources of coal; this capital asset remains, although its value to-day is reduced because turnover and margin of profit have shrunk. A demand on the old scale for raw coal may be unlikely, but if we can but hasten the advance of knowledge of how to treat coal at the pithead, stimulate research and the application of scientific methods whereby its latent products can be economically extracted, we shall assuredly bring about a change in prospects which will herald a new demand to replace lost trade. Inventive genius may bring this about sooner than appears possible to-day, but before schemes are launched on the public they should be submitted to the independent authoritative-tive tests of the Fuel Research Board.When we consider the magnitude of our coal reserves the value of this great capital asset temporarily depreciated, and the number of experienced miners out of work, we cannot fail to realise the opportunities for the creation of more work and wealth if we could but expand the demand for coal. So much is involved, that increased effort must be made to hasten de-velopment and the taking of risks is warranted.30564 D
Whilst these grave issues are at stake we are wasting effort playing with a vicious and futile scheme of quotas.Private enterprise is actively engaged in proving possible de-velopments, but the matter is of such vital national importance that I would like the Government to consider the extent to-which further inducements are needed to encourage additional large scale operations.        ,-, -i188. In spite of this prospect of improvement, the opportunity&apos; for increased employment in the Coal Industry is unlikely to.be experienced in the near future. The facts must be faced, and, above all, brought home to the unemployed themselves. Measures of relief must be founded on hard facts and &quot;hot oh; fond hopes. -V.-.!.&apos;.-..&apos;. &apos;.&apos;189. I feel that too many of the unemployed miners, knowing that the coal lies beneath their feet and seeing the winding gear ready to turn, cannot realise that nothing, can be done to, put them back to work to bring the coal to the surface.,&apos; ,Habit, of. mind influences them.  They cannot believe; thatthcy&apos; have, had, their last daily tramp in good weather and;bad;&apos;summer winter, to work in the pit where they have. Won,their:&apos;br^ad.^IT they now live in despair it is still despair tinged with expectation! expectation of something turning up from somewhere. .,&apos;;Tn-;: vestigations  are  made,   reports   issued   andV commissioners, appointed, but no one tells them whether the pit, in which&apos;they and sometimes their fathers before them have spent their lives in hewing coal, is to be silent for ever.   This situation needs facing.   Knowledge,technical skill and foresight should be em-ployed to ascertain the facts as far as is humanly possible., Then the true position must be made clear.   In one district I visited, particularly hard hit by closed mines and works, I met the local-representatives.  They were convinced something could be done to restore prosperity.    Could not the Government establish factories or the Commissioner take the situation in. hand and re-open closed pits: and works ?  I told them frankly the first thing to be determined was whether their district was on.or.off the industrial map and, if they were off, there was probably no power that could in their lifetime restore its industrial activities.190. The question of State ownership of mining royalties is now having the consideration of the Government and I will only say that I favour it. I am led to understand that the attitude of royalty owners is, at the moment, more helpful; nevertheless the necessity remains for putting the matter on to a sound basis for the future. It is-particularly necessary to deal with the principles affecting way leaves; the amounts levied at times are- quite un-warranted and their unfair imposition tends to hold up the economic expansion of industry. - - \  r
Iron and Steel191. The Iron and Steel Industry is passing out of a critical stage. That its general efficiency left considerable room for improvement is evidenced by the high rates of tariffs required for its protection, but the lower the efficiency the greater the margin of advantage to be gained from reconstruction and rationalisation, for which co-operation between producers and co-ordination of interests are essential. The benefits to be reaped are not confined to the Industry itself. The influence of cheap steel would permeate through a number of subsidiary and ancillary industries and favour national prosperity!192. The dominant influence which will affect the future of the Iron and Steel Industry lies in the considerable deposits of ores situated in Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire. These ores have been known to geologists for many years. Those in Northamptonshire constitute by far the largest domestic deposit; they have until recently been but little developed for steel making on account of their chemical composition. In this country, low grade ores under the old processes of manufacture could only be used when mixed with a high percentage of richer ores. To-day this is not the case; new processes of manufacture and designs of furnaces have been invented which permit of their use up to roo per cent. Enterprising firms have taken the risk of development, in Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire and have worked their way through the technical difficulties to success. The centre of gravity of the Industry is shifting. It is only a question whether more rapid movement takes place to-day or to-morrow. The supply of these midland ores is almost inexhaustable; they compare favourably, both as to quantity and quality, with the deposits worked by some of our most powerful continental competitors. The practical success already attained indicates that we should be able to hold our own if the opportunity is taken further to develop these ore fields. The economic advantages of locating furnaces, steel works and rolling mills at least for semi-finished products close to the raw materials with which they must be fed are sure to be availed of increasingly. Let us assume this mineral wealth is further de-developed to produce cheaper steel. What help will this bring to the Special Areas? I fear none, but I see the possibility of more distress. .Once again furnaces and works in developed districts will have to be abandoned and the position of others imperilled. The clearer the recognition of the need for reorganisation and the economic location of industry, the greater the need to protect the workers from being abandoned to a life of idleness in less economic areas which may become derelict.305% e
193. There is irony in the fact that the strenuous efforts made by me to reopen certain closed works have tended to compose the differences of competitors and cause a more rapid co-operation to secure the establishment of a higher degree of economic pro-duction than my proposals might offer. The disappointment is great,- but it spurs one on to seek alternative schemes. Once the economic facts have been fairly weighed and personal pre-judibes eliminated, the situation must be accepted with such philosophy as can be commanded. Thus, the finding of work for the unemployed, patiently awaiting the results of negotia-tion, is again delayed.Location of Industry194. If we are to survive as an industrial Nation, we must increase productive efficiency; if our workers hereafter are to enjoy the maximum of continuity of employment with im-proving prospects, economic considerations must in the main determine the location of industry. No decision can be come to without balancing all the factors, including the value of the re-spective merits of old established and new industrial districts. Where there is equilibrium, the decision should be in favour of the old, but it is futile to attempt to establish industries in the Special Areas when the economic facts do not warrant so doing. It would only afford temporary relief, bearing the seeds of further future distress, which is avoidable. However, the Government might with advantage assist industrialists in coming to a decision with regard to the location of industry if it were to set up a central bureau of information to which they could refer for advice and technical data relating to potential in-dustrial districts, not only in the Special Areas but elsewhere. Its influence would tend to establish a better balanced distribu-tion of industrial activity. :195. There are economic sites, some within the Areas, offering the maximum of advantage, but those possessed of developed properties less advantageously situated are not always prepared to face the cost&apos;of drastic scrapping of works, on which perhaps too much capital has been outlaid in patching up. The merging of competing interests and harmony as to sales policy through co-operation would make possible a joint effort to create up-to-date enterprises, but this hastens obsolescence and calls for a bold policy. The benefits which follow increased efficiency are widespread, better wages to the employees, lower prices to the consumer and sounder security for capital. If we are to make sure&apos; of and extend the ground already won through national recovery a bold policy of scrapping obsolete plant ought to be pursued. Every delay to industrial reconstruction capable of securing increased productive efficiency is a lost opportunity for improved national prosperity and I am convinced that this will
provide the means whereby increased help can be given from without and. make easier the absorption of the unemployed from within the areas.Re-esnployment of displaced workers196. The problem of displaced v/orkers is linked with that of location of industry, which is best left, to those in control to determine. The methods whereby this control is exercised need careful consideration. Safeguards are required to protect em-ployees discarded when old works are closed to facilitate the establishment of new, and. some control needs exercising with regard to labour engaged for the latter. There is no obligation on industry to provide for displaced workers although a few benevolently-minded companies and firms have done. so. This should be at least a partial charge on industry; steps should be taken to reduce the occurrence of future distress; It is difficult to see how this can be done without assistance from the Govern-ment. An opportunity was lost for dealing with the question when tariffs were instituted. Whilst tariffs were designed to increase national prosperity, particular industries, by the grant-ing of special rates, receive differential treatment. It surely would have been reasonable for the State, when conferring these advantages, to have aftached conditions designed to protect the workers whose displacement is hastened through the earlier re-organisation of industry aided by the institution of tariffs. Assistance would be afforded if a production licence were re-quired in specified industries before a. new factory could start operations, this condition to apply particularly to new factories established by industries enjoying the advantages of differential tariffs. The licence should be issued by a specially constituted authority responsible to the Minister of Labour. This authority would have to be satisfied as to the nature of the arrangements made for the engagement of labour. It would see that pre-ference was given to those from closed works, and arrange, where local conditions permitted, for the transfer of a suitable percentage of unemployed from the Special Areas. It would be impossible to lay down hard and fast lines, as conditions would vary in each case. Full discretion should be left to the authority to make such arrangements as are deemed suitable to the par-ticular case under consideration. Whilst this proposal would furnish no guarantee as to continuity of employment, it would secure some degree of initial control where now there is none. The capital of shareholders is partially protected by the law requiring that a certificate to commence business must be obtained before a public limited liability company can start its operations. There is greater need to give, protection to the capital of the worker, which usually only consists of his fitness to work. This can generally best fructify through the securing of the most suitable employment in which experience has been 30564 e 2
gained. The position of agricultural districts invaded by indus-try needs consideration. There are some districts short of agri-cultural labourers where they are being turned into industrial workers, and others where industrial workers out of a job are being trained to become agriculturists. A system of licences on the basis outlined would secure preferential treatment to those entitled to it, without interfering with freedom as to the location of industry.Survey and differential treatment197. It should be understood that, when reviewing the changes likely to affect adversely the Special Areas, I do not refer to them as a whole, but only to such parts as offer little or no hope of revival. These should be broadly determined and a survey made to ascertain the possibilities of their industrial revival. If relief is impracticable, plans will have to be made for their future, and possibly some of the smaller areas, whose prospects are hopeless, will have to be evacuated.The survey should be undertaken by an impartial independent authority with whom the Trade Unions should be associated.198. In all the Areas there are districts which, although they bear a heavy percentage of unemployment, yet enjoy a con-siderable degree of industrial activity and offer definite oppor-tunity for development. Demarcation must be made between these and those where.there are little or no prospects of the re-establishrnent of industry. There is a psychological factor which would appear to react unfavourably on these Areas. The very fact that they are distressed not only reduces their power to attract industries, but to some extent reacts on the inhabitants themselves, who seem to have partially lost confidence in their own districts. This is evidenced by the difficulty in obtaining a moderate amount of finance locally to establish industries. The tendency is to look too much, to London for finance and sometimes to complain that London has no interests other than those bound up with the South. Further, it is with regret that I have noted an inadequate support of local industries which so much need increased turnover. Cases have been furnished to me where orders have been placed with local firms to secure prompt delivery to meet an emergency, but despite the assistance thus given normal orders are sent to firms outside the Areas. There is locally too little of the spirit of self-help and too great an inclination to take the view that the future of the Areas must be left to the Government. Whilst I place the necessity for self-help first, it is essential, if any sensible impression is to be made on the problem, of these Areas, that all citizens of the country who can exercise influence in their favour should feel it is their duty to do so in order to relieve the present distress.
199. The River Tyne, which is admirably administered by the Tyne Improvement Commissioners, offers facilities second to none in the country for industrial expansion. There are con-siderable opportunities for development in areas adjacent to the coast lines of South Wales and Cumberland. All these im-portant centres greatly need new industries to effect the replace-ment of lost trade. Compulsory location of industry is im-practicable for the reasons already stated.Where hope lies200. Where shall we look for revival of trade in the Special Areas and how can a start be made ? I will endeavour to answer these questions.201. Throughout the Areas the cry is for work; this can only be satisfied by the creation of production, and by the expansion of industry. The demand for increased factory accommodation is usually satisfied by the extension of existing factories or the building of new adjacent to the old. Economic sites have been submitted and their suitability recognised, but they have been rejected because it has been found inadvisable to divorce manu-facture from the old geographical location to which a goodwill attaches in the mind of the consumer. Many other difficulties have been experienced, but the outstanding fact has to be re-cognised that there is, speaking generally, a definite feeling against establishing new enterprises in distressed areas where the product has to be marketed outside. When it is suitable for marketing inside, the prospects for local trade are considered bad. Manufacturers are not prepared to take the risk of the disadvantages they rightly or wrongly associate with the Areas, whose very distress reacts unfavourably on their prospects. This barrier has to be broken clown before a start to reconstruct can be made. How can the Areas attract trade instead of repelling it? I can see but one way out and that is to create a local de-mand for local production. If critics say that this proposal is impracticable, I shall not be impressed, but if they will put forward proposals better designed to improve conditions in the Special Areas, I shall rejoice. Whatever the theoretical objections to thus expanding industry within the Areas, once a practical start is made, outside capital and enterprise will be attracted. There is much, truth in the saying &quot; Trade brings trade &quot;. The foundation of the proposal lies in the fact that these Areas still have a considerable population with a powerful, if diminished, spending power. They have in their own hands a lever which can be applied to create a market for locally pro-duced goods. It can be used to dislodge distress if sufficient energy and courage are displayed in the right way. Before dis-cussing how this can be done, let us glance back at the past history of the Areas; we shall then see why there is justification for hope.30564. e 3
202. Ofte^ha^-Ji&apos;b?eh&apos;&apos;as^e(3&apos;tiie&apos;.&apos;gpestid&apos;n: is. there any hope for the revival of these Areas? It has been difficult to give an answer.&apos; To sev. the/picture/cheaply,, it is necessary, to step back, free of the welter, of ^distress and depression, and borrow light from the past,to /illumine the.present; when fhis is done, the answer comeg^with conyiption that ,fhei;e is hope for the Special Areas. What, does the past.reveal ?&apos; districts unusually, favoured with the endowment,,by, nature, of much latent wealth; unde-developed it was worthless.. \ If,was not the. Government or the big London banks that; prppjured Its development and brought about prosperity. /^his/w^s&apos; achieved by- the enterprise, the. foresight and courage pflindiyiduals..,It was.the result of their effort and of their work that.

The necessity for,spreading,the risk wider was not apparent in years of prosperity;;, it,.only became so with the advent of adversity. It is easy to be wise after the event, to see now that there were too many eggs in one basket and too much dependence on heavy industries. Adversity replaced prosperity, the fall was heavy, so. heavy fhat ithpse, Areas are stunned and weakened by the shock. . In thjs, Hong/ition, it is not surprising that there is a tendency to depend on outside help, to feel that weakness makes reconstruction impossible. Their overwhelming difficulties are fully, realised, by the,country at large. Sympathy is daily being turned into practical help.. The Government has given the &quot;lead; gradual revival can come, but the primary effort must be made from&apos;within.:) :.&apos;1 *;203. I am hopeful for the future of the Special Areas because I believe that the Enterprise and courage which brought about past prosperity are not dead; they may be dormant, but can be re-awakenecl and will gradually bring back prosperity. There are still operating many successful industries producing goods whose excellence of quality is universally acknowledged. There are still industrial, leaders of outstanding ability, although a few are somewhat unbending in their attitude to labour. The workers are second to,hone, but some of their leaders must realise that it is more important to secure conditions which will favour the flow of work into the districts than to insist on minor adjust-ments of rates and conditions. However, my hopes of future revival are not: based only on the good-qualities of industrialists and workers. - They are further based on the fact that the Areas have, within their.own borders, a considerable population with large powers of consumption. Here is a definite market which can be supplied largely by production within the Areas.
m 81204. The loss of turnover in the heavy industries must be made good by the expansion of the light industries and by the production of every local need. There is no reason why the more favourably situated industrial districts in these Areas should not enjoy a degree of prosperity, equal in relation to their popula-tion, to that enjoyed by industries in the south. If success for the proposal is to be secured, it is essential that the whole-hearted support of the inhabitants should be shown practically. They must purchase from those taking the risk of producing for their requirements. A crusade is needed to make all inhabitants of these Areas feel it is their bounden duty to support local industries, which must be assured of a market. Let us assume an increased spirit of enterprise and the determination to pull through. How shall a start be made? A big drive will be needed, but it must have a spearhead to penetrate the obstacles. Effective representative leadership must be secured, leadership which will invoke enthusiasm. Industrialists, trade unions and the Churches must get to work; each must play his part. There must be created a nucleus of power and influence to plan, to organise and, above all, to give confidence; for this last, there is the greatest need. Once those in the Areas demonstrate that they have regained full confidence in themselves, they will com-mand the confidence of others. The machine is ready to start working., It is to local development councils that we must look, but they must be strengthened and receive such wide and whole-hearted support that they can confidently tackle the heavy task. A campaign must be instituted to make every man and woman feel that they are essential to the success of the scheme and are neglecting their duty if they do not buy locally. Pledges must be obtained and a feeling created that every purchase of locally produced goods, however small, brings some relief to distress.205. Once the difficulties of making a start are overcome the acceleration of the pace becomes easier. Opportunity for practical assistance is increased. If my powers further to assist the councils are insufficient, I will approach the Government, but the money must first be spent in developing the home markets of these Areas. Publicity and propaganda will be needed to create a local market for the products of industries which the development councils will help to extend and to establish.206. My message to the Special Areas is that they can break the vicious circle of distress if a determined effort is made on the lines suggested. I fully appreciate that the transmission from adversity to prosperity will take time and it will call for patience and endurance.207. Meanwhile, it is essential that all excess burdens of the Special Area should be placed on the broad shoulders of the Nation.   They are denuded of much of their domestic and30564 e 4
foreign trade and their weakness has been produced by causes beyond their control. They must be steadily and continuously helped from without whilst they are effecting recuperation from within; all measures of relief should be continued.208. The gradual revival of trade will prove a magnet of sufficient power to attract capital;&apos;to these Areas, which must steadily be helped to help themselves. Herein lies hope for the making of a start to regain prosperity and banish distress.. Government orders and factories209. It is sometimes suggested that the Government should manufacture its own requirements and construct factories in the Special Areas. Efficiency is best secured by the Government placing out its orders rather than manufacturing itself, but when doing so it should whenever possible, with due regard to price and quality, place contracts with firms in the Special Areas. Generally speaking, it possesses no factories under its direct control apart from Woolwich Arsenal, the removal of which is under consideration. If it were decided that the production of aircraft should be decentralised for the obtaining of greater security, I trust that the Government would insist on factories being placed in the Special Areas where this is justified.Land Settlement210. Many people have assured me that land settlement would provide a cute for unemployment. They simplify the problem by assuming that the transit of the unemployed to the land is just an easy walkover; as though&apos;successful cultivators of the soil could be mass-produced, yet they must well know that train-ing and experience are needed to make a successful butcher, baker or candlestick maker, and it takes some years to turn out a fully competent bricklayer, carpenter or fitter.211. The relief which will accrue from my schemes will indeed appear diminutive compared with the anticipation created by some colossal figures quoted. If vast numbers could in fact be settled on the land, the economic consequences and reactions would make the effort inadvisable. For many reasons, some of which I have already endeavoured to explain, land settlement is a process which must be developed with care and caution. If it is thus carried out it should prove a helpful contribution to the solution of the problem of unemployment, but its effects will be slowly felt.212. In settling my land policy I have been actuated by one clear motive, and that is to make the conditions as attractive as possible to prospective settlers. Unemployed men cannot be forced on to the land, so doing would only lead to failure.
Aptitude and inclination for the hard work involved are neces-sary to success, which cannot be obtained without the following essential conditions:(i) Provision of capital for stock and equipment. (2) The acquisition of suitable land. (3) The procuring and training of the right type of man. (4) An efficient marketing organisation  for the products grown.213. Never before in the history of this country, or possibly of any other, have such liberal terms been offered to facilitate settlement on the land. It appeared to me better for the State to make a generous gift right out and establish conditions which should lead to success, rather than put such a weight of debt on the settlers as would be likely to cause failure, with the result that the State would hereafter have to write off a considerable capital loss. Assistance has been offered on such attractive terms that no suitable unemployed man from the Special Areas, who has the inclination and enterprise to make a fresh start in life and work on the land, need hesitate to come forward and avail of the opportunity of gaining independence and a livelihood.214. All the schemes referred to in Part IV of the Report are designed to train the prospective settler so that he can become independent and self-supporting, but I am anxious also to make experiments with regard to co-operative profit sharing schemes which engage the services of the cultivator, supervise the work and organise the marketing of the produce. The model scheme of this type is that adopted by the Fordson Estates Limited at Boreham, Essex, which in the initial stages has met with success. Land settlement is one of the most helpful methods which should be employed to reduce unemployment, but we shall be misled if we think that it can be effected quickly or on a large scale.National works215. The impression formed from references made in the House of Commons to Relief Works is that these two words have become a catch phrase used with insufficient accuracy of definition and, further, as if the question whether there should be any capital expenditure on public works could be dealt with by an unconditional answer. The issue has been over-related to a particular period when too much money was spent, some of it certainly in the wrong way, and much of it at the wrong time. This, however, need not sterilise effort to spend some-thing in the right way at the right time. Capital expenditure can be made wisely as well as wastefully.   If we spend wisely
within our means, and there is opportunity so to do if funds are available, the State gains apart from relief to unemploy-ment. If we overspend, whatever may be the value of&apos; the objective, reactions are set up. which tend to increase unemploy-ment, although the loss made is not represented by the total expenditure on materials and wages. We must assume the passing of a credit note to the State for the amount which would have been paid in allowances had the work not been undertaken. The value of this credit note is greater than the money saved in allowances for there must be added the valuable but intangible asset represented by the gain to the unemployed of work in-stead of idleness. The ratio of wages to total expenditure on public works is often low; therefore, it is essential that value should be secured to the State for its capital outlay. However, the prior determination of principles of policy is needed. The crux of the problem lies in the determination of what can be afforded. It is not for me to say what the Nation can afford, but I have propounded a formula which I should apply if I had to settle the question, and I should be prepared to take a reason-able risk in its application. The road to action is seldom hedged with safety all the way, but success will usually favour a policy of which the consequences can be calculated to a reasonable de-gree. The formula is that the amount of money, if any, avail-able for the prosecution of justifiable national works, after satisfying the requirements of the more essential services, must be less than the amount which would bring up the total of ex-penditure to such a figure as would react adversely on the national position and tend to decrease employment.216. It is difficult to assume that nothing can be made avail-able for spending on national works. Is there not a reasoned case for such expenditure on its merits apart from any question of relief to unemployment ? Is there not to-day the need for the creation of national physical assets to replace those inherited from the past, which are steadily declining in value as the ad-yance of science and the increased knowledge of its application makes them daily more obsolete? Is not their replacement in many cases overdue and if undertaken with vision could not we assist the expansion of industry, which would bring increased general prosperity and decreased unemployment ? If any policy of national works is adopted, priority should be given to schemes which most readily lend themselves to the absorption of the un-employed (particularly unskilled men) and the obtaining of materials from the Special Areas.Transference out of the Special Areas217. Industrial transference, already wisely undertaken, must be pressed further.. It has been suggested how this can be strengthened and, in addition, a measure of protection given to
the workers when new industries are being established. I have already recommended that a survey should be made to deter-mirie the relative industrial;.-^in the Special AreasWhen :%ich report is. available, transfer should be intensively applied to the areas-adjudged to have no industrial or economic future and relaxed in-the. case of those with better prospects.&apos; , . &apos;218. Love of home, pride of nationality and local associations, however desirable in themselves, furnish.&apos;no adequate justifica-tion for leading a maimed life. Many youths, and girls are fast growing up who have never done a day&apos;s work and for whom there is no prospect of work. The essential rule&apos; of life that applies to the ordinary individual and requires him to take up his abode where work is to be found, and not to expect the work to come to him, should apply equally where there is a number of unemployed. Some will say there are few districts devoid of any unemployment. This is not challenged,, but there are im-portant areas where unemployment is slight and some where there is a shortage of skilled workers. If commonsense is exercised, it becomes obvious that the small disadvantage accruing-ing to the more prosperous districts from an accession of unem-ployed from the Special Areas is trivial compared with the advantages gained by the districts suffering from intense unem-ployment. Infusion into the industrial life stream of the Nation is essential if the Special Areas are to be relieved, and a mixture of blood will improve our stock. Whatever the forebodings as to the result of the movement south, no artificial or natural readjustment or control of the flow of industrial activity can be effected in time to save the workless youth of the Special Areas. To continue them in their existing surroundings will prove fatal to their own interests and disastrous nationally. Derelict areas are sores in the body politic. If succour cannot be given them, their unemployed inhabitants must be moved to healthier districts. The Ministry of Labour is making a determined effort to transfer young persons into areas affording better opportunities. Inducements are offered and after care provided to banish homesickness. The acceptance of suitable employment when offered should not be optional; there should be an obliga-tion on an unemployed man to take suitable work. The State cannot be expected to shoulder the burden of maintaining un-conditionally men at home in idleness when such work or opportunities of getting it are declined.219. Recognition of the patience and fortitude with which the vast majority of the unemployed bear their sufferings is not diminished because measures are advocated to discourage a small minority of those capable of work from becoming habitually idle, such measures to be based on a definite; refusal of work.
Is it not equitable to differentiate between the man who accepts work and the man who rejects work ? The acceptance of money for maintenance from public funds should create in the mind of the recipient a sense of obligation to the State in return for the protection it gives. Human nature varies widely. Some like work for work&apos;s sake; most find an incentive which is often for-gotten in the joy of accomplishment. In every class of society there are some who are not very well, not very ill and not very inclined to work. Health and happiness are still to be found in the application of that saying from a wise and ancient Book: &quot; By the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat thy bread &quot;.220. Under present conditions, transference from the Special Areas must be mainly to industrial employment in other parts of Great Britain, where better opportunities exist than in these areas. But it is to be hoped that the time will soon come when transference to the British Empire overseas will be resumed. Whilst the problem of migration should be considered indepen-dently of that of unemployment, the effect of the cessation of overseas settlement must be studied. It is remarkable that, in spite of the progress made with rationalisation and mechanisation of industry, there should be more people at work in Great Britain at the present time than ever before in the history of our Country. Immediately before the War, we were sending over 300,000 people every year to other parts of the Empire; since 1931&quot;, the inward flow has exceeded the outward flow by some 25,000 a year. The effect on the number seeking employ-ment is obvious. If in the three years 1931 to 1933, there had been the same emigration as in 1911 to 1913, there would have been a million fewer people in this country. The Dominions have their own unemployment problems, but on any long-term policy of Imperial development it is hoped they will look for a constant supply of British settlers, and I trust the earliest oppor-tunity will be taken to re-open with the Dominions negotiations for resumption of Empire migration.221. Recruitment for the Services of the State offers oppor-tunity for a healthy career and a good chance of employment when service is ended. It meets with little response in the Special Areas; indeed, in some quarters the mention of it is resented and misinterpreted. Surely this is a wrongful attitude. The needs of these areas are such that there is no room for dis-encouragement of any offer leading to employment or a career. I would like to see leaders in these areas use their influence to secure the placing before young men without prospects of em-ployment the advantages of joining one of the services. There is no justification for confusing action thus taken with advocacy of conscription.
Practical and physical training of youthLater entry into industry222. If a policy of economic development of the home market is pursued, there is a prospect of further trade expansion. Already in some industries there is a shortage of skilled men. Apprenticeships have to a considerable extent died out. I would far rather see a lad apprenticed to a trade at fifteen and study at evening classes than kept at school. The chances and oppor-tunities of life are definitely increased by the practical knowledge of a trade and the discipline inculcated through apprenticeship. The difficulty is that, with the increase in mechanisation, there has been a decrease in the demand for skilled men, accompanied by a decline in apprenticeships, but an increase in the demand for semi-skilled men. Excellent training work is being done by the Ministry of Labour at the various centres set up. It is hoped the numbers dealt with will increase as industry revives. There should be a conference between industrialists and the trade unions to see what can be done to re-establish apprenticeships. However, any improvement which can be effected in this direc-tion will prove insufficient. The opportunity for definite occupa-tion and practical and physical training of the youth of this country is altogether inadequate.223. If the problem is conceived in simple terms it becomes obvious that the primary requirement is to close the gap of un-employment and by so doing open wider the door to employ-ment in industry. In practice this means that at one end of the scale we must reduce the number of boys and girls at work and at the other end retire at an earlier age those who are older. What real justification is there for employing raw youth and the aged when, between these extremes, there is a vast number of unemployed from sixteen years of age and upwards, single and married, daily seeking work ? The first step is to take those of from fourteen to sixteen years of age out of industry, making their employment illegal. What are we to do with them ? I do not not suggest they should continue at school in the generally accepted sense. Those who show exceptional ability can take advantage of the opportunities offered by the secondary schools, but the remainder should be given a compulsory practical train-ing: a system of general training should be devised to fit a boy for practical work in industry. Every boy should learn to use his hands, to use a plumb line and a straight edge, and do a bit of simple levelling. At the same time, he should acquire a further knowledge of arithmetic, of elementary physics, and some knowledge of those things which give an interest in mother earth beyond that of putting a spade into her. The useful and happy influence in after life of peeps into science taken when young cannot be over-estimated.   Their impression will outlast
any book learning acquired under the present system of educa-tion, so much of which is so soon forgotten. Our young people should, learn of the, Empire and be imbued with the spirit of enterprise, which.is already dwindling in those who are drifting; they should be inspired with courage to take risks which lead to work anywhere. If, on attaining the age of sixteen, a boy should be unable to find a place in industry, then the existing provision for his training operates until the age of eighteen, but I should like him to continue the practical and physical training already outlined. If, at eighteen, work is not found, surely unemployment will be better endured with some acquisition of manual dexterity. When work offers, it increases opportunity and, if work fails, knowledge of how to use one&apos;s hands increases self-reliance and gives a chance of indulging in a hobby. Prac-tical training of this character instead of the repetition work usually engaged in at a factory would enlarge the outlook, stimulate enterprise and give an increased opportunity to do good, and successful work, whether at home or in the Dominions.224. An essential feature of the proposal is that there must be given concurrently an intensive physical training and the fullest opportunity for open air sports. A healthy body will help deftness of hand and quickness of brain. Discipline can be acquired, and an improved morale achieved. Thus can we reduce the high percentage of those in Class 3 and make the next generation healthier and better equipped citizens. Who can deny the outstanding benefits which would accrue to youths from fourteen to sixteen thus given a continuous practical and physical training during these two difficult years of adolescence, instead of working in a factory or office?; It is difficult to estimate the gain. Some will say cheap labour is essential; power to compete will be diminished, particularly in the ex-port markets. My answer is, these difficulties must be faced; the price being paid for their continuance is too high. The burden on industry of social services should not be measured in terms of the conditions existing before the advantages of tariffs were available. A share of the benefits which protection affords to industry should be passed on to the workers and their children. These youths of under sixteen years must be eman-cipated. Eighteen years of age is the limit for night work. Sixteen years must in future be the limit for day work. It is a clear step on the path of progress which should be taken without delay.225. The advantages outweigh the disadvantages, which can be overcome by readjustment of current practice. The benefits which would accrue to youth must not be withheld or the oppor-tunity for increased employment lost. Let us give the girls a similar chance, but particularly train them for domestic life; teach them to cook, the value of different foods and to sew.
They should be kept out of domestic service, out of factories and shops, up to sixteen. It is thus proposed that boys and girls should receive equality of treatment and that their training should be compulsory, boys to be excepted only where a definite indenture of apprenticeship has been entered into, and girls where an urgent claim to keep them at home can be established.226. It is suggested that a special Government Department should be created, responsible to the most appropriate Minister, to give effect to these proposals. It would provide for the practical and physical training of the youth of the country from fourteen to sixteen, and up to eighteen where work is not found. Training shops and classrooms would have to be built and equipped. Gymnasiums, swimming baths and playgrounds would be needed. The provision of these would require funds, but fewer additions to schools should be necessary. The work to be carried out would involve less effort than that made in the War to construct Government factories. Where prospects of employment in the Special Areas do not warrant the equip-ment of training centres, youths from these areas must be trans-ferred and maintained where better opportunity offers. The universities could help by training a special class of suitable instructors and teachers, but the greatest need will be to get the right type of foreman in the training shops, as nothing makes such an impression on boys as the ability to demonstrate to them in practice how to make something. The effort to do this stimulates self-reliance, the power to create and the power to invent.227. An additional advantage of this recommendation is that it would enable all young persons up to the age of sixteen to remain under constant medical supervision. From sixteen on-wards, the Health Insurance Acts operate, but at present there is for most young persons a deplorable absence of medical service between the ages of fourteen and sixteen, two of the most critical years of life.Contributory pensions and earlier retirement from industry228. The gap at the other end can be closed by lowering the age of retirement from industry, which it is not advocated should be compulsory. This will further reduce unemployment in the country generally and thereby facilitate the transfer of persons from the Special Areas. I should, therefore, like to see an addition to the contributory pensions scheme so that the pension payable at the age of 65 would be increased to such a figure as would make retirement possible without dependence on other resources. The receipt of this additional pension should, how-ever, be conditional on definite retirement from work.
9Q        .229. There are now nearly 700,000 people in work over the age of 65 and, if only one-third of these availed of this induce-ment to retire, there would be a big field opened for the employ-ment of younger people.    -- tMaintenance of morale230. Whatever degree of direct or indirect relief is afforded, however quickly or slowly it may come, there will remain an outstanding necessity for a continued and determined effort to maintain the morale of the unemployed where good, and im-prove it where indifferent. Here is a work which can be furthered without waiting. I have not hesitated to strengthen the good wOrk being done by social services.231. Nutrition may be found for the body, but the majority of those expecting work which is not forthcoming suffer mentally to a far greater degree than is generally realised. One of my most painful experiences was to watch, unknown, the unem-ployed queue up at an Exchange to draw their allowances. Whatever agreement or disagreement there may be amongst medical experts as to malnutrition, it is quite certain that any person with average powers of observation, who studied the faces of those men, could not fail to see that there is something definitely wrong. I cannot say what diagnosis the doctors would make, but the trouble is obviously mental. The ineffaceable impression was given that the men were seriously suffering from being overwrought and were worn out by anxiety.232. Bad as is the plight of these men, there is something even worse and that is the sight of boys idling at the street corners who have never done a day&apos;s work and for whom there is little prospect of employment. They are steadily deteriorating through enforced idleness.Preferential treatment for employment up to 21233. It has been proposed that specialised practical and physical training should be given to those of from 14 to 16 and, if unemployed, up to 18. I have stated that these youths equipped with a practical training and physically fit will, if work is denied them at 18 years of age, be better able to endure unemployment. This is undoubtedly true, but it is not the fate I Visualise for most of them. I should give those of the Special Areas with a good record preferential freatnient for employment out of the areas up to the age of 21, when they must fend for themselves. Some displacement may be involved. Parents have to make sacrifices for. their children. Is it wrong that the State should calk for a sacrifice, to help save the youth of the . Special Areas?    .-.    . ...
It is suggested that a national appeal should be made on the lines of the King&apos;s Roll.Shorter working hours234. Shorter working hours can clearly contribute to the re-duction of unemployment. Their effect will be much less than is generally anticipated, as every reduction furnishes an incentive which will successfully bring about an increased degree of mechanisation.The circumstances and conditions of work applying when say 56J hours were worked, were far different from those applying at the institution of the 48 hour week, which in particular largely abolished the ineffective before breakfast period.235. A reduction to say 42 or 40 hours will prove relatively much more difficult to attain.The workers do not wish for any reduction below 48 hours at the price of their taking home less at the end of the week. Their attitude is reasonable and, where standard rates of pay are in force, I see no justification for asking them to sacrifice their standard of living. Further, so doing would bring about a re-duction of spending power.236. Shorter working hours cannot be applied successfully to industry generally.We must feel our way one industry at a time. Even then, the industry must be sufficiently organised and have the power to make its decisions binding on all its members.237. The critical issue lies in determining who should make good the extra charge involved. The main burden of cost occurs during the transitional period, whilst manufacturers are adap-ting their organisations to&apos; tbe new conditions arid seeking, through mechanisation, to attain the costs current prior to reduction of hours.I suggest that the manufacturers should bear one moiety of the cost and the Government should offer to bear the other over a period of say three years on a downward sliding scale. If the hours were reduced from 48 to 42, which is exactly a fourth of 168 (the hours of the week), the increased wages cost would be say 15 per cent. Of this the Government might bear 7^ per cent, in the first year, 5 per cent, in the,second, per cent, the third- It would be necessary to establish a pre-reduc-tion of hours standard for: comparison, so that the amount of additional, wages paid would be strictly related ,to the reduced hours worked. This could be furnished by each firm or com-pany&apos;s chartered accountants, on whose certificate quarterly payments could be made.   A scheme on this basis would en-
courage a trial of shorter working hours by any industry sufficiently organised to make it effective and the cost to the Government would be justified by the opportunity furnished for decreased unemployment.238. No effective reduction of the number of unemployed will come about except through simultaneously applying every reasonable remedy. Empirical methods must be tried out where there is but little experience available on which to form a policy.A week&apos;s holiday with pay239. Another direction in which a small increase of employ-ment could be effected would be the making compulsory of a week&apos;s holiday with pay for all workers continuously in employ-ment for one year with the same firm or company. I have never been able to understand why the man who works with his coat off is not as much entitled to a holiday as the man who works with it on. Many firms are now giving a week&apos;s holiday with pay to their workers and it is time that an effort was made to give this privilege to all.General Principles240. Parliament defined the Special Areas and resolved that they should receive special treatment. The policy on which this is being given has been laid down by me and approval of it obtained. Whilst the Act does not permit the application of fundamental remedies, an effort has been made to give wisely such relief as is practicable within its terms. The effect of the assistance afforded in many directions, and of the grants made, should be increasingly felt and prove of permanent ad-vantage to the Special Areas. I have endeavoured to visualise the full extent of the difficulties which these areas may en-counter; should some of them dissipate, the remainder will be the more easily dealt with. The principles on which my recommendations are based may be broadly summarised as follows:241. I am of the opinion that the outstanding need is to establish conditions whereby industry will be attracted to in-stead of repelled from these areas. It is suggested that the effort to start the process should be initiated from within by the creation of local markets to be supplied by local production. Capital will increasingly be attracted as local conditions im-prove. To support local initial effort, it will be necessary for the Government to make financial grants to influential and widely representative development councils in order to give them every opportunity of planning reconstruction. Whilst this is being effected, the areas must be relieved of all excess burdens and the special measures now being applied continued and strengthened.  Resident district commissioners are essential
to watch over the interests of the areas on behalf of the Govern-ment, to further local co-operation and to secure co-ordination in all fields of activity.242. Every local effort made and assistance that can be given under the Act must be supplemented by the adoption of wider Government measures designed to; reduce unemployment generally, and thereby make easier the application of all remedies instituted for the relief of the Special Areas. Some of the measures advocated will call for considerable expenditure. How otherwise is relief to be afforded ?243. My endeavour has been to ascertain the facts with regard to these areas and clearly to state the conclusions arrived at, regardless of whether they will prove palatable or distasteful. If some of these conclusions point to the imminence of in-creased difficulties, they should be accepted as a call for speedy action and not as evidence of pessimism.244. Meanwhile, I trust the experience gained and the ex--periments made will prove helpful. The problem must not be allowed to drift into the category of those that are insoluble. We must not be content to remain baffled and defeated. All I claim for the proposals submitted is that they indicate where a start can be made. The problem of the Special Areas cannot be successfully solved without the application of some uncon-conventional principles.4th July, 1935.Broadway Buildings, Broadway, London, S.W.t.

Memorandum prepared by the Durham County Council for issue to prospective trainees for settlement on small-holdings provided by the Council for unemployed persons.SMALL HOLDINGS AND ALLOTMENTS ACTS, 1908-192 6 SPECIAL  AREAS   (DEVELOPMENT  AND  IMPROVEMENT)   ACT,1934-MEMORANDUM FOR THE GUIDANCE OF SETTLERS.The County Council of Durham, acting in conjunction with the Commissioner for the Special Areas (England and Wales) and the Minister of Labour, are prepared, with a view to the settlement of unemployed men upon the land, to provide the necessary land and equipment.A sum not exceeding  260 will be spent by the Council in respect of working capital for each settler. The County Council will provide nstruction in methods of cultivation and in the care of stock ;   and all
dDatebuying and marketing will be on a co-operative basis. The assistance and advice of the County CounciFs technical staff will be available at all times to assist the settlers.The scheme falls into two parts :  (1) A preliminary period of twelve months during which persons selected to participate in the scheme will be regarded as under training and will, subject to the general provisions of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1934, and the Regulations and Rules made there-under, receive training allowances from the Unemployment Assistance Board ;  and(2) The option when the period of training has been satisfactorily com-pleted, to rent a holding from the County Council.The conditions which will apply  during the preliminary period of training are as follows : (1) There will be no financial obligations of any kind as between the County Council and the trainee and the latter will be liable to be dismissed at any time should his conduct prove unsatisfactory. (2) All produce raised during this period will belong to the County Council, and no trainee will be permitted to sell any part of the produce raised by him ; but he will be allowed to take away a reasonable amount for the personal requirements of himself and his family. The County Council propose at the end of the period, but without entering into any binding obligation in the mattet, to distribute amongst those trainees who satisfactorily complete their period of training any profits realised by the sale of produce during the preliminary period, after deducting necessary expenditure including a reasonable charge for the cost of land for the year. The method of distribution will be such as may seem fairest to the Council and the Commissioner. (3) Trainees must comply in all respects with any directions which may from time to time be given by or on behalf of the supervisor. (4) It is intended that in the normal case trainees should continue to reside in their own homes.    In the case of a scheme where the Council provides a dwelling house, the trainee will be required to pay a house rent from the commencement of his period of training.If any trainee, after satisfactorily completing his period of training, desires to remain in the scheme, he will be required : (1) To enter into a tenancy agreement approved by the Council in respect of his holding and to pay for it an annual rent of  000 for the land (and  000 for the dwelling-house) ; and (2) To enter into an agreement for the repayment by instalments of one-half of the sum of  260 mentioned above. This repayment will commence at the beginning of the third year from the com-mencement of training and will be at the rate of 5s. per week for the ensuing ten years. As soon as  130 in all has been repaid, all liability on the part of the settler in respect of the capital advance will cease ; no interest will be charged on the amount outstanding for the time being.Selected candidates will be required, by signing a copy of this Memorandum, to signify their knowledge of and willingness to abide by, the above conditions.Signature of trainee .................................Address ................................................

Need for Private Help.The Commissioners Request.To the Editor of &quot; The Times.&quot; Sir,There is a danger that subscriptions which have been generously given in the past to assist the various organisations engaged in the work of social service may fall off now that the Government has undertaken to assist directly the depressed areas.My attention has been drawn to this possibility, and I am most anxious to lay stress on two points in connection with this matter.First, the magnitude of the task of succouring these areas, so hard-hit by causes beyond the control of those whose lot it is to live in them, is such that a national effort must be made to ameliorate their conditions. Assistance from private sources is needed in addition to measures under-taken by the Government. Therefore will all kindly-disposed persons help to the utmost of their ability one or other of the various agencies promoting social and voluntary work ? Secondly, will any of those contemplating giving assistance to any of these areas, other than through existing organisations, be so good as to get into communication with me or with Mr. C. Forbes Adam, District Commissioner for Depressed Areas, Durham and Tyneside, at Pilgrim House, Pilgrim Street, Newcastle-on-Tyne, or with Captain Geoffrey Crawshay, District Commissioner for Depressed Areas of South Wales, Principality Buildings, Queen Street, Cardiff, in order that advice may be given as to the best means of making effective their good intentions ?Further, I would point out that, while it is proposed to give me powers to accept gifts, legacies, etc., it.is not my intention to make any appeal for such. I am, therefore, most anxious that the fullest support should be given to all organisations working for the welfare of the depressed areas.I am, yours very truly,(Sgd.) P. Malcolm Stewart,Commissioner jor the Depressed, Areas (England and Wales).Temporary Address : Broadway Buildings, Broadway,Westminster, S.W.i.13^ December, 1934.(30564 38)   Wt. 1310 3117   90   7/35   p. st.   g. 373
