tTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTE78Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1935.SECRET. Copy No. 46CP. 135 (35).CABINET.AIR  PACT  AND  AIR  LIMITATION  AGREEMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.1. THE Cabinet will recollect that at their meeting on the 26th June they agreed that the Minister for League of Nations Affairs should be authorised to conduct his conversations in Paris with the French Foreign Minister regarding the Air Pact and an Air Limitation Agreement on the following basis. Without tying the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Government on either point, Mr. Eden could take note of the two conditions on which he had previously reported that the French Government would participate in the negotiations : *(a) That the Air Pact was completed by bilateral military arrangements which might be between several pairs of Powers, but must include one between France and the United Kingdom, and(b) That the Air Pact and Limitation Agreement could not become operativeuntil agreement had also been reached on the other subjects mentioned in the declaration of the 3rd February, viz., Eastern Pact, Danubian Pact and limitation of land armaments.2. On the first point accompaniment of the Air Pact by a bilateral military arrangement at least between France and the United Kingdom Mr. Eden&apos;s report shows that M. Laval was very stiff. He indicated that without a bilateral arrangement the Air Pact would be of little use to the French Government. M. Laval said that for France the value of the Air Pact was the provision for immediate assistance which she did not enjoy under Locarno. An undertaking for immediate assistance would be of no avail unless mechanism was provided in advance for its rendering. That was why a bilateral military arrangement was indispensable. It was in return for an advantage of this kind, which France did not enjoy under the Locarno Treaty, that she was prepared to give the United Kingdom a guarantee which she did not give in the Locarno Treaty.3. There can at the moment be no question of committing this country to anything in the nature of a separate military alliance with France. Such a commitment would be in direct contradiction to the spirit of reciprocity towards France and Germany which underlies the proposal for the Air Pact just as much as the Locarno Treaty. On the other hand, objection need not necessarily be taken to the proposal for providing between this country and France what in practic will only be the technical machinery necessary for rendering the Air Pact effective, on condition that similar machinery is provided between ourselves and Germany.4. The Cabinet is accordingly asked to approve the following reply to M. Laval&apos;s request about the accompaniment of the Air Pact by bilateral military arrangements. His Majesty&apos;s Government would not merely take note of the French Governments requirement that the Air Pact shall be accompanied by a bilateral military arrangement at least between the United Kingdom and France; but would themselves be prepared to agree to the accompaniment of the Air Pact8016   [11820]
by a bilateral arrangement containing such technical provisions as might be agreed to be necessary for rendering it effective as between this country and France. This would be on the understanding that His Majesty&apos;s Government will propose a similar agreement between the United Kingdom and Germany, and naturally between the United Kingdom and Belgium.In return the French Government will be asked not to object to the immediate initiation of discussions between all the Locarno Powers, with a view to the negotiation (as distinct from the conclusion) of an Air Pact and Air Limitation Agreement.[N.B. If and when this communication is made to the French Government, it will be important that they should not be led to believe that we have in any way agreed to the technical provisions which they have suggested as suitable for inclusion in the arrangement.]5. As regards the second condition, Mr. Eden reports that M. Laval seemed on the whole less uncompromising than at the previous interview. In appearance he continued to insist on the conclusion of a general settlement including the Eastern Pact, the Danubian Pact and more especially limitation of land armaments as a condition of the entry into force of the Air Pact and an Air Limitation Agreement. On the other hand, Mr. Eden had the impression that if we could agree now to the accompaniment of the Air Pact by a bilateral arrange-ment at least between this country and France, it was just possible that the French Government would be willing not only to enter upon negotiations for an Air Pact apd air limitation, but even to conclude them without the further condition that the agreements on these subjects should not come into force until agreement had been reached on land armaments, though they would, of course, at present give no such undertaking.6. In these circumstances it is not considered necessary to pursue this second point further with the French Government for the moment; though they will be again assured that it is still the wish of His Majesty&apos;s Government to see the conclusion of the General Settlement as outlined in the London Declaration, and, in order the better to work.for its attainment, they hold that, as far as possible, negotiations with regard to the different elements in that General Settlement should be initiated and carried on simultaneously.S. H.Foreign Office, July 2, 1935.
