(This Boeoment is the property of His Britannic Majesty5 sGovernment) igopjr got   *   &apos;g K C H K T cabinet proposed Memorial to the Viacso-ont Grey of Fallodon Memorandum &quot;by the&apos; First Cotunissioher of Wor&amp;SoX am sorry to haw to trouhlo ay colleagues with the following matter-&apos;;,Towards the end of last year a committee of Me friends was. formed with the object- of erecting a memorial to Lord Orey of FallodGKu, several members of the present Cabinet being members of it0     A. siifo-committee of this &quot;body have had several discussions with me on. the subject of a suitable site for the memorialo     They are naturally desirous that it should he in the noigKbota?hood of the Houses of Parliament and the- Foreign Office as &quot;being the scenes of Lord G-reyss public. work.       Under the ten years rule the Houses of Parliament and the Abbey are for the time &quot;being eliminated from consideration!       Other sites in Westminster are hard to come fcy:, hut the following suggestions hare been made*(1) The memorial might take the form of a bust to be placed in the raeant niche at the head of the first flight of stairs on the main staircase in the Foreign Office,This proposal was at first welcomed by representatives of the Committee? hut it was later rejected by them on the grounds that any memorial within the walls of the Foreign Office would not he seen hy the public at larges  Old the Committee pressed accordingly for some site out of
(8) A medallion, might be placed in the wall of the Foreign Office opposite the foot of the Downing Street steps beside the side do op which Lord G-rey always used to use,     The medallion could include the head of Lord G-rey in low relief as well as a suitable inscription     It would meet the eye of every person who passed down the Downing Street steps0(3) A proposal? which I understand emanated from the minds of Lord Crawford and Sir Edwin Lutyens, has been now put forward that a bust of Lord drey with a stone architectural surround should be placed in the centre of the wall of the garden of 11?Downing Street facing StoJames8e Park0     A design for this has? in faets been prepared by Sir Edwin Lutyensa the suggestion being that the bust should be in Roman stone and the surround . in Portland stones       X have discussed this at length with Lord Howard;, Lord Tyrrell? Lord Rhayader and MrcEL J0 Tennant, representing the Committee? and pointed out to them the grave objections to which in my view this proposal is subject.,     The wall of the Downing Street garden may not be an object of beauty j, but it is homely and unaffected^ and for its purpose as a garden wall it is simple and appropriate,,     To make in it a gap of alien material creates a disturbance and is discordant with the character of the wallo     The Kitchener memorial on the north wall is, in my opinion, frankly ridiculous j, ands in short? to make the wall a repository for further memorials of any kind would seem to me unfortunate in the extremooIn spite of my objections to (3) I had invited the observations of the Royal Fine Art Commission on all three sites, indicating to the Commission as my own personal views what seemed to me the inapproprlateness of the garden wall Bo
site: and I informed the Memorial Committee that if the Royal Commission were prepared to assent in principle to the garden wall proposal I would be prepared to submit the qxxestion to the Cabinet for consideration.The Royal Fine Art Commission have now set forth their -views on the above proposals as follows:-&quot;They take note of the opinion expressed by the First Commissioner that the proposed erection of a memorial to Lord Grey of Fallodon, on the Downing Street garden wall;, is considered inappropriate.,     While the Commissioners think that such a position need not be unbecoming* and that the size, material and treatment of the monument could be so arranged as to preclude any sense of confusion or competition in relation to the Kitchener statue, they have now considered the alternative sites available0They understand that it is out of the question for the Committee to raise enough funds to order a full-length figure,, with a view to an ultimate site in the Palace of Westminster: it appears that a considerable proportion of the available funds must be devoted to some object at Oxford.,The Commissioners have therefore examined two alternatives,namely, a bust to be placed within the Foreign Office buildings and secondly? a medallion outside the Foreign Office doorways opposite to the Downing Street stepss     They think it might be appropriate to place the memorial at this entrance door,, which is habitually used by Ministers of State as well as by the Corps Diplomatique when visiting the Department,,     The relief would be well within the range of personal vision by those most intimately acquainted with the late Lord Grey and his career at the Foreign Office.,     On the&apos;zwo
other hand the heavily rusticated &quot;background and the very restricted space would present difficulties which could hardly he overcome &quot;by the closest collaboration between the sculptor and the architect, so much so that the more conventional scheme of a portrait bust inside the Foreign Office itself would probably be preferable,,JsIn spite of what the Fine Art Commission have said in regard to the garden wall proposal I remain of the opinion that not only on aesthetic but on every ground this Bite is essentially unsuitable.       If it is held essential that the memorial should be out of doors I feel that the medallion outside the Foreign Office doorway, opposite the Downing Street steps, though admittedly not an ideal proposal and open to some objections, does not present-insuperable difficulties, .    But to my mind the proposal of- ja bust in the vacant niche on the first landing of the Foreign Office main staircase is the most appropriate memorial to Lord Greyo       Having re&amp;ard to the respect in which all of us hold the services and personality of Lord Grey and to the natural reluctance to disappoint in any way those whose aim it is to perpetuate his memory? I have felt that at this stage I must consult my colleagues and I would hope that they will authorise me to inform the Memorial Committee that the proposal of a site for the memorial in the Downing Street garden wall cannot be entertained, and that, of the two alternatives, the Cabinet regard the site within the Foreign Office as being the more appropriate.9th July,1955.BUM,,Office of Works.
