&amp; ribTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S (X) VEHEMENT. SEORETC.P.150 (35) COPY NO.      Cg-VCABINS T.COTTON MAMJFACTURING- INDUSTRY (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) ACT, 1954. Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.Under the above mentioned Act associations representing respectively (a) employers in the cotton manufacturing industry controlling the majority of looms in the industry and (b) the majority of the persons employed in the industry of the grades affected, can make joint application for an Order giving statutory effect to collectively agreed rates of wages.     The Act provides that before such an Order can be made the Minister must appoint a Board of three persons,   not connected with the industry, to consider the application after giving public notice and opportunity for objections, and no Order can be made unless the Board make a unanimous recommendation in that sensesThe passage of the Act stimulated the Cotton organisations concerned to make a great effort to arrest the process of under-cutting of wage rates which threatened to undermine the whole system of collective wage agreements in the industry, by negotiating a new and comprehensive agreement for weavers&apos; wages. The Cotton Spinners 1 and Manufacturers 1 Association and the Amalgamated Weavers&apos; Association having concluded such an agreement on 15th March, 1935, thereupon applied for an Order, and my predecessor, in accordance with the provisions referred to above, appointed a Board to consider the matter.     The members of the Board were:Dr. H.J.W. Hetherington -   Vice Chancellor of Liverpool University.Sir Arthur Pugh, C.B.E. -   General Secretary of the Iron and SteelTrades Confederation.Mr. J. Rogers -   Imperial Chemical Industries.After hearing objections at a public hearing in Manchester in the middle of last month, the Board have now unanimously recommended the making of an Order.     A copy of the board report is attached.In these circumstances I propose to make the attached Order, to come into effect as from the earliest practicable date6(Signed)    ERNEST BROWN.

244REPORT To the Right Hon. the Minister of LabourSib,We have the honour to submit the following report.PRELIMINARY.1. We were appointed on 23rd March, 1935, to be a Board to consider and report upon a joint application made by the Cotton. Spinners&apos; and Manufacturers&apos; Association and the Amalgamated Weavers&apos; Association, dated 19th March, 1935, for the making of an order under the provisions of the Cotton Manufacturing Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1934, with respect to an agreement between those organisations dated 15th March, 1935, as to the rates of wages to be paid to weavers employed in the Cotton Manufacturing Industry.2. Our task fell into two parts. We were required, in the first place, to inquire whether the organisations which are parties to the agreement are representative in the sense specified in the Act. If we were satisfied on this point, we were to proceed to inquire whether it is expedient that an order be made, and only if we were unanimous in this matter to recommend that an order be made.3. We have had the assistance during our inquiry of six assessors appointed by the employers&apos; organisation and six assessors appointed by the workers&apos; organisation. The Cotton Spinners&apos; and Manufacturers&apos; Association appointed Mr. T. Ashurst, Alder-man J. H. G-rey, J.P., Alderman B. Hamer, J.P., and Messrs. H. Hindley, R. Houghton and C. Eatcliffe. The Amalgamated Weavers&apos; Association appointed Messrs. A. Barker, J. Hindle, J.P., C. Speak, J.F., T. Sumner, J.P., J. W. Sunderland, J.P., and W. J. Tout, J.P.4. We have held two meetings with the assessors, and a public sitting for the hearing of evidence by objectors which occupied the greater part of five days.REPRESENTATIVE CHARACTER OF THE ORGANISATIONS.5. The Act contemplates that no order shall be made unless the Board is of opinion that the organisations which are parties to the agreement were at the date of the making of the application re-presentative respectively of the employers controlling the majority of the looms in the industry and the majority of the persons em-ployed in the industry of the grade which will, if an order is made, be affected by the rates of wages provided for by the agreement,T.T v.-r-;.-&apos; :-v;;.v--
viz., weavers. In determining whether the employers&apos; organisation was so representative, no account is to be taken of the looms in any factory in which during the immediately preceding period of twelve months no looms had been used.6. We have had before us the particulars in regard to the repre-sentative character of the organisations which the regulations re-quire the organisations to submit in connection with the applica-tion. We have examined officials of the respective organisations with regard to the method by which these particulars were corn-piled. The returns obtained by them from their constituent bodies or from their officials for the purpose of the compilation have been furnished for our inspection. All this information has been sub-jected to the test of such statistical material from independent sources as was available. We are of opinion, as the result of our inquiry and examination, that both organisations which are parties to the application are representative in the sense specified by the Act.INQUIRY INTO THE EXPEDIENCY OF MAKING ANORDER.7. In conducting the second part of our inquiry we had before us the eighteen objections which were lodged to the application or to the making of an order. Several of the objectors asked to be allowed to appear before the Board in support and amplification of their written objections. Acting in the discretion which the Act confers upon us we decided to offer the opportunity of giving oral evidence to all the objectors with the exception of two whom we regarded as not directly affected by the agreement. Fourteen objectors took advantage of the opportunity thus afforded. The sitting of the Board and Assessors to hear oral evidence was held in the Albert Hall, Manchester, on the 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th and 17th May, 1935, and was open to the press and the public. The public hearing was largely attended.8. Evidence for the objectors was given in some cases by the individual objectors in person. In other instances the case was presented by Counsel, who led evidence from witnesses. Cross-examination of the witnesses was undertaken on behalf of the parties to the agreement by Mr. John Taylor (Solicitor) who with Mr. Cedric Taylor was appointed for the purpose by the Cotton Spinners&apos; and Manufacturers&apos; Association; and by Mr. A. Naesmith, J.P., Alderman Luke Bates, J.P., and Mr. James Bell, J.P., who were appointed by the Amalgamated Weavers&apos; Association.9. It was submitted on behalf of a number of objectors that a statement should be made at the public inquiry on behalf of the parties to the agreement on which they could be cross-examined.
The parties to the agreement were willing that this course should be taken but we did not feel that we should be assisted by such a procedure and we decided to confine the public inquiry to the hear-ing of objections. We had statements from the two organisations describing the circumstances which led up to the making of the agreement and explaining the relationship of the agreement to the previous wage lists which the agreement substitutes. We have re-examined those statements in the light of the evidence submitted to us. For the rest, we considered that the case for the agreement would emerge, as in fact it did, in the course of the cross-examina-tion of the objectors.RECENT HISTORY AND PRESENT POSITION OF THETRADE.10. Before proceeding to review the objections, we may indicate the background of our inquiry by a brief recital of the recent history of the trade and a description of the circumstances, as we have understood them, from which the application and the agreement have emerged.11. It is notorious that since the war the Lancashire cotton industry has suffered a severe contraction in demand and in output and that this contraction has assumed alarming proportions in the last five or six years. This reduction in the scale of the industry has been fully reflected in the weaving section. The production of piece goods which according to the Census of Production returns was 7,088 million linear yards in 1907 and had risen to 8,050 million linear yards in 1912, had shrunk by 1924 to 5,590 million linear yards and by 1930 to 3,179 million yards, a fall of 60-5 per cent, since before the war. The trade estimates that since 1930 there has been a further fall in production of over 3 per cent. According to Worrall&apos;s Textile Directory the number of looms in Lancashire fell from 805,000 in. 1914 to 792,000 in 1924 , 704,000 in 1930 and 518,000 in 1935, a percentage decrease since before the war of 35J per cent.12. The falling-off in the markets for Lancashire products has been greater in the cheaper sorts and as a result the home market has become relatively more important. Measured by linear yard-age, exports of piece goods represented 89 per cent, of the total production in 1907, 86 per cent, in 1912, 83 per cent, in 1924 and 79\ per cent, in 1930. Measured by square yardage, exports represented 74J per cent, of production in 1924, 71J per cent in 1930 and, according to an estimate by the trade, 59 per cent, in 1934.13. The share of the home market in piece-goods held by British products was (on the basis of linear yardage) 92-3 per cent, in 1907, 92 per cent, in 1912, 96-7 per cent, in 1924 and 90-3 per cent, in 1930.
14. It is not difficult to understand that the deterioration in the economic condition of the industry should have had serious effects both upon the observance of agreed wage rates and upon the position of the employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations through whose power the rates had hitherto been very generally enforced. Faced with the alternative of accepting reductions in wages or the closing of their mills, the workers, at first in the outlying districts and then more generally, began to condone departures from the agreed lists. This in its turn reacted on the organisations and on both sides there was a falling away.15. The most serious consequences developed only after the. end of 1932 when the &quot; more-looms-to-a-weaver &quot; joint agreement was put into operation. Prior to 1928 the accepted custom in the trade was for weavers to attend to four plain Lancashire looms. But about that time, with a view to securing a reduction in cost of&apos;&apos;&apos; production a system was devised under which, by removing from the weavers the ancillary labour of oiling, sweeping and weft and cloth carrying, by the installation of larger cops to reduce the work of re-shuttling and by certain other changes in working, a weaver might attend a larger number of looms than the four which had hitherto been customary. The scheme was put into operation on a limited scale on a basis of eight-loom weaving. The practice was resisted by the workers&apos; organisation largely on the ground that it involved a serious displacement of operatives. A strike and a lock-out ensued and the experiment was abandoned. A little later a new scheme was evolved based on six-loom working. This was again resisted by the workers&apos; organisation and the employers&apos; association thereupon abrogated all existing! wage agreements. Settlement of this vexed question was eventually reached towards the end of 1932 and a joint agreement, known, as the &quot; more-looms-to-a-weaver &quot; agreement, was made in December of that year, which provided for six-loom working on a limited range of cloths, chiefly plain.16. Because the worker was to be paid for the product of six looms instead of four, the basic piece-price in this agreement for a given length of cloth was lower than the list price ruling for four-loom weaving. The agreement provided for certain ancillary work to be done by the weaver at the employees charge and for certain working conditions to be provided. When the &quot; more-looms &quot; agreement was put into operation the lower six-loom piece-rate began to be applied riot only in its legitimate sphere, but to cases where workers were given only four and not six looms to work, to cases where the conditions for six-loom working laid down in the agreement were not provided, and to cloths which were outside the scope of the agreement. In some cases firms did not even pay the six-loom rate for four-loom weaving but made a direct cut in the list prices. Once breaches in the agreed lists were made they spread rapidly.   A vicious circle of wage cutting and price cutting
was set up and the industry was faced with the possible collapse of the whole principle of collective bargaining. It was in these circumstances that the trade applied for an Enabling Bill and Parliament enacted the legislation under which our proceedings have been held.CHANGES INVOLVED BY THE AGREEMENT.17. To assist the full appreciation of the application into which we have had to inquire we must indicate the principal changes involved in the new agreement. This description is based on statements made and documents furnished to us by the parties to the agreement.18. The new agreement consists of two parts : (a) the Grey Cloth section and (b) the Coloured Cloth section. In each part provision is made for rates for (i) the six-loom system of working, (ii) the more than six-loom system of working, and (iii) all other cases. The principal lists which the new agreement supersedes and in certain respects supplements are three in number : (i) the old Uniform list, (ii) the Colne Coloured Goods list and (iii) the &quot; more-looms-to-a-weaver &quot; agreement of December, 1932.19. The old Uniform list and the Colne Coloured Goods list applied to weaving with four or fewer looms to a weaver. Rates for six-loom working, on the limited class of cloths on which six-loom weaving was recognised, were provided by the &quot; more-looms-to-a-weaver &quot; agreement.20. The old Uniform list covered the Grey Cloth section of the trade. The standard prices in the list had been subject since before the war to percentage additions which have been varied from time to time by agreement between the parties. Since September, 1932, the percentage addition had stood at 67. In the new agreement the percentage addition has been consolidated in the basis rates, not at the level of 67 per cent, but at the figure of 57J per cent., and the prices in this part of the agreement are net throughout. The standard rate has also been altered from a length basis to a pick basis. It represents a reduction of 5&apos;7 per cent, on the old Uniform list, viz., from 21-74d. per 100,000 picks to 20-5d. per 100,000 picks.21. The Colne Coloured Goods list (and the Radcliffe and District Coloured Goods list which operated in its place in certain areas) covered the Coloured Cloth section of the trade. The standard prices in the Colne Coloured Goods list were subject to percentage additions of 69J per cent, in the case of stripes and 64J per cent, in the case of checks. In this case the percentage additions have not been consolidated but under one of the pro-visions of the agreement they still apply to the basic prices. The standard prices in the Coloured Cloth section have not been altered in the new agreement, but numerous amendments have
been made in the clauses which determine the variations in the base rate for variations from the standard in respect of reeds, weft and so on. These changes do not lend themselves to ex-pression as a uniform percentage change on the old Colne Coloured Goods list.22. The &apos;&apos; more-looms-to-a-weaver &apos;&apos; agreement was applicable only to weavers on six looms who were provided with certain work-ing conditions and were working on a specified limited range of cloths. The standard rate was 175d. per 100,000 picks. The new agreement makes provision for six-loom working on all classes of grey and coloured cloths covered by the agreement. The standard rate is 18&apos;2d. per 100,000 picks, an increase of 4 per cent, in the Grey Cloth section. It is not possible to make a comparison between the standard rates under the &quot; more-looms-to-a-weaver &quot; agreement and the new agreement in the matter of Coloured Cloths, as the latter were not in general subject to the &quot; more-looms-to-a-weaver &quot; agreement. The differential between the four-loom and the six-loom standard rates is approximately the same in both the Grey Cloth and the Coloured Cloth sections, viz., 11J per cent, and 11 per cent, respectively.23. The new agreement recognises for the first time systems of working more than six-looms to a weaver. It provides rates for such systems of Is. per hour plus one-fifth of the earnings from all the looms the weaver is operating, calculating on the price for six-loom working.24. The significance of the above described changes involved in the new agreement may be gathered from the following particulars based on estimates furnished by the trade. About 15 per cent, of the total number of looms are working on the six-loom system, fewer than 1 per cent, on more than six looms, and the remaining 84 per cent, or over on four or fewer looms per weaver. Under 5 per cent, of the total number of looms are on rayon only, under 7 per cent, on mixtures of rayon and cotton, and the remaining 88 per cent, or over on cotton alone.25. The changes in wage-rates involved in the new agreement will be fully effective only in the case of workers who have been paid in accordance with the lists. Workers who have been paid below list rates will be subject, as the case may be, to lesser re-reductions or to greater advances.THE OBJECTIONS.26. The objectors comprise 22 individual firms, two trade unions which submit a petition against the agreement signed by 13,241 individual workers, and two employers&apos; associations. As far as can be  ascertained  the objectors  represent on  the employers&apos;   side
approximately 8 per cent, of the loomage in the trade and a smaller percentage of the loomage affected by the agreement; and on the workers&apos; side over 10 per cent, of the weavers affected.27. A number of the objectors raised points in common and the majority of the objections can be classified into broad groups. It is not our intention to review the objections individually but to deal with them in a general way according to the nature of the considerations which they raise. &apos; /(a) The exclusion of cebtain areas from the operationof the agreement.28. One group of objections is based on the circumstance that the Act does not include within its scope all the areas in which manufacture is carried on of a kind to which the agreement applies. The objectors submit that they will be prejudiced in competition with firms in the non-included areas, who, if an order is made, will be free of any legal compulsion in the matter of wage rates. It is suggested that the effect of an order may be to drive the in-dustry into the non-included areas.29. The area to which the Act applies is specified in the Statute and was determined by Parliament. An objection to the agree-ment on the ground that its operation will be limited is an objec-tion which would lie to any and every application made under the Act. If the results contemplated by the objection should be realised, the remedy lies with Parliament. We do not feel we should be moved by an objection of this character unless evidence had been submitted which convinced us that the legalisation of wage rates which was not comprehensive in its application would have results which would seriously injure the industry. No such evidence has been adduced and the majority of the trade do not appear to share the apprehensions of the objectors in this matter.30. At the same time we think that if the agreement is legalised^ the question of the area of its application might well be reviewed by the appropriate authority in the light of the objections which have been made.(b) Local Disadvantages Allowances.31. The agreement provides that the prices set out in the list are subject to the respective deductions for local disadvantages allowances in certain districts prescribed by the Award of the Industrial Court made under the provisions of the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, and dated the 28th April, 1920.32. We have examined the Award referred to and find that at the hearing of the case to which it relates a review was made of the position of a number of non-associated firms in country dis-tricts in North-Bast Lancashire and in Yorkshire, in the matter
of deductions which they were making&apos; from the list prices observed at the time by the associated firms in the area. [The Court after, reviewing each case individually decided to abolish the deductions in some cases, to reduce them in others and to maintain them in others. The grounds on which the deductions were held to be justified in the cases in which they were retained were that the mills concerned were under considerable relative disadvantage in respect of cost of production by reason of the heavy cartage charges to which they were subject in country districts and in respect of the heavier capital Charges in proportion to output under which they worked owing to the greater distance from the trading centre, Manchester, and the consequent delays in obtaining material and disposing of cloth.33. It has been submitted to us by a firm at Linton near Skipton and by four firms at Cowling in the Eural District of Skipton, none of whose cases is covered by the Industrial Court Award, that they suffer at present from disadvantages both of the kind described above and from others. It appears that they have been able to meet the position up to the present by reason of the absence of any legal obligation to pay to the agreed lists without deductions. If however an order is made they will be precluded from paying anything less than the agreement rates and they are of opinion, that they will be prejudiced in relation to other similarly situated places which enjoy an allowance under the Award and to places which enjoy no allowance but are more favourably situated than themselves.34. The claim was made that Dinton and Cowling should have reasonable disadvantages allowances from the new agreement and the Cowling objection asked that this should be larger or in any case not smaller than that for the neighbouring town of Skipton whose allowance under the Award is 5 per cent.35. We observe that the highest disadvantages allowance granted by the Industrial Court to any firm is 5 per cent. This is a de-duction from the old Uniform and Colne Coloured Goods lists which have been subject to percentage additions of 67 per cent, in one case and 69J per cent, and 64J percent, in the other case. A 5 per cent, allowance on the old Uniform and Colne Coloured Goods lists is equivalent to only about 3 per cent, on the rates in the new agreement, and this is the advantage which Skipton will enjoy if an order is made.36. It further transpired in the course of cross-examination that all the firms concerned in the objection are using rayon to a certain extent and three of the five to a very large extent and that in the case of rayon, the yarn is delivered carriage free at the factory. Moreover, part of the production of these firms is marketed in places to which the costs of transport are lower than to Manchester.
All these circumstances mitigate to some extent the situation in which the objecting firms will be placed. Hence although the objection retains some of its force the effect of an order might &quot;not be so serious as was represented to us.(c) Applicability of the Agreement to Rayon Weavings.37. It has been submitted by six firms (one of which is engaged in merchanting and not manufacturing) and by the Silk Assdcia-tion of Great Britain (which includes one of the individual firms objecting on this point but does not, we understand, otherwise represent any affected firm in the area which objects to the applica-tion) that the rates in the agreement are not suitable for artificial silk. It is pointed out that while in the early days of the use of this material the difficulties of weaving were such as to require wage rates higher than those paid for the weaving of cotton, that con-dition of things has largely changed. some of the firms state that as a result of improvements in the manufacture of rayon yarn and in its beaming and sizing, the difficulties of weaving rayon are but little greater, and some that they are no greater, than those attaching to cotton weaving. Hence it is argued that the additions to the cotton rates provided in the agreement where artificial silk warps or wefts are introduced and which total 40 per cent, for cloths composed wholly of artificial silk, are no longer justified. The high prices for rayon weaving are held responsible for retard-ing the development of the trade in this fabric and for its almost complete restriction to the protected home market.38. The claim that artificial silk weaving is little or.no more difficult than cotton weaving was strongly controverted in evidence before us by individual weavers who have personal experience of the work. These witnesses pointed to the slower rate at which the looms are run and to the more frequent stoppages involved. Both of these factors adversely affect earning power. The weavers maintained that the rates for artificial silk weaving were both relatively and absolutely too low and quoted examples of actual cases in which weavers&apos; earnings which are already none too high will be subject to a material reduction under the new agreement.39. The differential between the rates for cotton and artificial silk weaving has not been increased but on the contrary somewhat reduced in the new agreement. By a slight reduction in the percentage allowance for both warp and weft and by a modification in the method by which these percentages are applied, the addition to be made to the rates for cotton in the case of a cloth composed entirely of artificial silk is reduced from 50 per cent, to 40 per cent, equivalent to a reduction of 6f per cent, on wages. This reduc-tion in the allowance for artificial silk is superimposed on a general reduction in the rates as a whole for four-loom weavers and only in the case of six or more loom weavers is there any offset by a general increase in the base rates.
40. The cost per pound of artificial silk yarn is several times that of cotton yarn and wages are accordingly a much smaller, element in the total cost of producing an artificial silk cloth than&apos; is the case with a cotton cloth. Hence as regards artificial silk, a relatively large change in the wage rate would be necessary to effect a relatively small change in the total cost of production.41. For four-loom weaving the actual wage-rates for artificial silk weaving are in general reduced under the new agreement, and to that extent the position of the manufacturer of artificial silk fabrics has been eased. So far as foreign trade is concerned, the foreign trade returns show that in the last few years the imports of piece goods made either wholly or paz-tiaily of artificial silk have declined materially, while the exports of the two sorts taken together have slightly increased. We have formed the view, from other evidence that under the old lists the trade was making increasing use of artificial silk yarns, either warps or wefts or both, and that in many cases looms were being transferred from cotton to mixtures of cotton and artificial silk. In these circum-stances we see no reason for undue apprehension as to the effect of the agreement on the expansion of the artificial silk industry.(d) The rates in the Nelson and Colne Areas. 42. An important objection is that lodged by the Nelson and District Weavers&apos; Association and the Colne and District Weavers&apos; Association, which was accompanied by a petition against the legalisation of the new agreement signed by 13,241 weavers in these areas. The objection rested on the ground that the agree-ment involves severe reductions in a very large number of cases in wages which are already low enough. In support of the objec-tion a - statement was produced showing that the average gross weekly wage during the last available period of approximately six months of 43 weavers employed on all kinds of cloth was 39s. 5d. The objection gave particulars of certain specific sorts of cloth showing the rates payable under the present lists and under the new agreement respectively, which indicated large percentage reductions.43. It appears that Nelson is engaged mainly on grey cloths of the finer types and Colne mainly on coloured cloths. About 10 per cent, of the workers are stated to be employed on the more-looms system, and it was admitted that these workers gain an advance under the new agreement. The objection was pressed most strongly in regard to three and four-loom weavers on high class coloured goods and on artificial silk goods.44. While it was not seriously contested that the new agree-ment involves substantial reductions in the rates for many types of cloth, both cotton and artificial silk, woven on the four-loom system, it was represented on behalf of the parties to the agree-ment that the objections exaggerated the extent of the reductions
and undervalued the general level in the district of earnings from which the reductions would be made.45. It was brought out in cross-examination that the very large reductions on particular cloths which were quoted in the objection were not typical of those which would apply to the general run of work in the area. Moreover, we requested and obtained par-ticulars from a number of firms in the district showing the average weekly earnings of workers employed by them over recent periods ranging in the case of the different firms from 12 to 30 weeks. The figures indicate average weekly earnings over the whole of these establishments materially above the figure submitted by the objectors.(e) The objections that the agreement will retard progress.46. The objections which have been put to us with perhaps the greatest force and which derive importance from their larger significance for the trade as a whole are those comprised under three heads relating (i) to the desirability of permitting an alterna-tive method of wage payment, (ii) to the relationship between rates for four-loom weaving and those for six- or more-loom weaving and (iii) to the absence from the agreement of an allowance in respect of the provision by the employer of warp stop motions, weft feeler motions and similar mechanical aids to increased pro-duction. The points raised under these three heads proved to be inter-related and it is convenient to consider them together.47. The grounds of the claim for an alternative system of wage payment are that the fixed piece-prices which constitute the base rates in the agreement (a) fail to provide an equal wage for equal effort irrespective of the cloth woven or the number of looms attended, (5) do nothing to protect the weavers&apos; earnings during the probationary period of the working of a new fabric and (c) provide no compensation to the weaver for partial employment. The argument is that fixed piece-prices are inelastic and are not capable of being adjusted to developments in the industry and to the introduction of new methods of working, improved machinery, and new or improved materials; and that the workers under such a system secure a disproportionately large share of the results of improvements paid for by the employer. Hence it is suggested that the piece-price basis of wage rates which the agreement adopts does nothing to encourage, even if it does not positively discourage, initiative and progress ; and the possibilities of reducing costs of production and expanding the scope of the industry will be retarded.48. The desirable alternative method of wage payment which is adumbrated is a time-rate or &quot; fall-back &quot; rate combined with some form of bonus or premium on output to act as an incentive to the worker and to reward exceptional skill. The computation of the standard rate and of the rate of bonus is to be made in relation to what is called &quot; the occupational wage value per hour
of a skilled weaver.&quot; The earnings of a worker calculated in this way would be practically independent of the type of cloth or, the number of looms on which the worker is engaged and the skill of the individual worker would affect only the&apos; premium element in the wage payment.49. One of the objectors gave us in evidence an impressive account of the working of such a system in his own establishments and of its results. In this case practically the whole of the output is rayon. The largest group of workers are employed on eight looms each, the next largest group on six looms each, and only a small proportion of the total are employed on fewer than six looms. The firm work double shifts of about 40 hours a week. A statement was submitted to us showing over a range of the firm&apos;s typical products the earnings of the workers under the system of payment now in operation and the increases which would be involved by paying under the new agreement. The present payments are on a basis of Is. per hour, 9d. per hour and 6d. per hour for eight-loom, six-loom and four-loom weavers re-respecively, with a bonus on output.50. As regards method of wage payment, the Act provides that if an order is made an employer shall pay a worker at a rate not less than the rate applicable in his case under the order. There is nothing in the Act to prevent an employer, when an order is made, and subject to anything contained in the order as to the method of calculating wages, from computing and paying wages on any particular basis provided that the rate is not less than the rate applicable under the order. For example, the rate applicable under the agreement to a weaver employed on weaving standard grey cloth on the six-loom system is 18-2d. per 100,000 picks put in by the loom. Provided that the payment for each 100,000 picks worked out at not less than 18-2d. an employer would commit no infraction of the order merely by employing and paying his workers on some system of &quot; fall-back &quot; rate with a premium.51. While the calculations necessary to establish equivalence may not be simple, it should not be impossible to arrange that any alternative system of wage payment should be so based as to comply with the requirements of the agreement. If this is true, the substantial force of this objection is simply that the rates proposed by the new agreement are too high. Hence the question of the method of wage fixation appears to us to be secondary to that of the actual rates for the different systems of working and their relationship. It may be added that of the objectors who at the inquiry advocated an alternative system of wage payment, only two have such a system actually in operation at the present time. Others expressed a desire to be free to adopt it if they so chose.
52. The grounds of objection to the six-loom rate are (a) that the proposed increase in the present rate will arrest the develop-ment of the six-loom system of working which has contributed to a reduction in costs of production and an improvement in the com-petitive position of the industry; (b) that the agreement does not make adequate allowance for the provision by the employer of the auxiliary work of cleaning and oiling, carrying- of weft and cloth and the other incidental work which under the system is removed from the weaver; and (c) that the effect of the rates will be to widen the already large gap in earnings between three- or four-loom weavers and six-loom weavers, and create dissatisfaction among the workers. The objections to the rate for more than six-loom working are broadly of a similar character.53. The point to be noted about the last part of this objection is that in the new agreement the six-loom rate under the grey cloth section has been raised from 17-5d. to 18-2d. per 100,000 picks and the four-loom rate has been reduced from 21-74d. to 20-5d. per 100&apos;,000 picks. The margin between the four-loom rate and the six-loom rate has therefore been narrowed from one of about 20 per cent, to one of 11J per cent.54. The third objection that the agreement fails to make any allowance for the provision by the employer of warp stop motions, weft feeler motions and similar improvements which involve the employer in expense while entailing saving to the worker, is, in principle, a particular case of the wider objection set out above. It is argued that the omission is unjust and that it will act as a discouragement of progressive methods and a brake upon trade development.55. It was brought out in evidence that while the cost of warp stop motions is relatively high their nse is an advantage to the employer as well as to the worker. It also transpired that in the case of many firms the adoption of this device has not been accom-panied by a deduction from the workers&apos; wage rates.5:6. Complaints of the conditions which are required to be observed by the employer where workers are operating six or more looms each, and complaints of the inadequacy of the allowances for rewound weft and ring weft and of the absence of any provision for variations in quality of warp yarn, came largely from the same sources and were based mainly on the same grounds as the objec-tions to the more-looms i-ates.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS.57. Such is our analysis of the main points raised by the objec-tions. They resolve themselves into two main classes. There are those which arise from local conditions or conditions affecting-individuals or small groups of sectional interests. There are those on the other hand which are of general significance for the whole
trade. To the second class belongs the body of related objections which claim that the agreement will retard progress. In regard to both classes we have to consider whether any of the objections or all of them together have such force as to convince us that it is inexpedient that an order should, be made on the agreement.58. Paragraphs 11 to 16 of our report set out the circumstances in which the agreement has been made. It was negotiated under the stimulus of an Act of Parliament which held out to the parties a hope that a suitable agreement might be made enforceable throughout the trade. It may be presumed that in making the Act, Parliament had at least provisionally accepted the contention of the parties that the most urgent need of the industry was for a set of stable wage-rates adequately protected against the de-moralising undercutting and undermining which have been so prominent a feature of the industry in recent years. That need has been pressed upon us many times over in the course of our inquiry. Indeed with one or two exceptions the objectors them-selves have taken no exception to the principle of the legalisation of wage rates arrived at by the methods of collective bargaining.59&apos;. Our task, however, was to determine not whether the Nin-dustry would benefit by the legalisation of some agreement but whether it would benefit by the legalisation of this particular agreement. We feel that we are bound to approach even this narrower question with certain presumptions and presuppositions in mind. An agreement, in order to be legalised, has first to be made in this instance under difficult conditions and by the usual process of discussion and negotiation between organisations of employers and workers which on each side represent a majority of the persons affected. The parties do not claim, and for their present purpose have no need to claim, that the agreement solves every problem and preserves the ideally desirable balance between all the different interests concerned. They do claim that the present settlement is the best that could be made under present conditions. It is the outcome of long and hard negotiation, of keen bargaining on both sides: and on both sides the parties have willingly set their hands to it. Indeed many of the objectors who criticised the agreement, either in principle or in detail, were still willing to admit that in the circumstances no better agreement could be secured. Moreover and this is a fact to which we attach some importance it was a matter of common knowledge in the trade that the negotiations which preceded and led up to the agreement were taking place and the matter attracted wide publicity.60. We are prepared to believe that the legalisation of the agree-ment is likely to remove one of the gravest difficulties under which the industry has laboured in recent years, and by putting a bottom to the wage position, to free the trade once for all from the menace of uncontrollable undercutting.
61. Moreover, the agreement gives official recognition and sanction for the first time to the system under which six-loom working may be applied to the whole range of cloths : and also for the first time recognises systems of working more than six looms to a weaver. It indicates, therefore, some readiness on the part of both sides to examine hopefully the difficult questions which are raised by developments in industrial technique and organisation.62. These are considerations of great moment. On the other hand we are of opinion that, in varying measure, many of the objections have substance. We have to try to decide where the balance of advantage lies.63. We are disposed to think that we should not be justified in opposing the legalisation of the agreement because of the objec-tions which we have described as of limited local or occupational scope the more important of which are set out in paragraphs 28 to 45. We take this view not because we think that the objectors wholly failed to sustain their objections. In some cases at least, even if the force of the objection proved to be less than at first appeared, something of it remained. The main point, however, in this connection, is that any agreement represents the majority view-in a particular set of circumstances : and it is hardly conceivable that in a position of such complexity as that with which the Cotton Trade has been faced, every local circumstance can be fully met. But the agreement is not for all time. It is open to amend rnent at any moment by settlement between the parties. If, on some of the points which have been brought to our notice, a settlement is reached by the ordinarily constituted authorities of the industry, no great difficulty is likely to be experienced in legalising under the machinery of the Act any modifications which are desired.64. The feature of the agreement which has given us most con-cern is that dealt with in paragraphs 46 to 56, which set out the body of related objections directed to the method of wage payment, the relationship between the rates for the different systems of working, and the effects of the agreement on the development of the industry.65. On the question whether fixed piece-prices or a basis time-rate with a premium on output constitute the more desirable method of wage fixation there may well be more than one opinion. On the side of the method of a basis time-rate with or without an output premium are to be counted its adaptability to changing1 circumstances and methods, its power to secure to a worker a reasonable remuneration independent of factors over which the worker has no control, and the incentive it creates for the employer to improve his methods of production and by increasing the output of his looms to secure a reduction in costs without at the same time bringing about a reduction in the worker&apos;s earnings.   The
principle has in fact been recognised to a limited extent in the new agreement in the form which the rate for more than six-loom weaving now takes. On the other hand, the trade has an age-long tradition of fixed piece-prices. If it is held that fixed piece-prices give the worker a more than proportionate share of the results of improved methods and machinery, it may on the other hand be argued that a fixed basis time-rate deprives the worker of practically any share in such results.66. For our present purpose, however, this question is significant only as a particular case of the general difficulty of introducing changes in the organisation and technique of the industry de-signed to increase&apos; the productivity of the weaver. The de-velopment of the more-than-four-looms system is precisely such another case, and of greater immediate importance. And it is easy to understand why, especially from the side of the operatives this particular change has met with formidable opposition. The ground is simply that the first result would be a diminution in the demand for labour and in the aggregate volume of employment in the trade. In the workers&apos; view, any compensating increase of employment which might follow in the future upon a reduction in cost of production and a consequent stimulation of demand are problematical, while the reduction in the demand for weavers which results from the substitution of a more-looms for a four-loom system is certain and immediate.67. The point in the new agreement which is most material to this issue is the relation between the rates for four and for more than four-loom weaving. Paragraph 53 shows that the difference between the four and the six-loom rates has been reduced from 20 per cent, to&apos; 11J per cent. It was submitted by a number of the objectors that thereby the inducement to an employer to work more looms systems has been, if not entirely removed, reduced to small proportions. We do not think that that contention has been or can be seriously called in question. The employers&apos; association in a memorandum supplied to the Board stale : &quot; The primary object of the new list was to meet the difficulty arising from the alleged disparity between the four-loom and six-loom prices. By increas-ing the more-looms price and reducing the four-loom, the former is now only 11J per cent, below the latter. For this 11J per cent, the more looms manufacturers must provide the conditions required. It is generally agreed by the employers that the new bases have equated the prices on the various systems and will put a firm, irrespective of what system it is on, in a reasonably competitive position as compared with other firms on other sj^stems.&quot;68. Alongside this statement must be set another from the same document that the original purpose of the more-looms system of working was &quot; to reduce costs of production without reducing wages or lengthening hours of work.&quot; We cannot fail to observe that as between the original purpose here described, and the present
principle has in fact been recognised to a limited extent in the new agreement in the form which the rate for more than six-loom weaving now takes. On the other hand, the trade has an age-long tradition of fixed piece-prices. If it is held that fixed piece-prices give the worker a more than proportionate share of the results of improved methods and machinery, it may on the other hand be argued that a fixed basis time-rate deprives the worker of practically any share in such results.66. For our present purpose, however, this question is significant only as a particular case of the general difficulty of introducing changes in the organisation and technique of the industry de-signed to increase the productivity of the weaver. The de-velopment of the more-than-four-looms system is precisely such another case, and of greater immediate importance. And it is easy to understand why, especially from the side of the operatives this particular change has met with formidable opposition. The ground is simply that the first result would be a diminution in the demand for labour and in the aggregate volume of employment in the trade. In the workers&apos; view, any compensating increase of employment which might follow in the future upon a reduction in cost of production and a. consequent stimulation of demand are problematical, while the reduction in the demand for weavers which results from the substitution of a more-looms for a four-loom system is certain and immediate.67. The point in the new agreement which is most material to this issue is the relation between the rates for four and for more than four-loom weaving. Paragraph 53 shows that the difference between the four and the six-loom rates has been reduced from 20 per cent, to 11J per cent. It was submitted by a number of the objectors that thereby the inducement to an employer to work more looms systems has been, if not entirely removed, reduced to small proportions. We do not think that that contention has been or can be seriously called in question. The employers&apos; association in a memorandum supplied to the Board stale : &quot; The primary object of the new list was to meet the difficulty arising from the alleged disparity between the four-loom and six-loom prices. By increas-ing the more-looms price and reducing the four-loom, the former is now only 11J per cent, below the latter. For this 11J per cent, the more looms manufacturers must provide the conditions required. It is generally agreed by the employers that the new bases have equated the prices on the various sj^stems and will put a firm, irrespective of what system it is on, in a reasonably competitive position as compared with other firms on other systems.&quot;68. Alongside this statement must be set another from the same document that the original purpose of the more-looms system of working was &quot; to reduce costs of production without reducing wages or lengthening hours of work.&quot; We cannot fail to observe that as between the original purpose her-e described, and the present
purpose explained in the preceding paragraph, a certain change of emphasis is apparent. And we think it probable that there are good grounds for raising the question whether the new agreement does not contain elements which might tend to discourage the extended employment of more-looms systems.69. We recognise, of course, the extreme difficulty of the situa-tion with which those responsible for the policy of the industry are confronted- On the one side, if any progress is to be made towards improving its competitive position in the world market upon which (see para. 12) it is still mainly dependent, or even towards arrest-ing the present downward tendency, an essential factor is the reduction of costs of production. Short of wholesale and disastrous reductions in wages, that can be accomplished only by using technical improvements to the full. It would therefore be un-fortunate if any avoidable obstacle were placed in the way of developments in this direction. On the other hand, it has to be remembered that the plain Lancashire loom worked on the four-loom system is still the principal tool of the industry. In the interests of the weavers, and on other grounds also, we wholly agree that it has been and is well worth while, by every possible means, to seek to control the rate of change in technique and organisation, and to try to secure that changes are made in a fashion which causes the minimum of disturbance and hardship.70. The true objective of policy, therefore, is plain enough, though it is hard at any given moment to decide by what steps it is to be approached. There may be grounds for thinking that the proposed new agreement rests somewhat too completely upon the present stage of the development of the industry. But it would be wrong to ignore the elements of advance which it contains; or to belittle the promise which it holds of the concerted exploration of the problems which it recognises and which still remain.71. Having most carefully weighed all the various considerations, we are clear as to the conclusion to which we are led. The agree-ment may have defects. But we have no reason to doubt that it is a notable improvement on what has gone before, and upon the present chaotic situation in the industry. We believe that it may prepare the way for an even better agreement, and for better days. We are satisfied that the promoters of this agreement have rightly diagnosed as the first and fundamental necessity of the industry a secure and universally enforceable wages basis on which it can stand and from which it can move forward. No objection which may lie against the present agreement, nor all the objec-tions together, seem to us to be of sufficient force to justify our recommending that the attainment of that basis should be post-poned ; and nothing which we have heard during the enquiry leads us to believe that the operation of the rates provided in the agree-ment will prove gravely detrimental either to those who have objected or to others.
RECOMMENDATION.72. In all the circumstances we consider it is expedient that an order be made on the agreement, and we make a unanimous re-commendation that an order be made bringing into force, as respects all persons employed in the industry of the class or description to which the agreement relates the rates of wages provided for by the agreement.We have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servants,H.
