THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1935.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 117 (35).CABINET.3D    &apos; -CEYLON.Purchase of Tear Gas Apparatus by Government.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.MY colleagues will remember that in February, 1935, I circulated- a memorandum-C.P. 36 (35) regarding a proposal by the High Commissioner for&apos; Palestine that permission should be given for the use of tear gas against dangerous criminals entrenched in a house or other point of vantage, with a view to the reduction of casualties amongst police officers engaged in effecting their arrest. The Cabinet agreed on the 20th February that permission could be given (Cabinet Conclusions 10 (35), paragraph 7.)2., As my colleagues will have seen from the Colonial Office telegrams, circulated,to the Cabinet, I have, with the approval of the Prime Minister, recently authorised in Northern Rhodesia the use of tear gas rather than rifle fire if the responsible officer in charge is satisfied that a situation has arisen in which it would otherwise be necessary to shoot.3. I now append, for the information of my colleagues, a despatch from the Governor of Ceylon, in which he makes a proposal the exact parallel of that recently approved in the case of Palestine. As will be seen from Sir Edward Stubbs&apos;s despatch, the Ceylon proposal is based on experience in the Punjab,, viz., permission to be given for &quot;the importation of a supply of tear gas, and if necessary for use, but its use to be strictly limited to occasions when the authorities seek to arrest an armed individual who having sought refuge in a building or other place of vantage might evade arrest with the aid of firearms.4. The Police Force of Ceylon is a highly disciplined and efficient body, under the command at present of probably the best police officer in the Colonial Service, and I consider that the permission asked for can reasonably be given.(Initialled) P. C.-L.Colonial Office, Downing Street, June 3, 1935.[11675]
APPENDIX.Despatch from the Governor of Ceylon to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.No. 294, of May 4, 1935.Sir, Ceylon, May 4, 1935.I HAVE the honour to inform you that the Inspector-General of Police has proposed that the Ceylon Police be provided with the necessary equipment for employing the lachrymatory vapour known as &quot; Tear Gas,&quot; for the&apos; purpose of facilitating the capture of criminals who use firearms against the Police and the public in order to evade arrest. He has made enquiries from the Punjab Police and learnt that the Punjab Government has, with the sanction of the Secretary of State for India, approved the use of &quot; Tear Gas &quot; for arresting armed offenders.2. The use of this vapour would, I understand, only result in a temporary irritation of the eyes, and would cause no permanent harm. It would, therefore, appear to provide the most humane method of dealing with the armed criminal, as it obviates the necessity of using rifle fire, which endangers not only the criminal but also innocent persons who may be in the vicinity of a place where an armed criminal has sought refuge. It is not proposed to employ the vapour for dealing with disorderly crowds or for similar purposes; its use would be strictly limited to the arrest of an armed individual who, having sought refuge in a building or other place of vantage, might defy arrest with the aid of firearms.3. The Executive Committee of Home Affairs has considered the proposal and has decided that your sanction should be sought, in the first instance, for the import and use of the apparatus for experimental purposes, subject to the provision of the necessary funds by the State Council. Though the number of occasions has fortunately been few, the Ceylon Police have been called upon, in the past, to deal with armed criminals and armed lunatics, and it is very desirable that modern scientific methods, adopted in other countries on such occasions, should be made available in Ceylon. I would, accordingly, enquire whether you are prepared to sanction the purchase of a set of the apparatus consisting of one projector, six long-range projectiles and six. short-range projectiles in order to test its suitability for the purpose indicated. O&quot;,,,I have, &amp;c.R. E. STUBBS, Governor.
