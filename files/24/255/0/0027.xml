this DOCITI/iEN-T IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC rJAJESTY&apos;S SO VBRNt ENT.3Jlc.HET. Copy No.___1CP. 112(35) CABINET.Crediting of Unemployment Insuz^anqe Contributions toJuveniles in respeot of Voluntary Continued Education. Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of labour I am face a with a difficulty in connection with the Unemployment insurance of juveniles which may have unfortunate consequences and could I think be removed by a short non-contentious Bill.When proposals for lowering the insurance age to the school-leaving age were under discussion it was the general view, and one held particularly strongly by the Local Education Authorities (who for a long time regarded these proposals with a good deal of suspicion and dislike) that there should be a &quot;credit&quot; of contributions for attendance at school beyond the school leaving age of 14- years.   This was conceded in the Act of 1934 which lowered the insurance age and provided for a credit of ten contributions for one year&apos;s attendance and twenty contributions for two years&apos; attendance.   The minimum qualification for benefit is thirty contributions and the balance of twenty or ten contributions must of course be obtained by actual insurable work.    I should mention also that benefit cannot fee drawn before the age of 16.My difficulty arises as to the date from which these provisions are to be operative.   The children concerned are expected in general to remain at school to the end of the school year in June or July.and it has throughout been the intention that the credit should be given to those who leave school in the summer of the present year.   When the Bill was before the House there vra.s a demand that the credit should be given also to those who would leave school in the summer of 1954, the year in which the Act was passed.    This was resisted but in the Debate it was pointed out that (as it was then thought) the Bill would give the credit to those who were leaving school in 1935 and a definite pledge to this effect was given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry on 29th January, 1934.    (Hansard   Cols. 95 and 96).Unfortunately owing to the delay in passing the Act it did not give effect, as we now find, to this intention.   Without going into, details of drafting it.will be enough to say that the provisions as to crediting contributions cannot apply to any children who left school earlier than
one year after the date when the insurance age was lowered, i,e. earlier than 3rd September&quot;, 1935. This of course cuts out all those who.will leave school in the summer of this year.As I have said, benefit is not payable before the age of 16 and moreover, in order to qualify for benefit boys and girls must pay actual contributions (ten or more) sufficient to bring their total credit of contributions up to thirty.   But some of them will have r reached 16 before leaving school this summer, others will be approaching that age, and it is certain that unless the law is altered tho pledge will have been broken by the early autumn in some cases and in an increasing number of cases in succeeding months*We cannot hope that this point will escape attention.   As I have explained the matter is very present to the minds of Local Education Authorities, who would be certain to protest strongly against any failure to give the appropriate credits to boys and girls leaving school this summer.The necessary amending Bill which would involve no charge an. the Exchequer would be a short one and could be tightly drawn.   Provided that the Opposition agree to treat it as non-contentious, I am strongly of opinion that it ought to be introduced and passed as soon as possible, and I ask far authority to proceed accordingly.(Intld.)     O.S.51st May, 1935.H.Q.1110-65 E.E
