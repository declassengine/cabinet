CONFIDENTIAL.A.C.  521,BOARD OF TRADE AD VIS ORY C 0 UNO 11*17State of Trade, March, 1955.Summary of reports submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented -in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS TRADE.      Imports in March at  60.5 m. were  1.4 m.  less than in March,  1934.      Imports of food, drinic and tobacco showed little change but imports of articles wholly or mainly manufactured increased by  0.4 m. Imports of raw materials decreased by  1.7 m.      Exports of United Kingdom produce and manufactures were  36.0 m.  or  2.9 m. more than in March.a year ago.    The &apos;rise was largely due to increased exports of manufactured goods. Re-exports were  4.5 m. as compared with  5.6 m. a year ago.EMPLOYMENT.      Employment in March showed a further improvement which extended to nearly all the principal industries.      The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges at 25th March was 2,153,870,  which is 131,595 less than a month earlier. The main variations were:-The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-64 in employment at 25th March, was 10,200,000.      This was 119,000 more than a month earlier and 139,000 more than a year ago.Improvement was most marked during the month in the building industry,  but was also substantial in public wovks contracting,  coal mining,  engineering,  iron and steel manufacture,  clothing,  cotton spinning,  pottery and motor vehicles and in the transport and distributive trades.LondonSouth Eastern South Western Midlands  ....North Eastern North Western Scotland .... Wales- 21,037- 14,026- 12,702- 17,451- 21,973- 21,127- 15,813- 7,464
A further improvement was recorded in April, the number of unemployed falling by 10 9,000 as compared with March.FAIUfAY TRAFFIC.    During the five weeks ended 31st March railway traffic receipts fell by  591,000 (4.19$) as compared with the corresponding period of 1934.      There were decreases of 9.45% and 2.93$ respectively in passenger traffic and in coal,  coke and patent fuel, while there was an increase of 0.88$ in other freight traffic.      The comparisons are affected by the incidence of the Easter holidays in 1934, when Good Friday fell on March 30th.      The total receipts for the 13 weeks ended 31st March amounted to  34,465,000 as against  35,193,000 for the same period in 1934,  a decrease of  728,000,   or 2.07$.SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING.    The index number of shipping-freights for March (1913 ^ 100) was 75.60.      This is a slight improvement on February (73,59) but is less favourable than in March last year (78.03).      The amount of tonnage laid up at ports in Great Britain and Ireland at 1st April is provisionally estimated at 707,000 net tons as against 878,000 net tons on January 1st and 1,100,000 net tons on 1st April,  1934.The amount of tonnage under construction in Great Britain and Ireland on 31st March was 556,000 gross tons as against 597,000 gross tons on the 31st December and 481,000 gross tons a year ago.PJ^SESMi:&apos;      ^ne Clearing Banks&apos; buying rates for Bills, arranged in February, became effective during March and a fair supply of bills was ultimately forthcoming at -g$ for one and two months&apos; maturities and 9/l6ths for three months.    The average rate for Treasury bills improved to 10/4d. per cent, at the last tender for the month.      The foreign exchanges were disturbed.      About the middle of the month there was a
sharp fall in the Belga rate and. it was thought that Belgium would he forced off Gold.      Eventually the Belgian Government decided to adhere to the gold standard lout to devalue the currency &quot;by 28$.      Thereafter the exchange rate moved to its new parity of about 28-1- as against 20% at the beginning of the month.      The price of gold continued to show a premium over both the franc and the dollar.      Silver appreciated further during the month reaching 28 gd.  per ounce  on the 26th.GOAL.    The average weekly output for the quarter ended 23rd. March was 4.52 m. tons as compared with 4.63 m. tons in the corresponding quarter of 1934,  a decrease of 2.4$. The average number of persons employed during this period was 771,000 as compared with 786,000 a year ago.Exports in,March,  1935,  amounted to 3.2 m.  tons as against 2.9 m.  tons in March last year, while for the first quarter of 1935 exports were 9.4 it.  tons as against 9.3 m.  tons in the same period of 1934.      Exports in March to the Irish Free State, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Egypt and the Argentine all showed increases over last year,  but there was a decrease in exports to Belgium, France, Spain and 11 aly.IRON Aro^S^EE^.    Markets were waiting the results of the application to the Import Duties Advisory Committee for increased duties and conditions were somewhat quiet although the underlying tone was steady.      The increased duties ultimately granted were received with satisfaction,  but trier has as yet been little time to judge the effect.      Large tonnages of Continental material under contract prior to the raising of the duties will take some time to absorb.      The devaluation of the Belga has not so far affected Belgian steel export prices.      The plate trade generally has been quiet but section and joist mills are fairly well employed.
Railway supplies are in good, demand and general constructional orders are satisfactory.In Scotland the high rate of production is expected to continue and good business is forthcoming from locomotive and wagon manufacturers and from engineering firms.      Boiler makers and constructional engineers are also busy, but the sheet industry is working below capacity.On the ITorth East.....0qast the output of pig iron has been wellabsorbed.      Until re-rollers have absorbed the quantities of Continental billets and sheet bars bought in anticipation of the duties,  their full benefit will not be felt by the steel works.      The home demand for rails is fairly good and should continue for some time.      In Sheffield a further expansion in demand is expected.    Business in basic open hearth steel has revived and the demand for stainless and high speed steels continues active.      Re-rollers have also found increased business.      In the S^ul^hJ^ales area works producing heavy sections are fairly busy.-     The demand from constructional engineers has,   however,  fallen off though the ship repairing yards have taken fair quantities of steel. Tinplate manufacturers were working during March at about 50fo capacity.ENGlNI;.i&apos;iRING;.    The improvement noted in 1934 continued throughout the March quarter.      In particular there was an increase in home orders for the replacement of plant and machinery.      Overseas orders were secured in moderate volume. Shipbuilding orders were not numerous.      In the home trade the demand for textile machinery was disappointing but some good orders were obtained for spinning machinery for export. The development works undertaken by the railways have led to an increase in employment in outside, shops though th^s occurs irregularly.      The employment, position among members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union has snown some improvement in recent months.
MOTOR INDUSTRY.      Motor vehicles newly registered in February amounted to 24,956,  an increase of 3,588(16.8$) over a year ago.      The increase comprises..- . &apos;   .&apos;      ^    &apos;/. .     /. .3,557 private cars and 31 other vehicles.In the homo market the private car section continues to be well employed.      New registrations during the first five months of the 1934/35 season October to February showed an increase of 25$ over the corresponding period last  season.      During this period 4,138 cars were imported into the United Kingdom as against 1,452 cars in October to February of 1933/34.      There was a small decline in the number of new registrations of goods vehicles in February but this decrease was wholly in the classes over 2-g- tons unladen weight.      Registrations of the lighter type increased.In overseas markets the industry are not satisfied with the amount of the reduction in the Australian tariff on metal panels for motor car bodies and are pressing for free entry of complete motor car bodies and parts thereof.      The Canadian Budget Resolutions accord free... ...entry or reductions of duty to British trolley-bus, fire engine and railcar chassis and the position in regard to the import of diesel engines for trucks has also been eased.LIGHT METAL INDUSTRIES.      Most non-ferrous mills are busy and demand from industry continues to be good. The copper and tin markets have been unsettled.    Zinc and lead show little change.Business in the cutlery trade though better than a year ago is somewhat patchy.    All branches of the tool trades are well employed and both home and export trade show an improvement over last year.    The fishing tacKle
trade is also well employed, but there is a certain amount of short time in the needle industry where competition from Japan is reported.    Trade in enamelled hollow-ware is steady and in press work satisfactory, while the lock anu allied trades are better employed than a year ago. There is little change in the foundry industry, metal smallwares and metallic bedsteads.     Architectural metal-work shows some signs of revival.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.      During March 1,507 rn. units of electricity were produced as compared with 1,391 m. units in March last year.      The index of orders received for heavy plant was 113 in March as compared with 117 in February and 58 in March,   1934.      Imports of light apparatus were  212,000 in March as compared with  218,000 a year ago, while exports were  730,000 in March as against  617,000 in March,  1934.COTTON.     During the month there was some recovery in production and employment, although the levels of January were not reached.    Average weeKly deliveries of raw cotton to spinners were 26.15 m. lbs, as against 25.57 m. lbs. in February and 24.34 m.  lbs,   in March,  1934,,    There was a large increase in takings of Indian cotton.    There was a substantial fall in cotton prices during the month and spinners tried to take advantage of the fall to increase their margins, but met with only limited success.    Substantial orders for cotton yarns were, however, booked.Total exports of cotton yarns and piece-goods during March were  5.36 m. as against  5.18 m.  in February and  5.02 m. in March last year.      March exports of cotton piece-goods at 183.2 m.  sq.  yards were higher than in the . previous month and in March of last year. Shipments both to India and
British markets in Africa were higher than in February and trade with British West Africa,  in particular,  continued at a higher level than a year ago.      Shipments to Hong Kong, however,  fell considerably in March.      Among European markets exports to Scandinavia, Germany,  Switzerland and Turkey declined as compared with February,  but those to Eoumania showed some recovery.      There was an increase in shipments to Egypt and a substantial expansion in the case of Morocco and French West and Equatorial Africa,   although trade with the latter market was still below the level of March last year.      In South America trade with Venezuela, Columbia and Chile expanded but shipments to the Argentine were below those both of February 1935 and of March, 1934.SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.      There has been a falling off in the demand.for rayon yarns in the weaving trade but it is thought that the outlook will improve within the next two months.     The demand from the knitwear trade is satisfactory and shows some improvement from the stocking trade.      There is some slackening in the demand for rayon piece goods but this,  it is thought,  is only of a temporary nature.      Competition in the home market is abnormally keen on account of the shortage of foreign orders and to many manufacturers    prices show very little margin of profit. Exports of singles yarns for the first quarter of 1935 amounted to 2.52 m.  lbs.  as against 1.60 m.  lbs.  in the same quarter of 1934.Trade in real silk piece goods  continues to be affected in many lines by Japanese competition.      The better qualities of silk cloths,  however,  which were formerly manufactured on the Continent,  are now being produced to a far greater extent in this country.
CHEMICALSo    Deliveries of alkalies and of chlorine products and acids were satisfactorily maintained;, as were the home and export sales of dyestuffs,    The Spring demand for fertilisers in the home market is now at its height,,    Trade in wood distillation products was fairly regular with the exception of wood tar and wood creosote.    The market in tar products was not so bright generally, while trade in pharmaceutical products was definitely on the limited side.SOAP, OILS AND KINDRED INDUSTRIES.    In the soap trade the usual Spring recovery set in and the month closed on a satisfac-tory basis.    The demand for margarine showed a slow but steady improvement, and there was also an increased demand for edible oils and fats as compared with a year ago.    The better position in raw material production has also been well maintained.,POTTERY.      There has been a lull in activity in the first quarter of 1935 as compared with the same period of 1934. Present indications point to more business.    Exports of pottery for the first quarter of 1935 amounted to  806,000 as against  681,000 in the corresponding quarter of 1934.PAPER.    Conditions throughout the paper trade showed a definite improvement in March owing to an increased demand in the home market for practically all grades of paper, partly, owing to the forthcoming Jubilee celebrations.    The devaluation of the Belga has not so far led   to any price cutting, but there is some uneasiness lest devaluation should take place in Holland also.RETAIL TRADE.      The money value of retail sales in February was 4*9$ greater than in February, 1934.    The principal increases were in men&apos;s and boys&apos; wear (11.5$), boots and shoes (9*3$) and sports and travel goods (8.0$).    There was a decrease of 5.9$ in piece goods.    Every area showed an increase in sales of merchandise other than food and every area except London West-End in food.    Sales in March were 1$ greater than
in March 1934. The comparison is, However, affected by the incidence of pre-Easter sales which last year were wholly in March. 2f 5CO-OPERATIVE TRaDE.      The Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s sales for the four weeks  to 9th March showed an increase of 2.6% as compared with the corresponding period last year.      The weighted average of the wholesale prices of seven of the principal commodities showed an increase of 1.52% as compared with a year ago and the weighted average of the retail prices of the same commodities has increased by in Scotland trade during March has been variable.      In the Grocery Departments of the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society sales increased oy 7-g/o and in the burnishing Department by 10%,      The Boots and Drapery Departments however, showed, decreases of about bfo.CANADIAN  TRADE.      Business operations continued active in February,   the index moving up from&apos;97.5 in January to 100.6. The index of wholesale prices moved from 71.5 to 72.0.    There were increases in nickel and copper exports and in silver shipments, but gold shipments were less than normal for the season.      In the food industries  there was greater activity in the slaughtering and meat-packing Indus try -.      There was some decline in newsprint production, but exports of wood pulp and planks and boards showed an improvement.      The primary iron and steel industry was not quite  so active, but there was a considerable increa e in the production of motor vehicles.ADSTRaLITRaDE.      The number pi- bales of wool received into store between 1st July and the end of Feoruary was 2.54 m. as against 2.40m. a year ago.      Of these 1.75m. have been disposed of as against 2.16 m. a year earlier.      Wheat and flour shipments since December 1st are equivalent to 37.6 m. bushels of wheat against 32.6 m. bushels in the same period last-year.      Exports of butter (1st July to 23rd March) amounted to 97,500 tons as against 85,000 tons in the same period last year
The total imports of merchandise in February wore  6.7 m. (Australian currency) as against  6,07 m. a year ago.SEW ZEALAND TRADER     Exports in the first two months of 1935 amounted to  9.53 m.  as against  11.33 m.  in 1934. Imports in the same period of.1935 were  5.66 m, as against  4,80 m.  in 1934.      Employment at the end. of 1934 showed a definite improvement over the position a year earlier.      The dry summer has been unfavourable to dairy production. Gradings of butter and cheese in New Zealand in January and february, 1935, show decreases of 4,434 tons and 3,848 tons respectively as compared with the same period a year earlier. The consumption of New Zealand mutton in the United Kingdom has been satisfactory and is increasing, but prices are not expected to improve.      The frozen beef market has been quiet but relatively steady due to reasonable stocks.      Good clearances  of wool are being effected from New Zealand selling centre s.&apos; SOUTH AMERICA TRADE.There have been no major political changes in South America during the past three months and economic conditions have on the whole improved.ARGENTINA..      The official trade figures for 1934 snow an increase in the value of exports by 28,3,,%&apos; and of imports by 2&apos;5,7fc as compared with the year 1933*      These figures indicate a real improvement even after allowing for the inflation of the year 19 34 figures to the extent of about 20;? due to. the depreciation of the peso.      Imports in January, 1935,  show an increase of 18,2$ over those of January,  1934, and suggest that increased imports are likely to absorb a larger part of the improved trade balance.      Exchange for British imports should now be obtainable without difficulty provided the formalities are complied with.      Exchange for the financial service of British companies has become slightly easier.
BRAZIL.      Both, imports and. exports showed an improvement in 1934 over 1933.      Coffee exports declined somewhat but there was a considerable increase in exports of cotton.      Exchange required to pay for goods Imported after 11th February is now free from restrictions, and an agreement, has recently been concluded between the United Kingdom and Brazilian Governments covering transfers for financial services and payments for goods imported before that date. The acceptance of the Metropolitan-Vickers&apos; tender to electrify the Brazil Central Railway for  3 m. has been recommended.URUGUAY&apos;.      Trade in 1934 showed a slight improvement over 1933.      It is stated that the Autonomous Exchange Committee recently appointed Intends to direct trade towards  those countries which purchase most Uruguayan produce.OnlLE.      The balance of trade has improved but a large part of it is absorbed by compensation agreements with various countries and does not benefit holders of Chilean securities. The devaluation of the Chilean peso and its effects on customs payments have resulted in British goods losing a preference which they formerly enjoyed in respect of additional import duties,
