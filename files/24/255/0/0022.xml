(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY 1S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO.SECRET.CP. 107 ( 55) .CABINET. INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation, by the Government of India,  dated 15th May, 1935.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State lor India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India,  dated the 15th May,  1935, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.1.      That the people of India are imbued with deep feeling of loyalty to the British Crown has been strikingly shown by the Silver Jubilee celebrations held during the last week.1   In January last the Congress Working Committee passed a resolution that Congress workers should take no part in the celebrations on the ground that &quot;the rule with which His Majesty is identified is a positive hindrsnce to the political, morel and material growth of the Nation&quot; j some fanatical Muslims also advocated a boycott as a protest against the Government1s refusal to hold a public enquiry into the Karachi incident.   But,  in spite of these attempts,  and in spite of the agitation of recent years and the demand that India should become independent of the. British Empire,  the celebrations were conducted with magnificent enthusiasm in every part of India and formed a, striking testimony to the esteem and affection in which tho King Emperor and the Throne are held by all classes.2.      In political circles tho meetings of the All-India Congress Committee at Jubbulpore have attracted attention, but the Local Government reports that the most significant feature of the Conference was tho little interest the local public showed in the Committee or its doings.    The. Conference tended to show that there are still marked divisions in the Congress ranksj  the Socialist left-wing asserted itself, though it is not yet sufficiently strong to carry its views, and opinions were sharply divided on the question whether Congressmen should accept office if successful at elections. Mr. Gandhi is said to be in favour of accepting office  andobstructing/
obstructing the Government from within, but some of the Congress leaders would prefer to postpone  a decision till Jawahar Lai Nehru is free,  at about the end of the year, when the strength of the Congress Socialist Party can be gauged. To decide to accept office and to find the left-wing in opposition would accentuate the cleavage end Mr. Bhulabhai Desai,  loader of the Congress Party in the Assembly, realising this danger,  considers it may be necessary to review end reorientate Congress policy.Views on this question were no doubt largely influenced by the experience of the last Assembly Session.    Though the Nationalist papers have applauded the success of the Congress Party in the Assembly,  as shown by the numerous defeats inflicted on the Government, yet the Socialist Party have pointed out that nothing substantial has been obtained, while in other quarters it has been suggested that opposition would have been wiser and would have creeled a more difficult position for the Government if,  instead of making wholesale cuts in demands for grants end mutilating taxation proposals, they had concentrated on those points on. Avhich they would have received support from other sections of the House.    To meet this attitude of obstruction the Government were forced to rely on the safeguards in the existing constitution.    And the safeguards proved effective,  for the Finance Bill was finally passed by the Council of State in the form in which it was originally introduced,   and the Government were able to  justify the use of these powers hj shov^ing that a refusal of supply would have led to  a breakdown of essential services,   and that the amendment of the taxation proposals without any practicable alternative suggestions would haveere ated/
. &quot;&apos;vm        &apos; A   3.created a huge deficit.The last session may he safe, to have shown that the policy of obstruction, from within and the programme of unreasonable opposition on each and every occasion, merely with the object of lowering the prestige of the Government, cannot achieve any substantial success if the Government, recognising their responsibility to the country at large, make full use of the powers conferred on them.S.      It is not only in regard to the question of Council entry and acceptance of office that Congress appears to he in difficulties.    Reports from all provinces show that racruit-ment to Congress ranks under the scheme devised by Mr. Gandhi and approved by the Bombay Congress (vide the Appreciation for November,1934) has not been successful.    So slow has been the progress of recruitment that the elections have had to he postponed.    Congress have no new cry with which to attract recruits and though the All-India Congress Committee unanimously resolved that the present policy of drift cannot continue there were divergent views as to what should he done. 4.      In regard to one matter the Committee appear to have arrived at a decision without any opposition!  this was in regard to proposals to  agitate for the release,  or at least some  amelioration of the conditions of terrorist detenus in Bengal.    On this question it was decided that a, country wide agitation must be launched and numerous &quot;protest&quot; days held,   and that the Congress Parliamentary Board should be instructed to raise the question at the next session of the Assembly.    In accordance with this decision a Committee of Members of the Assembly has been appointedto/
to collect information end, for this purpose, has issued a lengthy questionnaire to various Congress Workers in Bengal, which, though ostensibly designed to collect information which would show that detention is unjustifiable,  is more likely to result in the collection of damaging and false stories of repressive action by the Police or by Troops.Both at those meetings and at a meeting of the Bengal. Provincial Congress Committee at Dinajpur there has been little or no outward or unequivocal condemnation of terrorism end no reference to the reasons which forced the Government to take this exceptional  eotion.    The Congress President&apos;s appeal for the observance of detenus day starts with the bald state-ment that &quot;It is a well-known fact that a large number of youths of Bengal are in detention without trial and without any opportunity being given them to clear themselves&quot; while a Member of the Legislative Assembly,  speaking at Dinajpur, referred to the &quot;Martyrdom of death-defying youths&quot;  and eulogised their &quot;patriotism,  self-sacrifice and heroism&quot;. Speeches of this type keep alive the terrorist&apos; mentality end as long as this mentality exists the Government must adopt a. very cautious policy in regard to the release.se of detenus.Though no serious outrage has occurred in Bengal recently, a recent incident in Ajmer, which has been known for some time past to be a. focus for such terrorists as there still are in Northern India, shows the ever present risk of sporadio outrages.    A police officer, who had been specially deputed to the area to investigate terrorist crimes end whose investigations were proving troublesome to terrorists, was shot when leaving a cinema, end his life was only saved bythe/
the gallantry of a Sub-Inspector who was with him &quot;both officers receiving very serious injuries.5.      The difficulties which confront loth Congress  and its left wing, tho Socialist Party, in stirring up opposition to the present form of Government among the rural classes are well exemplified by an account which has been received of a Kisan (peasants&apos;)  conference recently hold in the United Provinces.    The conference was presided over by Sorder Vallabhb-hai Pctel,  the champion of the tenants of Gujerat, but&apos;, though the No-rent Campaign of 1931-32 showed that the United Provinces was a favourable field of rural agitation, the attendance was not large.    Socialist attempts at demonstra-tions were a failure, hut a pamphlet distributed among the audience showed their views and policy.    Gandhi and Patel were attacked; the former had sand at Cawnpore that he would side with tho land-lords;  the latter was unwilling to usurp the land-holders1 rights.    The hollow promise of &quot;Swaraj&quot; by Congress had brought the peasants no relief and Congress had always shown themselves too ready to compromise with the Government.    They must themselves fight the 1end-holders and the Government to secure the  abolition of the. present system.Even more inflammatory pamphlets were distributed by the communists, hut the final result of the  conference was that the resolutions passed for the reduction of rents,  canal, dues etc *, were open to no objection;  the abolition of the landlord system was approved, but only subject to the payment of a, substantial compensation to the dispossessed landholders. 6.-     The communal situation still causes anxiety.    Uncertainty as to the relative position of tho two major communities under the new constitution is undoubtedly the underlying cause of strained feelings between them.    The criticism of
the Communal Award by Hindus end Sikhs end the failure of numerous attempts to get any agreed settlement, haws increase the strain. When feelings ere thus strained, the celebration of religious festivals is apt to give rise to clashes between the two com unities end this year the important Muhammad on festival of Moharram coincided with the Hindu festive!, of Ram Haumi.In Bihar end Orissa,  although, there wore few serious clashes,  trouble was narrowly averted in many places,  and it reported that the feelings of the Mullammadens were more than usually excited owing to the news of the Karachi incident having penetrated to this area.    In several places,  even places hitherto free from serious communal trouble,  this is said to have aroused a spirit of martyrdom among the Muhammadans which made thorn more intolerant then usuel.   A similar appreciation is given by the United Provinces Government who state that &quot;communal feeling generally has been more strained in the province this year then lestj magistrates end police have had more disputes to settle  end have found great difficulty in inducing the two communities to come to terms&quot;.In Punjab,  a dangerous situation arose in Multen city, where a Hindu,  accused of having insulted the. prophet, was murdered by four Muh rum. ad an s .    The murder of a four-year old Hindu boy a few days later and discovery of two other alleged murders of Hindus,  increased the excitement end apprehension.    Prompt steps were taken by local authorities to despatch troops end additional police to guard the city end to enforce orders to prevent riotous crowds collecting,end/
and this has proved successful in stopping any serious outbreak.    The agitation for an enquiry into thd Karachi incident appears to he subsiding, but as long as this continues it will inevitably increase communal feeling.
