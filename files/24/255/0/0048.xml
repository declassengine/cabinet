SECRET. Copy No.CP. 133 (35).CABINET.MEAT NEGOTIATIONS.Continuation of Cattle  Subsidy.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.THE provisions of the Cattle Industry (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1935, under which a subsidy from the Exchequer not exceeding 5s. per live cwt. is-payable to producers of fat cattle in the United Kingdom, expire on the 30th September next, when Parliament will be in recess.2. The period covered by this Act was limited to the six months April to September 1935 with the object of bringing pressure to bear on the Dominions and in the hope that the negotiations with the Dominions and Argentina on long-term policy would have reached a point which would have enabled us to present to Parliament and to pass into law before the recess legislation embodying proposals on the lines indicated in the White Paper of March 1935 (Cmd. 4828),. to come into operation on or before the 1st October, 1935. It is, unfortunately, clear that this is now out of the question. My colleagues will be aware that the negotiations have proved to be extremely difficult and protracted. The present position of the negotiations with the Dominions is not unpromising, but it will clearly be at best a matter of weeks, if not months, before. an agreement satisfactory to the United Kingdom, the Dominions and Argentina can be negotiated. Even after such an agreement has been successfully negotiated, there: is little doubt that the exporting countries affected by a levy system will ask for a suspensory period before the levies begin to operate, in order to allow for meat in transit and to give time for the Meat Conference, which is an integral feature of the plan at present under discussion, to be established and to begin its work-Further, there is no time before the House rises to get through a controversial Meat Bill, even one limited to providing, in anticipation of an agreement, the-necessary administrative machinery for the collection and disbursement of import levies, which in any case could not become effective before Parliament resumes.3. Meantime, the situation in the cattle section of the live-stock industry shows no improvement on the position as it stood a year ago. Throughout the year, foreign supplies have been subjected to the maximum reductions possible under current agreements, and drastic restrictions have been imposed on the Irish Free State: But other Dominions have increased their supplies to an extent which has neutralised the effect of these restrictions. The mean market price of 1st and 2nd quality fat cattle for the week ending the 5th September, 1934, was 38s. Qd. per live cwt. The weekly average price during succeeding weeks showed the usual seasonal decline, and reached 33s. lid. for the week ending the 5th December. The price rose as usual for the Christmas markets, but contrary to the usual trend of prices it continued to decline thereafter, and reached its[11800]&quot;printed for the Cabinet.   June 1935.
lowest point during the week ending the 3rd April,, when it stood at 33s. 2d., 3s. lid. below the average price recorded for the corresponding week in 1934. The average price then advanced and reached- 36s. Id: for the week ending the 19th June. That figure was, however, still Qd. below last year&apos;s figure. Prices this week are 35s. Q^d. or 2s. below those for the corresponding week of last year.4. In these circumstances there appears to be no alternative but to contemplate a further short-term Bill on the lines of and extending the period of the existing Act.5. In the negotiations with the Dominions and with Argentina all the cards are now on the table and it is, I suggest, desirable to make provision which will cover either of the two situations which may arise during the next fifteen months. If an agreement is reached, it will be necessary to continue direct assistance until such time as it can be replaced by the agreed levy-subsidy arrangements brought into operation as the result of long-term policy worked out and embodied in legislation. If we can get this working by April next we shall have done well. It is safer to assume that it may not be achieved before June. On the other hand, if no agreement is reached, the only alternative (other than a continuation of the Exchequer subsidy) will be the drastic reduction of imports foreshadowed in the White Papers of July 1934 and March 1935. We have always felt doubtful whether it would be possible, in fact, to impose this on the Dominions, and I think it is generally recognised that an attempt to raise cattle prices in this country to remunerative levels by severe cuts on Dominion imports would in present circumstances be politically impracticable.6. I suggest, therefore, that we should make contingent provision for a continuation of the subsidy up to the end of September 1936, by which time we shall be within measurable distance of the expiry of the present Anglo-Argentine Agreement in November 1936.7. I recommend, therefore, that a Bill to extend the period during which subsidy payments may be made to United Kingdom cattle producers should be introduced and passed before the House rises for the summer recess; and that the extension should be from the end of September 1935, when the present legislation expires, until the end of June 1936 (nine months), with power to extend by Order of the Appropriate Ministers, if circumstances so require, for a further and final period not exceeding three months to the end of September 1936, the Order being subject to approval by resolution of each House of Parliament. This Bill will have to be founded on a Financial Resolution. In introducing the Financial Resolution it is, I think, necessary to make it clear that the further payments to be made are, like those already made from the Exchequer, advances which will be recoverable from the Cattle Fund by the Exchequer, as circum-stances may permit, when the former comes to be fed from the proceeds of the levy.8. It is estimated that the total liability on the Exchequer of the payments contemplated under the Bill will not exceed  4 million.9. If the proposals which I have put forward above are approved by my colleagues, provision for the expenditure which will be incurred during the last six months of the present financial year could be made when the Supplementary Estimate, which is already necessary in connection with the operations under the present Act, is presented. In order that this may be possible the Financial Resolution covering these proposals would have to be on the Order Paper by the 5th July. In these circumstances, a draft of a Bill on the lines indicated above has been prepared, and is attached to the present Memorandum. I should be glad, if my colleagues approve the proposals in principle, to have authority to take the necessary Parliamentary steps immediately after the Bill has been considered and approved by the Home Affairs Committee.
10. The time for communicating this decision to the meat exporting countries would be carefully considered with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and-the President,of the Board of Trade. v...:.:11. The proposals put forward in this Memorandum have been communi-cated to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Secretary of State for the Home Department, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, and the President of the Board of Trade, who all, I think, agree that action along these lines is necessary. -  -    .. -      .(Initialled) W.
