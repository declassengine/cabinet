SEVENTEENTH  REPORT.Survey of the economic situation, May 1935.BY our terms of reference we are directed to supervise the preparation of periodical reports on the economic situation; and in accordance with these instructions, we now submit the seventeenth of these periodical reports. The report represents the general views of the committee, without attempting to express the different shades of opinion held by individual members.2. In part 1, we summarise the chief economic events of recent months. In part 2, we discuss certain aspects of the present situation.3. This report was prepared before the recent development of the situation in France had given ground for supposing that the abandonment of the existing gold parity in that country was imminent.4. During the preparation of the present report, Sir Josiah Stamp has been absent in the United States, and we have invited Sir Arthur Salter to act as our chairman during this period.(Signed on behalf of the committee) : ARTHUR SALTER.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, May 24, 1935.[11610]
SURVEY OF  THE  ECONOMIC SITUATION,  MAY  193S.Part 1. Summary of recent economic events.RECENT months have seen a period of pronounced instability in foreign exchange markets. The weakness of sterling which we noticed in our last report became more pronounced in March and gave rise to considerable apprehension on the Continent. The French franc, which had stood in the neighbourhood of 74 to the pound in December and January, rose to 70 - 66 in the beginning of March. As a continuance of this fall in the value of sterling must inevitably have made the difficulties of the less strongly placed members of the gold bloc insupportable, the weakness of sterling gave rise to fears as to the stability of the lesser gold currencies, particularly of the belga. During the latter part of March, a serious flight from the belga took place which it proved impossible to arrest, even after the imposition of stringent exchange regulations, and on the 1st April the belga was devalued. Under the new currency law the gold content of the belga is to be fixed at between 70 and 75 per cent, of the previous content, and in the meantime the belga is to be stabilised at 72 per cent, of its old value. This step has naturally considerably relieved the financial difficulties of Belgium, and the national bank, which had previously lost a considerable proportion of its gold reserve, is now accumulating gold in large quantities.2. The collapse of the belga was held in many circles to foreshadow the collapse of the lesser gold currencies and a considerable speculative flight of capital from Holland and Switzerland is taking place. So far, however, these currencies have been able to resist the strain imposed upon them, though both in Holland, and to a lesser degree in Switzerland, a number of precautionary measures have been taken. The bank rate was raised in Holland in two stages from 2-J per cent, to 4^ per cent., though it was subsequently reduced to 4 per cent. New budgetary economies were also announced. In Switzerland the bank rate has been raised from 2 per cent, to 2-J- per cent. The Swiss position is complicated by the necessity of holding a referendum regarding future monetary policy on the 2nd June. In the case of both these currencies the forward rate stands at a considerable discount in relation to the spot rate.3. At the end of February and the early part of March the dollar stood at a discount in the terms of the French franc, but since apprehension as to the stability of the gold bloc currencies has become wide-spread, the dollar has regained its normal premium over the franc and gold has flowed to America in large quantities. The movements of the dollar and the French franc are given in Tables 1 and 2.Table 1.Average of mean daily rates of exchange in 1933 and 1934.New York dollars to  .

The violent fluctuations which have occurred in exchange rates have been reflected in substantial gold movements. In March the Belgian National Bank lost gold heavily. In April, gold was lost by the Bank of France and by the Netherlands Bank and the Swiss Bank. The growth of the gold reserves of the United States, which had slowed down in March, was resumed in its full strength in April. In that month the Belgian National Bank also regained large quantities of gold.Table 3.Gold holdings of the principal central banks.(000,000&apos;s omitted.)Date. End of-	Bank of France.

The flow of gold to London for hoarding purposes was temporarily reversed in February, in which month there was an excess of exports of gold of approximately  7f millions. It was resumed, however, in March, in which month the excess imports of gold amounted to nearly  13^ millions. This movement was continued in April, when over  6 millions were imported. This figure, however, under-estimates the true net import, as  20 millions of gold, previously held in this country by the Bank of France, was exported to France in this month. The nature and scope of the important movements of gold between the principal countries since the beginning of last October are shown in the following table : Table 4.Gold movements between the principal countries: October 1934 to March 1935.(in millions of United States dollars.)

A further notable development in the exchange and bullion market has been the rapid appreciation of silver, which has risen from a price of approximately 2s. per oz. in February, to as high as 3s. per oz. in the course of April, though recently the price of silver has relapsed to 2s. 8d. This rise was attributable in part to direct purchases on account of the American Treasury. But it is now largely based on the speculative buying of silver in anticipation of further purchases on the part of the American Treasury. The value of the exports of silver from London to the United States since the beginning of 1934 have been as follows :  January to June 1934   ... ... ... 760,000July to September 1934 ... ... ...        5,320,000October to December 1934 ... ...        2,390,000January to March 1935 ... ... ...        8,620,000The rise in the price of silver has been reflected in the rise in the price of the Shanghai dollar, even though this is protected to some extent by a tax on the export of silver from China. The price of the Hong Kong dollar, which has no such protection, has risen proportionately with the rise in the price of silver. The following table gives the price of silver, the price of the Shanghai dollar and of the Hong Kong dollar :

The short-term rates of interest in the London money market remain under the influence of the arrangement entered into by the clearing banks last February regarding the rate at which they would tender for treasury bills. Throughout March and April the rate of discount on treasury bills had been very slightly in excess of 10s. per cent. During the first quarter of 1935 there was the usual seasonal decline in the bills held by the clearing banks, the total falling from  284 millions in January &quot;to  199 millions in April. In the same period deposits fell from  1,982 millions to  1,940 millions, the fall being smaller mainly because of an increase in investments from  593 millions to  618 millions, and in advances from  753 millions to  775 millions. This increase of  25 millions in investments forms part of an increase which has been going on almost continuously since April 1934, when the investment total was  534 millions, i.e.,  84 millions less than in April 1935. The other assets held by the clearing banks show only very small changes since April 1934, while deposits have grown by  88 millions. The changes in the level of deposits indicated&apos;by these figures have not been brought about by any variation in the amount of cash held by clearing banks, which, except for a few seasonal changes, has remained practically steady at  215 millions. They are rather a continuation of a process which began in March 1933, when deposits stood at  1,925 millions, investments at  509 millions, and bills at  348 millions. In the autumn of that year and the spring of 1934, the Government carried out funding operations which had the effect of making about  160 millions available for the reduction of floating debt. The stocks then issued were largely absorbed by the public, though the reduction was largely at the expense of the clearing hanks&apos; holdings of Treasury bills. Thus, the assets of the banks were reduced by the extent of the funding operations, and the deposits of their customers reduced by the same amount. Nevertheless, the banks&apos; holding of cash was practically the same. In April 1934, therefore, the cash ratios of the banks were unusually high, and the banks needed only little encouragement last autumn to expand their assets and thus restore their deposits and cash ratios to the level obtaining two years before. The competition for Treasury bills was so strong that the banks were unable to obtain enough of these to expand their assets in that direction at remunerative rates, and they were driven once more into the gilt-edged market, all the more so from the fear that the Treasury might soon exercise its option to repay a large part of the Treasury 3 per cent, bonds, and possibly the whole of the issue of 2 per cent, bonds. Thus, the banks only extended their holdings of gilt-edged securities under pressure. In so far, how-ever, as this pressure helped to promote the Government policy of cheap money, this course of action must be held to have been justified, even though it resulted in some inconvenience to the banks.Table 5.

The decline in the value of securities which began in February was continued in March, though in that month there was some recovery in the values of ordinary shares. In April, however, the gilt-edged market appears to have been definitely stronger, and though it.has not recovered to the full the losses sustained between January and March, fixed interest securities have resumed their upward trend partly as the result of an inflow of foreign balances. Ordinary shares have recently shown considerable strength.Table 7.London prices of stocks and shares from the end of June 1934.

American prices are continuing to show on the whole a rising tendency. This rise, however, is entirely attributable to a rise in the value of farm products. Industrial prices are showing, if anything, a slight tendency to fall. French prices have recently shown a fairly sharp fall and are now some 15 per cent, lower than the year before. German prices have recently been stable; but it must be borne in mind that the prices upon which the index is based are increasingly subject to official market control and, possibly no longer reflect the true movements of internal prices.[11610] .....c        &quot;

It will be observed that though employment has risen by 175,000 since April, 1934, unemployment has only fallen by 41,000. Employment in the first quarter of 1935 was at a substantially lower level than that prevailing in the latter part of 1934. In April, however, employment showed considerably more than its normal seasonal expansion and appears to have regained the level prevailing in December last.10. Building plans approved by local authorities in the first quarter of 1935 showed a very marked expansion, both as regards industrial buildings and dwelling houses.   Building plans approved are subject to a definite seasonal
variation. If this variation is allowed for, the value of plans passed during each quarter since the beginning of 1932 would have been as follows: Table 11.Building plans approved by 146 local authorities (not including theLondon County Council).(-  millions.)(corrected for normal seasonal variations.)

The output of steel in the first quarter of the year continued to be satisfactory, the monthly output for March being the highest recorded since October 1929. The following table shows that there has also been an increase in the volume of steel retained in this country for use in the metal consuming industries, 2,198 million tons being retained in the first quarter of 1935 as compared with 2,138 in the first quarter of 1934, an increase of 3 per cent. : Table 12.Consumption of steel in Great Britain.

12. Retail trade appears to have been very satisfactory in January and Eebruary; the March figures showed an improvement of only -6 per cent, in comparison with last year. The incidence of Easter, however, very materially affects retail sales at this time of the year, and, allowing for this, the recorded increase appears to have been quite satisfactory.Table 13.Value of average daily retail sales in Great Britain reported to the Bank ofEngland since 1932.(average for the year 1933 = 100.)MonthJanuary February March April May June July August September October November DecemberYear1932.	1933.	1934.	1935.104	97	101	10591	88	91	9597	94	99	100104	104	101	105	100	108	100	101	103	100	99	102	86	86	90	94	93	97	101	102	105	101	104	108	126	131	.134	101	100	103	13. American business activity is continuing near the improved level which it reached at the beginning of this year, though there is a slight downward tendency. The most satisfactory section of American industry continued to be the production of motor cars. The improvement in the general level of activity has not extended to the textile industries. The cotton manufacturing industry, in particular, is badly situated, and complaints are being made of the adverse effects of the processing tax on raw cotton, both on home consumption and on the export trade. Little progress has been made in Congress with the President&apos;s programme of social legislation, though he has secured the passage of the bill authorising expenditure on public works in a form satisfactory to him. This bill contemplates a substantial increase in the excess of government expenditure over government receipts. Recently, however, there appears to have been a diminution in the rate at which government debt has been increasing, and in March, for the first time since March, 1933, there was an excess of government receipts over government expenditure. This must, however, be looked upon as temporary in view of the very heavy receipts on the account of income tax in the course of that month. In the following table we give the index of employment and industrial production since the middle of 1933 :

The index for factory employment is based upon data supplied by a much greater number of industries than are directly represented in the index of industrial production.14. The more recent trade statistics suggest that April was not such a satisfactory month as March. The New York Times index of business activity is given in the following table. The decline in the index for the week ending the 27th April is largely to be attributed to a falling off in railway freight receipts. This is a temporary phenomenon, and is to be explained by the anticipation in previous weeks of the coming into force of higher rates for certain classes of freight traffic : Table 15.New York Times Index of Business Activity.

The decline in the value of sterling together with the slow but continuous rise in the level of American prices has brought the costs of production in America more nearly into line with those in Great Britain than has been the case at any time since the summer of 1933. In the following table we give indices of wage rates, of wholesale and retail prices and of the value of the pound sterling recal-culated with March 1933 as base. The figures suggest that the discrepancy now existing between British and American costs has been considerably narrowed in the course of the last year and that, on the assumption that American and British costs were in equilibrium in March 1933, this discrepancy amounted to about 10 per cent. In considering, however, the power of American industry to compete in world markets, other factors besides cost of production are relevant, notably, changes in the efficiency of American industry and the margin of profit which manufacturers require before they undertake an export transaction.Factory employment and industrial production in the United States.*(Bureau of Labor Statistics and Federal Eeserve Board indices adjusted forseasonal variations.)

April has seen a considerable improvement in the level of industrial ordinary shares on the New York stock exchange. Bond prices are also higher than in March, but have not apparently reached the level obtaining in January and February. The Federal Treasury is undertaking a large programme of conversion at very low rates of interest; and Government stocks are standing at a higher level to-day than at any time in the past two years.Table 17.Security prices in the United States.

There has been no very marked change in the level of production and employment in France since the end of the year, though the number of unemployed workers in receipt of relief have recently shown more than the usual seasonal decline. The improvements in the price of securities which were noticed in our last report have not been maintained, partly as a result of the disturbed conditionsWages, prices, and the value of sterling in the United States since 1933.
of the principal European exchanges and partly as a result of the worsened inter-national political outlook. The following table shows the course of industrial production and employment in France since the middle of 1933 :-Table 18.Employment and industrial production in France.(Index of production prepared by the Statistique generate: base, 1913 = 100.

The general trend of production and employment in Germany continues to be upward; but the divergence between the fortunes of those industries principally devoted to the production of investment goods and those principally devoted to the production of consumers&apos; goods is becoming more marked. Industries of the latter class are apparently more affected by restrictions on the market of raw materials than those, of the former class.Table 19.Employment and production in Germany since January 1933.

It will be observed that, after allowing for the normal seasonal movement, there appears to have been a decline in the volume of world trade for the fourth quarter of 1934. The gold value of trade in January and February remained low :  Table 20. World trade.(League of Nations index of the gold value of imports and exports and of thequantum of trade, base 1929 = 100.)

British exports, on the other hand, remain comparatively satisfactory. The increase over the corresponding month in the previous year for each month since January, 1934, is given in the following table. It will be seen, however,, that the figure for March is not quite as satisfactory as that in the preceding month: Table 21.The monthly increase in British exports since January 1934 as a percentage of the exports in the corresponding months in the previous year.8-2 1934 October --- 7 ft1934 January --- g.;j              November ... --- g &quot;February ... - - &quot; &quot;              December ... ---      XJl*March ... - \lAPril- - - 6-5 19 2May --- - 12.8 1935 January ...      -      Vl\June ... --- --- *   Q              February ...      --- j* *July.- - - %l              March ...      - g-7August ... --- 0         april ... miSeptember ...

Part 2. The economic situation, May 1935.I. Introductory.23. When in February last we prepared our last periodical report, there were signs that the rate of recovery in the economic position of Great Britain was slackening, and we expressed some doubt as to the immediate prospects. However, the trade reports which have appeared since that date have, on the whole, been of a reassuring character. Many important indices have shown an improvement. The value of building plans approved, and the volume of iron and steel produced, in the first quarter of this year indicate that the capital-producing industries are likely to show further improvement in the near future. Retail trade appears to have shown a further expansion in January and February, and the improvement in export trade has been maintained. At the same time, employment as a whole showed in February and March no more than the usual seasonal improvement over January, and was, after allowing for normal seasonal changes, somewhat lower in the first quarter of 1935 than in the fourth quarter of 1934. The April figure, indeed, is encouraging, and if no allowance is made for any special features of last month&apos;s count, would indicate that employment had regained the level prevailing before Christmas. But there appear to have been a number of instances in which employment was temporarily stimulated by the desire to complete orders before Easter, and the implications of the figures can only be accepted with some reserve. These developments alone could not decide the question whether the check in the progress of recovery which was observable at the beginning of this year was merely a temporary break in an upward movement, or whether it foreshadowed a more permanent change. But taken in conjunction with the more optimistic tone prevailing in business and financial circles, and with the satisfactory situation of many industries with regard to orders for future delivery, they afford us ground for anticipating that the coming summer will witness a further improvement in the general level of British business activity.24. The maintenance of conditions compatible with continued recovery in this country was, we suggested in our last report, dependent on comparatively favourable developments in two fields. In the first place, it was essential that confidence in the existing: level of British security prices should be fully main-tained. Secondly, it was of almost equal importance that the existing level of world trade should not be endangered by deflationary developments in continental Europe. The events of the last three months have definitely lessened the dangers from the first of these quarters. Not only has confidence in the possibility of maintaining interest rates at their present level shown a marked revival, but there has also been an influx of funds for investment from the continent which, for the moment at any rate, has been of assistance to the gilt-edged market, though their presence is, of course, not a factor making for ultimate stability. On the other hand, the developments of the European situation have been of a conflicting nature. The defection of Belgium from the gold bloc has temporarily served to create conditions of financial uncertainty, which are having harmful repercussions on economic activity within the gold bloc countries. At the same time, there is a growing realisation of the fact that the policy of deflation has failed; and it has, indeed, been explicitly repudiated by all the countries of Europe with the exception of Holland. But attempts to adopt more expansive policies are still hampered by the inappropriate levels at which the majority of continental exchanges now stand.II. International financial outlook.25. The direct effects of the Belgian devaluation on the volume of world trade should not be harmful. In common with other members of the gold bloc, Belgium had recently achieved a comparatively favourable balance of trade as a result of reduced purchases of foreign goods. Belgium is therefore unlikely to adopt active measures for curtailing the future level of imports to protect her
currency on its altered basis. If, as is almost inevitable, Belgian economic activity receives some stimulus as a consequence of the devaluation, Belgian imports should expand at least proportionately, and increased purchases on Belgian account, together with the improvement in the purchasing power of those markets which benefit unequivocally from increased Belgian purchases, should in the case of most industrial countries serve to offset the loss both of exports and of internal trade which more intense Belgian competition will entail. The Belgian Government, moreover, intends to maintain the external price of its exports as far as is possible, and does not wish to force its goods on to world markets. To a considerable extent the volume of Belgian exports is regulated by cartel agreements, and where this is not already the case the Government intends, if necessary, to control exports by a system of export licences. Thus new Belgian competition will be kept within reasonable limits. Nor will all industrial countries be affected by it in the same way. Those whose costs are comparatively low will secure a larger share of any increased demand for manufactured goods which may result from a higher degree of activity in Belgium than will those whose costs are comparatively high. Thus the new situation may prove tolerable to those countries whose position is comparatively satisfactory, but may enhance the difficulties of those whose position is already insecure.26. But much more serious than the mechanical effects of the Belgian devaluation are likely to be its repercussions on sentiment in the remaining countries of the gold bloc. Every defection from orthodoxy inevitably strengthens the unorthodox party in other countries. * If the Belgian rentier does not suffer from devaluation to the exaggerated extent which was foretold before the event, the opposition to devaluation elsewhere will lose much of its-effectiveness. This weakened opposition will have to meet the growing discontent of those special interests which stand to suffer from increased Belgian competition. And in the meantime the remaining gold bloc countries will be perpetually embarrassed by the anticipation of a devaluation which will1 increasingly appear to be inevitable. The fall of the belga. was immediately followed by the withdrawal of funds from Holland and Switzerland, and this tendency has since spread to France in a still more marked degree. Though for the moment these withdrawals have not made the maintenance of the gold parity impossible, they are likely to be continued, and may force the financial authorities in the countries concerned to pursue a more restrictive policy. Thus the immediate effect of the defection of Belgium from the gold bloc has been an accentuationsof the financial difficulties of the countries remaining within it.27. These developments have been most marked in Holland, where the traditional remedies for the defence of the currency have been employed. To^ prevent losses of gold by the central bank being offset by new borrowing from it, the bank rate was raised from 2^ to 4% per cent., though it was subsequently reduced to 4 per cent. Further budgetary economies have also* been announced. These measures are only possible thanks to the very liquid position maintained by the Dutch banking system; in other circumstances they would lead to a collapse of the credit structure of the country. But even so, their effectiveness in the present circumstances is not likely to be great, Industrial stagnation is already far advanced; the percentage of unemployment recorded by the unemployment insurance societies had already reached the figure of 38-0 in February compared with 31-8 a year before, and the index of production in the same month only reached 69 per cent, of the average for 1928. In these circumstances it is idle to expect that any conceivable decline in the level of internal activity will either bring about a substantial fall in internal costs of production or will secure an improvement in the balance of payments in any way commensurable with the flight of capital which is taking place. Nor indeed could any practicable increase in the internal rates of interest be enough to deter speculators who hope to gain a capital profit of at least 25 per cent, within three months or less. Thus the orthodox remedies are quite powerless to check an overwhelming flight of capital, except in so far as they show that the government is determined to pursue a deflationary policy to its logical limits. Ultimately,, however, this question must be decided not by the determination of the govern-ment to impose burdens on the people, but by the willingness of the people to[11610] d 2
support them; and those who are anxious as to the safety Of their capital are in as favourable a position to answer this, question as is the government.28. The Swiss currency is also at the moment under pressure. In this case the question is complicated by the referendum which is to be held on the 2nd June regarding the continuance of a deflationary financial policy. It is generally believed that if the result of the referendum were to impose on the government the obligation of pursuing a more liberal policy, it would be impossible for Switzer-land to maintain the existing parity of the franc with gold. Thus, though it is generally anticipated that the referendum will be adverse to the proposals, the government is for the moment debarred from adopting measures in defence of the franc which are likely to prejudice the results of the referendum. In these circumstances the drain of funds has been met in part by the support of the franc in the futures market, and in part has been permitted to have its natural effect of depleting the gold reserves.29. These developments have had unfavourable reactions in France. The uncertain financial and international conditions prevailing in Europe, together with renewed budgetary difficulties, have reversed the upward movement in French long-term securities which we noticed in our last report. For instance 3 per cent, rentes, which at the time of the preparation of that report stood at 82, have now fallen to 77. Nor is the modestly inflationary programme which we then described likely to make any substantial headway in the face of the dangers of the new situation. Discussing this programme, we took the view that success in the attempt to establish lower interest rates in France was likely to postpone, rather than advance the date of the devaluation of the franc, which since the stabilisation of the dollar at its new parity we have always considered highly probable. The disturbed state of the money markets in Holland and Switzerland must render the successful completion of the French governments financial programme very unlikely. The events of recent months must therefore be held to have increased the probability of an early devaluation of the franc, and to have diminished the probability of any substantial revival of French trade before that occurs. Since December the French index of production has been stationary at about 73 per cent, of the level of 1928, and the index of employment confirms this suggestion of comparative stability. But the rapid decline which occurred in 1934 could hardly have been continued indefinitely, and the fact that it may have been temporarily arrested cannot be taken as an indication of any real improvement in the situation. Indeed the outlook in France is, at the moment, almost uniformly unfavourable; and we see no prospect of any change for the better so long as the present gold parity is maintained. It is interesting to observe that the arguments of M. Paul Reynaud in favour of devaluation, which were for a long time disregarded, are now attracting an increasing measure of attention.30. The repercussions of the Belgian devaluation on the financial prospects of the remaining gold countries have thus been wholly of an unfavourable nature. We have therefore to set against the possible favourable effects of the cessation of a deflationary policy in that. country, the much more serious disadvantages of an intensification of financial uncertainty over a much wider area. In addition the Belgian devaluation is likely to aggravate the difficulties of Germany and Italy, who are attempting, by means of a growingly complicated system of exchange and foreign trade regulations, to combine the maintenance of an unduly high external value of their currencies with a programme of state supported internal expansion. For, as we have already observed, countries whose export prices are comparatively high are likely to benefit only to a small degree from any expansion in industrial purchases which may be induced by more active conditions of trade in Belgium, while at the same time they are likely to be extremely vulnerable to Belgian competition in neutral markets.31. Events indeed are daily illustrating the fundamental difficulty of the policy being pursued in Germany and now to be imitated in Italy, of promoting an expansion.of the home market without regard to the availability of adequate foreign exchange resources. Any developed industrial country is necessarily dependent on imported materials and manufactures over a large range of goods that normally enter into consumption. As internal activity expands the demand for these goods increases proportionately, and extra exports are required to pay for them-   Since the price of goods normally exported are determined by world
-conditions, they must remain fixed in terms of the national currency, and there is no profit to the manufacturer in expanding his output for export. He is indeed constantly tempted to transfer his output from the unprofitable export market to the profitable home market; and exports do not expand proportionately with the need for foreign exchange to finance increasing imports. It follows that the development of internal activity is inevitably checked by a shortage of imported goods, reflected in a substantial increase in their price. We may instance the very considerable rise which has taken place both in Germany and in Italy in the price of wool, as the result of the restriction placed upon its importation. Germany has adopted many expedients to avoid this difficulty, so far with com-paratively small success. As a consequence, though recovery has proceeded steadily in the industries supplying investment goods, in the production of which Germany is to a large degree self-supporting, the production of goods for consumption, which cannot proceed without considerable imports, has made less progress, and indeed has recently been declining. More drastic measures have lately been proposed to secure an adequate supply of goods for export. A levy is to be imposed on the proceeds of all industry out of which a subsidy will be paid on all goods exported. The levy is to vary from industry to industry and is to be so fixed as to secure an equivalence between German and world prices of the goods in question. Should this proposal be put into practice Germany will have taken a further step towards the abandonment of the gold standard. There will no longer be any connection either between German prices and world prices, or between the German currency and other currencies. By means of a cumbrous and unequal system of regulations, she will have secured for herself the advantage of being able to allow her internal price level to move in accordance with the needs of the internal situation. She will at the same time have avoided an overt act of devaluation, though the system of regulated imports and subsidised exports is the price she has had to pay to avoid it.32. The events of the last few months have given prominence to the fundamental stresses to which the economic systems of the countries of western Europe are subject. They have also made it plain that there is small chance of even a temporary revival in European trade until these underlying stresses have been removed. We anticipate therefore that there will be a progressive deterioration-tion in the European situation until the final devaluation of the franc. How soon that event will occur it is still impossible to predict. The French financial system has shown surprising powers of resistance to adverse economic circumstances. The franc is based on such a vast reserve of gold that it is practically invulnerable to speculative attack. In the face of a threatening international situation it is quite possible that the French people will endure economic adversity more readily than they would in less disturbed times. For all these reasons it would be imprudent to assign too early a date to the inevitable crisis. It would be equally imprudent to overlook the possibility that it may occur very soon.III. Developments in the United States.33. On the other hand, there are signs that the revival of American activity is based on more secure foundations than any of the half speculative advances which have occurred since the crisis of 1933. As we indicated in our last report, the most important change in the economic background in that country has been the growing effect of the pressure of increasing bank deposits in producing a general anticipation that a period of cheap money lies ahead. As is shown in the tables in the first section of this report, there has recently been a considerable rise in the prices of American common stocks. This, indeed, has frequently occurred previously, and has been as often succeeded by a serious recession. But the present upward movement appears to be qualitatively rather different from its predecessors; for the rise has been most marked not in those securities which show the greatest possibility of an increase in earnings in the event of a general business improvement, but rather in those securities which have a consistent record of dividend payments. That is to say, the improvement has been based on investment considerations. It is therefore more likely to be permanent. At the same time, it appears that the market for fixed interest securities, though there has been no rise in the general level of values, is in a much stronger condition than hitherto, and refunding operations are again beginning to be possible.   If these movements are sustained they must inevitably generate
a feeling of security and liquidity, both among the consuming public, and in the minds of the directors of business organisations, such as has not been known for a number of years; and a recovery based upon such foundations might progress far. We do not believe that the American public, in its present mood, is likely to be greatly disturbed by the prospect of the continuation of expenditure of large sums of public funds on relief works. This may now seem to have become almost a permanent feature of the American economy, and, as such, is less and less likely to excite remark. Moreover, the expenditure of these funds is probably still necessary if the American consumption is to be maintained at its present level.34. A further feature of the American situation, which must be regarded as very satisfactory from the point of view of world equilibrium, is the diminution that is taking place this year in the favourable balance of American external trade. In part this may be attributed to the gradual approximation which has taken place between American and British costs of production. The table which we have given in the first part of this report (table 16) indicates that American costs have now risen in terms of dollars to an extent sufficient to offset the greater part of their decline in terms of sterling, which was brought about by the depreciation of the dollar in 1933. But much more important than this has been the considerable falling off in the exports of American agricultural produce, particularly of cotton.35. The decline in American agricultural exports is a reflection of what is perhaps the most important practical effect of the &quot; New Deal &quot; legislation, namely, the rehabilitation of the American agricultural areas. This has been effected in part by the unexpected intervention of natural forces, which have, apparently permanently, diminished the fertility of large tracts of agricultural land, and have thus reduced the problem of the over-extension of agricultural production to manageable proportions. But natural forces have been supple-mented by artificial restriction schemes, and these in turn have been made tolerable by the large proportion of the emergency expenditure which has been devoted to projects in rural areas. Thus the agricultural districts have benefited not only by the higher prices which restriction has secured for their produce, but also by the alternative occupations provided for those displaced by natural misfortunes and by the restriction schemes themselves, in public works financed predominantly by the surplus savings of the industrial communities. The result is apparent not only in the rise of agricultural prices relatively to those of industrial goods, but also in the more than proportionate increase in bank deposits in country districts.36. This change in the relative prosperity of agricultural and industrial America has an international, as well as an American, significance. It was always obvious that if the problem of the American surplus of income from international trade was not solved by permitting the importation of foreign goods on a much more substantial scale than formerly, one-branch of American exports would have to be sacrificed. The choice before the American people was whether they should sacrifice their industrial or their agricultural exports. In the former case the ratio between agricultural and industrial prices would have had to have been maintained at a level which perpetuated the relatively unf favour-able position of the agricultural community, so that America should remain a country in which industrial goods were relatively dear and agricultural goods relatively cheap. Events, however, and conscious choice have decided in favour of the alternative policy, and America judged by world standards is at the moment a country where agricultural prices are relatively high and industrial prices relatively low. This condition is not likely to be reversed unless the-American people decide to adopt a system of export bounties on agricultural produce. A continuance of the present policy will in the long run react unfavourably upon the standard of well being which it will be possible to maintain in Great Britain. For this country must always remain a buyer of American agricultural produce, and a competitor with American industrial producers in world markets. But in the short run, in view of the large surplus capacity existing in our staple exporting industries, the present policy may have some compensating advantages for us. For the higher prices asked for American agricultural exports should insure higher prices for the exports of those countries which are in competition with American agricultural districts;.
and&apos;the improved purchasing power which should thus accrue to them should provide an expanded market for many of our staple exports.37. Though, in the main, developments in America have been of a character favourable to the immediate prospects of British industry, the increasing price that is being asked for silver as a result of the American silver-buying policy must be looked upon as a dangerous development. In so far as this policy results in the accumulation in America of a large quantity of silver derived from unused Indian and European hoards, it is perhaps a satisfactory way of meeting the current claims of Americans arising out of the favourable balance of payments. But the policy must be judged principally by its repercussions on Chinese economic life; and these are likely to be entirely unfavourable. Though copper and not silver is the currency in use for the bulk of current purchases, Chinese debts and long-period contracts are generally expressed in terms of the silver dollar, which fluctuates from day to day in terms of the copper currency. Silver is the basis ;of all financial transactions, and is the currency in which foreign trade is carried on. Thus, a shortage of silver has caused and will cause further grave disturbance in financial and trading circles. The effect of the rising price of silver on world markets has been to deplete the silver reserves of the country, which are largely held by the Chinese banks in Shanghai. In an attempt to prevent this drain, and to avoid a sudden appreciation of the exchange values of the Chinese dollar, the Chinese government last summer imposed an export tax on silver; but in view of the ease with which smuggling takes place there is a limit to the divergence which can exist between the internal value of silver in China, and its value in world markets. The position of the Chinese banks is thus becoming increasingly precarious and there is a growing danger that if the price of silver continues to rise the ordinary machinery of international, and indeed internal, trade in China will be brought to a standstill.38. In all the circumstances we cannot anticipate that there will be during the remainder of this year any marked revival in the level of British exports. The European trading position cannot show any improvement until some solution has been found for the exchange difficulties of the countries still actually or nominally maintaining their gold exchange parities. Nor is the first effect of the abandonment of these parities likely to be wholly beneficial to this country. To the existing centre of disturbance caused by the over-valuation of ,a number of European gold currencies, there must now be added a secondary disturbance caused by the over-valuation of the Chinese dollar. How great an effect this will have upon the trading position of the far east, it is perhaps too early to judge. Though we may look for some increase in trade with America and perhaps with the countries of the sterling area and other countries producing primary commodities, this increase cannot be very great so long as a large part of the rest of the world is under the influence of depression.IV. Limitations to the rate of progress in Great Britain.39. The conclusions which we have reached in the preceding sections may be recapitulated as follows. The slight deterioration in domestic conditions which we observed last February appears to have passed, and we may anticipate a continuation for some time of the process of purely internal recovery, which has played such a large part in the expansion of employment and production in this country since 1933. On the other hand, the outlook for external trade is not bright. The difficulties of the gold bloc countries have been accentuated, and serious financial uncertainty will continue to obstruct progress in continental Europe. The American outlook is probably brighter than for some time past, and further progress may be hoped for in the sterling area. There may, however, be a considerable worsening in the position of the far eastern countries. In these circumstances, we cannot expect that there will be any rapid rate of improvement in the overseas demand for British exports in the near future. That under these conditions the improvement in production and employment must be seriously retarded can be accepted without argument; but we do not fully accept the view sometimes advanced that we have reached a point from which no further advance can be anticipated unless there is an improvement in foreign trade.40.. Broadly speaking, employment may be prevented from expanding up to the limits set by the available labour force by one of two causes.   In the first
place, there may be a deficiency in the demand for the output of additional workers taken into employment. If employment expands in any proportion, the incomes of the community may be assumed to expand by a like amount, and so. may the outlay of money in those uses which do not immediately require the employment of British labour for their satisfaction, namely, the share of income which is saved and not spent, and the share of income which is-spent on the produce of foreign work-people. In a state of equilibrium, this share of income which is not directly spent in the employment of British workpeople is balanced by that demand for the produce of British workpeople which does not arise directly from the expenditure of British incomes, namely demand for labour for the production of capital goods, and for the production of goods for exports. The demand for labour in these latter categories is, within certain limits/ independent of the general level of British incomes. It may, therefore, be said that considering only a period during which more fundamental readjustments cannot take place, the total number of British workpeople for the product of whose labour there will be an adequate demand is directly determined by the numbers who are being found employment in the production of capital goods, and of goods for export. It is for this reason that particular importance attaches in periods of severe unemployment to the development of demand in these latter industries.41. But employment may be limited even in circumstances in which there is no deficiency of total purchasing power, by the fact that the available surplus of labour is not qualitatively suitable for the production of the goods and services which would be demanded if additional expenditure on the part of the public took place. If, to take an extreme example, the whole of any increase in purchasing power in the hands of the public were to be spent on,, say, motor cars, and, if the motor-car industry were already fully employed, this increased purchasing power could not give rise to any increase in output and employment, but only to a redistribution of the benefits of the existing output between different sections of the community as a consequence of higher prices being paid for motor larger share would accrue to the producers of motor cars, and a smaller share to the producers of other goods and services. Ultimately,. of course, the comparative good fortune enjoyed by any particular industry or group of industries must lead to a diversion of labour and other resources from less into more profitable uses. But this is a process which can only be effected slowly. Thus, again only considering periods in which more fundamental readjustments cannot take place, it is possible for employment to be limited by the qualitative distribution of the surplus labour force, and by the available supplies of other factors necessary for the process of production.42. The unemployment which occurs at any rate as soon as a depression has gathered some degree of momentum is entirely atributable to absence of purchasing power. For the vicious circle of deflation which a depression sets in motion inevitably results in conditions in which normal capital development becomes exceedingly unprofitable; and, if the depression is world-wide in its incidence, this effect is likely to be reinforced by a falling off in the demand for exports. But conditions of under-employment may continue even after satisfactory financial conditions have been re-established for some time, and the absence of purchasing power is no longer obstructing the growth of employment. Unemployment of this character is attributable to the maladjust-ment of factors of production to demand.43. Now during the process of recovery from a prolonged and deep depression a stage must be reached when the absence of purchasing power gives way to the maladjustment of the factors of production as the factor principally responsible for the limitation of the rate at which employment may expand. The transition is naturally not abrupt. . In the first stages of recovery every industry is probably in a position to expand its output. Gradually in the more favoured industries, shortages begin to appear in particular classes of skilled labour, which though they may add somewhat to the costs of production, may be overcome by the employment of comparatively unskilled hands. Eventually a position is reached where rapid expansion is no longer possible in certain industries although in other ^industries a large surplus of labour still continues. This condition is likely to be reached all the sooner if the events which originally precipitated the
depression were of such a kind as eventually to call for a profound modification of the distribution of productive resources among different uses.44. An outstanding feature. of the crisis of the years 1929-33 was unfortunately the need for just such a fundamental readjustment. In the years 1927-29 this country was in the habit of investing  100 millions annually abroad. The events of the last few years have made it abundantly clear that this rate of investment cannot be sustained indefinitely : for in the last analysis its soundness depended on an indefinite expansion of the demand on the part of industrial Europe for foodstuffs and raw materials produced in the undeveloped countries of the remaining continents; and for reasons which we elaborated fully in our thirteenth report (paper no. E.A.C. (E.I.) 104), it is no longer possible to count on such an expansion. In future, though it may still be possible to find some profitable fields for investment abroad, we can no longer hope to achieve a favourable balance of payments of the size to which we were accustomed before the depression. Thus, one of the conditions of maintaining adequate purchasing power in this country since the depression has been the transference of demand from the export industries, which benefit from foreign investment, to the industries catering for home investment, and from investment industries generally to industries catering for home consumption. In a sense it may be said that the measures necessary to overcome the deficiency of purchasing power increased the degree of maladjustment of the factors of production in relation to demand. Although measures such as the establishment of low rates of interest and the promotion by the State of housing schemes, which were the principal constructive measures which it was within the power of the Government to take, had as their immediate effect an expansion in the level of incomes available for expenditure, they inevitably required, at the same time, a considerable redistribution of the factors of production as between their different uses.45. This analysis is of considerable importance in evaluating the present outlook for a continued recovery in this country. For the rate at which employ-ment can expand when the country is recovering from a deficiency of purchasing power alone is very much greater than that which is possible when further recovery also implies the transference of labour and other resources from declining industries to more prosperous industries. The experience of the years 1925-1929 shows for how long a time prosperous conditions in one group of industries may co-exist with considerable unemployment in other quarters. Over that period employment expanded, on the average, at the rate of only one per cent, per annum, whereas in 1933 and 1934 the rate of expansion was approximately four per cent, per annum. As soon as we have reached a point at which difficulties of transfer-ence begins to interfere materially with the expansion of employment, we must anticipate a very much slower rate of progress than has prevailed hitherto.46. It is impossible to express with confidence a precise view regarding the present importance of the problem of transference in limiting the rate of industrial progress. But it is clear, on the one hand, that we have by no means reached a position in which every increase in employment must be accompanied by an equal transfer of productive forces into new uses : and, on the other hand, that we are no longer in the position in which an increase in demand in every industry can be satisfied by the employment of labour and other resources already-attached to that industry. The evidence of the emergence of transfer difficulties is as yet only slight. But we must expect to see more definite indications of their importance as the year progresses. We shall expect, for example, to see wages and. prices rising in some industries, while in the majority of industries they remain at their present level; to see perhaps unduly high profits being earned in some directions while in other directions losses continue to be made; to hear from time to time of work being held up by shortages of skilled labour. Thus though we do not believe that so long as general conditions of confidence and financial liquidity remain unimpaired that the growth of employment this year will be as slow as in the prosperous years preceding the depression, we doubt whether it will be possible to maintain so fast a rate of progress as in the years 1933 and 1934.47. A consequence of such a change in the underlying economic situation is that in future much more importance will attach to the qualitative effect of any remedy proposed for improving employment than was the case at earlier[11610] e
stages in the process of recovery. As long as considerations of maintaining purchasing power, were of paramount importance any action which had the effect of promoting consumption at the expense of saving, or pf promoting investment in capital goods was bound to be of advantage. As the situation develops it will become more and more necessary to consider the impact of such action on the labour situation in particular industries and localities. A time must cqme when to increase the demand for labour in industries which are already having difficulty in attracting a sufficient labour force will even react adversely on the whole employment situation.48. In these circumstances particular importance attaches to the develop-ment of the deruand for exports. In the industries supplying this demand there is fp-(lay a large excess of labour and productive capacity. The prospects in these industries of absorbing into employment during the next few years&apos; a large prqportion of those at present out of work would be very much improved if world trade were to show a material revival; for an increased demand for labour from this direction would involve no problems of transfer. We have already indicated our view that while we may hope for a continued improvement of our trade within the sterling area, and perhaps an improvement with the United States, a more general recovery of our overseas trade is unlikely, so long as the gold countries of the Continent set themselves the task of defending their present parities. It may be, however, that the time when they will abandon this policy is very near; and it is important, therefore, that we should prepare our minds for the issues that will then arise and develop in advance an appropriate policy.49. In view of the likelihood that the gold countries will decide to abandon their present parities, the attitude of Great Britain towards the stabilisation of sterling has become a central issue, which must be viewed in a new perspective. On the one hand, it is important to avoid the danger of a renewed period of exchange confusion, accompanied perhaps by a rivalry in exchange depreciation, which might serve still further &quot;to demoralise international trading conditions and to prejudice the growth of pur trade within the sterling area. More positively, it is important to utilise the opportunity whjch will arise when the, gold ppuntries are prepared to devalue to secure exchange conditions which may facilitate a reduction of trade barriers and encourage a general revival pf international trade. On the other hand, it will remain vital to take no step which, for the sake of a problematical advantage in the international sphere, might imperil the continuance of the progress which we have succeeded in making in the past three years in our internal trade activity.50. In order to define the principles which should govern our attitude towards stabilisation, it is desirable to consider the nature of the advantages which we have derived in recent years from the fact that sterling has not been tied to gpld. The great advantage, in pur judgement, has lain in  he fact that it has been possible tp pursue,1 a policy of cheap mpney without interruption, or fear of interruption, over a period of several years. The beneficial effects of a low bank rate accrue only gradually, as cheap money works through from short-term rates to long-term rates, and&apos;from gilt-edged rates to other rates of interest; and in order that these effects should be realised, it is essential that the cheap money should be long sustained. Now there have been various periods during recent years when an increase iri bank! rates, accompanied by a tightening of the money market, would h^ve been unavoidable., if sterling had been-linked to gold. A^ various times, one&apos;of them during the present year, the movement of short-term balances away from London has assumed such dimensions that sterling has fallen materially&apos;relatively&apos; to the gold currencies; and at these tinies, if we had been under an obligation to maintain the gpld value of sterling at the parity then ruling, a rise in bank rate would have been inevitable. If, in fact, bank rate had been raised ph these occasions, it, is improbable, in our judgement, that we should have secured eithpr the lowering of lpjng.-te.5cm interest rates, or the Iprprpssive, recovery in &quot;internal trade which we h&apos;i&apos;ye experienced in recent years.51. There are unfortunately no sufficient grounds for assuming that large short-term capital movements would come to an end if the exchanges were effectively stabilised. Accordingly, any form of exchange, stabilisation which iinposed on us the! pbligation tp defend a given parity in &quot;case pf need by raising bank rate., independently of the needs of the! ihteraarsituatjqn, would entail a
very serious risk of a setback to internal trade. This is a risk which in our judgement it would be imprudent to run. Any contribution that we may make towards exchange stabilisation should, in our view be subject to the definite limitation that we can enter into no arrangement which might entail subordinating our internal credit policy to exchange requirements.52. Subject to this very important limitation, Great Britain should be ready, in our view, to co-operate in an attempt to secure stable exchanges. It would be essential, of course, that exchange levels should be chosen which bore a reasonable relation to the internal values of the respective currencies; but there would be no need to scrutinise these exchange-levels very jealously, or to reject an agreement which might in our judgement leave certain other currencies slightly under-valued in relation to sterling. It has often been suggested that a tentative gold parity might be fixed for sterling, which would be subject to alteration from time to time, in the same way that bank rate is subject to alteration. This might be welcomed by other countries as an indication of our desire to maintain exchange stability. We might further make it clear that we should not alter this parity, in order to improve the competitive position of our export industries, or in an attempt to raise the level of sterling prices, and that alterations would only be made in response to a movement of funds, which would otherwise require an alteration of bank rate.53. Great Britain should be prepared not merely to act upon these principles, but to give undertakings to do so. It would be an advantage if other important countries were prepared to give similar undertakings; and such undertakings might appropriately form the basis of an international agreement or understanding for currency stabilisation.54. We cannot say whether, in fact, events will so shape themselves that a general readjustment of currencies on a reasonable basis can be made the subject of international discussion, nor whether, if so, the condition which we have suggested to be essential for the protection of our economy would be an acceptable basis for discussion to the other countries concerned. It may well prove that political factors will make any agreed co-operative action in this matter impossible and that events must be allowed to take their course. We think it desirable, however, that the British Government should consider, these questions now, in order that they may be in a position to take advantage of any opportunity that may occur.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.
