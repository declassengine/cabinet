THE present tension between Italy and Ethiopia, which has its origin1 in long-standing enmity between the two countries, suddenly became acute on the 5th December last.   On that date a serious encounter took place at the wells ofh Walwal, in the undefined border zone between Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia, . the forces involved being Italian colonial troops and the Abyssinian levies who--: had lately been acting as escort to the Anglo-Ethiopian Boundary Commission 11 which some eight or nine days earlier had arrived in the vicinity to investigate ! watering and grazing areas to which nomadic British Somali  tribes  are -accustomed to migrate at certain periods of the year.   Heavy casualties having . been incurred on both sides, no time was lost by the Italian Government in i presenting in Addis Ababa a series of sensational demands for compensation/^ salutes to the flag, punishment of the guilty, and other somewhat humiliating -i forms of reparation.   The Ethiopian Government immediately countered by i offering to submit the whole dispute to arbitration and to abide by the result:: thereof.   This proposal having been rejected by Italy, the Ethiopian Govern-ment, towards the end of December, drew the attention of the League of Nations; to the situation wThich had. arisen.   As a result, it was possible during the , January session of the League Council for informal action to be taken which led to the Italian and Ethiopian representatives addressing letters to the Secretary- &quot;/ General stating that both parties were prepared to reach an amicable settlement .&apos; by means of direct negotiations conducted in the spirit of the Italo-Ethiopian / Treaty of Friendship of 1928.   In view of these assurances, the League Council.&apos; postponed consideration of the Ethiopian appeal until its next session in May. ; From the very beginning His Majesty&apos;s Government had represented both in.&apos;&apos; Rome and Addis Ababa the necessity (a) for an early demarcation of the disputed// frontier, and (b) for friendly liquidation of the crisis arising from the clash at.; Walwal.   And, throughout, we have lost no opportunity of urging upon both&apos; sides the importance of arriving at a detente but unhappily without good result! \2.   On the excuse that further frontier incidents had occurred, and that the r Emperor was not in control of his subordinate chieftains, the postponement of &apos; consideration by the League was closely followed by the mobilisation of two/; Italian divisions aggregating 30,000 men, and other forces, which have been::.&apos; despatched to Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. /The direct negotiations between! I the two parties in Addis Ababa led to no result and the relations between them ^ steadily deteriorated; and, finally, shortly before the Stresa Conference, Ethiopia-i formally appealed to the League of Nations under article 15 of the Covenant. The Italian Government replied that as both sides were committed to follow the procedure of conciliation prescribed by treaty, League action under article J5 was not called for.  Not content with these explanations, the Ethiopian Govern-/&apos; ment endeavoured to have the question included in the agenda of the special&apos;/ session of the Council which immediately followed the Stresa Conference.   For,; two reasons, however, their request was not granted, namely, because the Council/ took note of the assurances from both parties that they intended to give effect tpV/ the aforementioned conciliation procedure, and because the dispute already figures./ in the agenda for the May meeting.    The extent to which Italy counts on the&quot;&apos; League being induced to favour her designs may be judged from the following . incident : At the special session of the Council above referred to, I observed that&apos;/ while agreeing that the discussion of the dispute should not be taken up till the.&apos;. May meeting, it would be unfortunate if in the meantime no further progress.&apos;J[11579] , ,
were made with the conciliation procedure, and that it was to be hoped that at any rate all the conciliators would be appointed before the meeting in May. -No representative of any Great Power said a single word in support of this suggestion, and we have reason to know that the fact that the British represerita-tive made this modest effort to advance conciliation has roused resentment in Rome. Since that date Italo-Ethiopian tension has, unfortunately, increased, Italy having evinced no disposition whatsoever, notwithstanding friendly but emphatic pressure from this country, to appoint her representatives on the pro-posed Conciliation Commissicn, and having, in fact, given every indication that she intends to take full advantage of the many opportunities for procrastination furnished by the somewhat vague phraseology and elaborate machinery of the treaty. A further sign of what is in store is the decision of the Italian Government to mobilise additional forces for service in her East African dependencies. We now have the clearest indications from the Italian Government that they contemplate military operations on an extended scale against Abyssinia as soon as climatic conditions permit and Italian preparations are complete. As &quot;the rainy season is understood to end in September, it is probable that the advance will take place in that month or in October; there is a possibility of aerial action before that date.,,: 3. We may, therefore, take it that Italy is accumulating on the spot all the elements for an offensive. It seems probable that, at any rate in the first instance, the objectives will be limited to the occupation of the area extending between Somaliland and the foothills of the Abyssinian range and including: possibly the important centre of Harrar. \Ii Italy made herself master of this territory, which is undoubtedly Abyssinian, this would be a big step towards fulfilling her desire to unite her two colonies of Eritrea and Italian Somaliland in a single continuous area. And, so long as Italy confines her operations to the lower ground, I understand that the military difficulties she might encounter are much more limited than those that would arise if she attempted to invade the plateau of Ethiopia proper and advance towards Addis Ababa. The natives in the lowlands are not themselves purely Abyssinian and Italy probably calculates that the tribes in this area will not be moved to resist the Italian advance by their&apos; attachment to the Government at Addis Ababa.4. Meanwhile Italian military preparations are proceeding apace. ; According to the most recent information, Italian troops already or about to be i available in East Africa follows :  Italian Somaliland One division of white and one division of black troops.Eritrea One Army Corps (two divisions) of native, -and one division of white troops.  In addition, three or four &quot; blacksbirt &quot; battalions.,,Additional troops now being mobilised in Italy for service in East Africa ,consist of one division of white troops, two &quot;black shirt&quot; divisions, and four iindependent  &quot;black shirt&quot;  battalions.     (The black shirt  divisions  are new formations, composed of six battalions, together with normal divisional artillery and ancillary services.  They are made up of volunteers, the regular army supply-ing a number of staff and specialists.)  While it is impossible to give exact figures, the aggregate numerical strength of all the above formations is probably some-; where in the neighbourhood of 1.00,000 men.  In addition, substantial numbers of laircraft have been despatched overseas.5. It is in these conditions that we are rapidly approaching the session of .the League Council scheduled to begin on the 20th May. It may be expected that Abyssinia will press her claim for the immediate consideration of the dispute. Italy is likely to urge that this is not necessary, since the conciliation procedure is still being pursued! This attitude on the part of Italy, if it succeeds, would keep the question from coming before the Council definitely for a long time. On ffie other hand, if Abyssinia succeeds in inducing the Council to deal with the ;;dispute at the coming session, there are likely to.be polemics, as it may be an tic i-pated that Italy will take up the strongest attitude of opposition, and she may be supported, silently if not overtly, by other Great Powers and not opposed by ,rnosf, of the smaller ones-judging by the experience of April at Geneva.   The
S3first step in the procedure under article 15 is for the parties to the dispute to communicate to the Secretary-General statements of their case with all the relevant facts and papers. If Italy intends to resist an attempt by the Council to deal with the dispute under article 15, she may well refuse to take this step. But even assuming that the normal procedure is adopted and that a rapporteur is then appointed (and this would involve finding some member of the Council willing to act), there is no reason to think that anything effective would result, for it is quite certain that Italy no more intends to accept an adverse decision from the Council in this matter than Japan did in the case of Manchuria.6. In the light of the foregoing it will be clear that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are in this matter likely to be faced with an exceedingly difficult decision. If they support against Italy a practical application of League principles, their action is bound greatly to compromise Anglo-Italian relations and perhaps even to break the close association at present existing between France, Italy and the United Kingdom. Indeed, Italy&apos;s reaction, in Signor Mussolini&apos;s present mood, is incalculable; the possibility of Italy retorting by leaving the League must not be overlooked. In any event, the European situation would be most seriously affected, and it would, in fact, be hard to imagine a state of affairs which would be more welcome to Germany.On the other hand, if the United Kingdom acquiesce in what would be a misuse of the League machinery by acting in a manner acceptable to Italy, but certainly unjust towards Ethiopia, His Majesty&apos;s Government will undoubtedly lay themselves open to grave public criticism. Apart from the possibility indicated above, the League itself seems bound to lose, whatever happens; if it opposes Italian policy, it will be flouted by Italy, which has before it the example of Japan; if, however, the Ethiopian appeal is once again postponed on some unconvincing excuse for a period of months, while Italian military preparations are matured, further proof of the League&apos;s inability to afford justice to a small country will be provided. -7. Apart from injury to the League and to Anglo-Italian relations, there is a further, and most serious, respect in which Italian policy towards Ethiopia is likely to affect the situation in Europe. If Italy becomes seriously involved in a military adventure against Abyssinia, however rapid her initial success may be and however much she may desire to stop short of an attack upon the Ethiopian hinterland, the unrest created by an advance over admittedly Ethiopian territory in the lowlands will inevitably find expression in recurring frontier incidents, which in turn will stimulate Italian military ambitions towards further and more drastic action. Such a state of affairs could only mean that substantial Italian forces would be locked up in North-East Africa and Italy&apos;s strength in Europe correspondingly weakened. Moreover, Signor Mussolini&apos;s Ethiopian policy is exceedingly unpopular among the Italian people. Desertions among the troops mobilised for service in Eritrea and the Somaliland have been numerous, and discontent is likely to be spread by the many sick who are at present drifting back from the forces already sent out. It is not too much to say that, if Italy becomes committed to a campaign likely to impose a considerable strain upon her resources&apos;in blood and gold, the repercussions on the home front may be serious indeed.8. Supply of A rms to A abyssinia. Under the treaty, signed in Paris on the 21st August, 1930, between the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Ethiopia, the first three countries &quot; undertake to permit&quot; the transit to Ethiopia across their respective adjacent territories of arms and ammunition for the Emperor of Abyssinia provided that these are accompanied by the documents there specified. The treaty contains a preamble which states that one of its objects is to enable the Emperor &quot;to obtain all the arms and munitions necessary for the defence of his territories from external aggression and for the preservation of internal order therein.&quot; But under the last paragraph of article 9 of the treaty, France, Italy and ourselves are bound to refuse to authorise the transit if the attitude Or disturbed condition of Ethiopia constitutes a threat to peace or public order.&quot; Since the tension with Italy became acute, Ethiopia has been purchasing arms in continental countries and. possibly, in the United States, though details are lacking of the quantities obtained. It is known, however, that consignments have been imported via Jibuti and the railway to Addis Ababa, which passes through French territory. - Such importations naturally run counter to Italian
4interests, and on the 8th May the Foreign Office were semiofficially notified by the Italian Embassy that assurances had been received from Germany, Belgium and Czechoslovakia that in future exports of arms from those countries destined for Ethiopia would be prohibited. In the meantime, however, it is alleged by the J Italian Government that two German vessels carrying some 760 cases of arms and munitions are at present on the high seas, and that these cases may be landed at Port Sudan or Berbera, or both, to be forwarded to Abyssinia. Should this occur and the consignments be found to be covered by all the permits specified by the Ethiopia Arms Treaty, a difficult problem arises, since it is certain that the Italian Government will press us not to allow the arms to go forward, basing their arguments upon the above-mentioned provisions of the treaty which relates to the disturbed condition of Ethiopia constituting a threat to peace. Consultations are taking place between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government, with a view to ascertaining the line which the latter have followed in respect of arms entering through Jibuti.9. The Italian Embassy have also intimated to us informally that, in the event of hostilities breaking out, they will &apos;&apos; declare a blockade &apos;&apos; on Ethiopia, with the object of intercepting munitions on their way to Ethiopia via the Red Sea ports. Technically, the idea of a &quot; blockade &quot; on a country which possesses no sea coast presents difficulties from the point of view of international law; but in point of fact it would not be necessary for the Italians to take such a step, since they would be entitled, under the doctrine of continuous voyage, to seize as contraband munitions of war which were on their way to Ethiopia via the ports in question. In making this observation I have assumed that the ordinary rules of belligerency and neutrality would apply, and have left out of account the consideration which would arise under the Covenant in the event of its being held that Italy had resorted to war in violation of her obligations under that instrument.10. The action of His Majesty&apos;s Government to avert this accumulation of dangers has been as follows : As already said at the end of the first paragraph, no opportunity has been lost of impressing upon both sides the necessity of an amicable settlement. In addition to urging the Italian Government to take a more conciliatory line, the attention of the Ethiopian Government has on more than one occasion been drawn to the reality of the menace with which they are confronted, in the hope that the Emperor would be able to exercise such control over his subordinate chieftains and advisers as to avoid the occurrence of any incidents on the frontier or other provocative action which might be used as a emus belli. During recent weeks, as the deterioration of the situation has become more and more marked, everything possible has been done by myself and the Permanent Under-Secretary and by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome to convince Italy of the dangers of her present policy. As recently as on the 3rd May I spoke most frankly to the Italian Ambassador in London (see despatch No. 548 to Rome of that date), warning him not only of the harmful effect Italy&apos;s. becoming entangled in Abyssinia would exert upon the European question, but also of the grave danger to Anglo-Italian relations of the very strong views undoubtedly held, and certain to be expressed, by British public opinion should Italy embark on an attack against Ethiopia. There is, unfortunately, no reason to suppose that this friendly representation on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment has exerted any calming effect in Rome,11. During the present week, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris has been instructed to discuss the whole question urgently with the French Government, and to suggest that they should join with His Majesty&apos;s Government in a final endeavour in Rome to prevent a crisis. In putting this proposal before the French Government, Sir George Clerk was also instructed to indicate that we would be disposed, in conjunction with the French, to recommend the Abyssinian Government to follow a policy more in accordance with modern conditions by recognising Italy&apos;s claims to taking fuller part in increasing the trade between Abyssinia and the outside world and in assisting the development of the economic resources of the Abyssinian Empire. At the same time, as indicated in paragraph 8, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris has been instructed to discuss-with the French Government the problem arising from the attempts of the Italian Government to prevent the supply of arms to Ethiopia. ,      .May 11, 1935.
