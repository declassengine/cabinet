1.      It will be recalled that after the insurance against third party risks by motor car owners had been made compulsory^ it was found necessary to pass the Assurance Companies (Winding-Up) Act, 1933,  in order to give the Board of Trade power to apply to the Court for leave to present a petition for the winding-up of an assurance company on the ground that it was unable to pay its debts.      Action has been taken under the provisions of this Act and certain Companies have been wound up. But the experience of the last two years has shown that the law as it stands does not permit action to be taken by the Board of Tra.de at a sufficiently early date with the result that insolvent companies are able to continue to do business and to increase their liabilities.S.      For the purpose of placing the Board of Trade in a position to apply to the Court for a winding-up Order,  the present Act empowers the Board to require a Company to furnish information for the purpose of determining whether it is,  or was at a given date,  insolvent, but this power can only be exercised (in the words of the Section)  &quot;if it appears to the Board that there is reasonable ground for believing that an assurance company is insolvent&quot;.3.      In this connection I am advised that suspicion,  even strong suspicion,  is insufficient and that evidence of insolvency is necessary before the Department can require the information specified in the Section.      This condition has seriously delayed the intervention of the Board of Trade in the case of those insurance companies which have been wound up under the Act and in regard to which there had been for some time-1-ijjIS DOCuMENT^IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.IgBTI COPY NO?x___p..j-ji5jl35).

strong suspicion,  though no definite evidence,  of insolvency. The material upon which the Department has to work consists primarily of the annual accounts which every insurance company is under a statutory liability to submit to  the Board, The Companies are, however, allowed a period of six months after  the end of their business year in which to deposit these accounts and meantime there may he many complaints from policy holders of refusals to pay claims or of delays in payment as well as the usual market rumours and the supply of unsolicited information to  the Department by interested parties.      But although the Department takes what steps it can,  it cannot act under Statute until evidence of insolvency has been obtained and that may take many weeks or months.4.    The   simplest&apos;, end most effective way of improving the position at once would be to confer on the Board of Trade power to call for information at any time (and not only when there is positive evidence of insolvency)  and,  if necessary, to require a company to allow its affairs to be investigated by an inspector appointed by the Board for the purpose of determining whether that company is or is likely to become insolvent.      If the company refuse to allow the Inspector to make an investigation the Board would be empowered to apply to the Court for an Order on the company to comply with the requirement,  in which event the company would be entitled to resist the making of the order on the ground that the requirement was unreasonable.5.    I propose that the new Bill should have the same scope as the 1933 Act.      It would therefore extend to all forms of insurance,  as well as motor car insurance,  which are at present supervised by the Board of Trade under general insurance legislation.
.6.    I do not claim that the proposals now submitted willcure all the possible evils of the insurance world.    Theywill not,  for example, prevent the promotion of speculative .concerns and will not,  of course,contain various reformswhich have received support in many quarters.    They will,however, enable the Board of Trade to investigate the affairs of doubtful companies without delay,  and in this way to preventthe latter from prolonging their existence to the detriment of their creditors.      The Insurance Companies whom I have consulted confidentially agree that in the present circumstances the proposals now put forward are probably the best.    Theyhave made it clear, however,  that in acquiescing in the proposed bill they are not giving up their demands for more comprehensiveproposals dealing with insurance as a whole and not merelywith the present problem.    These proposals,  if they were acceptable, could only find a place in a comprehensiveInsurance Undertakings Bill which would be lengthy and tosome extent contentious.7. So far as I can judge it is unlikely that any insurancecompany of appreciable importance will be in difficultiesin the near future,  although the position of one or two minorconcerns is doubtful.    But whether a company is large or smallits failure serves to advertise  the defects of the existing arrangements.      In view of the feeling on all sides of theHouse that the present position of the powers of the Board ofTrade is unsatisfactory,  I hope that the Cabinet will agreethat the Bill should be passed into law as rapidly  as possible,and in any event before the Summer Recess.      It would be suitable for introduction in the House of Lords,  in accordancewith the precedent of the 1933 Bill,  if desired.8.    I accordingly ask authority for the preparation ofa Bill to amend the Assurance Companies (Winding-up) Act, 1933,on the lines proposed in this memorandum and for the submission of the Bill to the Home Affairs Committee as soon as it isdrafted.3orrd of Trade, 7th June,  1935.
