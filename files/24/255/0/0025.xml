-HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)RET.COPY NO.C A B I IT E T.DEFENCE (AIR FORCE BARRACKS) BILL.Note by the Secretary of State, for air the decision for the immediate and rapid expansion of the Royal Air Force, with the need for a considerable number of new aerodromes which it involves, makes it essential that powers for the speedy acquisition of land should be available to the Air Ministry.The existing powers depend on 19th-century Army enactments  (applied to the Royal Air Force by Order in Council under the Air Force (Constitution) Act, 1917) and are not suitable for the purpose as they stand.      The procedure under the Military Lands Act, 1892, is protracted and involves the passage of a Provisional Order Bill through Parliament in each case.      The Defence Act, 1842,  affords satisfactory powers except for the proviso to section 19, which precludes the erection of barracks on the land acquired.      This restriction would, the Law Officers have advised, also apply if recourse were had to section 7 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Acts Amendment Act, 1860.My colleagues will appreciate that the restriction referred to is necessarily unacceptable to the Air Ministry, since it would preclude the erection of quarters for officers and men.      There are no other powers of compulsory acquisition available to the Department, and I find therefore that I have no alternative but to propose the introduction of a short Bill.A draft of the Bill, which has been prepared by Parliamentary Counsel,  is attached,  and it will be  seen that it
I.AIR MINISTRY,24th May,  1935.is a one-clause measure designed simply to remove the restriction in question, when the powers of the Defence Act, 1842, are used by the Presiderit of the Air Council for the acquisition of land for Air Force purposes,I recommend the Bill to the Cabinet for approval, and for authority to introduce it at a Yery early date,      It is necessary that land for the new aerodromes should be obtained with the least possible delay and I hope that it will be practicable to arrange for the Bill to become law in the next few weeks.
