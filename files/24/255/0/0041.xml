215og HIS britannic majesty&apos;s government.CABINET. ^SECRET. france^M-MCP.126(35).TEACHERS    SUPERANNUATION - PROPOSED BILL. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Education.In accordance with the National Economy (Education) Order, 1931, the salaries of teachers in grant-aided schools were cut by 10$ from October 1st, 1931? to June 30th, 193U, the cut being reduced to 5% in respect of the period from July 1st, 193k, to June 30th, 1935.Inasmuch as teachersf pensions are calculated on the average salaries received by them during the last 5 years of service, the effect of the cuts on their pensions is to reduce by sums varying from an infinitesimal percentage up to thepensions receivable by teachers retiring within a period from the first application of the cuts to a date 5 years after their removal,It was represented by the Teachers&apos; Associations, and frequently mentioned in the House of Commons on their behalf, that this constituted a special hardship, inasmuch as, though the salary cuts were stated to be intended to meet a temporary emergency, the teachers retiring within the affected period would not only suffer a temporary reduction in salary, but a loss in pension which would last for the rest of their liveseThe desirability of meeting this difficulty was discussed by my predecessor with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and in July, 193k 9 it was stated in the House of Commons that the Government would consider the initiation of legislation to ensure that the pensions of teachers should not be affeoted by the operation of the temporary cuts in teachers&apos;
216salaries, on the footing that both the employees and teacher&apos;s contributions in respect of each individual teacher in service during any part of the period of the currency of the cuts should be revised and paid on the basis of uncut salaries during the whole.period of such employments     Accordingly, since contri-butions have been calculated on the basis of cut salaries since the cuts were first imposed on October 1st, 1931, this would have entailed the collection by the Board of retrospective additional contributions from the teachers and their employers^After prolonged examination, various difficulties were found to attend this proposal, and there appeared to be ground for thinking that the teachers would prefer a solution which would not involve a collection of back contributions either from themselves or from the Local Education Authorities even though the result might not be so favourable to the teachers affected,Ultimately, with the consent of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, an agreement was reached with the teachers1 representatives, the terms of which were announced in the following Answer to a Question in the House of Commons on May 27th, 1935:-&quot;I am glad to be able to announce that my Noble Friend has informed the teachers&apos; representatives that the Government is prepared to initiate legislation to secure that as from 1st July, 1935, no teachers affected by the salary cuts shall suffer any reduction in their annual superannuation allowances exceeding 2 per cent, the present position with regard to other allowances, eBg. lump sums and death gratuities, remaining unaffected. The cost of this proposal will be borne by the Exchequer. I may add that the offer has been accepted by all the teachers&apos; associations represented on the Burnham Committee as an agreed and final solution of the matter.&quot;
217The Scottish Education Department have agreed with the Scottish teachers to adopt the same arrangement,,It is estimated that the present capitalised cost to the Exchequer of this proposal1is ahout one million pounds, a sum which is approximately equal to the additional net cost which would have fallen on the Exchequer in respect of pensions had there been no salary cuts,,      The annual cost will be of the order of  27*000 in 1935-36, rising to  85,000 in 1939-M9 and declining thereafterI ask for the sanction of my colleagues to the introduction of legislation implementing this arrangement,OoPoGoS,21st June, 1935*3o
