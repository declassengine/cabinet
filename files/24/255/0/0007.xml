THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. Copy No.C A B I N E T.CP.  92  (35)RATIFICATION OP CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONVENTIONS.Joint Memorandum Toy the Home Secretary and the Minister of Labour.       _We desire to recommend to our colleagues the approval of certain proposals with a view to the ratification of three Draft International Labour Conventions which were adopted by the International Labour Conference at its 18th Session last June.(1) Draft Convention (No.41)  concerning employment of women during the night (revised 1954) .The International Labour Conference at its Pirst Session at Washington in 1919 adopted a Convention which prohibited the employment of women in industrial undertakings at night (i.e. during 11 consecutive hours,  including the period between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.).      Our law was brought into conformity with this Convention by the Employment of Women,  Young Persons and Children Act,  1920, and the Convention was ratified by Great Britain in 1921.Representations were subsequently received that the Convention could not be observed without hardship in the case of women holding responsible positions such as manageresses, electrical engineers, etc.;    and at the International Labour Conference in 1931 it was proposed, on the initiative of the British Government, that the 1919 Convention, which, we interpreted as applying to such women, should be revised so as to exempt them.      The correctness of the British interpretation was questioned in some quarters, but was confirmed by the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1932; and last June the International Labour Conference adopted by 120 votes to one - that of Miss Julia. Varley, the British workers1 representative - a revised Convention containing an exemption for
&quot;women holding responsible positions of management and not ordinarily engaged in manual -work&quot;.      The British Government delegates had been instructed (see CP.  147 (34))  to use every effort to get this exemption carried,In other respects the new Convention is substantially the same as the old,  save that it enables the  competent national authority, in certain circumstances and after consultation with the employers&apos;  and workers&apos;   organisations concerned,   to substitute 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. as the prohibited period of employment, instead of 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.  for a particular industry or area.      This amendment, which was initiated by Belgium, is not at present wanted in this country but might prove useful in the future in view of changing social habits or other developments.. The present position is accordingly that there exist two International Labour Conventions, the one adopted by the Conference in 1919 and ratified by this country and the revised Convention adopted last year.      There is also an older Convention adopted at Berne in 1906 and ratified by this country which has the same effect as the 1919 Convention.      In order to put our position right vis-a-vis international law we should,  if ratifying the 1934 Convention,  denounce the 1919 Convention and the Berne Convention .It would also be desirable, before actually ratifying,  to pass legislation to remove the bar on the night employment of the women who are excluded from the revised Convention.     Such employment is at present prohibited by the 1920 Act above mentioned and is indirectly&apos;precluded by the hours provisions of the factory Acts;    and the Bill should therefore modify the 1920 Act and exempt from the hours provisions of the factory Acts women (over 18)  holding responsible positions of management and not ordinarily engaged in manual work.      The Bill should also
contain a provision for its coming into fdree on a later date to tie fixed by Order,  so as to prevent it operating until the denunciations of the  old Conventions have become effective and the new one is ratified.     As regards the 11 p.m. to 6 a.m-modification in the new Convention,  it is not thought necessary or desirable to include in the Bill any provision on this point.      Vnder the Factory Acts women may not be employed (save in certain cases which are also excepted- from the Convention) after 10 p.m. and no need has so far arisen for any extension.We do not anticipate that such a Bill should be controversial.     Although, as above mentioned,  the British Workers&apos;  representative voted against the new Convention at, Geneva,  it is believed that other British Workers there did not. share her decided view;    it was the Labour Government in 1931 that initiated the revised Convention;    and in any case the Labour Party would seem on general grounds unlikely to oppose ratification of an International Labour Convention, more especially one adopted by such an overwhelming majority. Further,  the Factories Bill introduced by Mr. Henderson in 1924 and by Members  of the Labour Party in 1926 and 1927 all contained a clause exempting from the general hours provisions persons holding responsible positions of management and not usually employed in manual labour .We suggest that we should now be authorised to state that H.M. Government propose to ratify the new Convention as soon as the necessary legislation can be obtained.      Questions have already been raised as to whether we propose  to ratify it with reasonable promptitude and we should in any case be expected, having regard to our obligations under Article 405 of the Versailles Treaty,   to reach a decision as to our intentions before  the end of next June.      It would be desirable.,  though not essential, that the legislation referred to should be passed this Session,  and we propose that the Bill should be
drafted now so as to &quot;be ready for introduction at short notice (subject of course to Cabinet approval)  if circumstances permit.The Government of Northern Ireland have been consulted and acquiesce in the view that the revised Convention should be adopted .(2) Draft Convention (No.43) for the regulation of hours of work in automatic sheet glass works^.The broad effect of this Convention, which was adopted by the International Labour Conference last June,  is to provide that where persons are employed in successive shifts in certain necessarily continuous operations in sheet glass works,   they are to be employed under a system of at least 4 chifts,  so arranged that their hours of work shall not exceed 42 per week when averaged over a period not exceeding 4 weeks.The British Government Delegates supported the Convention at Geneva in accordance with their instructions as approved by the Cabinet on the 6th June.      As reported to the Cabinet (CP .147(34)) the National Confederation of Employers1 Organisations had urged that a Convention on this subject should be opposed on the general ground that they objected to Conventions to regulate hours internationally;    but the Government felt that they could not adopt this non-possumus attitude.      Messrs. Pilkington,   the only manufacturers in this country directly concerned, had adopted the four-shift system and were known to be  supporters of a Convention as a step in the direction of securing that those of their foreign competitors who have not already done so should adopt  this system.      More-over,  the policy of securing shorter hours in particular industries where this  is practicable was  (and is) in conformity with that adopted by the Government in connection with the proposals for a 40 hour week generally.It was intimated at Geneva that ratification by H.M. Government must not be assumed irrespective  of the extent of
ratification by the countries in which sheei glass is chiefly produced;    and no ihformaiibh has so far Reached us as to what action those countries are taking in the matter;     We think, however,  that it might be helpful in connection with the Government negotiations with employers&apos; and workers&apos; representatives, and generally in dealing with Geneva proposals as to reduction of working hours,  if it could now be announced that H.M.  Government definitely propose to ratify this Convention. Such an announcement would,  it is suggested,  be useful as an indication that the Government is not adopting an obstructive attitude in relation to Geneva Conventions for the reduction of hours,  though unable to accept the proposition that there should be a general Convention for shorter working hours in all industries.It has been ascertained that Messrs. Pilkington have no objection to ratification of the Convention even though ratification does not take place in competitive countries. The Glass Manufacturers&apos; federation have also been consulted but feel that they should not express an opinion on a matter affecting a section of the industry with which they have no direct concern, Messrs. Pilkington not being members of the Federation.      The Northern Ireland Government state that they are not concerned and have no objection to ratification.Before we could actually ratify,  legislation would be necessary to make the system of hours compulsory.     We do not anticipate that such legislation should give rise to any Parliamentary difficulty if, as we contemplate,  the Bill is drafted in the form of a Bill to give effect to the Convention (which would be set out in a Schedule),  so as to exclude questions of hours in other sections of the glass industry or in other industries,  and if it is treated as a Home Office Bill dealing with a matter of factory regulation.      The Convention was
adopted at Geneva not in connection with, the recent discussions on hours of work, hut as a result of discussions dating &quot;back a number of years as to methods of providing adequate rest for workers engaged in a hot process in which cessation of work on Sundays is impracticable;    and the matter has throughout been dealt with at Geneva by representatives of the Home Office .      It is contemplated that the Act should be enforced by the factory Inspectors though it will not be necessary, or perhaps desirable, that it should form part of the factory Acts.We suggest that the legislation should be drafted now,  so as to be ready for introduction at short notice (subject of course to Cabinet approval) and should be combined in one Bill with the legislation to give effect to the Convention as to employment of women at night (see above) .(3) Draft Convention (No.42) concerning Workmen&apos;s Compensation for occupational diseases  (revised 1934) .   &quot;In 1925 the International Labour Conference, adopted a Convention, which has been ratified by this country, under which ratifying States undertake to provide that Workmen&apos;s Compensation shall be payable in respect of certain occupational diseases (indicated in a Schedule) in accordance with the general principles of the national legislation relating to compensation for industrial accidents.      The diseases scheduled in the Convention were lead poisoning, mercury poisoning and anthrax.It was contemplated that the Schedule of diseases should be extended later on, and this was done last year in a revised Convention which is substantially in the same terms as the earlier one but adds a number of diseases,  the most important of which is silicosis .The list still does not include all those in respect of which compensation is given in this country, but the Convention is a
We recommend that the following proposals be approved: -(a) We should be authorised to state that H.M. Government proposeto ratify the revised Convention as to Night Employment of Women and the Glass Works Convention as soon as the necessary legislation can be obtained.(b) Parliamentary Counsel should draft a Bill for the purposeof giving effect to the two Conventions above mentioned.(c) The revised Occupational Diseases Convention should be ratified.J .G. 0.S .3rd May, 1935 .distinct advance in the direction of procuring compensation in other countries for silicosis and other diseases for which compensation is given here, and it is suggested that the British Government should proceed forthwith to ratify the Convention.     This country is recognised as being one of the pioneers in the matter of compensation for industrial diseases, and delay on our part might be taken by some other countries as an excuse for doing nothing.     The Home Office is advised that no amendment of Our law is necessitated.The Government of Northern Ireland concur in the proposal to ratify.
