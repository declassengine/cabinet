CONFIDENTIAL.A.Ce026.BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL. STATE OF TRADE - MAY,   1955.Summary of reports submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS TRADE.      Imports in May at  64.5 i. were  2.7 m. higher than in May,  1934,  imports of raw materials  increasing by  1.5 m. and of articles wholly or mainly manufactured by  0.9 i,    Exports of United Kingdom produce and manufactures were  35.2 m.  or  2.4 m. more than a year ago.    The rise was largely due to increased exports of manufactured goods. Re-exports amounted to  5.6 m.  as compared with  4.8m.  a year earlier.EMPLOYMENT.      The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges at 20th May was 2,0441,752, an increase of 292 as compared with a month earlier.The main variations were:-London ......  ^       813South Eastern -   5,830 South Western -   2,179 Midlands .... *    7,507North Eastern 4- 14,757 North Western *       813 Scotland ....  - 10,115Wales .......  -    3,84 8The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-64 In employment at 20th May was 10,334,000.    This was 14,000 more than a month earlier and 141,000 more than a year ago.An improvement in employment was recorded in building, public works  contracting,  general engineering,  the cotton, hosiery and tailoring industries,  some of the food manufacturing industries and the distributive trades.    There was, however,  a large increase in the numbers temporarily  .
stopped, in the coal mining industry,  and there was some decline in employment.in motor vehicle building,   steel melting,  rolling,   etc.,  the linen industry,  textile bleaching dyeing and finishing.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.    During the five weeks ended 2nd June railway traffic receipts increased by  151,000 (1.09$) aa compared with the corresponding period of 1934.    There were increases of 7,4fa and 3.5$ respectively in the receipts from fuel and other merchandise while passenger traffic fell by 3.4f0;    but in connexion with this comparison it must he remembered that Whitsuntide fell within this period in 1934 but not in 1935.      The total receipts for the 22 weeks ended 2nd June amounted to  59.7 m.  against  59.8 m.  for the same period in 1934.SHIPPING.      The index number for shipping freights (1913 - 100) was 76.62 in May as against 77.61 in April and 76.4 5 twelve months ago.    The laid up tonnage at ports in Great Britain and Ireland amounted to 706,000 net tons on April 1st as against 878,000 tons on January 1st     and 1,080,000 tons a year ago.BANKING.      Money remained plentiful at       during the month.    The average tender rate for Treasury bills rose from about 10/- to lO/6d.    In the foreign exchange market there was some nervousness regarding the dollar which weakene from 4.82 on the 1st May to 4.92 at the end of the month. This uncertainty caused renewed weakness in the gold currencies which was further aggravated by the unsatisfactory state of the French Budget.    Gold continued to leave the gold countries on a substantial scale and betweer the 23rd May and the end of the month the French bank rate vras raised by stages from 2ls% to g%,    This led to some improvement in the spot rate for francs hut forward francs still remain at a considerable
discount.      The price of gold continued to show a premium over the franc.      In the silver market the price fell during the early part of May to 32-g-d.  as compared with the peak price of 36^d.   towards the end of April.      Renewed buying by speculators and by the Indian Bazaars then forced the price up to 35fd. but the nervousness caused by the decision of the American Supreme Court with regard to the National Recovery Act brought the price baok to SS^/lSd. at the end of the month.COAL.    The average weekly output for the quarter ended 25th May was   4.35 m.  tons as compared with 4.51 m.  tons in the corresponding period of 1934, a decrease of 3.43^. The average number of persons employed during this period was 767,500 as against 786,900 a year ago.      The internal consumption of coal, coke, eto.  in April, 1935, was 13.7 m. tons as compared with 14.0 m.  tons in April, 1934. Exports in May,  1935, were 3.67 m.  tons as against 3.65 m. tons in May.last year.      Exports in May to the Irish Free State, Gibraltar, Prance and Egypt showed increases over last year, but there was a decrease in exports to Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium and South American countries. There was little change in the position as regards Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Italy.IRON AND STEEL.    The improvement recorded in the iron and steel markets early in the month was well maintained and has spread to most departments of the industry.,      The improvement is almost entirely on home account,   there being very little new export business.      The increase in orders for pig iron though appreciable was hardly up to expecba+ions in view of the greater activity in the industry.    In the semi-finished steel market forward. bookings increased and
there was a scarcity of &quot;Continental steel,  although old contracts accounted for a limited volume of imports.      Tne diversion of Continental business ensured a good home demand for finished steel.On the North East Coast considerable improvement was experienced in semi-finished steel as a result of the arrangements with the Cartel and it is claimed that production in the area is at present proceeding at the rate of over 2 million tons per year.      Shipbuilding demand is unsatisfactory, but orders for railway material are in good volume.In Sheffield the general position was satisfactory. Orders for railway material and aircraft steel were good and the demand for high speed and special steels also improved.In Scotland apprehension is still felt at the lack of fresh shipbuilding orders and as the demand for heavier shipbuilding material has now been practically exhausted requirements in the near future will be for the lighter types.      The general engineering trade continued to he well employed, but the demand for structural material has fallen off.      Tube works are running more regularly.In South Wales the demand for structural steel, billets and tinplate bars was good.      The market for tinplates improved but galvanised sheets continued to suffer from a lack of export business.MOTOR INDUSTRY.    The number of motor cars newly registered in April was 33,040 or 7,349 more than a year ago;    the increase comprised 6,080 private cars and 1,269 other vehicles.      Dor the first quarter of the year sales of private cars show an increase in numbers of 34.9$ in the 7-11 h.p. class and 73.5$ in the 17 h.p.   and over class, while there was a decrease of 11.7$ in the case of the 12-16 h.p. class as compared with the corresponding period of last year,
Imports of complete cars from the United States of America and Canada (all of 17 h.p. and over)  in the first quarter of 1935 numbered 3,602 as against 1,240 last year.Exports of new private cars (including cabs)  in May amounted to 3,559 valued at  432,400 as against 2,465 valued at  350,300 a year ago.LIGHT METAL INDUSTRIES.    Non-ferrous metal mills remain well employed, particularly in the production of light alloys for aircraft.     The values of base metals have continued to rise.     Active conditions prevail in the press work,  foundry, tool, and lock and allied trades.      Business in cutlery and plate remains steady, although in the cheaper lines prices show little,  if any, profit.      The hollow-ware industry is progressing satisfactorily, but there is some seasonal slackening in demand in the needle industry.   Architectural metalwork still remains very poor.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.Since the beginning of the year the greater activity in nearly all industries, especially building, has been reflected in an increased demand for both heavy and light material.     in the case of the former the demand for plant, especially industrial motors and control gear, has improved considerably and a number of orders for electrical equipment for the modernisation of rolling mills have been placed recently.     The principal manufacturers of electric traction equipment have reached a voluntary agreement to pool all their patents and designs in order to give the railway companies the advantages of interchangeability in connection with the new plans for the electrification of the railways.
Exports of electrical machinery are satisfactory and there are signs that the market in foreign countries is improving, particularly in South America and China.As regards light material,  the output of electric lamps has increased by 12.6% for the ten months ended April,  as compared with a year earlier.    The production of rubber cable increased by 21.0$ and of telephone cable by 85$ in 1954 as compared with 1933.COTTON. The employment position improved both in the spinning and in the weaving sections in May.    Average weekly deliveries of rSw cotton to spinners were below those of April, but this may have been due to a decrease in mill stocks. Takings of Indian cotton declined.      The prices of most of the main types of cotton showed little change.    It is probable that the margins of many spinners were reduced during the month.Exports of cotton yarn and manufactures in May amounted to 4.97m. against 4.71m. in April and 4.76m.  in May, 1934.    Exports of grey yarn-a increased and,  as compared with April,  there were larger shipments to India, Australia, Germany, Belgium and Brazil, hut declines in exports to Norway, Japan and Argentina. Exports of piece goods showed little change as compared with April.    There was a decrease in exports to India as compared with April and shipments to British West Africa showed a considerable reduction.    There was an improvement, however, in the trade with South Africa, Malaya, Australia and New Zealand.    Among European markets trade with Norway and Switzerland fell off, but exports to Germany, Holland and Denmark showed an increase.    In Central and South America there was a marked expansion in business with Colombia and Argentina.      As compared with May last year the principal features were increased shipments to most British countries - India and British
West Africa in particular - and smaller exports to Australia, Scandinaviao Switzerland, Egypt, Cuba and Argentina.      The unsatisfactory position of the Australian trade appears to be mainly due to the competition of Japanese cotton and rayon goods.WOOL.      The slight improvement in the general activity of the industry recorded in April was maintained in May and was fairly evenly distributed throughout the various sectionsand districts.      The export trade in May - a month in which for-seasonal reasons an upward trend is normally to be expected -was disappointing and there was a further decrease in exportsIof tops and tissues and only a slight increase in yarns.      There was a definite upward movement in ra.w wool prices during the month.      Reports indicate that new orders on home and export account are insufficient to maintain the present activity of the mills and that a quieter period is anticipated. SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.      There has been a slight improvement in the demand for yarns by the weaving and underwear trades, but there is little change so far as the hosiery trade is concerned.      Exports of yarn during May showed a decrease on May of last year, but for the first five months exports are well in advance of those for the same period in 1934,      The trade in rayon piece goods has suffered considerably owing to weather conditions during May and it is feared that there is now little prospect of any appreciable profit being made on the sale of summer fabrics;      It is hoped that Autumn business will show improvement.      Sales in Dominion and Colonial markets are rather less than last year and complaints are being received of intensive competition from Japan,
There has heen some increase in the prices of Italian raw silk, hut there has teen little change in that of Canton and Japan,      Imports of silk piece goods from Japan are stated to he affecting the general position of good class rayon and silk productions in this market,CHEMICALS.     Alkali deliveries in the home market showed considerable improvement over previous months and exports for the first five months of this&apos; year are higher than last year. Sales of chlorine products and of acids were satisfactorily maintained.      The home demand for dyestuffs improved and more than compensated for a. slight fall in export sales.      Creosote oil and wood tar have been in good demand and the market in most other coal tar products and also in wood distillation products has been steady.POTTERY.      In general the activity noted in April continued throughout May.    The demand for general earthenware is satisfactory and china ware prospects are excellent.      The improved demand for sanitary ware is expected to continue, while trade in electric ware is better than a year ago.      The increase in exports has been maintained, except in the sanitary earthenware section.LEATHER.      There has been a general tendency for hide values to increase.      The leather consuming trades have been moderately active in May, the boot and shoe industry in particular showing a welcome improvement.      The demand for sole leather was very good and was active in upper leather, though British producers of calf uppers were affected by imports from Germany.      The demand for equipment leathers in some countries has led to a substantial rise in the price of certain classes of hides.      Business in upholstery leather was steady and in sheepskin and light leather showed some improvement. -   There was some improvement in exports to the Empire - particularly to the Irish Free State - but
this must he read, in conjunction with the establishment of boot and shoe factories there to make boots formerly imported from this country.PAPER.      Generally speaking the demand for paper and boards was well maintained during May and mills were rather busier than for several years past,      Strong competition is, however, still being felt from overseas suppliers and in particular there were heavy shipments of newsprint during the month from Canada.      Exports showed no change in the aggregate compared with a year a.go, but there was a distinct improvement in the fine paper section, especially to Empire countries. RETAIL TRADE.      The money value of retail sales in April was 10, 3% greater than in April 1934.      It must be remembered, however, that the s timulus of Easter occurred in April this year.      Nevertheless this is the largest Increase recorded since the figures were first compiled,      The principal increases were in boots and shoes (21e9%)9 women&apos;s wear (15.3%), sports and travel (14.4%) and men&apos;s and boys1 wear (13*8%).      Only piece goods showed a decline.-.     Every area showed an increase in sales both in food, and non-food departments, the largest increase being recorded in the London suburbs.CO-OPERATIVE TRADE.      The Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s sales for the four weeks ended 11th May shewed an increase of 1*8% over a year ago.      The weighted average of the wholesale prices of seven of the principal commodities showed an increase of 4.73% as compared with last year and the weighted average of the retail prices of the same commodities has increased by 2,82%.EMPIRE TRADE.CANADIAN TRADE.      The index of business operations in April showed a gain of nearly 6% over March,  and the index of wholesale prices rose from 72.0 to 72.5.
Exports of copper fell from the high level of the preceding month out exports of nickel, which usually record a seasonal decline,  increased by over 2 million lbs. and reached a record level.    Among manufacturing industries sugar, meat packing, newsprint and steel were outstanding. The output of sugar amounted to 49 million lbs. as against 24 million lbs.  in the preceding four week period.    The meat packing index advanced from 124.3 to 135.5.    The export of lumber at 63.8 million feat as against 100 million feet showed a decline slightly greater than is normal for the season.    The output of the newsprint industry was S22,000 tons as compared with 206,000 tons in March.      After seasonal adjustments marked gains were reported in the indices of imports and exports.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.    2,723,000 bales of wool have been received into store    from July 1st to the end. of April as compared with 2,568,000 a year ago.    Of these 2,375,000 have been sold or exported as against 2,407,000 last season.    &quot;Wheat and flour shipments for the period 1st December to the end of May are equivalent to 60.1 m. bushels of wheat as against 46.5 m. bushels for the same period last year.    Exports of butter for the season now amount to 113,000 tons as against 99,900 tons last year.    Total imports of merchandise in Maywere  6.9 rn.  (Australian currency), as against  6.2 m, a year ago.SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.  The expansion in the gold mining industry continues to have beneficial effects upon other industries in the country.    Manufacturing industries continue to expand and in most sections factories are fully employed. During March imports exceeded exports by nearly  750,000 the low figure of exports being due again to the reserve bank retaining an abnormally large portion of the month&apos;s gold output.
207The farming prospects are good.    The latest estimate of the maize crop is 17.9 m. hags.    With the passing of the Maize Control Act the internal price of maize has risen from 6/- to &amp;/- per bag of 200 lbs. Wool prices have risen some 10% since March and the market in hides and skins has been firmer.INDIAN TRAPS. Both imports ana exports showedan increase in May as compared with April,  imports rising from 11,55 lakhs to 11,81 lakhs and exports from 10,93 lakhs to 15,22 lakhs.    The wholesale price index for May at Calcutta was 91 as compared with 88 in April.Standing crops are reported to be in fair to good condition.    The latest all-India wheat estimate shows a yield of 9,820,000 tons as compared with 9,430,000 tons last season. The final figures for the linseed crop show a -production of 418,000 tons against 376,000 tons last season.SOUTH AMERICAN TRAPS.There has been no setback to the steady improvement in economic conditions.    The increased attention given to the production of cotton is noteworthy.    Japanese imports continued to increase and eleven South American countries have now taken action in one form or another to restrict imports from Japan.Argentina. Exports from Argentina shown an increase of 7.7% by value for the first quarter of 1935 as compared with the first quarter of 1934, and imports an increase of 16.3%.    The largest increases were in machines and vehicles (69.1%) and wood and manufactures of wood (57.9%).    Great Britain&apos;s share of the total import trade was 22.2% as compared with 23% a year ago. In the same period Japan&apos;s percentage increased from 1.9% to 4%.    Exports of wheat during the period January to April amounted to 1.8 m.  tons as against
2081o6 mo  tons a year ago and exports of linseed in the same quarter showed an increase of 16.3%.      The wool market is active while meat shipments have &quot;been maintained at the 1954 level0      The 20% surcharge on imports made without a prior exchange permit has given satisfaction to British importers in the Argentine.Brazil.    The Governments fiscal position is obscure and business conditions are depressed.    For the first two months of the year Brazilian exports show a decrease of 1*9% and imports an increase of 49,0% in value as compared with the first two months of 1934.    Exports of coffee were less by 2.8 m0 bags for the season up to the end of February as compared with the year previous and the remaining coffee surplus for 1st July, 1936, is 9,5 m. bags as against a surplus of 4-.5 m. bags at 1st July of this year.      The Government has still not made clear its intentions in regard to measures of control.The sales of cotton to Germany for payment in blocked marks has affected the supply of official exchange to the Bank of Brazil.    It has now been provided that the export of articles which carry an obligation to pay 35% of the relative exchange to the Bank of Brazil can only be effected when paid for in currencies having international circulation, though it is understood that an exception has been made in the case of the Italian li^a.Chile.    Exports from Chile in January to February show an increase of 28.8% and imports (including gold)  an increase of 83.5% over a year ago.    In view of the probable insufficiency of the wheat harvest the Government has fixed maximum prices with the intention of permitting the import of wheat from Argentina if prices rise above  those levels. The Government are unable to offer any more favourable terms for the resumption of the foreign debt service.
209Peru.    Exports from Peru in January show an increase of 11.5 per cent, and imports an increase of 10.7 per cent, over January,  1934.      In the year 1934,  the United Kingdom share of the import trade amounted to 17.5 per cent,  in value. a protection against Japanese competition import quotas have been fixed on imports of cotton manufactures for the six months commencing 1st June.      The quota falling to Great Britain is approximately 34 per cent, of the total.Uruguay.    Exports of wool from Uruguay in March at 11,500 bales show an increase of 6,200 bales over March,   1934, but there is a decrease for the season commencing 1st October of 32,900 bales.      The present indications are that exchange allocation to importers will have to be reduced during the remainder of 1935.Colombia.       A lessening of restrictions in exchange operations has greatly facilitated business.
