THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF -HIS BKIPAHKIO MAJESTY^ (OTSNMSNT. SECRET. Copy No. ..    ^^c7p7I153(35).OABTNEIl?,.IKTERNAT 10NAL LABOUR CONFERENCE, GENEVA.NINSTEEriTH SESSION, JUNE 1955.Proposed Instructions to the British Government Delegates on the subject of unemployment amongst Young Persons.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.UNEMPLOYjvEIg AMONGST YOUNG PERSONS.1.     This is one of the chief subjects on the Agenda of the comingInternational Labour Conference and it is understood that the British TradeUnion representatives will endeavour to use this for the purpose ofcriticising the Government in regard to the raising of the school leaving age,employment of children who are still at school and. juvenile employment andunemployme nt ge ne rally.2,     The Governing Body of the International Labour Organisation, in placing this subject on the agenda of the Conference, considered that, in view of the urgency of the unemployment problem, the Conference should be given an opportunity either to adopt the normal course of settling a Questionnaire to be submitted to Governments with a view to formulating definite proposals next year or to take a final decision on proposals in the form of a Recommendation at the coming Conference.    It is clear that there will be a great effort made to adopt the latter course and that this will be supported by the Workers&apos; Group and opposed by the Employers&apos; Group.3.     The Draft Recommendation, the principal proposals of which are summarised in the attached note3 would require fundamental changes in law and policy in Great Britain.    On the other hand the action already taken in this country and developments under discussion are, in principle, in line with the general trend of the Recommendation.    Having regard to their general attitude tov/ards Government Training Centres and towards the activities of the National Council of Social Service, the Trades Union Congress representatives will have difficulty in supporting the proposals in the Recommendation relating to Recreational and Social Services and Special Employment Centres and this difficulty is accentuated by the narrow division between these proposals and
the compulsory labour and training centres and camps in, for example, Germany, This being so, it may be expected that efforts will be made to eliminate from the Recommendation all provisions contrary to Labour policy, and to re-shape the provisions so that the raising of the school age, the minimum age of admission to employment, and the maintenance of unemployed juveniles and young workers would be the main items.4,     In all the circumstances it would appear to be desirable that the British Government Delegates should support only the settlement at this Conference of points on which Governments may be consulted with a view to a further discussion next year, and that they should oppose the discussion and formulation of definite proposals this year before Governments have had a further opportunity of considering the various points raised.    If this course is adopted, the British Government Delegates would vote against the final settlement of a Draft Recommendation and, if the Conference decided by a majority to adopt this course, the British Delegates would not take part in the discussions.    This would avoid the Government Delegates1 being brought into conflict with the British Workers&apos; representatives on matters which are still under the consideration of the Government and would reduce the chance of use being made for propaganda purposes of these discussions at Geneva.    It is desirable, also, that encouragement should not be given to the attempts being made on this and other subjects to settle Draft Conventions and Recommendations without adequate preparation and consultation seeing that, when such International Draft Conventions and Recommendations have been adopted by the Conference, Governments which do not apply them lay themselves open to criticism.5.     Whatever course the Conference takes, there will certainly bo a general discussion, and British Governirent Delegates will no doubt have to makestatements with regard to the raising of the school leaving age, theemployment of children who are still at school, and the general provision forunemployed juveniles and young persons.    As regards the raising of the school leaving a.ge, it is only possible to say that H. M. Government has this matter under active consideration.    Further, that attention is also being given to thequestion of the employment of children who are still of school age.    It must,however, be understood that H.M. Government is not necessarily committed to theview that the school leaving age and the minimum age of entry into employment2.
should &quot;be identical.    It will, of course, he possible for the Delegates to make a full statement of the measures already adopted in this country, for -providing training and instruction for unemployed juveniles and yo\ing persons. 6.     Subject to any observations that my colleagues may wish to&apos;make, the Government Delegates will be instructed(i) that they should support only the settlement at this Conference of points on which the Government should be consulted, with the view toa further discussion next year;    and (ii) that they should oppose the discussion and formulation of definite proposals this year.(intld.) O.S.25rd May, 1955.
Report on Unemployment among Young Persons. Summary of principal draft recoro-aendations. i; The minimum s.ge for leaving school and being admitted to employment should be fixed now at not less than 15 years. a, 2. Juveniles should continue full-time attendance at school beyond 15until &quot;suitable employment&quot; is available for them, jra, 5. Juveniles who are no longer in full-time attendance at school should berequired to attend Continuation Courses up to the age of 18, whether in employment or unemployed, ra. 6. Where attendance at Continuation Courses is not compulsory for alljuveniles, it should at least be compulsory for those who are unemployed. as. 7-11- For unemployed persons between the ages of 18 and 25, there should bevocational training centres with some provision for general education. Attendance should be made a condition for the receipt of unemployment benefit or allowances. Ijkras. 12-14. Measures should be adopted to facilitate &quot;the useful and agreeableutilisation of the spare time of the young unemployed, such as the establishment of recreational centres, physical training centres, reading rooms, etc.&quot;jaras. 15-32.        Employment centres should be established for unemployed persons between the ages of 18 and 24 inclusive, at which work   could be provided under conditions other than normal conditions of employment.     Adequate safeguards would have to be adopted, to prevent abuses and to prevent the centres from &quot;becoming institutions for military training&quot;.&apos; Paras.55-5 9. These recommendations contain a number of suggestions for the develop-ment of special services, both local and central, for advising juveniles on the choice of employment and placing them in suitable eiaployment.     It is recommended that the policy of a shorter working week should be pursued with special vigour in respect of juvenile employment. &amp;S!!^J2.* To promote re-employment the reduction of hours of work should be pursued with special vigour in respect of employment in which young persons engage.?-^ SlM.* To increase the number of posts for young persons in administrativecareers, the pensionable age of officials should be reduced to 60 years, and public officials should be prohibited from holding more than one post.
