2haHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT). E C R E T..P, IBS (55),. COPY NO.CABINET. ISLE OP MAN (CUSTOMS) BILL,  1955.Memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.A Bill confirming the Customs Resolutions of the Manx legislature is passed annually.. The Isle of Man has a separate financial existence, levying its own taxes and defraying its own expenditure.        In particular ] it is completely free as to Customs duties,  subject to confirma-tion by the Imperial Parliament.      It would be unprecedented for Parliament to alter the duties.The effect of the Resolutions to be confirmed by this Bill -is substantially to apply to the Isle of Man the modifiea-tions in the Customs tariff that are made in this country by the Finance Bill in the case of goods (other than sugar which is not dutiable in the Isle of Man) chargeable with duties under enactments other than the Import Duties Act.      Duties under the Import Duties Act are imposed in the Isle of Man by statutory order not requiring confirmation ex post facto by the Imperial Parliament.      In addition to confirming the outstanding Resolutions of the Manx legislature the Bill includes clauses corresponding to those contained in the current Finance Bill concerning the exemption from duty ef educational films,   the valuation of goods for purposes of ad valorem duties,   the determination of disputes as to the value of goods and the power to charge reduced duty in lieu of general ad valorem duty in exceptional cases.
(intld. )      N,  C.Treasury Chamhers,  S, W.  1. 8th July,  1935.The Bill is practically formal and usually occupies very little Parliamentary time.      There is no reason to anticipate discussion on it this year.      The Whips are anxious that it shall &quot;be introduced, immediately and,   there &quot;being no convenient meeting of the Home Affairs Committee,  I ask authority to introduce it and proceed with it at once subject to any drafting or other minor amendments that may he found necessary.
