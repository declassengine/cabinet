Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1935:SECRET: Copy No.       46CP. 132 (35).CABINET.Air Pact and Air Limitation Agreement. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs.Mr. EDEN has asked the French Government whether they would agree to enter into negotiations with the other Locarno Powers in respect of the proposed Air Pact and Air Limitation Agreement.The two telegrams from Paris now attached show the result of this enquiry. The telegram which I sent him in reply to the first of these telegrams is also attached.Considering how unfavourable was the moment when the enquiry had to be put, the answer must be considered as satisfactory. The two conditions which the French Government have attached to their consent to negotiate were almost inevitable.I would suggest, therefore, that Mr. Eden should be authorised to take note of the fact that the French Government have made these conditions, and then proceed to discuss with them the procedure to be adopted for initiating negotia-tions for the Air Pact and Air Limitation. As to methods of practical procedure in regard to the other elements in the London declaration, His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to keep an open mind until the situation has further developed and the prospects of general agreement can be more clearly estimated than at present.Also it is important that the French Government should agree not to lay down these two conditions at the outset to the German Government, for to do so would probably render the initiation of all negotiations impossible. Since, however, it is to be foreseen that the French Government will be unable to maintain this attitude vis-a-vis of their press and public, it would be sufficient if the French Government were to confine themselves to intimating that they expect progress on other subjects to be simultaneous.As regards procedure, I feel that the time is not ripe for any meeting either of statesmen or of technicians. The various questions set forth in CP. 129 (35) ought, in my opinion, first of all to be discussed and settled in principle through the diplomatic channel. But this raises the further question, by whom these discussions are to be initiated and directed. Should Great Britain, France and Italy make a joint approach to the German Government and invite their views on the various questions at issue; or should His Majesty&apos;s Government offer to circularise all the Locarno Powers and to act as-the clearing house for the exchanges of views which it is hoped thus to provoke ? There is a great deal to be said for this latter course, and I would recommend that Mr. Eden should be authorised to press for it.Lastly, there is the question as to what line Mr. Eden should take when the French Government enquire, as they doubtless will, what His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment propose to do in order to help forward concurrent negotiations on the other three problems which the French Government wish to see settled, i.e., multilateral non-aggression pact in the East, Danubian pact and limitation of land armaments. In regard to the Eastern Pact, the reply is simple. We have only to refer to the interviews which I and Sir R. Vansittart had with Herr von Ribbentrop (Annex 4) and to say that we shall, of course, pursue this pressure. In return, M. Laval should be told that we count on him to see that there will be no obstruction or delay from the Russian or Polish side in any 8005   [11773] B
negotiations there may be for the proposed multilateral pact. (The Soviet Government must not be allowed to think that it is in their power to prevent an Air Agreement between the Western Powers merely by blocking progress in the non-aggression negotiations in the East.)In regard to the Danubian Pact, we should say that here also we shall continue to help to our utmost; but that success in this matter must turn largely on the attitude of the Little Entente. As the French Ambassador has been already informed, the conditions so far imposed by the Little Entente on the meeting of the Rome Conference are so unreasonable as effectively to prevent either the meeting or the fruition of the Conference,As regards limitation of land armaments, it rests with France herself whether there is to be any possible basis on which to negotiate with Germany.To sum up the future course of His Majesty&apos;s Government.In regard to the Eastern Pact, there is no longer any valid reason why a scheme reduced to such relative simplicity should not now be speedily furthered and completed on the terms originally proposed by Germany, which the French Government have now accepted as a basis of discussion. Indeed, the technical difficulties in this matter are considerably less than in the case of the Air Pact. Adherence to the London communique will therefore entail no sacrifice on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Indeed, it has always been fairly clear, and is now completely clear, that no air pacts will be otherwise obtainable.In regard to the Danubian Pact, we must be guided by developments. Progress here will be slower than in the case of the Eastern Pact. If the project matures abreast of the Air Pact, our course will be easy. If it does not, we must so conduct ourselves that the last word lies with Signor Mussolini, not with the French; for Signor Mussolini has already shown a strong practical disposition to conclude an air pact aside from other considerations. In any case, therefore, so far as we are concerned, if we wish for practical progress in the Air Pacts, we must at present not allow the French to suppose that we are in any way aiming at a divorce between these two subjects.As to the limitation of land armaments, it is highly probable that the psychological moment has been missed, and that the settlement, which has evaded us for three and a half years, will continue to prove unattainable. Our eventual tactics, in such an event, would be to put to the French Government that we should all be foolish to allow the three other pacts, then either ready or -nearly ready, to fail for lack of the fourth. In this attitude we should have the support of Italy and Belgium, and probably of a considerable number of other countries. It is necessary in this respect to look ahead; but here also, for the present, it would be a costly mistake in tactics to adopt any attitude which might be construed as a definite departure from the London declaration.S.

&apos; ANNEXES..,&quot; ffi&apos; -      a) ;,.     . . ; :Sir G. Clerk to Sir Samuel II oare.-(Received June. 21.). [By Telephone.](Nos. 128 and 129.)(Telegraphic.) Paris, June 21, 1935.FOLLOWING- from Mr. Eden :-&quot;The conversations to-day with M. Laval and M. Pietri. in. the afternoon were distinctly difficult. M. Laval was clearly, troubled. He had come straight from a Cabinet meeting, where he had had a rough passage from his colleagues and where he had been accused of sending us a note on Anglo-German naval conversations which was much too mild in tone. M. Herriot in particular, he assured me, had been furious. Altogether M. Laval was less buoyant than I have ever known him. ..&apos;\.t       -&quot; To-day&apos;s conversations have left me with the following definite impressions. The Anglo-German naval agreement is regarded here as having struck a blow at communique of 3rd February. Nothing that we can say will modify that judgment. None the less, M. Laval is himself not unduly disposed to cry over spilt milk. He is, however, determined to preserve what is left in the can of 3rd February.&quot; The French Government are prepared to continue naval conversations with us to pave the way for the Naval Conference. After much pressure, however, the best I could secure was that our joint experts might meet in about six weeks&apos; time, but no definite announcement to that effect; can be made now. A meeting earlier than that, M. Laval argued, would imply acquiescence in Anglo-German naval arrangement, and this was quite out of the question. He hoped that the meeting with the Italian naval experts would be subseqeuent to that with the French.&quot; The French Government maintain that they will not agree to piecemeal conclusion of agreements upon portions of communique of 3rd February. I am convinced that they consequently will not conclude an agreement for an Air Pact and for limitation unless as part of a general settlement which will cover an Eastern Pact of Non-aggression (mutual assistance being dropped as unattainable), the Danubian Pact and land armaments.&quot;If above understanding is accepted, French Government are-willing to agree to opening of negotiations for an Air Pact and for limitation at once, provided it is in any case understood that pact will be reinforced by bilateral agreements to be concluded between any two of the parties who so desire. One of those bilateral pacts would have to be between United Kingdom and France.&quot; I fear it will be impossible to secure agreement with the French Government for negotiation of an Air Pact and limitation upon any other terms, and my present judgment, is. that it will be better to work upon this basis than to allow all negotiations to come to a standstill. We have agreed to adjourn conversations until midday to-morrow, when I am lunching with M. Laval, by which time I should be grateful if I may be given some material to enable me to reply to him.&quot; If you consider it impossible to come to any definite conclusion on this matter at once, I might perhaps tell M. Laval that I hope to be in a position to take up this discussion again on my wajr back from Rome, when in any event I shall have to see him to report on outcome of discussions there.&quot;[11773]
Sir G. Clerk to Sir Samuel Hoare. (Received June 22, 1935.)[By Telephone.](No. 130.)(Telegraphic.) Paris.FOLLOWING from Mr. Eden :-&quot; I had an hour&apos;s conversation alone with M. Laval this morning previous to a luncheon which he gave in honour of His Majesty&apos;s Minister before his departure for Belgrade. M. Laval began by expressing his most sincere gratitude for personal letter which he had received from you and which had clearly greatly pleased him, I told M. Laval that I had communicated to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment my appreciation of the previous day&apos;s conversations in the following terms :- &quot; The French Government were willing to proceed with negotiation of an air pact and limitation on two conditions : &quot; (1) That the pact was buttressed by a bilateral arrangement which might be between several Powers, but must be between France and Great Britain.&quot; (2) That the pact should not become operative until agreement had also been reached upon other  subjects mentioned  in  communique  of . 3rd February,   M. Laval replied that this was a true statement of the ; position of the French Government, and I informed him that I hoped to be in a position to talk over with him the reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government on my way, back from Rome.&quot; In the meanwhile there were one or two personal observations on the situation which I wished to make. His Majesty&apos;s Government attached importance, as did the French Government, to all matters in the communique of 3rd February. My own anxiety was lest after weeks of negotiation we should find ourselves unable to make progress on one of these items, for example, the Danubian Pact, in respect of which the situation was clearly complex. If at the end of that period the coming into operation of the air pact was to be held up for what might appear an indefinite period, our public opinion would certainly become restive. Moreover, if it was true, and I thought it was, that the German Government attach value to the negotiation of an air pact, was there not a danger in the rapid increaseof the German air force. It was for these and other reasons that we attached the utmost-importance [ ? to making] rapid progress with the air pact and limitation. M. Laval said that he quite understood our position, but that it was not necessary now to visualise the position which might arise if progress upon one item of the London communique were unduly delayed. What was essential was that Germany should make some positive contribution in Europe. If negotiation of the Eastern Pact of Non-Aggression (he himself had now yielded on mutual assistance, which had been included in London communique) could be rapidly advanced this would much facilitate his task. He hoped that His Majesty&apos;s Government would give him all the support they could with the German Government to this end.&quot; The conversation this morning was definitely less difficult than that of yesterday, and at its close M. Laval and I agreed to the terms in which he should report to the press the results of the last two days.&quot; I admitted that delay in sending the French experts for the naval conversa-tions is disappointing, and I will take up this subject again with M. Laval on my return. In the meanwhile, it would,.I am sure,.he wiser not to press, the French&apos;Government on this subject through their Embassy in London. &apos;.&quot; French, insistence on bilateral pacts as a supplement to the air pact is due to their conviction that only thus can pact itself be made fully operative., and only thus,: therefore, can they obtain a quid pro quo for the new commitment which they.are undertaking towards us.&quot; , :,
Sir Samuel Hoare to Sir G. Clerk&apos;(Paris).(No. 156.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, June 22, 1935.FOLLOWING for Mr. Eden :-&quot; I have received your telegrams Nos. 128 and 129.&quot; I am very glad to know that the French Government are prepared to initiate a negotiation on Air Pact and air limitation on certain conditions flowing from the London communique of 3rd February.&quot; I myself see no reason why we should not give French Government satisfactory replies on your return, but if you tell them this I suggest that it would be unwise to give them too definite a pledge on the subject.&quot; The reason why I cannot give you definite reply to-day is that the Prime Minister (and incidentally also Sir R. Vansittart) are away in the country.&quot;(4.)Record of Interview with Herr von Ribbentrop.HERR von RIBBENTROP came to see me to-day and I congratulated him on the conclusion of the naval agreement which, I said, was his first exploit as Ambassador at large.After some discourse on the part of Herr von Ribbentrop as to his views on the future of Europe, he proceeded to say that he trusted the next step would now be the speedy conclusion of an air agreement.I replied that we also were anxious for the conclusion of such an agreement, but that it would be a matter in which all the Locarno Powers would be involved and in which they would all have to act in unison. It was therefore in the power of Germany now to make (and at as early a date as possible) a considerable contribution to this unison. I was referring, I said, explicitly to the Eastern Pact. Herr von Ribbentrop, I said, would, no doubt, have noticed that the reception of the naval agreement in France had not been a favourable one. That was to be expected, and I felt confident that with the passage of a little time this impression might well change into a better appreciation of the general advantages inherent in the agreement. These advantages, I said again, I for one very fully appreciated and endorsed. The reaction in the French press, however, must be noted and the necessary lesson drawn from it. It was being intimated in France that we had been occupying ourselves only with the things that particularly interested us, to the exclusion of subjects that interested others more. It was obvious that were the French Government to proceed with an air pact without the necessary progress having been made in regard to the Eastern Pact, they would be exposed to the same charge from Russia and the Little Entente. I felt sure that in their present mood they would be very reluctant to expose themselves to it. The remedy, however, was a very simple one, and it lay in the hands of Germany. Germany had refused to contemplate any system of mutual assistance in Eastern Europe, and that was now well understood and accepted. At the time, however, of the British visit to Berlin, the German Government had stated that it would be prepared to negotiate on a basis of non-aggression and consultation, and had, indeed, handed to Sir John Simon a project to this effect. After the lapse of some time the French, as we now know, had informed the German Government on the 3rd June that they were prepared to take this as a basis of discussion. An Eastern Pact was now, therefore, open to the German Government on their own terms and there could surely now no longer be the slightest reason for not proceeding with it.Herr von Ribbentrop replied that the German Government already had a series of treaty arrangements with the Russian Government, and that Herr Hitler himself had renewed the latest of them. He, therefore, did not see the necessity for any addition to this complex.
I replied that I was well aware of the existing treaties and of Herr Hitler&apos;s renewal, and, therefore, for the very reason stated by Herr von Ribbentrop him-self, I-thought there was no reason any longer for not proceeding with the Eastern Pact in its now simplified draft form. The very fact that the German Govern-ment thought that it added little to the existing situation must be an argument against recalcitrance on their part. On the other hand, if goodwill were shown in the making of this advance from their own basis, an excellent impression would be produced, and I felt convinced that we should all find the negotiation of an air pact would thereby be facilitated at no real additional cost to the German Government.Herr von Ribbentrop replied that progress in this direction would be difficult because of the strained relations between Germany and Russia, and the fundamental divergencies of their two systems. Nobody in Germany felt disposed to embrace Soviet Russia.I replied that there was no question in.anybody&apos;s mind of embraces or affections, which on either side might conceivably be held to be unnatural. That was not the point. What really mattered was that Germany, by taking the action I now proposed, would be disarming her critics, and they were many; particularly in Eastern Europe, where, as he was well aware, Germany&apos;s ultimate intentions were matters of deep suspicion.Herr von Ribbentrop repudiated any hostile intention on the part of Germany towards Russia. I replied that I took full note of what he said. None the less, those suspicions existed, and it was in the power of Germany to take a very small and easy step forward which would largely discount them.Herr von Ribbentrop assured me that when,he returned to Berlin he would take the matter up with Herr Hitler and would bear in mind in so doing the observations that I had made to him.I repeated as we parted, after renewing my congratulations, that I thought that this next step would be particularly welcome if the delay in replying to the French communication of the 3rd June was not unduly prolonged.I think it might be well to inform the French and Russian Governments of the substance of this interview.Herr von Ribbentrop, in a word, appeared somewhat embarrassed on this topic, but by no means unwilling to listen to reason.- R. V.:    June 19, 1935,.
