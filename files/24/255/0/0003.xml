Copy No.CP. 88 (35).CABINET.PROPOSED AERIAL CONVENTION.Draft Treaty oe Mutual Guarantee Against Air Attack.IN accordance with Conclusion (8) (b) of the 269th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, I circulate to the Cabinet the attached note,, which has been prepared by the Air Ministry, in consultation with the Foreign Office, in regard to the Draft Treaty of Mutual Guarantee Against Air Attack.L.April 27, 1935.1. In accordance with the decision of the Committee of Imperial Defence at the 269th Meeting on the 16th April, 1935, the following note is submitted by the Air Ministry, in consultation with the Foreign Office, on certain points relating to the tentative draft for an Air Convention which the Foreign Office had communicated to the Committee of Imperial Defence.2. The Air Ministry are in general agreement with the draft, subject to the undermentioned observations, which have been discussed with the Foreign Office.3. Article 1. (i) The Air Ministry consider that the words &quot; deliberate and &quot; should be inserted before &quot; unprovoked aggression,&quot; in line 2; the Foreign Office point out that these words had been omitted as being unnecessary in view of the use of the phrase &quot; unprovoked aggression,&quot; but otherwise they would have no objection to the insertion of these words.(ii) The Air Ministry would have preferred to have specific provision made for the High Contracting Parties satisfying themselves in regard to the occurrence of the aggression, but the Foreign Office view is that (1) the French Government would be suspicious of such a provision, (2) each Party has in any case the right to satisfy himself, whether it is so stated or not. The Air Ministry are not altogether satisfied in regard to the omission of the proposed provision, and suggest that the question should be further considered.(iii) The Air Ministry consider that aggression &quot;in or over European waters &quot; should be included in the scope of the guarantee, so as to cover air attack on shipping, or on aircraft over the sea. The Foreign Office regard this question as one for the Air Ministry and the Admiralty.4. Article 2. (i) The Air Ministry consider that this Article should be slightly reworded so as to make it clear that the &apos;&apos; war &apos;&apos; referred to in line 3 is a current war. The Foreign Office agree that this drafting alteration might well be made.(ii) Under the Article as it stands a contracting State (&quot; A &quot;) can make an air attack upon another contracting State (&quot; B &quot;) without bringing the mutual assistance guarantee into operation if &quot; B &quot; had resorted to war in violation of treaty obligation against a third State (&quot; C &quot;). The Air Ministry suggest that &quot; B &quot; should have the benefit of the guarantee in such a case unless &quot;A&quot; was bound by treaty or general convention to assist &quot; C.&quot; The Foreign Office see difficulty about such a provision, which will be further discussed between the two Departments.April 27, 1935,[11525]
