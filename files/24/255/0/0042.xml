- 218(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.) S E C R E T.CP.  127 (35). COPY NO.    (jJi,CABIN E T c VOLUNTARY HOSPITALS (PAYING PATIENTS) BILL. Memorandum &quot;by the At to rney-Gene ral 0This memorandum is submitted for the purpose of seeking the approval of the Cabinet to facilities being given by the Government in the House of Commons for the passing of the Voluntary Hospitals (Paying Patients) Bill, which has recently been passed by the House of Lords and is now awaiting consideration by the House of Commons.2,0 This Bill was introduced in the House of Lords by LordLukes acting on behalf of the King Edward VII Hospital Fund, with the approval of the British Hospitals Association and the British Medical Association, and its purpose is to empower voluntary hospitals, with the authority of the Charity Commissioners, to provide accommodation and treatment for patients who are prepared to pay therefor.3. At the present time, many voluntary hospitals areprevented by the terms of the trusts under which they are established from providing hospital facilities in return for payment,,      At the same time, recent advances in medicine and surgery have necessitated greatly increased expenditure by the hospitals, while there has been a marked decline in charitable donations.      As a result of these two factors,, some hospitals have had to curtail their accommodation, while other hospitals have. notwithstanding the possibility that such action is a breach of trusts contracted with patients. local authorities
and workmen&apos;s associations, to provide treatment in returnfor specific charges.      Moreover, there is, of course, a greatdemand for hospital accommodation for persons who cannot he considered as falling within, the description of &quot;poor&quot; orindigent poor or descriptions of a like natures which restrict the trust under which many voluntary hospitals are functioning today.4. During recent years,  certain voluntary hospitals have obtained powers by Private Act to provide accommodation for paying patients and certain other Private Bills are now before Parliament seeking similar powers.    In the early part of last year, I submitted to the Cabinet that it was undesirabl that hospitals should be put to the great expense of Private Bill legislation, unless it was absolutely necessary, and that it was j, in my view, preferable that the provision of paying patients accommodation by voluntary hospitals should be regulated by a public general Act.    The proposals which I put before the Cabinet were approved (Cabinet Paper 4 (34)). and authority was given for the preparation of a Bill for the purpose.      In giving their sanction, the Cabinet laid stress on the importance of inserting in the Bill proper safeguards to ensure that funds intended for the provision of free hospitals facilities for the poor should not be diverted for the benefit of paying patients.      In accordance with this authority, a Bill was prepared containing what I considered to be adequate safeguards and was submitted through the Minister of Health to the King Edward VII Hospital Fund and the British Medical Association.      These Associations, however, considered that the Bill did not go as far as they desired and the Bill was accordingly not introduced.      In the early part of this year, however. Lord Luke introduced the present Bill into the House of Lords and, upon the second reading, Lord Hailsham, on behalf of the Government,expressed the view that the Government could only approve of the Bill if
220safeguards were introduced into it which would prevent the property or funds of hospitals, which were subject to trusts in favour of the poor, being diverted for the benefit of paying patients5  and he indicated that amendments to that end would be put down by the Government on the Committee stage of the Bill.      These amendments were 5 in due course, moved in Committee and were  accepted by the House of Lords.    The present Bills therefore, contains all the safeguards which I think are necessary to safeguard the position of the poor, as was required by the Cabinet when the matter was before them in. the early part of last year, and, in fact, the Bill in its present form is almost identical with the Bill which the Government proposed to introduce in accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s authority which was then obtainede5. It seems to me that it is highly desirable thatgeneral legislation should be passed authorising voluntary hospitals to provide paying patients accommodation9 with the authority of the Charity Commissioners, and subject to the safeguards to which I have referred, rather than that it should be left to voluntary hospitals to promote, a series of Private Bills, which may be different in form and which may not contain the safeguards which ought to be included.60 I understand that the Ministry of Health agree that facilities should be granted for the passage of the Bill; and Lord Luke, the promoter of the present Bill, has informed me that he has been in communication with the Labour Opposition in the House of Commons and that they have promised to  support the Bill.      In these circumstances, I have to request that facilities be afforded by the Government for the passage of the Bill during the present Session of Parliament.(Intldo) T.W.H.I.LAV/ OFFICERS &apos; DEPARTMENT, 19th June, 1935.
