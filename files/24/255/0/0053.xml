Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1935.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 138 (35)CABINET.SUPPLY OF ARMS TO ABYSSINIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a memorandum dealing with the question, of the supply of arms to Abyssinia. Unless some unforeseen developments occur, I do not propose to ask the Cabinet for an immediate decision on this point, but I am circulating this paper now in order that my colleagues may have time to consider the various aspects of this difficult question.S. H.Foreign Office, July 8, 1935.Memorandum.THE preamble to the treaty signed in Paris on the 21st August, 1930,. between the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Ethiopia, declares than one of its objects is to enable the Emperor of Abyssinia &quot; to obtain all the arms and munitions necessary for the defence of his territories from external aggression and for the preservation of internal order therein.&quot; Under this treaty the^ United Kingdom, France and Italy &quot; undertake to&apos; permit&quot; the transit to Ethiopia across their respective adjacent territories of arms and ammunition for the Emperor, provided that these are accompanied by the documents, and the cases covered by the markings, there specified. At the same time, under the last paragraph of article 9 of the treaty, the United Kingdom, France and Italy are bound to refuse to authorise the transit, if the attitude or disturbed condition, of Ethiopia constitutes a threat to peace or public order.2. Since the tension with Italy became acute, Ethiopia has been purchasing arms in continental countries and, possibly, in the United States of America, though details are lacking of the quantity obtained. It is known, however, that consignments have been imported via Jibuti and the railway to Addis Ababa, which passes through French territory. No arms or munitions have, however,, been exported to Ethiopia from the United Kingdom since September 1934.3. Purchases of arms, &amp;o, by Abyssinia have naturally run counter to Italian wishes, and diplomatic action has accordingly been taken by the Italian Government to cut off supplies. It IS clS cl result of this pressure that within the last two or three months Germany, Belgium and Czechoslovakia have given Italy assurances that henceforth exports of arms from these countries destined for Ethiopia would be prohibited.4. The French Government have forbidden the export of arms and munitions by French citizens either to Italy or to Ethiopia, while the French authorities at Jibuti are under instructions to detain, in accordance with article 170 of the Treaty of Versailles, all arms, munitions, &amp;o, exported from or originating in8028   [11857]
Germany. On the other hand, the French Government have informed His Majesty5s Government that they would not consider themselves justified in stopping shipments in transit provided these are marked as laid down in article 6 of the treaty., : 5. - In the case of the United Kingdom, it is only recently that any interest has been displayed in the possibility of sales to Ethiopia. Possibly owing to the closing of continental sources of supply as described in the preceding paragraph, both Imperial Chemical Industries (3 or 4 million cartridges) and Vickers (five anti-aircraft guns on motor-chassis) have lately sounded the Foreign Office informally as to whether, in the event of their accepting Ethiopian orders, export licences would be forthcoming. In addition, some interest has been displayed by Walford Lines (Limited), a firm believed to be connected with Vickers, in the possibility of shipping arms and munitions emanating from foreign sources to Ethiopia via British Somaliland (to avoid possible seizure or delay at the French port of Jibuti). No such shipments through British territory have so far been made, but within the last week applications have been received by the Board of Trade for licences to export from England from the B.S.A. Guns (Limited) and from the Soley Armament Company (Limited). The first covers 5,000 rifles, 2\ million rounds of ammunition and 24 Lewis machine guns. The second covers 10,000 rifles and 10 million rounds. Both applications are for shipment to Berbera to the order of the Government of Abyssinia.6. Exports of arms and munitions from the United Kingdom to Italy since November 1934 have amounted to three air vessels for torpedoes, and 100,000 rounds of 12-7 mm. ammunition (March 1935).7. Before deciding whether or not His Majesty&apos;s Government should, as far as lies in their power, facilitate the purchase of arms, ammunition and war material by the Abyssinian Government, and their import into Abyssinia, my colleagues will wish to know precisely what obligations in this respect the United Kingdom has undertaken under the terms of the Treaty of 1930.8. As regards transit to Abyssinia across British territories adjacent thereto, as I have already stated, we are pledged to permit such transit provided the articles are accompanied by an order in writing or endorsement of the Abyssinian Government in the prescribed form, which certifies that they are being supplied direct to the Abyssinian Government, and by an export licence, also in the prescribed form. Explosives, sporting weapons and revolvers may be consigned to persons other than the Abyssinian Government subject to the consent of the latter. Exceptionally, if the attitude or disturbed condition of Abyssinia con-stitutes a threat to peace or public order, we have undertaken to refuse to authorise transit until this threat has ceased to exist. But we are bound to allow free passage of arms, &amp;c, which are necessary to enable the legitimate authorities in Abyssinia to assure the maintenance of public order.9. As regards the export of arms from the United Kingdom, there is no clause in the treaty specifically binding His Majesty&apos;s Government to allow such export. The treaty prescribes, however, the nature of certain documents which must be presented to the competent authorities of the exporting country by a representative of the Ethiopian Government before export takes place (article 2). While, therefore, the treaty contains no obligation to allow export, as it does in the case of transit, it is reasonable to conclude from the provisions in question that it was the intention when the treaty was concluded that export from the United Kingdom should as a general rule be permitted, provided that the prescribed documents were presented, unless there were special reasons,to the -contrary.
