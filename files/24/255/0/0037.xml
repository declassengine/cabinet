DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT). BE T.COPY NO.122 (55).C A B I NET. HOUSING- POLICY COMMITTEE. FOURTH REPORT.1. The Committee held a further Meeting on 7th June, 1935,to consider certain points which have arisen during the Committee Stage of the Housing (Scotland)  Bill.      While  this  stage has now been completed without substantial amendment,  the Secretary of State for Scotland reported to the Committee that&apos; supporters of the Govern-ment, both in the House of Commons and in Scotland, have strongly pressed for the modification of the Bill in certain respects.2. In the opinion of the Secretary ef State for Scotland only two of these matters call for the consideration of the Cabinet.3. The first of these is the demand that the Bill should providefor a reconditioning grant to private owners of property in urban areas.      This demand has been urgently pressed, particularly from the Glasgow area.    At their Meeting on 6th March, 1935, the Cabinet (Cabinet 13 (35) Conclusion 3(c))  referred this question to the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Health and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries for examination.      This exam-ination is proceeding, and- pending its completion and a decisioniof the Cabinet upon Its&apos; results, the Committee recommend t hate no announce mehi on the subject of a reconditioning grant  should he made.4, The second point is concerned with the demand that the law relating tc rating in Scotland should be amended, in order to relieve unlet property from owners&apos;   rates.      While this proposal is otttside the scope of the present Bill the Secretary of State for Scotland favours an announcement that the Government intend, to deal with the de-rarfing of unlet houses in Scotland by a separate measure.
-5. When this question was hefore the Cabinet on 20thFebruary last (Cabinet 10-(35) Conclusion 9)  the proposal was limited to houses of not mere than 2 apartments, and the Secretary cf State for Scotland was authorised to consult with representatives of the Local Authorities before including in the Bill a provision exempting from owners&apos;  rates unoccupied houses cf &apos;me or two apartments.      The Scottish Local Author-ities did not regard the proposal with favour,6-, In the opinion of the Secretary of State for Scotlandif the principle is conceded it will be difficult to resist the extension of the concession to three or four-apartment houses, and possibly further.f\        After careful consideration the Committee agree that the Secretary cf State for Scotland should make an announcement in regard to the rating of tUvlet property to the effect set out in (2)  of the following paragraph, but that before any announcement is made a decision should be reached on the size of house to be included in the concession.      On further examination It may be found that there are good logical reasons for drawing the line at a certain point, and if this can be done the future maintenance of the decision will be greatly facilitated.9&apos;. The Committee submit the following recommendations tothe Cabinet :-(l)  That pending consideration by the Cabinet of the results of the examination now being held, into the question cf the provision of a reconditioning grant to private owners of property in urban areas in Scotland, n*a announcement on this  subject should be made.(2) That the Secretary of State for scotland should be authorised to make an announcement in the House of Commons on the subject of the. derating of unlet houses at some time prior to the Third Reading of the Bill to the effect that, whilst no alteration: with regard t&apos;j this matter could be introduced into the Bill itself,  it was the intention
cf the Government in the next Session of Parliament &quot;to introduce a special Bill for the purpose of derating, to the extent of 75 per cent,  in respect of owners&apos;  rates, unlet small house property in Scotland, and that an exact definition of the term small house property would he announced later.(3)    That prior to the announcement in (2) above, a decision should be reached by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Scotland on the size of house to be included in the proposed concession.Signed on behalf of the Committee N.   CHAMBERLAIN;, CHAIRMAN.whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. t June,  1935.
