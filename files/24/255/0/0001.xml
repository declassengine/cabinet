(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO.SECRET.CP.    86 (35)C A B I N E T india appreciation of the Political Situation,, by the Government of India, dated   15th April 1935-Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential Appreciation of the Political Situation in India, dated the loth April, 1935, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.During the last month, interest has centred on the proceedings of the Legislative Assembly.      The Congress Opposition, whenever they could rely on any support from members of the other parties,  carried many divisions against the Government and finally succeeded in making such drastic alterations in taxation proposals that it became necessary for the Governor-General to exercise his power of certification.      statements made by their leaders show that their general policy was to force the Government to act contrarily to the decisions of the House and thereby to expose the &quot;naked autocracy&quot; of an alien Government.      x&apos;hough not in sufficient strength to create complete obstruction they endeavoured to hamper and &apos; prolong the proceedings by numerous notions for the adjournment of the House, many of which were disallowed; by prolonged discussions on points of order, the majority of which were untenable;    and by lengthy cross-examinations of Government members on their replies to questions. 2.      in the course of a debate on a motion to censure the Government for its &quot;repressive&quot; policy which was moved by the Nationalist party, who, on this point, are at one with congress, it became clear that many members of the party had very considerable sympathy with the terrorists.      This sympathy was also exhibited during the debate on a Bill introduced to repeal one of the &quot;repressive&quot; Acts which gives power to Local Governments to declare associations unlawful.      The attitude adopted by the Opposition fully justified the vigorous and effective
speech made by the Law Member, Sir U. Sircar,  in which he proved conclusively, by reference to the judicial findings in criminal cases, that many of the terrorists were members of Congress organisations in Bengal and that many of those organisations were used to conceal terrorist conspiracies.      He further pointed out that, in spite of Mr. Gandhi&apos;s condemnation of violence, many Congress leaders had by their speeches encouraged the youth of Bengal&apos; &quot;to follow these methods by vehement condemnation of the Government and by extravagant praise of those who had suffered for their crimes.      This attitude of sympathy for the terrorists is also exemplified by the growing agitation that the Silver Jubilee should be the occasion for the release of those confined without trial, a suggestion which overlooks the fact that in the past any general amnesty has only led to a revival of the movement. The cases of individual detenus are constantly reviewed by the Local Governments and releases are sanctioned whenever they are satisfied that suspects can be kept under adequate supervision and control.3.      In the Provinces the month has, with one exception, been uneventful.      The exception was the serious incident which occurred at Karachi on 19th March on the occasion of the execution of Abdul Qaiyum, a fanatical Muslim murderer of a Hindu who was alleged to have insulted the religion of Islam.      A huge crowd collected at the burial and although the relatives of Abdul Qaiyum were anxious to complete the burial in the cemetery, the more violent and fanatical members of the crowd determined to take the body in procession through the town of Karachi.      If this had been permitted there can be no doubt that very serious
communal rioting would have occurred.      The local authorities determined, rightly, that all possible steps must be taken to prevent the mob from entering the city. So frenzied&apos; and determined was the mob that a platoon of a British regiment was forced to open fire at short range, not merely to prevent any further advance of the mob, but to save themselves from being overwhelmed.      In Hindu circles the action taken has been applauded;    but the Muslims, and in particular those of the town of Karachi, have contended that the mob was peaceful and that its forcible-dispersal was unjustifiable and have demanded that there must be a public enquiry into the incident. 4.      This demand has been refused by the Government of Bombay with the full approval of the Government of India, for it was felt that there was no doubt as to the factes, and that,  in view of the strong feeling held by members of the two communities, it would be impossible to secure an impartial tribunal,  especially if, as was proposed, non-officials were appointed to it.     A public enquiry of any kind would tend also to increase communal bitterness. Further, though in cases of this kind the&apos; Government must investigate carefully the steps taken by local officers to meet a difficult situation, yet there, are clear objections to holding a public enquiry as to the propriety of the action taken.      The risks involved in allowing an excited crowd to enter a town inhabited by persons of other communities are strikingly brought out by an incident recently reported from a small town in Agra district where,&apos; as a result.of a dispute over a Moharram procession, rioting occurred, in the course of which eleven Hindus were burnt to death in a house in which they had barricaded themselves.
