 PPTEEjHTH REPORT.STATISTICS OF  POPULATION  AND  THEIR  RELEVANCE  to continue CHANGE.Introductory.QUR terms of reference require us, in addition to preparing periodical reports on the economic situation, to advise from time to time as to the continuous study of economic development. In this report we propose to deal with two points which seem to us to have special importance at the present time. The first of these concerns the intervals at which censuses of the population should be held; the second, a small addition which we wish to recommend should be made to the particulars required to be furnished at the registrations of births.I. The need for an intermediate census of population.2. There is, perhaps, no department of economic knowledge in which closer statistical investigation would be more profitable than that which deals with the distribution of the whole population in age groups, in geographical regions, and in industrial and occupational classes. The first and most obvious step, which can be taken to improve our knowledge of these matters, is to increase the frequency with which censuses of the population are held. Power already exists to hold a census at any time in or after 1936, and we think it desirable to call attention to certain general considerations to which we attach great importance and which we hope may lead His Majesty&apos;s Government to hold the next census at the earliest date that is administratively feasible. It would, in our opinion, be desirable that, if possible, the next census should be held in 19.36, and that this should be the forerunner of a regular series of quinquennial censuses. If, however, it should prove impracticable to hold &amp; census next year, we think that there are special reasons, which we develop in paragraph 9 below, for holding a census at latest in 1937. We recognise that if a census were held in that year it would be necessary before 1940 &quot;to amend the Census A.ct, 1920, in order to ensure that the next ordinary census was held in 1941.3. The effects of the coming decline in our population on the prospects of overseas trade, on the possibility of capital investment in housing and industrial equipment, and on the difficulties with which the labour force is faced in adapting itself to changes in demand, are beginning to be more widely appreciated! In each of these spheres difficult problems of economic adjustment are likely to arise. Just as the economic history of the nineteenth century was affected in almost every sphere by the vast increase in the population which then took place, so the history of the twentieth century is likely to be remarkable for the profound readjustments which will become necessary through the reversal of this trend. But, whereas in the nineteenth century it was the settled principle of economic policy that individual initiative alone should be relied on to effect the adaptation of the nation&apos;s economic structure to secular changes in demand, the twentieth century has seen a growing inclination on the part of government to undertake a greater degree of responsibility for the control of economic events. We need only refer to the developments which the last thirty years have seen in commercial policy, in housing policy, and, above all, in the sphere of social insurance, to illustrate the increasing intervention of the state in economic affairs. And as this intervention grows, the need for accurate and up-to-date statistical information grows with it. . .4. As an instance of the need for elaborate statistical material, we may quote the administration of the Unemployment Fund. So long as the industrial population, is increasing, the changes required in the distribution of labour between different occupations can be effected if the flow of new entrants into industry is directed into those occupations which are showing a tendency to increase relatively to the whole industrial population. When, however, the whole [11374] b 2
industrial population is declining, the stream of new entrants may be too small to effect the proportionate changes in the distribution of labour between different occupations which are required. A surplus of labour is then likely to appear in particular occupations which can only be absorbed by workers transferring themselves from one occupation to another. But it is well known that as workers grow older they find it increasingly difficult to acquire a new technique. Thus, wherever there is a concentration of older workpeople in a declining industry, a pocket of unemployment is formed which does not disappear with an improve-ment in general trading conditions. The age distribution of labour in declining industries is therefore one of the most important factors determining the level of the more or less permanent unemployment which has been one of the most noticeable features of the post-war period.5. Rather similar considerations apply to the problem of the depressed areas. As the population of these areas comes to consist of older people, it will be increasingly difficult to move it to the newer industrial districts which, since the war, have been able to absorb some of the unemployed from other districts. A correct knowledge of the age distribution of the population of these areas is therefore of the greatest importance in forming an opinion of the length of time for which these areas will present a special problem and the kind of remedies ^appropriate to their needs.6. Accurate knowledge of the age and industrial distribution of the population is perhaps of even greater importance to local authorities than to the central government. While population was generally increasing, an over-estimate of the normal requirements of an area in such matters as the supply of water, electricity, gas, and transport facilities did not entail serious financial -consequences. For after the lapse of a reasonable interval the normal increase of the population could absorb any surplus capacity brought about by the too rapid extension of facilities of this kind. In future, however, it will be impossible to expect this kind of automatic adjustment. The result of an over-estimate &apos;of the demand in any locality for these services will be to saddle it with a load of unprofitable debt which the diminishing financial resources of a declining population will only support with increasing difficulty.7. Further examples of the increasing need for statistical information could be cited in other departments of public administration, such as, for instance, the educational and health services. They would, however, only serve to emphasise the same conclusion, that the development of social policy requires the government and local authorities constantly to take decisions the wisdom or unwisdom of which largely depends on their being grounded on a correct estimate of the trends of the distribution of population between different categories.8. We cannot believe that, in the exceptional circumstances of the present decade, a decennial census provides adequate material for the important conclu-sions which require to be based upon its findings. Very soon the information available relates to a period which no longer has any practical significance to the problems which emerge in the day-to-day business of government. Take, for example, the classification of the occupied population into occupational and industrial groups. The volumes of the census taken in 1931 dealing with these subjects were published in the year 1934. Before their appearance it was necessary to rely on the census of 1921, a year in which the occupational and industrial distribution of the population was seriously influenced by the special features of the war and post-war period. If the present practice of decennial censuses is adhered to, no further volume dealing with these questions will appear until 1944, and the effects of the profound economic changes which have occurred -since 1931 will remain imperfectly known until that date. If, on the other hand, a census were held in 1936 or 1937 it would be not unreasonable to hope that the results of it would be known within at least two years. For the increased -staff which would be necessary would be able to tabulate the results more quickly than is now possible.9. These general considerations are re-inforced by certain particular features of the years 1936 and 1937. Some time before the year 1941 the popula-tion of Great Britain is likely to reach its maximum size. The distribution of the population, in ages, in geographical regions, and in economic classes at the time
of this maximum size is bound to acquire a special importance as a standard from which the effects of the subsequent decline may be measured. It is therefore highly desirable that this distribution should be known with the greatest possible approximation to the facts. In view of the rapidity with which changes are taking place in the distribution of the population, the absence of census figures either for the year 1936 or for the year 1937 would seriously detract from the reliability of any statistical estimates which it would be possible to construct. It would be extremely unfortunate if future statistical investigations into the social effects of the decline in our population were to be embarrassed by the lack of this essential material.II. The need for additional particulars at the registration of births.10. We turn to the consideration of a matter quite distinct from, but closely related to, the issue discussed in the first part of this report. The economic importance of the change that is in process from an increasing to a decreasing population gives added significance to estimates of the future trend of popula-tion. If these estimates are to be based on full and reliable data, the outstanding need in our vital statistics is to obtain information, when births are registered, as to the ages of the parents, and more particularly of the mothers.11. The changing age composition among women of child-bearing age is an important factor in estimating the number of births that may be expected in the future. Owing to the fall in the annual number of births in the past twenty years, the number of married women between the ages of 20-30 is likely to decline, while the number between the ages of 30-45 will continue for some time to increase. Now it is obvious that 1,000 married women between the ages of 20-30 are likely to have many more children in any year than 1,000 married women between the ages of 30-45. But how many more, there is no means of ascertaining from British vital statistics. We know the number of married women in the different age-groups; we know the total number of children born; but we do not know how many of the mothers of these children belong to the different age-groups.12. Accordingly, those who attempt to compute population figures for the future have either to ignore the influence of the changing age-composition among women of child-bearing age, or to measure it on the basis of the statistics of other countries which collect information as to the ages of mothers. In the latter case, it is assumed in effect that the fertility-rates for different age-groups bear the same relation to one another in Great Britain that they do in some other country (usually Sweden), for which precise statistics are available. This assumption may not be far from the truth, but it is impossible to be sure upon the point and it is highly unsatisfactory that we should have to rely in this matter upon the statistics of other countries.13. The way to remedy the deficiency is obvious and simple, namely, to require that the age of the mother, and, it might be desirable, of the father too, should be recorded when a birth is registered. This is already required in many other countries. The Ministry of Health already possesses power under the Registration Act, 1874, to make an Order providing that this information should he furnished. Such a change would cause virtually no additional trouble to the public and little additional expense to the Registrar-General&apos;s Department. Women, of whatever age, have at present to disclose their age at the Census. We do not anticipate that there would be any serious objection on the part of the public to this change. We hope, therefore, that His Majesty&apos;s Government will give favourable consideration to this reform in procedure.(Signed on behalf of the Committee) :J. C.
