(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).Note by the secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.1*   For the Foreign Affairs Debate on Thursday Cabinet authority is needed (following the recommendation of the Defence Requirements Committee today) for a statement to be made in opening the Debate confirming the Lord President&apos;s declaration of November 28th last that His Majestyfs Government &quot;are determined in no conditions to accept any position of inferiority with regard to whatever air force may be raised in Germany in the future&quot; and for the announcement that the necessary decisions have been reached and measures will be taken to implement that declaration In the new conditions that have arisen,    i suggest that the lines of the statement might run somewhat as follows;-&quot;i-n the Debate last November certain estimates were put forward on the basis of our then information, as to the strength of the German air force and the&apos; assurance was given by the Lord President on behalf of the Government that in no circumstances will we accept any position of inferiority with regard to whatever air force may be raised in Germany in the future   In the course of the visit which the Lord Privy Seal and 1 paid to Berlin at the end of March, the German Chancellor stated (as I informed the House on April 3rd) that Germany had reached parity with Great Britain in the airu   Our Air Attache&quot; in Berlin was subsequently informed that this statement refers to germany&apos;s first line strength as compared with the British first line strength of 800-850 aircraft.   This undoubtedly indicates that the German airBEfiMllCP.  90 (55).COPY NO.Uforce
force te:S be on expanded to a point considerably in excessd -Of the estimates which we were able to place before the House last year, and. that is a grave fact of which we have taken immediate notice,     The Government repeat the declaration that we will not accept any position of inferiority in air power to any country wi/chiii striking distance of our shores; the necessary decisions have already been reached to make this declaration geod and measures will be taken to implement that policy in the new conditions that have arisen^     It will not be desirable to use the Debate today as the occasion for further details, as it is intended very shortly to provide a further occasion, when the more technical aspects of this matter may have to be gone intoo     But the Government takes the earliest opportunity, at the opening of the present Debate, to state publicly that the Lord President&apos;s declaration will be fulfilled and that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have already taken, steps for the purpose of ihfj necessary expansion and acceleration of the.British air force as well as for the reconsideration of the organisation of output which this expansion may require.n2*     A second matter on which Cabinet authority seems to be needed is the following:The prospects of negotiating and concluding the proposed Air Pact between the Locarno Powers is likely to bulk large in the Debate;   indeed* if agreement could be reached on a basis of parity between Germany, France, Italy and ourselves this would appear to be the condition on which an Air Pact is possible.     The Stresa Resolution included an agreement between ourselves,. Prance and Italy, confirming the idea of an Air Pact as envisaged in the London-communique of February 5rd and., agreed-to the-further... study of the question with the ;1 - f.   view
view to the drafting of such a Pact.     Would the Cabinet approve of the insertion of a passage in the opening speech on Thursday which coupled the possibility of agreement limit-ing the air forces of the four Powers on the basis of parity with the further promotion of negotiations for an Air Pact? Up to the present Cabinet authority has been given to the idea of the Air Pact only as part of a general settlement which would include the Eastern Pact, the Austrian Pact and general armament limitation,     The French have hitherto been disposed to take the same view of the interdependence of all parts of the general settlement.,     The Stresa Resolutio did not pronounce one way or the other on this inter-dependence.     But it seems to me that if cautious language is chosen there would be a good deal to be said for advancing the view that, provided that agreement could be reached between the four Powers as to their respective air strengths;, the prospects of reaching agreement on the Air Pact would be materially improved, and that we ought to be prepared to contemplate this (assuming that we can carry the others along with us) without making the Air Pact depend upon these other matters.     Otherwise our House of Commons declaration is nothing more than a declaration that we are prepared for an unlimited competition in armaments and the possibility of an Air Pact is ruled out because of Mr. Litvinov&apos;s insistence on a form of Eastern Pact v/hich we know that Germany will not accept.FOREIGN OFFICE.50th April, 1955.
