MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE ON DEFENCE, REQUIREMENTS.Second Interim Report by the Sub-Committee on Air Parity.I. Introduction.AT their 62nd Meeting on the 10th May, 1935, the Ministerial Committee on Defence Requirements agreed (i) &quot; to recommend to the Cabinet that the Air Ministry should be authorised to proceed with the programme so far as it referred to fighter and light bomber aircraft, subject to the normal financial procedure between the Air Ministry and the Treasury; (ii) to instruct the Sub-Committee on Air Parity to examine in detail the proposals in the programme for the production of heavy and medium bombers with a view to the acceleration, if possible, of the most modern types.&quot;2. In accordance with the above instructions we have had two meetings and discussed the matters at issue in detail with representatives of the Air Ministry.3. The proportion of different types of aircraft, their relative value and lighting efficiency are clearly matters on which a civilian committee are unfitted to adjudicate and on which the considered opinion of the Air Council must be accepted. We have therefore felt that our task was to present the best programme they can produce, to explain the reasons given to us for the contents of that programme and to satisfy ourselves as far as possible, first, that the programme is justified in the circumstances existing to-day, and, secondly, that it is within the competence of the industry to produce.II. Details of the Proposed Programme.4. In the time available for the preparation of our first interim report it was not possible to work out the proportion of various categories of aircraft included in the general total of 1,512 first-line strength. Proposals on this head have now been worked out by the Air Ministry and a tabular statement is attached at Appendix A of this Report.5. It will be seen that a total of 70 bomber squadrons is suggested, i.e., 20 heavy bomber, 20 medium bomber, and 30 light bomber squadrons (of which latter 11 will be non-regular).6. Our discussion on the question of the above allotment centred round the number of light bomber squadrons, and the possibility of their curtailment, with corresponding increase to heavier types. If that were thought desirable and found possible, an increase in our offensive power might be expected to result.7. It was represented to us, however, that the total figure of 30 light bomber squadrons had been arrived at after a number of factors had been weighed. In the first place, production of this category of aircraft will be quicker than that of heavier types. It is a type, moreover, that is suitable for the purpose of oversea reinforcement in the Middle East, India, &amp;c, a matter which cannot be entirely disregarded. It is particularly suited for the equipment of non-regular squadrons, whose personnel, like all others, start their instruction on the lighter kinds of aircraft, and have not the time necessary for more advanced instruction in heavier types.8. As suggested in the preceding paragraph, the requirements of Imperial Defence as a whole must be considered, although it is realised that the needs of Home Defence must, at the present time, be the predominant factor. It is the light bomber, in particular, which is required for general service overseas, and the Home Defence Air Force has always been regarded, and rightly, as an Imperial Reserve in case of necessity.
9. The proportion between the various types is, of course, a matter of judgment; the light bomber has certain advantages in the matter of speed and in capacity for carrying out diving bombing attacks. We noted that the actual increase in light bomber Squadrons under the new programme was 5 (of which 3 are for non-regular squadrons); this compares with proposed increases of 12 heavy bomber and 10 medium bomber squadrons over programmes already approved.10. It is the considered opinion of the Air Ministry that the proportions of bomber squadrons, as divided between heavy, medium and light, should be accepted as proposed.11. Of other types of aircraft, a total of 35 Fighter, 5 Army Co-operation, 7 General Purpose and 6 Flying Boat Squadrons are suggested, making a total, with the bomber aircraft referred to above, of 123 service squadrons, of which 16 will be non-regular, with 1,512 first-line aircraft.III. New Types.12. Further to the consideration of types of aircraft referred to in paragraph 31 of our first interim report (D.C.M. (32) 141), we have investigated in detail the various types of aircraft now in use, and those which can be made available in sufficient quantities by the 31st March, 1937. The results of our investigations are summarised below : Fighters.13. Trials are being carried out with a new G-loster Fighter with a new engine. This aircraft has proved satisfactory with an engine of lower power. The new engine, it is anticipated, will give an additional speed of 25 miles per hour over the latest type now in the Service, i.e., the Gauntlet. Thus a speed of 255 miles per hour is anticipated.It is expected that deliveries of the New type Gloster (i.e., F.7/30 referred to above) might begin in the middle of 1936.14. The firms of Hawker and Supermarine are, we are informed, designing low wing monoplanes with retractable undercarriages, flaps for slow landing, and an estimated speed of 300 m.p.h. Prototypes may be expected in July and October 1935 respectively. In the case of these types, however, the Air Ministry anticipate that trouble may be experienced, owing to the fact that they are low wing monoplanes, and difficulties must in consequence be expected.15. It is unsound, in view of these possible difficulties, to count on them for the two-year programme, but if the tests are satisfactory, orders could, and we think should, be placed for some of these types. But we should still have to-complete the full programme, as in Appendix A, of Gloster Fighters, as we could not be certain of the new types by April, 1937.&quot;We are advised that, if the above programme is carried out, the position in regard to fighter aircraft will be relatively satisfactory.Light Bombers.16. In 1932 an attempt was made to obtain experimental machines of tha light bomber type to carry a bigger load with a bigger range. The specification, when examined by the designers, resulted in a machine not of the light bomber type, but of the medium bomber type, and is actually under construction in the form of the Fairey single-engine medium bomber referred to below. A new speci-fication has now been issued which requires a speed of from 235 to 255 m.p.h., a normal range of 600 miles, and auxiliary tanks to enable the range to be increased to 800. The bomb load will remain as at present at 500 lbs. as any attempt to increase this, in addition to the range, will produce a machine so heavy as not to be capable of use as a light bomber. The experimental aircraft will not be ready for inclusion in the programme now suggested; in these circumstances we are advised that the Hawker-Hind is a type suitable to meet the immediate require-ments of the light-bomber squadron.[11605] b 2
17. It is to be noted that the Ministerial Committee on Defence Require-ments have already recommended to the Cabinet that the Air Ministry should be authorised to proceed&apos;with their proposed programme for fighters and light bombers.Medium Bombers. ]g-18. To meet the requirements of squadrons referred to in paragraph -4, which involves the creation of 17 new squadrons (provision having already been made for 3) we require by April 1937 some 300 medium bombers, and no satis-factory type is at present available. Three possible types have been under consideration :  (1) Fairey with an anticipated performance of 250 miles per hour, normal range of 720 miles, and a bomb load of 1,000 lbs. This aircraft, we understand, will not be flying before next December.(2) Hawken this type was designed as a G.P. type for use overseas. It has a speed of 195 miles per hour, normal range of 700 miles and a bomb load of 750 lbs.(3) Specification G. 4/31 this aircraft was built for service in the East as a general purpose type and would therefore act as a replacement for squadrons abroad, but, meanwhile, would be a useful stopgap, having good fighting qualities. The anticipated speed is 165 miles per hour, normal range 800 miles and a bomb load of 1,000 lbs.Prototypes of (2) and (3) above are actually under test.19. Including the Fairey aircraft mentioned above 4 new prototypes are now under construction and are due for delivery in December 1935. 2 are single-engined and 2 are twin-engined. All will have a performance greatly in excess of prototypes (2) and (3) above. Top speeds will lie between 235 and 250 m.p.h., and ranges&apos;of or above 700 miles with a 1,000-lb. bomb load. Enquiries have been made as to the possibility of accelerating the production of these prototypes by means of double shifts or night work, but the firms maintain that the delivery date could not be advanced by more than about 6 weeks at best. Of these 4 prototypes, that designed by the Fairey Aviation Company is, in the opinion of the Air Ministry, one of the most promising, and, at a later stage in this paper, a recommendation is made that an order shall be placed for the type with-out awaiting the completion of the prototype.Heavy Bombers.20. A prototype is now under construction by Armstrongs who would, subject to the necessary orders being placed, be prepared to deliver 40 of the new type by 31st March, 1937. The anticipated performance of this type is, speed 205 miles per hour, normal range 1,250 miles, and a bomb load of 1,500 lbs.IV. Possibilities of Acceleration.21. The stages of production of an aircraft may be summarised as follows :  (a) The issue of specification.(b) The production of the design and its examination by the Air Ministry.(c) The production of the prototype which entails the building of a&apos;&apos; mock-up &apos;&apos; and the carrying out of trials in the wind tunnel preparatory to the actual building of the type.(d) The testing of the type by the Air Ministry to ascertain, firstly, whetherit meets the required specification and, secondly, its capabilities as a service aircraft.(e) Production in quantity.22. In considering the methods by which production can be accelerated the problem must be considered in two phases. Firstly, the production of the proto-type and, secondly, bulk production when the prototype has been accepted.
23. In the case of future experimental orders the Air Ministry has recently -revised the:procedure in order to shorten, the period between the inception of the specification and the completion of the testing of the prototype before putting the aircraft into production. These proposals, which have not yet been discussed with the industry, will shorten very considerably the period between inception and the selection of a type for production. In this revised procedure the Air Ministry would maintain close touch with the firms during building, but there would be no obligation on the part of the firm to accept their advice, and in consequence firms would enjoy a freer hand.In this connection, however, the Air Ministry must, of course, retain their control over alterations necessitated by the dictates of safety.24. It appears that the best way of achieving acceleration is by some departure from the existing system and by the immediate placing of orders in bulk before prototypes have been tested for certain types of aircraft which have been considered by the Air Ministry.Such a policy is taking the risk of the failure of the aircraft to come up to specification and resultant financial loss. Nevertheless, we are satisfied that ,such a policy is justified in the special circumstances.25. Our detailed proposals to this end, together with an estimate of their ^financial implications, are contained in Part V.V. Proposals for Acceleration.26. In the case of fighters and light bombers the Ministerial Committee on Defence Requirements have already recommended to the Cabinet that the Air Ministry should be authorised to proceed with the programme.27. In the case of medium and heavy bombers we make the following recommendations :  (a)  Medium Bombers.(i) that an immediate order be placed with Fairey&apos;s for the delivery by the 1st April, 1937, of 150 low-wing monoplane aircraft of the type approved by the Air Ministry, with a specification of speed-250 m.p.h., normal range 720 miles, bomb load-1,000 lbs.(ii) that an immediate order be placed with Hatoker&apos;s for the delivery by the 1st April, 1937, of such numbers as can be obtained, up to 15.0, Hawker P.V. aircraft, of the type approved by the Air Ministry, with a specification of speed 195 m.p.h., normal range 700 miles, bomb load 750 lbs.((iii) that an immediate order be placed with the selected firm for the pro-duction by the 1st April, 1937, of such numbers as can be obtained, up to 150, of the G-.4/31 type aircraft, with a specification of speed 165 m.p.h., normal range 800 miles, bomb load 1,000 lbs.The total number under (ii) and (iii) above not to exceed 250 aircraft.It will be noted that, in (i), (ii) and (iii) above, provision is made for about 400 medium bombers, and in paragraph our requirements are stated as some 300. The difference is accounted for by the fact that it is necessary to have a margin of safety in case of lack of completion of the full orders, or of a possible failure in design.In connection with (a) (i) above, we would point out that, whilst the placing of so large an order is to incur some:.risk of failure,.the
Air Ministry are satisfied that the types suggested provide the best chance of meeting the existing difficulty. In the case of the G-.4/31, it will be noted that the speed is relatively low, but the bomb load and range are satisfactory. This type and the Hawker P.V. must, how-ever, be regarded as stopgaps, and will not in any case be wasted since; they are the types suitable for the re-equipment of general purpose-squadrons overseas, in accordance with a normal replacement programme.(b) Heavy Bombers.28. That an immediate order be placed with Armstrong&apos;s for the delivery by the 31st March, 1937, of 40 of a new type approved by the Air-Ministry, with a specification of speed- 205 m.p.h., normal range 1,250 miles, bomb load 1,500 lbs.In addition it is proposed to place immediate orders for the following :  50 Hendons.140 Heyfords, or a new type, C.26/31, the first of which has just been flown.Financial implications of the above proposals.29. The general financial implications of the programme were set out in paragraphs 49 and 50 of our first Report (D.C.M. (32) 141). With regard to the special proposals now made in paragraphs 27 and 28 above for placing orders in advance of full tests, we are informed that the financial implications are as. follows : 30. The Fairey Medium Bomber and the Armstrong Heavy Bomber are still in the design stage, delivery of the prototypes being expected in December 1935 and February 1936 respectively. In order to secure deliveries of these two types before April 1937 production contracts must be placed forthwith, in order that the firms may start at once to make jigs and tools, and buy materials and start working on the materials.31. In the case of the Armstrong machine, the firm estimate that they will have to spend  40,000 on jigs and tools, together with  80,000 for materials, by February 1936. The value of the contract will probably amount to about  520,000.32. In the case of the Fairey machine, the firm estimate that  100,000 will be spent on jigs and tools, and from  150,000 to  200,000 on materials and the work to be done on the materials by December 1936. The value of the contract is-about  1,500,000.33. Both firms are confident that the prototypes will come up to the-requirements of the specifications, and, on the basis of a firm contract now, may be expected to take the risk of the failure of the type to meet the performance promised, and on that assumption no legal liability would be incurred by the Air Ministry in the event of failure. But if the prototypes are not considered satisfactory for other reasons than failure to reach the performance specified, or if there is any change of policy, the Air Ministry would have to compensate the firm for the expenditure incurred. The liability would vary according to the date when the decision was reached to stop work. In the case of the Fairejr machine it would be about  300,000 by December 1935, and in the case of the Armstrong  120,000 by February 1936. If an earlier decision were given the liability would be less; if it were later the liability would grow rapidly. The Air Ministry anticipate that they would be in a position to come to a decision as to suitability within a short time of delivery of prototypes.34.   It should be added that there is some doubt whether Messrs. Fairey will succeed in fulfilling their promise to deliver 150 Medium Bombers by the 1st April, 1937, but this will be covered by ordering additional machines of various types. against a requirement of 300 for the Medium Bomber class.
VI. Works Services.35. A general outline of the Works Services considered necessary by^ the Air Ministry to meet the proposals in the new programme is given at Appendix B.&apos; 36. The Air Ministry has located the majority of the sites for new aero-dromes and every possible effort is being made to speed up the purchase of the necessary land, but the permanent stations cannot possibly be ready until after the 31st March, 1937. We recommend that authority should be given to employ the best firm available to assist on this side of the work.37. One problem is that difficulties have arisen in connection with the Grid System, owing to the existence of main transmission and especially subsidiary transmission lines which interfere with safe flying in the vicinity of the proposed aerodromes. We consider it essential that the Electricity Commissioners should be notified at once of all sites essential for National Defence, and we recommend that they should be directed to use all their powers to assist the requirements of the Air Ministry.38. Pending the completion of the new aerodromes the new squadrons will have to be provided with temporary accommodation, where they will not be either in the right place strategically, nor in the same comfort as when the scheme is complete.VII. Personnel.39. We had before us the plans which the Air Ministry have worked out for the provision of personnel, which have already been largely agreed to by the Treasury and in which the Ministry of Labour have already been consulted. We -are informed that these proposals have been communicated to the other Service Departments.   The attached Appendix C summarises the totals required.40. It appears to us that, in the short time available, very rapid progress has been made and the plans most thoroughly worked out. It will be appreciated that an extensive recruiting campaign will be necessary to attract the numbers required. The most serious difficulty is likely to be encountered in recruiting a sufficient number of highly skilled men.VIII. Industrial Organisation.41. We have already sufficient evidence to show that difficulties will arise in the provision of aircraft and equipment required to carry out the expansion programme, including, for example, shortages of materials and machine tools. To deal with these difficulties special measures are required.42. We have already recommended that the Air Ministry should be authorised to engage additional staff and to secure accommodation for them (D.C.M. (32) 141, paragraph 47 (12)). We now recommend in particular that a special officer, with an adequate staff, should be appointed at once to become permanent Chairman of Supply Committees Nos. 5 and 6 of the Principal Supply Officers Organisation, which are already respectively responsible for the revision of the war expansion arrangements for Scientific Stores and Aircraft, Tanks, Dragons, &amp;c, under the new conditions. In addition, this officer should assist the Air Member for Supply and Organisation in the immediate investigation of the difficulties likely to arise in carrying out the present scheme.43. We recommend that, in addition to any assistance that can be given by the Principal Supply Officers Organisation, the Advisory Panel (Lord Weir, Sir Arthur Balfour and Sir James Lithgow) should be invited, individually or collectively, to assist the Air Ministry as required.44. The Air Ministry should work in close co-operation with the Board of Trade for the purpose of overcoming the anticipated difficulties, and the Board of Trade, if they require further support, should refer to the Air Parity Committee.
IX. German Pilots.45. With reference to paragraph 11 of our previous report, we have: considered further the estimates of the numbers of German pilots. The estimate of approximately 1,100 trained military pilots is not in dispute. We think it is impossible to offer any definite opinion on the number of other pilots. Conflicting estimates are based on different hypotheses. If the Germans have concentrated on giving extensive training to a limited number of pilots, the^ number may be in the region of 4,000. If, on the other hand, they have given a small amount of flying training to as many members of their civil flying schools and clubs as their machines could accommodate, the number may be much greater, although the amount of training given in that event would not make these persons at all efficient pilots. In this regard, it is interesting to observe that Dominion experience coincides with our own in considering that the man who has only had a small amount of flying training is of little use when he first enters an Air Force. Either of the above hypotheses may be correct, or the path may lie somewhere between the two. In the circumstances, we think it is impossible to arrive at any certain conclusion, and we would strongly recommend that no estimate should be given in public.Summary of Conclusions.(i) We recommend that the programme of the Air Ministry, in the-proportions and numbers set out in this report, should be adopted and that authority should be,given to them to place the necessary orders so as to ensure the earliest possible production during the period under review.(ii) The only way of achieving acceleration of delivery is by some departure from the existing system, and by the immediate placing of production orders, before prototypes have been tested, for certain types of aircraft. This entails some risk of failure, but we are satisfied that such a policy is justified in the special circumstances, and we recommend that this should be adopted (paragraph 24).(iii) The detailed measures for implementing conclusion (ii) above are described in paragraphs 27 and 28, their financial implications in paragraphs 29 to 34.(iv) We recommend that authority be given to employ the best firm available to assist the Air Ministry in the acquisition of land for the provision of aero-dromes, and also that the Electricity Commissioners should be notified of all sites essential for national defence, and that they should be directed to use all their powers to assist the Air Ministry (paragraphs 36 and 37).(v) We recommend that authority should be given for the Air Ministry to-&apos; proceed with their recruiting plans (paragraphs 39 and 40).(vi) We recommend the appointment of additional staff to the Air Ministry to assist in the provision of aircraft and equipment. A special officer should be nominated as Permanent Chairman of Supply Committees Nos. V and VI of the Principal Supply Officers Organization in addition, the co-operation of the advisory panel under Lord Weir should be invited (paragraphs 42 and 43).Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,P.
