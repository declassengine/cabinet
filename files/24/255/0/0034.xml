THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1935.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 119 (35)TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.ANGLO-GERMAN NAVAL DISCUSSIONS.Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs.HERR von RIBBENTROP and the other members of the German Naval Delegation, whom we invited to come here after the visit to Herr Hitler for the purposes of preliminary consultation, have been in London this week. At the opening of the Conference the German representatives invited His Majesty&apos;s Government to recognise the decision announced by the German Chancellor laying down for the future a relationship between the German fleet and the British fleet in the proportion of 35 100.. The meaning of this proposal was investigated in subsequent meetings and has been the subject of very careful examination by the Admiralty. As a result the British representatives reported to the Ministerial Naval Committee in the terms annexed (N.C.M. (35) 50) and the Committee authorised me to intimate to the German representatives the acceptance of the proposal. The First Lord and I accordingly saw Herr von Ribbentrop and his colleagues yesterday afternoon and agreement was confidentially reached. We explained that before giving our formal reply, His Majesty&apos;s Government must communicate with the other parties to the Washington Treaty and give them the opportunity of offering any observations. What we are communicating is our decision to accept the arrangement which will be a perpetual one and which Germany expressly states will not be varied even though Germany should hereafter acquire colonies or if the construction of third Powers should be altered.I annex a copy of the telegram which has been sent to the other capitals.J. S.Foreign Office, June 7, 1935.7989   [11696]
SECRET.N.C.M. (35) 50.ANNEX I.Naval Conference, 1935.ANGLO-GERMAN NAVAL DISCUSSIONS.Report by the British Representatives.1. IN the course of the meetings held yesterday and to-day, the German naval representatives made it clear that, before proceeding with further naval discussions, they would like to know whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared &quot; to give a clear and formal recognition of the decision taken by the German Government laying down a relationship between the British and German fleets in the proportion of 100 per cent, to 35 per cent.&quot; The German repre-sentatives explained that the German Government would regard this ratio, if accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, as &quot; final and permanent,&quot; and that the subsequent possession of colonies would not modify it.2. In the course of the discussions the German representatives gave the following important clarifications of their proposal: (a) Once agreement had been reached between Great Britain and germany on a ratio of 35 per cent., the German Government would adhere to this limitation independently of the construction of third Powers. As an example it was stated that if, for instance, France should decide to increase the proportionate strength of the French navy to the British navy, and His Majesty&apos;s Government were to decide not to respond to this by increasing British construction, Germany would likewise adhere to a level of 35 per cent, of the British fleet.(b) At the same time, the German representatives stated that they assumed that, in the event of France deciding to make any considerable increase in her naval strength, the British Government would do their best to deter her from taking this course.(c) The German Government would not insist on the incorporation of thisratio in any future international treaty, provided that the alternative method eventually adopted for the future limitation of naval armaments gave Germany full guarantees that this relationship between the British and German fleets would be maintained.(d) The  German  Government believe in the system of limitation bycategories, and they are prepared in principle to calculate the 35 per cent, ratio on the tonnage in the separate categories, any variation from this ratio in a particular category being dependent upon the arrangements to this end that may be arrived at in a future general treaty of naval limitation. Should no international treaty be concluded, or should the question of limitation by categories not be dealt with in a future international treaty, the question of the calculation of the 35 per cent, ratio in the categories would be a matter for discussion between the German and British Governments.3. The text of the German declaration on this point, of which the relevant passages will be found in paragraph 2, sub-sections (2) and (3), is attached as Annex I.4. The German representatives fully recognised that, owing to the present domestic situation here, the answer of His Majesty&apos;s Government might be slightly delayed. They pointed out, however, that there had been a certain disappointment in Germany that His Majesty&apos;s Government had not felt able to accept more promptly what the German Government regarded as an offer of the
highest historical importance, under which a sovereign State voluntarily, agreed in advance to accept a permanent naval inferiority of 65 per cent, as compared with the British Fleet, and for this reason it was important that the answer should be delayed as little as possible. It would be particularly appreciated if the answer could be returned before Whitsuntide. An extract from the British record, giving the text of Herr von Ribbentrop&apos;s observations on this point at to-day&apos;s meeting, is attached as Annex II.(The foregoing paragraphs have been submitted to the German repre-sentatives, who agree that they correctly represent the view of the German Government.)5. The British representatives fully explained to the German representatives the difficulties in the way of the course they suggested, pointing out in particular that, even were His Majesty&apos;s Government prepared to accept such a relationship in so far as the British Navy was concerned, there remained the question of the repercussions on the other naval Powers, with whom there was a tacit under-standing that, in advance of any international conference, there should be no bilateral agreements during the present conversations. The fact that the whole essence of the British proposal was to do away with the element of ratio and to substitute voluntary declarations of programme was also stressed. Despite these arguments, the German representatives declared that it was essential for them to learn at the outset whether His Majesty&apos;s Government were or were not in a position to proceed on this basis.6. The British representatives have since had time to consider this proposal carefully, and they are definitely of the opinion that, in our own interest, we should accept this offer of Herr Hitler&apos;s while it is still open. They are confident that, if we now refuse to accept the offer for the purposes of these discussions, Herr Hitler will withdraw the offer and Germany will seek to build up to a higher level than 35 per cent. A Naval Staff memorandum dealing with the strategical aspects of the question is attached as Annex III.7. It is true there may be a certain element of bluff in these proceedings, but it is felt at the same time that, in view of Herr Hitler&apos;s action in regard to land armaments, it would be a mistake to believe that such an offer on the part of Germany will remain indefinitely open in the absence of a British acceptance of it. . Having regard to past history and to Germany&apos;s known capacity to become at will a serious naval rival of this country, it is felt that we may have cause to regret it if we fail to take this chance of arresting German naval development at the level stated.8. Even, however, if His Majesty&apos;s Government, for their part, were prepared to accept this offer, they have to consider the repercussions on other European Powers and also whether such acceptance would not be a breach of the tacit understanding which has governed our discussions with those Powers, namely, that there should be no bilateral agreements between any of the Washington Naval Powers in advance of any general naval conference.9. This German offer is of such outstanding importance that it would be a mistake to withhold acceptance merely on the ground that other Powers might feel some temporary annoyance at our action. It is, however, both desirable and necessary that we should give the Governments of those Powers with whom we have had previous naval conversations an opportunity to express their view on the point before we give a formal answer to the Germans. It is therefore proposed that we should as soon as possible address an oral communication to the United States, Japanese, French and Italian Governments in the following general sense: 10. After informing them of the nature of the German offer, we should state that we consider that it is a contribution of great importance to the cause of future naval limitation and also furnishes an important assurance for the future security of this and other countries. We should emphasise points (a) and (c) mentioned in paragraph 2 above and say that we intend accordingly to recognise this decision of the German Government as the basis of our future discussions between the British and German naval representatives in London. Before, how-ever, giving our formal reply to the German representatives we should be glad to[11696]b 2
learn whether the Governments concerned desire to furnish any observations, and in view of the urgency of the matter we trust that we may receive their observations in the course of the next few clays.11, It is believed that if the German representatives could be informed confidentially, either on Thursday or Friday, that it was our intention to make the above communication to the other interested Powers they would be content and the discussions could proceed on a satisfactory basis. There is, in fact, every reason to believe that, once this difficulty is out of the way, there is a good prospect of the British and German representatives finding themselves in agreement on all other points.12. It may be thought that His Majesty&apos;s Government are being asked to take too hurried a decision and that the matter should wait over until after Whitsuntide. The German representatives quite anticipate that such course may be necessary, but at the same time they would regret the necessity because of the misunderstanding which it would create. In the view of the British representa-tives it would be unfortunate both from a political and psychological standpoint if the German representatives returned to Germany for Whitsuntide under the impression that His Majesty&apos;s Government are still hesitating as to whether or not the German proposal can be accepted. It is obvious, of course, that the effect of an acceptance of the German offer will decrease in proportion to the length of time that His Majesty&apos;s Government take to consider it, and this is particularly the case in view of the confident expectation of the German Government that the acceptance of His Majesty&apos;s Government would have been forthcoming very shortly after the offer was made publicly in Herr Hitler&apos;s speech of the 21st May.June 5, 1935.ANNEX I.Extract from the Statement made by Ambassador V. Ribbentrop at the Openingof the Naval Talks.The German Government have welcomed the invitation addressed to them by His Majesty&apos;s Government to hold a meeting between British and German representatives on naval questions to prepare the ground for a future general settlement of naval strengths. The German Government believe that such a meeting can essentially promote the realisation of the common aim, viz., to prevent a naval armaments race among the nations of the world, and they are convinced that a friendly understanding on naval armaments between our two countries would furnish a very valuable contribution towards the realisation of this aim. We believe to be at one with the British Government in the serious endeavour to bring about such an agreement, and Ave hope that these endeavours will be successful.With a view to creating the conditions necessary for a successful conclusion of these conversations, the German Delegation feel bound to make the following statement before entering into the discussions : (1) In the speech which the German Chancellor made in the Reichstag on the 21st May he declared : &quot; The German Government consequent on the failure of the other States to fulfil their disarmament obligations have on their part renounced those articles of the Versailles Treaty, which, because of the one-sided burden this laid on Germany contrary to the provisions of the Treaty, have constituted a discrimination against Germany for an unlimited period of time. By this declara-tion, which was made by the German Chancellor subsequent to the introduction of conscription, Germany has re-established her unconditional equality in matters of military sovereignty.(2) The necessity for protecting Germany and her maritime communications on the one hand, and the recognition of Great Britain&apos;s historic claim
to naval supremacy on the other hand, led the German Chancellor to fix the German requirements of warship-tonnage at 35 per cent, of the British total tonnage. The German Chancellor could not have contemplated this voluntary limitation, by a sovereign State, of its naval defence if he had not, once and for ever, excluded Great Britain as a possible enemy from all considerations of German defence.The German Government express the hope that this broad-minded decision of the Chancellor will be fully appreciated as a German contribution of the greatest historic importance toward the future development of the relations between our two countries and the pacification of Europe. (3) In these circumstances it should be superfluous for the German Delegation to point out that they can only hope for success of such negotiations, and that they can only enter into these conversations, which they think would be extremely useful, if the British side recognise also for their part the ratio 100/Great Britain: 35/Germany as an unalterably fixed relation. But in order to avoid, from the very outset, any possible misunderstanding on this point, the German Delegation would be very grateful to the British Delegation for a confirmation as to the agreement on this principle.The advantages which such a permanent settlement of the naval problem would involve for our two countries cannot be over-estimated.A senseless naval rivalry between the two countries, which is justified by no political necessity, and which would only involve further tremendous financial burdens and necessarily produce a fresh estrangement between our two nations, would be definitely excluded.Great Britain&apos;s naval supremacy, which is an indispensable and vital necessity for your country, and which Germany fully recognises, would be secured, as well as German naval defence requirements.The German Chancellor furthermore declared that Germany would consider this ratio as final and permanent, and that the possession of colonies would not alter it.But it was not these considerations alone which led the German Chancellor to this broad-minded self-limitation. With great foresight and in anticipation of unavoidable future developments, the German Chancellor has reached certain conclusions which have influenced his political convictions for years, and which are, to-day, corner-stones of his political conceptions, viz :  (1) That a recurrence of the unprecedented conflict of arms between the two great nations of the same race must be avoided, on any condition.(2) That, ultimately, only an adjustment of vital interests of our two: countries and a common realistic attitude towards the great European problems can produce a solution of these problems, and, in particular, a Franco-German settlement, which the German people desires, and without which Europe will not come to rest. Such an all-round adjustment would place the solidarity of European nations, which is so necessary, at last on a solid foundation, on which the work of reconstruction could be begun. If such a foundation, one might almost call it a nucleus of common European interests, is once found, it will not be difficult for the nations to choose between chaos on the one hand and reconstruction on the other. Then there will be that co-operation which alone can secure the existence of Europe, and guarantee the present order of the world as the foundation of our culture.The German people and the Fiihrer would be glad if His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment gave their serious consideration to these ideas, with which Germany, in her special situation, has had to occupy herself more than other countries, and would not lose sight of these important and decisive considerations.I think that, if we approach our problems in this spirit, we shall find many points of common interest also in naval matters, and I should be happy if I could report to the German Chancellor on my return to Berlin that good progress has been made on the way to the consolidation of Europe and the world.[11696] B 3
ANNEX II.Naval Conversations between British and German Representatives,June 5, 1935.Herr von Ribbentrop&apos;s Closing Remarks.Herr von Ribbentrop said he did not want to press unduly for an early reply and he would be willing to give the British Government time to come to their decision. At the same time he again expressed disappointment that Herr Hitler&apos;s historic decision should have caused a delay, but in view of the impending changes in His Majesty&apos;s Government he would, of course, wish to allow for ample time.He would agree to a meeting being held to-morrow in order to avoid difficulties-ties with the press, at which Admiral Little should expound the details of the British position. But he was not in favour of a Sub-Committee meeting and would prefer a plenary meeting of the whole commission.For reasons which he had explained privately to Mr. Craigie the evening before, he thought it would be good for as early a reply as possible to be made. He hoped for an agreement in principle before Whitsuntide, so that after Whit-suntide there would be time for clearing up points of detail. The German delegation would return to London for three or four days after Whitsuntide for this purpose.If, however, there was no reply before Whitsuntide, difficulties would arise, as arrangements would have to be made in Germany which might entail a delay of some weeks. He, therefore, hoped for an early reply and would greatly regret it if a delay of some weeks were to arise as might very well occur. It was in the interests of both delegations to avoid a delay, particularly in view of the impend-ing conference. Finally, he expressed a hope that at the conference the delegations would be 100 per cent, in agreement.ANNEX IIIGerbian Proposal for a 35 per cent. Naval Ratio.Naval Staff memorandum.The significance of the construction by Germany of a fleet of 35 per cent, of our own must be considered in relation to the general strategical situation that has to be faced.2. This was recently described by the Chiefs of Staff in their Annual Review for 1935, in the following terms  (a) &quot; The ability of the One-Power Standard to satisfy our strategicalneeds is dependent upon a sufficient margin between the strength of the one Power on which the standard is calculated and the strength, of the next strongest naval Power. The existing margin is only sufficient on the supposition that France will not be our enemy in Europe and that we are not without allies.&quot;(b) &quot; That we should be called upon to fight Germany and Japan simul-taneously without allies is a state of affairs to the prevention of which our diplomacy would naturally be directed. With France as our ally the naval situation in Europe would wear a different complexion and the main British fleet would be available to defend our Empire in the East.&quot; -(c) &quot; Although His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would never, we presume, confide the entire protection of this country and its vital sea communications to a foreign navy in the absence of our
Main Fleet, yet if France were our ally, her naval forces could under-take part of this responsibility. A British capital ship cruiser and destroyer strength in home waters equal to that of Germany is probably the least that we could accept.&quot; -(d) &quot;It would be important to have sufficient warning to enable us to bring forward our capital ships undergoing large repairs before we were called upon simultaneously to face Germany in European waters and send our Main Fleet to the Far East. Subject to this proviso, and, except for the shortage of cruisers, we should, in the next three or four years, be able to provide naval security in an alliance with France against Germany, while at the same time defending ourselves against Japanese aggression.&quot;3. At the present time Japan&apos;s total naval strength by tonnage is about 64 per cent, of ours, and Germany&apos;s is less than 11 per cent. In the vital matter of capital ships, the percentages are 57 per cent, and 15 per cent., so that at the moment the margin is ample. If, when Germany has reached a strength of 35 per cent, of our own, as is her announced intention, Japan&apos;s relative strength remains the same as at present, we should, on a purely tonnage basis, have a margin sufficient to fulfil the requirements set out in paragraph 2 (c).4. Since our strategical requirements must take account of both Germany and Japan, it is evidently to our advantage that the naval forces of each or either iof them should (a) Be limited.(b) Be limited at as low a figure as it is possible to secure.5. The statements of Herr Hitler, as amplified by the German representa-tives in the current conversations, make it clear that there is no prospect whatever &apos;of Germany coming to agreement on any question, including the extremely important one of qualitative limitation, except on the 35 per cent, basis.The German representatives have made it clear also that they are prepared to preserve this strength relative to British strength whatever France or any &quot;Other country may do.6. We have also received the impression that the German Government genuinely consider that they have made a generous and self-sacrificing decision, and that if the opportunity to close with the offer is lost, it is improbable that they will stop short at the 35 per cent, level in building up their fleet.7. Our inf onnation leads us to suppose that the German resources are amply sufficient to enable them to complete the whole of the tonnage necessary to bring them up to this level by the year 1943, and that they have made arrangements for manning the fleet as it is constructed.8.   The foregoing represents the ultimate position, stated in general terms. There are, however, other aspects of the matter which necessitate more detailed examination.   As stated in the body of this report, the German representatives have declared that Germany intends to calculate her tonnage in principle by categories.9. In the first place the capital ship modernisation programme that has been undertaken by Japan has already made us relatively weak in modern or modernised ships. Until the middle of the year 1939 we shall, except for a short period, have only 11 ships available for service and, quite apart from the German hattle-fleet, we shall have no margin in modernised ships over Japan alone.10. From this point of view it is important that every endeavour should he made to slow down the rate of increase of the German fleet.11. Germany at present possesses three ships of the Deutschland Class, a type of capital ship, which, although small, cannot be opposed ship for ship by existing cruisers. In addition, Germany is building two further ships which it is believed will be improved and enlarged Deutschland Class of 20,000 tons or over.
12. A 35 per cent, ratio of the British tonnage in the capital ship category would permit Germany to lay down two further capital ships of the maximum size.13. Thus, when the programme under consideration is completed, we shall be faced with a German battle fleet of seven ships, of which four may be of the most powerful type allowed. During this same period Japan may have completed four new capital ships (assuming they are content with the programme suggested unofficially by Admiral Yamamoto).14. Against this total of eight new large capital ships plus three Deutschland Class, the tentative British programme will only produce six ships. In these circumstances it may be essential for the Naval Staff to recommend a more rapid replacement of the British battle fleet, in order to ensure that in neiv ships the British Fleet does not fall behind the capital ship strength of Japan and Germany combined.15. This is a position which cannot be avoided by refusing to recognise the-German decision and indeed such a refusal is more likely to lead to an acceleration-tion of the German programme with consequent disadvantage to ourselves. Amelioration of the position can only be brought about by persuading the Germans to increase their navy at a moderate rate. This they are unlikely to agree to do if we do not accord them the recognition for which they are asking.16. With regard to other categories of ships, on a basis of 50 cruisers the situation would be unsatisfactory. When, however, we have 70 cruisers, and supposing the German ratio to be calculated with respect to our under-age tonnage only, the position can be accepted. Our present contemplated rate of increase is sufficient to balance the probable rate of German building.17. In regard to destroyers, if the German calculation is based on our under-age destroyer tonnage, the situation would be satisfactory.18. In regard to Submarines, it was inevitable that, failing general agree-ment for the abolition of this type, Germany would ultimately acquire a right to build them. Although the German representatives have stated their intention to calculate their tonnage category by category in principle, yet they have made it clear that if other Powers are granted in a future Treaty or retain in fact the right to have parity with the British Empire in the Submarine category, Germany will expect a similar right, although she will not necessarily build up to this level-Should Germany exercise her power to build up to parity with ourselves in submarines, she could produce a formidable force of some 50 to 60 submarines (allowing for the fact that her first 12 are to be 250 tons each). This is a situation which must arouse some misgiving, but it is quite apparent from the attitude-of the German representatives that it is a question of &quot; Gleichberechtigung &quot; which is really exercising their minds, and not the desire to acquire a large-Submarine fleet. In the present mood of Germany, it seems probable that the surest way to persuade them to be moderate in their actual performance is to grant them every consideration in theory. In fact, they are more likely to build up to Submarine parity if we object to their theoretical right to do so, than if we agree that they have a moral justification.Apart from this psychological aspect of the question, the only other way to ensure a reasonable limitation of German submarine building is to keep our own tonnage as low as possible.It is in any event satisfactory to know the limit beyond which the Germans do not intend to proceed. Under these circumstances, it is considered that the situation is acceptable.19. The German decision to preserve a 35 per cent, ration vis-a-vis the British Fleet limits the German Navy to 70 per cent, of that of France, assuming that France maintains her present ratio of naval strength with us, which is about 50 per cent. In the opinion of the Naval Staff, France will be wise to accept the proposal, and in informing the French Government, as also in any subsequent naval discussions, it must be our aim to endeavour to persuade them to avoid any consequential increase of the French Fleet, as such an increase might call for similar action on our part in the event of the political situation changing.
If:-; 9   ..&apos;20.   Conclusions. (a) On general strategical grounds, a 35 per cent, ratio of our naval strengthfor Germany is acceptable.(b) The increase of the German Fleet makes it essential to preserve ourWashington Treaty ratio vis-a-vis Japan.(c) A more rapid replacement of the British battle Fleet than is visualisedin the tentative British programme, may be necessary in order to ensure that in new ships the British Fleet does not fall behind the capital ship strength of Japan and Germany combined.(d) Our present contemplated rate of increase in cruiser strength is sufficientto balance the probable rate of German building in this category.(e) In other categories there are no particular comments.&apos;,(/) From the point of view of general limitation of naval armament it would be greatly to our advantage to recognise the decision of the German Government lest the demand should be increased.
ANNEX II.Sir John Simon to His Majesty&apos;s Representatives at Washington (No. 155), Paris-(No. 140), Rome (No. 315), and Tokyo (No. 99).(Secret.   Immediate.), . ,(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, June 7, 1935.THE following oral and very confidential communication has been made to-day to the counsellor of the,United States (Trench) (Italian) (Japanese)-Embassy :-- &quot;1. At the outset of the Anglo-German naval conversations the German Government announced their decision to build in the future a fleet which, would be in the proportion of 35 for the German fleet to 100 for the British fleet.&quot;2. The German Government would also be prepared to agree:-&quot; (a) That this should be a permanent relationship between the two fleets, i.e., that the strength of the German fleet should never exceed 35 per cent, of the British fleet.&quot;(b) That they would adhere to this limitation in all circumstances, e.g., it would not be affected by the construction of third Powers.&quot; (c) That this ratio need not be incorporated in any future international treaty provided that fhe alternative method eventually adopted for the future limitation of naval armaments were to give Germany full guarantees that this relationship between the British and German fleets will be maintained.&quot; (d) That the ratio should, in principle, be calculated on the basis of the tonnage in the separate categories (i.e., not merely on the-&apos; global&apos; tonnage).&quot; Before, however, giving an undertaking in the sense of paragraph 2: above, they asked whether His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to accept this arrangement.&quot; The German offer has been carefully considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government, who have reached the conclusion that it should be accepted. They regard it as a contribution of great importance to the cause of future naval limitation, and consider that it furnishes an important assurance for the future security of this and other countries. Before, however, giving-- their formal reply to the German representatives, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad to learn whether the United States (French) (Italian) (Japanese) Government desire to offer any observations. In view of the urgency of the matter they trust that they may receive any such observations in the course of the next few days.&quot; The counsellor of the United States (French) (Italian) (Japanese) Embassy was requested to impress on his Government that this communica tion should, until further notice, be regarded as secret.&quot;The above is sent for your information and guidance.o
