PBEFATOBY NOTE.1. BEFORE entering upon a detailed statement of the Govern-menfs views on Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposals, it will be convenient to place on record a brief account of the events which led up to his recent discussions with a Committee of the Cabinet.2. The main lines of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s plan were explained to the public in. a series of speeches. The first was delivered at Bangor on the 17th January, and, speaking at Belfast on the following day, the Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to the proposals and said that, when completed, they would be examined with an open mind by the Government.3. In the course of an article published in the Press on the 1st March, Mr. Lloyd George wrote that he had sketched out schemes of productive work which would give employment to large numbers of workless people. He had worked out the details, including estimates of the numbers that would be employed and of the capital expendi-ture involved. He added that the Government had promised a careful inquiry into his proposals, but that so far he had not been asked to submit his plans or figures to the Cabinet. He declared himself ready to appear before any &apos;&apos; authentic committee&apos;&apos; which might be set up to investigate possibilities and proposals.4. On the same day the late Prime Minister, Mr. MacDonald, invited Mr. Lloyd George to send him these estimates and calcula-tions, saying that they would be considered immediately and care-fully by the Cabinet. He explained that the Government were at that time engaged in considering certain proposals of a like character, but would welcome further suggestions.5. On the 14th March Mr. Lloyd George transmitted to the late Prime Minister a lengthy note, which was at once placed in the hands of an existing Committee of the late Cabinet for examination and discussion with its author in person.6. A first perusal of this document, which occupied more than 40 foolscap pages of print, showed that it covered a wide field, but that it by no means bore out Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s description of it in his published article. Instead of detailed plans, the Committee found broad generalisations upon various spheres of policy; estimates of the numbers that would be employed where given appeared to be based in considerable measure on hopeful prophecies, while the capital expenditure likely to be incurred was stated with precision only for a minority of the suggestions.7. The suggestions themselves were largely unrelated to one another and it was obvious that, if they were to be properly analysed, they must be treated separately. Accordingly, the Committee suggested and Mr. Lloyd George agreed that the paper should be discussed with him under the following heads, in the order in which they are placed : 1. Preliminary.2. Agriculture, including land drainage and land settlement. 3. roads, railways and electrification. 4. Housing and town planning. 5. Industrial organisation. 6. Overseas trade.7. School age, retiring pensions and shorter hours. 8. Finance.9. Machinery,   National  Development  Board  and   the   Super Cabinet.8.   As the discussions proceeded it became apparent to the Committee that the core of the proposals was to be found in the section dealing with agriculture.   Evidently Mr. Lloyd George has given his close personal attention to agriculture.   Not only are the [11860] b 2
proposals discussed at much greater length and in more detail than any others, but it is to agriculture-that&apos;he&apos;&apos;turns with greatest hope and confidence to solve the problem of the unemployed. It was therefore with v*ry special interest that the Committee considered these proposals,9. Following upon the discussions, Mr. Lloyd George has modified and revised his original document, and the statement of the Governments views which is here set out in detail was prepared for and approved by the Cabinet after the Committee had examined the final form of his proposals now made public.10. The Government have endeavoured throughout to review all Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s suggestions as possible contributions to the formulation of their future policy and to that end they have indicated some of the main lines upon which they themselves have been acting, or intend to act. It will however be understood that a review of this kind cannot be made the vehicle for a full, still less for a final, statement of Government policy. Under the conditions prevailing throughout the world at the present day, the working out of future policy must be a continuous process.
SECTION I..r-PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION ON general principles........ ;   .Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s ultimate purpose does not differ from that of the Government. The question is whether his methods are well-conceived. His scheme consists of a large number of distinct proposals, many of which involve far-reaching and indeed revolu-tionary changes in our economic, social and political system. Each needs to be weighed before the effect of the whole can be judged, and each must be judged in relation to conditions actually prevailing. Recently this country was in the throes of the greatest economic collapse of modern history. To-day under the National Government it is steadily recovering. The question is whether the proposals made can contribute effectively to the pace of recovery in its present phase or whether they might not in certain instances at any rate actually affect adversely the progress that has already been attained. Finance need be no obstacle to any sound and solid scheme.1. The Plans to adopt the name given by Mr. Lloyd George to his proposals-do not constitute a single interrelated scheme, but they are prefaced by a general statement of their aim and by a general diagnosis of present economic conditions.2. Their aim is set forth in their title: it is to reorganise and develop our national resources and to improve our national conditions. That, needless to say, is the aim also of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Government further agree that it is sound policy to &apos;&apos; utilise the depression&quot; for this purpose of reorganisation, development and improvement. It is elementary wisdom to use a period of economic change and disturbance for the purpose of preparing for the future, whether the disturbance is regarded as a temporary interruption of normal conditions or as a transition to new conditions. The general purpose of the Plans is thus the general purpose of the Government.3. Further, this agreed statement of general purpose implies agreement also on certain main principles of action. The resources of a nation are developed primarily by the skill and initiative of its citizens, by the enterprise they exhibit and the confidence they command, by their success in scientific research and invention. The conditions of a nation&apos;s life are improved mainly by the same means : by the co-operative effort of private individuals and by the continuous and little-noticed activities of local authorities. In both these spheres, a Government can at all times, and especially at a time like the present, give impetus to national progress, but it must do so by supplementing and stimulating private and local public efforts, not by displacing or retarding them. In so far as it undertakes functions which are the ordinary concern of public bodies or of private enter-prise, it must be reasonably sure that its new effort will add to the common stock. In so far as it seeks to reorganise those corporate bodies which are responsible under existing conditions for the employ-rnerit of large numbers of workers, it must have a clear idea of the advantages to be gained by such reorganisation and must count the cost of the immediate loss of employment which such reorganisation too often entails. These are the acknowledged limitations of a Government&apos;s freedom in formulating policy. If in this country Governments are sometimes suspected of being too conscious of these limitations, it is certain that the failure of many experiments initiated by the Governments of other States since 1931 has been largely due to a disregard of them; and it remains true that no great country can claim to have advanced so far as our own upon the path towards renewed prosperity.4. The general diagnosis of present economic conditions on which the Plans are professedly based is two-fold : unemployment to-day is attributed largely to the loss of external trade and to the growth of mechanical substitutes for human labour. This diagnosis is obviously not exhaustive, and it runs the risk of obscuring the actual situation with which the Government of this country has had
to deal, and still has to deal. It might serve as a partial explana-tion of Our difficulties in the ten years immediately succeeding the Armistice, but it virtually ignores the fact that the history of the last six years has been the history of a crisis within a crisis.5. This inner crisis began in the autumn of 1929 with the Wall Street collapse. A depression of unparalleled intensity then swept over the world, and, as a pivotal centre of international trade and credit, this country was peculiarly exposed to the cumulative impact of that depression. Export trades already nagging quickly declined. The balance of our imports - and exports overseas went heavily against us. Internally, too, this country was suffering in 1931 from unbalanced finances and from lack of confidence; our prestige in foreign eyes was gravely impaired. Falling markets and failing prices sapped activity. In the end our economy cracked under the strain. In September of that year, the figures of the live register showed nearly three million men and women workless, Through distrust abroad of our recuperative power the pound was driven off gold.6. Clearly, the supersession of human labour by the machine offers no explanation of this collapse, and loss of external trade was a consequence of the conditions prevailing abroad. Other countries, including some of our most important customers, lost much of their power to buy. This loss of power was expressed in a growing net-work of restrictive regulations which had little in common with the protectionist policies of the preceding ten years, They were panic measures which already in 1931 were drying ,up the streams of our external trade, and have since grown steadily more elaborate and more intense.7. These were the conditions that the present Government inherited. Inheriting them, the Government have had, and still have, a triple task. They must restore shattered confidence; they must develop the home market while the markets of the world are closed; they must prepare the nation to take quick advantage of an eventual revival of international trade and to re-assume the historic part which our people have played in the commercial world, as a gx-eat exporting community.8. It is important to emphasise the significance of this third task, for though loss of external trade occupies a large place in Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s diagnosis, a revival of external trade is given only a comparatively minor place in his Plans.9. Much has changed since the war. In the new era on which we seem to be now entering, the world may never recover that. freedom of international exchange which was the characteristic of the nineteenth century. In the future our overseas markets may well lie rather in the countries of the Empire and in. other countries now closely associated with us in trade. But whatever changes we may thus have to face, stubborn facts deny that this country can maintain a full standard of life if it is insulated against trade contacts with countries overseas. In this small and densely populated island We can never grow all of the food we need, and we lack many of the raw materials for our industries. A country thus bound to import must export correspondingly. We have grown great as a nation mauu-facturing finished goods for export, and many of our people have migrated into the distant countries of the Empire, where they are producing the commodities we need in exchange for others which-we can best supply. By our seafaring character we have become the great sea-carrying nation. By our credit we have become &apos;the chief money centre and the chief trading mart of the world. No solution of our problems can be found in any effort to make ourselves narrowly self-supporting.10. As the policy of the present Government, has been directed towards three great tasks; it has had three mam,phases. In the first phase, up to the mid-summer of 1932, the worst ravages of the. crisis were repaired. At the cost of severe sacrifices, borne by all sections of the community-sacrifices happily now no longer required; the finances of the nation were solidly restored. By tariffs, home industry was rendered secure and capable of expansion, and imports and exports were brought to a true relation; the excessive flow of money
abroad was checked. The foundations were laid for a system of cheap .and&apos; plentiful money,&apos; as an essential: impetus. :to reviving &apos;trade. Confidence was re-established. Foreign observers, who had a few months- previously thought that they could-observe in a once&apos; great country the symptoms of final decay, discovered that; first among the leading nations, that country had. found itself again.   ,, .-: ,,   ,11. The second phase, for which the first was a preparation, was inaugurated by the great Conversions, headed by the Conversion, of the.War Loan in July 1932. Cheap-money.to finance the short-term needs of business had already been established. By these operations it. was rendered even cheaper. The rate of interest on. long-term borrowings for business purposes was brought instantly down. Thus enterprises previously unprofitable -became lucrative; as a single instance, a hew era in the development of housing enterprise was opened up. Production increased first, the production of capital goods, then the production of goods for the ordinary consumers needs. Employment rose; depressed trades returned to the dividend list and engaged more hands, and as quickening enterprise increased the general purchasing power, the community took new hope.12. At the same time, the Ottawa Agreements and commercial agreements negotiated with foreign countries opened new avenues of overseas trade. The index of production in manufacturing industries which, in 1932, stood at 97-2 as compared with 100 for 1924, rose in 1934 to the record figure of 117-4. The excess of exports over imports of wholly or mainly manufactured goods, which was  48 millions in 1931, rose to  130 millions in 1932, to  142 millions in 1933 and to  144 millions in 1934. The resulting improvement in the yield of national taxation led directly in the spring of 1934 to the remission of the main part of the burdens imposed three years before. Some 850,000 more men and women had by that time been absorbed into employment.13. In the third phase, the phase in which we are now working, it has been the business of the Government both to consolidate and to extend the progress thus achieved. No single outstanding measure, such as.the Conversion scheme, holds the stage, but the remainder of the special burdens imposed on the citizen during the crisis have been substantially remitted, and the employment figures show that at no time in-our history have so many people been at work as are at work to-day.14. This brief survey gives but a bare indication of the main trend of Government policy. Other features of that policy will be mentioned in the following pages. The results achieved certainly afford no ground, for self-complacency. Very much still remains to be done far less, indeed, than in other countries but still very much. In the present phase of our policy, progress is admittedly slower and more arduous than in the first rebound from crisis conditions. To some extent, this is inevitable; the world has not yet emerged from the intensified crisis of the past six years, and we have reached the point where our further national recovery is largely dependent on the recovery of other nations. But to some extent our rate of progress may be at least temporarily increased by a wise policy of development and reform stimulated or assisted by the Government.15. And, for this purpose, we enjoy one advantage in particular resulting from our past policy. Money is plentiful. There is an ample supply available to be borrowed, whether on short term or long, both for the increasing requirements of normal business and for any reasonable programme of public enterprises. The Plans under examination, in their anxiety to prove that money is plentiful, use arguments some of which do not seem to the Government to be well conceived. In particular the proposal to raise a loan of the magnitude envisaged in advance of the time when it would require to be spent would involve serious financial dislocation and would be deflationary in effect. That, however, is little more than a side issue. It is certain that to-day finance need be no obstacle to- any sound and solid scheme.
SECTION II. EFFECT OF THE PLANS ON UNEMPLOYMENT.The Plans, it is claimed, would bring unemployment substan-tially to an end. It is, however, hard, to see how they could make any effective new contribution to this object.16. Before proceeding to consider the Plans in detail, there is one other general question which requires careful analysis. The Plans have a further aim beyond those stated in their title; or at least they make a further claim. It is asserted that they would substantially abolish unemployment, and Mr. Lloyd George has put it on record that this result could be achieved in some fifteen months.17. So far as concerns the more distant future, Mr. Lloyd George &apos;s hope seems clearly to be that the general improvement in our economic organisation resulting from the adoption of the Plans, and especially of the agricultural proposals, will of itself, without the intervention of State activities or the use of public funds on any abnormal scale, correct the difficulties experienced to-day and reduce unemployment to small dimensions. It is, of course, the case in this country as in others that the times through which we are passing are abnormal, and the Government, like Mr. Lloyd George, have no doubt that with the continuance of wise administration the old time prosperity of this country will return. But the question how far the Plans would contribute to this more distant object depends upon the wisdom of the Plans themselves, and as this note proceeds the view of the Government upon that matter will become clear.18. Meanwhile, the immediate question is whether the Plans would commence to reduce unemployment from the moment of their adoption and eliminate it almost at once. The importance of this question needs no emphasis. Many and various as are the experi-ments made in other leading countries to combat the effects of the economic catastrophe of 1931, not one has fulfilled such claims as this, and, indeed, not one has attained such results as those gained by the National Government by sound and well-tried means.19. The precise manner in which Mr. Lloyd George expects that unemployment will be swiftly absorbed cannot be deduced with any confidence from his document. The explanation which he subse-quently gave to the Cabinet Committee, or perhaps more strictly the record of that explanation as amended at his instance, still seems to contain ambiguities, and therefore leaves the Government in some doubt.  But the following is understood to be his general view.20. Mr. Lloyd George correctly points out that the unemployed are a changing body; only the minority of the numbers on the register at any time are subject to periods of long-term unemploy-ment; the majority are workers who pass through a short period of unemployment during the course of any year. The problem for solution is not that of finding constant work for 2,100,000 persons  the figure which Mr. Lloyd George takes as the constant figure of unemployment but might be more correctly stated as that of finding work to be taken up by different workers at different times, but sufficient in volume to provide the equivalent of constant employment for the number of workers named.21. In the Plans, so it is understood, the constant figure of 2,100,000 is reduced to 1,550,000 by leaving out 250,000 workers looked upon as unemployable, and 300,000 who would, it is claimed be eliminated from the labour market by raising the school-leaving age and providing training facilities. Work sufficient to give constant employment to some 550,000 workers would, it is suggested, be directly provided by expenditure on various public works which Mr. Lloyd George would set on foot at once, and the additional work created in other industries as the direct result of this programme, i.e., by the orders placed for materials and the necessary transport, &amp;c, would create full work in their own trades for workers now from time to time unemployed equivalent to the full employment throughout the year of roughly a further 500,000 workers. Finally, the general infusion of confidence and enterprise which Mr. Lloyd George assumes the adoption of his programme would produce would give full employ-
ment in their own trades for all other workers now from time to time unemployed, this being.the equivalent, of work throughout the year for the 500,000 workers who remain&apos; on the register after the deductions which have already been made.22. . All such estimates must be highly speculative, and. the Government doubt whether any particular measure or policy can be justified by such speculations. It is, of course, tempting to assume that paper plans will,.under the stern test of practical operation, work to pre-ordained results theoretically deduced, but experience shows that this is not always the case.. .   &apos;. ,23. One instance may be quoted, on an issue where the Govern-menfs views as to policy are to a considerable extent in agreement with those of Mr. Lloyd George. The justification for the raising of the school-leaving age must be sought in its effect on the character and on the future life of the children thus retained in school, rather than in any guess as to its immediate effect on the amount of employment available to adults which will be shown later to be very small.24. Then take the suggestion that expenditure upon public works should be embarked upon on a scale sufficient to give employment partly directly and partly on materials, transport, &amp;c, equivalent to the continuous work of over one million workers. There are no details and no estimates in the plans, but Mr. Lloyd George suggests that it should be possible to produce a sweeping scheme for the construction and improvement of roads, plans for electrification of railways, for reclamation and drainage of huge areas of land and for other works.25. The intrinsic desirability of these public works will be discussed later. For the moment the Government are concerned only to say that in their view the net employment value of these schemes would prove small and slow in coming. This disappointing result accrues from a number of converging causes.26. In the first place, Mr. Lloyd George proposes that these works should be undertaken not by the Government of the country as ordinarily understood, nor by local authorities in whose sphere they primarily fall, but under the auspices of a new organ of Government, the National Development Board. If the country is to have a new organ of Government, the respective functions of that body and of older and more established institutions must be decided. Their spheres must be marked out and interlaced on intelligible business lines. The settlement of these essential preliminaries clearly involves delay.27. Apart from this it seems to the Government to be a mis-conception to suppose that a vast quantity of valuable work lies waiting to be put in hand. In the fifteen years since 1920, some  1,200 million has been spent upon State aided or State executed public works of various kinds, and so much has been done that for a long time past good schemes which can quickly be put in hand have been hard to find. Further schemes there may be for which plans are fully prepared, and upon which a commencement could at once be made, but they are the exception. In other cases the rule which applies to ordinary business developments on a great scale applies equally to State aided public works. Careful and deliberate planning and preparation are the only preventatives of waste.28. It must be remembered, too, that (apart from legal obstacles and similar delays), works such as Mr. Lloyd George has in mind require legislation. Not only must the authority of Parliament be obtained for the financial facilities that the Exchequer is to provide, but in many instances (unless, of course, it were proposed that the authority of Parliament should be superseded by a system of decrees), the special powers required to enable the works to be carried out require the sanction of special Acts.29.   Past experience has shown that for reasons such as these it is impossible to bring into active operation a great scheme of public works unless a long interval for preparation is allowed.     Past experience also shows that, once it is seen or believed that Exchequer [11860] c
money is to be had for the asking traders and others about to engage on capital expenditure on their own account hold back to see if they can secure a subsidy from public funds. The amount of capital development on hand at any time is very large, and any lag in its execution slows up trade. For these reasons there is good ground for fear that the first effect of the announcement by the Government of their intention to embark upon extensive expenditure on capital works would be to decrease. employment rather than to increase it.80. Finally, the hope that the public works programme will create such a general spirit of confidence and enterprise as to provide the equivalent of the continuous employment of about half-a-million more hands may be tested by an earlier episode. Proposals of this kind are, of course, not new. Schemes scarcely distinguishable were suggested by Mr. Lloyd George some six years ago. At that time, in the pamphlet entitled &quot;We can conquer unemployment,&quot; he pro-posed to spend in the course of two years  145 millions on roads,  34 millions on housing,  30 millions on telephones,  31 millions on electrical development,  11 millions on London Transport a total of  251 millions, without taking account of further unspecified sums which he proposed to devote to land drainage, afforestation and similar objects. The earlier reception of these schemes gives no support to the view that their adoption now would produce such an access of confidence as to result in general industry providing out of its increased momentum additional employment for workers now only intermittently employed, equivalent in volume to the continuous work of half a million people.31. Beyond the public works programme, there is nothing in the Plans likely to have a direct effect on the amount of employment available for a substantial time to come. The ideal of the settlement of a new population on the land is recognised in the Plans themselves to be only slowly attainable over a period of years. As will be shown, there is little that is both new and valuable in the plans as affecting overseas trade, while the proposals for reorganisation of industry are actually liable to involve the disappearance of their employment for many who to-day are working. As a single instance, the closing of the less economic coal pits, which is advocated, must entail permanent unemployment for very many workers.32. In short, the Government do not feel that any real weight can be attached to the estimates of additional employment which are contained in the Plans, or indeed to any estimates that could be made on a similar basis. The flaws in the calculation are in part self-evident and in part revealed by past experience, and it is to be anticipated that the announcement of such a plan, instead of being hailed as the inauguration of a new era of prosperity, would rather be received with apprehension, and instead of causing general industry to expand, might only too probably cause it to contract.
SECTION III. AGRICULTURE. The Plan propose the settlement within a comparatively short time of half a million workers in agricultural pursuits on the land, and hope thereby to provide work for an equal number in ancillary industries. In the Government&apos;s view this object could be achieved, if at all, only at the cost of a large artificially-created increase in the price of food as well as injury to our friendly relations with the Dominions and other countries and intensified difficulties for those engaged in export trades. The Government cotdd not see their way to commit the country to so hazardous and uncertain an adventure which would require incidentally an immense expenditure of very doubtful value on preliminary ivorks.33. It is manifest from Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s memorandum that he attaches the utmost importance to his agricultural proposals both as a means of finding increased employment and for the purpose of developing the national resources. In the original document the subject was treated under no less than seventeen heads, and it may be said that it forms the backbone of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s plans, and by it they must stand or fall. At an early stage, therefore, the Cabinet Committee realised that here was the vital point, and they have accordingly examined the proposals with the utmost care and attention.34. This examination was much helped by figures which Mr. Lloyd George and his experts supplied. According to a memorandum drawn up and agreed with them, the following state-ment represents his considered view as to the possibility of increasing the home production of food. First, the elimination of unemployment would increase the consumption of home-grown produce by some  54 millions a year; second, the reorganisation of agricultural marketing, the stimulation of local growing of fresh produce, and propaganda designed to induce consumers to prefer home-grown foodstuffs to preserved imported goods would increase the consump-tion of home-grown produce by  142 millions per annum; and, finally, a further  92 millions per annum of produce now imported from abroad should be produced at home. In this way a market for additional home produce to the value at present prices of  288 millions per annum is a,rrived at, and Mr. Lloyd George estimates that this increase in production might afford employment for an additional 1,200,000 people in agriculture. This represents something more than a doubling of present output.35. In the early stages, so it is understood, Mr. Lloyd George would not expect so large an increase in consumption, nor aim at so large an increase of output. He would propose that, to begin with, the increase in home production might be such as would employ an additional 500,000 workers on the land, and taking the same propor-tions as above this would represent an additional output in this country of  120 millions a year, an increase upon present output of, say, 50 or 60 per cent.36. Forecasts and estimates are necessarily uncertain, and Mr. Lloyd George would no doubt wish, as the Government would wish, to make it clear that any calculations of this kind can only be approximate and provisional. But, subject to this, the general range of the figures is useful in reaching a judgment upon the problem. On this basis, the Government have three comments to make upon these plans.37. In the first place, the larger figure of  288 millions represents an increase in the consumption of home products which is probably impracticable under any conditions. To base a pro-gramme for increased agricultural production and employment in this country on the prospects of increased consumption pf home-grown produce by such a figure would be to invite disaster. To increase agricultural output within a short term of years by only 50 or 60 per cent, would be an achievement not approached by any country of Europe, even under the most intensive policies of agrarian develop-ment that the modern world has known.[11860]
38. In the second place, the increased output, even if practicable and even when coupled with the compulsory marketing and other measures proposed in the Plans, could not be secured unless it offered also a considerable increase of prices to the producer. It is laid down in the Plans with extreme emphasis that an increase in food prices is no part of the policy; but this apparently depends upon the assumption that, as stated in the note, if agricultural prices were brought back to near the level at which they stood in 1931 or 1932, that would be quite sufficient to ensure that agriculture could be profitably expanded. But as a matter of fact, the wholesale agricultural price index for 1931, when both wages and employment in agriculture were falling, was 120, and for 1934 (including wheat and cattle payments) 119, a difference of less than 1 per cent. To produce any appreciable effect on agricultural production or on agricultural employment, a much more substantial rise would be necessary and it is unlikely, to say the least, that the result would not be reflected in the price the consumer would have to pay.39. A further factor tending to increase prices is implied in the statement, on which Mr. Lloyd George repeatedly insisted in the course of the discussions, that foodstuffs were now being dumped into this country, and that this dumping of foodstuffs must be stopped. If, according to his own definition, dumping is the selling in this country of foodstuffs at prices below those charged in the country of origin, the exclusion of these imports, whatever the merits of such a policy, must tend to raise the prices of any of the food-stuffs which to-day are being sold to the consumer at lower rates than those prevailing in the country from which they come.40. Alternatively, the Plans seem to suggest three ways of making farming profitable without any raising of prices to the consumer: (a) concentration upon those foodstuffs that are best eaten fresh and involve a large amount of labour for their produc-tion, (b) more efficient marketing organisation, and (c) better equip-ment. On the first of these suggestions, it is perhaps sufficient to say that, whatever its value in relation to market gardening and the creation of cottage holdings for the unemployed, it is not evident how its adoption could make the industry generally more profitable or contribute materially to the attainment of aims so far-reaching as those propounded in the Plans.41. As to the second suggestion, the references to marketing organisation contained in the Plans are so vague that comment is difficult. The main impression that they convey is that arrahge-ments for the organised collection and bulk transport of produce are to be preferred to the methods of the Marketing Boards set up under the Agricultural Marketing Acts. The Government agree that the problem of agricultural marketing is crucial, and they may claim to have made important experiments in that field which are steadily being improved as experience is gained. But the Plans contain no such constructive suggestions for their improvement as could trans-form the economic conditions of the agricultural industry to the degree assumed.42. As to the third suggestion, for the better equipment of the industry, the Plans set out a large variety of works designed to secure the fullest utilisation of our soil. The first of these is land reclama-tion. There are, it is true, areas of foreshore, heath and marsh which could be reclaimed at a cost, but the land reclaimed would never give a return adequate to cover the capital outlay needed to render it cultivable. In any case, the work could only add to the number of acres under cultivation; it would not increase the profits of agricul-ture as a whole.43. The second matter referred to is land drainage, for which the document advocates liberal financial assistance not only in order to reclaim waterlogged land, but also to avert the danger, which Mr. Lloyd George regards as imminent, that more land may be driven out of cultivation by flooding. There is, of course, much work to be done in this connection, and the Government have shown their keen interest in it by making substantial grants from national funds to the
local Catchment Boards whose responsibility it is to see that the land is adequately drained. But it is not a matter in which work can he hurriedly undertaken; if money is not to be wasted, careful surveys must be made before any comprehensive works on the larger rivers can be carried out. Moreover, great as may be the value of these works to particular areas of land, they have only an indirect relation to the profitability of the farming industry as a whole.44. Recommendations are also contained in the Plans on such things as field drainage, liming, the supply and utilisation of phosphates and fertilisers, increasing supplies of good strains of grasses and clovers, and the repair or replacement of farm buildings. Re-equipment of this character would no doubt, in differing degrees in different cases, render production less costly and more efficient. Tt would tend on the whole, particularly when it takes the form of the. installation of labour-saving machines and implements, to raise the output per head. But it is clear that none of these proposals will bear the weight put upon them in -the Plans as means of greatly increasing the profitability and the employing power of the agricul-tural industry. The re-equipment schemes might, indeed, tend rather to the maintenance of the present output and the employment of fewer hands, thus aggravating the decline of agricultural employment.45. There are other passages in the note which suggest similar reflections. Generally, Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposals under these heads involve immense cost, much of which would be uneconomic, but whether they are looked at individually or collectively, the Govern-ment are quite unable to see any ground for believing that they would lead to such an increased output as Mr. Lloyd George has in mind, unless accompanied by the direct and immediate stimulus of a large increase in the price of the commodities which farmers produce.46. After considering these alternatives, we therefore come back to the issue of increased prices. Ten years ago, when farmers received for their products fully one-third more than they receive to-day, agricultural output increased slowly, but, owing in particular to the introduction of labour-saving devices, agricultural employment on the whole declined. To-day farmers would not, in fact, be prepared to increase output to anything like the extent contemplated by the employment of more hands on existing farms, unless they could be assured of returns far higher than are now obtainable and with a guarantee of permanence. An attempt to secure the result by the establishment of immense numbers of small-holdings (a course which it is understood Mr. Lloyd George would not advocate), would fail for like reasons. Exchequer subsidies sufficient to produce the necessary increased return would be quite beyond the power of the taxpayer to bear. In the Governmenfs view it is quite useless to imagine that profuse expenditure on works or equipment or altered methods of marketing will effect the object. The simple fact is that the proposal involves a great increase artificially created by the State in the cost of the people&apos;s food. How great the increase would have to be it is not possible closely to define; but two examples will show that it would certainly have to be severe. It has been estimated that, in the process of excluding  92 millions a year of foreign imports by home produce, the price of the foodstuffs concerned would inevitably rise by at least  100 millions; and if the retail price of food rose no more than to the level of 1925, food which costs Is. in the shops to-day would cost nearly Is. 5d. In fact, whatever may be his intention, Mr. Lloyd George must, in the end, choose between dear food and the complete practical failure of his plan.47. The third comment which the Government would make on these Plans is that, apart from an expected large diminution in the import of preserved foods, they contemplate, at any rate for a period, the shutting out of imports of foodstuffs to the value of  92 millions a year. This reduction of imports would affect only a limited range of commodities, but it would gravely affect a number of predominantly agricultural countries, including some of the most important parts of the Empire. For example, among the Dominions New Zealand might lose at least one-quarter of her trade, and though Australia and Canada might find some compensation for serious losses in increased
sales of animal feeding stuffs, they could not escape a severe dislocation-tion of their industries. Moreover, the proposal would exclude more than four-fifths of the exports of Denmark to this country and more than one-third of the exports of China, though in another passage of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s document proposals are made for a vast increase in our trade with that country.48. An effort to restrict the exports of Dominions and friendly foreign countries on this scale would repeat that form of severe agrarian protectionism, the growth of which on the Continent of Europe has been repeatedly criticised as one of the major factors in the curtailment of international trade and the financial difficulties of primary producing countries. Notwithstanding the serious obstacles to the general recovery of international trade, the policy of the Govern-ment has been, as far as possible, to promote the mutual exchange of goods with the very Dominions and foreign countries which would be most severely affected by these restrictions. This policy of trade agreements has already produced important results. To adopt now a policy of restricting agricultural imports on the scale suggested by Mr. Lloyd George would destroy these gains; it would fatally impair their ability and the willingness of the countries concerned to take our exports of manufactured goods, and could only result in increased unemployment in this country.49. In many countries agriculture is still struggling against the gravest odds. Disastrous falls in prices have followed upon a glut of production accompanied by a falling demand; the problem of marketing the produce of farms at all, even at utterly unre-remunerative prices, has been the constant preoccupation of statesmen and of agricultural leaders. To give one illustration the price of agricultural products in Canada had fallen in 1933 to approximately half what it was in 1926. But in this island the worst effects of the crisis have been averted. Agricultural prices (including the wheat and beef subsidies) have risen since the spring of 1932. Agricultural wages are now rising also, and the average minimum adult wage rate prevailing to-day in England and Wales is the highest ever recorded since the regulating Act of 1924 came into operation. In contrast, agricultural wages in the United States last year were little more than half their level in 1927. Meanwhile, prices of foodstuffs to the ultimate consumer in this country, as measured by the cost of living index for the past six months, were 11 points less than for the comparable period of 1931.50. Throughout this period of recovery the Government have consistently set before themselves the task of securing for farmers a reasonable price for their products, while at the same time they have encouraged the maximum supply of foodstuffs to consumers at the lowest prices consistent with that policy. The individual measures taken to this end- have been numerous and varied. The arable areas have had the advantage of the Wheat Act and of the import duty upon foreign oats, as well as of continued assistance to sugar beet growers. Customs duties have led to a substantial increase in the production of fruit, vegetables and flowers. Marketing Boards have been established for hops, pigs and bacon, milk, and potatoes, commodities which represent more than two-fifths of the total output of home agriculture. The dairying industry has also received extensive Exchequer assistance under the Milk Act of 1934. Similarly, during the progress of negotiations with the Dominions and foreign countries on a long-term policy for the live-stock industry, Exchequer assistance is being afforded to the producers of fat cattle.51. These are the aspects of agricultural policy which have engaged the first attention of the Government. It was necessary to protect the industry from the worst effects of the crisis before an extension could properly be considered. But extension has not been lost sight of, and in many directions it has already taken place. It is obviously desirable that the constant decline in the agricultural population which has proceeded for many years should be at least arrested, and the Government, during their tenure of office, have taken the essential preliminaiy steps to produce the conditions which alone will make this possible. This policy will be continued and developed, but success cannot be brought about by disregarding the obvious difficulties and dangers of too rapid expansion.
52. To sum up the objections which the Government see in Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposals : (1) The possible increase in the consumption of home products for the near future is gravely exaggerated.(2) The increase in home production at which the Plans aim in the next few years could not be attained even as a result of the costly measures proposed, and it would inevitably involve a great increase in the price of the people&apos;s food.(3) Grave injury would be done to Imperial relations and trade by the drastic restriction or dislocation of the exports of the Dominions.(4) Fatal damage would be caused to our trade with friendly foreign countries whose exports would be even more drastically curtailed.
SECTION IV. HOUSING AND TOWN PLANNING.The proposals concerning town planning and housing loould involve a complete revolution in our existing organisation and a dislocation of an industry which is fully occupied in the national task of house building. The Government can see no advantages to be derived from the suggested change which would justify them in adopting it.53. The central proposal made by Mr. Lloyd George under this head is that there should be established a Central Planning Board, the duty of which would be to survey the country as a whole and to arrive at a proper distribution of industry and, by consequence, of the housing accommodation of the industrial population, taking into account local industrial resources and facilities for transport by road, rail or otherwise.54. The underlying principle appears to be that, except in so far as the needs of the population necessitate the provision of better housing for them in central areas (and, in so far as this is concerned, Mr. Lloyd George recognises the value of the scheme embodied in the Housing Bill now before Parliament), the new housing for them should be, not so much on the outskirts of existing urban units (as it is in the case of a normal municipal housing scheme, or of housing provided in the ordinary course by the building industry), but rather in new garden cities, where both the industry and the workers employed in the industry should be established.55. It may be well in the first place to make some observations on the housing aspects of this proposal.56. The contention appears to be that there is at the moment in the country a need for the construction of two million new houses in the next few years. It would seem that these houses are to be provided by direct State action, without reference to any provision of houses which may be made by the building industry. It is laid down that it is the duty of the public to supply houses for the needs of the whole population at such rents as they can afford to pay.57. The last proposition is one which needs very careful con-sideration, since, as it stands, if adopted, it will obviously attach to the provision of housing all the difficulties attendant on fixing and administering a means test.58. There have been and are two main sources of supply of houses: building by private enterprise without financial assistance, and building by local authorities with such assistance.59. From the standpoint of employment only, the present relation of these two sources of supply may be gauged from the fact that during the year ended the 31st March last, out of the total of about 348,000 houses provided in the United Kingdom, about -292,000 houses were erected by private enterprise and 49,000 by local authorities. It is not often realised that over the whole period since house building was resumed after the Armistice up to the end of March 1935, non-subsidised private industry has provided 1,319,572 houses, nearly half of the total of 2,719,562 provided.60. From the standpoint of housing needs, two facts illustrate the position. Firstly, the Registrar-General, on the results of the 1931 census, estimated that about 1,700,000 new houses were required in England and Wales in the period 1931-1941; during the 4 years ended the 31st March, 1935, approximately one million new houses have actually been already built. Secondly, in that large total, four years&apos; output, the most remarkable feature has been the continuous acceleration of production. Thus, while 200,000 houses were built in England and Wales during the year ended the 31st March, 1932, 327,000 houses were built during the year ended the 31st March, 1985, a record number in the history of the country, and a record which is all the more striking when compared with the 130,000 houses which marked the peak output in any one year before
the war, when the population was increasing more rapidly than at present. For Scotland the figures are 13,708 for the year ended on the 31st March, 1932, and 20,851 for the year ended on the 31st March, 1935.61. The policy which has produced these results is that of abandoning a general subsidy for house construction so as to leave the building industry, free from subsidised competition, to provide a pool of houses for the general needs of the people and of concentrating the activities of local authorities working under subsidy on those special housing needs which still cannot be met in the ordinary way of business without subsidy. These special needs are the replacement of unfit houses through the slum-clearance programme, and the con-struction of new dwellings for families discovered by actual survey to be living in overcrowded conditions. It may be mentioned in passing that in the first five months of 1935 new houses for slum replacement have been sanctioned at the rate of over 7,300 a month in the United Kingdom; already, at the end of May, nearly 147,000 houses had been approved for this purpose, of which about 88,000 houses had been completed.62. The policy adopted has been framed in the light of past experience. It assigns to the building industry, the local authorities and the Government the parts in a common task which they can moat appropriately play. It is overtaking, the housing shortage in the country at a rate never before approached, and it rests on the principles best calculated to provide the maximum of employment in the industry concerned. Indeed, the industry has made striking development in the last few years, has provided a steadily increasing volume of employment, and is now producing results and providing employment on a scale hitherto unknown.63. There is mention in the Plans of a present need for at least 100,000 houses in the rural districts. This figure has been stated before, but it is unsupported by any survey or statistical evidence. In fact, when the special Housing (Rural Autho-rities) Act, 1931, was passed, the total number of houses in respect of which assistance was sought did not exceed 7,000 in England and Wales and 1,500 in Scotland, and on examination the major part of the need alleged to exist was found to be in respect of unfit or overcrowded houses. Unfit houses are being dealt with under the slum-clearance programme, based on a detailed survey, and overcrowded houses will be dealt with under the Bill at present before Parliament, again after a detailed survey. It would seem that the estimate of 100,000 (and even larger figures which are at times quoted) must be based on some higher standard of accommodation left without definition or must depend upon the conception of a coming substantial increase in the number of men employed on the land.64. It is contended by Mr. Lloyd George that the efforts of the industry have made only a minor contribution to the provision of dwellings for the lower-paid workers. On this it is pertinent to observe, first, that of the approximate total of 800,000 new houses provided in England and Wales by the industry from March 1931 to March 1935 nearly 90 per cent, are under  26 per annum rateable value ( 35 in London). The tendency of unsubsidised small house building since it was resumed, mainly as a result of the Act of 1923, has been to spread steadily down from the relatively more expensive house to the relatively less expensive house. This process has now reached a point at which it makes a most substantial contribution to the provision of houses within the means of large classes of wage earners, especially the &quot;black-coated&quot; wage earners, who require, but do not always receive, consideration. Second, the building industry for the last three years has been producing houses, of which practically the whole are houses of relatively small size, at an average rate of approximately 200,000 a year. These houses find occupiers; otherwise the process would not continue, to say nothing of expanding as it has done in the last two years. The result of the process continued over a period of years must be very largely to increase the total housing accommodation . available in the country and to make the most powerful contribution to the general relief of[11860]
overcrowding, which is admitted to be one of the main objects to be secured by housing policy. Thirdly, those who occupy the new houses provided by the building industry set free other accommo-dation and the transfers thus made do, in fact, result in large measure in the provision of better accommodation within the means of those who for one reason or another do not see their way to go into the new houses. If, accordingly, Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s own figure of two million extra houses as representing the needs within the next few years is to be accepted (and it is not known on what statistical basis the figure rests), it is a fallacy to assume that the unparallelled activity of the building industry is not making an extremely sub-stantial contribution towards the fulfilment of that need, without expense either to the taxpayer or the ratepayer.65. On the planning aspect of the question, Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s conception appears to be that of a single national plan proposed by some central body, and imposed, whether by compulsion or persuasion, upon the whole country. The difference in approach from that of the existing system, which is based on the view that planning emanates from local responsible bodies, acting individually or . in combination, in the light of their knowledge of the district, is fundamental. Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s plan is not capable of being evolved from the existing system and machinery. It necessarily involves an entirely different conception of the relationship of the central and local&apos; governments. Before such a plan can be evolved, it would seem necessary that those responsible for it should base it on a survey of the country, district by district, area by area, region by region, on the principles laid down for Town Planning Authorities under the Town Planning Acts. When this is done, and the national plan is in readiness, industry must in one way or another conform to it, or the plan will fail, for it &apos;&apos;is the essence of such a plan that it will be feasible for the body responsible for its preparation and administration to plan, for example, the ordered transfer of existing industries from any part of the country to any other part, or the establishment of new industries in any area judged suitable for them.66. This question of the relationship of the plan to industry is, indeed, the crux of the whole situation. To make industry conform to the plan there are the methods of propaganda and persuasion, financial subsidy and compulsion.67. The experience of garden cities has shown the difficulties of attempts to persuade industry to settle in districts where it is not inclined in the course of business to find a home. To suggest, indeed, that industries can be persuaded to uproot themselves from districts in which they have established them-selves for good commercial reasons, and transfer themselves to districts in which they see no such commercial advantages, does not appear to be a tenable proposition. Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s memo-randum is not clear on the question whether and how far subsidy and compulsion will be applied to secure his desired object. Without subsidy or compulsion, the proposal appears to the Government to be impossible. The application of compulsion or subsidy to industry to secure this object involves a fundamental change in the relations of Government to industry which cannot, in the opinion of the Government, be justified by ,any advantages to be foreseen.68. The general comment to be made on the whole of this chapter of the document is that the proposals contained in it are wholly inconsistent with the existing organisation of local Town Planning -Authorities. To interrupt the process of local and regional planning at this stage would hardly conduce to that rapid and orderly action, on the need for which Mr. Lloyd George so constantly insists. But, though an attempt has been made in the document to proceed on .the -basis that the central and regional planning powers are not inconsistent with the continuance of the activities of these authorities, whether local or regional, the Government find it impossible to understand how a practical system of relations could be established between the two, and are clearly of the opinion that the new
Itorganisation proposed must be regarded as wholly displacing the present arrangements, and not supplementing them.69. The Government can see no reason why all that is practi-cable in this sphere cannot be attained under the existing system. The bulk of the new housing provision has been sited on new estates, in the neighbourhood of towns, planned and developed on sound lines, and many of the advantages claimed on behalf of garden cities have been in fact secured.70. The national aspects of road planning, railway extension and electricity distribution can be and are being handled by the Ministry of Transport and there would be no advantage in setting up a new Board to perform the same functions. Nor is a national plan required for the zoning of industry, since this can be and is being undertaken in the local plans.71. The close association of housing with town planning is a strong argument for retaining, in the case of town planning, the same relationship of central to local bodies which has been so successful in housing. Locally housing and town planning are, as a rule, in the hands of the same local authority and, centrally, the need for the same association is recognised by their co-ordinated supervision by the Minister of Health, and, in Scotland, by the Department of Health. The fact that town planning cannot with advantage be considered in isolation by each local government district, is recognised by the provision which has been made for the combination of these districts in regional bodies. Progress which was momentarily retarded during the passage of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1982, has been resumed, and, as is normal with the operations of local authorities, its momentum is steadily increasing.[11860]
SECTION V. INDUSTRIAL REORGANISATION.The proposals for industrial reorganisation seem, apart from other difficulties, to raise in an acute form the question of the effect on employment both of the closing of the less economic works and of the introduction of labour-saving devices:72. The proposals of the plan for industrial reorganisation, and those in the succeeding chapter for the development of overseas trade, have been examined by the Government with the greatest attention and care. It is here that Mr. Lloyd George touches upon those aspects of our economy most directly and most seriously affected by the conditions of the outside world. It is, above all, in this sphere that the root remedies for a large part of the present unemployment must be sought, and, above all, in this sphere that the foundations of future prosperity must be well and truly laid.73. The Government have been disappointed to find that upon this very difficult subject the Plans make no contribution which they can usefully adopt.74. Oil the subject of industrial reorganisation the general view of Mr. Lloyd George may perhaps be illustrated by the following quotations  -&quot; The proposals grow out naturally from constitutional precedent and modern developments of our economic system. This system needs amendment and improvement to adapt it to the needs of this generation. The. evils now resulting from it show that. It can be amended without being scrapped. The immense advantages of individual enterprise, energy and initiative-tive which our present economic system fosters are not to be lightly sacrificed. They must rather be controlled and cultivated so that they may yield an ordered harvest for the nation.&quot;&quot; . . . . If the existing machinery of private enterprise is unable to achieve this, then that machinery must be improved and if need be supplemented.&quot;75. If the various references to industrial reorganisation are taken together, three general ideas seem to run through the various suggestions. It is laid down that the State should plan industry; it is vaguely implied that in certain cases the State should share in responsibility for control; and it is suggested (perhaps not very con-sistently) that the State should persuade industry to adopt particular courses by the grant of liberal financial assistance.76. One of the functions of the National Development Board which figures so largely in the document is to prepare schemes for industrial organisation. The State must &quot;think out what industrial developments are desirable and under cover of its guarantee to direct the capital resources of the nation to such productive uses.&quot; On the one hand private enterprise is to remain in being; on the other hand an instrument of the State is to take the initiative in planning. In this way dilemmas arise which have often been discussed, but to which no single satisfactory answer can readily be given. If the State takes the initiative and, above all, if in taking the initiative it holds out the attractions of public subsidies or wields the weapon of compulsion, voluntary reorganisation will cease, for the private entrepreneur will naturally sit back and await the State decision likely to be thrust upon him.77. In any plan that the State evolves a question arises of the responsibility for mistakes of judgment and of losses thereby involved. Where the State compels the formation of large units, the State must safeguard the consumer against monopolistic prices and see that nothing is done to discourage new entrants to the industry or to destroy free enterprise. The State must also see both that the right management is available and that it is actually placed in command, for upon skilful management success will ultimately depend, and the management of large planned organisations highly tests even the -ablest  men.    Bailing this,   the   State  must become  ultimately
responsible to the owners of individual undertakings for any losses it has inflicted on them by its intervention.78. Apart from this, it is not easy to see how an outside State instrument&apos; can acquire the intimate specialised knowledge and experience of particular industries needed to dictate with confidence and with authority the manner in which profitable employment is &quot;best increased. For these reasons, it has seemed to the Government that organisation must come primarily from within.79.. This is not to say that the State has no part in this matter. On the contrary, the Government has shown how much can be achieved, not by compulsion, nor yet by bribing businesses into plans in which they had little or no part, but rather by stimulating or assisting spontaneous development through varying methods fitted to the actual circumstances of each case.80. The iron and steel industry presents a striking example. Importations of foreign iron and steel have been kept in check by Customs duties: output has risen by 70 per cent, as compared with three years ago : exports have increased and consumption at home reached a record figure in 1934. From the outset of the Tariff regime both the Government and the Import Duties Advisory Committee have required the industry to concern themselves actively with reorganisation and to use their new bargaining power in order to arrive at satisfactory arrangements with the European Steel Cartel. Notable examples of reconstruction are the reorganisation of the Colville interests in Scotland, the new enterprise at Corby, the reconstruction of the steel works at Cardiff, Scunthorpe and Workington and the amalgamation of the stainless steel undertakings. The position of the industry showed signs of becoming more difficult at the end of 1934 by reason of increased imports of foreign material. The duties were then increased and in this way a weapon was forged with which the industry could bargain effectively with the European Cartel for an international agreement satisfactory to this country. The effectiveness of this weapon was shown at once by the conclusion on 30th April last of an interim agreement for a period of three months, providing that imports of cartel products into the United Kingdom were not to exceed a rate of 643,000 tons per annum (the 1933 level) for the three months. The immediate object of the increased duties having thus been attained, the higher duties were suspended for the period of the temporary agreement. In the meantime, negotiations for a long term agreement were actively pursued, and on 4th June the heads of a long term agreement were settled for the co-operation of the British industry with the Cartel at the expiry of the temporary agreement on 7th August. Briefly, the major agreement provides that imports into the United Kingdom from cartel countries shall not exceed 670,000 tons (which includes several products not covered by the 643,000 tons provided for in the interim agreement), for the first year, and 525,000 tons in each subsequent year of the agreement. The agreement also secures for the British industry that proportion of the total export trade in neutral markets which it enjoyed in 1934.81. In shipping the grant of a subsidy for a limited time to tramp shipowners was made conditional on a real measure of organi-sation within the industry in the United Kingdom and on a determined effort to arrive at an agreement with foreign shipowners for the elimination of redundant tonnage, that is, an effort to secure international organisation. These conditions&apos; are being complied with.82. The importance of improving the materiel of an industry and of scrapping obsolete equipment is recognised by the Government scheme for the grant of loans on favourable terms to owners of cargo vessels for the reconstruction or modernisation of their fleets on condition of scrapping a prescribed proportion of old tonnage.83. Government financial. assistance for the completion of the-Queen Mary was conditional on the reduction of competition in the North Atlantic passenger trade by the merger of the Gunard and White Star services.
84. In the cotton-spinning industry the Government promised legislation to carry out a scheme for the elimination of surplus spinning capacity, drawn up and approved by the industry. This measure has now been introduced. It provides a contingent Government guarantee which will enable the capital sum required to be raised cheaply. The Government have also passed legislation enabling statutory sanction to be given to wage agreements in the weaving section of the cotton industry, and an order has recently been made under this Act, which will safeguard the industry from, the difficulties caused by the under-cutting of wages.85. An example of an important reconstruction in another industry which present conditions have rendered possible without direct Government intervention is the fusion of the Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Company and the Welsh Associated Collieries.86. As has been indicated, planning is at times mentioned in the document as coupled with control and at other times as coupled with financial assistance. Broadly, Mr. Lloyd George is understood as desiring to retain private enterprise and not to replace it by public control. But the National Development Board is to secure the setting up of an Iron and Steel Board, which will &apos;&apos; take control of the industry and plan its policy,&apos;&apos; and it is to arrange for &apos;&apos; the establishment of a suitable controlling authority for the cotton industry.&quot; If these vague words are intended to enshrine any policy other than that now followed, they seem to imply the abandonment of private enterprise in these industries, though there is no admission of the fact that, if the State is to take over control, it must at the same time take over the ownership of the capital invested.87. Alternatively, the grant of financial assistance is contem-plated in the form of Exchequer guarantees. A policy of Exchequer guarantees is only capable of application in a limited field. Under the Trade Facilities Acts the State guaranteed the interest upon, and the ultimate repayment of, capital borrowed by businesses where it was thought that the use of the money by a business would produce additional employment. The practice was dropped some eight years ago because it failed to attain its object. Industrialists found that by buttressing uneconomic competition it tended to subsidise the inefficient at the expense of the efficient. It therefore injured business rather than aided it, and the State has since suffered heavy losses under these guarantees without compensating advantages.- 88. The value of a guarantee to a credit-worthy business capable of borrowing cheaply on its own account can easily he exaggerated; it is less important than the general reduction of interest rates which the Government has already secured. Where margins are narrow, a guarantee will in suitable conditions enable valuable works which would otherwise be deferred to be put in hand at once, and a striking instance of such a case is to be found in the proposals recently laid before Parliament in&apos; connection with electrification and railway development in London. But such projects are rare and cannot safely be taken to indicate that a great extension of guarantees is practicable or desirable. In particular, the direction of new enter-prise into areas which it now avoids is a difficult problem worthy of all study, but it is not to be solved in the Governments view by such measures as these.89. The difficulty in this part of the subject seems to be that of finding a half-way house between private enterprise and national control without suffering the disadvantages of both systems and securing the advantages of neither. A mistaken policy would also be incompatible with continued industrial confidence, the lack of which was the cause of our late decline and the restoration of which has beeh the foundation of our recovery.90. Even if Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s industrial proposals had been intrinsically of greater value, they would still not have led to increased employment; on the contrary, they would have meant in the first place increased unemployment. Schemes of rationalisation-tion always tend at first to put more men out of work. Some of his proposals in regard to coal-mining may be taken by way of illustra-
tion. He proposes that regional Statutory Boards should devise methods of facilitating the concentration of output in each district. This clearly implies the concentration of production upon the most economic pits, and involves a very large displacement of labour. The pooling of coal-wagons intrinsically desirable and largely accomplished already so far as it is practicable- would reduce employment at the wagon-building works. It is thus natural that when Mr. Lloyd George comes to calculate the effect of his several proposals in curing unemployment, the part to be played by his reorganisation of industry is omitted.91. In short, Mr. Lloyd George proposes to plan, to control or to finance industry. He does not say how this is to be done, or to what ends. The Government have in various industries taken practical measures suited to particular cases. If Mr. Lloyd George had suggested new practical measures, the Government would have been glad to consider them.   He has not.
-B-   &quot; SECTION VI. OVERSEAS TRADE.The Plans advocate a bold initiative in improving our overseas trade relations and trading opportunities, but they recognise the difficulties presented by overseas conditions; their suggestions do not seem to. add materially to what has already been achieved or is being done now. - , .92. The immense importance to our economy of a large and balanced international trade has been discussed in an earlier passage of this note. By the.use of tariffs, by the negotiation of trade agree-ments and in other ways the Government have striven to right the balance of trade and open new avenues for our exports.93. The Import Duties Act was passed in February 1932. It imposed (with some exceptions) a flat rate duty of 10 per cent, on foreign imports. By this Act also the Import Duties Advisory Committee were charged to advise on the construction of a tariff (over and above the flat rate) to aid home industry, though with due regard to the interests of using as well as of producing industries. Within two months of their appointment the Committee recom-mended, and Parliament confirmed, a general scheme of additional duties on manufactured goods.94. The Committee then directed their efforts to meet the circumstances of individual industries. They have now spent three years on this work, which has contributed substantially to the improvement in the figures of employment and to the increase in industrial production. These results have been accompanied by contributions to the Exchequer from the duties of over  20 m. a year.95. At the Ottawa Conference in the summer of 1932 the key-note of policy was the stimulation of Empire trade by the greatest possible reduction of Empire trade barriers. The main contribution of this country was the accord of entry, free of all duty, to the whole range of goods from the Dominions (and S. Rhodesia) with whom agreements were concluded and from India, which otherwise would have become dutiable under the new tariff. To assist those parts of the Empire in special directions, special duties on a range of foreign goods were also imposed.96. The Dominions and India, for their part, accorded to many of our goods reductions of duties and increased preferences over foreign goods. India, of her own accord, instituted at Ottawa the policy of Empire preference as such, and freely granted preferences to a wide range of United Kingdom goods.97. The Ottawa Agreements have now been in force for some three years, and the results begin to show themselves in the trade statistics. As regards imports into the United Kingdom, the Dominions began to experience the advantages of our new policy in the spring of 1932. As between 1931 and 1934 imports from the &quot; Ottawa &quot; Dominions (including India) have increased by nearly  30 millions. The advantages accorded to our exports by the Dominions did not come into force until towards the end of 1932. As between that year and 1934 our exports to the &quot;Ottawa&quot; Dominions (including India) have increased by about  26 millions.98. Following the Ottawa Agreements, the Government embarked on the policy of developing export trade by negotiating trade agreements with foreign countries. This policy was rendered possible by the tariff, the creation of which brought home to foreign countries the importance to them of our market and the necessity of coming to terms with us. In the result commercial agreements have been concluded in the last three years with seventeen foreign countries, many of which are amongst our most important customers. Negotiations are now proceeding, or in contemplation, with a number of other countries.99. Among the benefits secured are reductions of foreign tariffs on goods of special interest to this country, undertakings for the purchase of United Kingdom produce and manufactures, fair  quotas  for  United  Kingdom  exports,   the  payment  of  old
debts due. to pur traders,.,and the provision of exchange to pay for current trade, as well as trie better treatment of British shipping. The general trend of the cpal export trade resulting from, quotas and other artificial restrictions imposed overseas is shown by the fact that exports of coal to countries with which agreements have not been made decreased by approximately If million tons in 1984 as compared with 1932. During the same period the exports of coal to those countries with which agreements were made increased by approximately 2  million tons, resulting in the additional working of over 2 million man shifts.     - -100. As regards trade generally, the advantages of the agree-tnents concluded in 1933 can be roughly measured by comparing our exports to the countries concerned in 1932 and 1934. As between 1932 and 1934 exports to foreign countries as a whole increased from  199^ million to  210-1 million, or by about 5 per cent., and exports to British countries from  1651- million to  185^- million, or by about 12 per cent. In the same period exports to the group of countries covered by the agreements concerned increased by no less than 33 per cent., the most favourable case being Finland, where the improvement reached 60 per cent.101. While the volume of world trade in 1934 barely exceeded that in 1933, exports of United Kingdom goods increased in volume by over 7 per cent. There has, in fact, been a steady increase in United Kingdom exports for more than two years&quot;, while the total value of all world trade has remained substantially unchanged. In the first quarter of this year our exports were 18 per cent, greater than two years earlier.102. In the meanwhile the Government has been engaged also upon the economic problems of the Colonial Empire. A complete Economic Survey has for the first time been drawn up. Works of development have continued to be fostered from the Colonial Development Fund. Increased activities have been undertaken in the field of research. But the chief problem of these times is that of finding markets for Colonial produce. By the Import Duties Act the Colonies were given a wide range of preferences which have since been, extended. As a result of the Ottawa agreements, Colonial preference is now substantially Empire-wide, and is even extended by other Empire countries to Colonies and mandated territories which are precluded from reciprocating. In all foreign trade treaties the Government endeavour to obtain for Colonial products a secure foothold in the foreign markets concerned.103. Upon the other side our exports to the Colonies now repre-seht more than 10 per cent, of our total trade as against 6 per cent, in 1924. The recent introduction of the quota on foreign textiles a proposal widely and readily accepted in the Colonial territories concerned-has resulted in a 150 per cent, rise in our cotton textile exports to these lands.104. In passing to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposals, the Govern-ment are obliged to record with some disappointment that his suggestions add little to what, amid the greatest external difficulties, has by their policy been achieved. Nothing in his document suggests that he sees any opportunity for useful measures on the part of the Government on lines other than those they now pursue, save in particular regions, viz., the Colonies, India, China and Russia. It is a fact, that while tariff negotiations have been conducted with many countries where they gave a prospect of success, in the case, that is, of countries which have a favourable balance of trade and whose economic basis is in the main complementary to ours, they cannot be equally effective in the case of countries which are our commercial competitors, in. the. markets of the world.105. As regards the Colonies, Mr. Lloyd George advocates an increase in the production of raw materials which we should purchase and.pay for by export to the Colonies of our manufactured goods. He refers also to the creation of new markets in other parts of the world. The exploitation of mutual trade with the Colonies and the creation of new markets for them are matters to which the Govern-;&apos;    [11860]. b
merit themselves attach the-greatest importance. They are disposed to agree&apos; that further development in this direction, is stillpossible, and the means of effecting this are under examination; -but it must be emphasised that in present conditions the problem of finding new markets for colonial products is more pressing than that of increasing the amount of production.106. The Indian market, Mr. Lloyd George says, is suffering bitterly from the fall of world prices; and from the effects of British monetary policy. The collocation of these two causes is, at least, surprising. As has often been stated, one of the objects of the British monetary policy has been to arrest the fall of prices and to take all practicable steps to reverse it.107. While in many foreign countries prices have been falling to the continuous injury of employment and of trade and in others great currency vicissitudes have been suffered, the pound sterling since its divorce from gold has been maintained as the steadiest currency in the world. If its value has varied as against the value of gold, that is due to vagaries in the value of gold, not of the pound. The pur-chasing power of sterling in the hands of the consumer has been unimpaired : the cost of living has, indeed, slightly fallen. Mean-time, a small but definite rise in the general index of wholesale sterling prices conceals a much more substantial rise in the prices of primary products, the special index of which has risen from 100 to 140, and it is the prices of primary products in this country, their principal market, which are of special importance to India and the Empire. The countries of the Empire and many foreign countries which have allied themselves to sterling have also, in trade within the group, enjoyed immunity from the currency fluctuations which have afflicted the other countries of the world.108. Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s assertion that the adoption by us of an expansionist policy of public development here would induce an upward movement of wholesale prices is one which the Government do not accept for reasons which have already been indicated. The adoption, on the other hand, of a policy of cheap money and the institution of lower rates of interest have been powerful agencies in producing the rise of wholesale prices which has, in fact, been secured.109. Mr. Lloyd George writes tentatively and vaguely also of special measures in relation to Indian currency. He says that this matter should be promptly and carefully examined by currency experts. It has been so examined and the Government are aware of no measures, other than those now pursued, which could usefully be adopted.110. The document also mentions the question of transport; but in the existing condition of Indian trade there is no real demand for increased capital outlay oil new lines or rolling stock beyond what is being undertaken at the present time. Indeed, much of the rolling stock is at present not being used to the full capacity owing to insufficiency of traffic. Having regard to the favourable conditions governing Indian credit in London and in India at the present time, the Government of India would have no difficulty in expanding the railway programme if conditions justified it.111. The Government are entirely at one with Mr. Lloyd George in desiring to secure by all means in their power the welfare and prosperity of this great sub-continent: they find nothing in his pro-posals which will assist to this end.112. Mr. Lloyd George proposes that in common with the United States and Russia, we should join with Japan in aiding China to &quot; get on her own feet.&quot; We should effect this object, in his view, primarily by means of financial assistance for the development of her internal transport. China has suffered grievously in recent years both from internal dissension, from the ravages of the world crisis, and from currency misfortunes. Our interest in China is great, and the question of possible action to assist that country is continuously engaging the attention of the Government in common with the other interested Bowers.   Only recently arrangements have
27 i;been made for a Financial Mission to proceed to China to explore the problems to- which the situation gives rise and to advise the Government as to the best means for their solution. Some,expansion can be.hoped for, but the situation is such :that the memorandum, in speaking of unlimited room for the expansion of our trade with China, can only be said to ignore the hard facts of the case as it actually stands to-day.113. About Russia Mr. LloydGeorge says little. His suggestion that there is here also unlimited room for the expansion of our export trade seems to ignore the well-known intention of the Soviet Government to make Russia as far as possible self-sufficient, an intention of which there is already considerable evidence. In fact, the Government, by the Commercial Agreement, have taken steps to improve our balance of trade with Russia, and the Export Credits machinery is available to assist in financing orders.. 114. That every effort should be made to expand our export trade and to improve the external conditions against which our export industries are fighting is an axiom which none will deny. This is a problem which has so far baffled virtually every country in the world. The Government will continue their efforts to solve it, but it does not seem to them that there is in Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s suggestions any new objective which they can pursue with prospects of national advantage, while his agricultural proposals cannot fail to have an adverse effect in this sphere.
SECTION VII. SCHOOL AGE, &apos; RETIRING PENSIONS&apos; AND SHORTER HOURS.The Plans propose the raising of the school-leaving age and other social changes. The several proposals present various difficulties without going to the root of the employment problem.115. The Government have in-very&apos;practical ways shown them-selyes mindful of the welfare of children and young people-by the Children and Young Persons Act, 1932, by the Shops. Act,. 1934, and by the extension of unemployment insurance to juveniles and the large increase in the provision of Junior Instruction Centres under the Unemployment Insurance Act.116. The proposal to raise the school-leaving age to 15 is one with which the Government are in strong sympathy. The late Prime Minister made it known some time ago that the question was engaging the Government&apos;s consideration. There are, however, practical difficulties to be overcome and varying interests to be reconciled. A reasonable period of time is needed to frame satis-factory and acceptable proposals.&apos; 117. Even if the well-known difficulties can be overcome, the Government think that the new scheme could not be brought into&apos; operation earlier than in the year 1939 or 1940. By that time, however, conditions will have materially altered and the extent of juvenile unemployment should be substantially reduced. The number of children leaving school at present is very high on account of the increase in the birth rate in the years immediately following the War. But this is transitory : the numbers leaving school have already begun to drop, and by about 1940 a shortage rather than a surplus of juvenile labour is likely to exist except in the most depressed areas.118. It is probable that, in a large proportion of cases, the with-drawal from the labour market of juveniles in the youngest age group would not result in their replacement by adults or older juveniles. Many juveniles are employed on work that is a convenience rather than a necessity to the employer. Moreover, in many occupations the nature of the employment on which young persons are engaged makes it difficult, if not impossible, to substitute adults or, in some cases, older juveniles, and the tendency would be towards increased mechanisation or a re-organisation of duties.119. For reasons such -as these it is difficult to estimate with any precision the number of additional vacancies that would be provided by raising the school age. Some vacancies there would no doubt be, but in the view of the Government they are not likely to be sufficiently numerous to make the increase of employment a consideration of real importance in deciding whether the school age should be raised.120. Account must also be taken of the question whether exemptions from continuance at school are to be allowed for juveniles who have useful work awaiting them, and also of the question whether maintenance allowances are to be granted to those who continue at school. There has been some experience of the results of granting exemptions in areas where the school-leaving age has already been raised under special bye-laws, and the evidence tends to show that if a system of exemptions were generally introduced, the effect on employment of a higher age for leaving school would be negligible. The grant of maintenance allowances would, of course, necessarily add substantially to the burden upon the taxpayer and ratepayer which, this proposal in any event entails.121. Mr. Lloyd George writes also, though in extremely guarded terms, of a reduction in the hours of labour. &quot;Our policy should aim at the encouragement of a reduction in the weekly hours of labour, with a five-day week, in those industries which can adopt this plan immediately without any increase in the real cost of production. Co-ordinated plans of development of our national resources should result in raising the general standard of living. This implies that the advantage of increased production would be
shared by the whole community. It might thus prove possible to reduce the hours of labour over a wide field, without any real increase in the cost of production.&quot;122. Mr. Lloyd George mentions in this connection that as a result of. the application of science to industry, a revolutionary increase of production per head has occurred and has caused a rapid displacement of labour. While there is much truth in the statement it cannot be accepted entirely without qualification. While new-inventions may result initially in the displacement of labour in the industry concerned, it does not follow that the total volume of employment is decreased. The number of insured persons in employment is greater to-day than ever before, and among the industries showing the greatest expansion in employment are some, such as electrical engineering, in which large use has been made of improved machinery. If scientific invention in one direction enables old processes to be carried out with less expenditure of man-power, in other directions it enables entirely new products, to be manu-factured, new avenues of employment to be opened out and a higher standard of comfort to be enjoyed throughout the community.123. The question thus has two sides. It also throws up many practical difficulties. The Government understand Mr. Lloyd George to hold that any reduction of hours of work should entail no reduction of wages, but, in the absence of international agreement on this subject, which is far from being attained, many industries would be quite unable to contemplate the loss involved in the change. It was made clear at the recent International Labour Conference that the majority of Governments in favour of an international convention on the subject of the reduction of hours are not prepared to support the maintenance of wages as a condition of such reduction. In this they were supported by their workers&apos; representatives who were not in complete agreement with their British colleagues on this aspect of the matter.124. In general, the Government are in sympathy with Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s view, carefully guarded as it is, so far as effect can be given to it without damage to industry and without reduction of wages. Efforts made by the last Government were directed to this end, and discussions are now taking place between the Minister of Labour and particular industrial organisations on this and other cognate subjects. But it would be a mistake to count upon any substantial influence upon employment from reduction of hours at the present time. Mr. Lloyd George is understood to accept this view; the passage in his document which calculates the effect of his various proposals upon employment makes no further reference to this subject.125. Finally, it is stated that, if a surplus of unabsorbed labour is left, consideration will have to be given to &quot;the provision of adequate pensions at the age of 60 on condition that those receiving them retire from paid employment.&quot; The note nowhere elaborates this suggestion, nor does it make any proposal as to the amount of the pension. In the discussions Mr. Lloyd George was understood to suggest that the offer of a pension of 10s. with a cottage and an allotment might tempt many workers to give up their work, although a more substantial compensation would be necessary if retirement at sixty were made compulsory.126. The provision of a cottage and an allotment in an area in which the retiring worker wished to spend the rest of his life might be practicable and economical in particular areas or in individual cases, but as a general means of securing voluntary retirement of great numbers of city workers it seems to the Government to present many difficulties and to be likely to involve great cost; its attraction would hardly be much increased by making the 10s. pension begin at 60 instead of 65 or 70.127. Various schemes for the grant of retiring pensions have from time to time been canvassed. In general, they prove on examination to involve a quite disproportionate burden on the tax-[11860] f
payer. There is little reason to suppose that workers who are in good permanent employment would voluntarily give lip their job and enter into an undertaking never to work again Unless it was made very fully worth their while, and the Government would hesitate greatly to apply compulsion and make such workers take this course irrespective of their wishes, even upon very generous terms.128. A detailed discussion of the difficulties involved in schemes of this character is beyond the scope of this statement, but in the Government&apos;s view, based on the most careful calculations that can be made, any reasonably fair scheme capable of removing from the field of employment the main proportion of workers who are over sixty years of age would involve additional annual taxation of at least  100 million per annum. This addition to the taxpayers burdens, intolerable in itself, would not, in fact, reduce unemploy-ment at all; it would only replace one set of workers in industry by another younger set. Indeed, it would decrease employment, for by no means all workers over sixty who retired on to pensions would provide vacancies for younger workers; in particular, good employers often retain old hands when strict business motives would call for their dismissal.
SECTION VIII. PUBLIC WORKS SCHEMES.The public works programme is unfruitful of good new suggestions for developing our national resources and improving national conditions.129. The Plans are understood to advocate the early expenditure of upwards of  100 million on the completion of the trunk road system, including the remodelling of existing main roads with twin carriage-ways, footpaths and cycle tracks, the strengthening of bridges, the improvement of minor roads, and so on. A number of the projects mentioned in vague terms in connection with town planning fall under the same head. In this again there is nothing novel except scale and pace. Apart from annual outgoings on main-tenance, &amp;c, which though necessary are very heavy, and on minor improvements, some  150 million has been spent on major improve-ments of the roads of this country since the War. No country possesses a finer system than ours. Its extension and improvement, however, is part of the policy of the present Govexnment, and they are, in fact, to-day in negotiation with Local Authorities for the settlement of a five-year plan of extensive new work.130. Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s Plan lays great stress on the question of road safety. As is well known, to no subject have the Government given greater attention; important contributions have been made by arousing the public interest on the subject and by such practical measures as the institution of pedestrian crossings and the driving tests, the imposition of the speed limit in built-up areas, and the installation of traffic light signals. The result has been a considerable decrease in the number of deaths and injuries on the road despite an increase.of a quarter of a million in the number of motor vehicles as compared with the corresponding period last year. It cannot be laid down, however, that the degree of safety on our roads is to be measured by the amount of money spent upon them.181. With regard to the specific projects mentioned by Mr. Lloyd George for the construction of tunnels and bridges, the Government will, for their part, favourably consider such of these as are found on examination to be practicable and desirable and to merit national assistance.132. The Plans recall that schemes for electrification of suburban railways have been estimated as &quot;capable of utilising a total capital expenditure of  80 million to  100 million.&quot; Mention is also made at another point of the need for further tubes near London. The Government have only recently arranged financial facilities for tube construction, suburban railway electrification and other transport purposes in the London area at a capital cost of  35 million. This represents the largest scheme of urban transport development which has ever been envisaged within a similar period. There may be other plans of like character in the provinces justifying similar facilities. They have not as yet, however, been laid before the Government.138. The reference to air transport suggests other reflections. It has been the policy of successive Governments in the United Kingdom, whilst recognising to the full the great benefits which air transport can confer on the community, and the need for assisting it by grants from the Exchequer during the early stages of its develop-ment, never to lose sight of the necessity for continuous progress towards a commercial basis of operation. The very heavy losses sustained by the private investor and the lavish outpouring of public money on subsidies which have been seen in some other countries have been avoided here. These facts seem to be hardly appreciated in the Plans. But the Government need no reminder of the urgency of fostering air transport by all legitimate means. A new scheme for the far-reaching development of Imperial air transport was announced to Parliament at the end of last year and has since been under con-tinuous and active discussion with the Dominions, India and the Colonies. This scheme provides for the drastic curtailment of [11860] F 2
existing time schedules, which in many, cases will be more than halved; for a great increase, in the frequency of services; for the opening up of new routes; and, last.but by no means least, for the future transport of all first-class mail matter by air at the existing Imperial postage rate, but with a reduced unit of weight a postal development on a scale to which there is as yet no parallel in any other part of the world. Special enquiries have been instituted con-currently into the improvement of the ground organisation of our Empire routes to fit them for night flying, and into the possibility of largely increasing the number of aerodromes and ancillary facilities in the United Kingdom, whilst, in addition, a strong Inter-depart-mental Committee has been set up to keep the whole question of the further development of air transport under constant review.134. The Plans suggest that the extension of Canal under-takings would relieve the railways of the burden of bulky non-perishable traffic. There is, however, little reason to suppose that the diversion of this traffic would be welcomed by the railways. Developments can, indeed, be suggested which deserve consideration by the interests concerned, but one at least of the two large proposals suggested seems to the Government to be altogether ill-conceived.135. On Docks and Harbours the capital expenditure in recent years under State-assisted schemes amounts to some  30 million. Other projects which might merit State assistance are of minor scope.136. On the development of telephones, the document suggests no object which is not now being actively pursued by the Govern-ment, and in fact a three years&apos; plan involving an expenditure of some  30 million had already been put in hand before Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposals were made.137. The observations in the document on rural water supplies appear to take no account of the fact that the problem of defective rural water supply was attacked by the Government early in 1934. For England and Wales a million pounds of Exchequer money were made available for the service, over and above contributions from the rate fund. Grants have been provisionally allocated in respect of schemes for nearly 1,300 parishes, of an estimated total cost of  3 million; work is on hand also in nearly 500 additional parishes where Exchequer grant is not required. The work of providing water in the country districts where it is needed is proceeding evenly and steadily, and, in the view of the Government, their Act of 1934 will undoubtedly solve the problem so far as it is soluble. Some cases there will, of course, always be of widely separated houses, or small groups of houses, where a piped supply will never be economically justified. For Scotland a sum of  137,500 was similarly made available, and grants have been allocated in respect of 70 schemes, the capital cost of which is estimated at  577,000. Work is proceeding or is about to begin on 26 other schemes without Exchequer assistance.138. Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposals for the reclamation and reconditioning of agricultural land seem to the Government to be largely conditional upon the adoption of his plans for land settle-ment, which it has already been explained the Government could not see their way to adopt. It would therefore scarcely be fair to criticise the reconditioning proposals regarded by themselves without recognising this fact. The more essential points have, indeed, been mentioned in an earlier passage of this statement dealing with the agricultural question. The reclamation of land from the sea and the reconditioning of heath and marsh land are intrinsically attractive suggestions. But in view of the high cost, the additional burden on the taxpayer and the uncertain economic prospects of the land thus brought into use, heavy expenditure for these purposes would not be justified. The Government prefer to devote Exchequer resources in the form of grants for arterial drainage operations to ensure that land now under cultivation, especially in those parts of the country where land drainage is an essential operation, shall remain productive.139. The nature of these public works suggests a further reflection on the effect of the Plans on unemployment.   The public
works were expected to provide direct employment, on the site of the works, for some 550,000 workers suffering from periods of long-term unemployment. The evil of long-term periods of unemployment, grave and distressing as it is, is mainly confined to particular areas in which export industries have been stricken down by the world crisis.   Accordingly, Mr. Lloyd George writes : -&quot;Preference will doubtless be given to those schemes which can be put in hand near the districts where there are large numbers of workless, to schemes which involve a high proportion of labour, and tp schemes which draw their materials from industries that are in special need of stimulation.&quot;140. Unfortunately, this suggestion flies in the face of the facts. It is above all in those districts of the South and the Midlands where a growing population has gathered and long-term unemployment is least prevalent that public works on a sufficient scale can be usefully conceived. Nor do public works of any ordinary kind automatically supply orders to such trades as the mining, textile or shipbuilding industries, which are specially depressed. For these reasons the Government have to seek different measures for dealing with this problem.
SECTION IX.  MACHINERY : NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BOARD AND THE  SUPER CABINET.The Plans, by their proposal to create a National Development Board, would introduce ivith the present system of Government a new-body which would either be unable to enforce its own recommenda-tions or would make serious inroads into constitutional control and private liberty.141. Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposal to set up a National Development Board to make a national survey, to prepare plans for land development, the organisation of industry, and the improve-ment of national services, and to give advice as to the financing of its schemes presents a picture which at first sight looks attractive. But it raises a number of questions to which it is difficult to find an answer.142. To begin with the composition of the proposed Board, it would seem that the functions to be entrusted to it cover so wide a field and trench on so many departments of Government as to require almost superhuman qualities of wisdom, foresight, judgment, experience and technical acquirements in its members. The present Government, like its predecessors, is deeply indebted to many men and women distinguished in all walks of life who, assembled in Royal Commissions or Committees, have been asked to examine and advise upon important topics of the day. Many State documents of first-class importance testify to the ability with which experienced outside judgments have illumined great State questions. But the members of every Government have had to recognise how difficult it is to find persons who, having the qualities required for these tasks, can also afford the leisure necessary to undertake the temporary burden of an investigation, even though limited both in scope and time. In the opinion of the Government, the task of discovering persons competent to under-take the functions assigned to the Board from among the classes named, persons who would require to be provided with a working practical experience both of local and national administration if their recommendations were to have any value, would indeed be a formidable one. But assuming that the difficulty of finding the right personnel can be surmounted, the next question that arises is what powers are to be given to the Board to ensure that its schemes shall be operated. &quot; The Board,&quot; says Mr. Lloyd George, &quot;would be there to get things done.&quot; But it does not appear that it would have any power to get things done. It is &quot; to produce constructive and fruitful ideas,&quot; but these ideas are to be submitted to the Cabinet, and the Cabinet will only &quot; authorise such of the recommendations as it approved.&quot; It is impossible that any recommendation made by the Board should not affect some Depart-ment, and &quot; Departments concerned .... would of course be given an opportunity of reviewing them and presenting their views on them to the Cabinet.&quot; Is it not likely that the Cabinet might often prefer the views of Ministers, based on the accumulated knowledge and experience of their Departments, to those of this rather amateur body of planners? And, if so, are the Board going meekly to accept the rejection of plans on which they may have spent many hours or even weeks of thought?143. In the course of the discussion Mr. Lloyd George was asked whether he contemplated that the Board would have the right to make public schemes which had been submitted to the Cabinet and rejected by them. It. was not an easy question to answer, but if the Board is, as proposed, to avoid any entanglement in party political conflicts,&quot; the answer must clearly be in the negative. It can, however, hardly be supposed that the Board, composed as it must be of, persons of most outstanding authority and distinction, would consent to remain so muzzled. Yet if it were to be given freedom to express its views it would be in a position to appeal to the public over the heads of the Cabinet, and responsibility would cease to reside in those constitution-ally appointed to exercise it.
144. Incidentally, Mr. Lloyd George wishes to reduce the Cabinet bo a body of five Ministers, none of whom (except the Chancellor of the Exchequer) would be in charge of a Department. In this he uses the analogy of the War Cabinet, and he claims that in this way swifter decisions would be possible, while Ministers, freed from the burden of Departments, would have leisure for planning the future. In the great emergency of the war, when the entire energies of the nation were concentrated upon the single object of attaining victory, and when vital decisions had often to be taken in a few hours, a small Cabinet was essential for the effective conduct of the struggle. To-day the position is different. There is no longer the same desperate need for haste : it is more important to avoid mistakes. Moreover, it is very doubtful if the plan of a Development Board, submitting its proposals  to a Cabinet which in turn would necessarily have to submit them to Departments before deciding whether to adopt them, would really lead to more rapid action. . On the other hand it is not to be supposed that planning is impossible under the present system. It is true, of course, that all Ministers have not time to study all issues that arise, but it has long been the practice to remit particular problems or particular aspects of policy to small Committees of the Cabinet and this system has recently been further developed by the appointment of a special General Purposes Committee of the Cabinet, which has the particular function of examining and reporting to the full Cabinet questions involving long-range policy. The Government are satisfied that this elastic and flexible system is better adapted to the conditions of peace time than the more rigid proposals of the plan which would, in their opinion, soon prove to be unworkable in practice.145. Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s scheme, it will have been observed, touches almost every phase of national activity. This is a country of constitutional Government in which the development of great policies regularly proceeds under the criticism and control of Parliament. It is nowhere stated in Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s memorandum that this control is to be withdrawn, yet it is difficult to believe that it could be maintained if the pace contemplated in bringing his plans into operation is to be achieved, and among the various &quot;delaying preliminaries &quot; which he cites the examination by Parliament finds no place.146. In general the Plans propose to alter the industrial and economic structure of the nation, while leaving intact, or at least suggesting no overt change in, the political institutions, the freedom of private action, and the ultimate political control by the elector, which are essential parts of our national life. But experience shows that economics and politics are always and inevitably interlocked. In the economic sphere, Mr. Lloyd George in effect would establish an authoritarian State : initiative would rest with a committee which could only be effective if it was dictatorial, and parliamentary checks would be removed; and if the representatives of the people are power-less, the people cannot be free except by sufferance of the executive. The Government, of course, would have no wish to restrict liberty for restriction^ sake; but if, for example, they are to impose schemes of work from above, to canalise the nation&apos;s savings, to transfer workers from trade to trade and factories from place to place, how can they do otherwise? D.O.R.A. was necessary during the war in order to mobilise the national resources for a single overmastering aim; restrictions on liberty no less severe would be necessary to achieve some of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s ends.147. This surely is the least meditated, just as it is the least argued, aspect of the Plans. A Fascist system and it is nothing less which Mr. Lloyd George proposes is not suited to the genius of this country. There is nothing in to-day&apos;s conditions which requires the suspension of the Constitution and the elimination of those Parlia-mentary checks and controls which long experience has shown to be the only safeguard of the citizen&apos;s liberty.
SECTION X. CONCLUSION.148. &quot;The present feeling throughout industry and com-merce,&quot; writes Mr. Lloyd George, &quot; is one of apprehension. Progress where it occurs is slow and reluctant. The expectation which had begun to show itself a little while back that there would shortly be a trade revival, possibly amounting to a boom, has faded. People of an enterprising habit, who are disposed always to start their preparations well in advance when better trade is in prospect, are to-day holding back. They are afraid of what the future may bring forth in the shape of fresh depression.&quot;149. The Government do not recognise this passage as a true picture of the present state of the country. On the contrary, in spite of the disturbed conditions in other lands, they believe that confidence in the future remains firm and well founded. To main-tain that confidence by the pursuance of a steady policy of sound finance accompanied by the encouragement of industry and commerce through the various measures they have taken to protect and expand our markets is in their view the most essential task of government.150. After an exhaustive examination of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposals, they are compelled to register their opinion that they do not offer any reasonable hope of a solution of the unemployment problem or any substantial advantage to the country, but that on the contrary their adoption would go far to undermine the measure of prosperity already attained.
