THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1935.MOST SECRET. Copy No. 40CP; 125 (35).CABINET.HONG KONG CURRENCY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. v;-;IT has recently become necessary to consider whether any action should be taken with regard to Hong Kong currency, in view of developments in the silver market. Copies of the more important telegrams which have been exchanged with the Governor have already been circulated to the Cabinet; but the measures contemplated are of sufficient importance to justify the circulation of a brief note explaining the situation for the information of the Cabinet. No decision is required at present.2. In June 1934 the passing of the Silver Purchase Act made it mandatory on the United States Government to increase its stock of silver, and the resultant purchases by the United States Government itself and by speculators have caused a succession of sharp rises in the price of silver. These have inevitably had serious repercussions on China and Hong Kong, the currencies of which were based on silver and appreciated as the price of silver rose. The appreciation of the Chinese currency, with the deflationary effects normally accompanying such a movement and the tendency for silver to be drained out of the country, led the Chinese Government in October last year to impose a variable tax on the export of silver. The effect of this tax and of a subsequent understanding between the Banks in Shanghai not to export silver, has been to depreciate the exchange value of Chinese currency by over 30 per cent, below its silver parity.3. The Hong Kong dollar, on the other hand, has continued to reflect the fluctuations of silver, and has appreciated from a value of about Is. 5d. in June 1934 to about 2s. 4z\d. It has been accepted in the past that Hong Kong should remain on the same currency basis as China, and until last year this meant remaining on a silver standard. As from October 1934 China ceased to be on a full silver standard, and it became necessary to consider whether Hong Kong should continue to remain on that basis. The appreciation of the Hong Kong dollar in terms of sterling and other non-Chinese currencies might in any case be expected to cause depression of trade in the Colony, but an appreciation in terms of the currency of Shanghai, Hong Kong&apos;s principal competitor both in commerce and in industry, is obviously an even more serious matter.4. The Governor of Hong Kong was consulted last autumn as to the desirability of action, in view of the change in China; but, as there appeared to be no general feeling in the Colony in favour of any change, it was decided that nothing could then be done. In April this year a further sharp rise in the price of silver took place (owing to a rise in the price offered by the United States Government for silver mined in the United States), and there was a corresponding appreciation of the Hong Kong dollar, while the Shanghai dollar remained comparatively stable. The Governor then reported that anxiety was being expressed in the Colony, and suggestions were being made that an export tax should be imposed so as to bring Hong Kong currency into line with that of China or that a sterling basis should be adopted. The whole question has therefore been carefully reconsidered by the Colonial Office Currency Committee, on which the Treasury and the Bank of England are represented, and the Committee has [11741]
recommended that action should be taken to reduce the value of the Hong Kong dollar to something approaching that of the Shanghai dollar, and then to endeavour to maintain it approximately at parity with Shanghai. The means proposed to effect this is the imposition of a variable export tax similar to that in operation in China. An officer of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury is being sent to advise the Hong Kong Government in the operation of this policy; land it is intended that, unless emergency action has to be taken earlier, the export tax should be imposed as soon as possible after the arrival of this officer, which is expected to take place about the 26th June.5. The decision to send out an adviser is being kept secret, as there is good reason to fear that this would give rise to large speculative withdrawals of silver if it became known.6. It is hoped that the imposition of an export tax will make it possible to avoid fundamental changes in the currency of Hong Kong until the future of Chinese currency becomes clearer, and it becomes possible to consider the future of Hong Kong currency in relation to that of Chinese currency. Steps are, however, being taken, by drafting the necessary instruments, and exploring the possibility of making adequate sterling resources available, to enable the adoption of a sterling basis for Hong Kong currency to be put into effect very rapidly, should such a policy be thought desirable hereafter.(Initialled)      M.
