ns JftOTMHra IS THE PROPERTY-OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S (K)VEKBMENT?.B I B E 1&apos;.COITRIGHT RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED&apos; STATES OP AMERICA. &apos; Note &quot;by the President of the. Board of Trade.1.    On 22nd May last the Cabinet reserved their decision (Cabinet 30 (35)  conclusion 6)  regarding possible action in regard to the disabilities&quot; under which our authors suffer in the matter of American Copyright, which were the subject of my Memorandum of the 17th May (C.P.104(35)).      On the 31st May I received a deputation representing Authors, Publishers and Printers, who came to urge that the Government should do all that was possible to secure the removal of their disabilities.2.    The deputation was of course agreed in wishing to see the position remedied by the adhesion of the United States to the Berne Convention.      The publishers were, however,  apprehen-sive that retaliatory action by this country might provoke counter action by the United States which would make the position worse by depriving publishers of certain benefits which are voluntarily accorded to them at present by reputable United States publishers.      The printers were divided in opinion and only the authors were as a body in favour of retaliatory acti on.3.    Having regard to these views and to the course of public affairs in the United States I requested the Foreign Office to ascertain whether His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington desired to modify his previous recommendation in favour of Government action in this country.    Sir Ronald Lindsay has replied that in all the circumstances he now feels that further action should be deferred.    Accordingly I propose to take] no further steps for the present in the direction of retail a-tion.      The Foreign Secretary agrees with this view. Board of Trade, .
