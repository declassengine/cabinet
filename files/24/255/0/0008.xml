41(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^S GOVERNMENT),CABINET.WATERLOO    BRIDGE-Memorandum &quot;by the minister of Transport cSECRET s 0V?V&quot;93( 35 ) .COPY NO,The action of the London County Council in againincluding in their Money Bill &amp;f the present Session provision for borrowing for the purpose of their scheme for demolishing the existing Waterloo Bridge and building a new bridge makes it necessary to bring this matter once more to the attention of the Cabinet,,informed the Council that they would be prepared to make a grant of 60 per cent towards the cost of an agreed scheme for rebuilding the bridge to take six lines of traffic      &quot;When the Council&apos;s roney Bill came before the House of Commons in Lay, 1932, an Instruction Y/as moved and carried deleting tho provision empowering the Council to borrow their share of the cost.      With the approval of the Cabinets  the then Minister of Transport informed the Council that he would be unable to sanction a grant from the Road Fund to any scheme dealing with Waterloo Bridge which ran contrary to the expressed opinion of Parliament,,      In their Money Bill of last year, the new Councilagain inserted the provision for borrowing for their scheme of demolishing the existing bridge and building a new bridge* On the 30th lay,  1934, Sir William Davison moved an instruction to the Committee to which the Bill was to be referred to strike out this provision.      in the course of debate my predecessor made the following statement on behalf of the Government.-House took on the 1st June, 1932, did not, technically, deal with the Road Fund grant.      it operated only as a ban upon it will be remembered that the Government originally&quot;It is   of course,  true that the decision which the
borrowing by the London County Council, but my predecessor atithe time accepted that resolution as an indication of the feelings and desires of this House and felt himself precluded by it from giving any grant for a scheme which involved the destruction of Waterloo Bridge, even if the London County Council would he ahle by other financial methods to raise their share.      I, of course, feel myself under the same obligation to this House and I so informed Mr. Morrison when, soon after the county council election, he raised the matter anew.      If to-night the House alters the decision which it took two years ago, I shall regard that ban as removed.      I shall regard myself then as being in a position to offer a grant for a new Waterloo Bridge&quot;.The Instruction was carried by 194 votes to 159, and the question of a grant lapsed for a second time.On the 12th June, 1934, the Council considered a joint report from their Highway and Finance Committees, and decided to proceed with their scheme and to charge the cost to Rate Account.     The report pointed out that it did not appear likely that the Council &quot;would at the present time receive any assistance from the Road Fund towards the cost of rebuilding the bridge for six lines of road traffic. Nevertheless, the Council must, we think, reserve the right to raise the question of a grant at any appropriate time, especially having regard to London&apos;s great contribution to the Road Fund.&quot;     The report went on to recommend the Council &quot;to end the ten years controversy and indecision on this question .... by taking immediate steps for the rebuilding of the bridge,&quot;      The effect of loss of the grant of, say,  777,000(60 per cent of  1*295,000) upon the rates was examined and the Committee recorded their sense of the &quot;inequity of the
coat of a project of this character having to he borne by the ratepayers of London alone and not as to 60 per cent, out of the Road Fund, to which London contributes so largely. Nevertheless we believe that if the Council adopts our recommendation its action will be supported by the great body of public opinion in London and will be fully justified by future traffic developments1&apos;.The Finance Committee decided to sanction the enlargement of the purposes of the maintenance vote f or 1934-35 so as to cover the expenditure in that year on Waterloo Bridge.In informing me that their Money Bill of the present Session will again include provisions empowering them to borrow in respect of the anticipated expenditure during the financial year 1935/6,  the Council once more say that they are &quot;strongly of the opinion that it is not equitable that the ratepayers should have to bear the whole of the expenditure involved in the reconstruction of the bridge and that no grant should be forthcoming from the Road Fund towards the cost of a Y/ork which ?/ill make a most important addition to the cross-river facilities for traffic in London&quot;.I am asked to treat the letter as a formal application for grant from the Road Fund towards the cost of the new bridge and ancillary works and it will, I think, be necessary for me to state the*  position of the Government on the Second Reading of the Bill.      It will probably not be regarded as satisfactory simply to say that if Parliament decides to allow the County Council to include provisions for borrowing for their scheme in the Money Bill of the present Session, we will then consider whether cr not to make a grant. It appears to me that Parliament will desire to know, and is
144- ^ -entitled to know, whether or not we should regard a decision of Parliament to allow the Council to &quot;borrow for the purposes of its scheme,  as removing the embargo on a grant imposed by their previous decision and whether, in the event of s. decision favourable to the Council, we should make a grant at the rate which a work of this kind would normally attract,   (60 per cent),  or not,, I think it probable that the principal reason which has led the Council to take the course which they now propose is to make it possible for them to raise the question of grant.At the same time the formal issue before the House will be, as it was on previous occasions, whether or not the Council should be permitted to borrow. The   following courses seem to be open to us:-(l)   We could say that Parliament by refusing the application for borrowing powers last Session expressed in effect its disapproval of the proposal to pull down the existing bridge;    and that the Government regard that decision as conclusive and will not therefore in any circumstances be prepared to renew the offer of a grant to the scheme -which the Council have decided to carry out in despite of the Parliamentary decision,,We should then presumably not be concerned to prevent the Council from meeting their expenditure by borrowing.      Indeed to urge deletion of the borrowing provision might expose us to the charge of desiring to impose burdens unfairly on the present ratepayers with the motive of prejudicing the party now in office.      On the other hand,  to urge the House to grant the borrowing powers
would involve us in a minor issue and might give rise to difficulty in view of the feeling which exists on the matter. If course (l) he taken, the question of financial method could, therefore, I suggest, best be left to be decided in accordance with ordinary private bill procedure, unprejudiced &quot;by the controversy surrounding the scheme itself.(2)    The second course would be to treat Parliamentary approval of the borrowing power sought in the Bill as removing the ban imposed by previous decisions.      This v*/ould be consistent with the attitude of the Government last year, especially in view of the Government&apos;s previous acceptance of the scheme, and appears to me to he the fairest and most suitable course to adopt.      In that case, I should inform the House that if Parliament approves the provisions for &quot;borrowing in respect of the new bridge, the Government will take that action as an expression of Parliament&apos;s view that the question of a grant should be judged on its merits, apart from the old controversy, and that subject to details and estimates a grant will be made at the normal rate.      (It would also be necessary to stipulate that the design should be approved by the Royal Pine Art Commission.)(5)   A statement might be made to the effect that approval of the hoiiowing powers will involve reconsideration by the Government of their refusal of a grant, which was based on the rejection by Parliament of the borrowing powers included in last year&apos;s Bill, and that I am not in a position.to make any definite statement of the Government&apos;s attitude until we know Parliament&apos;s decision, hut that we shall exercise our discretion in view of all the circumstances after Parliament has finally dealt with the Council&apos;s Bill.      For the reasons I have already given I think that this would be the least satisfactory course of all, and I recommend course  (2)
