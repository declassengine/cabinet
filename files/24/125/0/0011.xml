THIS DOOmMT IS THE EROEEJRTY Of HIS BRBJANHIC MAJESTYTS GOTONMENT. S E C g E T. CABINET.T.C.303. SUPPH AMD TRMSPOKT.Demobilisation of Emergency Services.Memorandum by Chairman of Sub-Committee,At its meeting thiB morning tho Sub-Committee had under consideration the question as to the possibility of reducing the expenditure which is at present being incurred in connection with the arrangements which wero made in view of the probability of a Triple Alliance strike, and there was an opinion expressed generally that substantial savings were possible without danger, and that it might be advisable to reduce the organisation to a point approaching the one necessary for dealing with the coal strike only.     I was not able to obtain acourate financial estimates but these oan be forthcoming at short notice.    The services affected would appear to be as follows;(1) Awmiim.fa)   Ships which are at stations convenient for the carrying of yeast.(b)   Ships which are at stations in connection with the wireless soheme and which are not required at those places for other purposes.A rough estimate was that a saving of  800 a day oould be effected by releasing these ships from their present duty, and that thefull scheme for dealing with yeast oould be re-established, say we 96 hours, and further that the removal of the communicationships would not seriously imperil the operation of the wirelessscheme which is based upon land stations and also upon some ships which would be allowed to remain.(g)   AS TO FOOD ORGANISATION.Captain Penney was of opinion that as a very roughestimate  10,000 per weok oould he saved by reducing theorganisation.
(3)   AS TO ELEOTBIOAI SERVICES,The extra cost of maintaining^the..ooaval^ratings In London was roughly calculated at  100 per day, hut the position, at the pewer stations was not sufficiently settled to warrant these units &quot;being returned to their ordinary stations. (4)   OFFICE OF K0RKB PREPARATIONS,Seme substantial savings could he effected by giving up premises which are being held in readiness and distributing stores which have Veen accumulated, for example, bedding.If a general authority is given the various sub-committees concerned shall at once be asked.to consider the matter in detail and to make such reductions as they each think may properly be done without endangering the position.The demobilisation would be, as previously intimated, to a basis almost approaching that of a coal strike.A.
