409 vV(SHIS DOOUMEM IS &apos;XHE PKQKKTY Oi? HIS BKIMHIC HtAJESTY&apos;3 GOVSiiMBM)C A B I M E !g ,   &apos;International Labour Conventions and Hecommendations: the formal machinery for ratification, for announcing non-ratification, and for dealing with liecommendations.iffiMPRAMPm BY TBS MIglSjJgR Off LABOUR.^, 3?J*      l&apos;       *n view of ^ debate in the House of Commons on CP.3068.   87th May with regard to the Washington International Labour Conventions, it is desirable that those Conventions which can be ratified should be ratified at once, and that the machinery for ratification of draft Conventions, for &apos; announcing non-ratification and for dealing with Recommenda-tions 3hould be settled forthwith.   These points were considered originally by an interdepartmental Committee of legal advisers, including Sir Cecil Hurst, and have more recently been examined in detail by the International Labour Committee.   This latter Committee, of which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour is Chairman, includes representatives of the Home Office, the Foreign and Colonial Offices, the Board of Trade, and other Departments concerned.   4s a result of this examination I now submit for the consideration of my colleagues the conclusions set forth below,2,       In addition, the Law Officers of the Crown have been asked to advise on the whole question of the interpretation of Article 405, and have novi communicated their formal opinion, of which the following are the main points .*
(cs) Great Britain is not bound to adopt any other than the usual constitutional methods for the fulfilment of its obligations and the Grown, acting through the Executive government, is the &quot;Member&quot; in all oases, (b) Che &quot;Authority&quot; varies in different cases -i, Heoommendations.Where effeot cannot be given without legis-lotion, the &quot;authority&quot; is the whole legislature;Where effect can be given by executive action, the &quot;authority&quot; is the government. ii. Draft qpnyentions,.The &quot;authority&quot; is invariably the treaty making authority, i,e, the Crown, acting upon the advioe oi the Executive Government. If the &quot;authority&quot; decides to ratify it must do so, and take the necessary legislative or executive action.   Legislative proposals are submitted to parliament only when the &quot;authority has decided to ratify. The above indicates the legal position, but my colleagues will bear in mind that it has been decided as a matter of policy to give opportunity for further discussion of the Draft Convention on Hours on Friday next, July 1st, (c) Communication to Parliament in the oase of a Reoommendation presents unexpected technical difficulties, and the matter is under furtherconsideration but it is not at the moment urgent.o&quot;* *&quot;*
(ci) h.11 iie commendations and Draft Conventions must however, be considered by the &quot;authority whether the British delegates at the Conference supported them or not, c. The International Labour Committee have taken intoconsideration the Law Officers&apos; opinion and I now submit for the consideration oi my colleagues the following conclusions.4-. The Washington Conventions which can be ratifiedwithout question, concerning whioh an announcement was made in the House of Commons,- are:-a) Draft Convention concerning Unemployment; adopted at Washington on  8th November,1919,b) Draft Convention concerning employment of women during the night; adopted at Washington on  8th Uovember,1919.c) Draft Convention fixing the minimum age for admission of children to industrial employ-ment; adopted at Washington on  8th November,1919.d) Draft Convention concerning night work of young pe. sons employed in industry; adopted at Washington on 28th November,1919.In addition, one other Convention can be ratifiedforthwith, i.ej-e) Draft Convention fixing the minimum age for admission of children to employment at sea; adopted at Genoa on 9th July,1920,6, In the ot.se of Draft Conventions, the questions whioharise with regard to their ratification are as follows:-(a) The form in which ratification should be conveyed where there is no question as to the government&apos;s readiness to ratify unconditionally:,(b) :7hether ratification with reservation is possible:(c) The form of instrument for non-ratification,
6.        tfith regard to unconditional ratification, it is recommended that the formal instrument Bhould take tho form of an Order of Council.    Such an instrument has several advantages -(a) it preserves the Royal i?rorogativo in matters of ratification;(b) it is of more permanent character than a Departmental letter;,(c) while preserving the Royal Prerogative, it has the further advantage that it does not involve executive action by tho King,   The Foreign Ofiioe and the Colonial Office both feel very strongly that the formal r&amp;tifi-cation ought to be made on behalf of the United Kingdom in a form similar to that in which it is made on behalf of the Dominions; but at the present stage of constitutional development a difficulty is presented by the suggestion that the King should act on the direct advice of his Dominion Ministers. All other possible instruments of ratifica-tion involve action by the King, and Orders of Council have accordingly been preferred. It is expected that an analogous procedure will be adopted by the self-governing Dominions.    The Indian Government propose &quot;to ratify by means of a formal letter signed by tho Secretary of State, but not acting in Council.V. The question of the possibility of ratification withreservations has been under consideration by the Law Officers of the Crown,   They consider that ordinarily ratification with
roeorvilions is cquivclent to conditional ratification and as suoh is technically intdmissablo.      They hold, however, that the ordinary rules cannot bo appliod in their ontiroty to tho International Labour Conventions, which do not embody even a preliminary agreement between the representstivos of the High Contracting Parties.    The^ incline accordingly to the view that if policy so requires it is competent for Great Britain to ratification;, with reservations.    The possibility of suoh ratification may therefore be considered, and if my colleagues decide thet it is desirable, it is suggestea that heie also an Order of Council might be the formal instrument, and that the necessary reservations could be set out in a schedule.8. V/ith regard to the question oi the form of instrument for announcing non-ratification, it is recommended that in this cese a less formal instrument oould be used, as it is not impossible that the decision of the Government not to retify any particular Convention may be modified in the future.   It is considered, therefore, that a formal departmental letter would be sufficient in this case.0. A Draft of the Orders of Council in respect of thefive Conventions cited in paragraph  . above is attached. The:.e is attached, in addition, a specimen Draft Order of Council in respect of any Convention which it is desired to ratify with reservations.10. With regard to Recommendations, the 6th paragraphof Article 405 of the Treaty of &quot;Versailles lays down that &quot;in the caie oi a Recommendation, kembers will inform the Secretary-General of the action taken&quot;.   It is recommended that to comply with this, paragraph, it v/ould probably be sufficient if the Department concerned addressed a formal let,er to the International Labour Committee setting forth
the action taken.    The Committee would then forward this letter to the Secretary of the Cabinet with a request that the information might he transmitted to the Secretary-General of the League of Nationa.11. In view of the importance of the precedents whiohdecisions on these questions will establish, I asK the Cabinet to give their formal approval to the recommendations of the International Labour Committee.(Signed) ff. j. micmviaba.ministry of Labour^ June 2 rdT19gl.
