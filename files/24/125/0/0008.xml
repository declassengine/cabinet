(&quot;this document IS the property op his BRITAMlfc! MAJESTY&apos;s GOVERNMENT). 8 eg b e to Copy Wo.cup?- .300O0C A b i n e riv THE iljjzpsift TRIALS a ftfemorandum by the Solicitor-General.At the suggestion of the lord Chancellor i circulate the following Memorandum^On arrival at Leipzig the first point dealt with was whether the British Government should be joined aa a Co-Plaintiff in the proceedings.      This course was open to us under the procedure of the Court, as Parties who had suffered from the acts of the accused;   and the Germans were anxious that we should adopt it, so as to give us a locus standi at the trials.i decided against this on the ground:-a) That responsibility would by this course bo attributed to the British Government by reason of their intervention, if anything wont wrong at the trials;   and b) That it was inconsistent with the Note to the Allies when accepting the offer of the Germans to try the cases before the Supreme Court of Leipzig.     The Note had emphasised that the Allies threw the full and entire&apos; responsibility upon the Germans and declined to intervene in the Proceedings, Prosecutions and Judgments.We agreed with the State Attorney, that we should be able to pass him a note if any correction or oversight&apos; had to be made or corrected - and this system worked quite satisfactorily.The Court of seven Judges impreused me with their capacity and impartiality.     The president was a man who34
recalled the qualities of the late Sir A.L.Smith - able, direct, of strong common sense, and a desire to get at the truth:     at the samo time sympathetic and patient with the witnesses and possessing a sense of h j80tt3?*      He was distinctly severe upon the German witnesses and the Military AssessorsiThe evidenoc was takenn as in a CoronerTs Court here, by the President himselfi    Ho examined all the witnesses and sometime^ confronted one witness With another.In the first case, that against Heynenj the evidence upon somo of ovx charges broke down, or were left not proven?   o*g, the charge of having brutally subjected a Prisoner named Cro^s, now dead, to alternate douohes of hot and cold water, whereby he was rendered insane; Two of. our witnesses said in their evidence that Cross was already insane before this incident took place, and gave, as the reason that they knew he was insane, his dirty habits.The following are two excerpts from the Judgment of the Go^rt under which Heynen was found guilty and sentenced to ten months imprisonment.&quot;This Court has come to the conclusion that the evidence of the English Witnesses has proved on the whole to be thoroughly trustworthy.&quot;&quot;Orle cannot help acknowledging that here it is a case of oxtom-q/ly      rough acts of brutality, aggravate^ by the fact that they were perpetrated against defenceless prisoners, against whom one should have acted in the most proper manner if the good reputation-tion of the German Army, and the respect of the German Cation, as a Nation of culture, were to be upheld.&quot;o
The sentence was not considered light by the Military Officers in Court.      It is equivalent to a sentence of imprisonment with hard labour and has to be served in prison dress in an ordinary prison, among thieves and other felons.      It dates from tha commencement of the Trial; and the arrest of the prisoner is a matter for the police after the Judgment has been drawn up.     I tool-: care to ascertain that there was no possibility of the prisoner escaping and that it will be duly served.Detective Inspector Collins, who was in charge of our Witnesses and has had 25 years experience at the Old Bailey, expressed his opinion to me that, in view of the provocation given by our men, and. the necessity for enforcing discipline, a prisoner in a similar case at the Old Bailey would have been sentenced to 9-11 months imprisonment.In the Mueller ease, the evidence was practically complete before I left Leipsig.     Cur Prisoners went to Flavy-Lo-Martel Camp early in April and it was provetk that Mueller, the Commandant, left on May 4th.     Thus he was not responsible for all teat nappened during the detention oT our prisoners there.     Some of the., charge a against him failed;   e.g. those of misconduct at the burials of our men -a charge to which the President attached great importance. The evidence as to this was not strong enough to establish proof.     The sentence of six months imposed in this case seems too short according to jnx-lieh &amp;t...canada,&apos;-,rds;   but in as much as the imprisonment (in contradistinction to mere detention in a fortress), carries a stigma with it, it is impossible to regard it, when imposed upon a man who was a Barrister and an Officer, as otherwise than a serious sentence.The outstanding- features of the trials were, to
my mind, that, the -Court acted impartially, with a manifest desire to get at the truth, under a President of great force of character and sincerity, who succeeded in placing our witnesses at their ease and extracting their evidence fairly from them.   The State attorney presented the case against Heynen forcibly and there is no complaint to be made against his conduct of it.finally, the declarations made, not merely in the Judgment but by the criticisms of the President delivered in the course of the case against the conduct of the Military, appear to me of deep and lasting importance.   The Supreme Court of Germany has declared that auoh conduct cannot be tolerated.   It administered a sharp rebuke to General fransecky, in the course of the case, for the attitude which he adopted; and while the British Public may have desired and expected more startling sentences, the moral effect of the condemnation by the Court of the abuses of the Military system is of greater importance than the mere quantum of the sentence and should have a wide-reaching and permanent effect.AS to the other cases which we have selected for trial, Werner, the Offioer vvho after sinking the &quot;S.S. Torrington&quot;, collected the survivors of the crew on the deck of the submarine and then submerged, I ascertained that he fled from Germany as soon as the original list of War Criminals was published.   An order of arrest has been issued for him,&apos; and&apos; the Germans assured me that they were anxious to catcj? him;   His Mother lives In Weimar, his property has been sequestrated, and the Police will continue their efforts, but so far they have been unable to trace him,Trinke, who ought to have been charged at the same
B 8time as Neumann, is believed to be in Poland, and the German Police have been unable to procure his arrest. atzig, who sank the hospital snip &quot;Iilandovery Castle&quot;, is said io be in the director City of1 Danzig.    The State Attorney ioid md that the1 Police had just succeeded in arresting twd Officers who served under hiirii and that they would be pitodeeded against.   I have taken steps to ascertain what dharges they intend to prefer a^ainsi these men, but I have not Jret received the information.Lt. Cdmttiander Neumann, who sank&apos; the hospital ship &quot;Dover Castle&quot;, pleads &quot;superior ordare&quot; and has produced the order on which he acted.   The effect of this in law will, as I understand, be discussed and decided by the Supreme Court at:a hearing on Saturday, June 4th.&apos;The behaviour of our Witnesses, over 50 in number, wkile in Court and during their stay at Xeipzig, was excellent: and those wno arranged for their journey and loo-feed after them deserve much praise*(intd, j  d.
