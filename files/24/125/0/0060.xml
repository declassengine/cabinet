The interdepartmental conference auggested by the War Office has not taken place.Briefly, the supply of tradesmen to the Army by voluntary enlistment, already acutely difficult before the Great War, has since been shown by experience to be impossible, especially in view of the larger numbers of tradesmen required in consequence of the growth of the mechanical factor in war. After the fullest consideration the Army Council reached the conclusion that no practicable alternative was open to it but to follow the course already adopted by the Navy and Air Force and train its own artificers.A school for 1,000 boys is proposed, not because that number will fully meet the requirements of the Army, but because it is the largest number that it is desirable to concentrate in one school, and before going further it is desired to await the final settlement of future Army establishments. The scheme, as drawn up, provides a smaller proportion of instructional and administrative staff to boys than obtains in the Navy and Air Force schools. If experience should show the possibility of further economies, they will be made. The site selected is Blandford Camp, now in the hands of the Disposals Commission, and the total capital expenditure of 323,000?. includes 90,000Z. for payment to the Commission as the value of land and buildings. The remainder is for conversion of huts to quarters, &amp;c, and for the equipment of the necessary workshops.   The necessary provision has been made in Army Estimates.The annual cost of maintenance, when the school is in full operation, is estimated at 156,000/. This cost will not be reached until the third year, as provision must be made for a regular flow of pupils through the school in a 3-year course. Considerable as the cost of the school will be, the scheme affords the cheapest way of getting the indispensable tradesmen for the Apmy.As in the corresponding establishments of the other Services, it is considered necessary that the staff of the school should consist of Service personnel. Not only has this the advantage of administrative convenience at a detached site like Blandford Camp; but it is essential that the school and its pupils should be military in tone and should not be allowed to fall under trades unionist influences. At the same time, no difficulty is anticipated (in view of experience elsewhere) in securing that men trained at this school, and afterwards in the Army, shall be accepted as tradesmen on leaving the Army for civil employment.The War Office,20th June, 1921. L.W.-E.42/Misc./1034.  (F. 2.)Sir, 11th February, 1921.I am commanded to state for the information of Their Lordships that the Army Council have had under their consideration the provision of tradesmen for the Army.For some years before the war it was found increasingly difficult to recruit the tradesmen required in the Army from civil life and during the past two years, owing to(b21/223)  .100  6/21   h&amp;s, ltd  9271wo
the high rates of wages paid to such men by civil employers and other causes, the difficulty has been still further accentuated, Various expedients to attract tradesmen have been tried but the results have been negligible, and even in the present period of acute unemployment no improvement is observable. The Army Council are satisfied that it is no longer possible to continue to rely on the recruitment of tradesmen from civil life, and that the training of boys in much larger numbers than before the war is the only practical alternative to the offer of such rates of pay as would start a new cycle of increases throughout all ranks of the fighting forces, with financial results of the most serious kind.In order to get from the boys so trained the maximum possible non-pensionable service including a period of service in the reserve, it is proposed that the terms of service should be 3 ye,ars&apos; boys service (under training), 8 years&apos; colour service and 4 years&apos; reserve service. The boys will be attested at the age of 15 years but will not start to count their service towards the legal period of 12 years&apos; engagement until they attain the age of 18 years, a practice which has been found to work well in the case of boys in the Royal Navy.On this principle and after making deductions for all provision that can reasonably be expected from sources outside the Army and for existing resources for training boys within the Army, it is estimated that from 300 to 400 trained men should be turned out annually the exact number depending on the future size and composition of the Army. It is therefore proposed that a new central school should be established to hold 1,000 boys which is regarded as the maximum number it is desirable to collect in one institution. The boys would enter the school in batches of about 110 every 4 months by means of an Entrance Examination, the qualifying standard being fixed as high as possible consistent with obtaining sufficient candidates.The site proposed for the school is Blandford Camp which has been examined and found very suitable for adoption.The Instructional Staff should, in principle, it is considered be military, but if a sufficient number of suitable military instructors is not available, it is proposed to employ civilians up to a proportion not exceeding 50 per cent.The Instructional officer staff will be paid at regimental rates, plus extra pay of 2s. 6d. per day, except the Chief Instructor, who will receive extra pay of 5s. a day. Rates of pay for the Civil Instructional Staff will be referred for their Lordships&apos; sanction, if and when it should be found necessary to employ civilian instructors.Instructors would be provided at the approximate rate of one to every 15 boys trained in ordinary trades, and one to every 10 boys in highly skilled trades where more supervision and individual attention is necessary. This proportion is understood to be low in comparison with that adopted by the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force.Tables are enclosed showing the Instructional Staff and Establishment of Staff for General and Technical Education, together with the Headquarters and Administrative Staff for a school of 1,000 boys. Some Medical Establishment will also be necessary. It is not considered practicable to combine the duties of Commandant and Chief Instructor.The school would not attain its full number of boys for 3 years, and would not, therefore, require its full staff at once.Apart from the book value of buildings (75,000?.), which it is proposed to ask the Air Ministry to transfer to this Department, the capital cost is estimated to be as follows : 	For 1921-22.	Total.	 	 	15,000	15,000Barrack accommodation, including married quar-	33,000 .	112,000ters for staff.		.

Votes, the only cost to the Exchequer being the loss of the sale value of the hutments as they stand. Formal sanction for works services will be separately applied for in due course.The annual running costs when the school is full are estimated to be  Maintenance      ......    -.........      34,550Staff      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      61,500Boys      ..................      60,000Total      ...      ...    156,050of which some 43,850?, will be required in 1921-22, assuming a start on 1st July, the earliest date that now seems possible. The total cost of this scheme, and the provision to be made in 1921-22 are considerable sums which the Army Council would gladly have avoided placing on the Estimates under the financial conditions of to-day; but with the increasingly mechanical character of war and the growing reluctance of trained mechanics to enlist, they considered the scheme to be of fundamental importance and of the greatest urgency, and they submit it for their Lordships&apos; early sanction, subject to provision in Estimates.I am, &amp;c, (Sd.)     B. B. Ctjbitt.The Secretary, The Treasury.Treasury Chambers,Whitehall, S.W. 1.My Dear Worthington-Evans, 22nd February, 1921.I have had before me the official letter from your Department, dated the 11th instant, in which our sanction is asked for the institution of a central school at which 1,000 boys may be trained to act as tradesmen for the Army. My own impression is that the proposal is probably sound in principle, but that considerable improvement could be made in the details of the scheme, and substantial economies effected. But before I come to a definite decision, I should be grateful if you would examine the proposal personally from these two different aspects. If you think that the proposal is right in principle, and that the present difficulties in regard to the provision of tradesmen for the Army render such action necessary, would it not be possible&quot; to work out a scheme on improved and more economical lines ? I am not at all satisfied in regard to the details of the present scheme.Yours sincerely, (Sd.)     Austen Chamberlain..The Eight Hon. Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, Bart., M.P.3,3/General No./187.My Dear Chamberlain, 3rd March, 1921.I have looked into the question which you raised in your letter to me of the 22nd February, about the central schoel for training boys as tradesmen for the Army.We are in acute difficulties as regards the supply of tradesmen for the Army and I am satisfied, after consulting the Adjutant-General and Sir Charles Harris, that the proposal to establish a school is right in principle.With regard to details, I a.m not quite clear from your letter in what direction you consider that economies or improvements can be made. I do not, of course, pretend that there may not be details of organizations susceptible of improvement when the scheme comes to be put into practice, but I think perhaps the most advantageous way of dealing with the question would be for the Treasury to reply to our official letter of(9271) a 2 .
the 11th February indicating what improvements or economies you have in contemplation, when we should be very glad to arrange a conference to discuss actual details.With regard to Sir Howard Frank&apos;s memorandum which you mentioned in your postscript, I am seeing Sir Howard Frank again, and I will certainly speak to you about the question.Yours sincerely,(Sd.)   L. WORTHINGTON-EVANS.The Rt. Hon. J. Austen Chamberlain, M.P.4.42/Misc-./1034 (W.F.).Sir, 26th February, 1921.In continuation of War Office letter of the 11th instant, number as above, I am commanded by the Army Council to acquaint you that it is proposed, subject to Treasury sanction to insert in Army Estimates 1921-22 a Part I. item, under Head V. subhead B. for the adaptation, as a training centre for boys, of Blandford Camp, lately occupied by the Royal Air Force.Blandford is found to be well adapted for such a purpose. Situated in a healthy locality it is well equipped in the important matter of water supply, drainage and electric lighting, while most of the buildings are suitable, or can be made suitable at relatively small cost, for their new appropriation.Of the total capital expenditure shown in War Office letter of the 11th instant, the following are the items chargeable to Part I.  Barrack accommodation  ...      ...      ...      ...   112,000Workshop accommodation        ...      ...      ...      6,000Plant and erection ............    35,000Total............   153,000To this sum must be added the value of existing buildings, estimated at 75,000?. bringing the total provisional estimate for the Part I. items up to 228,000?. The expenditure in 1921-22 is estimated at some 20,000?., in addition to the payment to the Disposals Board on account of the existing buildings, which is of course a mere bookkeeping transaction between Departments.The greater part of the expenditure on barrack accommodation will be incurred in the conversion of huts into married quarters for the instructional and disciplinary staff.&apos; The workshops and plant will be designed to include machinery typical of the best manufacturing methods and capable of illustrating all the principal operations of modern workshop practice in the trades concerned, together with types of engines and other machinery in common use in the Army. Much of this plant will be obtainable from Army sources or from the material in the hands of the Disposals Board and will not therefore represent fresh expenditure from the Exchequer.The land, valued provisionally at 15,000?., is held under the Defence of the Realm Act and the question of its purchase will be separately referred to you. - -I am accordingly to solicit sanction for the proposed Part I. item, subject to provision of the necessary funds in Estimates.I am, &amp;c,(Sd.)  B. B. Cubitt.The Secretary, The Treasury, S.W.1.
6.. 42/Misc./1049 (P. 2).  &quot;War Office,Sir, 18th April, 1921.With reference to Treasury letter No. S. 7792 of the 10th ultimo, I am commanded to inform you that the Army Council have carefully reconsidered, in the light of Their Lordships&apos; observations, the scheme for the establishment of a school for training boys as tradesmen for the Army, but that they are unable to effect any of the modifications suggested.As regards the size of the school, I am to enclose the table asked for in your letter (Annexure A.). The figures are those prepared for the departmental consideration of the scheme, and, though they are not now exact, they show so large a number of boys at school to be required (2,800) that they fully justify the proposal for 1,000 boys. All possible efforts to obtain trained mechanics for the Army have been made both since and before the war, and it is clearly established by experience that, while the Army is becoming increasingly mechanical, it is impossible to secure the necessary numbers by recruiting. It would, of course, in any case be unsound to look to the results obtained in a period of abnormal unemployment as affording a solution of the problem, and the Council trust that Their Lordships will accept their assurance that a school of 400 boys would be so inadequate as not to be worth proceeding with.During the preparation of the details of this scheme information was obtained as to the organization of similar institutions under the control of the Navy and the Air Force.   In both cases the staff is found from service personnel, and the proportion, bothS. 7792.Sir, 10th March, 1921.I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury Sir B. Cubittfs letters of the 11th and 26th ultimo (42/Misc./1034 (I. 2), (42/Misc./1034 (W.F.)), relative to the establishment of an institution for training boys for service as tradesmen in the Army.In reply I am to requuest you to inform the Army Council that while My Lords are prepared to concur in principle in the adoption of this scheme, they are disposed to think that for the present, at any rate, it should be developed on more modest lines, the number of boys under training being reduced with a corresponding reduction of staff and accommodation.As the Army Council are aware, the Eoyal Naval College at Osborne will shortly be vacant, and if no more suitable use can be found for it either by your Department or by the Air Ministry it might be possible to utilize it for the training of boy mechanics. My Lords understand that Osborne would provide accommodation for rather over 400 boys.In this connection My Lords would be glad to be furnished with a table showing as regards the tradesman classes (or a fair selection of such classes) the number normally and actually required for Army personnel, and the actual recruitments during recent months, and to be informed whether any special steps are being taken to stimulate recruiting for special Army trades in localities where unemployment in those trades is rife.My Lords consider also that the military organizationsproposed is unduly expensive, and that the cost might be reduced by placing the school under civilian teachers and staff, subject to the general supervision of a military commandant.My Lords would be glad if the Army Council would cause a revised scheme to be prepared on these lines, and the establishment and works services involved to be submitted for their approval.I am to add that if it is decided to proceed with the acquisition of Blandford Camp, payment must be made to the Disposals Board for the buildings taken over in the ordinary manner at an agreed valuation, and provision must be made accordingly in the Estimates for 1921-22 unless payment can be made in the current financial year.I am, &amp;c, (Sd.)     G. L. Barstow.The Secretary, War Office.

There is at present a very large deficiency of tradesmen to be made good.of instructional staff and of administrative staff proposed by the Council, is smaller than that prevailing in either.In the Army School administrative staff is estimated at the approximate rate of 1 to every 8 boys, as compared with 1 to every 7&apos;6 boys in the Eoyal Air Force Schools and 1 to every 4 boys in the Royal Navy School. Similarly, instructional staff is estimated in the Army School at theN approximate rate of 1 to every 10&apos;4 boys, as compared with 1 to every 8 boys in the Royal Air Force School and 1 to every 4 boys of the Royal Navy School. (The figures for the Royal Navy School are given with reserve, as some difficulty has been experienced in ascertaining accurately what part of the total staff employed there is properly included in the comparison.)The figures given in the War Office letter of the 11th February (instructors at the approximate rate of 1 to every 15 boys trained in ordinary trades and 1 to every 10 boys in highly skilled trades) referred to men graded as &quot;instructors&quot; only; the figures now given represent the total numbers of the instructional staff, including mechanics, &amp;c.There are, moreover, important reasons of policy for staffing this school with soldiers (so far as suitable instructors, &amp;c, are available) in preference to civilians, and the existing accommodation and arrangements at Blandford are more readily adaptable for a school of military type.Provision is made in Army Estimates of 1921-22 for the necessary payment to the Disposals Board and for the other expenditure involved, and I am to express the hope that Their Lordships will now be pleased to give their early sanction to the scheme proposed. If any further information is desired I am to suggest that to avoid further delay the matter should be discussed by representatives of the two-departments. . *I am, &amp;c, (Sd.)     B. B.

8.-42/Misc./1062 (F. 2).War Office,;Sir, 20th June, 1921,In reply to Treasury letter of the 17th ultimo, on the proposed Training School for mechanics for the Army, I am commanded by the Army Council to send you the enclosed copy of a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War submitting the scheme for Cabinet approval.No figure for the present deficiency of tradesmen in the Army was given in the War Office letter of 18 th April, because any such figure must depend on the establishments of the various branches of the Army, which are not yet settled, and on the actual strength which, with men joining and leaving the Army every day, could only be ascertained by calling for special returns from all units and would he out of date before it could be brought to bear. But on such general information as is available, the deficiency at the beginning of this month was estimated to be in the neighbourhood of 6,000.As regards failure to reply to the enquiry whether any special steps are being taken to stimulate recruiting in centres of unemployment, it was thought that the point would be sufficiently covered by the statement in the letter of 18th- April that &apos;&quot; all possible efforts to obtain trained mechanics for the Army have been made.&quot; The fact that unemployment is the recruiters opportunity is thoroughly familiar to all members of the recruiting department and extra staff, special advertisements, increased rewards7.     -    &apos; &apos;  &apos; i &apos; y    &apos;-:S./7792.Treasury Chambers,Sir, 17th May, 1921.I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury Sir B. -Cubittfs letter of the 18th ultimo (42/Misc./1049 F.  2), further respecting the establishment of an institution for training boys for service as tradesmen in the Army, and in reply I am to request you to lay before the Army Council the following observations: 2. My Lords note from the table annexed to Sir B. Cubittfs letter that the total establishment of tradesmen required is approximately 17,000, of which it is estimated that 11,000 can be normally maintained by recruiting, leaving a further 6,000 to be provided, and that it is estimated that 2,000 boys at school will be necessary for this purpose. They observe, however, that the actual shortage of tradesmen at the present time, which is stated to be considerable, is not given; nor is an answer furnished to their Lordship&apos;s enquiry, whether any special steps are being taken to stimulate recruiting for special Army trades in localities where unemployment in these trades is rife. They would be glad to be furnished with information on these points as requested in their letter of 10th March last (S. 7792).3. Their Lordships would further desire to be informed what are the important reasons of policy referred to in the letter under reply, which in the opinion of the Army Council make it desirable that the staff of the proposed school should be composed of soldiers in preference to civilians.4. Their Lordships have already indicated their agreement in principle with the formation of the proposed school. But in their view a new scheme of this magnitude, involving capital expenditure of 233,000?. falls within the terms of Treasury Circular of 17th December, 1920 (F. 2365), and should in accordance with the decision of His Majesty s Government be submitted for Cabinet approval. My Lords are willing that the Secretary of State for War should seek this authority forthwith, provided that the . submission to the Cabinet is accompanied by copies of the correspondence between the War Office and this Department, including the reply of the Council to the enquiries contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 of my letter.I am, &amp;c, (Sd.)     K. S. Meiklejohn.
and other measures have been tried, in centres of unemployment and generally, with results that only confirm the Councils view that the problem does not admit of solution on these lines. Moreover, as pointed out in the letter of 18th April, the results, obtained in a period of abnormal unemployment, however good, could not be regarded as solving the permanent problem. The Council trust that Their Lordships will now be prepared to accept their assurances on this point or, to save protracted correspondence, will adopt the suggestion already twice made, that any further information on points of detail should be obtained by conference.The reasons of policy referred to in the third paragraph of your letter on which it \ras considered undesirable to enlarge in official correspondence, are indicated in the Cabinet Memorandum.I am, &amp;c, (Sd.)     B. B. Cubitt,The Secretary, Treasury.
