462THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 03? HIS ERITAMIC MAJESTY&apos;S (HOTRNJGHT.)SECRET, Copy-Ho..%f.i   &apos;CABINET.c..p. 3071*REPORT. W THE GENERAL OFFICER COMMAJKTpIlTG-I3sT-CHIEF OB THE SITUATION IN IRELAND FOR WEEK ENDING l8th JUNE , 1921.(Circulated by the Secretary of State for War.)There has been no change in the situation during the week.There have been several eases of attacks on troops or polio in Dublin, and the murder of ex-soldiers and loyalists continues in the Country.    A retired Church of Ireland Clergyman, the Very Rev. Dean Finlay was brutally murdered at his home  Bear Bawnboy, Co* Cavan, at 2 aim. on the 12th. and his hcuse burnt, probably owing to the fact that Aux.Police recently inspected the house with a view to occupying it.Four of the reinforcing battalions have arrived in Ireland and have been located as follows:*1st. Northumberland Fus. Curragh1st. Royal Sussex Regt. Curragh2nd. JR. W. Kant &quot; Dublin.1st. Middlesex w BelfastThe last named Battalion will be moved to County Cavan after the completion of the ceremony of the opening of Parliament in Belfast on 22nd.Attempts havo been made by the rebels to interfere with the transport by rail of two of these battalions.On the 14th. an attempt was made to derail the troop train containing the 1st. H. Fusiliers near Drumcondra by removing a rail.   An ambush was also prepared in an adjoining house by about 20 rebels, armed with revolvers, bombs and a machine gun.   Owing to the arrival of a Goods train which was derailed the outrage scheme failed, but no trace was found of the rebels by a patrol which visited the locality as soon as tho information..was obtainsThe train conveying the R.W.Kent Regt. was attacked on the 16th. with bombs and revolver fire resulting in 3 soldiers being wounded, one of whom subsequently died of his wounds.Several ambushes, raids on trains and attaoks on police having taken place during April and Hay in the Area between Killarney and Rathmore, a drive was carried out to make a thorott; investigation of the Area, which being wild and inaccessible is rarely visited by troops.Six columns composed of troops from the 17th. &amp; Kerry Bdes aggregating 18J0 men carried out the drive on the 6th. June, whilst a party of. Auxiliaries co-operated by taking up a positio:-to prevent a.break through.
463The operation involved night approach marches and deploy-ments whioh were troll oarried out in spite of the difficult country and the fact that no previous reconnaissance had &quot;been possible.    Over 100 men were rounded up, some of whom were do-tained, but nothing of any importance was found in the area, the information on which the operation was based being evidently untrue.Three men who refused to halt when called upon were shot and an old man was hit by a recochet.The troops displayed good marching powers and did very good work, and aeroplanes co-operated and dropped messages at Brigade Hd.Qrs. giving position of the troops.Though no important results were obtained the operations proved beneficial as the inhabitants of the Area professed to never having seen a soldier or policeman before, and had naturally come to view the so-called Irish Republic as the ruling power.The operations on which the Cavalry Brigade have been engaged-in Counties Longford, leitrim and Monaghan, during the past three weeks have now been completed^ and a full report will be forwarded to the War Office.    in Co. Monaghan alone some 1650 young men were rounded up out of whom only 21 known I.R.A.Offioers and wanted men wore detained.   Lack of accommo-dation in the Internment oamps precludes the retention of any but the most important rebels.   Similarly for lack of accommodation, operations on a largo scale against the rebels in Dublin have been brought almost to a standstill, only the most influential rebels and those found in possession of arms, or who can be otherwise tried, being retained as the result of the minor operations and searches whioh take place daily.(Signed)   Q.$.$Mcmm.General, Commanding-in-Chief, IRELAND.G.H.Q.
