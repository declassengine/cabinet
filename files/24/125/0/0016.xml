Pj 30X6,11IEXPi&amp;JDITURE OH IHEBRIAL SERVICES Iff IR3LAHDi (Circulated for information, by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.)This Hote deale not with the question of what ireland z contribution (in fact  18,000,000) to Imperial Charges (Debt, Army and Havy etc.,) should be, but with the question how muoh of the Imperial expenditure in fact is paid out in Ireland a* a set off to the Irish contribution.The principal Imperial Services are:-Debt.far Pensions and training etc. of ex-soldiers.Army.ttavy.Air force,The total interest on the internal debt, other than float* ing debt (Treasury Bills and Ways and Means advances) ia eetima* ted for 1921/22 at about  220 millions.   From death duty statistics, it appears that about 2.9 per cent of the 8ecuritj.es of this class are held in Ireland; consequently the expenditure -  in Ireland should be about $6.4 millions per annum, the Irish share of discount on Treasury Bills (estimated at  67imillions) can hardly be loss than  1,000,000 and the Irish share of the 500,000     debt oharge can be safely put at a minimum of      millions.The Ministry of Pensions estimate their expenditure in 000,000     Ireland at  5,000,000 per annum. The Ministry of Labour esti-mate their expenditure on ex-soldiers (training, re-settlement 090,000      etc) in Ireland at  840,000 to which must be added  2?0,000 for ex*service unemployed on the Irish Development Grant. The expenditure of the Irish Local Government Board and the Irish land Commission under the Irish Land (Provision for Soldiers 220,000     and Sailors) Act 1919 is estimated for 1921/22 at  1,220,000. 120,000     A Bum of  120,000 is provided for the higher education of ex* officers under the Vote for Universities and Colleges,Ireland.930,000     Thus the total expenditure of ex-soldiers 1b  5,000,000
for pensions and  2,430,000 for resettlement..,-trajjiing-el^. ,930,000      or nearly  7,500,000 in all.When it comes to the Army, ITavy and Air Force, the calculation &quot;becomes exceedingly difficult.    Expenditure in Ireland should include contracts given to Irish firms, whether the supplies obtained are consumed in Ireland, or Great Britain or overseas.     Unfortunately no data are available as to such contracts.     It should also include remittances home by Irish soldiers serving outside Ireland. It may &quot;be mentioned that about one in twelve of the recruits from the regular Army come from Ireland.     This proportion oannot, of course, be applied to the entire Army expenditure of  106,000,000 but&apos; it suggests that a substantial sum goes into Irish pockets.As to the expenditure on the forces stationed in. Ireland, that of the Air Force is estimated at  443-,000.\per annum, that at the lavy at  800,000 per annum,, and   V that of the Army at  13,^00,000.     But these figures &quot;are swollen by the existing abnormal conditions.     The cost, &quot;at.^ the existing level of prices, etc, of the garrison that was kept in Ireland before the War would be about  5,000., 00QS to which something must be added for the lavy and Air Force. What portion of   this cost is actually spent in Ireland it is quite impossible to say.But on the whole, it is difficult to see how the figure (including contracts) far all three services can ,500,000      normally be less than  2,500,000,     At present it must____  be considerably more.     That would make the total,430,000.     Imperial expenditure in Ireland about  17,430,000.This figure is exclusive of money applied to the redemption of debt.     In so far as the debt redeemed is internal, Ireland gets her proportion, say 2.$ per cent- 2 - for
...4.0Treasury, S.W.1.June 3rd, 1921,for War-Loans and Bonds,- andLsoiiwrthi.^^ debt *Further the figure is exolusive of the amount Of the Railway Agreement Settlement attributable to Ireland. This figure has yet to be settled by negotiation.    It might be several millions spread over 1921/22 and 192^23.
