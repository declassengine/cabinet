The proposed occupation of the European shore of the Dardanelles AS A TEMPORARY MEASURE &quot;would, under existing oondi-tions, be possible &quot;with the present British forces new at Constantinople strengthened by at least one Brigade of medium artillery and the aircraft necessary to act in an auxiliary capacity.3.   The operation is, however, open to tactical and strategical objections, as explained in the three attached Memoranda. 4t   The taotioal situation would be improved by the provision of art additional Brigade supported by artillery to hold a bridgehead round Chanak on the Asiatic shore, 5,   If a prolonged occupation of the Gallipoli peninsula is anticipated the proposal has nothing to recommend it, as the Bolshevik support in men and material (which cannot be left out of account), added to the forces at the disposal of the Turkish Nationalists combine to render the proposal undesirable, objec-tibnable, and indeed impossible with the military forces at our disposal,6,   The object&apos; of the Government in proposing this occupation is stated to be the safeguarding of the passage through the Straits into the Marmora for armoured -warships in order to exert naval pressure at Constantinople.7, It must be pointed out that the only method of exerting pressure available to armoured ships unaccompanied by other
weapons and arras, is bombardment (since the enemy*8 lines of communications are oh land) and this by itself is an incon-clusive operation, especially when it is considered that the nationalist Government are unlikely to expose anything essential to the opnd&amp;ot of the war to the fire of Naval guns, whether at Courtantinople t*r elsewhere9 8,   Under these circumstances, and political considerations apart, it is extremely doubtful whether the results to be achieved would be at. all commensurate with the risks to be run, as outlined in the attached memoranda*(Sgd.)

POSSIBILITIES OP THE PASSAGE OF ARMOURED SHIPS THROUGH THE DARDANELLES with OHLY THE EUROPEAN SHORE IS ALLIED OCCUPATION. -Memorandum by tho Naval Staff.1.        The situation visualised by the Cabinet is one inwhich all Allied Military Forces are withdrawn from the areaBosphorus/and concentrated in the Gallipoli peninsula and on the Bulair lines, -     It is assumed that the whole of the Peninsula would be occupied and the opposite shore of the Straits kept under observation.2.        Under these conditions the Turkish Nationalist forces would be free   to occupy the Asiatic shore of the Dardanelles.5.        Ships attempting the passage would therefore be liable to attack from whatever guns the Turks oould bring up and from aircraft, though the riek of the latter is small.      The General Staff consider that 6-inch howitzers would be the heaviest guns that could be brought to bear in the first few weeks.     After this period material assistance from the Bolsheviks must be taken into account and it is possible that heavier guns would be mounted.4.       With only 6-inch howitzer fire to face, it would be possible for armoured ships to meke the passage without risk of being- sunk, but a well-directed fire in these narrow waters would probably entail severe damage to d^barracks and superstructure and considerable casualties.5.       At the present time the Turks have no naval form of attack at their disposal, but after the first few weeks, it is probable that plenty of mines and torpedoes could be obtained from the Bolsheviks, together with minelaying craft and.... o
and submarines, though the efficiency of tho latter is open to doubt.6.       This would introduce a new and serious faotor into the question, as minesweeping and anti-submarine measures in waters under close fire from the land are not considered prac-tioable and it is probable that under these conditions, the passage could only tie made witfr very Borious risk of loss of Capital Ships.7.      It must be pointed out that the ships would be un-acoompanied by supply vessels or transports and could therefore only operate for a limited period with their own weapons.8,      Except in the early days cf the situation under consideration, it would be necessary for armoured ships to be reinforced by light craft to screen and protect them from the various forms of underwater attack.     It would be possible for these vessels to run the gauntlet of the narrows by night, with the aid of soreenod navigation lights on the European shore, but it must be remembered that the guns in the hands of the Turks aro powerful enough to sink them and the risks would bo considerable.9.        In the opinion of the Naval Staff, it is strategically unsound for vessels of any description to mako a passage through narrow waters, unless both shores are firmly held by friendly military forces, and although it has been&apos; stated above that the passage could be made by taking certain indefinite risks, it cannot be recommended as a naval opera-tion, unless it can be shown that the results to bo antici-pated are commensurate with the risks to be run.Naval-Staff. 2nd June, 1921.
121/3/2193.)MILITARY CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING THE OCCUPATION OF THE GALLIPOLI PENINSULA IN THE EVENT OF CONSTANTINOPLE BEING EVACUATED.Memorandum by the General Staff.To attempt to safeguard the passage of the Dardan-elles even for armoured ships only, by a military occupation which is Confined to the Gollipoli Peninsula, is from a tactical point of view, an extremely unsatisfactory proposi-tion.The Asiatic shore is over 40 miles in length and the average width of the straits is about   miles.     Ships passing up the Dardanelles will therefore be subject to the fire of hostile guns from concealed positions at deci-sive range.Even though the Turkish Nationalists may not be able to produce any guns of greater calibre than 6&quot;, these will be quite sufficient to make the passage of the Straits a difficult and costly operation.If we have no troops on the Asiatic shore, w must rely solely upon medium and heavy artillery established on the Gallipoli Peninsula, assisted by aeroplane observation to prevent as far es possible the establishment of hostile guns in places where they can open direct fire on our ships. It is obvious, however, that at the best this cannot always be successful.If the Asiatic shore is left in-the undisputedpossession of the Turks, they will be able to move upconsiderable forces with the object of malting raids acrossthe Straits under cover of night.    We cannot keep the wholelength of the Straits under continual observation, toprevent this, neither can we keep Naval patrols constantlymoving
, .   I &quot;&apos;   ........wt-moving up and down these narrow waters.It is true that a considerable part of the European shore consists of cliffs which are inaccessible to landing parties, but the available landing places are so numerous that the provision of detachments to watch them all would adsorb several Battalions.There are also certain conditions to be considered affecting the supply and administration of our troops on the Peninsula and their general security.From this point of view the most serious objection to the proposal is that there is no harbour or port at any point along the western or northern coast of the Peninsula.    Ships carrying supplies and munitions would therefore have to anchor off the coast and land their cargoes upon the beach.    The scarcity of na&amp;ds from the northern shore to any point in the interior would add to the difficulties of supply.The possibility of having to,withdraw the garrison.in the event   of Its being ultimately attacked by greatly superior forces must not be overlooked, end this might prove a very difficult operation.Taking all the above points into consideration a military occupation confined to the Oaliipoli Peninsula must be regarded as an operation of doubtful value if the &apos; enemy is to be regarded as in any way well equipped and well commanded.If the Turkish Nationalists are to be allowed to enter Turkey in Europe unopposed, there is every reason to suppose that in time they will obtain from Russia and elsewhere all the equipment they need and which may now be lacking.The withdrawal of the Allied troops from.Constantinople
Constantinople itself and from the Asiatic shores, will have done much, to encourage them in their belief that they can attack us with reasonable hopes of success.   Consequently, as a permanent measure, the General Staff must regard the proposal to occupy  the Gallipoli Peninsula as in every way undesirable and objectionable from a military point of view.On the other hand for some months to come the . Turkish Nationalists may not be in a position to take many of the steps which have been outlined in this Peper, such as the bringing up of heavy artillery to the Asiatic shore, cr the execution of a serious attack against the Gallipoli Peninsula itself.If, therefore, for political reasons it is considered advisable to occupy the Gallipoli Peninsula as a temporary measure after the withdrawal of Allied troops from Constantinople, in order to retain for.the time being a certain measure of control over tho Dardanelles while watching the development of affairs at Constantinople, it is probable that this could be done without running any grave risks.For such a purpose, it is thought that the present garrison at Constantinople would be sufficient, provided it was strengthened by the addition of at least one Brigade of Medium Artillery.There would, be certain advantages both from the Naval and Military point of view in also.holding a position, on the Asiatic side covering CHANAK and the NARROWS, but to do this would require another Brigade of infantry and some additional artillery, and such an occupation would be,purely ,      temporary, and oould not maintain itself against serious attack,neraX Staff,War Office, S.W.1. -7-5rd June; 1981,
AIR ASSISTANCE REQUIRE!) FOR, HOLDING THE DAR1).LNIj1TiLES *Notoh prepared by the Air Staff.1* Owing to tho email number of aircraft available andthe absonae of aerodromes the part cf the Royal Air Force in this operation can only bo a purely auxiliary ouo&apos;*    Its role -would bo:-fa).   Reconnaissance of the Asiatic Coast and tho Marmora side of the Dardanelles to watch the activities of the Nation-aliet forces on tho coast and to watch for mines and possibly submarines in the Marmora entrance to the passage, lb).   Observation of fire for artillery placed on. the Gallipoli heights and firing on tho Nationalist - positions across tho Straits or for ships&quot; firoo2. Tho only aircraft available for this purpose areseaplanes.These should bo efficient for reconnaissance work but artillery observation for laud guns will suffer somewhat owing to the difficulty of maintaining olose touch with Army Artillery personnel on tho peninsula^3o It may bo necessary, depending on tho number of gunsmounted on the Gallipoli Peninsula, to so rid another squadron in ordor to carry out artillery observation.    There would be considerable difficulty in providing this squadron, as it would have to como either from ^egypt or Ireland.If. this squadron wore to remain there for .more than a month it would bo necessary to have a Depot established at Imbros with tho personnel roquirod*     This could bo done if the personnel wore token from Egypt, which- would seriously interfere with keeping up the Kiddle East, now fully occupied, 4. The prospect of offensive aerial action by Turkishand Bolshevik aircraft is not great;, but thoir presence in$ho air/-n   $  -
the air would have considerable moral effeot and they cannot be intercepted by our. seaplanes.     It Is undo sir able that they should operate unmolested and it is recommended therefore that a Flight of Fighters (Snipes) should be&apos;mads available from Egypt, if it pan be .spared.    A Flight of W0c56 Squadron has for some months been earmarked as a possible rein for cement for this theatre5. The Island of Imbros io the only available base forifooth aeroplanes and seaplanes.     It belongs to Greece, but no difficulties as to its temporary appropriation by us need be anticipated.     During the war it was used as an aircraft base and possessed two aerodromes, ono on the Western extremity of the Island, the other on tho South-Eastern:   the former is the better and should be utilised as the base aerodrome, the latter might be used as a landing ground-    Imbros possesses an excellent harbour which could bo used by tho seaplanes * 6. A landing ground can be established during the summer months at Capo Helles on the too of the Gallipoli Peninsulas This could bo utilised by tho Fighters to increase their radius of aotion..    Seaplanes operating from Imbros Harbour could patrol the Straits and the waters of tho Sea of Marmora up to the Island of Marmora.Air Staff.June 2nd 1981.- 9 -
