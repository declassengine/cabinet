This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Referred toCommittee of Home AffairsSECRET.CP. 3049.THE CABINET.DISOHAKGES FROM WOOLWICH.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.In continuation of my Memorandum of 9th April, 1921, CP. 2814, on,the question of discharging men surplus to requirements at Woolwich, I would draw the attention of my colleagues to the following : On 4th April, instructions were given by the War Office that discharges at Woolwich, which at that time were suspended, should proceed at the rate of 200 a week. Some 2,000 employees were surplus to requirements. The decision to proceed with discharges was communicated to the Members for Woolwich (Sir Kingsley Wood and Captain Gee) at an interview with the late and present Finance Members on the same day.Representations were, however, made by Sir Kingsley Wood and Captain Gee to the Prime Minister, and discharges were on 5th April suspended for one week pending further consideration.As a result of a conference of Ministers on 9th April, discharges at Woolwich were suspended indefinitely in view of the industrial situation.On 11th April, the National Federation of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers were informed that &quot; all discharges of ex-service men from departments in the Woolwich Pool have been suspended until further notice.&quot;In the meantime, the number of men available for discharge is increasing, and taking all the departments at Woolwich together, at least 3,000 could be dispensed with at once. The actual requirements, apart from other considerations, would prohtbly permit of a further 3,000 being discharged by the 1st April next.The question for decision is at what date discharges should begin, and at what rate they should proceed.The retention of every thousand men costs the State something like 5,000 . a week in direct expenditure alone.Discharges of War Department employees outside Woolwich, as also of Admiralty employees at the dockyards, have been proceeding throughout the period. I consider it essential that Woolwich should be brought into line in time to secure as large a reduction as possible before the winter.I recommend that discharges should be resumed at Woolwich as from the 1st July, and should proceed until further notice at the rate of 300 a week, taking all the departments concerned together.L. W.-E.The War Office,16th June, 1921.(B21/224)   100  fj/21   H&amp;S, Ltd  9272wo
