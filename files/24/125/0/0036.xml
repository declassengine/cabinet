INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFKRBJNOB. &apos;   b03j&apos; ;       !   WEEKLY REST DAY.   &apos; ,, /In his memorandum on this subject, 0. P. 2969, the Minister of Labour suggests that as in this country the principle of a weekly rest day is to a large extent established by custom, and as legislation on the subject &quot;would be an additional interference by the State in Industrial relations in this oountry without any demand for suoh interference from any of the parties concerned&quot;. Great Britain should not support the adoption of a Convention on the subject by the International Labour Conference, but should accept a &quot;recommendation&quot; whioh would not neoessarily imply the introduction of legislation^It is no doubt true, as pointed out by the Minister, that oustom has the advantage of being more elastic than legislation, but for Great Britain to refuse to legislate on the ground that in this oouniry oustom is sufficient for the purpose would, in my opinion, involve an attitude whioh is hardly consistent with the principles underlying Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles and would seriously injure the work of the International Labour Organization.By Artiole 427 of the Treaty     the High Contracting parties agree that &quot;there are methods and principles for regulating labour conditions which all industrial communities should endeavour to apply so far as their special circumstances will permit&quot;, that certain of these methods and principles seem Ho be of special and urgent importance&quot;, that one of these is &quot;the adoption of a weekly rest of at least twenty  our hours whioh should include Sunday whenever practicable,&quot; and that these principles and methods &quot;if adopted by the industrial communities who are members of the League and safeguarded in praotioe by an adequate system of inspection will confer lasting Wits upon the * the *orld.&quot;If Great Britain, a country in whioh legislation as to a weekly rest day will involve comparatively little interference    with existing practice, declines to legislate, other countries in which legislation will involve more extensive interference with existing customs, bannot be.expected to adopt legislation^i.One of the primary objects of.the International Labour Organisation is. to bring the more baokward countries up to the standard of the.moreiprogressive, and this object will obviously be frustrated If the-more&apos; progressive countries decline to legislate on the ground that legislation is unnecessary.I am afraid Great Britain will be in a very invidious position if it opposes a Convention whioh would have the effect of Introducing the principle of the weekly rest day into more backward countries, where the workers have not the advantage of a widely-spread custom and will derive no benefit except from a Convention involving legislation.
DUE      [$$hi !l StAJ JtAllOITAltflSLTKII may add that this question of the; weekly^e,^-, day was inoluded in the agenda for the forthcoming oonferenoe on the proposal of the British representative on the Governing Body of the International Labour Organization, as the result&apos; of a conference between the Home Office and the KiniBtry of Labour.
