[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government. ]Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1921.SECRET.THE  CABINET.THE ANGLO-JAPANESE ALLIANCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE Japanese Ambassador asked to see me a few days ago and called this morning. Apparently he had the instructions of his Government to speak to me about the renewal of the Alliance and to ascertain my view.He began by explaining that Japan was most anxious for the renewal of the Alliance, and there would be no difficulty about it being framed in a manner satisfactory to the United States. They regarded good relations with the United States as essential to their position. Nor was there any difficulty about immigration of Japanese into Anglo-Saxon communities of the Pacific. They were going to arrange this in a satisfactory manner. Nor was the &quot; vague fear&quot; that China would be offended well-founded. Mr. Simpson did not represent the views of the Chinese Government, with whom the Japanese were in close negotiation.I said, in reply, that I was a supporter of the Government which in 1902 made the original Alliance, that I had watched with breathless interest and sympathy the struggles of Japan in the war with Russia which followed, that shortly afterwards I had become a Minister, and that, therefore, during the sixteen years tliat had passed 1 had been able to see from, the inside what a very sensible and sober-minded ally the Japanese people were. I assured him that my sentiments towards Japan were those of regard and respect, based on a long experience of their attitude towards us. I said I had no doubt he knew this was also the view of the Foreign Office, to which he assented.I then asked him whether he had read the various pronouncements by the Dominion Prime Ministers, particularly Mr. Hughes&apos; important speech delivered before he left Australia. He said he had, and that it was a very good speech and he liked it very much. I told him Mr. Massey had also made a public declaration endorsing what Mr. Hughes had said, but that Canada viewed the situation, as he knew, from a somewhat different angle. The whole matter must therefore be the subject of serious discussion in the Conference about to open, and it would be no use anticipating the results of such discussions.I said the greatest danger we wanted to avoid was a naval rivalry springing up between the Pacific Powers and leading to heavy building between the United States, Japan and Great Britain. This would be a disaster of the first order to the world, and we must do everything in our power to avoid it. The Ambassador assented, saying Japan could no more afford than anyone else to go on with the building of these gigantic programmes.I said that, speaking for myself, I hoped some solution would be found in the next few years of all the outstanding questions in the Pacific, and that some great international instrument would be drawn up which would assure the peace of the Pacific and the legitimate interests of all parties there for twenty or thirty years. Such a conclusion was certainly not, in my opinion, impossible, and I did not see why the specially intimate and cordial relations between Great Britain and Japan in Asia should be any bar to this larger hope.I reminded the Ambassador again of the way in which the Japanese Navy had co-operated with us when I was First Lord in the combination which resulted in the destruction ,of Admiral von Spee.1 was careful to point out to him that, as he had begun by saying, he wished to speak to me in a private capacity, I was only speaking in the same sense, and that he [6459]
must understand that the only authoritative information he could receive on these matters would come from the Foreign Office.I endeavoured to leave on his mind the impression,that I considered our most important object was to avoid a naval rivalry between Great Britain and. the United States, but that, subject to that, I was a well-wisher of Japan.W. S. 0.Colonial Office,June 17, 1921.
