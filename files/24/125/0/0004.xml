(Communicated by tho Earl of Crawford and balcarres).Part I of the Aot guarantees minimum prices for Wheat andoats of the 1921 and subsequent crops grown in Great Britain.    Theactual prices for each crop are not specified but are to be calculated by reference to the minimum prices mentioned for &quot;thestandard year&quot; to which are to bo added^percentage increases in respectof the increased cost cf production of each crop.    The &quot;standardyear&quot; is the year 1919 and the minimum prices are for Wheat 68/- percustomary quarter of 604 ibs.., and for Oats 46/&quot; per customary quarterof 336 lbs*        On the assumption that the cost of production of the1921 crop increases these minimum prices by 17i per cent for Wheat and15 per cent for Oats, the prices to be paid will be 80/- for Wheat and53/- for Oats.-Growers will sell their Wheat and Oats at current market values and the amount payable per quarter by the Government will be the difference between the guaranteed&quot; minimum prices, ascertained as stated above, and the average of the Gazette prices (ascertained in accordance fcith the Corn Returns Act 1882) for the. seven monthsSeptember to March Inclusive.    Payment will not be made against salestoof Wheat and Oats, buy the occupier of land on which Wheat and Oats are grown in any year, and ct the rates of four quarters per acre for Wheat and five quarters per acre for Oatse    Assuming that the acreage for the 1921 crop, under Wheat and Oats Is substantially the same as for the 1920 crop, vis* 2,000,000 and 3,333,COO respectively, the friability of the Government will be in re&amp;pect cf 8,000*000 quarters of Wheat and 16,665,000 quarters of Oats.The average cf the Gazette prices from September to March in any cereal year will be in relation to the course of the Worldfs prices during that period and ao-an index figure for Wheat, the dally New York
York Spot Cash quotation for No, 2 Rod Winter may converted&amp;a&amp;ontly &quot;bo taken.    For Oats there is no foreign market in particular whioh por-manentiy affects prices in this Country c but at any time thedifferanoe between the Gasetto price for Homo Grown Oats and tho selling prioes of Canadian, American and flrgehtine Oats will indloate their relative Values.[B6AT.The New York oash prioe for Wheat last week was about $1.80.Taking exchange at $3,90 and freight at 7/-* per quarter and allowing for fobbing charges, insurance, etc., this prioe is equivalent to approximately 80/- per quarter of 480 lbs. o.i.f. Ports, and iscomparable with Home Grown Wheat at approximately 70/- per 504 lbs.&amp;t grower&apos;s station.    tt follows, therefore, that on the basis laiddown as to rate of exchange and freight, and on the assumptions as to cost of production, aoreage, eta. $he liability of the Government atthe end of May, 1921, appeared to be 10/- (i.,e. 80/- minus 70/-)per quarter on 8,000,000 quarters, or  4,000,000.    It should be noted that(with exchange at $3.90) a fluctuation of 5 cents per bushel in theNew York prioe is equivalent to 2/- per quarter, and (with Wheat atin the rate of exchange J51.S0J a fluctuation of 5 oents/r &apos; is equivalent tolid. per quarter in the o.Lf. U.IC. pride.OATSkThe last Gazette prioe for English Oats was 38/3 $er 312 lbs.equivalent to 41/2 per 336 lbs.    The present liability of the Govern-. therefore,ment would appear/to be approximately 12/- (i.e. 53/- minus 41/2) per quarter on 16,665,000 quarters or  10,000,000.It is of course impossible to forecast the trend of World prices or the rate of exchange during the period September 1921 to Maroh 1922, but the foregoing statement will enable a calculation of the potential liability of the Government to be made at any time.Although
Although it Is provable that  moderate fall in p:?ioes may be sustained throughout this period, it is unlikoly that %eat will fall to Sne dollar per bushel,    The Gazette price for JSngilsb Oato may be as low 30/- per 312 lbs.
