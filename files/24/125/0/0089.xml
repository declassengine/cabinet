(Thio Do^**nrf!nt is the Frcocrtv of607HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.IJ.&apos;55^JUHIES PROVISIONS) (REKI3WAL) BILL.MI340RA31JUK &quot;BY THE HOME SECRETARY.In 1320 attention was called to the fact that in certain Cities whioh are Counties in thonselves and have a separate Commission of Assize, it had been tho practice for many years not to prepare jury lists in accordance with the Act of 1825 but to use the iurgess Iloll as a jury list.The matter was referred to the Law Officers, who advised that the practice of using the Burgess Roll as a jury list in these Citing was illegal and that, upon tho true construction of the Act of 1325, separate jury lists should be prepared in accordance with the provisions of that Aot.It was then too late for jury lists to be prepared for the year 19R1, and. accordingly the Juries (linergenoy Provisions) Act, 1920 - copy attached -was passed, which legalised verdicts which had b-en returned by juries under the old systen and provided that for the year 1921 the Burgess Roll night be Used with a mrk plaoed against the names of those persons who, under the Act of 132% were qualified and Liable to serve.It was contemplated that in the following years the jury lists would be prepared in accordance with the Aot of 1825,    The City Authorities conoerned, however, have represented strongly that the preparation of a separate jury list for 1922 would entail heavy expenditure and a further increase in their already swollen rates,    General legislation revising the whole law relating to the preparation of jury lists is desirable and a general Bill is now being prepared.    It will not, however, be possible to carry general legislation this Session, and in thsso oircurostances I thin!&quot; that, in view of the objections raised by these City Authorities, and especially their strong objections on grounds of eoonomy, it is undesirable to compel then to adopt the procedure laid donp. by the Aot of 1:325 and that the provisions of the Aot of 1980 should therefore be extended for another year.The Cabinet are accordingly asked to approve the attached Draft of a Bill for this purpose.    It is not anticipated that the Bill will meet with any serious opposition.It is proposed that the Bill shall be introduced in the House of Lords by the Lord Chanoellor,37/o/*tt,
