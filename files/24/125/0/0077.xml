This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET. b,cp. 3075.THE CABINET.THE MILITARY SITUATION IN IRELAND.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate a memorandum by Colonel Sir Hugh Elles, K.C.M.G., C.B., D.S.O., Commandant of the Tank Corps Centre, embodying his impressions of a recent visit to Ireland.L. W.-E.The War Office,24th June, 1921.I arrived in Dublin on the morning of 13th June and left on the evening of 14th. During this time I derived impressions from the little I saw and the great deal I heard from staff and regimental officers of all grades. These impressions are so strong that I have thought it right to record them, because in a long experience of liaison work I have never before been left so bewildered. The position is Gilbertian, with the humour left out. Moreover, although I have been kept more or less in touch with the situation by reading the papers and interviewing officers who have returned, I found the real situation so much more serious that I imagine there must be very few officers, even at the War Office, who really know what the state of affairs is.The British Army in Ireland is besieged. I suggested this view to a highly placed Staff Officer. He demurred, although feebly, and suggested that there was at least a &quot; no man&apos;s land.&quot; Nevertheless, the facts are that responsible officials cannot move without strong escort; money cannot be drawn from the bank without strong escort; despatch riders are being rapidly replaced by armoured cars; officers must move not only armed and in bodies, but with their revolvers very handy; in motor cars they carry them actually in their hands. Troops sleep in defended barracks behind barbed wire.Communication by road is becoming increasingly difficult. To go from Dublin to Cork, one may fly, one may go by T.B.D. and be met by escort at the docks, or one may go very slowly by armed train. Communication is so laborious and difficult that it is not unnatural that personal liaison between Army Headquarters and the divisions is very much reduced, as also, I understand, is that between divisions and brigades, and brigades and battalions.On the other hand, the population moves when, where, and by whatever route it wishes. This is a curious situation for a force whose raison oVetre in the country is to maintain order.Anyone can enter Ireland, and enter it hung about with any number of revolvers. The search for arms at Holyhead is a farce. Minor civilian officials are everywhere, even among clerks at General Headquarters.The outlook of officers is curious. Possibly the climate has something to do with it. It is certainly not simply the usual patience of the regimental soldier. I only met one man of any optimism and that was, I think, an optimism based on his official position. Of others, a very few were pessimistic, while the bulk were just fatalists. There is no evidence of morale getting low, but I thought I detected a great listlessness amongst all except the highly placed responsible people.A great deal of distress, delay and discontent is caused by the fact that the &quot; war &quot; has to be run with the peace-time (1914) machinery of administration. The paper-work for units split up all over the country is very onerous and a great waste of effort.(B21/234)   100  6/21   H&amp;s, Ltd.  9297wo
The Sinn Fein paper &quot; Am T&apos;Oglac &quot; has an astonishingly accurate appreciation of the situation in regard to possible reinforcements and the probable duration of an autumn &quot; campaign,&quot; the whole very clearly exploited, I am told, by Erskine Childers.One thing is abundantly clear : that to proceed on the present system of impotent defensive, and without Martial Law rigorously exploited, is useless. If you pour in more troops on the present lines, you are simply throwing good money after bad. Four divisions now are besieged in driblets over, say, one-third of the country; six divisions would be besieged in exactly the same way over half the country. Michael Collins who is gradually becoming a legendary figure, as De Wet did in South Africa can go on doing this sort of thing for years, and is making big money at the game ; 90 per cent, of houses in Ireland will shelter him, either through fear or sympathy.One heard talk of drives across country especially of &quot; the mountains.&quot; To drive successfully, one must drive to something stationary that is the experience of all partisan warfare. Further, it seems that it is not the mountains that want driving, but the slums of the town.The following steps seem necessary to clear up the situation : (1;) Martial Law, and &quot;one-man control.&quot;(2.) Every civilian to have a pass, to be visdd monthly, and house to house visitors-. :   7 .il tations in towns.(3.) Blockade against entry and exit of unauthorized persons and importation of arms.(4.) Some form of blockhouse system to drive on to ; and (5.) Despatch of all available troops to Ireland.The operation should be complete within 2 years. But with anything short of these extreme measures the present situation might go on for such time that political pressure or political change will cause us to abandon the country, and we shall be beaten. ,It seems in the highest degree improbable that an autumn campaign will finish the trouble. Even if it stops it, what guarantee is there that it will not recur directly the interned are released, unless Martial Law continues and there are sufficient troops to enforce it ?I am strongly reminded of certain phases of the Third Battle of Ypres.
