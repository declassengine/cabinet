Scotland House, S.W.1.23rd June, 1921report on revolutionary or oak is at ions01- the united KINGDOM ----m**.m*----------oOo--------------(Circulated by the Home Secretary)m&amp; COAX MINERS...................................... *&amp;ge \RED TRADE UNION INTERN AT ION AI......................... &quot;   JTHE COMMUNISTS....................................... &quot; J*UNMLOBESNT ......................................... BCONVICT IONS.......................................... &quot;jjSINN PEIN IN GREAT BBITAIH........................... J-1*summary the result of the miners1 ballot has been a surprise to labour as a whole and even to the Executive.   The percentage of abstentions was high.   TLe extremists have be-in busy undermining the influence of the* local leaders.   The number of men who nave resumed work is negligible, owing largely to intimidation, but there bas* be*n disorder in the Midlands and in Scotland.There was a significant phrase in the speech of Frank Hodges, implying that the leaders would not take the responsibility of reducing their men to starvation.The pernicious -influence of the Red Tr&amp;de Union International is growing very fast.   It is particularly active among the sailors, if the supply of foreign money on which the agitators subsist could be cut off the movement would oollapse: unfortunately a number of men have been allowed to go to the Third International Congress at Moscow with passports, who will bring back a fresh supply of funds. All the disruptive elements at the moment are fed from abroad: Communists from Russia, the Sinn Peiners from America and probably from Russia as well.   Unless something is soon done to cope with this evil there will be grave results.The most dangerous agitators now abstain from making public speeches.Unemployment and distress ara increasing all over tho country.The Labour Party Conference has rejected the affiliation of the Communist Party by a majority of nearly 4,000,000: my correspon-dent is attending the conference and a summary will be given in my nest report.A series of outrages on the railways, instigated from Dublin but committed by local members of the Irish Self-Determination League, has begun and will probably be continued.   All the persons hithertoJ arrested are members of the League.   There is at present no power to declare the League to be an illegal Association.
m co/j. MigggsThe official result of the miners1 ballot announced onFriday last was:for the continuance of the stoppage .. 438,511 . Against............................... 183,827Majority.............................. 248,684Minor corrections issued subsequently snalce the? majority against acceptance somewhat larger.The voting was a great surprise to labour as a whole, and to the miners&apos; executive in particular.   The. exact cause is difficult&apos; ,to define:   the percentage of abstentions was high.    Communists I     were touring the country in motor cars advising the men to vote for rejection.    In Durham the belief was general that the reduction of wages was 9/- a day whereas it is 2/-,    In one place three 1     extremists stood at the ballot table and ostentatiously wrote dovm I     the names of all voters for acceptance.   In one case a hoy of 17 I    boasted that he had voted three times for rejection,    Thero seems I    in Durham to be a belief among the men who abstained that their I    votes would be counted as in favour of acceptance without the I    necessity of calling attention to themselves by voting.   Among I   miners too are many men making more wages on outcrop working than j   they would do underground.j        . In Lancashire and Cheshire the&apos; necessity for a National Pool I   has been so consistently preached that, though they do not under-stand what it meatisi the men seem, likely to.stand out for it until forced to return by starvation or by a majority in the other coal-fields.    In South Y,\?!es the voting&apos;appears to have been due to the advice given by the steadier -leaders, but is nevertheless surprising in view of.the fact that extremists, such as A.J. Cook, recommended acceptance.    It is possible, however, that the reported success of the IJerthyr Board of Guardians in negotiating a new loan of  40,000 affected the result.   The Board has previously arranged for loans of  40,000   and  25,000.    The cost of out-door relief, last week, was  10,243. 1. 5d. of which  2,134.11. 3d. was given in money and  8,053.15. 2d. in kind,   the figures for out-door relief for the week were.8,791 men, 10,232 women and 26,100 children, a total- of/
of 45,123 oases as compared with 3,661 for the corresponding period last year.There is evidence that the Unofficial Reform Movement played a large part at least in the Yorkshire and Durham voting.   A.V. Viilliams, the president of the Miners1 Section of the Workers1 Committee movement and a member of the British Bureau of the Red Trade Union International caused to be circulated the following document, which was accompanied by a pamphlet showing average wages for mine workers in all districts:&quot;NATIONAL V/ORiCBRS&apos; COMITTEB MOVEMENT (Miners1 Section)&quot;To Members of the Miners&apos; Section.&quot;Dear Comrades,&quot;Pleaae take full note of the following questions that were submitted by the Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain to the Mineowners and the answer/er thereto.&quot;Here you see the waiving of all principle:   tho dividing of the coalfield into 16 areas with a Fa^es Board of about 6 or 12 each side with an independent chairman.&apos; &quot;Please take full note of wa^es chart published ii Saturday^ &apos;Daily Herald1.   There you will find the minimum standard for each District.   Here you will fini on examination the factor of subsistence level being determined, not by cost of living, by agreement betwee the owners and miners.&quot;Also you will find the leading up to this betrayal by the other notes leading from March 18th.&quot;Our slogan must be REJECTION.   No tying up in 12 months1 agreement.   No District Boards.NOTES FOR PROPAGANDISTS&quot;Friday, March 18th, 1921.   Delegate Special Conference.   Mr. H. Smith (Chair).*&quot;Executive Committee of the M.F.G.B. recommends i following resolution:that we recommend the conference to secure the opinion of their respective districts by conference decision, as to whether or not they ar prepared to temporarily abandon the policy of a National Wages Board and National Pool, and empowering the National Executive to proceed with the negotiations with the view to establishing a temporary agreement on a district basis, for the- period/
period of the present abnormal state of trade and prices, and that the Executive Committee proceed to secure principles for the future guidance of districts for application in a more normal period of trade.1WW. STB/JOSH, (Northumberland) supported it.&quot;T. CAPS, M.P. (Cumberland) moved it.&quot;W. HOGG (Northumberland) seconded it.&quot;S.O. DAVIS (S. Wales) moved its rejection.&quot;VERNON BARTSHORN (s. Wales) seconded its rejection.&apos;&quot;FRANK HODGSS begged and pleaded for the conference to accept this resolution - put up one of the finest cases for capitalism, demonstrating capitalism in excelsis Said it was impossible to get any subsidy from the Government by a strike threat - urged the delegates to go back, lay quiet for two years, building up financially the organisation, then-we may be in a better position, to iight.   Urged them to accept the Coal Industry Act.&quot;This after the, 25th Miners&apos; International Congress held at Geneva, 2nd to 6th August, 1920, 7 months previously.Prank Hodges, speaking in support of Nationalisation of Mines:-&quot;We should not forget that we are a power which must not be limited by our governments, and to-day we have a splendid opportunity which may not occur again, on account of the necessity for coal and the needs of working men.&quot;&quot;There at Geneva the following Rules were drawn u?:-Article 1.   &quot;The Federation is made up of the central or national organisations of all countries or nationalities -in Europe and the United States of America, etc., - who join after having first of all agreed, to adhere to the present rules.   This adherence carries with it an1 honourable and formal agreement to accent the inter-national charter as set out below.&quot;Clause (a)   &apos;The refusal of any further concessions to private capitalism whilst waiting for nationalisation.&apos;ES5CUTIVB MSSTING.

Defeated 15 to 4.Robson;   says there&apos;s nothing in the Pool.T/hitefield:   In the position Robson occupies he ought to be ashamed, knowing full well that the National Wages Board and Pool were the economic factors which would preserve unanimity inside the Federation.Hodges:   declares that we must waive the mandate of the districts, approach the Government, and negotiate on Governmf,iit offer.   A load must be given.   Let the Executive hcve courage to give a lead now.Smith/
Smith:   We don&apos;t budge while rani: and file tells us not &quot;&quot;to budge.   I went down to my district and reported: and they were unanimous in standing firm.   We have got to do likewise.&quot;Communist propagandists armed with this literature attended meetings addressed by local officials and afterwards swung the men round to their point of view.The number of men who have resumed work is negligible owing to mass intimidation and a lingering feeling of loyalty to the Federation. There have been disorders in the Uidlands arising from attempts to prevent men resuming work or working outcrops. The police were forced to make-a baton charge near Pooley Rail Colliery.On June 18th the miners&apos; executive decided to seek a meeting with the executives of all unions &quot;affected by wage disputes, with the object of taking national action&quot;. t Trade Union leaders are at present being canvassed at Brighton in regard to the suggested general strike and a meeting has been arranged to take place in London on Saturday.There is little enthusiasm among the rank and file, but it i must be remembered that a certain percentage of trade unionists always render blind obedience to their leaders.   It is not impossible that the miners&apos; executive hopes to save its face by this manoeuvre as, in the event of their proposition for a general strike being turned down, they could order their men to return owing to labour&apos;s lack of support.The Communists., who never miss&apos; an opportunity of aggravating industrial strife, are working to extend the dispute but their influence is less than that of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; which is largelj responsible for the bitter and disturbed state of labour to-day. The South Wales members of the Communist Party Executive have sent*an appeal to the left wing members of the South Wales&apos; Miners&apos; Executive asking for a meeting &quot;to discuss the formulation of a working policy throughout the coalfields of Great Britain.&quot;They/
Tuey add:&quot;The need for co-ordinating our activities on this field must ho manifest to thoso of us who have had experience in the working-class movement, and if success is to attend the present glorious struggle of the miners, then it is very necessary for us to come together and review the whole situation up to the present, and agree on what future action is essential.&quot;I have received the report of the monthly conference ofthe Lancashire and Cheshire Miners&apos; Federation which was heldat Bolton on May 28th: from this it appears that the meeting was principally concerned with the attitude of Messrs. Aahtonand HcGuric ^o the national pool.   In a special note Mr. Ashtonsets out his position at some length and threatens resignationunless the vote of censure is rescinded this month.:   the concluding   paragraphs emphasise the influence of the extremistelement in trade unionism:&quot;There are a number of young men who have come into the movement during the past few years who have not learned their lessons in the school where pure Trades Unionism is taught.   A fair number of these young men are now attending conferences as delegates.   I am not blaming these men for carrying the vote of censure as they have not known me sufficiently long enough.   They know very little of my life&apos;s work in the labour movement, but I do blame those older men who have known me for a long time who voted for the vote of censure.    I desire to express my grateful thanks to those 76 faithful and true friends who.voted against the vote of censure.&quot;What I have stated has been in the best interest of the men whom I represent.   It is a question that has never been discussed at any of our conferences.   If a fair discussion took place it would show the differences -&apos;  of opinion and the various definitions of the peol held by the Leaders and Delegates on the Question, so much so that I think we should be prepared to drop the pool for a time.&quot;The following important   extract is taken from thecommittee minutes of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners&apos;Federation end discloses the financial status of the organisation&quot;A discussion arose as will be seen, with reference to raising a very large loan of  500,000.   The whole matter was discussed at fair length before- the Executive Committee and -Officials.   It was thought inadvisable to attempt anything of that kind.   First of all, as is known we could not pledge security for anything liko that amount. In so far as anything could be raised, it ought to be raised for tie purpose of giving such assistance possible. As was told you b;; the Treasurer, we really had expendedpractically/
!practically every asset that wo possess, avid the only tiling that remained was our officos.   Upon these offices, I unticr,T&amp;and, about 25,000 pounds has been raised, and a bond has been entered into, that the money shall be paid baok to the oar?.-1:, and every Agent and Official had attached his signature to that bond: giving as strong a pledge as possible that the money shall be paid back, and the Offices become again- tho property of the Federatl Some of the members of tho Executive Committee thought that the amount was so small, and that as the Offices wore the only property me possessed, they ought not to be mortgaged, but it was thought that such security that we possessed should be given to raise what money we could.&quot;Frank Hodges addressed the Labour Conference at Brightonon June 21st, and laid the blame of the miners&apos; stoppage atthe door of the Government.   He stated that tue miners hadreceived financial help to the extent of between  150,000 - 200,000.   The most significant passage in his speech bearsquotation:&quot;The time must come, and come soon, when that suffering end sacrifice must be brought to an end.   Human endurance can only go so far, and we are nearing the end of our powers of endurance.&quot;We who are leaders of this movement will have to take a good deal&apos; of responsibility ourselves rather than allow this huge mass of the population to go on and on until the breaking point comes end chaos and disorder .  reigns where now discipline, good-will and solidarity hold.&quot;BED TRADE UKION INTERNATIONALTom Mann and other delegates to the Red Trade UnionInternational are now on their way to Moscow for the JulyCongress.   J. T, &quot;Murphy, the founder of the movement in thiscountry, is already in Berlin, from where he has written thefollowing letter&apos;:&quot;By the time you receive this letter I hope to be in Moscow.   Everything is in order for my journey and without something over which we have no control interfere there should be no further delay in getting through.&quot;With regard to letters I have suggested in my letter to Ethel that you both address letters to me throiif the Russian Hiss ion at Roval or make arrangements with the party for then to be sent from London.    If you do the first address as follows to ne, o/o Russian Soviet Missioi Hotel Petrcgrad, Reval, Esthonia.   Write on top left hand corner &apos;Please forward to Moscow&apos; I feel sure they would send them on.,.
1tI know I shall have to continuously run risks, but the least risky plaoe for us is Russia, so once Pro through I1 m out of danger for a time, at least as soon as I get there.   I111 try to get a message through to you if possible through the Herald.   If possible I&apos;11 write immediately I arrive and within nine or ten days you should receive the letter.   I&apos;m looking forward to quite a busy time.   I near that the first congress has been postponed until June 20, that will mean delay with the. Trade Union Congress too.   I&apos;ra not sorry for, this for it will give me a much better chance to get to know all that has gone on in my absence and to see what are the full preparations for the congress.   They are going to be great days I can assure you.&quot;Eirker, wio is a member of the Executive of the Communist Party of Great Britain and who engineered the affiliation of- -the Fife, Kinross and Clackmannan Miners1 Association to theBritish Bureau of the Hod Trade Union International has beenthwarted in his attempts to send official delegates to the MoscowCongress.   He has therefore adopted the following method.&quot;The Standing Committee of the Fife Miners met on June ISth and one of our boys tried to get them to appoint delegates, but they decided to ignore the decision of the members and refused to find delegates.   Another nail in their coffin.   We have decided in face of this decision to send tlie two delegates appointed by the unofficial committee... The delegates we are sending are both members of the Fife, -liners&apos;, executive Board, their names are James Stewart and David Proudfoot.   It will &quot;be our duty now in Fife to Act to-day&apos;s decision of zne Standing Committee over-thrown by the members, and our action in sending these delegates endorsed, which will mean that tue expenses will ultimately be met by the miners1 union.&quot;Dick Beech, who&apos; is in*charge of the courier service at Bull,was on the continent last-week end returned to Hull on Jiuie 20th.He met Otto Bieger &quot;and some of the rest&quot; and &quot;they, all were.disapointod  at Sol. being droped in fact its possible.to get itstarted again,   I, will. explain when I see you&quot;.   These remarkswere addressed to the. man wao took over &quot;Solidarity?&apos; afterTanner&apos;s departure.   As will be seen from this extract Beech is-illiterate, and it is somewhat remarkable that a man of this type Should have been given a position of such importance from the communist point of view.Beech brought over a letter from Otto Bieger, from which the foil owing are extra cts&quot;Pleas/

For some time the &quot;rebel&quot; section of the Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union has worked for disruption and the vigilance committees have now become the British nuclei of the prospective International of liar in e Transport Workers.On June 11th the Midland seotion of the Red Trade Union International held a conference at the A.S.U. Institute, Birmingham.   Cardinal, a local communist, presided in the place of 3rain, the Midlands organiser, who is. in prison.   Only 9delegates/&quot;Structure&quot;The unit of organisation shall be the ship&apos;s oommittee composed of the workers in all departments: eaoh department electing its own delegates.&quot;All ships&apos; delegates along with delegates elected oeriodically from seafarers ashore to form a Port Committee.&quot;Each Port Committee to el cot 2 delegates to Channel Committee which shall he composed of representa-tives from defined groups of Port Committees.&quot;Sach Channel Committee to elect 2 delegates to National Executive which shall he composed of representa-tives of various Channel Committees.&quot;Committees to oe linked up in Ports, Channels and Nationally with all shore sections of workers in the Marine Transport Industry.&quot;Principles&quot;Direct Control and Action.&quot;Vesting of Control in hands of Rank and Pile.&quot;Organisation to follow the product not the process.Hides
delegates attended and their reports were scarcely encouragingfrom the revolutionary point of view.   Cardinal was appointed a delegate to the British Bureau and Sam JMnwaring of Neath,sub-delegate.   Some of the&quot; delegates expressed regret that themeeting of the Hed Trade Ihiion International was to be held in moscow as so many trade unionists were prejudiced against bolshevism and &quot;the very name of Moeeow puts a great numberagainst the movement&quot;. - It me stated at the meeting that%&apos;-vs.y big people&quot; in this country were financing the Bureauand that funds were also received from continental sources.3cyh statements, are substantially correct, as it is known that money passes through the hands of business men intorevolutionary channels.Mainwaring has informed Tom Mann that ne is prepared to to Moscow as Cardinal is unable to do so and adds the followingilluminating comments on the movement which are, however,probably influenced by his feeling that he has been overlookedfor a *?aid job.&quot;Ii&apos; you go and attend the conference it1 a up to you to put the Congress wise as to the way things are run here.   I. ref er--particularly to the. overlapping and waste of energy through the mixing up of the three movements -The CP.&apos;, the W.CV and B.T.U.   ItTs my conviction that th far most important of these is being neglected for the other two, and that one is our movement the R.T.U., as I&apos; bold that once we have captured the Unions for the real Intern, the other things will follow as a matter of cours T&apos;\en again you can make special mention of South Wales - - where the movement (the R.T.U.) has been absolutely neglected with the exception of what&apos;work has been done by myself in the Sfeath and Swansea areas.   There was a Pro. tern./organiser -appointedJ for the South Wales div. bu it ^as someone absolutely unfitted for the job and as fax as this area is concerned he would do more harm than good&apos; inasmuch that his record is a damn bad one and he is kno locally as one who is prepared to sell himself to the highest bidder.   Where, the. mistake has been made is that people whose record and experience in the Movement has be practically nil have been given charge of the work of which they know nothing and &quot;those of tried and long servi have been passed over.   Par more effective work and results would have been obtained had six full time organisers been put on the job and it would not have mean&apos; any more outlay&apos; than the way things have been run up to the present.&quot;Mainwaring&apos;s discontent with the revolutionary movement Inlthis/
this country is shared by Chapman, who took over the editor-Bhip of &quot;Solidarity&quot; and who has declined to become a member of the national Administrative Council of the Workers&apos; Committee Movement.   He informs the secretary that he objects to being definitely associated with a body which purports to represent the rank and file on a national basis but which is actually &quot;a self-elected body of people who possess a point of vi&amp;w confined, in the main, to themselves.&quot;TBS COgiTOSThe Communist activity during the week has been devoted to propaganda among trade unionists and the result of the miners&apos; ballot is due in part to their efforts.   The engineering industry is also receiving considerable attention and here also attempts are being made to influence the ballot.   It is reported that special leaflets are being printed by the Communist Party which are addressed to members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union and of the Workers1 Union, to agricultural workers and to other trade unionists, wbp are urged,..to down tools in support of the miners.   These leaflets.are not being sent through the post but Jr;:es Stewart, the Midland organiser, is, for instance, arranging distribution by individual communists to the workshops.The Executive of the Party has. issued another circular to branches asking for full details of members who are unemployed ,    and employed; those in the latter category are instructed to state their branch of industry, the factories and the districts in which they work,; their trade union and whether they are shop stewards or trade union officials.   The object of this enquiry is &quot;to get the full machinery of the Party right up to date.&quot;On June 11th the Lancashire Divisional Council meetingelected/
elected the following committee:Chairman:   P.V. Jeiilcin, (M&amp;nchester Central) Secretary: Stanley Crossley (Owishaw) Treasurer: Wilfred Hill (Oldham)Ifcnagement CommitteeMrs. Walker (B.

Webb of Ashton-u-Lyne and Comrade J. Braddock of Liverpool be the E.C representatives for the Lancashire Division.   It was further resolved that,(3) &quot;The two S.C. members received their instructions from the Divisional Coimcil, and shall report fully the work of the S.C.(4)   &quot;That the Divisional Council meet previous to the 5.C. meeting, and that the agenda of 3.C. meeting be sent to the Secretary of Divisional Council as well as to the National S.C. members.&quot;It was also resolved &quot;that all branches be instructed to form classes for the study of the statute and theses of the Third International.&quot;The Lancashire Divisional Council is pushing a scheme for a communist Cycle Corps &quot;to assure that the lines of communicationshall be maintained between the various Branches of the Party andthe/
- 13 -the Centre during times of emergency&quot; end to assure the effieiontdistribution of Communist literature during such a period.It is reported from the Midlands that headquarters are keeping a somewhat tighter hold on funds, and that the branches have been informed that they must be Belf-supporting.. &apos;Two-&apos; of my correspondents report a scheme which the Communist are about to launch for the formation of a &quot;Red Army&quot;. It appears that the Midland Clarion Club Rouse, which is situated in a small village named Sheldon, near Birmingham, has been chosen for a rally in July.   Two ex-army officers are said to be going to train the &quot;army&quot;,   inquiries into this matter are being made, but at present the scheme is in embryo.Yesterday the Annual Conference of the Labour Party, confirmed, by 4, 15,000 to 224,000 votes, the decision of the Executive to refuse the Communist PartyTs application for affiliation.UNEMPLOYMENT &quot;Unemployment and distress are increasing in practically every area in the country and the numbers give cause for grave concern.   In Lancashire and Cheshire alone the. total of wholly unemployed and part-time workers was 795,185 for the week ending June 10th.   In Glasgow and district the number is over 81,000 including 8,000 engineers.-   On June 24th the closing? of SingerTs works at Clydebank until.further notice owing to the coal shortage will throw 7:0^0 more out of work,   Glasgow pawnbrokers are so over-stocked with household goods that they are. refusing to accept any more. ,The contingent of, London Ua.omol.oy ed who have marched toBrighton arrived on the evening of Jane 20th.   The march passedoff without incident and the Labour Conference received adeputation yesterday.   The marchers were paid 3s. a.day.CONVICTIONS/
convictions on June 17th Thomas :?.&apos;Gregor pleaded guilty An the Glasgow Sheriff Court to a charge of acting and using- &quot;languaj likely to cause sedition and disaffection.   The case was adjourned till June 37th, hail being fixed in  75.On the same day Forbes William Robertson and Stanley Pulsford were hound over at Birmingham Police Court to be of good behaviour for 6 months: they had been charged in respect of speeches likely to cause disaffection among the civilian popuU tion.On June 31st Guy Aldred, D.

In this case the fire was extinguished. The men left behind them a tin of petrol and a chopper.There was also an attack made upon a watchman on the northern outfall sewer, near Plaistow railway station.&apos; At the Wortholt Junction station a porter ves fired upon but vas not hit.   The assailants bound and gagged him and took him to the booking-office, where they attempted to set the books on fire.   They rode away on their cycles.At Northolt, at 11.15, five masked and armed men cut the telegraph wires, fired at the signalman and at a man who came to his assistance, and set fire to the building.   At about the same hour a taxicab containing six armed men ms stopped by the polioe at Burnt Ash-lane, Bromley.   They immediately opened fire on the police.   Four escaped in the direction of Catford.   The police returned the fire, and one of the men, VTilliam Robinson, was wounded.   This man was recently acquitted on a charge of incendiarism in another part of London.   They had three pairs of wire cutters, a service revolver and a bottle containing paraffin.   All the men arrested are young Irishmen, between 17 and 28 years old.On June 19th at 12.10 a.m. a signalman of about 60 years of age sitting in his box close to *%rple in Chester at the junction of two sets of lines, was fired at through the glass panel of the door, which was previously broken, apparently by ablow/
blow from a wooden stake or truncheon, and hit by bullets Intwo places.   A man and his son from a neighbouring house, whoheard the noise of the shots, reached the signal Dox in about five minutes, but did not see the assailants.   The signalmanwas, however,   conscious and able to instruct them as to how to alter the signals for a train which was then due.   He was seriously injured and was removed to the Rospital.On June&apos;15th a meeting of the Lanarkshire Sinn Fein $xecutand of members of the Irish Republican Army was held in theHibernian Hall, Coatbridge.

IK5LAJD &apos;The visit of Their Majesties to Belfast was a magnificent success.   There were no untoward incidents.The week has been marked by fierce rioting in Belfast and by outrages throughout Ireland, including several murders. On June 12th a Protestant clergyman, Dean Finlay, was murdered at Swanlinbar, Co. Cavan, and his house was afterwards burnt.Government/
Government officials have been specially singled out for attack, and the murders of ex-Service men are increasing: one of the latter was found murdered in Dublin on June 12th and another in Kilfi&amp;re on June 13th.   Country houses have been burnt down all over the country and it is thought that these outrages have been perpetrated by Sinn Feiners in the belief that the houses might be used by the military as block houses.The Belfast boycott is still vigorously pursued and there is evidence that the Intelligence Branch of the Irish Republican Army is well informed.   A Southern merchent recently purchased goods in London and immediately afterwards received a visit from members of the I.R.A., who pointed out that he had been dealing in Belfast goods.   Actually only about  5 represented the value of the goods manufactured in Belfast.Sinn Fein leaders are greatly perturbed on account of the seizure by the American authorities of Thompson Sub-Machine Guns destined for Ireland.   They have put forward a sympathiser to claim the guns as his property, alleging that they had been stolen from him:   the purchase of these weapons must have cost Sinn Fain a considerable sum of money which oan ill be afforded.It is reported that I/tichael Collins has called for forty of his most reliable Volunteers serving in Dublin to proceed to England.   It is said that these men are destined for intelligent work, but on the other hand, Collins is known to be perfecting his machinery and to have boasted that when he acts the War Office will be in doubt as to whether England or Ireland will be most in need of troops.
