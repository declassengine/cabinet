The Communist Party is still demoralised and disorganisThe British Bureau of the Red Trade Union International has offered to pay the expenses of two delegates from the South Wales Miners1 Federation to the July Congress In MosoThe situation in Ireland is unchanged.   The present campaign is to be directed against military stores and dep6t and the families of soldiers living out of barracks, In the &apos;hope of obtaining arms.   A document was seized at Paisley, which shows that the Irish Republican Brotherhood is behind campaign of violence in Sngland.Through action taken on information received from the Irish&apos;Intelligence, 600 Thompson Sub-Machine Guns, ?/ith spar parts, have been seized in Ken York,     -
THE COAL MINERSDelegates returned to the coalfields at the end of last week and put the terms before their members. The local councils have also met, but apart from Lancashire and Cheshire have not recommended the men to reject the terms.*The ballot returns so far available show a majority against the terms, the most notable case being that of South Y/alss, where the majority for rejection exceeds two-thirds.    In Lancashire and Cheshire and in Durham a majority against the terms seems certain, but Yorkshire and Northumberland may show a majority for acceptance. The number of abstentions is extremely high, amounting in some areas to 50$.There are indications that a number of miners will resume work nest week, regardless of the result of the ballot.PR3SSBNT CAUSES AND TENDENCY OF INDUSimiAli&apos; UNREST&apos; Trado unionists are passing through a phase of discontent which is worth analysing.During the war the more important unions assumed an air of national dictatorship which was &quot;lir -some casos abused by extremist executives and has been greatly weakened by economic factors:&apos;   the result is a.....    growing feeling of-disgust among some of the mien who- &apos; ;&apos; are&quot; wondering&quot; Whether their high&apos; wages have&quot; not t( -been- too dearly bought.&quot; Unemployment, the high price of living end the incessant Press campaignI^U: 1 against foreign policy are at the same:;time givingri se/
m   2rise to serioufc and growing distrust of the Government. Many workers are saying that the Government should, refrain from accepting responsibilities in other countries and devote their energy to reconstruction at home.   There is also the old feeling that the Government is inclined, in industrial disputes, to &quot;load the dice&quot; in favour of the employers.   There is universal condemnation of the alleged discrepancy between the reductions in wages and in the cost .   of Hving and the prospect of increased rents - is adding fus to the firo, ; ,   :Last, but by no means least, the question of beer is important:, tho continuance of restrictions and the poor quality and. high price of beer irritate the workers to an extent which is little understood.On the whole, while the communist movement has been greatly, hampered by recent prosecutions,,the present tempei .   of,Labour is likely to affect the:polls.,THE COMMUNISTSThe activities of communists have been concentrated , on the.various ^ xoe Speech&quot; epmmittees:   Mr. Neil McLean, is chairman of the national committee which was recently formed ,by labour men at the House of Coimons; and the Bev. Herbert Dunnico is, secretary.  - Working. .with some astutonea the communists have contrived to-create,; the impression that Labour,, as a whole, is behind this: movement:   the method adopted, is fpr extremist councillors and trade union offid to take the initiative in the formation of &quot;representative&quot; local committees which really voice the feeling of a handft of extremists only.Actually the great mass of Labour is either indlfferen or antagonistic to the communists and has, in many cases, expressed satisfaction at their arrest.    At Doncaster lastweek/
week my correspondent sounded several groups of miners in connection with the case of Eannan:   without, exception themen replied, with varying adjectives.to the effect that&quot;These b..... bolshies are no concern of ours...we did not ask them to come...Gur officials know their &quot;business and why should we care?&quot;    It is worthy of note that althoughthousands of miners live around Pone aster, the Court was practically empty when Hamian was tried, in spite of advertisements in the local Press.On June 7th, at Newcastle, a &quot;communist named Thompson,when spoafcing of recent prosecutions, was interrupted by oneof his audience, who said, &quot;They should not be put in prison.&quot;Thompson smiled and said,&apos; &quot;I agree with you&quot;, whereupon theman said, &quot;The ....... ought to be put up against a wallin the barrack square and shot.&quot;   The conversationcontinued as follows: &apos;Thompson.       &quot;There are other people, who: ought tobe shot.&quot;.   Interrupter. . &quot;Yes, you1re one of them.   YouTre acommunionist.&quot;Thompson.       &quot;You ca^t speak English.&quot;Interrupter.   &quot;I speak Tyne-side and that&apos;s Englishenough.   I am a working man and work for all I get.   Where do you get your money?   I don1t go spouting about market places.&quot;&quot; The Vielsh communists decided discretion to be the better part of valour when the Prince of Y&apos;ales visited.Cardiff:   for weeks they had been planning a specialcampaign to be conducted by William Gee in connection :with the Prince1a visit, but hastily abandoned their plans,through fear of personal injury, when they realised theloyal feeling of the population.The South Wales Divisional Council meeting of theComunist part -y was held at Cardiff on June 11th.   About
50 delegates were present and Tom Clark represented the national executive.    The Conference appointed T.J, W?,tkia and A,3. Cook as members of tiie national executive and elected the same men as their own divisional chairman and secretary,My correspondents report that there is still evidence of demoralisation among communists in the provinces and that the movement, in comparison with April, is lifeless. Coventry communists are much depressed by the result of thf action over the I,L,I?, Booms:   the sales of the &quot;CoIamuniB1;,Iin the Coventry-IJuneaton district,amount to about 280 copies weekly;   one copy is sent each week to all trade union branches in the area,Coventry communists have recently adopted the habit o; making offensive remarks regarding the Defence Force, khalcj and medal ribbons.    On June 7th they so irritated one soldier that he took off his tunic to fight them, but they ran for shelter to the Rooms.James Stewart has been active among the miners in Mansfield since his release from prison.William McLaine&apos;s propaganda visit to Leicester has proved a complete failure from the financial and recruiting points of view.    Collections in Leicester for the whole week amounted to 18/- while at Desiord only 5/- was collected.    The Leicester branch is in a dilemma as regard the payment of McLainels expenses and McL&amp;ine wag told that he must wait until they obtained more money:   this he declined to do and said he would remain in Leicester until h$ was paid;   on Friday last, however, he was summoned to London by headquarters.    The sales of the &quot;Communist&quot; have decreased during McLaine&apos;s visit:   only 74 copies were sold last week and 70 were returned;   the order for this week
m 5 Mia only for 8 dozen and is the lowest for a long time.TEE HEP TRADE UNION INTERNATIONALA confidential report of the Sheffield conference of the Red (Trade Union International has now been obtained., from which it is clear that the number of delegates officially stated to have been present,  80, was an exaggeration:   the actual representation was as follows:-Union Delegates   Branches   Pist.

The second resolution, which was carried with three dissentients, was proposed by George Fletcher, operative bakers, and seconded by B. Worrall, Yorkshire Miners1 Association.    Fletcher was subsequently-elected a delegate to the July conference of the Moscow conference, but will not be able to attend, as he is now serving/

A collection taken1 forthe dependants of men in prison realised 33/-The fourth delegate to the Moscow Conference for whom Lismer is making arrangements is John Strain,chairman of the Clyde Joiners&apos; Strike Committee,    He hasbeen provided with a Scottish report for presentation atLCoscow from which the following are extracts:&quot;Success has not always smiled upon us but when the hurricane manner of our attack anci the cumbrous and slothful nature of Trade Union machinery is considered - through which we had to operate -then there is no cause for despondency.

SHEFFIELDFollowing a small demonstration at Sheffield on June 8th*Sheffield ToY/h Hall was besieged by the unemployed on june 13th, who protested against the proposed reductions in- the scale of-relief pay.    About 10,000 people were in the square facing the Town Hall, traffic was held up and twocars were seized by..the demonstrators..The Sheffield Guardians have about 8,000,men employed on relief work and the Ecclesall Guardians between.5,000 and 6,000:   the majority of the men struck work at noon on June 13th and held a mass meeting at which theywere urged by their leaders not, to accept the reductionsand at which a resolution demanding the immediate.resignation/
resignation of the Guardians was passed. Headed by tbeil band and their banner, which is inscribed ;&apos;Death is betti than semi-starvationthe unemployed then marched to tH Town Hall. A deputation interviewed the Lord Mayor whill speakers addressed the crowd: the &quot;Red Flag&quot; was sung.I Hy correspondent states that the communists were the driving force behind the demonstration and that there ill much wild talk among the men: they are particularly Mil against the Labour Lord Mayor and dther official labour!Attempts to demonstrate at i  otherham on the same dig were unsuccessful: about 600 people, mostly idle apecJ assembled in College Square in the morning: at 10.30 a, the Sheffield banner tos brought into the Square, the w &quot;Rotherham1 having been substituted for Sheffield. It i read &quot;Rotherham Unemployed. Death is better than semi-starvation&quot;, and bore the skull and cross bones.An attempt was made to form the procession and aboi 60 fell in.behind the banner.   TMey were.evidently not satisfied with the numbers, and one of the leaders calls them all hack to the platform.   About 300 people gathers around the platform, others standing about the street tl see what would happen.   One of the members of the        1 Coumittee addressed the crowd, telling them that the    1 Committee were out for gating them proper relief and ii. they wanted it, it was up to them to fall in behind the I banner and back up the Committee.   If they were not     I prepared to support the Committee the Committee would   i leave them to look out for themselves.   &quot;So it is up tol you to either fall in or fall out&quot; he said.    Another m spoke in a similar strain and then one of the party     If shouted, &quot;Pall in&quot;.   This time not more than 20 fell inlf and after a pause the banner was lowered.   They then majan/    i
an attempt to hold a meeting anc! tried to persuade the men to join in the procession.    After a speech they asked for a show of hands by those who were prepared to follow the banner and about a dozen voted.   Further appeals were made and on three occasions they were asked to vote but not more than 20 expressed their vrillingness to join the demonstration.    The word &quot;Rotherham&quot; was then removed from the banner which..w*s tied to a bicycle and taken back , to Sheffield.   The leaders of the movement were evidently much annoyed at the turn things had taken and openly expressed their disappointment, while the general public laughed and took the whole business good humouredly,THE) TRANSPORT WORKERS1 F35DBI&amp;EIOHIn view of the importance of the National TransportWorkers1 Federation special interest attaches to the membership and funds of the organisation.

Several 0 lodges, which had agreed to take up the scheme, are gradually dropping out and there is, on the whole, a pooj response,SIKH FEIN Hi GREAT BRITAIN.%There has been comparatively little vlnn Vein activi in this country during the week.    A series of lectures delivered in London by Prof. Stockley of Cork University, a member of &quot;Dail Eireann&quot; has been well attended, Mr. Barry Egan, the deputy lord Mayor of Cork, has also addressed meetings in London.In order to raise funds for the dependents of Irish political prisoners a fair was organised by the Roman Catholic Clergy (Sinn Pein) of Glasgow in Eenmure House Grounds, Bishopbriggs, on June 11th and 12th. About 15, attended on the first day and about 20,000 on the second, The financial result of the fair is not yet known; it if! said that large numbers of the Irish Republican Army were present.On the 4th June, two men were arrested in Paisley on a charge of conspiracy to endanger -ives and property -Edmund 0&apos;Brien and Cornelius Phipps.    They were remanded until the 15th,   The document in the appendix was found in the possession of one of them.

Tho situation in Ireland is unchanged,  Extensive plans havo been made for burning all military stores and depot8 and raids for the purpose of obtaining arms aro expected to be made upon /ulit,,ry families living out of barracks.It is reportoc&quot; the.;, members of the Irish Republican Army in certain districts have been warned to hold themselves in immediate readiness to leave home- for active s -rvioe.The morale of the Irish republican Army has been seriously affected ov the practice of raiding- trams and holding up men on point duty at the corners of streets.The &quot;am TMglac&quot; of the 3rd June has an article dealing with the Customs House and points out that a number of onemy departments which were a grer.t menace to tho &quot;Dail Local Government Department have been destroyed. Stress is laid on the fact that every part of Ireland now has &quot;Flying Columns&quot; which meet with success and the soldiers of the Republic in the much talked-of six oourty area aro showing where their allegiance lies and will teach the traitors a much needed lesson.    The paper declared that the Irish Republican Army was never stronger than to-day, the enemy1s grip&quot; of the country has been shaken and the machinery of Government smasher3 to atoms.   The Kerry Brigade is to commence serious operations at once.Shipping offices have been asked to supply lists of emigrants so that a chock may be put upon the emigration of Irishmen of military a^e-   it is reported that some person in Cool^s head office in London has agreed to supply &quot;Pail IJireann&quot; with this information but that the Liverpool branch has refused:   attempts are now being made by Sinn Feiners to place a sympathiser in the latter office.....

jRSLAMD   (Otd.)There being reason for believing that the I.R.A. were arranging for the importation of a considerable number of Thompson Sub-Machine Guns, a new and rather deadly &quot;weapon, this Directorate reported the matter confidentially to the American Embassy and entered into relations with the local agent for the gun in London, with the result that yesterday 600 of these guns were seized by the American Customs, together with 160 magazines and hundreds of machine gun parts.   They were consigned to Belfast.
APPENDIXICO ALL COUNTY CENTRESYou are to take charge of the following General Orders and have them conveyed to all circles under your control, with the least possible delay.The matters contained therein call for your own personal attention, and ycu are hereby directed to see that the activities outlined are carried out in the manner directed, under your own supervision.BY ORDER;March 1921. . v &quot;GENERAL 0HDBB3A.   organisation in reviewing the activities of the period that has elapsed since the&apos;elections were last held within tho/organisation two years ago, in tho opinion then expressed regarding the importance of&apos; maintaining&quot;the I.R.B. in a Virile and effective position throughout the country is now reiterated.   The wisdom of the course adopted in the matter of preserving the organisation should now be&quot;obvious.It was then said that organisation had been responsible for bringing about ireland strong and unconquerable position, had made all Ireland republican, and had brought the country to the thresh-hold of complete freedom.An Ireland regenerated, and overwhelmingly republican has during tho past two years battled with the enemy to maintain the Republic, the part played in the struggle by the men of the organisation has been of the most tremendous importance.That the organisation made the fighting possible and contributed largely to the splendid&apos;stand made, and being still made by the fighting men of Ireland, is unquestionable.   It is noted that areas in which most activity prevails, and in which great successes have been achieved have been those in which the members of the organisation have realised to the full the responsibilities attaching to their membership as set &quot;out in their inception oath, and also in the constitution of the organisation, and have acted up to them, not necessarily by bringing great numbers into the organisation, but rather by maintaining a state of efficiency among existing members.   In these areas the organisation fulfilled its most important function, that of inculcating the fighting idea not alone among the men of fighting age, but in addition through its other activities to band in support of the fighting men, and the fighting idea all the national bodies.In this regard the organisation serves, as it intended to serve, all the functions of a national rallying centre from&apos; which the republican idea goes forth through the Volunteers. Sinn ^ein, Public Boards, Gaelic League, G.A.A. and all parties helping %p tho cause of the Republic.   In their own sphere these activities are essential until the enemy forces have finally been withdrawn from Ireland.B   CO-ordination in the matter of co-ordinating the military work of theorganisation/
organisation with that of the Irish Volunteers, we have been very successful. In response to the orders Issued organisation men everywhere have shewn tact and wisdom in X\ matter, and to this may be attributed a good deal of the efficiency that has resulted in great military successes in the areas i/faers t,be: fi&amp;h&apos;sing has be on most intense. This is only as it should be, ana strict accordance with the desires the S.C. The military functions of both bodies are sirailai to each other, the success or failing of one, is the success or failure of both.0. MILITARY 7/0 RgAs stated above the fighting ha3 been carried on more vigorously where the organisation has been efficient.   In tj areas where the fight haa been less vigorous, or not waged al all, the organisation has been missing the importance of its! most importance function.   The Supreme Council desires to see the fight waged everywhere.   Untiring efforts In this regard will lessen the hardships of our men and the pressure! our forces.3).  -QHSAjnSIHQ work it must be obvious that in order to maintain or create efficiency organising work must not be neglected.The present strenuous position of things is often given as an excuse for not holding regular meetings of Circles or Officers1 Boards within the   I.R.3.: ,  ;Without such meetings at regular intervals the essential effectiveness cannot be achieved, and united efforts in accordance with the spirit of the Organisation may be missed special stress is now-laid&apos;on the importance of carryinl on the work of the Organisation in the prescribed manner.B. HBGSJGJ&amp;CEIn view of,the prevailing conditions, any form of negligence on the. part of the officers or men of the I.R.3. is.unpardonable, and will henceforth be dealt with severely,jIn some districts it has been noticeable, and dealing i\ it .has been the cause of groat waste, of. time and energy on til part of.- those charged with the responsibility of conducting the-Organisation, and. you are now directed to, see to. it that I such offences as negligence,, or insubordination are permittel in your area., whether on, the part of the officers, or men.Organisation, men who are unable or unwilling to act up i to the spirit contained in their inception oath should be j outside and not inside the Organisation.What is needed is a good working Circle in each Circle i District. . liven - though it be-,small it should, be remembered i small bodies well organised and under proper&apos; control are alJ more effective than large, numbers loosely held together.$.   TH5 ffLBOTIOIflS. , ; ,j5 &apos; iThe time has again come for the elections within.:the Organisation, and an opportunity is thus offered for bringUl all units together and reviewing their work and their. condiiiI
m   (5324The dates for the completion of the Elections are as f o Hows:As there will be a lot of preliminary work to be doneregarding those Elections you are directed to take up the matter with the least possible delay, end arrange for the Circles under your control to meet at once..   You .will be required to report frequently to your Divisional Officer regarding the progress of the work re generally in your County.gTHB FUTUREIt is now fully realised that Ireland can win out through physical force methods.    In the past this was only seen by the minority who formed the I.R.B.   How it is a&apos; general and well justified belief, and the final ending, in complete freedom of Ireland&apos;s struggle is now rapidly approaching.   Be the term, long or short, the spirit underlying the Organisation will triumph in the complete withdrawal of the enetny forces from Ireland;   but we must have courage, confidence and physical force to the end.   The length of* the struggle will depend entirely on how these watchwords are inoulcated among the people, and it is to the men of the Organisation that we must look not alone for their inculcation but for their maintenance however long the struggle and however great the stress.Up to the present time the support given by the whole people to the fighting forces has been very great, and their attitude to the enemy has been in accordance with the wishes of the Government of the republic.   If this support and attitude are to/maintained the members of the Organisation must work whole-hearted and vigorously in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution.At no time in the history of the country have the enemies of Ireland, been so violent In their attack on the Organisation.   Every attempt is being made to draw members from their allegiance to it.   Every vile trick of the English and their apologists here is &quot;being used against it.   Mo opportunity is lost to poison the minds of the people against it.   In such a time the 8.C, calls with confidence to all members to redouble their efforts in&apos;making the Organisation more and more potent against the foe, more and more vigorous in the service of Ireland,a.
