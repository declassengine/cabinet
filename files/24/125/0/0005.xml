Printed for the use of the Cabinet,CONFIDENTIAL.(C.)[23710/1921]Colonial Office to Foreign Office.Sir, Colonial Office, May 24, 1921.I AM directed by Mr. Secretary Churchill to transmit herewith to be laid before Earl Curzon of Kedleston copy of a letter which he has caused to be addressed to Sir Maurice Hankey on the subject of the proposed modifications in the draft Mandates for Palestine and Mesopotamia.Mr. Churchill presumes that these suggestions will be considered by the Cabinet, but, in view of the fact that the terms of the Mesopotamian Mandate are understood to have been drafted in close consultation with the French Government, he suggests for Lord Curzon&apos;s consideration that the proposed modifications should at some stage be communicated to that Government, in order to avoid the appearance of indepen-dent action on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government, which might result in opposition being offered by&apos;the French representative on the Council of the League of Nations.I am, &amp;c.J. E. SHUCKBURGH.Enclosure.Colonial Office to Sir M. Hankey.Sir, Colonial Office, May 24, 1921.I AM directed by Mr. Secretary Churchill to transmit herewith copy of tele-graphic correspondence which has passed between this Department and the High Commissioner for Palestine and Mesopotamia on the subject of proposed modifica-tions in the Palestine and Mesopotamian Mandates. Copy of the letter from the Zionist Organisation referred to in this Department telegram Np. 46 of the 29th April to Sir H. Samuel is also enclosed.2. Mr. Churchill has carefully considered the various suggestions which have been put forward from time to time for additions to and modifications in the two Mandates, and has decided to recommend to the Cabinet that when the Mandates are submitted to the Council of the League of Nations at its forthcoming session the British representative on the Council should be instructed to make the following proposals : 3. Palestine Mandate. Article 16 should be reworded as follows: &quot;The Mandatory shall be responsible for exercising such supervision over religious or eleemosynary bodies of all faiths in Palestine as may be required for the maintenance of public order and good government. Subject to such supervision.no measures shall be taken in Palestine to obstruct or interfere with the enterprise of such bodies or to discriminate against any representative or member of them on the ground of his religion or nationality.&quot;Article 17 should be reworded as follows: The Administration of Palestine may organise on a voluntary basis the forces necessary for the preservation of peace and order, and also for the defence of the country, subject, however, to the supervision of the Mandatory, but shall not use them for purposes other than those above specified, save with the consent of the Mandatory. Except for such purposes no military, naval or air forces shall be raised or maintained by the Administration of Palestine.&quot;Nothing in this article shall preclude the Administration of Palestine from contributing to the cost of the maintenance of forces maintained by the Mandatory.[6319] b
&quot;The Mandatory shall be entitled at all times to use the roads, railways and ports of Palestine for the movement of troops and the carriage of fuel and supplies.&quot;Article 18. For the sentence &quot;or in the treatment of ships or aircraft&quot; substitute : - ,&quot;Or in the treatment of merchant vessels or civil aircraft.&quot;New Article 25 to be inserted after Article 24 : &quot;In the territories lying between the Jordan and the eastern boundary of Palestine as ultimately determined the Mandatory shall be entitled to postpone or withhold application of such provisions of this Mandate as he may consider inapplicable to the existing local conditions and to make such provision for the administration of the territories as he may consider suitable to those conditions, provided no action shall be taken which is inconsistent with the provisions of Articles 15, 16 and 18.&quot;Articles 25, 26 and 27 to be renumbered Articles 26, 27 and 28. The following words to be added at the end of Article 28 (formerly Article 27), after the words &quot;during the period of the Mandate&quot; : &quot;Including the rights of public servants to pensions or gratuities.&quot;4. Mesopotamian Mandate. Article 1 to be reworded as follows : &quot;The Mandatory will frame within the shortest possible time, not exceeding three years from the date of the coming into force of this Mandate, an Organic Law for Mesopotamia which shall be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations for approval, and shall, as soon as possible, be published by it. This Organic Law shall be framed in consultation with the native authori-ties and shall take account ^of the rights, interests and wishes of all the populations inhabiting the mandated territory. It shall contain provisions designed to facilitate the progressive development of Mesopotamia as an independent State. Pending the coming into effect of the Organic Law the administration of Mesopotamia shall be conducted in accordance with the spirit of this Mandate.&quot;Article 2 to be reworded as follows: &quot;The Mandatory may maintain troops in the territories under his Mandate for the defence of these territories. Until the entry into force of the Organic Law and the re-establishment of public security he may organise and employ local forces necessary for the maintenance of order and for the defence of these territories. Such forces may only be recruited from the inhabitants of the territories under the Mandate.&quot;The said local forces shall thereafter be responsible to the local authori-ties, subject always to the control to be exercised over these forces by the Mandatory. The Mesopotamian Government shall not employ them for other than the above-mentioned purposes except with the consent of the Mandatory.&quot;Nothing in this article shall preclude the Mesopotamian Government from contributing to the cost of the maintenance of any forces maintained by the Mandatory in Mesopotamia.&quot;The Mandatory shall be entitled at all times to use the roads, railways and ports of Mesopotamia for the movement of troops and the carriage of fuel and supplies.&quot;Article 11. For the sentence &quot;or in the treatment of ships or aircraft&quot; substitute: &quot; Or in the treatment of merchant vessels or civil aircraft.&quot;New Article 16 to be inserted after Article 15 : &apos;1 Nothing in this Mandate shall prevent the Mandatory from establishing a system of local autonomy for predominantly Kurdish areas in Mesopotamia as he may consider suitable.&quot;
Articles 16 and 17 to be renumbered 17 and 18. Insert new Article 19 : &quot;In the event of the termination of the Mandate conferred upon the Mandatory by this declaration the Council of the League of Nations shall make such arrangements as may be deemed necessary for securing under the guarantee of the League that the Mesopotamian Government will fully honour the financial obligations legally incurred by the Mandatory during the period of the Mandate, including the rights of public servants to pensions or gratuities.&quot;5. I am to explain that the insertion of the additional clause now proposed for Article 1 of the Mesopotamian Mandate was suggested to Mr. Churchill by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, who was strongly of opinion that the inclusion of a provision that the Organic Law should be submitted to the Council of the League for approval would be of great value in counteracting such opposition as he anticipated might otherwise be offered to the terms of the Mandate as originally drafted.6. The rewording of Articles 17 of the Palestine Mandate and 2 of the Mesopotamian Mandate was concurred in by the Army Council in their letter of the 2nd April, 1921, addressed to this Department, of which a copy was transmitted to you by the War Office, and a further copy of which is enclosed for convenience of reference, with copy of the Colonial Office letter No. 10156 of the 4th March, to which it was a reply...7. The substitution of the words &quot;merchant vessels or civil aircraft&quot; for the words &quot;ships or aircraft&quot; in Articles 18 of the Palestine Mandate and 11 of the Mesopotamian Mandate was finally concurred in by this Department letter of the 5th April to the Foreign Office, in reply to Foreign Office letter of the 30th March, copies of which are enclosed.8. The insertion of the clauses providing for an administrative distinction to be drawn between Trans-Jordania and Kurdistan on the one hand and Palestine and Mesopotamia respectively on the other were drafted at an Inter-Departmental Conference of legal advisers called in consequence of a telegram sent by Mr. Churchill from Cairo on the 21st March, of which copy is enclosed, that relating to Kurdistan having been slightly redrafted in consequence of Sir P. Cox&apos;s telegram No. 44 of the 22nd April. Mr. Churchill fully recognises the objections to including these two Articles at this late stage, but is led to recommend it in view of the possibility of legal objections being raised by other parties in the future if the terms of the two Mandates as originally drafted were not strictly applied to the two territories in question.9. The addition to Article 27 (renumbered 28) of the Palestine Mandate and the insertion of a new Article 18 in the Mesopotamian Mandate is recommended on the advice of the High Commissioners for Palestine and Mesopotamia, who are experiencing considerable difficulties in obtaining officers for service in these two countries and the impossibility, as matters now stand, of offering them secure terms of employment.10. The rewording of Article 16 of the Palestine Mandate is recommended in order to meet the point raised by the Zionist Organisation in paragraph 4 of the memorandum enclosed in their letter to Sir Herbert Samuel of the 7th March, in which they objected to the use of the word &quot;missionary.&quot; Mr. Churchill supports their objections to the use of this word, though he does not recommend that any of the other suggestions of the Organisation should be adopted.11. Mr. Churchill understands from private conversation with the Secretary-General of the League of Nations that the insertion of these provisions is unlikely to cause any difficulties when the Mandates come up for discussion.A copy of this letter has been sent to the Foreign Office with a covering letter, of which a copy is enclosed. Mr. Churchill presumes that you will decide in direct communication with the Foreign Office at what stage, if at all, the proposed modifications in the Mesopotamian Mandate should be discussed with the French Government.I am, &amp;c.J. E. SHUCKBURGH.
