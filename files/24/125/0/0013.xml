(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNTffilTO). SECRET.CoP,,3013. CABINET.THE EMPLOYMENT OP SEVERELY DISABLED EX.-SERVICEMEN.Memorandum by the Chancellor of th^Ezchoquer. (Reference Memo by the Minister of Labour - C.P*2972).The Committee appointed by the Minister of Labour recommends the provision of local workshops to be managed by local Committees whioh will be  responsible for finance with the aid of a Government grant of  25 per annum for eacVs man employed.    The Committee estimate the total number of men to be dealt with as at most 20,000 to 25,000* adding that this maximum would not be reached for some considerable time.    The expenditure contemplated under these proposals is therefore  500,000 to  650,000 per annum.There is however.an inportant passage In their Report, p.22, whi-uh runs &quot;The initial capital expense would thus fall on the looality and in poorer localities it might be desirable to allow a portion of this annual amount, calculated so as to spread over twenty years, to be capitalised so as to help with the initial costs of building etc&quot;.    The oost of providing the existing Government Instructional Factories for training disabled men has averaged  100 a place for building and equipment.    To provide workshops for the men now in question would on this basis cost a capital sum of  2,000,000 to  2,500,000 and Government assistance may be needed on a fairly wide scale.    It would therefore eeem dangerous to assume that the charge on the Exchequer would be low at first and rise slowly tc; a maximumjon the contrary it would probably be specially heavy in the early years.The Report makes no difference to any training of the men who enter the factories.    I  such training were needed and the demand for it seems not unlikely, a further heavy
Initial expense would be entailed.    As a guide to the amount Involved it may be observed that it costs the Ministry of Labour on the average not less than  60 to give a disabled man six months1 training, exclusive of the cost of buildings and of any allowance paid to the man.While the Committee have examined various altema-tives with great thoroughness I doubt whether the solution they recommend would in practice work out in the manner inten^ ded*    The idea of enlisting local enthusiasm in the task is an attractive one but success is far from sure.    It may be recalled that early in the war a similar plan was adopted for dealing with &quot;hard cases&quot; which could not well be brought within the scope of the State system of war pensions.    The locality was to collect subscriptions from the public and make itself responsible for finance.    Although the necessary statutory powers were obtained, the breakdown was immediate and complete.    The poorer localities could not raise money; the richer localities, including the great municipalities, even when they had large funds already collected, refused to accept a charge which they claimed should he national and not locals    The scheme as devised did not function and the T&amp;iole of this expenditure is now administered by the Special Grants Committee of the Ministry of Pensions and the cost oharged direct to Votes of Parliament,Should the present scheme be adopted and meet a similar fate, the men will undoubtedly look to the Government to see the thing through, for their classification as &quot;Ctt men will have tended to destroy their initiative towards seeding work for themselves and, as it will appear to them, will have given them a prescriptive right to have remunerative work provided for them.    The cost, if local effort fails, can scarcely be leas t/han  100 a man or  2,000,000 to  2,500,000 a year.    The Lord Roberts- Memorial Workshops seem to have recorded a l^oss of  100 a man and though thay are said to be run/
run on expensive lines I doubt whether the Government would do better, considering the many advantages that a voluntary concern has over a Government Department in such matters as the fixing of wages, the disposal of produce etc.While therefore the Committee contemplate an expenditure of  800,000 or  625,000 there appears to be serious danger that,, if the scheme were launched and failed to secure financial support from the public, the Government would find itself unable to withdraw and committed to an annual expenditure several tlines the figures named.The men for whom provision is proposed to be made fall, as the Committee point out, Into two main classes, (i)-    cases of high disability from a pensions point of view e.g.whose who have suffered severe mutilation or loss of limbs or have been badly maimed from gunshot wounds * These are usually classified as being from 50$ to 90$ or even 100$ disabled. ( ii)    chronic cases of bronchitis, rheumatism, fits, neurasthenia, shell shock or general or physical debility.   From a pension point of view such men are generally classified at a low percentage * 20$ or 50$.    The Committee obsearve &quot;It must be borne in mind that many o  such men were probably before the war of somewhat low menial or physical type, and even had they not served, their health would probably never have been good and their prospects of employment would have been uncertain&quot;.It cannot be said that either class has been dealt with in any niggardly spirit.    Our pension system is equal to any in the world and is specially generous In giving pension, on the basis of full medical assessment of present disability, to men who suffered from some disability before joining up, so long as any aggravation due to war service remains.Apart from pensions, free treatment and other advantages given by the Pension v/arrant, all these men - with the exception of the few incapable of any work who ex-hypothesi-get 100$pension/
pension and would not be benefited by state workshops ** have received out of work donation for long periods and are covered by the Unemployment Insurance Act down to July 1922, being exempted from the special test3 as to employment in 1&amp;20 which are applied to. civilians and other ex-service men.It should be observed that so far as the grievance of thtise men is that they cannot find employment, their caso is not different at the present time from that of an unprecedented number of other men and women, who do not draw pensions from the State.I have set out above ny criticisms of the particular scheme now proponed.    I must add that in my opinion the state of national finance makes it impossible to contemplate any further increase - of expenditure on even so meritorious an object.    I need hot repeat here what.has already been said upon many occasions about our inability to find money at present-for schemes that may be desirable in themselves. Much as everybody!s sympathies must be aroused for the severely disabled ex-service men, I could not justify asking the taxpayer under present conditions to shoulder the additional burden which this scheme would impose.(Intlldij   R*S.H.Treasury, S.VJ.,June 3rd, 1921.
