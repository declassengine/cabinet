PART   II. 4. 310GENER AL   INTELLIGgNOjj.PALESTINE.The situation in Palestine is reported to he outwardly calm, but it is considered that trouble is liable to brekk out everywhere at the slightest excuse.   Unfortunately, since the Jaffa riots, which were not In themselves very serious, villages have taken up the old blood-feud between Arab and Jew and all the work of the past year is wastod.   The trouble was started by young Bolshevik Jews, who have been entering1 the country under the Zionist scheme and who are up against the Palestinian Jews as much as the Moslems.MESOPOTAMIA.A special congress is about to assemble in Mesopotamia to enable representatives of the people to decide wtaat f cam of Government will best suit the needs of the country.The British Government have lnfor med the adherents of Emir Peisal, that if he is chosen as ruler of Iraq they will give him their support and place no obstacles in his way.The Emir Felsal has decided tofeo to Mesopotamia and left Jeddah on 15th June.AZERBAIJAN.Latest renorte indicate no improvement in the economic situation at Baku,   Considerable discontent runtimes, ea-specially in the oil field area.   The principal oil export is to the North,, Batoum and Novorosslsk.   The oil wells ere guarded by troops.   Anti-Bolshevik risings are reported in the North Caucasus but Bolshevik Authorities have this area well in hand.FRANCE.The Ex-German Zepplin &quot;NORDSTERN&quot; arrived at Saint-Cyr aerodrome on 13th June.   She will probably be ueec$or the projected air route fr6m Marseille to Algiers.SYRIA AND CILICIA.The situation on the Cilician front remains quiet, although both French end Kemalist troops are busy consolidating their fronts against the outbreak of fresh hostilities.   General Gouraud has requested that there may be no diminution of re-Inforcements for the French Army in the Levant.   Forces under General Goubeau are making a &quot;drive&quot; in the Aleppo district with the object of dispersing hostile Bedouin concentrations. Kemalist recruiting is increasing In activity along the Euphrates.
The International Conference of has chosen BRATISLAVA (Pressburg^ as five years after the ratification ofITALY.The Italian Press is urging the formation of a Shipping ,Board to reorganise the Italian Merchant Marine, on the &apos;same lines as the one recently instituted in America under the Presidency of Admiral Benson.   It is considered that the present Ministry of Mercantile Marine is not run on suffi-ciently business-like lines, and that a great deal of public money is being wasted.   Under, these conditions the inauguration of a &quot;Shipping Board&quot; composed of business men and technical advisers would be of the greatest help in developing Italian oversea trade,Tlie second Zeppelin handed over by Germany to bhe Italians and named &quot;Auzonia&quot; broke away from Its moorings at Ciampino on 9th June In a strong wind, and has-been damaged to such an extent that It may be impossible to repair her.     The third zeppelin fBodensee&quot;) to be handed over is expected to arrive in a few days time.ARMENIA.- It is reported that the Bolsheviks, infuriated by the opposition of the Dashnak forces, have instituted a regime of the utmost severity.Famine Is raging in Armenia at present, and the Bolsheviks are requisitioning the very meagre grain supplies from the peasantry, and giving them to the troops.It Is believed that the Bolsheviks are endeavouring to negotiate for the surrender of the Zangezur district.TURKEY.General Nairne estimates the total Greek strength in Asia Minor at 169,000.   Adding 11,000 for the 12th Division, and 20,000 for the 1912 class still to come from Greece, the total, when the operations commence, will be 200,000.   Arms are well kept and animals generally are in good condition. Aviation is not good, and communlcations leave something to be desired.General Nairne does not agree with the pessimistic statements of the French military mission at Athens.   He considers the Greek Army a more efficient fighting machine than he has ever seen it.   The morale and discipline of the troops he has seen are excellent, and the Army as a whole has benefited by the changers in command duringthe past 8&quot; months, and, on the whole, C^n/eral Nairne considers the command, the staff and the Army oonaiderably Improved,the Danube (C.I.D) its Headquarters for the convention.The French .,..
The French battalion at Zuxiguldak is.to be withdrawn, a small detachment cn3y Is ing left under an officer tho will be instructed to   watch over the interests and safety of the British subjects there, which will be endangered by this step.
