The Oivil Servioe Arbitration Board was appointed in pursuance of the deoisien of the War Cabinet, Minute 1Z of  1 December 191$ &quot;to deal by way of conciliation arbitration with questions arising with regard to claims for increased reraoneratlon (whether permanent or temporary owing to war ooriditienc) made by olasees of employees in Government Departments, other than classes of employees who are engaged wholly or mainly by way of manual labour of a kind common te Government and other employment and in respeot of whom the Board are satisfied, on the certificate of the Government Department oonoemed, that adequate means for the settlement of such questions have already been provided pr that changes of remuneration always follow the decision of the recognised machinery applicable to the district generally.Provided that for the present and until experience has been gained of the working of the sfchomo, the Board shall not entertain applications for permanent Increase! of salary from the more highly paid classes of employees of any Government Department, namely, classes of officers with salaries of  500 or overt or placed on scales of salary rising to  500 a year or over*&quot;It is open to either party to a dispute to go to the Arbitration Board independently of the consent of the other, i,e* arbitration Is compulsory*The Board was set up in February 1917*   It appears to have been the original intention of the Cabinet to adopt the machinery of arbitration as a war-time expedient, but inthe
the Cabinet Minute of 21st December 1916 whioh ap proved the terms of reference of the itoard no allusion is made to any suoh limitation and tlie koard has come to be regarded as a permanent body.   The Government has given it a general undertaking to defend in Parliament as oeoasion arises whatever awards the Board may tssde.2.    The reasons for1 the original appointment of the Board appear to be threenfold(1)  Arbitration was1 demanded on a refusal of thePostmaster-General in 1915-16 to oonoede a general war bonus increase to Post Office employees, and arbitration was at this time more or less in vogue.(Z)   The new expedient seemed to provide a means of escape from the practice of setting up,,select Committees for the settlement of the conditions &apos;qf employment of Civil servants.(3)   It was assumed ihat existing arrangements for the settlement of wages claims gave Civil Servants inadequate opportunity of submitting their case to the authorities,3,     The case of Government employees was always clearly different from that of employees in industry who are engaged by employers working for private profit, and at any time it might have been regarded, as, unconstitutional to transfer the power of authorising expenditure from the Chancellor *of the Kxohequer to a body responsible to no one but itself.       The1 only precedent for suoh transfer of financial power before this was tt Authorities who were definitely limited by a fund of money plaoed. at their, disposal..  But these (constitu-tiohal) objections are very; much reinfoare^d by others at the present time when the need for economy, is. so urgent.   TheChancellor
Chancellor of the Exchequer is plaoed in an impossible position if he loses control over expenditure on salaries.4.       Further, the main justification for setting up the Arbitration Board has disappeared with the institution of Whitley Councils in the Civil Service.    The essence of WJiitleyiam is that it provides for free and frank discussion between the official and staff sides of the Civil Service and now that it has become the established practice in the Civil Service to consider questions of remuneration on Whitley Councils, the need for arbitration machinery no longer exists. Not only this, but the full operation of the Whitley Councils in matters of remuneration is impracticable when coupled with the existence of compulsory arbitration and the Arbitration Board.    It is impossible to secure that discussion on flhitley Councils is without prejudice to the course of arbitration, seeing that the Arbitration Board would not normally be able to award less than the official side is prepared to offer, and that therefore the staff side stand to lose nothing by proceeding to arbitration.    The following extract from a Service Journal is illuminating;-&quot;The terms of the prospective arbitrament cannot be forecasted neither can they- be expected yet for several weeks.    The Arbitration Board will have placed before them the -official offer, wMcm necessarily includes the original proposals and ,i subsequent advances, and the - staff s demands.    It ..v-is a logical conclusion that -the award givettWist lie somewhere within those limits.    More-thaft What is demanded is of Course not for a moment expected, and less than what has been offered would be manifestly uftjust.    It&apos; fallows then that under all reasonableanticipations
anticipations the Service cannot be adversely affected by the decision to submit the matter to arbitration, and in any case a really unsatisfactory award will not tie the hands of the Federation to the same extent asw onId a disappointing Whitley agreement arrived at and ratified by the&apos;Federations representatives.&quot;It will thus be seen that the existence of the Arbitration Board behind the Whitley Councils enables the staff sides of those Councils to evade their full responsibilities and at the same time prevents the official side from showing their full hand at the Councils.5.    Having regard to the above considerations, the following proposals ere made:-  ,.(a) That the arbitration Board, and with it compulsory arbitration, should be abolished:(b) that provision should be made for a-rbitration between agreed arbitrators, with the consent of both parties:. .(c) that Members of Parliament should be added to the official side of the National Whitley Council.     hese members should definitely accept the position of forming part of the official side, and would be responsible to Ministers and notto the House of Commons,It is felt that the above proposals (b) and (c) (which to some extent provide a substitute for the present Arbitration Board) are necessary in view of the facts that the Government presses arbitration on private employers;   thatthere
there Is strong feeling in the House of Commons about Civil Service salaries;   and that the addition of members of Parliament to the Council could quite fairly be presented to the staff side as a means to secure impart i-ality in the deliberations of the Council.(Intld)    R.S.H.Treasury, S.W.June, 1921.
