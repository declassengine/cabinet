ment is tne Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the use of the Cabinet.SECRET.PALESTINE AND MESOPOTAMIA MANDATES.        M(Circulated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.)Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissioners for Mesopotamia and Palestine.(No. 129.   Clear the Line   Personal and Secret.)From latest information to hand it is evident that there is serious risk that at meeting of Council of League on 17th June we shall be outvoted, as, owing to their reluctance to disregard American objections, majority of Council are expected to refuse to consider A and B mandates. Prior to the meeting every effort will be made to prevent this unforeseen eventuality by diplomatic means, but if these endeavours do not succeed we shall be faced with prospect of indefinite postpone-ment of whole question of mandates. Cabinet will consider matter almost immediately, and I am anxious to be in a position to place before my colleagues your considered opinion on the effect which such postponement would produce locally, whether as result of our agreeing not to press for early approval, or alternatively of our raising the question at the Council and receiving direct rebuff, also on the measures which you would recommend in order to meet new situation thus created. Your reply should be : Clear the Line.   Addressed Baghdad 129 and Jerusalem 115.Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Mesopotamia to theSecretary of State for the Colonies.(No. 156.   Private and Secret.) *Your telegram of 1st June, No. 129.   From my own telegram No. 129 of, 24th &quot;May you will realise that your news is no great surprise to me.   Indeed, it is because fear of some such contingency has been at the back of my mind that I have avoided any reference to mandate question since I returned from Conference.My personal belief (for what it is worth) is that if we cannot get mandate through now we shall never get it through in its present form. In fact, we are already committed vis-a-vis Feisal to an additional clause if necessary, and were he to become King I feel pretty sure the extremist elements, with example of Egypt before them, would at once work on him to press for its further modification.Mandate has never been publicly or officially discussed as far as public here is concerned, and if subject continues to be ignored as it has been hitherto, as far as I can see there will be no appreciable or prejudicial effect on situation. On the other hand, our position and policy here will be very greatly prejudiced if discussion of it is started, now, and if, in debating draft before League of Nations, we get a rebuff over it.In pursuance of above beliefs, suggestion which I am about to make must be regarded as being prompted solely by outlook within my actual horizon and by considerations affecting our present and future relations with the [ ? people] of this country. I am not able accurately to gauge bearing which its adoption may have upon question of our oil interests in Mesopotamia or other particular interests of His Majesty&apos;s Government or upon question of Palestine and Syria mandates.I would suggest that our best course is to make capital out of situation and take wind out of sails of our [ ? opponents] in League of Nations by pursuing following course.   (Begins): You would at once make an opportunity for a public(Sent 9-45 p.m., June 1, 1921.)(Received Colonial Office, 8-20 a.m., June 4,1921.)[6402]B
announcement, in which you would explain that&apos;your discussions at Cairo Conference and reports since received from High Commissioner Mesopotamia show that process of evolution towards national Government is proceeding so much more expeditiously than had been formerly anticipated, that certain provisions of draft mandate framed under conditions which existed a year ago were getting out of date, and that, in view of fact that there was reason to hope that in accordance with aspirations of people a permanent national Government would have been established at a very early date, His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided to defer further consideration of terms of mandate until new ruler had been installed and could be consulted as to precise form of compact between two countries which would best serve mutual interests of both. (It is for His Majesty&apos;s Government to consider whether or not you could advisedly add: &quot; That it seemed quite possible that in the end most satisfactory solution might lie in conversion of mandate into [one group] of treaty.&quot;) (Ends.)If made public now a decision on above lines would enormously strengthen bonds between moderate nationalists and Sherifian parties here and ourselves, and -would be a great antidote to renewed pro-Turk propaganda which is now on increase. Should foregoing suggestion be primd facie accepted it would be very timely if you could add, when making your announcement (Begins): &quot; That present indications seem to make it fairly certain that majority of public opinion in Iraq declare in favour of one of sons of Sherif; that among those sons Sherif Feisal, with his father&apos;s consent, had responded to call from Iraq, and that you took opportunity of saying should he make good he will have support of His Majesty&apos;s Government.  (Ends.) In any case, something on these lines is now urgently needed in view of further delay of your general announcement, and I would ask you to consider whether it may not be advisable to delay Feisal&apos;s departure until you have been able to clear atmosphere somewhat. It would be highly inconvenient for him to arrive at a moment when question of mandate, and consequently our whole policy and position in Iraq, was under challenge. Repeat to Jerusalem if you think fit. Cox.Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated June 4.(Received Colonial Office 10-10 p.m., June 4, 1921.)(Clear the Line.  Secret.) Your telegram No. 115.1. Postponement of mandate would weaken authority of the administration, and would be direct encouragement to foreign propaganda and local agitation. Further, since it would also prevent provision of capital by loan and execution of public works programme, it would have a further harmful political reaction.2. The only mitigation would be that if mandate were enacted in present form without consultation or agreement with Moslem Christian delegations and unless provisions of instrument referred to in. your telegram No. 122 were published simultaneously and satisfied them consequence might be a widespread outbreak here.3. If mandate cannot be carried, it would be better not to press it than to have it formally rejected or postponed. Latter would be regarded here as reopening whole question of future of Palestine and would have worst effect. It would be the least damaging course if postponement could be attributed to delay in. ratification of the treaty owing to Turkish discussion.4. Situation arising might be partially met by Anglo-French declaration based on San Remo decisions that present position cannot continue indefinitely, and that Governments will put into effect de facto the provisions of the treaty. This should be followed immediately by issue of instrument referred to. In view of the attitude that might then be taken by America and other Powers I cannot judge, however, whether such a course is practicable.Addressed Secretary of State for the Colonies 205, repeated Baghdad 390 .C.-Samuel. -
/\Note on Palestine and Mesopotamian Mandates.1. It is idle to consider what steps should now be taken to meet the situation caused by the refusal of certain members of the Council of the League of Nations to consider the mandates until we have made up our minds whether we wish to retain the mandates; to what extent international and local opposition should be taken into consideration; what measures would reduce both international and local opposition to a minimum; and whether we can afford to take these steps.   .2. Apart from the possible loss of prestige involved in giving up at this stage the mandates as at present drafted, it is difficult to see what other disadvantage would result from this policy. His Majesty&apos;s Government have spent over one hundred million pounds in Palestine and Mesopotamia since the armistice. The combined efforts of the Cairo Conference to arrive at a reduction of expenditure resulted in proposals which leave the amount to be spent this year at almost exactly the same figure which was voted before the Conference. There is little prospect of His Majesty&apos;s Government being able to avoid an expenditure of approximately nine millions a year on these two countries for the next three or four years. There is little prospect of their being able to guarantee that these two countries will cost the British taxpayer nothing for at least the next fifteen years. And there is no prospect whatever of the British taxpayer being repaid the large sums spent since the armistice within the next thirty or forty years. The retention of these two countries under British responsibility involves the extension of the land frontiers of the British Empire by over eight hundred miles. The mandates as at present drafted entrust to the mandatory the control of foreign relations and thus lay upon him the obligation for external defence. Financial considerations alone make it exceedingly difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to guarantee the defence of Mesopotamia against the Turks. Even if an agreement were arrived at by which the threat of Turkish aggression were temporarily removed, this would not alter the fact that in the last resort it would be incumbent upon the mandatory to defend the country against Turkish attack. In Palestine the mandate as at present drafted commits the mandatory to following a policy which is unpopular with the people of the country and is also a potential source of friction with the French in Syria. The Cabinet have already approved an assurance being given to the Emir Feisal that in his first public statement in Mesopotamia he will be allowed to say that His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed that, after ratification of the Organic Law, modifications in the mandate may be made by negotiation between the duly constituted Government of Mesopotamia and His Majesty&apos;s Government. The High Commissioner for Palestine has recommended at the eleventh hour that Article 4 of the Palestine mandate, which provides for the Zionist Organisation being recognised as an advisory body to the Administration, should be watered down or sterilised by the insertion of a similar article providing for the recognition of a non-Zionist body. In other words, it is almost universally recognised that the mandates cannot be maintained in their present form.It does not follow from this that there is no form in which the mandates would be of advantage to His Majesty&apos;s Government. However undesirable and expensive it may be for British control to be exercised over any of the Arab areas, it would be still more undesirable and possibly, in the long run, still more expensive if they parsed under the control of any other European Power. The problem with which we are now confronted is to frame a clear picture in our minds of the exact relations which we wish to see established between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the countries concerned; to form some estimate of the obligations which would be incurred bv the establishment of such relations; and, lastly, to decide whether it is better and easier to work for the desired state of affairs by accepting and modifying the existing; draft mandates or by publicly confessing that they are insecurely based and rebuilding them on a firmer foundation.What, then, should be the future relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and Mesopotamia and Palestine?3. In the case of Mesopotamia the answer to this question is not so difficult to find. The final relation between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Mesopo-mesopotamian Government should be a Treaty relation, under which His Majesty&apos;s Government undertakes to advise and assist the local Government to the extent desired by the latter, provided that their terms for offering this assistance and advice are accepted. It was suggested at Cairo that in order to avoid an unlimited responsibility for defence His Majesty&apos;s Government should to some extent relax[6402] &apos; B 2
their control over foreign relations, and it should not be beyond human power to devise a relation which will fulfil these conditions.The case of Palestine is altogether different. Mr. Balfour wrote to Lord Rothschild on the 2nd November, 1917, that &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a National Home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.&quot;Article 95 of the Treaty of Sevres provides that the mandatory for Palestine will be responsible for patting this declaration into effect, and this provision is quoted in the preamble of the present draft of the mandate for Palestine. There is reason to fear that it would at the present stage be impossible to obtain the consent of a representative Government in Palestine or of any body fairly repre-sentative of the country as a whole to those terms of the Palestine mandate which deal with the National Home for the Jewish people. Whether this difficulty could be overcome depends to a great extent on the attitude taken up by the French in Syria. If there were only one mandatory for all the Arab countries, and if that mandatory were prepared to draft his mandate in consultation with the local authorities and to recognise that he was only the mandatory by virtue of the consent of the people, there is no reason to suppose that it would be impossible for the Jewish National Home to be set up in the comparatively small area west of the Jordan known as Palestine. But there is not only one mandatory. There are two mandatories, and the area entrusted to the British mandate is not an area in which it would be easy to obtain a unanimous expression of opinion favourable to the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine. It is questionable whether one mandatory for an undivided Syria and Palestine could so have met Arab aspirations in Syria and Trans-Jordania that the Arabs would have been reconciled to the Zionist policy in Palestine. It is still more difficult for the mandatory for Mesopotamia and Palestine to achieve this object, since Mesopotamia and Palestine are separated by large tracts of desert and have piactically nothing in common.4. If the position bias been correctly stated above, it appears that the chief objections to the final acceptance of the mandates in their present form is the fact that they would not be accepted as a final settlement by any representative authorities in the countries concerned. It is true that Feisal has agreed to accept the Mesopotamian mandate provisionally; but he has only done so on the distinct understanding that it is liable to revision as soon as the Organic Law for Mesopotamia becomes operative. In other words, we have to reckon with local opposition to both mandates. At the same time, we have no real reason to think that local opposition in Mesopotamia or Palestine is due to the fact that the mandates have been allocated to Great Britain. It is to the terms of the mandates and not to their allocation that the peoples of these countries are likely to object. But from the international point of view we have also to meet American and Italian objections to the allocation of the mandates. These objections are apparently so strong that they will prevent the Council of the League from fulfilling its proper function of defining the terms of the mandates. Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations provides that &quot; the degree of authority, control or administration to be exercised by the mandatory shall, if not precisely agreed upon by the members of the League, be expressly defined in each case by the Council.&quot; No mention is made in the Covenant of the League of Nations of the method by which the mandate shall be allocated. The only provision which touches even indirectly upon the selection of the mandatory is the paragraph in Article 22, which provides that &quot; the wishes of these communities must be the principal consideration in the selection of the mandatory.&quot; There is no provision which makes it incumbent upon the League to accept or reject the mandatories selected by the Principal Allied Powers, the Principal Allied and Associated Powers, or whatever collection of Powers may agree upon the allocation of the mandates. Their functions are confined solely to defining explicitly &quot; the degree of authority, control or administration &quot; &apos;to be exercised by some mandatory or mandatories unknown. Criticism of the allocation of the mandates is therefore not within their competence. But so long-as, in consequence of such criticism, a majority of the Council are precluded from defining the terms of the mandates, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to get our position legalised. Whether any Power signatory of the Covenant has a right to object to the allocation of the mandates on any ground other than that the wishes of the communities
concerned have not been sufficiently considered is another question. It might well be argued that provided the prospective mandatories were in a position to give a definite and convincing guarantee that their advice and assistance was really required, all other objections from an international point of view could be disregarded.5. In order to obtain such a convincing guarantee three alternative courses suggest themselves: (a.) For His Majesty&apos;s Government to obtain the consent of the French Govern-ment to a concerted pronouncement that they wish to be satisfied that the provision in Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations which stipulates that the wishes of the communities must be the principal consideration in the selection of the mandatory has been duly fulfilled: that they recognise that until a representative body or bodies have been set up it is impossible to obtain this assurance : that the mandates, as at present drafted, are merely instruments to enable the British and French Governments to obtain a representative expression of opinion irom the communities concerned: and that, in the event, of these communities objecting either to the mandatory principle or to the allocation of the mandates, their wishes will be acceded&apos;to.(b.) For His Majesty&apos;s Government to make a pronouncement on these lines for the areas entrusted to them by the Principal Allied Powers.(c.) For His Majesty&apos;s Government to make a pronouncement on these lines for Mesopotamia and for Trans-Jordania, making a reservation in the case of Palestine to the effect that their prior declaration on the subject of the Jewish National Home carries as much weight with them as the provision referred to in Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.6. If it is decided that neither of these three alternative courses can be adopted, we are faced with the necessity for deciding whether it is possible or desirable to allow the whole question to be indefinitely suspended or whether it is necessary to insist that the Council of the League should proceed without delay.to the definition of the mandates. The Department feel strongly that if it is decided to insist upon the immediate definition of the terms of the mandates, it is none the less essential that some simultaneous pronouncement should be made to the effect that in the case of both Palestine and Mesopotamia the mandates as they stand are not final documents, but are merely instruments to enable the British Government to set up machinery in the countries concerned for the expression of representative opinion on the &quot;relations between the mandatory and the respective communities. They feel also that if it is decided to postpone consideration of the mandates it is equally necessary that the initiative should appear to come from His Majesty&apos;s Government and that it should be explained as being due to a desire to consult the wishes of the inhabitants of Palestine and Mesopotamia. Unless this were done postponement would result in weakening the authority of the British administration in Palestine, and would make the position vis-a-vis Feisal and Mesopotamia exceedingly difficult. Arrangements have been made for Feisal to leave Jeddah on the 15th June, and as Sir Percy Cox points out, it would be highly inconvenient for him to arrive in Mesopotamia at a moment when the question of the mandate, and consequently of our whole policy and position in Mesopotamia, appear to be under challenge. The Department are of opinion that there is no alternative between immediate legalisa-tion of the position of the mandatory, accompanied by a declaration that the mandate will be modified in such a way as the mandatory may consider desirable in consul-tation with the local authorities; and abandonment of the mandates as at present drafted, either by the adoption of one of the three alternatives in paragraph 5, or by an announcement that consideration of the mandates has been postponed in order to enable the mandatory to redraft them.Middle East Department, Colonial Office, June 8,1921.o
