13 TjOUU&amp;JOT 10 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT AM 10 MAJESTY18 QOVaHHMEMT).REPORT BY GEICTAL OFPICEK COMMNDING-IN-&apos; 01IIEP OH THE SITUATION IN IRELAND POfeWEEK ENDING 1ITH JTJH3, 1921.(Circulated by tho Secretary of State for War),GENERAL MILITARY SITUATION,The usual minor attacks on lorries carrying Grown Forces have continued during the week, but there is still an absence of any activities on a large soale by the rebels.The murder of civilians shows no sign of abatement, and the pretext that the victims are Government spies is in most cases purely fictitious.The blocking of roads continues on a large scale, and it is believed that the rebels attach great importance to the hindering of troops1 mobility by this means.On the 10th June, the 15th Infantry Brigade took over from the Londonderry Brigade the counties of Londonderry, Tyrone ^e&amp;awa&amp;ghand Donegal and the troops looated therein, the 15th brigade Area therefore now includes the &quot;six counties&quot;and Go. Donegal,The Headquarters of the Londonderry Brigade will move to Oundalk and take over on the 14th inst. the counties of cavan, Monaghan and Louth from the 15th Brigade.   These counties together with Co. Meath will constitute the 26th (Provisional) Brigade Area and will later be incorporated in the area of mblin District.The recent drive carried out by the Cavalry Brigade in the northern part of the 5th Divisional Area and in County Monaghan has not led to any large captures nor have any conflicts occurred but a few wanted men have been arrested^ Drives of this description have, however, a value beyond the Immediate results.   They have a good effect on the inhabit-ants who are tired of harbouring and assisting rebel Plying Columns; and, although owing to the impossibility of secrecy, captures are not. great, yet it is,probable that th, Rebel, illying    Columns are made to feel that their security, even in remote districts, is not assured.,-3052.C RE To0 A BINE T.(Sd).J.
