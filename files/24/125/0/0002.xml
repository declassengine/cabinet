They oanaox -register aB ordinary voters because their period of residenoe is broken by Military servioe (Ford v. Hart, L,R, 9 0epc273)f   and they are not qualified as ^Military voters&quot; beoause a man disoharged before June 15th will not on that date be na person who is serving&quot; as a member of the military forces (Representation of the People Act 1918, seo, 5(s)(i))6Relief in suoh oases was given by the Eleotoral Disabilities Removal Aot, 1891, but that Aot was repealed by the Representation of the People Aot, 1918, and was not re-enacted.The present Bill is not confined to the case of members of the Defenoe Porce and Reservists, but extends like the Aot of 1891 to any short period of absence on a servioe whioh prevents return home and therefore is held to break residence, e.g9, Merchant Seamen, Territorials on annual training, police absent from home on special dutyaThe following memo would be prefixed to the Bill!-*The object of this Bill is to exclude the possibility of its being held that residence for the purposes of the Representation of the People Aot, 1918, is interrupted by absence, for however short a time, under oonditions whioh preclude the possibility of return (Ford va Hart, L0R99. CaP0273), e,g., by service in the Defenoe Force, Territorial annual training or servioe in the Mercantile Marine.
