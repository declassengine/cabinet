^^n&quot;h^^uneat.is the Property of. Hat Britannic Majesty a Gavsmratsfttjtyl   Printed for the use of the Cabinet. June 1921.&amp; 8602SECRET.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES.AFTER consulting the Imperial Shipping Committee and obtaining the fott fl, concurrence of the Treasury*I propose at an early date to call for tenders with a view to resuming next year (1922-23) the Mail Service to the West Indies,&apos; which fell into abeyance during the war.The present position is most damaging to our interests and our prestige. Ever since 1842 there has been, save for insignificant periods, a regular mail service between this country and the West Indies. During the war the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company were obliged to withdraw the service, and owing to the unsettled conditions in the shipping world it has not yet been possible to make fresh arrange-in ents. The result is that we, the dominant power in the West Indies, are dependent for our communications with our oldest Colonies mainly on the services which the&apos; French and the Dutch Governments maintain to serve their comparatively insignificant interests in this part of the world.I should regard a continuance of this state of affairs with grave apprehension. The influence of the United States in these Colonies has greatly increased during the war. It is vigorously pushed both by commercial interests and by Government action, and is spreading. And the United States lose no chance of &quot;impressing on the people of our Colonies the preponderance of American power in these waters. It is difficult at the best to counteract American efforts, and without regular and assured com-munication with the mother country I fear that it will in the long run prove impossible.The cessation of the mail service was understood as a war measure. Our failure to resume it in any shape would be interpreted at home and abroad, and particularly in the United States, as a sign that our hold over these Colonies was weakening.Any relaxation of our hold on the West Indies would compromise our position as regards sugar and&apos;be bad for our trade in many ways. But, for the reasons mentioned, I would ask that the exceptional situation of the West Indies as regards steamship communication should be considered as one of Imperial importance apart from the economic aspects of the matter. Whatever view may be taken as regards shipping subsidies in general, I am satisfied that the exceptional circumstances of the West Indies entitle and require us to join in the subsidy which these Colonies are willing to pay for a regular service to this country.Apart from British Guiana, the area of the British Colonies is too small to provide sufficient, traffic of itself to make a service of the kind required on other grounds remunerative on commercial lines, and even if British Guiana is included the population of the area still remains inadequate so long as that Colony is un-developed. The whole population of the Colonies of British ^Guiana, Trinidad, Barbados, Windward Islands and Leeward Islands amounts to about 1,100,000 persons, and Jamaica is too far from the other Colonies to be conveniently included in an itinerary of steamers serving the Outer Antilles. Moreover, both the cargo trade and the passenger service are subject to marked seasonal fluctuations. There is a movement of passengers from the West Indies&apos; about April, and towards the West Indies about October. So far as purely cargo tonnage is concerned, the fluctuations do not. prevent an adequate service from being obtained on a commercial basis, but they are fatal to the maintenance of a regular passenger service, and create great difficulties in providing a regular cargo traffic which can sufficiently supplement the earnings of a mixed cargo and passenger type of vessel at times when the passenger traffic is small. Consequently the service does not appear to be one which, on purely commercial grounds, would of itself afford scope for privateWest Indian Passenger Steamship Service.[6407]
enterprise. The possibility of making a passenger service to the West Indies part of a service to other portions of the world has been carefully considered and for commercial reasons is impracticable.There is now no regular direct passenger service from the United Kingdom to any of the West Indian Colonies concerned, except a Dutch line which calls at Trinidad only. This service does not meet&apos; the needs of the West Indies since it does not provide sufficient accommodation, and moreover its steamers do not connect with the arrivals and departures of steamships sailing to other Colonies besides Trinidad. The Dutch line obviously only calls at the United Kingdom to fill up with passengers for the British Colonies. It is not dependent upon such passengers for the bulk of its revenues and therefore does not cater for the needs of the British Colonies.&apos;For purposes of commerce and development, a regular passenger service is essential to these Colonies. It is important for business men to know that they will be able to leave the Colonies and arrive at their destination on definite dates. The war has given a great impetus to American trade with the West Indian Colonies, and unless considerable efforts are made by this country to maintain a direct con-nection with the West Indies, the trade of&apos;the West Indian Colonies is likely to be diverted from its historic channels to the more natural geographical direction - of trade with the North American Continent, and one of the chief sources of supply of British grown sugar would be cut off from the home market and driven to obtain all its machinery, &amp;c, from North America. The absence of a regular passenger service with the United Kingdom will mean that it is difficult for business men to get easily from one country to another, and they will get out of the way of dealing with this country. This in its turn will directly cause a reduction in British exports and freights to the West Indies.Business men are, however, not the only persons who need the assurance of regular communications. Long and historic family associations lead many persons .in the United Kingdom or in the Colonies to wish to renew the ties which connect them with the other side of the ocean, and a regular steamer service also does much to encourage the use of the United Kingdom by West Indian families both as a health resort for themselves and for the education of their sons and daughters. From the administrative and political point of view it is obvious that these considerations are of great importance.While the conditions provide the opportunity for the development of a natural and expanding trade with Canada, the geographical advantages and present economic influence of the United States are so far greater than those of Canada that it appears to be out of the question to leave -the situation to be dealt with by Canada alone, quite apart from the breach with historic tradition which such a course would entail.As matters which are of special importance from an economic point of view, I would mention that Trinidad is one of the most important of our few British sources of petroleum, and that there are in British Guiana large deposits of bauxite, the ore of aluminium, which may be expected to increase the economic value of this part of the world in the future. It is clearly important that the development of these resources in particular should be in British hands, and it is difficult to see how this can be secured, in the face of increasing world competition, unless passenger communications with the United Kingdom remain reasonably good.It must be emphasised that, unless a great deal is done to counteract the growth of United States influence in the West Indies, the British position there will become gravely weakened both from the commercial and the strategic points of view. The West Indies at present strongly desire to remain within the British Empire, but they could hardly maintain this attitude if they became reduced to a condition of profound economic dependence upon the United States, and in that case circumstances might arise in which it would not be possible to resist their cession to that country.The West Indian Colonies have been asked to contribute to the cost of a Transatlantic Service. Trinidad, which is served by the Dutch line, is at present unwilling to do so, but both British Guiana and Barbados have offered to contribute. Certain of the Windward Islands will also be prepared to contribute, although it is not proposed that the line should call at any of those Colonies.It is regarded as essential that the proposed service should be a regular one sailing at fixed dates with sufficient passenger accommodation, between the United Kingdom and at least two out of the three Colonies of Barbados, Trinidad and
British Guiana, and that it should connect with an Inter-Colonial Service serving the Windward Islands and the Leeward Islands.Before the war the Colonies contributed 23,000/. a year to a Transatlantic Service and 12,500 . to an Inter-Colonial Service. His Majesty&apos;s Government contributed 40,000/. to a Transatlantic Service and 12,500/, to an Inter-Colonial Service. In return for the Imperial contribution His Majesty&apos;s mails were carried free of charge. No contribution is now asked for&apos; from His Majesty&apos;s Government to the cost of an Inter-Colonial Service, as an adequate service is maintained at the expense of the Canadian Government (to which the West Indian Colonies will also contribute later on).No reliable estimate can be made of the cost of a service at the present date, as this can only be decided by calling for tenders. The proposal to call for tenders has been submitted to the Imperial Snipping Committee, who have indicated that in the present circumstances relating to communications between the United Kingdom and the West Indies, and provided that His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the proposed subsidy is necessary on special Imperial grounds, they do not desire to raise any objection to the proposal. The Treasury have agreed to the principle of a contribution by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and the authority of the Cabinet is now requested for this expenditure being borne upon the Estimates for 1922-23. It is not proposed to wait until the opening of that financial year before entering into preliminary negotiations with any competent British Steamship Company which may be prepared to tender.I might add that the Postmaster-General has been consulted on the subject generally, and has no objection to the scheme so far as the Mail Service is. concerned. The Post Office would despatch by any subsidised service that may be established all mails for the West Indies that they can properly allocate to it.I should contemplate asking the Treasury to contribute three-quarters of the cost of any service subject to a maximum contribution to be settled between the Treasury and the Colonial Office when the tenders are received, but not in any case likely to be less than 90,000/. a year.W. S. C.Colonial Office, June 25, 1921.
