[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1921.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 13th instant.General State of the Country.Statistics of Outrages.There has been no change in the general state of the country since my last report. Attacks upon the Crown Forces have continued with undiminished frequency, but I am glad to state that the casualties, although high, are considerably below the total for last week. Police casualties for the week were 5 killed and 34 wounded, and Military casualties 2 killed and 1 wounded. Although numerous, the rebel attacks during the week were all on a very small scale, and gave rise to little actual fighting. Bombing outrages in crowded streets continue to be a regular feature of rebel operations, and, as usual, the casualties suffered by innocent civilians in these attacks exceeded the number inflicted upon the Police or Military. In the 9 outrages of this nature committed in Dublin during the past week 6 Auxiliaries were wounded and 1 civilian was killed and 7 wounded. The casualties sustained by the rebels them-selves are- unknown.Nine unsuccessful attacks on occupied Police barracks took place during the week, but resulted in no serious damage to any of the barracks, and the only casualty to the defending garrisons was one slight case of wounding.Two Courthouses (Clonakilty and Skibbereen, both Co. Cork) and 6 Coastguard Stations (Ballydonegan, Ballycrovane, Ballyvally, Gallyhead, Ringhar and Howes Strand, all in Co. Cork) were destroyed. In the case of Howes Strand, the 3 Coastguards composing the garrison were kidnapped by the rebels and their fate is still unknown.Other outrages for the week included 70 raids on mails. Four murders of civilians, attributable to Sinn Fein, were reported, the victims in 2 cases being ex-service men, and 2 attempted murders.Arrests for outrages and political offences numbered 60 for the week.Rioting in Belfast.    * , .The murder of a Constable of the Royal Irish Constabulary and the wounding of a Sergeant and another Constable in Belfast, about mid-day on the 10th instant, gave rise to dangerous disturbances, which broke out on the following day and con-tinued until the evening of the 12th instant. Rival crowds collected in the York Street and Falls Road areas early in the evening of the 11th instant, and the usual stone-throwing and revolver-shooting took place. The Police were compelled to fire in order to disperse the crowds, with the result that 16 persons were conveyed to the various hospitals suffering from gunshot injuries. Between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. the same night three men, all Roman Catholics, were dragged from their houses and taken away in motor cars by, bands of armed men wearing civilian dress, and their dead bodies were found the following morning some distance from their homes. One of the murdered men was an ex-service man, who had joined the Army at the age of 16 during the war and had been wounded in France.- Further rioting commenced towards the evening of the 12th instant, the Dock -Street and Falls Road areas being particularly affected.   The Police, in attempting[&apos;6 13-J&apos;lSECRET.CP.-3043.
to quell the disturbance in the Dock Street area were fired upon by the Sinn Fein section of the crowd and a Special Constable was shot dead. Order was restored before nightfall, and, with the exception of a certain amount of desultory sniping, no further outbreak of violence has since occurred, but party feeling continues to run high and may again become dangerous. In addition to the 2 Police Constables and 3 civilians above mentioned, 4 persons, one of whom was a girl, were killed during the disturbances and 23 persons were wounded. The greater number of these casualties were caused by the Police fire, but there can be no doubt that this action on the part of the Police was the only possible means of preventing much greater bloodshed. There is undoubtedly a deliberate attempt by Sinn Fein extremists to make Parliamentary Government in Northern Ireland impossible. There are also signs that the Sinn Feiners are trying to provoke a religious war in Ulster.  .Trials of Civilians by Court Martial.Forty-nine trials of civilians by Court Martial were concluded during the week and resulted in forty-four convictions and five acquittals. The following is an analysis of the sentences imposed : 23 sentences of penal servitude (3 years to 15 years).16 sentences of imprisonment with hard labour (1 year to 2 years).1 sentence of imprisonment without hard labour (6 months).4 fines (30s. to U).Total  44Sentence of 15 years&apos; penal servitude was imposed in three cases for the possession of arms&quot; and ammunition, in two cases for the possession of materials intended for the preparation of bombs, and in one case for attempting to obtain a revolver and ammunition by threats of violence. Sentence of 5 years&apos; and 3 years&apos; penal servi-tude respectively were imposed in the cases of two men convicted of having stolen a mail bag from a postman. Among the persons acquitted was a Special Constable of the Royal Irish Constabulary, who was charged with maliciously shooting and wounding a civilian.Internment Orders.The following figures show the position as regards internments up to the 11th instant: Total number of orders made      ...        ...        ...     3,604Orders-cancelled for reasons other than release       111 - Releases ordered ...        ...        ...        ...       307        418Total number of persons interned ...        ...        ...     3,186The number of appeals awaiting hearing is 18.State of the Police Forces.The recruiting figures for the Royal Irish Constabulary are slightly lower than those of last week, but the wastage from different causes has been considerably less. The net result is an increase of 24 in the strength of the Force, as compared with a net decrease of 13 last week. The figures for the Auxiliary Division show a net increase of 5. The following are the usual particulars of wastage and recruitment for the week :

As anticipated, the Nationalist and Sinn Fein members abstained from attendance. In view of the fact that His Majesty the King had signified his intention of opening the Parliament on the 22nd instant, the proceedings of the first meeting were limited to the taking of the oatji and the election of a Speaker, and the House therefore adjourned until that date. Although the day was not observed as a public holiday in Belfast, the large and enthusiastic crowds which turned out to witness the Viceregal procession to the City Hall furnished unmistakable evidence of the determination of the people of the Six Counties to make a success of their new Parliament. Despite the assumed attitude of cynical amusement adopted by the Dublin Nationalist and Sinn Fein press, which affects to believe that the self-government of the Six Counties is fore-doomed to failure, I am convinced that the sight of the Northern Parliament in being and functioning has already created a powerful impression upon Southern Irish opinion. If Mr. De Valera and his more moderate associates have any claim to statesmanship, they will not disappoint the hopes of the great majority of their supporters both in Southern and Northern Ireland, who are now looking to them to

At present it may well be that the moderate Sinn Fein Members of Parliament are dumb owing to their personal fear of the Irish Republican Army.H. G.Irish Office, S.W. 1, June 15, 1921.
