This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmeTit.J?/J  Memorandum by tho President of tho Board of Trade,OLimOAL THERiiOMETimS.CABINET.From an early sta^o oi&apos; the War hflavy demands for   olinioal thermometers were made by tho Army modical service the Navy and tho Air Poroo as well as by the Hospitals both at home and abroad, and arrangements were made for testing at the National Physical Laboratory all thermometers supplied under Ministry of Munitions contracts.   A large number of thermometers failed to reach the standard Imposed by the Ministry1s spooification, and it soon became evident that the rejects were getting into tho hands of Doctors in private practice and nurses in Hospitals. This condition of affairs was very undesirable, and it was felt that from the point of vim/ of national health an Order should be made which would render the-testing of ail clinical thermometerscompulsory.   After consultation with the Ministry of Health an order under the Defence of the Realm Aots was issued in October. 1918 by the Ministry of Liunitions requiring all clinical thermometers to bo tested before   oale,   *The value of the test very soon became manifest after the introduction of the compulsory Regulations,   Of tho first batohes which were forwardod to the Laboratory for examination an average of approximately 30$ failed to reach the standard.   In a relatively short timo the rejections had fallon to Z-i and this figure was still further reduced within the next fow months to This last figure represents avery fair average of rejections at tho present time in the case of British made thermometers.The majority of the clinical thermometers in use in this country before the war wore imported from Germany,   when foroign thermomotors again began to come in after the War and
were forwarded io the National phyoical Laboratory for test, it wan found that at .the outset about 40$ had to bo rejected In view of the failure to reach the standard.   In the case of some consignments, rejections have been as hiph as 80$ and the necessity for some such test for the protection of the user will be obvious.The requirement that clinical thermometers should be tested, being Imposed under the Defence of the Realm Acts, oould not In any case continue after the termination of the War.   In view therefore of the importance of the matter in relation to national health, the Ministry of Health when introducing their Miscellaneous Provisions Bill last Session inserted a Clause to render permanent the requirement that thermometers sold in this country should be tested; and although the Bill did not go through all its stages, this particular Clause was carried in Committee of the House of Commons,As all the Orders of the Ministry of Munitions under the Defence of the Realm Acts and Regulations were brought to an end on Slat March last, the Order requiring the testing of ol*n) oal thermometers la not now in force.The Departments concerned with Public Health in England and Wa^3s, Scotland and Ireland are all in agreement that legislation should be promoted by the Board of Trade to make the testing of clinioal thermometers compulsory.   The British manufacturers of thermometers are also strongly in favour of such legislation, which can be defended not only on ground of public health but also as a safeguard2 g
against the unfair competition of low grade foreign thermometers which can be offered cheaply because they are made without sufficient care of quality or accuracy.

It is proposed that the Bill should be based on the above-mentioned clause in the Ministry of Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill; and though the exact wording is not yet quite settled, the attached draft shows the general lines suggested.

It is important to add that as, under Treasury instructions, the fees charged at the National Physical Laboratory for testing clinical thermometers are adjusted to cover the expenses incurred, the Bill will not result in any fresh charge on the State.
