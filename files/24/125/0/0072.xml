k427FRANCE.During May the most disquieting manifestations of Communism were shown in the army, where anti-militarist propaganda was strong and well favoured by circumstances.In a conference from which many Moderates had withdrawn, the National Congress of French Railwaymen, which had decided at the first round not to adhere to Moscow, voted in the second by 55,140 votes to 53,677 in favour of adherence to the Third International.By acute dissensions within the C.G.T. the creation of a rival organisation is made probable.BELGIUM.The industrial outlook remains clouded, though the miners&apos; strike in England has improved work in the iron and coal industry.The shipping strike at Antwerp ended in the merchant service officers and seamen accepting the owners&apos; offer by a large majority.ITALY.The Russian Mission, having obtained provisional diplomatic immunity, will set itself seriously to the perfecting of a commercial treaty on the basis of the Krassin agreement.There are signs of lessened tenderness towards the Fascisti.SPAIN.The state of affairs is worse since grave unemployment is added to last year&apos;s troubles, and Spain is passing, through a financial crisis. In consequence of a conviction that the efforts of the authorities will not be able to exterminate the syndicates, an attempt is being made to transform the &quot; Sindicato Libre&quot; from a &quot; murder gang &quot; into a real workmen&apos;s association.NORWAY.The strike of the Norwegian sailors and firemen which broke out on May 8th developed into a general strike on May 26th. The strike movement, brought to a crisis by the general reduction of wages for ships&apos; engineers and seamen, gradually spread from the original disputants, the engineers on the coastal routes, to seamen and stokers on all routes, the clock transport workers, and finally labour generally, except State railways and hospital employees. From the first the Norwegian working man, essentially non-fanatic and peaceable, was unlikely to prove good material for the Red revolution and on June 10th the strike ended in the anticipated failure and was called off.SWEDEN.Unemployment, especially in the timber trade, is serious and promises to become worse. Feeling among workmen is very bitter, but motives of prudence have prevented big strikes and reductions in wages are being accepted all over the country.HOLLAND.The Labour movement is sick. Members of the National Workers&apos; Secretariat grow constantly fewer. In the division of the working classes the Workers&apos; Press is failing, as are also one-day strikes against reactionary laws. The result of revolutionary talk has been a strengthening of reaction,a 2
Kopp&apos;s organisation as a whole believes that the late putsch damaged the International Communist movement in Germany through splitting the party. Sahludowski, of the political department of Kopp&apos;s office, admits the Communist debacle and talks of the entire disintegration of the German Communists.The restoration of the old regime is viewed as possible through evolutionary processes working on the Gorman liking for a strong Government.There are rumours that all is not well in the deals between the German Heavy Industrials in Russia.SWITZERLAND.Irish propaganda, hitherto directed individually from Paris, is to be centralised and co-ordinated under a Swiss Committee. Paris appears to have agreed to the proposal in principle and to have suggested that similar centres should be formed in Holland and Sweden.RUSSIA.Reports emphasize the extent and urgency of the food crisis. The anxiety of the Soviet Government is reflected in their policy and in numerous proclamations. It appears to be Lenin&apos;s task to maintain discipline in the party and tranquillise simple souls perplexed by depar-tures from Communist orthodoxy ; Tchitcherin&apos;s to maintain relations with the foreign bourgeoisie and ZinoviefPs to organise the general staff of the world revolution. Tchitcherin&apos;s illness, however, and withdrawal to Odessa, leaving Litvinoff in command of the Foreign Office, is not likely to conduce to smoothness, as regards forejgn policy.The Third Congress of the Third International was to open at Moscow on June 5th, but has been twice postponed. The principal matters for discussion are the economic world crisis and the new tasks of the Inter-national ; the tactics of the International during the anticipated revolution and the transition period ; the relations with the Red Trade Union Inter-national ; the Eastern question ; the Women&apos;s Movement and the Young Communist Movement.Lenin&apos;s progress to the Right continues with, if anything, accelerated impetus.Litvinoff has been appointed as Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs in place of Karakhan.FINLAND.The failure of the German Putsch has disheartened the Finnish Communists aud the danger of an armed outbreak is sensibly diminish-Fishing. Secessions from the Extreme Left to the Social Democrat Party are reported.The Government is finding it difficult to keep the activities of the Bolshevik delegation within bounds.It has been decided that Russia may not send couriers through Finland to foreign countries without authority from the country of destination and the countries through which they have to pass.German propaganda and influence have assumed disquieting pro-portions, which the Minister of the Interior has taken steps to check.ESTHONIA.There are definite indications that the Bolshevik representative directs a Reval Transmission Point for the despatch of propaganda funds
4aand literature to Europe generally. Esthouian opinion welcomes the Anglo-Russian Trade Agreement, hoping that tho bulk of Anglo-Russian trade will pass through Esthonia.GREECE. &apos;The small but well organised and active Greek Communist Party is reported to be in close touch with the Bulgar Communists, and through them with Russia.BULGARIA.The Third Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party opened in Sofia on May 8th. The partial failure of recent efforts to enlist new adherents was explained away by a suggestion that the heads of the party are for the present chiefly concerned with consolidating and revising administration. A Bolshevik propaganda centre is reported to have been formed at Varna. Moscow, which supplies funds, uses the centre as a channel of its agitation in the Balkans.ROUMANIA.The once homogeneous Socialist Party has split into three factious-Communist, submitting to Moscow; Centre, Communist with reser-vations ; and Social Democratic, moderate in tendency.TURKEY.The orientation towards Moscow became definite and unmistakable in May. Mustapha Kemal has accepted the presidency of a new party of irreconcilables at Angora which stands for a definite rally to Moscow and a separation from the Entente.The policy of the, new Cabinet is apparently to be extremist and Eastern.The activity of the Bolshevik Trade Delegation in Constantinople is increasing.EGYPT.The split in the Egyptian parties is now complete. ZaglouPs recent policy appears to be aimed at embarrassing Adly and at maintaining his own claim as representative of the Egyptian nation. He explains his connections, through Dr. Hamed Mahmoud, with the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; by saying that the Egyptian Nationalists contracted with that newspaper because it was the only one in England willing to spread Nationalist propaganda. Hamed Mahmoud is one of ZaglouPs envoys to Europe to worry the official delegation. He is described as fairly able, quite amiable, and somewhat feeble, but hand in glove with the Egyptian Parliamentary Committee in Great Britain and likely to influence them.An emergence of Kemalist propaganda in Cairo and Alexandria is noted. Efforts are being made to form a Red Crescent Committee for the Kemalist forces and attempts are alleged at obtaining volunteers for the Kemalist Party. &apos;SYRIA.Moscow is reported to have decided to recognise the Poale Zion Communists as affiliated to the Third International and to help them by funds and propaganda. As a bait for Arabs and Egyptians, the party no longer calls itself &quot;Jewish.&quot; Extremists are reported to have been carrying on. an extensive Communist propaganda amongst Jewish workers.
TURKESTAN.The steady Rtissification of the country and the control of adminls-tration by Russians deputed from Moscow is noted. Its economic life has been destroyed and it is believed impossible for the Bolsheviks to restore it. Bolshevik propaganda directed by the Baku Council of Action and Propaganda is aimed solely at Great Britain and is largely effective, since there is no one to refute it.SIBERIA.In the coup aVetat Vladivostock, the Reds were overthrown and a new Government, headed by Merkuloff, established. Japanese policy is very cautious. It would appear to prefer either Semenoff or the Com-munists, but does not want democracy.JAPAN.The police have raided the headquarters of the Japanese Radical Party and arrested several leaders.CANADA.The great body of labour appears to be revolted by Bolshevik propaganda and disunion has broken out among the revolutionists. Communist agitation continues to progress in Western and Northern Ontario. Revolutionaries in Vancouver are disappointed by the un-expectedly peaceful progress of the British strike. The situation in the lumber camps is unsettled and a strike throughout them may be called when the new organisation is complete.AUSTRALIA.Business and professional leaders, as well as workers, have been warned that a serious crisis is approaching and that a reduction in wages is essential. Government subsidies or sustenance doles will not be given.Peter Simonoff, the Soviet Russian Consul in Sydney, is in dire need of funds, and has appealed urgently to Tchitcherin for money. He is reported to be in close and friendly co-operation with the Italian Consul-General in Australia.UNITED STATES OP AMERICA.It is said that there have never been so many unemployed in the United States as there are to-day. Wages of men employed in the leading industries during the year ending March 31st have decreased on an average of 6&apos; &amp; per cent. The right to work has been vindicated by a decision given in the Supreme Court at New York, where it was laid down that a man may work or not as he shall choose ; he may strike and peaceably seek others to join, but he may not be compelled to join a union if he is not disposed to do so.MEXICO.Indignation and unrest have been caused by the latest executive measures for breaking up large estates and establishing the small landowner.
Confidential.429A Review of Revolutionary Movements in Foreign Countries.PART I.1. LATIN COUNTRIES,FRANCE. Moscow and Communist Prospects.- Moscow is reported to be following closely events in France, and, undeterred by previous failures, to have decided to launch a fresh revolutionary campaign. In this connection the Paris Committee of the Third International (Croup Souvarine and Monatte) has informed Moscow that the interior situation in France gives fresh hopes, thanks to increasing unemployment and financial embarrassment. The Extremists are confident that if their hopes are not realised before September they can at any rate be certain that at the National Congress of the C.G.T., Monmousseau, Tommasi, and Monatte will replace Jouhaux and his friends, so that French syndicalism will be in the hands of men who will lead it along the real revolutionary path. It is admitted that the masses in France are in no. way disposed to follow a movement in favour of German Communists. &quot; We have not been able to respond as we should &quot; have liked to the appeal of the Third International. But the progress &quot; of the strike in England will no doubt supply new ground on which &quot; the directions of the Executive Bureau of Moscow can be carried out.&quot; The Committee demur, on account of the grave risks involved, to the suggestion of the Third International to forge French bank notes with which to carry on propaganda work. . They promise, however, to study the technical side of the project received from Moscow, and, if possible, to adapt it to the situation.Acting on the instructions of the Soviet, Kopp is said to have ordered Vorovski in Rome to use every means to stir up labour unrest in France during the spring; so as to embarrass the Government. Vorovski has been charged to tell -the French comrades that their inactivity displeases the Soviet and has called forth the anger of the Executive Committee of the Third International.The Communist Campaign.The most disquieting manifestations of Communism are at present shown in the Army, where anti-inilitarist propaganda was never so Strong and never so well favoured by circumstances. The calling to the colours of the 1919 class has caused, dissatisfaction, and mutinies have occurred in several centres. In some cases as many as 400 men have had to be confined to barracks under guard. The &quot; Humanite &quot; which now draws 300,000 copies, sends 100,000 to the Rhine Army of Occupation. A number of militant Young Communists have been arrested in connection with the placarding of Paris with anti-militarist bills, and &quot; L&apos;Humanite &quot; itself is being prosecuted for having reprinted a poster condemning the mobilisation of the 1919 class.   In connection
with the anti-militarist campaign, the Germans, who have kept their espionage organisation in Switzerland, are said to bo organising anti-militarist propaganda in France. They aro recruiting agents in Switzerland, charged with establishing contact with tho French militant revolutionaries and penetrating the ex-Service men&apos;s organisations, the groups of Young Communists and of Intellectuals such as the Clarte group.The Communists are also engaged in subverting the Trades Unions. The railwaymen of the State Railways have passed a resolution of adherence to the Third International, rejecting a more moderate resolution in favour of a collaboration of classes and the Second International. The miners and the Federation of Builders have recently adopted Communist principles.The National Congress of French Railwaymen, which decided at the first round not to adhere, to Moscow, decided in the second and more important round by 55,140 votes to 53,677 to turn to the Reds. This victory has been gained in a conference from which many moderates had withdrawn, but it will naturally strengthen the extremists, who will exploit it to the. uttermost. The delegates of the Nord-Belge, who would have voted for the defeated Majority Socialists, were not allowed to vote on the ground that they did not bear the. federal railwaymen&apos;s card. It must be remembered that the Railwaymen&apos;s Federation has had its strength reduced from 300,000 to 100,000 as a result of the strike fiasco last year. M. Bidegaray, the secretary-general, and a number of the other Majority Socialists withdrew from the meetings in protest against the demand of the extremists for proportiouary representation on the already elected federal council.The extremists have meanwhile formed a Central Committee against War, which organised an open air meeting on May 8th. This demon-stration passed off without incident, but the later attempts of the participants to enter Paris ended in firing and bloodshed. The large Communist demonstration in Pere Lachaise Cemetery on May 30th was followed by one of the biggest police raids for many years. Many prominent officials of the Communist Party had their premises searched. Searches were also carried out at the offices of the Seine Federation of Communists and of the Association of ex-Service Men.Vaillant-Couturier, Treint, Morucie, Blanc, and Tommasi have left as delegates for the Congress of the Third International. The Com-munist Centres hope that this Congress will result in a settlement of the Eastern and Bosphorus questions, and in a declaration from Lenin and Trotsky so sedative as to calm the fears of even the French Imperialists.Communist Conferences.The most active extremist group iu France to-day is the &quot; Jeunesses Communistes,&quot; which is under the direct orders of Tommasi, Leclcrc, Cachin, and Frossard. The Young Communists who seceded six months ago from the old Socialist Party have decided to place themselves under the patronage of the Communist Party now that that body adheres to the Third International. The Young Communists will shoulder anti-militarist propaganda.The recent Congress of the Communist Party in Paris, the first since the split at Tours, was important in that it gathered from the provinces more than 150 delegates, hitherto adherents of the Unified
Socialists, who brought the adhesion of their federations to the now party. These delegates represent 80,000 militants. The propaganda commission of *the party has divided Franco into 13 regions, and appointed a secretary-general for propaganda for each who will be directly under the Directing Committee of Paris. Frossard, tho secretary-general, painted a rosy picture, declaring that 94 federations were affiliated to the party, one less than the number affiliated to tho original Socialist Party.   Financially the party was prosperous.The Struggles of the C.G.T.The recent meeting of the &quot;National Confederal Committee of the c.t.. discussed external and internal policy internal policy having reference chiefly to the indiscipline of the communistically minded minority, which is paralysing the activities of the Confederation. The debate, bandying accusation and counter accusation, was very confused. It ended in the passing of a resolution ascribing the present impotence of the c.t.. to the obstruction of the organised opposition and declaring that the only remedy was a meeting of the National Congress which should define the policy of the OCT., and prescribe the means by which this was to be carried out. The date of the next Congress has been advanced from September to the latter part of July. As regards external policy the Committee condemned the use of armed force against Germany and supported the programme for reconstruction of the devastated region, proposed by the recent Congress of the Second International at Amsterdam.The creation of a rival organisation to the c.t.. is within the range of probability, in view of present dissensions. The Communists possess the nucleus of a rival organisation in the extremist association of trade unions of the Seine which fomented the disastrous general strike in May of last year. This association has decided to admit all those unions which were excluded from the Federation because of their insistence on affiliation with the Third International. Tho extremists have, however, suffered a check. Monmousseau&apos;s motion censuring the officials of the c.t.. has been rejected by 80 votes against 34.Russian Affairs.Krassin has protested categorically to Moscow against the granting of any powers whatsoever to private individuals for opening business offices in Paris, Such an action, he says, would destroy the work of the last months, and the distance from a favourable official settlement of this question is no longer great.On May 13th Russian emigres held a meeting in London for the election of delegates for the June Paris Congress, which is being arranged by Bourtseffs Party. Motions to the effect that the London emigres must acknowledge the Commission of Members of the Constituent Assembly as the supreme organ of all the emigres in Europe, and that the Paris Zemstvo-Urban Council be acknowledged as the supreme organ were rejected. Another motion avoiding political questions and confining itself to the proposal that a temporary commission be elected was passed. This commission is to select a representative for the Paris Congress and to put the question concerning political self-determination of the emigres to a further ballot.Zalewski&apos;s Expulsion; A Protest.As was stated in last month&apos;s Review, Zalewski, the &quot;Eye of Moscow,&quot; was arrested by the Swiss Police on his expulsion from
France. The leaders of the French Communist Party and Zalewski&apos;s barristers immediately protested to the Swiss Government that this action. was contrary to international law, Zalewski being a political offender and having also received a Swiss visa.Questioned during his journey to the Swiss frontier on the present ideas of Leuin, Zalewski declared that the Soviet Government was in a stato of retrogressive revolution. &apos;.BELGIUM.The Labour Situation: Failure of Strikes.The miners&apos; strike in England has improved work in the iron and coal industry; but the industrial outlook remains clouded. In the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg industrial depression is almost as bad as in Belgium. Signs of an industrial revival, notably in the iron and steel industries, are, however, said to be apparent. The general labour situation is quieter after the alarms of the early part of May, when the Antwerp Dockers&apos; Union refused to load coal for the United Kingdom. This action is said to have been the outcome of the visit to Great Britain of Joseph de Jardin and Henri de Man, two prominent members of the Belgian Socialist Party.Very little success attended the efforts of the Antwerp dockers to win over the railwaymen, miners, and dockers in other ports to support their action. Sympathetic action at Ghent and Brussels soon collapsed; the only result has been an angry feeling at Antwerp, where it is felt that the local strike failed because the Dutch dockers did not support it. Only the miners at Roux in the Charleroi district, the seat of extremist movements, have shown any signs of supporting the British, and their activity has not gone beyond a resolution against overtime and unrestricted output.The shipping strike at Antwerp ended in the merchant service officers and seamen accepting the shipowners&apos; offer by a large majority. Strikes by the railwaymen and the miners have been threatened, but the danger of immediate action would appear to have passed. Even if a strike were called, many men would refuse to come out. The Government has taken precautionary measures.A strike at the Ougree-Marihaye works was attended by much disorder, owing to the enrolment of volunteers to do indispensable work. The miners of the Ougree-Marihaye pits struck to support the other workers.Owing to the threatened railway strike and the dockers&apos; strike at Antwerp many iufluential citizens have formed themselves- into a Civic Union, pledged to fill the places of strikers in any department of the public services. A similar movement is proceeding in Brussels and other large towns.Many Belgian industries are adopting an extensive scheme of profit sharing amongst the workers in the hope of concentrating lightning strikes and labour trouble generally.Communism and Socialism.Suspicion is strong that a movement exists directed to welding into a&apos; single group the &quot; Confederation Communiste Beige &quot; and &quot; Les Amis de l&apos;Exploite.&quot; The jealousy between the respective leaders^ Van Over-straeten and Jacquemotte, has often been emphasised. On account of this jealousy Moscow is said to favour replacing Van Overstraeten by Schmickrath, a well-known Belgian anarchist, who is in fact reported to
have been deputed by Moscow to reorganise Belgian Communism. He is said to have been expelled from Franco and to be in England now with a German woman, named Anna Maria Emonts.The Extremist Socialists seceded from the Belgian Socialist Party at the end of May and decided to form a Belgian Communist Party affiliated to the Third International. The official Socialists are glad to be rid of this group, which was a corroding influence. Although the Communists profess to oppose the Parliamentary system, they will present candidates at the elections in October.The &quot;Jeunes Gardes Socialistes&quot; held their annual conference at Brussels in May. The Jeunes Gardes now number 12,000 members ,under 14 years of age, and 13,000 over that age. There was much debate over the furthering of education in socialism and the creation of a committee for this purpose. The Federation engaged to continue its efforts to organize a meeting of the &quot; Jeuues Gardes &quot; of the World. A closer union will be cultivated with the Vienna organization, which is growing in importance. As regards military service, the Congress declared that to fight for disarmament was the best means for the proletariat to maintain the autonomy of nations. The &quot; Anciens Com-battants Socialistes &quot; have decided to combine with the &quot; Jeunes Gardes &quot; in their anti-militarist propaganda, and to struggle against war by a general revolutionary strike in case of mobilisation,Miscellaneous.The group of &quot; Les Amis de 1&apos;Exploite &quot; has opened a subscription which is meeting with scant support, in aid of the children of the English miners.Joseph Dejardin and,Henri Deman have been in London as delegates from the All-Belgium Labour Party to discover the attitude of the British Labour Party towards the proposed occupation of the Ruhr.ITALY.Vorovsky&apos;s Mission to Italy.Early in May activity against the Communists had so relaxed that Vorovsky was receiving telegrams en clair from Moscow. The action of the Government in checking agitation seems to have been determined by political reasons. It should not be taken, however, that the Govern-ment is indifferent to the i Bolshevik menace, and it is hoped that a permanent and close liaison may be established between the Italian authorities and the representatives of foreign countries who are interested in counter-Bolshevism. The police themselves are under no illusions as to Vorovsky&apos;s real activities. They know that Italy is becoming a very important Bolshevik centre, and that Vorovsky has under him a group of minor representatives in Rumania, Hungary, German Austria, and the Balkan States. There are suspicions, but no definite evidence that the terrorist attempt was linked up with Vorovsky&apos;s arrival in Italy. The decoding by the Foreign Office of Vorovsky&apos;s wireless messages has, however, revealed nothing startling, for the simple reason that anything secret for Moscow goes by courier.Meanwhile, in spite of the accommodating spirit of the Government, the Bolshevik Mission proved themselves difficult, and crowned a pretty game of bluff by asking for their passports, alleging that they had not received the diplomatic privileges originally promised to thorn, and that they had obtained no definite statements from the Government. Wounded dignity had some part in this action, because the man who assaulted
Vorovsky in his hotel recently has been acquitted amid uncomplimentary remarks from the judgo concerning Bolsheviks. Nearly all the members of the Mission have had their bill of insults and humiliations, chiefly from the Fascisti.Another reason alleged is that VoroYsky attempted to subordinate the signing of the commercial agreements to the recognition on the part of Italy of the Soviet Government, including recognition of himself as Soviet representative and of his jurisdiction over Russian subjects living in Italy. All this bluster seems to have been so far successful that it has secured Vorovsky provisional diplomatic immunity for two months, which will either be prolonged or will lapse if an agreement is or is not reached. Now that diplomatic privileges and immunity have been obtained, the mission will set itself seriously to the perfecting of a commercial treaty on the basis of the Krassin agreement.Extremist Movements.Giovanni Giglio, formerly Rome correspondent of the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; and now correspondent to the Norwegian Labour Party&apos;s press office, has informed the party that secret Councils of Action are directing communist activities at Trieste, Florence, Venice, Spezia, Rome, Genoa, and Milan.One of the organs of Bolshevik propaganda in Italy is the &quot; Italo-Russian Wireless Agency,&quot; controlled and financed by Vorovsky&apos;s Mission and connected with a weekly review &quot; La Russia dei Soviet.&quot; A third-rate journalist named Paununzio, who has sold himself to Bolshevism, conducts both the agency and the review.The Amsterdam International has decided to give financial support to the General Confederation of Labour in its struggle against reaction.A Communist outbreak at Cremona necessitated the calling out of the troops and the employment of machine guns. Numerous casualties are reported.The authorities are reported to have expelled Sebalt J. Rutgers, who is now in Berlin, where it is hinted that he may not be allowed to remain undisturbed.The Fascisti.There is much speculation as to the attitude the Fascisti will take in the new Chamber. They oppose the foreign policy of the Government and they will be absent from the Royal opening of Parliament owing to their Republican tendencies. It is expected that moderate Socialists of the type of Signor Turati will be invited to join the Government.There are signs of lessened tenderness towards the Fascisti. The Milan police have raided their headquarters and arrested Pasella, their national secretary.Signor Giulietti, known as a revolutionist and secretary of the Italian Federation of Seamen, is said to be attempting to transfer the allegiance of the Federation of Seamen from the Socialist Party to the Fascisti.Sinn Fein.Gavan Duffy appears to be in relations with Bela Szekula, a former Commissar for Finance under the Hungarian Soviet.One of the jackals of Sinn Fein in Rome is the Rev. James P. Conry, a low-class Irish priest, who does dirty work for. the notorious Mgr. Hagen and presumably for Gavan Duffy. Mgr. Hagen is said to have complained of the lack of sympathy shown to Sinn Fein by the
&quot;Osservatore Romano,&quot; the official organ of the Vatican. Cardinal Gasparri appears to have given orders that tho paper was not to feature the pro-Sinn Fein meeting held recently at the Eliseo Theatre.Miscellaneous.The Afghan Mission has arrived in Rome.All the.members of the Rome Municipality have been on &quot;strike.Abdul Hamid Said has protested against a press statement that the League of Oppressed Oriental Nations, of which he is secretary, is inciting the Tripolitans to persist in their demands for autonomy under - a native ruler. He flatters Italy by declaring that the League looks for support to her only in all Europe.The position at Bologna, which has been under Socialist rule since 1914, has already been mentioned in the RevieAV. The financial deficit of the municipality would appear to amount to 15,000,000 lire, entailed by reckless expenditure. For instance, street cleaners were paid 12,000 lire a year. An estate presented to the hospital and formerly bringing in an income of 700,000 lire a year now shows a deficit of 23,700 lire. In Ferrara, also governed by the Socialists, the Syndic is in prison and has been proved to have enriched himself by various means to the amount of 100,000 lire.SPAIN.The Internal Situation.Through Parliament and the press, Socialists and Republicans have been seeking to bring about a return of tranquillity in Barcelona, where official returns show that 230 persons were assassinated during the first four months of this yoar. They argue that the first step must be taken by a return to legality on the part of the Government. They ask for abrogation of the suspension of the constitutional guarantees, the cessation of the practice of imprisoning without trial, a more humane treatment of prisoners, the cessation of administrative measures taken against the syndicates and other workmen&apos;s associations, the denial of clandestine support to the Barcelona &quot; Sindicato Libre,&quot; and the removal of Anido and his replacement by a civilian with a policy of conciliation and return to the ordinary law. The Government have made some concession in regard to prisoners, but they declare that a return to the normal procedure of arrest and trial is impossible as long as a campaign of outrage and terror continues. Anido is declared to continue to enjoy the confidence of the Government, and connivance at the activities of the &quot; Sindicato Libre &quot; is continued.At long last, however, an attempt is being made to transform the &quot; Sindicato Libre&quot; -from a murder gang into something approaching a real workmen&apos;s association. The authorities have realised that the workman demands a union, and failing a sound institution will join a revolutionary one. The employers are the promoters of the new scheme. If they can successfully overcome suspicion, they should, with careful handling, make the new association a success.This action follows upon a conviction that the efforts of the authorities will not be able to exterminate the syndicates. The suppression of one committee is quickly followed by the organisation of another, and subscriptions are ominously increasing. It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that the state of affairs is worse, since grave unemployment is added to last year&apos;s troubles. Spain is passing through a financial crisis of which the failure of the Bank of Barcelona was an important incident, and not the primary cause.  In addition to- the
financial crisis, employers of labour find their lives threatened on two counts, one because they are employers, the other to force them to subscribe to the Syndicalist funds. In fact, the employers are themselves among the chief supports of the party Avhose one aim is to do away with them altogether.Some modification of the situation may be brought about by the new party, the &quot; Communista Obrero &quot; Party, which has appeared as a result of the Socialist split, and which may soon rival the Confederacion. The Confoderacion has hitherto rejected politics or constitutional methods, though the Communists, here parting company with Moscow, wish to use Parliament. A compromise between the two parties is possible. The old leaders of the Confederacion are becoming more moderate.Mancomunidad and Syndicalists.Certain signs point to possible collusion between the Mancomunidad and the Syndicalists. It may be taken that if an offer of definite alliance has been made the offer has come too late ; it might have been accepted a year ago, but the Syndicates have since suffered too much from the Mancomunidad and Somaten to be inveigled into plucking chestnuts from the fire. Up to the present all offers have been refused. The move was, in its origin, a parliamentary one, and parliamentary demands with all the strength of the alliance behind them were to have followed it. The fact that the move was to be a parliamentary one had probably a good deal to do with its failure, as the Syndicalists distrust and dislike constitutional methods.The Spanish Communists.Generally speaking, syndicalism in Spain to-day is Communist with auarchistic tendencies a means to an end and not an end in itself. The Communist Party has made great progress in the last two months.There seems to be little present prospect of an amalgamation of the two existing Communist parties. The disagreement is one of persons rather than of ideas. The older and more extreme party broke away from the Socialists in 1920 ; the other party is not yet organised, but it is attracting many ex-socialists, and will have to be reckoned with in the future.The National Confederation stand to gain by last month&apos;s secession, since the Socialist Party is one with the Union General and the Extremists will join the more violent Confederation. The Union, which is a moderate labour organisation, has been declining for some time owing, it would appear, to the growing distrust of Parliament engendered by bad administration and neglect of the social question.Police Reorganisation in Madrid.The incompetence shown by the Madrid police on the occasion of Dato&apos;s murder has resulted in the superannuation of the chief Torres Almunia, who has been replaced by Millan Millan de Priego. The organisation has been drastically overhauled, with results that cannot yet be defined.PORTUGAL.The latest Revolution.Another turn has been given to the kaleidoscope of Portuguese politics by a bloodless coup in which Machado&apos;s government has fallen. Barros Queiroz has formed a cabinet on condition that there should be a dissolution of Parliament. Lisbon has taken the situation with the philosophic calm of old habit.
miscellaneous.Threatened strikes on the Lisbon tramways and the Sud and Sud-Oeste railways have not eventuated. In the case of the South-Western Eailway the Government threatened to appoint Colonel Raul Esteves to deal with the situation. His very name filled the would-be strikers with fear.May 1st passed off without trouble. A good deal of hot air was talked and there was some waving of red flags nothing more. The Government prohibited certain meetings.2. scandinavian countries, norway.the general strike.The threatened strike of the Norwegian sailors and firemen broke out on May 8th. On May 11th it was reported to be as complete as possible and to have seriously dislocated coastal traffic. It was, as had been threatened, the prelude to a general strike. The proposal of the Liberal Party to avert this disaster by the establishment of an Arbitration Court to which all labour disputes could be referred by the Government, was rejected by the Storthing ; negotiations between the sailors&apos; and the shipowners&apos; representatives failed, and the general strike broke out on May 26th. 130,000 or 150,000 organised workers are involved. State employees are not included. The Government has taken all appropriate measures to secure order. The sale ef wine has been prohibited. No newspapers are appearing in Christiania except the Bolshevist &quot; Social Demokrat.&quot; There has been some rioting in Christiania, and there are rumours that a sort of Soviet has been set up in Hammerfest. The public remains calm.The present dispute has been maturing for a long time, and has been brought to a crisis by the general reduction of wages for ships&apos; engineers and seamen on an extensive scale. A year ago the membership of the Arbitration Court very strongly favoured the men ; this year the men feel that they can look for little sympathy from the present National Arbitrator. The strike movement has gradually spread from the original .disputants, the engineers on the coastal routes, to seamen and stokers on all routes, the dock transport workers, and finally labour generally, except State and hospital employees. The State employees include the railwaymen, whose attitude is at present uncertain.Matters have been so arranged that Folkets Hus can reasonably claim that the strike is purely economic, for the protection of labour. Folkets Hus is, however, not without serious misgivings. Strike funds are short; the reorganisation of the Norwegian Labour Party on Com-munist lines will be seriously interfered with, and a fiasco such as resulted from the railway strike in December will jeopardise the existence of the Norwegian Labour Party. Sympathetic action by other countries is doubtful; witness the refusal of assistance to the seamen by the British Seamen and Firemen&apos;s Union. The Norwegian Labour Party have stated that in order to conserve their funds for a possible long struggle, no strike pay will be issued from the day of the breaking out of the big strike. This, with the consequent probability of hunger and violent action, may point to intrigues by Moscow. It is significant that &quot; reliable,&quot; otherwise violently inclined elements, will receive funds privately, and that the Norwegian Labour Party leaders and officials who forego their salaries during the strike, will keep themselves going
out of propaganda funds. Whatever happens, nobody but Moscow seems likely to be the gainer. It cannot be said that the strike is popular. The extreme section is in charge for the moment and will give a revolutionary turn to events on the least opportunity.Moscow and Revolution.In connection with suggestions of revolution it was reported towards the middle of May that Kopp had iuformed the Norwegian Labour Party that Moscow regarded Norway as possibly ready for revolution, but thought that isolated action would at present have little chance of permanent success. Such action was, therefore, deprecated before the late autumn November is suggested by which time it is considered that a valuable ally will bo found in serious unemployment. Even then Moscow has its doubts of the final success of an isolated Norwegian action, and would prefer a joint Swedo-Norwegian attempt. This is, however, impossible in the near future, since Moscow recognises that revolutionary enthusiasm is no glowing fire in Sweden.As far as Norway is concerned, in spite of the recent apparent progress of Communism and the identification of Folkets Hus with extremism, the Norwegian working man, who is essentially non-fanatic and peaceable, is said to be hardly likely to prove good material for the Red revolution, though revolutionary sentiment and dissatisfaction with the Government undoubtedly exist. Tranmael is probably the only leader Avho could rouse revolutionary enthusiasm, and he lacks real heart for the game owing to his rooted dislike of the Jewish clique in Moscow, a dislike shared by the saner and more patriotic elements of labour. Success in the industrial centres could only be temporary, since it would break on the conservatism of the farmer and on Norwegian dependence on oversea imports. Any lasting revolutionary coup could only be achieved in concert with a similar movement in neighbouring countries. A fleeting local success in North Norway is possible but improbable. Meanwhile Tranmael himself doubts the will of labour to obey orders, and declares that the Moscow theses are too academic to be grasped by the ordinary worker, Haakon Meyer indicates that there is one hope  a &quot; special secret corps of terror &quot; to drive society and labour into civil war.The Young Communists.As was mentioned in last month&apos;s report, the &quot; Norwegian Social Democratic Youth Federation,&quot; consisting of a group of between 500 and 1,000 young extremists, dissenting from the Young Socialists, re-baptised itself the &quot; Norwegian Young Socialist Communist Federa-tion during April. However, now that the &quot;Young Socialists&quot; have become &quot; Young Communists,&quot; the dissidents are willing to be affiliated with them, retaining a separate organisation. They have placed them-selves at the disposal of the Central Committee of the Norwegian Labour Party for illegal &quot; special&quot; activities, such as sabotage and literature smuggling.Russian Gold.It is reported that 1,600 kilograms of gold, said to bear the stamp of the Norwegian official assayer, were shipped at Christiania on May 10th by the Norske Credit Bank for the account of the Goteborg Bank, Stockholm, consigned to the National Bank of Commerce of New York. There is no doubt of the Russian origin of this gold. It was also reported that a similar shipment of about 1,200 kilograms would be probably
leaving Christiania&apos;on May 14th. The Swedish postal authorities have been informed that the Norwegian postal authorities are not authorised to send gold to America.Miscellaneous.May Day demonstrations at Christiania were uninteresting and demonstrators few. The crowd was apathetic, especially towards Moscow and Russia.At the end of April the Government refused an increase of wages demanded by the workers at the Kalnes works, where parts and sections of Norwegian submarines are made, and dismissed the 300 employees. It is rumoured that some of the men and foremen were of great service to Moscow.Though he is the subject of criminal proceedings, the Norwegian Government permitted Sverre Krogh, editor of the Bergen &quot; Arbeidet,&quot; to proceed to Russia as a representative of the Norwegian Labour Party to the Executive Committee of the Third International. Krogh was arrested in Finland, bearing Communist literature and compromising letters. Certain members of the Bergen Commercial Association appear to have used Krogh as their representative for transactions in Russia, an action of which the Association, as a body, strongly disapproved. There is a suggestion that behind the action of the Government lay the hope that Krogh would not return.-SWEDEN.The Unemployment Crisis.Unemployment is very serious, especially in the timber trade, and promises to become worse. There are fewer big strikes, probably from motives of prudence, for the feeling among workmen is very bitter. Reductions in wrages are being accepted all over the country. Dismissals are still taking place, though optimists profess to believe that the climax has been reached. The Government is doing what it can by out of work benefits and by finding work. The committee charged with providing State employment in Stockholm has recently received a further 200,000 kr. for the purpose. The Riksdag has voted in all 11,000,000 kr. for providing work, and already 5,000 men have been found employment. The Prime Minister informed a deputation of the unemployed, which demanded trades union rates of pay, that it was necessary to pay a much lower rate than prevailed in the open labour market in order to avoid the competition of Government schemes with private employers.Extremist Movements.A newspaper called, in condemnatory terms, the attention of Swedish Labour youth to Lenin&apos;s statement: &quot; Should it be necessary one must understand even the practising of artifices, the making use of cunning &quot; and illegal methods and the concealing of the truth in order to get into &quot; the trades unions and remain there, and. complete our communistic &quot; work among the members.&quot;The split in the late Left Socialist Party does not favour Moscow as greatly as has been claimed. The cautious members who did not vote on the 21 points appear to be supporting Vennerstrom, a line of action which is being followed by many who voted for the 21 points on the understanding that those who opposed them should not be rejected by the, main body. Finding a split unavoidable, they prefer to side with the less extreme.   As against this a few country branches of the lateO  AS 8868 B
Left Socialist Party are proclaiming allegiance to the new Communist Party.A new society to be known as the &quot; Swedish Forest and Agricultural Workers&apos; Association,&quot; with branches all over the country, has been formed. It will take the place of the old Association. Its aims are revolutionary and it declares that employers must not be allowed to reduce wayes. The Third International and the Red Trade Union International are supported, and the Amsterdam International is con-demned as only wishing to improve the present system.The Swedish Agricultural and Industrial Workers&apos; Co-operative Society is a body controlled by the Communist Party through the Central Committee for Scandinavian Revolutionary - and Specialist Labour organisations, itself a committee within the Communist Party, including Hoglund, 0. Grimlund, Einar Ljungberg, and Strom. This society has been formed with tho object of acquiring land on a co-operative basis, to be owned by and worked for the benefit of its members, who must all be communists. Larsen, commissioned as organiser, has been ill, and on his recovery found himself unable, through lack of funds, to continue his activities. The society is hoping, however, to resume agitation with funds provided by the Communist Party. Three agitators will be employed Larsen from Stockholm, another man from Gothen-burg, and a third who will work in the north of Sweden.The law-abiding &quot; Landsorganisation &quot; has been stirred to action by the campaign waged against it by the &quot; Trades Union Propaganda Committee,&quot; on which open war has now been declared. The &quot;Lands-organisation &quot; declares that the influence for evil exercised by the Committee cannot be exaggerated,The Swedish &quot; Syndicalist Organisation &quot; is reported to number some 32,000 members. It has no leader, but is organised by a committee. The whole body of members decides important matters by vote. The society publishes a bi-weekly organ, &quot;The Syndicalist,&quot; which may become a daily next January, and which has the distinction of paying all the members of its staff, from typist to editor, the same salary.A meeting held in Stockholm, attended by representatives of workers in all branches of food producing industries, and presided over by &quot;Ottosson,&quot; the real chairman of the Bolshevik Propaganda Committee, decided that employees of food industries should form an association to bring dowu food prices, if necessary by taking measures to control the works.Trade with Russia.Kerjentseff is alleged to be so deeply involved financially that he may be put into the Bankruptcy Court, the expulsion of the Trade Delegation from Sweden eventually followiug. It appears that Kerjentseff recently placed a printing contract of 1,500,000 kroner with a local firm, which on pressing for payment was referred to the Centrosoyus, on the ground that Kerjentseff is a member of that body. The Centrosoyus in turn disclaimed all responsibility as being a part of the Trade Delegation. :Krassin is reported to have brought with him the sanction of the Soviet to several schemes involving trade relations with Scandinavian countries. One scheme concerns the operation of a line of steamers between Stockholm and Petrograd, which will require considerable subsidy from the Soviet Government. Krassin was to meet Swedish bankers interested in the proposition. The formation is rumoured of a Russo-Swedish bank similar to the one Krassin proposes to organise in London.
There are indications that a mysterious deal in steel is being attempted behind Krassin&apos;s back. The parties interested say in a letter that Krassiu must be bombarded with &quot;made up offers or tenders for &quot; steel from various firms in different quantities at increased prices, &quot; say at the rate of 20 per cent, to 15 per cent, more than my prices &quot;  a precious commentary on Bolshevik commercial methods.Olaf Aschberg, Director of the Svenska Ekonomiaktiebolaget, has set out for Russia. He has been carrying on gold and valuta transactions with the Bolsheviks, with whom he has also been in touch over the branch of the Svenska in Stockholm which has been bought by the Bolsheviks. It is apparently proposed to open a branch of the &quot; Svenska &quot; in Paris. Difficulties in obtaining permis de sejour there for Russian subjects may be overcome when the branch starts functioning, and there is proof that the execution of a contract between French producers and Russian buyers requires the co-operation of Russian subjects.To celebrate the anniversary of the signing of the Trade Agreement between SAveden and Soviet Russia, the Bolsheviks gave a dinner at the best and most expensive restaurant in Stockholm, hiring the most expensive suite of rooms for the occasion.Dealings in Russian Gold.Various American concerns are seeking to acquire from the Swedish banks gold with the Swedish stamp. For instance, early in April the Svenska Haudelsbanken was asked by Ladenburg, Thalman &amp; Co., of New York, that Russian gold received from Reval should be turned into Swedish bar gold and held to their account, and whether such gold was in danger of being attached. The Svenska Handelsbanken expressed their willingness to arrange, through the Royal Mint, for the roubles to be melted. They did not consider that there was present danger of confiscation by the Swedish Government, but they could take no respon-sibility for future restrictions, nor could they vouch for the purity of the gold coins.The melting of Russian gold is said to have been proceeding in Sweden since May 1920. Last year some 19 tons were melted, of which about 3Jj tons were minted. 70 tons of gold, equal to about 71,000,000 gold roubles, are reported to have been melted and restamped. this year. In addition, 200,000,000 kroner worth of gold, the balance of 600,000,000 kroner worth deposited during 1920, stood to Bolshevik credit in Swedish banks at the beginning of this year, against orders placed in Sweden. This amount has probably since been supplemented. &apos; Much of the imported gold is believed to be impure.Miscellaneous.Count Wrangel has sharply called the attention of Moscow to the fact that greater part of the telegrams sent to Stockholm by the Swedish General Export Company&apos;s Moscow delegation have come to Kerjentseffs address. He asks for the &quot; immediate abrogation of this arbitrary proceeding.&quot;A law has been passed reducing very considerably the penalties for defamation of the principal members of the Swedish Royal family, foreign rulers present in Sweden, or foreign envoys.The Swedish delegates to the Moscow Congress of the Third International include Strom, Hoglund, and Bergegren. Moscow had previously reported that the Swedish Government had refused to permit, the departure of the latter.O AS 8868 0
DENMARK.Communism.The Danish extremists, who have been organised in the Danish Communist Party (section of the Third International) and in &quot; Fagoppositionens Sammenslutning &quot; (section of the Red professional International) have federated on the lines of the Third International. They have fused their individual daily papers, &quot; Arbejdet&quot; and &quot; Solidaritet &quot; into one called &quot; Arhejder-Bladet.&quot; The Communist, Johannes Ervig, will edit this paper, and the Syndicalist, Christian Christensen, will sub-edit it.Aage Jorgensen and Axel Jensen, secretary of the Communist Party of Denmark, have recently been to Russia oh an unknown errand.. Kerjeutseff, the Soviet emissary in Stockholm, is&quot; reported to have asked the Danish Communist Party to consider the possibility of the Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish Communists preparing a plan for the systematical production of propaganda literature in the Scandinavian countries and its distribution to various other countries. This literature could be printed in English, French, and German.Miscellaneous.The Agricultural Workers&apos; Trade Union has declared a strike over a reduction of wages ; 10,000 members are involved.The Danish Police have at length traced the source of the forged notes of the Rigsbank which have been circulating in great numbers. The German police have arrested in Berlin an ex-bank clerk, a member of the staff of the &quot; Rote Fahne,&quot; who has confessed to a part in the forgeries. He confessed that the object of the forgeries was political  to destroy the credit of a capitalist country.3. CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.4 HOLLAND.Relations with Russia.A Prague newspaper is responsible for a report that Holland is trying to get into touch with Russia, and, helped by branches of the firm Helexo at Reval, Danzig and Helsingfors, is energetically organising business relations. A Dutch-Baltic Commercial Corporation, &quot; Nebal,&quot; has been formed at Amsterdam from 50 of the biggest Dutch&apos;factories ; it will found branches in Finland, Esthonia and Latvia for the furtherance of Trade with Russia.The Sickness of the Labour Movement.Independent Trade Unionism in Holland has fallen upon, evil days. The number of members of the National Workers&apos; Secretariat is constantly diminishing while the Christian Neutral Trades Unions grow in strength. Other indications of sickness are the, difficulty that the Workers&apos; Press finds in remaining alive, the feebleness of the co-operatives, the failure of one-day strikes against reactionary, laws, and the hopeless division of the working classes, most ,of whom Jiaye any; thing but revolutionary ideas. The only result of revolutionary talk has been a strengthening of reaction.
436Miscellaneous.May Day demonstrations were large but orderly, and speeches ran upon the usual lines of salvation through socialism and a vague inter-nationalism.The Third International Free Trade Congress will be held in Amsterdam next September.The quarrels between Wynkoop and Van Leuven have ended in the latter losing his post as sub-editor of the &quot; Tribune.&quot; Here Ceton, the editor, has replaced Van Leuven in writing economic articles. Van Leuven, who remains in the Communist camp, where he has joined the Luteraan, Gorter, &amp;c, party is probably Wynkoop&apos;s most bitter and influential enemy.The Amsterdam International has endorsed the opposition of the bureau of the Federation to the attempts of the Moscow International to divide the working classes, and has reaffirmed the previous decision that every organisation which affiliates itself to Moscow places itself outside the Amsterdam International.GERMANY. Echoes of the Easter Rising.Brass and Kurt Geyer are said to have visited Moscow during March on behalf of the moderates of the United Communist Party, in order to persuade the Third International to replace the &quot;Putsch&quot; policy by large scale propaganda. Koenen, the Halle Communist leader, who was also in Moscow, recommended the continuance of militant methods. Shortly before the outbreak, Dittmann and Crispien are said to have promised the support of the Independents if the revolutionary action were taken at a suitable moment. The Independents, however, would seem never to regard the moment as opportune.Notwithstanding their disappointments, the Central Committee of the party resolved early in April to continue &quot; Putsch &quot; tactics, and appointed Otto, who is identical with the Hungarian Captain Steinbrueck, to reorganise the Red Army and increase its mobility. Doubt as to the value of the Red Army would appear, nevertheless, to be prevalent. Small groups of entirely trustworthy people are more favoured; it is recognised that the active participation of the agricultural labourers must be obtained, and that committees of&apos; action must be formed in both the Communistic parties. *Reports of Russian complicity in the rising continue. The Inde-pendent Socialists are said to have proof of Kopp&apos;s generous financial support of the communists and of his ^personal relations with Max Holz. Kopp was the means of a meeting between Hok and Phillips Price, Berlin correspondent of the &quot;Daily Herald.&quot; Kopp has meanwhile expressed bis belief that Klara iZetkin will soon reappear in the front tank of the party, as she has recognised her mistake. Kopp himself denies any personal connection with the German Communist Party. The new leaders^ he says, are distinctly more inclined to the Left than the former leaders, ,and they approved of the rising. The Executive Com-mittee of the Third International will pronounce on the reason of the failure. The -Executive Committee knew that conflicts such as that now raging would arise.Kopp&apos;s Organisation on the Rising.In a pessimistic report to Moscow, Sabludowslri, of the Political Department of Kopp&apos;s office, frankly, admits the Communist debacle, and talks of &apos;the entire disintegration of the German Communists and the02
hopelessness of moving German workers to any active measure. There is a swing to the Right, and there can be no question of a revolution.Kopp&apos;s organisation as a whole is of opinion that the putsch damaged tho International Communist movement through splitting the party in Germany. A restoration of the old regime is viewed as possible through evolutionary processes working on tho German liking for a strong Government. The whole upheaval has tended to the strengthening of the Right, with the Orgesch at its head. The Orgesch, indeed, has achieved its object of disorganising the workers&apos; movement.Moscow and the German Communists.The result of the present disputes is foreshadowed in Kopp&apos;s statement that at the forthcoming Congress of the Third International it will be decided that there is to be only ono Communist Party in Germany  the V.K.P.D., or United Communist Party. The K.A.P.D. (Communist Labour Party) will be excluded from the Third International if it does not rid itself of Nationalist, Syndicalist, and Anarchist elements. Members of the K.A.P.D. known to have sound ideas will be encouraged to join the V.K.P.D.These are the tactics suggested by Zinovieff and Radek to the Secretariat of the Third International. Retorting on these statements, Ruble, the head of the K.A.P.D., has stated that his party are purely Communist, but that they do not regard Communism in the same light as the V.K.P.D. &quot; As we are fully convinced that we alone are the bearers of true Communism, we will never agree to amalgamate with the United Communist Party unless they should wish to come over to us.&quot; Riihle added that they were sending delegates to Moscow to clear up matters. If Moscow paid no attention to their explanations they intended to withdraw at once from the Third International, but in their own interests they would continue working for the proletariat and world revolution. In case they got the power in their hands they would not delay in cancelling the Versailles Treaty and they would entrust the defence of their rights to a Red proletariat army. The deputation of the K.A.P.D. is to plead that the United Party is a failure and that the Workers should be the sole party in Germany representing the Third International. It bases its case on the failure of the March riots, the lack of discipline in the V.K.A.D. and its predilections for consti-tutional action, whereas the K.A.P.D. is the great enemy of the bourgeoisie and favours a ceaseless civil war against it.German Communists greatly disapprove the recent modifications of Soviet internal policy, foreseeing continued concessions and compromises.Internal Affairs of the Communists.Signs of disintegration are apparent in the Communist Party. Most of the older members, who went over last summer from the Independent Socialist Party, are returning to their old love. The agitators are said to have received instructions to propagate the idea that the last putsch was caused by provocatory measures taken by the reactionary parties.The intestine struggles in the V.K.P.D. are emphasised by the split in the party representation in the Reichstag. Seventeen members have sided with Levi; the minority of five, which includes the present chairman, retain their allegiance to the Central Executive of the Party. Meanwhile, the Executive Committee of the Third International has approved the expulsion of Levi, and has reserved judgment as to the advisability or otherwise of the &quot; March action.&quot; All material is ,to be forwarded, so that the whole question can be judged at the coming congress of the Third International.   There is little doubt that the
extraordinary party meeting which is shortly to be held will also vote against Levi. The members of the party are influenced by the continuance of the Russian subsidy, without which the Communist organisation could not exist.Levi himself is said to intend forming a new Right Communist group. His success is doubtful, as the German workers are beginning to realise the evils of continual splits, and the mood of the Communist rank and file would appear to be still extremely radical. So much under the influence of the aggregressive Left Wing are party meetings in Berlin, that opponents are hardly able to speak. There is an under-current of support for Levi; for instance, the Bavarian Communist Party is said to back Levi to a man, and to agree with everything he has stated in his pamphlet. It is also stated that the changes&apos; in the leaders smell too much of the dictation of Moscow to meet with over much favour from the rank and file. With them such names as Zetkin and Levi mean a good deal. The United Communists of Cologne have invited Zetkin to that city and favour a general members&apos; meeting to clear up questions of internal management.The Jewish Communists.In preparation for the Juvenile Communists World Congress to be held at the end of June a preliminary conference of delegates was held in Germany during April, starting at Jena and continuing in Berlin. About 80 delegates, representing all countries except Russia and Spain, attended the conference. The doctrine of the revolutionary offensive was expounded, and the conference agreed that continual action, shared in by all juvenile organisations, was the main necessity. Ideas and organisation are to be focussed on civil war, and the Juvenile Com-munists are to remain the advanced troops. The Moscow Congress will have to settle the field of work, and the various problems connected with it. The Juvenile Communists have meanwhile held a propaganda week, which was considered a success. The working children of the world are to be asked to hold an international Communist Children^ Week in June. The German police are carefully watching the existent children&apos;s groups.These groups appear to correspond to the Socialist Sunday Schools in England. They have for aim to educate the proletarian school children in Communists ideas and to prepare them for tne struggle of the proletariat. Social care is indicated, but seems to be of secondary importance. Children of Communists form the nucleus of the movement; they are to carry the conflict into the schools, and to act as &quot; cells &quot; in other existing proletarian children&apos;s groups. The movement has a fortnightly organ called &quot; Der Junge Genosse.&quot; A national congress has approved the creation of Communist Children&apos;s Groups which shall rally proletarian children under Communist leadership, awake class consciousness, educate the children in proletarian solidarity and in the &quot; struggle of the masses against the exploiter.&quot;Extremist Movements. Miscellaneous.It is reported that the Independent Socialist Party have decided to organise their own defensive corps and courier service. Agents in the Reichswehr and Arbeiterwehr are to secure the necessary arms. An International Congress of representatives of the Third International is shortly to be held in Berlin with the object of regulating and co-ordinating the work of parties adhering to the International. The Communists would appear to attach great importance to this Congress.
Communist propaganda is again reported to be proceeding among the British, French and Belgian troops of occupation. Pamphlets are secretly distributed ; in several regiments Communist &quot;cells&quot; exist. At Dusseldorf and Duisberg, the soldiers are in touch with revolutionists.Daiimig and Klara Zetkin are alleged to&apos; have met some leaders of the French Communists at Zurich on April 22nd, with a view to organising troubles in the Ruhr, if and when  an Allied occupation should take place. Close co-operation between German and French Communists was agreed upon.The &quot; Orgesch &quot; leaders are said to be busy with a plan for intro-ducing members of the Orgesch into the&apos; Red Army on the &quot; cell&quot; principle, thus transforming the army into an instrument of German policy. . An attack on Poland and a sudden transformation of the Red Army, as it approaches the German frontier, into a Russian national army with a pro-German orientation, are obscurely foreshadowed, together with a simultaneous coup in Moscow and the establishment of a pro-German government. The Communists have founded a special organisation of the metal workers. The Agricultural Workers&apos; Union, at present in the hands of the Right Socialists, has split, and a &quot; Free Land Workers&apos; Union&quot; has been formed from the Radical group. Neither the United Communists nor the Independent Socialists seem to welcome the union as new adherents.Affairs of the Soviet Delegation.Kopp left Berlin for Moscow on May 13th. It is report 3d that Count Obolenski, a member of the Soviet Peace Delegation at Riga and Dorpat, will succeed him, and that the Berlin Mission has been divided into two distinct political and commercial departments, the latter under the Bulgarian Stomoniakoff. Reich is reported to have been appointed to the Soviet Delegation in Kovno.The Berlin Delegation has been warned not to he come involved in Third International activities.Early in April Kopp informed Karakhan that Frise proved to be a very good worker though not efficient enough for the special functions Zinovieff expected him to carry out. With the death of Lange (head of the Bolshevik Propaganda and Intelligence Service in Germany) &quot; opportunism &quot; had ceased. In regard to questions which were expected and for which Kopp was preparing replies, Karakhan was asked to see that the statements of his Germans did not differ from Kopp&apos;s, a thing which might harm the Berlin representation. Before his departure Kopp had urgently requested Karakhan for a revision of all matters concerning Soviet representation in Germany. It would appear that what amounts to a court of inquiry into Kopp&apos;s activities is being held. Reliable information states that one of the matters being investigated is the disposal by Kopp of 70,000,000 marks which he withdrew from the Deutsche Bank at the end of February and did not account for.Krestinsky (People&apos;s Commissary for Finance) and Ryesnikov, have been in Berlin, with instructions to inspect the departments concerned with the exchange of Russian currency in Germany. There are unsavoury allegations of profiteering in wbieh Alexandrovsky is said, to have played the chief part, and in which the Soviet financial agents in Berlin have shared. .   .Relations with Russia.It is reported that Moscow is flattering the Nationalist heart of Germany by planning a great Pan-German-speaking Soviet controlling all Central European industry under the German Communist Party
The so-called deals between the German heavy industrials and Russia are, however, said to bo falling through, owing to absence of guarantee for payment. No real business has been done with Lomonosoff and the Soviet trade representatives. Stinnes&apos; deals are vague ; his name is often used to give an impression of substance to shadowy schemes.Krestinsky, head of the Russian Commissariat for Finance, is reported to be negotiating through the Swedish Bank, Olaf Aschbcrg, with tho Bleichroder Bank and a financial group in Frankfort, for a loan of 400,000,000 German marks, to be used solely to cover payments of orders placed by the Soviet Government in Germany. The Soviet is prepared to deposit gold in Germany or Sweden as a guarantee. The Commissariat for Foreign Trade has made various offers of. goods, notably furs and timber, to various German firms.The appointment of the ex-Secretary of State, Dr. August Miiller, as German Charge dAffaires in Russia, is reported to be pending. Dr. Midler is a Majority Socialist.German Workers and the British Miners.German miners and workmen generally have been keenly interested in the labour troubles in England. It is reported that a negative reply was received from England to the German Miners&apos; Associations&apos; question whether the British miners wanted help in any way. As a measure of practical sympathy, alleging instructions from their Union in Berlin, dock labourers at the Weser ports in many cases refused to load bunker coal, into British ships arriving with insufficient bunkers for the return voyage to the United Kingdom. The Executives of the German Transport Workers also resolved not to handle coal for direct shipment to England and to strike in case such shipments are attempted. These resolutions seem to have remained resolutions only. As for their own affairs, German mine owners and the men&apos;s leaders are still divided on the question of wages and extra shifts. The only agreement that has really been reached is that the Union leaders will submit the owners&apos; proposal to the members of the Unions themselves, though the miners will probably refuse them at once. It is suggested that a general strike in Germany would so cripple the Unions financially as to render them non-effective for some time.The Activities of Hugo Stinnes.Thanks to the revelations of an enemy, the Czecho-Slovak Govern-ment is said to have been informed of the mission of M. Schultess, the Manager of the Press Telegraph, Zurich, charged on behalf of Stinnes with founding a Press Bureau in Prague. M. Schultess was asked to leave the country the day after his arrival in Prague. Stinnes is said to be working for an interest in the Danube Navigation Company, having heard that the English owners do not wish to commit themselves deeply. He is in close communication with all Balkan countries, paying special attention to the Transylvanian metal industry. Dr. Damm, an ex-journalist, heads Stinnes&apos; large organisation in Vienna. Stinnes&apos; activities extend to the Argentine, where he directs the operations of the Cia. Thysson, Ltd., a powerful German syndicate in Buenos Aires.Various Russian financiers in Germany are said to have tried to obtain financial support from Stinnes for the KrouVtadt risingl He refused, how-eyer, to have anything io &quot;do with it. The rumours that Stinnes is trying to obtain concessions in Russia are reported to be quite true. He is making sure of any concessions he may obtain, even in case of the fall of the present Government.
The real reason for the non re-election of Hugo Stinncs as a director of tho Hamburg-America Line is said to be the desire of the Lino to get on comparatively friendly terms with England and America, and eventually with France.Oriental Intrigues.It has been reported that S.N. Kar, now in America, has been invited to go to Stockholm or Berlin. In Berlin he would most likely replace Dutt as head of the Indian Executive Committee. Sheikh Shawish is said to have formed in Berlin a secret Egyptian club, and to bo publishing a small propaganda paper with funds raised from Egyptians in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. He has asked Kopp to discover whether any Moscow courier can be charged with smuggling the papers into Egypt.Miscellaneous.Labour Day went over peacefully throughout Germany. The prevalent depression of the Communists was reflected in the dullness of their speeches ; the S.P.D. confined themselves mainly to tirades against the Sanctions.Though Dr. Parvus no longer holds an official position in the Social Democratic Party, his influence on party decisions remains considerable and his advice is often sought, especially by Scheidemann and the chairman of the Party, Otto Wels. He may indeed be considered the adviser of the party leaders in knotty ecouomic0questions, especially in the reparation question.Dr. Quidde, Chairman of the German Peace Society, has intimated that there is no increase in pacifism, though the membership of the pacifist organisations has increased.   Rather is nationalism on the rise.A strong anti-Semitic feeling is reported to be universal among the supporters of order in Germany. The Germans are convinced that labour unrest, not only in Russia, but throughout the world, is caused by an international Jewish movement.Hering, alias Ferry, the instigator of the attempt to blow up the Victory Column, has been sentenced to eight years&apos; penal servitude. It is a curious fact that Hering was discovered through counsel for the accused Communists, who believed him to be an agent provocateur used by the police. It is obvious, however, that he is an agent of the Moscow extremists.A group of members of the neAV Fourth International are credited with the intention of establishing a special newspaper in Berlin, which will agitate against the Treaty of Versailles and for a settlement of the reparations question in accordance with its own ideas. They mean to start a campaign in the Socialist press throughout the world to take the reconstruction of the devastated areas out of the hands of French capitalists.SWITZERLAND.Communism.May Day passed over quietly. In Zurich Platten made an inflamma-tory speech, extolling Russia as the banner bearer of freedom a remark which discovered more sense of humour in the listeners than in the speakers. A new development was the presence of children in the procession, but there was an entire absence of uniformed municipal and railway employees.
439A number of Communist agents are said to be in Switzerland, . describing themselves as employed by the Soviet Government, but iu reality financed solely from German funds. They often pass under Russian names, though their real German names are known. The German authorities seem to be supporting at present, in the hope of drawing political profit from it, a sort of &quot; neo-Communism &quot; in Switzer-laud. One Reichman, of Hamburg, an agent for many years of German heavy industry, and as such the subsidiser of several Austrian news-papers, is known recently to have brought into Switzerland large sums of money for revolutionary propaganda and to have been in constant touch with Swiss extremists. His contributions include one of over 100,000 francs to &quot; L&apos;Avant Garde.&quot;An active foundation of Communist &quot;germ cells&quot; in the Swiss Alpine Club is reported. The propaganda made by the cells, especially in the sections of Zurich and Berne, has greatly alarmed the Central Committee of the Club.A secret meeting of Communists held towards the end of April at Zurich discussed the germ cell system, but appears to have reached no practical decision. The Federation of Metal workers was said to be in a difficult position, and the railwaymen Avere said to be disunited. These people have decided not to send a representative to Moscow as if he was dismissed they could not support him financially. Platten was reported to be secretary of the Communist Party for Eastern switzerland; Humbert-Droz for Western switzerland and Bobst for Soleure, Berne and Argovie.A Congress of the SavIss Young Communists Avas held at Zurich in the middle of May. It Avas busy chiefly with the new propaganda to be carried out in collaboration with the Communist Party and the extremist Trades Unions. France will need to study the activities which are to be developed in switzerland. Anti-militarist propaganda is to be much strengthened ; Germans will represent the organisation of their country, and Avill introduce a Franco-German anti-militarist plan of action ; and Moscoav will direct the general international anti-militarist move-ment.The Bolshevik Commercial Mission.The Bolshevik Commercial Mission in Berne, which is tolerated but not officially recognised by the Federal Government, is located at the business premises of the Soviet Commercial delegate, one D. E. Scher-maun, a Russian- Jew, naturalized Swiss, the owner  of a boot store in Berne. Schermann appears to do a large business Avith Russia ; his firm has branches at Baku, Tiflis and Batum. Schermann&apos;s son Leon has been five times to the Caucasus, and there is reason to believe that the Schermann organisation in switzerland is a propaganda office which does not operate there, but acts as intermediary for propaganda in the East, Avorking under cover of exports to Eastern countries. The Bolshevik delegates in the Caucasus receive the goods despatched. The Mission in switzerland is composed of five men, formally bound not to undertake propaganda in Switzerland but possibly using intermediaries for the purpose. There are no relations between D. R. Schermann and Platten, who is, hoAvever, in close touch with Leon Schermann.Bagotzky, the Soviet Red Cross Delegate in Berne has been instructed to continue the despatch of clothes, &amp;c, for the Red Army. These transactions are carried out by Schermann&apos;s &quot; Commercial Mission,&quot; Avhich is reported to be sending large quantities of goods to the Bolshevik Army.
Irish propaganda in Switzerland, which has hitherto been done by isolated persons directed individually from Paris, is now to bo centralised and co-ordinated. Wohlhauscr, of Fribourg, president of the switzerland^s Press Office for Irish news, presided at a conference held with this object at Olten at tho beginning of May. A provisional committee was formed, which drew up a report to Thomas 0&apos;Kelly in Paris. Paris was asked to send a delegate for the immediate establishment of a Swiss Committee and the better organisation of propaganda. Funds were also asked for. Paris appears to have already agreed to the proposal in principle, and to have suggested that similar centres, working on similar lines, might be formed in Holland and Sweden. An extensive propaganda campaign was discussed.In Fribourg itself, where many priests of various nationalities are engaged in it, Sinn Fein propaganda is active. For instance, a French priest recently delivered several intensely anti-British lectures. This propaganda has not hitherto been neutralised ; it has worked upon anti-Protestant as well as anti-British predjudices, and has a deep anti-British influence upon the young clerics trained at Fribourg and sent thence all over the world. Counter measures are now being taken.. Sinn Fein activities extend to correspondence with Sinn Fein leaders in Ireland. It is to be noted that most of the present Sinn Fein propagandists were pro-German propagandists during the war.The Geneva Women&apos;s League appears to be active among Protestants, in working circles, &amp;c. There are suspicions that the Sinn Fein propa-ganda Bureau at Fribourg has subsidised this League.Miscellaneous.Hugo Stinnes is said to have made offers of purchase to the National Zeitung of Basle, the Zuricher Post of Zurich, La Suisse of Geneva, and La Tribune de Lausanne at Lausanne. The Suisse and Tribune have refused to deal; the attitude of the German papers is not yet known.The recent Congress of the International Federation of Transport Workers disclosed far more national than international feeling. It was admitted that the Federation was not yet strong enough.to refuse;the transport of troops. Moreover, it suffers from the violent quarrels between the Communists and the Socialists of the Amsterdam International to which it belongs.AUSTRIAInternal Affairs of the Communist Party.The situation produced in the Communist Party by the expulsion of Paul Levi in Germany, shows signs of clarifying. The Viennese Party Secretariat has inquired of Berlin whether party decisions for Berlin are to apply automatically to Austria, and whether Austria is to receive special instructions or to take her own line. This inquiry may. have caused the. German Party&apos;s decision to hold a secret iuquiry, at which all members, secretaries, and officials of the Austrian Communist Party are to state honestly their opinions of Levi&apos;s views. The Right Wing of the Austrian party harbours many strong supporters of Levi, and the formation of a party which will secede, taking the party funds, is being attempted. This new party is opposed to terror, and is to coalesce with the Left Wing of the Austrian&apos; Socialist Party, which is kind
towards the Levites. Money has so far been the difficulty, since the would-be secessionists wish to bring a rich dowry to their new partners, and the Left Wing Communists are for their part determined to stick to the cash. These zealots are tightening discipline and in every way combating the Levites. In short, there is all the matter for a pretty schism.The Styrian Communists, who are among the most radical in Austria, have meanwhile, demanded the transfer to Graz of the seat of the Austrian section of the United Communist Party. They threaten to refuse obedience to the leaders, and to communicate direct with Moscow if the party funds cannot otherwise be saved. Most of the Soldatenriite and the Trades Union of the Wehrmacht adhere to the Left. Tomaiin leans to the Left, but he is opposed to violence, and his attitude is uncertain ; Frey&apos;s policy of hunting with the hounds and. running with the hare is losing him followers.It was reported in April that preparations for the Communist &quot; Wirkliche Tat&quot; included the conduct of all money arrangements in marks, Austria being treated, for this purpose, as one with Germany. Czech soldiers are not considered dangerous, as arrangements are beiug made for simultaneous action in German Bohemia. In Slovakia, which is deemed the best organized Communist country, simultaneous risings are also expected. A credit of 3,000,000 marks has been opened in Berlin for propaganda in Vienna. Frey is suspected, and is to be arraigned before his party for investigation.A Miscellany of Communism.A protest by the Chancellor, Dr. Mayr, has forced Bronski to give up his plan of fetching the German Communist Lange to act as his secretary in Vienna.The Austrian Anarchists have declared their adhesion to the newly founded Anarchist-Communist Brotherhood. Their activities are strongly anti-militarist, but they repudiate any violence.The Communist headquarters in Vienna for &quot;direct liaison with Lenin is in Vienna IX., under the name of Steinmann Engineering Co., Ltd. This office issued certain special orders from Moscow to the highest party officials only, under the title of &quot; Special Summary,&quot; edited by the former Austrian Count Schaffgotsch, who passes under the alias of Hans Volker.Communism in the Wehrmacht is reported to have been showing itself rather through the participation of Communist soldiers in working class activities than through propaganda in the barracks.Since the abortive visit of ex-Kaiser Karl to Hungary, small bodies of Communistic Terror troops are being organised in Vienna, with the intention of breaking up reactionary meeting places and of preventing reactionary reunions from being held.There is reported to be a nest of Hungarian Communists in the Belvederehof, Vienna. The Communists lodging here are in communica-tion both with Bronski and with their agents in Hungary. They appear to snruggle secret documents concealed in the binding of books.The Union of ox-^arriors (workmen and landless peasants) of Austria is a.society which aims at collecting under Communist leader-ship all proletarian elements which served in the war. It has succeeded an. abortive ^attempt to organise ,Socialis,t or Communist soldiers in Austria on the lines of Barbusse&apos;s proposed system. The Union ,dpes little political work, but its activity lias increased of late, and ,.the Communists belieye i,t would help them should a cftlib^given for.action on a gre.at jseaje.
May Day Demonstrations.May Day witnessed an imposing Social Democratic demonstration in Vienna, joined in by 250,000 persons. In all towns tlioro were pro-cessious, notable for tho presence of children and soldiers. The only disturbance occurred in Vienna, where Communists, holding an indepen-dent meeting, created some disorder. Some windows of the Hungarian Legation were broken. The Communist leaders have recently called for the exercise of vigour and the end of passivity. As a result of the disorder Tomann, the Communist leader, was informed that at the first sign of trouble every foreign Communist in Vienna would be locked up as a preliminary to deportation. The most troublesome element in Vienna consists of Hungarian refuges, and the threat was effective.Stinnes and Austrian Industry.Hugo Stinnes has registered in Vienna the &quot; Hugo Stinues Limited Liability Co.&quot; (capital 1,200,000 kr.) for trade in agricultural products, working mines, setting up furnaces, and for dealing in the manufacture of chemical and electro-chemical articles. The undertaking is purposely modest, in order not to alarm xlustrian opinion, which has been rendered decidedly nervous by Stinnes&apos; activities. Heterogeneous party organs find themselves united in opposition to Stinnes. He is reproached with fanning and financing the Anschluss movement in Tyrol and with trying to prevent Austria from exporting to Germany. Stinnes&apos; efforts to buy the Vienna and Budapest press have been a comparative failure.Miscellaneous.The next International Congress of Transport Workers will be held in the autumn of 1922 in Vienna.Trebitsch Lincoln has been acquitted by the Vienna Central Criminal Court on a charge of treason and forgery. It is reported that he will sail for the United States.Many members of the Vienna Chamber of Commerce are said to be agitating for an official commercial treaty with Russia. Negotiations with Bronski-Warschawski may shortly begin.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA. The Communists&apos; Policy.The Third International is said to regard Czecho-Slovakia as an artificial structure founded on imperialistic treaties and incapable of long duration. The proletariat of the country must arrange its policy accordingly, envisaging ultimate absorption by Hungary and Austria.The Communist were reported at the end of April to have decided upon a policy of moderation as their best course under the present unfavourable conditions. Only in Slovakia is the movement at present dangerous. Here, where bad conditions favour discontent, Moscow has centred its attentions and is carrying on an active propaganda with Magyar agents paid partly from Moscow and partly from Budapest. Vienna is also influencing the movement to some extent. The centres of the organisation are at Bratislava, Ruzomberk and Kosice that at Ruzomberk is said to number 78,000 members. The Communist chief in Slovakia in Dr. Anton Guth, former Magyar Commissary for Health, who lives in Bratislava. He directs the Communist Members of Parlia-ment; he organised the last strike and is now engineering a new one.
The Communist Congress.Some time before the holding of the Whitsuntide Communist Congress Lenin and Trotsky were said to favour Dr. Smeral&apos;s plea that he should retain the leadership of an autonomous Communist party in Czeoho-Slovakia. Zinovieff opposed it, wishing to establish a party controlled by trusted Hungarian emigrants and entirely dependent on Moscow a policy also favoursed by Gillerson. Smeral had managed to secure the refusal of an offer of substantial financial help made Rakoczy to the Kladno Com-munists on condition that they organised according to his directions and under his leadership.^ Meanwhile the meetings preliminary to the Congress were devoted to smoothing the path to membership of&apos; the Third International. Trouble was evidently anticipated from the Trades Unions, who by no means favoured action leading to disunion or disruption. Thus, the German railway employees of Czecho-Slovakia had resolved that every member who, on the ground of the trades workers movement, adopted the resolutions and suggestions of the Third International, infringed the rules of the Workers&apos; Union, and placed himself outside its provisions.The Social Democrat Left was itself divided into two groups one of Marxists, calling themselves the &quot; Uncompromising &quot; Social Democrats, but independent of Moscow ; the other of Communists seeking to pledge the party to the Third International. This group wished to form a single party with the German and Magyar Communists, headed by Kreibich. Dr. Smeral seemed to hover unattached between the two wings.The Congress resulted in the submission to Moscow of the old Left Wing of the Czech Social Democrats, which now becomes the Czech Communist Party. The new Party is officially said to have over 400,000 members, over 2,000 local branches, and to be the most powerful Labour organisation in Czecho-Slovakia. The Congress voted down a resolution demanding that the Executive should continue the previous policy of Smeral, and gave a mandate for more radical tactics. SmeraPs group succeeded, however, in electing the majority of its candidates to the new Executive. The new party is, meanwhile, faced with an internal struggle. It is suggested that the division in the party is due to the bribing of Smeral by the Government.Teska, leader of the Communists in the Chamber, Skatula, the secretary of the party, and the editor of the Communist daily paper &quot; Rude Prave,&quot; have seceded from the newly formed Party.Communist Activities.The Congress of Czech Women of the Left, uniting 182 organisations, has unanimously decided to adhere to the Third International.Preparations are being made for the foundation of an international Communist workmen&apos;s party. The Communist Juvenile Association, the energising body in Czecho-Slovakian Communism, has taken the initiative.Agitation by German Communists continues. In April the publication of four new papers was started in Reichenberg, one of them; the &quot; Volksblatt,&quot; professing to be the organ of the Communist Party in Czecho-Slovakia.In the Brunn-Dux district of Bohemia the Communists are making great efforts to crush the three Miners&apos; Unions and to form a single union, without distinction of nationality, controlled by themselves.
The Position o! the National Socialists.The National Socialists are talking of a congress for the summer. This party is seriously divided, the stronger body following a programme of moderate social reform, the weaker, mostly composed of the Czech Anarchist group under Dr. Vrbensky^ standing for international socialism, shot with communistic tendencies. The Vrbensky group was making ready in April to unite with the Social Democrats; the remainder will probably adopt a programme midway between the Socialist and bourgeois blocks.Miscellaneous.The Miners&apos; Federation of Czecho-Slovakia is reported to have proclaimed its solidarity with the British miners and its readiness to support any active measures proposed by the Miners&apos; International Federation.Mostovehko, who had first been appointed to Riga, has been placed in charge of the Trade Delegation in Czecho-Slovakia, in place of Araloff, a senior staff officer of the Red Army.The Government has promised its patronage to the Esperanto Congress which opans in Prague on July 31st. It is considered likely that leading international Communists will attend the Congress and use it as cover for secret communications.A Bill prepared by the Ministry of Social Welfare seeks to make binding collective agreements between workmen and employees. A close co-operation with the State works office, which will keep a register of all agreements entered into, is indicated. These agreements will be public documents, and must be concluded for at least three months. Four specialised Arbitration Commissions are proposed to deal with disputes.HUNGARY.All recent Hungarian passports are said to have been altered by the substitution of the words &quot;Kingdom of Hungary&quot; for &quot;Hungarian Republic.&quot;Hugo Stinnes is reported to be seeking to acquire the majority of the shares of some of the joint stock companies prominent in the Hungarian iron industry, including the Rimamurany mines and the machine factories of Worner, Schlickj and Ganz.The Hungarian Government and the Soviet are reported to have agreed that all Hungarian Commissaries sentenced to death and those sentenced to more than 10 years&apos; imprisonment will tfe handed Over to Russian authorities for repatriation in exchange for Hungarian officers interned in Russia, at the rate of six Hungarian officers for each commissary.4. RUSSIA AND THE BORDER STATES, RUSSIA.Social and Economic.Various reports tend to emphasise the extent and urgency of the food crisis. Rations in Petrograd have sunk below subsistence level; in fact, a Helsingfors message on May l-2th reported that for etght days the population of Petrograd had been without bread rations. Tt is difficult to see how the crisis is to be met.  The total amount of cereals, ihclucfing
44fodder and Governmental stores, is put at 30,000,000 poods actually it is less ; and the Soviet, with its treasury practically empty, has to make the purchase of vast quantities of food abroad.   The crisis can no longer be explained away by references to a state of war, and the rulers are recognising, both implicitly and explicitly, that the passive resistance of the peasants to Communism is tho rock on which their experiment has split.  There is no hope of the revival of Russian industry under present conditions of bureaucratic folly, which deprives the management of com-mand over a single element labour, material, or money.    Tile raw&apos; materials, according to Bolshevik admissions, belong to tho Economic Council; the labour is commanded by the Commissariat of Work; the transport is entirely in the hands of the local Soviet; and the money to pay,wages has to be obtained from trade unions filled with the bureau-cratic spirit far in advance of the rest of the bureaucratic machine and killing every initiative.The anxiety of the Soviet is reflected in numerous proclamations. One orders village nuclei, Soviet and Collective farms to show in practice how the consequences of drought can be combated, and prescribes various measures against it. A circular to Government Sowing Committees asks for reports as to the work done in connection with the early ploughing campaign; the importance of which is insisted upon. Early ploughing should be compulsory where one-third of the inhabitants of a village insist upon it&apos;, but their insistence should not be obtained by threats. All force and all strength are called for in connection with the first organised sowing campaign another illustration of the Soviet dread of impending famine.Moscow also announces that there must be no conference or congress of peasants in the governments where the harvest has failed which does not discuss the question of organising public dining rooms.There are ominous reports that the plague has crossed the Urals from Siberia arid made its appearance in the Ufa province. The dirty and famished population is eminently susceptible to infectious diseases. To the insanitary conditions must be added the circumstance that Russian towns, large and small, are now overrun by millions of rats.Cholera is spreading -in South Eastern Russia. The situation is particularly serious in the Donetz basin.Official figures of the Economic Council show that the productiveness of the Russian workman has declined to 8 per cent, of his capacity in normal times. The percentage of the railwaymen is a little higher. These men are said to be very anti-Soviet, and to possess a secret organi-sation agitating against the dictatorship of the Communist party;The Evolution of Soviet Policy.In a final analysis three motives appear to underlie the new economic policy firstly by means of promises to stimulate the peasants to greater production ; secondly by means of increased production to feed the &quot;towns and thus keep the workmen quieter, and thirdly by means of the Co-operatives to keep &quot;Free Trade&quot; in Soviet hands. Great efforts are being made to produce and distribute farm implements. The opposition is not yet making itself outwardly felt, but profound discords-chiefly on the question of concessions to foreigners lie beneath the surface.A forecast of the probable evolution of Soviet policy indicates a Republican Government, based on the authority of the peasants and ruling a federation of autonomous states. Time will show how far this view is justified.- The Third International will devote its main attention &apos;tb the-East, where the Soviet Government will use it as a definite
instrument of policy. It has, in fact, taken over responsibility for revolu-tionary activities in the East, and has been ordered to restrain the embarrassing zeal of its agents in the West, whore Soviet diplomacy will concentrate on promoting industrial unrest through the Western European Secretariat, with England as primary objective. Another point of view is that the Third International is gradually dominating the Government.Bukharin recently defined the tasks of three principal leaders Lenin to maintain discipline in the party and tranquillise simple souls perplexed by departures from Communist orthodoxy; Tchitcheriu to maintain relations with the foreign bourgeoisie and to convince it that the Soviet does not intend to iuterfere in its affairs ; Zinovieff to organise tho general staff of the world revolution.Meanwhile M. Krassin is reported to have said that he is almost certain that even Trotsky, for tho sake of restoring order in Russia, agrees to the capitalistic system.Lenin&apos;s present Policy.Lenin&apos;s progress to the Right continues with, if anything, accelerated impetus.He has declared that progressing to a system of State Capitalism is not a retreat to old positions, but a legitimate progress to technically and economically more perfect forms of production. The Soviet cannot furnish sufficient quantities of State-manufactured goods while the first stage in the electrification of Russia is not yet achieved. The only reasonable way of dealing with the resultant dilemma is not to prohibit capitalism, but to direct it into the channel of wholesome capitalism. The policy of concessions will give Russia a number of properly equipped big enterprises on a level with advanced Capitalism, and &quot;after several decades these enterprises will pass completely into our possession.&quot; At present Lenin ascribes particular importance to the development of petty industry as the most accessible task in a country whose industries are ruined by war and blockade.The Tax in Kind.Reporting on the tax in kind, Lenin declares that those who do not realise that it is necessary to begin with the peasants, and who incline to regard this as showing an undue preference for the peasants and the abandonment of the principle of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat are only deceiving themselves.Government Committees have been ordered to start a campaign of explanations of the tax, to report the work done in this direction, and to send in practical suggestions here there seems to have been great laxity. The tax is reported to amount to almost half of what the levy in contribution is.The Congress of Soviets of National Economy.It was reported at the Fourth All-Russian Congress of Soviets of National Economy that the whole of Russian industry would be organised into fifteen branches. Sections for food supply, organisation, production, home industry, and co-operatives have been formed.Rykoff told the Congress that they must clearly understand that their work in connection with national economy would be a continuation of the class struggle. Private property which was now coming into being would find itself in quite exceptional conditions. &quot; We have a gigantic &quot; advantage over all competitors in the territory of the Republic, because &quot; all the large industries and all ways of communication are in the hands
&quot; of the Government. If we are unable to overcome our competitors it &quot; will prove the great incompetence of our economic workers. We must &quot; recognise the fadt we have had no competitors ; we did not suffer the &quot; existence of competitors. We destroyed them by means of requisitions &quot; and confiscations even in those cases when they were more capable and &quot; more sensible than we. Once and for all we must put an end to this. &quot; We must conquer not by means of order and introduction of monopolies, &quot; -but by means of improving our work.&quot; The only thing to be done with big industrial undertakings was to lease them to their former owners. Rykoff explained that such a measure did not mean the abolition of nationalisation, as tho undertakings would remain State property. Miliutin urged that without such a measure increased production was impossible, and without increased production the Soviet power must collapse.The Third International.The principal matters for discussion at the Third Congress of the Third International, which was to open at Moscow on June 5th but has since been twice postponed, were the economic world crisis and the new tasks of the International ; the tactics of the International during the anticipated revolution and the transition period ; the relations with the Red Trade Union International and the fight against the Amsterdam International; the Eastern question; the Women&apos;s Movement and the Young Communist Movement. The appeal of the Italian Socialist Party against the resolution of the Executive Committee of the Inter-national, and that of the United Communist Party of Germany against the resolution of the Executive were also to be heard.The probable attitude of the extremists is indicated in a pamphlet issued by the Jewish Propaganda Bureau at Homel. which severely criticises Lenin&apos;s policy. The pamphlet declares that the peasants have always been against the Soviet Government and have attempted in every way to starve the Russian proletariat. Lenin himself appears to have admitted peasant hostility and to have decided to consult the peasants rather than risk the failure of the whole revolution. Lenin has forgotten that the moment he gives way to the peasant population his so-called compromise is an entire defeat for the proletariat dictatorship.In connection with the Congress &quot; the disestablishment of the Third International &quot; is said to have lately been the most popular cry in Moscow. Moscow may conceivably have to renounce the exclusive command of the movement.Many difficulties beset the International. Foreign members are dissatisfied and foreign delegates are strongly opposed to the dictatorship of Moscow, on which point the Russian Communist Party majority has refused to make any concessions. The principle of &quot; direct action&quot; is also causing serious discord. Most foreign delegates hold that the work-ing classes in Western countries should endeavour to obtain concessions before demanding the complete dictatorship of the proletariat. Zino-vieff and the Russian members, however, argue that revolution in the West could be achieved at one stroke, but they consider that before this is attempted the economic position of Russia should be re-established by an agreement &quot;with Western powers. They. think the desired effect cannot be achieved within eight or ten years, a theory with which the foreign delegates are in disagreement. In the Near East results have not come up to expectations, largely owing to an unlucky choice of agents who have antagonised the Mahommedans. The finances of the International have also reached a very low ebb.. The income for the first six mouths of this year only covers about 30 per cent, of the &quot; necessary &quot; expenditure,  Notwithstanding all difficulties the activities&apos;O AS 6868 d
of the Third International are developing, and if circumstances are favourable the Central Executive Committee, with all its branches, will be transferred abroad. Propaganda agents are being separated from the official emissaries with a view to increasing the liberty of action of both.The Central Committee of the International has issued a secret circular to the Western European Secretariat, intimating that the more the International makes concessions in the East a statement difficult to reconcile with the intensification of Eastern propaganda the more strictly radical should be its branches in the West..The Executive Committee is reported to be in contact with all Communist &quot; germ cells &quot; abroad. These now number 150. Bukharin, with two assistants, is charged with International propaganda generally : Triperovich has charge of posts on the western frontier of Russia; Sergeev directs agitation in India, Persia and the East. Lezovsky has the duty of negotiating with the German Communists.Changes in the Government.Reports from Moscow indicate a desire on the part of Moscow to dilute the Government with representatives of other parties a course severely criticised by Trotsky and postponed at his request. Lenin is said to have decided to renew relations with the West on new &quot; non-Communist &quot; lines. Zinovieff is said to be so disgusted with Lenin&apos;s new policy that he has decided to resign.The Soviet Press confirms LitvinofPs appointment as Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, in place of Karakhan. Litvinoff would appear to have thrown in his lot with Tchitcherin, who is opposed to all other parties, in a spirit, as far as can be ascertained, of pure individu-alism.Numerous changes in Soviet foreign representation are materialising. Kopp is unlikely to return to Berlin, where Joffe, who was deported by the German Government in 1918, is mentioned as his successor. Mean-while a remarkable exodus of Soviet Commissaries for &quot; rest cures &quot; abroad is reported. This unexpected &quot;wanderlust&quot; reflects the un-certain situation of the Communists. A singular story has also circulated of preparations of the Bolshevik leaders to retreat, some to Reval or Kovno, others along the Volga region Indiawards.The Bed Trade Union International.The International Alliance of Red Trade Unions meets at Moscow on July 1st for the first time.Moscow has issued a statement emphasising the importance of trade unionist co-operation in the reconstruction of Russia, and admitting the exhaustion of old stocks. Russian industry is now in a process of transition from working entirely for the requirements of the front to new mutual relations with the peasants. The fact that contact is being established with European capital will influence the re-organisation of industry. There follows cloudy talk of a single grandiose economic scheme. It is evident that small industry is to be as much as possible discouraged in favour of a concentration of great industry, the latter being presumably more easily controlled and directed in accordance with Communist ideas. The similarity to the &quot; Normalimierung-Tyfi-fierung &quot; theories of Walter,Rathenau of the Allgemeine Elektrizitaets gesellschaft (&quot;The Taylor system applied by the State to industrials as industrials apply it to their workmen &quot;) isstriking.
Moscow and the-Unemployed.Information tends to show that the Bolsheviks have created a special organization working to unite the unemployed in a common adhesion to the Third International. International Federations of Unemployed would appear to exist in Berlin and in Berne. The intimation has also been made that the British unemployed, as soon as they were sufficiently organised, would join the International Federation of Unemployed. According to a general report made on the subject by Y. Aliansky, a member of the Western European Secretariat, to the Central Committee of the Third International, this particular branch of activity developed first in Italy, through Bolshevik propaganda in the Union of Unemployed, and was spread at the instance of Vodovosoff, the Soviet agent in Rome. The report claims that at the end of 19.20 between seven and eight million unemployed in Western Europe were united, including 1,030,000 iu the United Kingdom.Anti-Bolshevik Movements.The peasant insurrections continue, despite Bolshevik denials, There aro areas in which the writ of the Soviet no longer runs, save in the towns. The disorganisation of transport renders effective measures against the insurgents very difficult.The movement in the Ukraine is reported now to be organised on a military footing, and to be developing iuto methodical military operations. Twenty-nine well equipped units are fighting the Bolsheviks, who have established a special military staff to quell the rising. The Kieff Govern-- ment is the centre of unrest, and Colonel Strouk commands the most important force. The Bolsheviks are using the weapon of terror. Over 100,000 refugees have gone to Roumania and Poland.Many Mensheviks and other revolutionary partisans are conducting propaganda in the Red Army, where they have succeeded in stirring up mutinies. The Chresvychaika has sent 500 secret agents to the disaffected garrisons to discover the leaders.All anarchist and syndicalist groups of Russia are said to have united against the Soviet, and to intend appealing to their brethren the world over for support in the struggle. This is a severe blow to the Bolshevik effort to unite the I. W.W. of North America with the anarcho-syndicalists of the whole world in the Moscow Trades Union International.Petlura&apos;s representatives are reported to have informed the Govern-ments to which they are accredited that it is not desirable to send missions to Soviet Ukraine because the Ukrainians regard all those who come to terms with the Bolsheviks as enemies. In view of the general rising now being prepared there are rumours of a forthcoming All-Russian rising of the Social Revolutionaries The Government of Petlura lays aside all responsibility for their fate.The &quot; Active Centres &quot; anti-Bolshevik movement has been organised by N. V. Tchaikovsky, former president of the North European Revolu-tionary Government, and is not altogether dissimilar from Savinkoffs movement. Both believe in the salvation of Russia from within, but the policy of the &quot; Active Centres &quot; is much more theoretical than that of Savinkoff. The &quot; Active Centres &quot; are reported to be in liaison with Green organisations in the North Western provinces of Russia, and also with Colonel Elvengren and with Savinkoff himself. Their work is., however, on a more modest scale. A touch of religious mysticism is a feature of this movement,d 2
The Position of the Co-operatives.After the Third International and the Red Trade Union International Moscow proposes an International of Co-operatives. A conference of Communist co-operative workers is to be called in Moscow in the near future.Moscow proclaims that the co-operatives must be financed on a new basis, allowing them to display their own initiative and carry out transactions independently and at their own risk. The State will find the funds for co-operative organisation work. Enterprises such as workshops, smithies, flour-mills, dairies, which belong to consumers&apos; societies and which are not being used at present, are to be restored if the Co-operatives apply for their return. Property belonging to Con-sumers&apos; Societies is not liable to nationalisation, muuicipalisation or confiscation. All estates which are not worked or bringing in ho profit are to be placed under Government Unions, so that they may be used for dairy farms and vegetable gardens.The Red Army.Trosky has prepared a plan for creating a powerful military base in the Caucasus, serving the North Caucasus, Trans-Caucasia, Turkestan, Persia and Afghanistan. The scheme was ultimately referred to a special commission. Trotsky argued in support of his scheme that recently concluded treaties gave Russia insufficient guarantees of safety. The measures he proposed included a large increase in the number of troops in the area affected by his scheme, the establishment of wireless stations and munition works and the establishment of the central military base for the East at Baku. Lenin objected that the project would have a most detrimental effect upon the economic situation, which was already catastrophic owing to the failure of the harvest, and would also lead to fresh &quot;complications with foreign powers. He foresaw that the burden of the army would result in peasant risings and a weakening of the position of the Government. Tchitcherin also feared international complications, and doubted whether results Avould be satisfactory. The Bolsheviks are meanwhile reported to be changing the distribution of their troops in the Caucasus and Turkestan. A number of units of the 11th Army are said to have been transported to Turkestan and North Persia.I All Red soldiers born in 1892-95, who live in the Central govern-ments, are now being demobilised. It is significant of the transport crisis that these men are to go home by road and not by rail. To mitigate their hardships, local authorities have been ordered to make elaborate arrangements for the care and comfort of the men.Foreign Trade Relations.The British Court of Appeal has decided that as the Soviet Govern-ment is now recognised by H.M. Government as the de facto Government of Russia, it is not within the jurisdiction of the English Courts to inter-fere with decrees confiscating goods in Russia. Accordingly the contract under which M. Krassin, on behalf of the Russian Trade Delegation, sold in England a quantity of veneer, or plywood, confiscated in Russia by the Soviet, will not be disturbed. Following upon this, M. Krassin declared in an interview at Helsingfors that goods to the value of 5,000,000Z. had been imported from England, while export from Russia would begin as soon as English ships arrived in Petrograd. M. Krassin further remarked that the commercial treaty between Soviet Russia and Germany was of great importance.  Goods to. the value of about 400,000,000 German
marks bad been ordered in Germany. No agreement as to transit could be reached with Poland. Russia would develop her shipping services so as to render transit traffic through Poland unnecessary.Krassin appears to have painted a cheerful picture of reviving trade in his oral report to the Supreme Economic Council. Big firms had opened negotiations ; banking transactions with England were in progress and measures had been taken for the opening of credits of two to three hundred millions sterling for the development of Anglo-Russian trade relations. The question of concessions would not become practical politics before the end of the summer.The Soviet has decided to elaborate rules for prohibiting the forcible requisition of the goods of British provenance in Russia in virtue of the Trade Agreement with Great Britain.It is reported that on principle Krupp and Vickers have agreed to form a new Company called &quot; Krupp Vickers &quot; for their joint work in Russian orders, principally the repairing of locomotives in Russia, and supplying the spare parts. The new Company undertakes to offer free one-third of the shares to the Soviet Government, which is to take 33 per cent, of the profits, Krupp and Vickers sharing the rest. The Soviet have a representative in the administration of the Company and two or three directors. The new company orders the spare parts at the most advantageous price, having the preference when prices are the same. Seventy-five to 80 per cent, is to be ordered from Germany, and the rest from England, Belgium, &amp;c. The Company is doing all it can to advance foreign money to the Soviet Government in exchange for different goods, so that the accounts maybe settled with less gold. The establish-ment of the Company will principally depend upon the decision of the Trade Delegation, and Krupp and Vickers have agreed to discuss the question in detail with Krassin.Reliable information is reported to have reached France that Krupps are at present establishing in Russia a large number of works for the manufacture of raw material.Krupps and Vickers are said to be quite agreeable that the Soviet Government should have a representative on the newly formed Board, with the object of controlling the activities of the new Vickers Krupp Company iirregard to Russian orders. Krupps&apos; motives in the formation of the company are said to be purely political, to establish the old friendship between Krupps-Vickers and to use the good-will of influential circles in Great Britain. Vickers, through the formation of such a company, will gain financial prestige, from a technical point of view, and from the standpoint of British-German administration.Vanderlip reports that his syndicate has obtained a 50 years&apos; lease of 10,000,000 acres of spruce laud in the Archangel Government, suitable for the production of newspaper pulp. Rumours are, however, circulating that Vanderlip has been asked to leave Moscow and that he is starting a press campaign against the Soviet. His adventure seems unlikely to survive his moribund usefulness to the Soviet Government.Soviet Gold and Finance.&quot;Interviewed at Helsingfors by the newspaper &quot; Socialidemokrati,&quot; M. Krassin made some surprising admissions. He said that the Soviet had no gold for foreign purchases. Owing to the disorders, the shortage of materials and fuel, it was impossible for foreign engineers and skilled workmen to accomplish anything in Russia, and those who were reported as proceeding there should be stopped.
In private conversation M. Krassin repeated his statemont that the Bolsheviks had no more gold. He predicted that within six months the present authorities would be out of power and that there would bo very-serious disturbances in the interior before June 15th. He added that anyway he was not returning to Soviet Russia. Meanwhile, as a rest in the wilderness, M. Krassin has bought the freehold of a house in an expensive part of Hampstead. Mine. Krassin, whose taste is excellent, has been seeing to the furnishing of this capitalist home.The Bolsheviks are reported to have had a balance of about 300,000,000 gold roubles on February 1st, and of 253,000,000 gold roubles on 1st April. During February and March payments to the amount of about 48,000,000 roubles were made.The Soviet has confirmed the estimate of 12,260,000 roubles of the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs in the Ukraine for 1920. A sum of 11,163,597 roubles has been remitted to the Commissariat for Agriculture for expenses of organisation connected with the &quot; sowing &quot; campaign. Other grants include 2,990,000,000 roubles to the Dagestan Revolutionary Committee ; 67,860,000 to the Commissariat for Enlighten-ment for the expenses of the Department of &quot; representative art&quot; ; and 1,000,000,000 for the State Art technical workshops and Institutes of Cultural Art. The issue of notes for March to the Supreme Committee of the Handicraft Industry and to the Supreme Committee of Timber has been increased by 6,000,000,000 roubles and 6,951,250,000 roubles respectively at the expense of other instutions.The Soviet has assigned 4,450,000,000 roubles for the needs of the Soviet institutions in Siberia, the Don, the Northern Caucasus and the Crimea.In six months the Department for Political Administration is,reported to have spent on propaganda 664,217,000 roubles. Revolutionary libraries and literature cost during the same period 159,000,000 roubles.Towards the end of April it was reported under reserve that during the last six months the Bolsheviks had exported through the Baltic States about 100 boxes of gold. Fifteen had gone to the United Kingdom for propaganda, 10 to France, and some to Ireland.On May 11th, Klishko in London was insisting that 335,000/. must be transferred for May. In a week&apos;s time he would be literally without any money although urgent orders for food supplies were being sent. Litvinoff had demanded that Czecho-Slovak and other currency should be purchased and so far had transferred no money. The situation might become critical and catastrophic. In a further telegram on May 20th, Klishko stated that on May 15th the Delegation^ ready money amounted to 571,000/. Money to cover certain purchases had been received to the extent of 610,000/. There still remained to be received before the end of May 1,945,000/., not including money to cover the special order for food supplies.Forged foreign money is said to be printed at Moscow under extra-ordinary precautions. The project of printing this money was elaborated by the Commissar of Finance, Chudskaeff, and sanctioned by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee at the end of January or the beginning of February. German marks are being manufactured; it is thought that false British money is being attempted as well.In this connection a Prague report says that nothing definite is known there respecting the forging of German and English currencies. It is, however, certain that recently new German-made machines for the manu-facture of Tsarist and Duma rouble notes (500 and 1,000 rbl.) were sent to Russia, and the notes are going to Revel and Norway.
The Soviet is reported to intend to re-introduce the old Tsarist system of popular savings banks attached to the post-offices aud to the various revived co-operative institutions. The Government will pay interest to the depositors. It is also rumoured that the larger banks which once had relations with foreign countries are to be denationalised.The Policy of Hugo Stinnes.A. chief aim of Hugo Stinnes is reported to be to transform Russia into a German colony. He is pursuing a double policy, on the one hand trying to tie the Bolsheviks by obligations which will make him the master of Russia ; on the other hand, realising that Bolshevism in Russia may collapse at any moment, he is attempting to sow the seeds of Bolshevism in countries which might compete with Germany for the Russian markets. *As agaiiist various denials, there are reports that a consortium of German financiers and manufacturers, headed by Stinnes and a certain Griuibaum, have received a concession for transporting into Russia their works, machinery and workmen, with a view to avoiding the export tax. A vast plan is indicated for the reconstruction of Russian industry, the effects of which will not be felt before the lapse of two or three years. He will give the Government one-third of the net profits. M. Krassin has denied that any concessions have been granted to Stinnes, but admitted that the Stinnes group had its eye on iron ore in the Kursk Govern-ment,Moscow and Sinn Fein.The official representative of Sinn Fein in Russia is said to be one Dr. HcCartain. A draft treaty between Sinn Fein and Moscow is said to exist, bestowing inter alia on Sinn Fein the protection of Roman Catholic interests in Russia. Under the proposed treaty Ireland obtains arms from Russia, permission for Irish leaders to study military and naval problems in Russia, provision for sending Irish business men to Russia, and the use of Russian diplomatic bags. Moscow has, meanwhile, repudiated all stories of intrigues with Sinn Fein.The Soviet and the United States of America.One Emil Anderson, who is temporarily in charge of the Bolshevik Propaganda Committee in Stockholm, affirms that Lenin lays great stress on the necessity of a trade agreement between Russia and America. Witli this agreement, Bolshevism will be saved ; without it, the end of its power is near.The State Department of the United States Government has, mean-while, served an informal notification on the Soviet that no chance of recognition of the Soviet Government by the United States exists so long as Americans are held prisoners in Russia.It is reported that the Bolsheviks are scheming to use the United Kingdom as a base to send agitators to the United States, as the trade agreement between the United Kingdom and Soviet Russia facilitates the entrance of Russians into Great Britain.Moscow and the British Communists.In order to clear up misunderstandings the National Workers&apos; Com-mittee Movement of Great Britain has informed the Communist Party of Great Britain that its Moscow representatives, N. Watkins and J, T. Murphy, are delegates to the Red Trade Union International,
not to the Communist International, and that Bell, the Communist Party&apos;s representative on the Executive Committee of the Third Inter-national, is neither their superior nor their subordinate, except in so far as the Communist International controls the Red International. Watlcins and Murphy will regulate their relations with Bell accordingly, remembering that they are responsible not to him but to the Workers&apos; Committee.On April 26th the Executive Committee of the Third International telegraphed to Litvinoff&apos;: &quot;Co-ordinate into one Section &apos; A &apos; tho Third &quot; International Germ Cells No. 30 (England) and 31 (Dublin).&quot;Karakhan is reported to have telegraphed to Klishko, for Inkpin, secretary of the British Communist Party, and now under arrest, a request that the issue of &quot; the number &quot; should be speeded up. &quot; We &quot; Avill soon be able to give you active assistance.&quot; The &quot; number&quot; referred to is a special number of &quot; The Communist,&quot; which was recalled after issue.The British Communist Party is rumoured to be receiving 24,000/. a month from the Soviet Government for purposes of revolutionary propaganda.The Anti-Zionist Movement.The measures taken against the Zionists many prominent Zionists have lately been arrested are explained in a circular issued to secret communist organisations abroad by the Chrezvychaika. This circular accuses the Zionist organisation in Russia of standing in close contact with the British Government and acting as an espionage bureau for them. Collusion with anti-Communist movements generally is alleged. Denunciation of the Zionists, obstruction of their work, and counter propaganda are therefore ordered.Miscellaneous.All foreign residents in Russia are now subjected to compulsory labour, except on military defence works. Foreigners in Russia on business connected with the preferred concessions to capitalists are apparently not excluded.Moscow announces that a Labour University of the East is to be opened in Moscow, attached to the People&apos;s Commissariat for Nation-Personalities.The first course of instruction in Hindustani and Indian propoganda in Moscow ended on March 31st. 120 students attended it. The second course started on June 1st, and will last three months.&quot;Der Sozialistische Bote &quot; (Sozialistitschesky Westnik) is an organ of the Russian International Menshevik Party, edited in Berlin by the Menshevik leaders Martoff (real name Zederbaum) and Abramowitch. It supports the Soviet, on condition of a dictatorship by the proletariat, not the Communist Party. Marcoff is supported by the German U.S.P.; his paper has a close connection with &quot; Freiheit.&quot;The Bolshevik Red Cross is reported to be an important organ of espionage, especially in countries with which Soviet Russia has made peace. It works under the direct control of one member of the Central Committee ; the system resembles that used by the Germans for espionage and propoganda in foreign countries.FINLAND.Extremist Movements.May Day demonstrations at Helsingfors were quiet; at Viborg and Tammfors they were more important.   They were probably meant to be
4more etiergetic, but on April 30th there were arrests at Helsingfors and Viborg, and 600 rifles, four machine guns, and some grenades were captured.On the whole, the Communists are less to be feared, and the danger of an armed outbreak is sensibly diminishing. The failure of the German Putsch disheartened the Finnish Communists, who are unorganised and lack arms. Secessions from the Extreme Left to the Social Democrat Party are reported, and re-grouping of units and closer supervision has decidedly lessened Red tendencies in the army. Arrests of Bolshevik couriers, and notably the arrest of a Finnish officer who was acting as a Bolshevik agent on the frontier, have notably diminished the amount of propaganda crossing the frontier.The country is nevertheless harassed by 67 Soviet agents working under an individual organisation known as &quot; Torse&quot; or &quot; T.&quot; In addition to special allotments a monthly sum of 250,000 Finnish marks is expended on espionage and propaganda. Germs cells exist in all the more important centres.Relations with Russia.The Government is experiencing great difficulty in keeping the activities of the Bolshevik Delegation within bounds. The Soviet Foreign Office appears to rely on the Tcheka for information, and the reports sent in by the Tcheka are drawn up on peculiar and not over scrupulous lines of their own.Meanwhile, firm in its determination to prevent the use of Helsingfors as a centre for Bolshevist propaganda, the Finnish Government has expelled two Russian members of the editorial staff of the Bolshevist newspaper &quot; deputy&quot; and of the Bolshevist telegraph agency Nord-Ost. Russian and Finnish diplomatic couriers are allowed to carry 10 kilograms of diplomatic correspondence and not more than five copies of newspapers. Printed matter for the Soviet Legation in Finland will be inspected and sealed at the Finnish Legation in Moscow. The Soviet may not send couriers for foreign countries without authority from the country of destination and the countries through which they have to pass. Finland is thus protected against Bolshevist propaganda. Moscow has been complaining that Finns who render any services to the Soviet Mission or carry on trade negotiations with it are subject to boycott and persecution.German Activities.Such disquieting porportions have German propaganda and influence assumed that Hellenius, Minister of the Interior, has been forced to take steps to check them. As a result of a warning from him, the German centre of activity has been shifted from Helsingfors to Viborg, Kexsholm and Sordavala. The &quot; Activist&quot; Society, founded in pure patriotism, has been perverted into a German propaganda organisation. Helsingfors also maintains a Finno-German Society and a German club.&quot; Activist&quot; agents show a peculiar interest in goods required by Russia, and send to Germany copies of offers from Finnish firms for the purpose of getting lower German quotations. The Germans are in contact with the Bolshevik Delegation through a Russian engineer named Russoff.Hugo Stinnes is said to be negotiating the purchase of controlling shares in the Tammersfors firm, Lokomo, the biggest engine and wagon works in Finland. He has in view work in Russia and in Finland. Stinnes is also negotiating the purchase of property at Kiveniemi, controlling rapids giving 25,000 h.p. and distant 90 kilometres from Petrograd.
BALTIC STATES.Esthonia.LitvinofFs Activities before his departure for Moscow.Approached before his departure for Moscow on the subject of Bolshevik subsidies to communistic organisations in Esthonia, Litvinoff denied that the Soviet was undertaking propaganda in contravention of the Treaty of Dorpat. He admitted the very considerable activities of the Third International, stating that the Soviet felt it could not intervene in this matter.Various indications go to show that the Bolshevik representative directs a Reval Transmission Point for the despatch of propaganda funds and literature to Europe generally. He is said to be in contact with Dublin through Krassin. On March 16th, if certain information which has come to hand is valid, litvinoff was instructed by Bukharin to give supple-mentary orders to William Rothstein, through Gukovsky, to print 1,000,000 pamphlets. On March 19th he was instructed by Zinovieff to organise a direct courier service between the English Communist Welch, in Vienna, and one Hatika-Haraki in Constantinople. Later Litvinoff was told to inform Stettin, Dantzig, and Christiania that the despatch of ships carrying propaganda literature would begin on April 28th.Trading Schemes.Esthonian opinion appears to welcome the Anglo-Russian Trade Agreement, hoping that the bulk of Anglo-Russian trade will pass through Esthonia. Reports spread by German agents that the Agree-ment contains a secret clause whereby Great Britain undertakes not to support the Border States if they are attacked by Russia have, however, caused some dissatisfaction.Various trading schemes are reported. The Bolsheviks intend making a harbour of their own at Reval ; they are also busily purchasing military clothing. T. S. Tsitsikov has concluded an agreement for the con-struction of 500 barges, to be used in conveying goods from Reval to Petrograd, and wood and raw materials from Petrograd to Reval.Leo Goldberg, a Petrograd Jewish barrister, is reported to be seeking to establish an Anglo-Esthonian bank at Reval for the purpose of exploiting commercial interests in Esthonia and Finland, and eventually trading with Russia and possibly transferring business to that country.Latvia.Bolshevik Intrigues.Agents recently arrested in Libau included one Victor E. Volodin, an official of the Bolshevik Consulate. He was hurriedly released, on account, it is said, of the arrest of the Lettish Consular Staff in Moscow. It is even reported that Bolshevik troops entered the neutral zone on the frontier. Volodin remains at Libau continuing his subversive activities. A number of communistically inclined trade unionists have also been arrested in Libau and other towns in connection with dangerous propa-ganda.   Some of them had just returned from Russia.The Government is said to have proof that the Soviet Mission at Riga has been backing the Communist agitation there and the resulting labour trouble. It is in fact reported that in the middle of April all Communists serving in Russian Communist institutions, especially those studying propaganda and knowing Lettish, were instructed to give up their posts as soon as possible and to start intensive agitation work in Latvia.
434481 *Anotnor discovery made during April was that certain officers of the General Staff had sold the plan of mobilisation in Latvia to the Bol-sheviks. Twelve persons have so far been arrested, including three colonels. Schourovsky, formerly an Intelligence Officer of the North-Western Army and afterwards chief of the Lettish Intelligence Service,from which post he was dismissed, is under close observationa purely military &quot; Sanitarya&quot; in Latvia, whicn is to concern luoeu. specially with the Lettish General Staff.   He was granted 300,000 1 Lettish roubles for May expenses.The Bolshevik Delegation itself would appear to be distributing propaganda pamphlets to the Latvian Communist organisation. It is even said that whole bands for the export of Communist literature and the despatch of agitators and spies to Latvia have been organised. One hundred pamphlets were sent to a sham &quot;cell&quot; which has been organised by the Latvian Political Defence, together with a coveriug note bearing the signature &quot; Vilsens &quot; (an alias). The matter, which is to be taken up officially with the Bolshevik Delegation, may lead to strained relations. The Bolsheviks are meanwhile reported to be making use of the flax traffic in order to pass their agents across the frontier.Labour Troubles.Workers at the electric station, the telegraph station and post office have returned to work with substantial rises. The railwaymen went on strike partly for economic, partly for political reasons. The Government refused to discuss the political demands, which included the right to organise labour Soviets, control over the engaging and discharging of workmen, and the same liberties and freedom for Communists as for individuals of other political convictions. Martial law was proclaimed along the railway lines and the train service was not interfered with. The workers at the Government railway workshops and the workshops of the naval port also went on strike, presenting the same demands as the railway men. Meanwhile, all Government employees have been granted a 100 per cent. rise.Trading Schemes.Four thousand seven hundred and eighty-five kilograms of gold have been despatched by the ss. &quot; Grenen &quot; by the Harju Bank, Reval, consigned to Peron Co. Stad., Boulogne.Lomoff, Assistant Commissar of the Soviet Supreme Economic Council, has been in Riga inspecting Latvian factories, with the object of placing contracts for repairing locomotives. There is an unconfirmed report that 4,000,000 roubles in gold have reached Riga in connection with various Bolshevik orders.The United Baltic Corporation is reported to have signed a contract with the Riga Petrograd Bank in Libau for exchanging U.S. dollars into Soviet money for deportees and immigrants returning to Soviet Russia, the transaction to take place on the way from New York to Libau. The game should pay, since even at the rate of 20,000 Soviet roubles for one dollar the parties will make a profit of about one shilling on each dollar, and the 1,500 persons who arrive every month from the States bring with them at least 50 dollars each. The business was formerly in the hands of the Bolshevik representatives in Libau, who paid at most 10,000 and, generally, not more than 1,000 or 2,000 Soviet roubles for one dollar. The contract is being kept very secret, lest the Lettish Government should raise difficulties.
lithuania.Bolshevik Propaganda.Bolshevik propaganda is reported to be intensive, and Mostovenko is-possibly even more energetic in this respect thanAxelrod. His activities are known, but the Lithuanians shrink before counter-measures. Com-munists have been in secret conference at Kovno ; agents and agitators are arriving with refugees from Russia, and the importation of arms and literature has been discovered. A warning has meanwhile been issued to parties carrying on political propaganda in the Army. Bolshevik propaganda among the troops is apparent.Lastovsky&apos;s Straits.Lastovsky&apos;s government is said to be rapidly coming to an end- of its funds, and to be making desperate efforts to get help from foreign and other sources. Its financial straits are leading it to lend a readier ear to the Bolshevik charmers, who suggest an independent White Russian State, hostile to Poland, between Russia and Poland. Lastovsky also builds some hopes upon French complaisance, based on hints of Freuch interest, which will not extend, however, to financial help.Miscellaneous.Tchitcherin has addressed a note to the Lithuanian Government denying that there are secret clauses in the Russo-Polish Peace Treaty directed against Lithuania. The note affirms that the Vilna question is exclusively a Lithuanian-Polish matter.In Kovno, besides the Lithuanian military attache Bobroff, a Com-munist, there is a military representative named Kosmatoff, a former colonel of the Russian General Staff. He is practically a Communist by conviction.His incompetence and his close relations with Axelrod have brought about the dismissal of the Minister for War, Colonel Zhukas, who has been replaced by Professor Shimkus. Shimkus was to have been sent as Lithuanian representative to Moscow in the place of Baltruchaitis.POLAND.The Left Communist party in Warsaw is reported to want Karl Radek as president. This is refused by the Right party, and a conflict has resulted.The Bolshevik delegation, the chief of which is Efion Ignatoff, is reported to include five persons, charged solely with developing propa-ganda, especially in the Polish Army. The Delegation is reported to possess 30,000,000 counterfeit Polish marks, to be used for propaganda purposes. The Moscow Executive of the Third International is said to demand the appointment of Litvinoffas Soviet representative in Warsaw, considering that he would be of immense service in preparing the world revolution.The opinion has been expressed in certain quarters that the Bolshevik cession of White Russian territory to Poland had for object the creation of trouble for Poland in the iuiure. Veiy few Poles live in the ceded terri-tory, the occupation of which will be resented by all RuFsian parties, will alienate the sympathies of the Monarchists and the Social Revolutionaries, and intensify the antagonism of White Russian organisations.
5. BALKAN AND EAST EUROPEAN STATES.GREECE.Communism.The Greek Communist Party is small, but well organised and active. It disposes of ample funds, which appear to come mainly from Italy. The principal leaders are Petsopoulos, editor of the &quot; Rizospastis,&quot; and Benaroya, a Bulgar Jew, both now in prison in connection with labour troubles at Volo. The party is in close touch with the Bulgar Com-munists, and through them with Russia. It is threatened with the - usual split over the Moscow programme ; an important section, led by Sideris, late deputy for Salonika, does not wish to accept the Moscow conditions without further discussion. There, is, however, no inherent tendency to Communism in Greece, and its only chance of a permanent hold seems to be in the Jewish inhabited parts of Macedonia. Many sailors and petty officers are said to be infected with Bolshevism, and, singularly enough, those are pleased with Bolshevism who have seen it at close quarters in the Black Sea ports. Bolshevism does not, however, appear to have any real hold in the Navy or the Mercantile Marine.The General Union of Greek Labour has demanded from the Govern-ment the resumption of relations with Soviet Russia ; the universal legal adoption of the eight-hour day ; the forbidding of the export of unworked tobacco and the nationalisation of all labour-saving machinery ; the annulling of all the anti-labour laws of the last Government, especially the one requiring Government recognition of trade unions and the one giving the Government the right to intervene in strikes op behalf of the employers-; and radical measures against profiteering.Miscellaneous.A scheme, supported by Count von Spee, is in being to run a paper in French, written from the German point of view. All depends on the funds that Berlin may provide. Von Spee is anxious to encourage the emigration to Greece of Germans who cannot find employment in Germany. One hundred German schoolmasters have arrived ; it is proposed to scatter them all over the country.JUGO-SLAVIA.The authorities, who claim to be very Avell informed of Communist doings, affirm that there is neither trace nor danger of Bolshevik activity. A later report mentions, however, the capture of some machine guns in recent raids on Communist centres. Jugo-Slavs returning,from Russia are carefully examined, and detained if necessary ; the Army has standing instructions for action against Communist disturbances and strikes ; and plans are prepared for the military control of vital services in case of need. Perhaps the strongest bulwark against Bolshevism is the intense dislike between peasants and Communists.Radic&apos;s position is undefined. There are.allegations that he approves of monarchy of the British or Belgian type &quot; as a provisional measure.&quot; Radic has lost prestige, and is thought to be coquetting with other parties with a view to covering his retreat. He has meanwhile been arrested for inflammatory speeches. His release is probable, as his pose of martyrdom in prison is more dangerous than his liberty.
BULGARIA.Communism and Socialism.Communists were warned to discretion in May-day celebrations a fact which may imply that they wore anxious to give no excuse for counter-measures. Gantcheff, the leader of the &quot; iskra&quot; (extremist) group, has declared that the results of the &quot; Red Month &quot; of intensive propaganda, organised in view of tlie failure of so many of the old members to reinscribe, were so disappointing that the Communists have refrained from publishing them. The decline in Communism is, however, veiled by the advance of certain groups, particularly of the Young Communists. The Communists have taken heart from their successes in the elections for the tax. assessment committees, to which citizens are elected in order to determine, jointly with the Government officials, the amount to be paid in taxes to the State. These successes were almost exclusively gained in Communistic municipalities.The Third Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, which opened in Sofia on May 8th, was attended by 400 delegates. Little that was new or important came to light, but the partial failure of recent efforts to enlist new adherents was explained away by a suggestion that the heads of the party were at present chiefly concerned with consolidating and revising administration. Press comment generally is to the effect that the tide of Communism is ebbing. Party finances show receipts of over 4,000,000 leva, and a surplus over expenditure of more than 500,000 leva. The press suggests that contributions from Russia largely account for such a balance sheet.A Bolshevik propaganda centre is reported to have been formed at Varna. Moscow, which supplies funds, uses the centre as the channel of its agitation in the Balkans.An Anti-Communist Measure.A Bill has been submitted to the Sobranje empowering the Govern-ment to dissolve municipal councils in exceptional circumstances arising when such councils, after three sittings, fail to agree upon the choice of a mayor and other office holders, when the budget is not voted within a settled period, and when a municipal council refuses conformity to special orders of the Central Authority or approves measures opposed to public interests. In the event of a municipal council being dissolved, the Bill empowers the Minister of the Interior to appoint commissioners to fulfil municipal duties. The Bill strikes at the Commuuist scheme to capture the municipal councils, which has had not inconsiderable success. Thus in Sofia, the 30 members of the municipality include 14 Communists ; in several other towns, notably in Varna and Houstchuk, the Communists are in a majority.Miscellaneous.Five Germans who have been prisoners in Russia since 1917 have reached Sofia on their way to Germany. They appear to be keen Communists.The throwing of a bomb during a procession in honour of the Bulgarian saints Syril and Methodius so enraged the crowd that they destroyed two houses believed to be tenanted by Communists. Many Communists, including Communist deputies, have been arrested.The Communists are reported to have carried out a trial mobilisation in three villages in the Vratsa district at the beginning of April, only the leaders and a chosen few knowing that the affair was only a rehearsal.
450The local Revolutionary Committee had hardly settled itself in head-quarters whemtho ignorant, scenting the red dawn, became faiut-hearted and slipped away under pretexts of forgotten blankets and water bottles and unwarned wives. The leaders and the faithful few who knew there was no danger were soon alone. When the truth leaked out the Com-munists were overwhelmed with ridicule.The American officials of the branch of the Standard Oil Company are reported to be on tho whole anti-British, and to have been making a good deal of pro-Irish propaganda, which has not failed of effect upon the better classes in Bourgas. It is not clear whether the propaganda is spontaneous or part of a definite campaign.ROUMANIA.Divisions among the Extremists.It was reported some time ago that, as a result of the unsuccessful general strike of last autumn and the arrest of the local leaders, the once homogeneous Socialist party had split into three factions Communist, submitting to Moscow ; Centre, Communist with reservations; and Social Democratic, moderate in tendency. The pure Communists have the largest following, but small political value, since most of their leaders are imprisoned or exiled. Moreover, the predominantly peasant population of roumania has little faith in the evangel of Moscow. The Communists are consequently reduced to exploiting general discontents, and are a latent, if not immediate, danger. The Social Democrats have chances of developing into a healthy and socially progressive party, but they, too, suffer from a lack of good leaders. Since then, all groups of Roumanian Socialists have been meeting in a congress, called as a result of the divisions. Following the decision of the Congress to adhere to Moscow, the Government ordered the arrest of all the delegates. A number of them are on hunger strike.MiscellaneousSigns of Bolshevik trouble along the Dniester have vanished, but secret Bolshevik agents are crossing the river and fermenting discord in Bessarabia. Organisations formed under the direct influence of these agents have been discovered in many parts of Roumania proper, two of them at Jassy.Moscow reports, the conclusion of a trading agreement between the representatives of Ukrainian co-operatives and the representatives of the Roumanian Central Commercial Bureau of Co-operative Societies. The agreement is to be valid for one year, with automatic extension for another year.An Odessa report sent out on May 17th quoted a Roumanian paper as saying that in a few days a Roumanian delegation would leave for Reval aud conduct negotiations with Soviet Russia.The Bolsheviks are said to be printing lei at Tiraspol.  A Jewish Bolshevik agent was caught crossing the Roumanian border with 50,000 -  lei on him, almost all false.6. NEAR EASTERN STATES. TURKEY.The Aims and Policy o! the Nationalists.It was reported during Aprihthat the Nationalists appeared to believe that their present interests required the development of friendly relations
with Russia. Tchitcherin had informed Mustapha Kemal that, if Turkey wished, the Russians could take part in the military mission which would be sent to Afghanistan, and the expenses incurred would be paid-by Russia. Moscow had welcomed the delegates from India, Turkestan, and Afghanistan in quite as friendly a way as those from Turkey.The orientation towards Moscow became definite and unmistakable in May, when Belcir Sami Bey, Nationalist Minister for Foreign Affairs, and chief delegate of the Nationalists at the London Conference in March, resigned. Following the victory of the extremists in the matter of rejecting the treaties and concessions negotiated with France and Italy, after the London Conference a new party of irreconcilables was formed in the Angora Parliament. Mustapha Kemal has accepted the presidency of this party, which stands for a definite rally to Moscow and a separation from the Entente.The fall of Bekir Sami and his replacement-in the Foreign Office by the delegate who signed the agreement between the Kemalists and Moscow is the seal on the new majority policy. A Greek newspaper has published the text of the treaty (&quot;Union of Fraternity&quot;) entered into between Angora and the Soviet. This provides for mutual aid for the emancipation of all peoples of the East and the absolute right to determine their own destinies ; rejection of all treaties and conventions imposed by force; adoption of the protocol of January 20th, 1920, as to the extent of Turkish territory ; the cession of Bateum to Georgia ; the autonomy of Azerbaijan ; the suppression of the Capitulations as opposed to a State&apos;s full sovereignty; the release, by the Soviet, of Turkey from all economic agreements entered into with Tsarist Governments.The policy of the new Cabinet is apparently to be extremist and Eastern. England is the enemy according to the Angora press. Intrigues regarding Thrace, and even apparently Macedonia, are afoot in Constantinople, with ex-&quot; Laidut &quot; Bulgarian Staff Officers in touch with the Germans.Prince Omar Faruq Effendi, son of the Heir Apparent, has left for Anatolia, and there are suggestions that he may be eventually proclaimed Sultan or Regent rather than set him up as a rival Sultan aud Khalif.Encouraged by Moscow, which promised the necessary funds, the Angora Administration has appointed a commission, presided over by Ferid Bey, to deal with Pan-Islamic affairs. The Bolsheviks are said to have promised arms and ammunition to further Pan-Islamic schemes. Considerable quantities of these, of German origin, are said to have been sent from Russia to Anatolia. A new Islamic Congress is foreshadowed, to be attended by workmen and peasants from all the countries of. the East. The Central Government &quot;works underground at assisting the Nationalists, maintaining an ostensibly correct attitude.The Bolshevik Trade Delegation.The work of the Bolshevik Trade Delegation in Constantinople is considerably increasing, and a special department, called the &quot; Russo-Ukrainian Trade Delegation,&quot; has been opened in Galata. No actual results have so far come of negotiations with certain firms, but the Soviet representatives are full of promises and optimism. Kudish, the president of the Delegation, has been spending lavishly, as well as other members of the Delegation. Kudish&apos;s work in connection with Communist propaganda appears to include the establishment of a so-called &quot; regional Extraordinary Commission,&quot; which will register all anti-Bolshevik Russians in the area covered by it, and the formation of active propaganda centres composed of tried Communist workers and propa-
gandista. The &quot;delegation&apos;is not, however, without, serious troubles. The publication of .secret instructions issued to Kudish greatly alarmed the mission, and various persons connected with it were, discharged. Kudish is being replaced by Scbeinemann, and has left for London to complain of his treatment. He has been very roughly handled, and his wider plans have been ruined.Miscellaneous.It is incorrect that Budu Mdivani is leaving Angora. He is remaining as Soviet representative with Count Shakovskoi as his deputy.Pogoryelov has transmitted 500 Turkish pounds in gold to the Beikos Bolshevik organisation for intelligence purposes.The Nationalists are said to be considering the establishment of a permanent bureau in London for Turkish propaganda, with Arthur Field as secretary. FieldV Socialist views are not likely to be generally acceptable.Certain members of the Turkish Socialist Party recently expelled from Constantinople for circulating Bolshevik propaganda have formed an organisation called the &quot; Workmen&apos;s Protection Association.&quot; This Association appears to have plenty of money, to adhere to the Third International, and to be attempting to cause a split in the Socialist Party. It is reported to be in touch with the Creek Communist Party.EGYPT.The Recent Disturbances.The recent troubles in Cairo and Alexandria bear witness to the effect of Zagloul&apos;s incendiary propaganda and to the false hopes it has aroused. So serious was the trouble in Alexandria that British troops took charge of the town. Here 76 persons were killed and over 200 injured. The movement seems to have been- mainly a revolutionary attempt to over-throw the Government and thus to challenge the1 Sultan&apos;s rescript appointing the Yeghen Delegation, headed by Adly Pasha, for London. The manifestants mostly supported Zagloul in declaring that the delega-tion has no mandate from the Egyptian people to treat with the British Government.The split in the Egyptian parties is now complete. ; Zagloul&apos;s recent policy, so far as it has been revealed, is aimed at embarrassing Adly, and at maintaining ZaglouPs claim to be the repre-sentative of the Egyptian nation. Zagloul has explained his connections with the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; by saying that the Egyptian Nationalists con-tracted with that newspaper because it was the only one in England willing to spread Nationalist propaganda. There are indications that Kemalist agents have been fanning agitation in Egypt and joining with agents of the Senussi.., : There has, in fact, been a sudden emergence in Cairo and Alexandria of Kemalist propaganda. Efforts are being made to form a Red Crescent committee, destined for the Kemalist forces, and some attempts are alleged at obtaining volunteers for the Kemalist army.Miscellaneous.Arsenal and railway shop workers at Cairo have gone on strike, and a general strike is threatened.An intercepted letter from one Biroukoff, of. the International Com-munist Bureau, addressed to a friend in Geneva, asks the Geneva Com-munist group to do all that it can for a certain Sali Bey. &apos; Sali Bey is about to: meet some Egyptian Nationalists in Geneva on behalf of Moscow;Q as 8868 e
and afterwards to go to Egypt, charged with organising&apos;in Egypt arid North Africa a Mahommedan revoluntary movement. He will dispose of large funds.A person calling himself Bradley Ferrers, and giving as address the Poste Restante, Port Said, has written to a Berlin firm asking whether they will be prepared to print a quantity of English and American Treasury notes which the writer can easily change in Egypt by means of an agreement he has with various bank managers.IPERSIA.Persia has already had occasion to protest to Moscow against infringe-ments of the Russo-Persian agreement.   She complains of the dila-toriness of Azerbaijan in despatching kerosine in exchange for Persian    I goods, of the subversive activity in Persia of a secret organisation of the Council of Propaganda and Action, of requisitions by Soviet troops, and    j of the increase, instead of the a withdrawal, of Russian troops.   It is pointed out that the result of these actions favours Britain.   Tchitcherin    j has promised Husseinoff, Commissar for Foreign Affairs in Baku, some    I satisfaction to Persia, but refuses to countenance any Persian control of    I the evacuation of troops.   As for kerosine, he wishes to know what amount can. safely be spared, since Krassin is insisting on extreme economy with benzine and kerosine in view of exchange and barter    I operations in progress with England and Italy.   He favours the main-    I tenance of good relations with Persia.The French Foreign Office has forbidden the French Minister in Persia to have any relations, personal or official, with Theodore Rothstein.SYRIA.Bolsheviks and Poale Zion.Jewish Bolsheviks in Palestine are said to number some 400, all of them armed. Prince Aziz Hassan, the Cairo Socialist, has refused to allow the use of one or two Egyptians to preach Bolshevism among the Palestine Arabs. He has also declined to let the lawyer Kamil Hussein go to Moscow on Leniu&apos;s invitation.Moscow is reported to have decided to recognise the Poale Zion Communists as affiliated to the Third International, and to help them in every way by funds and propaganda.   As a bait for Arabs and Egyptians, this party has changed its name from &quot;The Jewish Socialist Labour   I Party, Poale Zion,&quot; to &quot; The Socialist Labour Party, Poale Zion.&quot;   It is   I not to be confused with the Right or Socialist branch of Poale Zion.   I The extremists are reported to have been carrying on an extensive Communist propaganda among the Jewish workers.   Their influence is increasing.  The inflammation of feeling against the Zionists and against  I British activities and measures generally is a chief task of theirs ; they  I also agitate for a free workmen&apos;s Communist movement on a co-operative  I basis.   The M.P.S.E., or Palestine Poale Zion Left Wing, receives  I constant support from the International Communist movement in propa-  1 ganda literature and money. .Anti-British Intrigues. .  there are reports that Turkish Nationalist intrigue aims at fomenting Ian attack upon the Jews by the Arabs in Palestine.   The ultimate object iis to obtain material for anti-British propaganda and to discredit Britain iin Jewish eyes.  Bolshevik inspiration of the scheme, which is said to I
have been enthusiastically received by the Jewish section of the Angora administration, is suggested. The Bolsheviks look upon the Zionists in the same light as the bourgeoisie.Communist Disturbances.A serious disturbance occurred at Jaffa on May Day. Following interference by Jewish Communists with a labour meeting in the Jewish suburb of Jaffa an affray took place between Moslems and Jews in the mixed Moslem Jewish quarter of the town. 30 Jews and 10 Arabs were killed ; the wounded numbered 179. It was not found necessary tcproclaim martial law.   The rest of the country is quiet.7. CENTRAL ASIATIC STATES. TURKESTAN.The native population of Turkestan is by no means happy under Red rule. Moscow&apos;s easy and repeated promises and proclamations of autonomy and of consideration for the people have remained promises. What emerges are the steady Russification of the country and the control of administration by Russians deputed from Moscow. Such intelligent opinion as exists in Turkestan has no desire to break entirely with Russia, but desires to check Russification, and is concentrating to bring about a split between the Mahommedan population and the Bolslievik authorities-an effort furthered by circumstances.Three years of Soviet rule have reduced the. Mahommedan popula-tion to despair, and have resulted in the destruction, mainly through starvation, of over 1,000,000 Kirghiz alone. The economic life of the country has been destroyed, and it is impossible for the Bolsheviks to restore it. Little has been done to relieve unemployment, which has been aggravated by the repatriation of German and Magyar prisoners, and the closing down of the factories which they had reopened, and by the Bolshevik method of alleviating the situation in Russia by despatch-ing Russian workmen to Turkestan. Mobilisations continue at frequent intervals, the natives (going to Russia, while Russian contingents take their places. The Moslems have still some hope in Jemal Pasha. He was asked during his journey to Afghanistan to do something to free Turkestan from the Bolshevik yoke. He made the diplomatic reply : &quot; Wait a little longer.&quot;In spite of all,, there is reported to be no danger of a serious Pan-Turanian movement in Turkestan. In Azerbaijan, however, prospects are better, for here the Bolsheviks have so consolidated their position that no immediate conflict is likely.Bolshevik propaganda, which is directed by the Baku Council of Action and Propaganda, is aimed solely at Great Britain, and is largely effective, since there is no one to refute it. If the British Government should inquire into these activities the Soviet will contend that they are carried on by foreign elements, which cannot be interfered with, of that Russia is not answerable for what happens in &quot; Independent Republics.&apos;&apos;GEORGIA.There has been a revival of anti-Bolshevik movements among the Cossacks and Hill tribes of the North Caucasus. A general insurrection is reported in certain districts. The Red command is anxious at these risings, and is said to be arranging the transfer of troops from the Georgian front to the North Caucasus,b2
Tho Georgian Bolsheviks are working for the 6omplete Sovietisatioh of the country, without utterly destroying national independence. The Russian Bolsheviks are bitterly conscious that their, experiments. in Azerbaijan and Turkestan have made their offences rank before the Turks and the Persians ; hence their model behaviour in Georgia. Moscow appears to hold that a strong national Georgia is essential&apos; as a counterpoise to Turkey. The Russificatiou of Azerbaijan, ou the other hand, was essential in order to prevent a Turkish advance with the co-operation of the Tartar element in that country. The Menshevik leaders appear to have decided that for the present anti-Bolshevik move-ments in Georgia shall be discouraged. The Batum port area is still under martial law, and is administered on Soviet lines, though petty trade is encouraged. . &apos;. ;AZERBAIJAN.A strike caused by discontent at the stoppage of the bread ration, and lasting two weeks, broke out in the Baku oilfields in the beginning of April.Serebrovsky, the president of the Azerbaijan Oil Fields Committee, has reached Constantinople from Batum with a view to organising the export of oil from the Caucasus, The French control authorities found on him a letter from Lenin, urgently insisting on the grant of large foreign concessions from the oilfields. A postscript to the letter states that in the main the- concessions were acceptable to Krassin, who &quot;knows more about this business than he could have ever learnt from Communist pamphlets.&quot; The concessions have been offered to the &quot; Shell&quot; Oil Company of America.- The Azerbaijan &quot; Independence Salvation Committee,&quot; whose head-quarters are in Switzerland, proposes to send a delegation to Turkey, -Persia, India, Egypt, and Afghanistan to acquaint Moslem opinion with the hardships of the Azerbaijan population under Bolshevist rule,8. FAR EASTERN STATES. SIBERIA.Risings and Counter-Revolutionary Movements.Sporadic and disconnected peasant irisings continue. The secret Siberian Committee of the Vladivostok Democratic Group, helped by various anti-Soviet elements, is despatching numerous agents charged with unifying the peasantry, but lack of funds and unpractical and procrastinating methods so hamper their work as to render it of little avail. The peasants must win success through their own efforts. The Bolshevik forces are strong, but by no means entirely loyal, and might nOt long resist a united peasant movement. The whole country between Irkutsk and the Urals is plunged in chaos, overrun by insurrectionary bands, acting separately, but miited in hatred of the Soviet. Fiendish cruelties are being practised on both sides. The exasperated peasants destroy whole Communist families, including the women and children. .Towards the end of March the reactionary groups in Harbin and Grodekovo, led by Michailov, Minister of Finance under Kolchak, were reported to be preparing a rising in the spring.   They depend entirely
on Japanese support, failing which they would inevitably succumb to the partisans or the Bolsheviks. Funds are also wanting. The Democrat Group, which is opposed by the reactionary groups, was also reported tobe trying to organise a rising through the medium of the Siberian Committee., It. was indicated that Bolshevik policy lay in playing off these movements one against the other, in the belief that the reaction, against a temporary predominance of the reactionaries would drive,many of their supporters to the Communist camp.A Coup d&apos;Etat at Vladivostok.The rumours&apos; which have been current of a coup d&apos;etat at vladivostock-vostok have materialised. The Reds have been overthrown, and a new Government, headed by Merkuloff, has been established.. Merkuloff : says that General Semenolfs authority will not be recognised by his &apos; Government. Meanwhile, at the beginning of June, the Semenovites and the Kappelites, the followers of the late General Kappel, were each striving for power, and there was friction between them. Neither party favoured Merkuloff s Government, which has nothing democratic about it; Japanese policy is very cautious. It would appear to prefer either Semenoff or the Communists, but it does not want democracy. The new regime can only exist through the presence of the Japanese, who remain on good terms with Chita.The Russian Soviet alleges that Japan has entered into an agreement to transport Wrahgel&apos;s troops to Vladivostok, and that Wrangel himself is to be in command. This plan is said to have succeeded the original scheme for a new attack on Petrograd. Moscow went so far as to insinuate through the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; that certain &quot; indiscreet &quot; high British Officials were privy to those plans and assisted in their prepare-ration. The British supporters of the Soviet are meanwhile talking loudly of the responsibility of the Entente if Wrangel&apos;s troops are sent to Vladivostok, and are eaten up with zeal for the Trade Agreement. A tendeucy to hedge and to absolve the British Government from blame later became apparent.Miscellaneous.The existing Constituent Assembly of the Far Eastern Republic has been abolished. Henceforward the governing body will be known as&apos; the People&apos;s Assembly of the Far Eastern Republic.&apos; The Japanese are said to be working for the economic centrol of the Far East by buying up Russian business concerns, land, houses,- con-cessiohs, &amp;c.Possible forest or timber concessions suitable for exploitation amount to about 165,000,000 desyatins. The forests are located in the basin of the rivers Obi, Irtysh and Taza. Mineral concessions contemplate the founding of a metallurgical works producing 4.0 to 50 million poods of cast iron yearly, and include also coal and graphite, copper ore, pyrite and polemetallic, wolfram and lead, and Glauber&apos;s salt (reussite) pro-ducing districts. &apos; .JAPAN.The police have raided the headquarters of the Japanese Radical Party and arrested several leaders. v - f.,It has just.been revealed that a raid was made some months ago on the headquarters of the &quot; Omotokoyo,&quot; a so-called religious sect. The leaders were arrested on a charge of Usc-majeste. There are suggestions of a huge anti-dynastic plot, but it may be taken that this movement&apos; has been completely quashed.   &apos; - - \-
CHINA.Anarchist papers in China arc printed partly in Chinese and partly in Esperanto. One paper, known in Holland and called &quot; Liberty,&quot; recently appealed for assistance in propaganda and for proof that &quot; Esperanto is &quot; not only a language for stamp collectors and good-for-nothings, but &quot; that it is also a mighty weapon to work for the cause of International &quot; Brotherhood.&quot;   *9. BRITISH COLONIES.CANADA. The Revolutionary Movement.The great body of labour appears to be revolted by what the Mayor of Vancouver calls &quot;this Bolshevik stuff,&quot; and disunion sufficiently serious to cripple their efforts has broken out among the revolutionists. The revolutionary movement in Great Britain is followed with close attention, but there is a feeling abroad that were a revolution to be effected in Canada the United States would intervene and crush it. The impulse to agitate seems to come partly from the Third International working from New York and partly from the United Kingdom, the influence of events in the latter being very appreciable.The Communist agitation continues to progress in Western and Northern Ontario. Music and the drama are largely used for spreading revolutionary sentiments by foreigners and particularly Ukrainians, and Bolshevist propaganda is said to be slowly but surely winning adhesion.Further reports on the Canadian National Union of Ex-Service Men (C.N.U.X.) emphasise its dangerous potentialities. It looks upon itself as the nucleus of a Red Army, and has assumed control of the extremists seeking to goad the unemployed into mischief. Anyone who wore a uniform during the war is eligible for membership ; no nationality is barred, and the main object of the union is the overthrow of capitalism.The Situation in Vancouver.The unexpectedly peaceful progress of the British strike has been a great disappointment to the revolutionaries in Vancouver, where, for the moment, danger is at an end. They are now busily planning for next winter, anticipating hard times and shortage of money among the working classes. Unfortunately the local Government armed forces are weak, but a local committee, representing the Navy, Militia, Air Service and Royal Canadian Mounted Police, has been closely watching the situation and has taken necessary precautions. The Reds boast that they have, stores of arms a boast which may be founded on fact, as the frontier is difficult to guard, and smuggling is easy.All members of the Imperial Veterans at Vancouver who were unwilling to swear allegiance to the King and the. Flag have been asked to resign. It is probable that this example will be followed by other Soldiers&apos; Clubs.An attempt has been made by the C.N.U.X. to picket the offices in Vancouver of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.The Labour Position.The situation in the lumber camps is very unsettled, and it is probable that when the new organisation which is to replace the One Big Union is complete a strike throughout the camps may be called. Not only have wages been cut 40 per cent., but the policy of employing Orientals as
cooks, &amp;c, when so many while men are unemployed, has caused intense. -discontent.    None tho less tho Officer Commanding British Columbia is &quot; of &quot;opinion that at present a strike would be difficult to engineer.    The leaders of the loggprs look forward to a very hard winter and to the men beginning it &quot; broke.&quot;    &quot; Job Action,&quot; that is, deliberate loafing, and even sabotage is favoured by many men who resent the cut in wages.A joint conference of builders and their employees throughout Canada has unanimously accepted a resolution providing for a moderate and reasonable adjustment of wages based on local conditions.&quot;A number of newspapers have been notified that owing to the strike of papermakers against a reduction of wages shipments of paper must cease.Printers employed in book and job shops in Toronto have struck for a 44-hour week and a minimum weekly wage of $42 (about 10Z. 10s.). The employers&apos; offer is $36 for a 48-hour week for $33 (about 8/. 5s.) for a 44-hour week. . The struggle is likely to be a long one.The Ukrainian Agitation.The chief aim of the Ukrainian Labour Temple is to have a strong organisation all over Canada, and of all workers irrespective of nationality. Their paper in Winnipeg is in touch with all Labour papers in New York and elsewhere. Secrecy and caution are among their first principles and they are said to correspond with the Third International. Several of the more prominent Ukrainians are preparing to leave Canada to live in Soviet Ukraine.Evidence tends to show that an alliance is being negotiated between some publishing interests in Galicia and the interests, which publish the &quot; Ukrainian Voice &quot; and conduct the Ukrainian Bookstore. The manager of these concerns, a Czech, named Dojacek, belongs to the Nationalist group which opposes Bolshevism.Miscellaneous.A branch of the Poale Zion has been formed in Montreal. : Entry to the U.S. in order to attend the Longshoremen&apos;s convention, at Tacoma was refused to John Kavanaugh.The Japanese Labour Union, which has been declining in strength, has lately revived. The tone of the meetings has been somewhat revolutionary.Revolutionaries and foreigners are showing remarkable interest in education. So widespread is the movement and so uniform are its manifestations that it-is impossible to doubt that it has been planned by some central body.Considerable annoyance was felt by the British Jews in Winnipeg on discovering that money subscribed to supply food and. olothing to destitute Jews in the Allied countries during the war had been used in part for propaganda purposes by the radical element of the Committee in New York. The British Jews broke away from the New York Committee and sent the money via London and Petrograd. But once more the radical element has obtained the upper hand and has amalgam-ated with the New York Committee, against the wishes of the British Jews. These resent the selection of a radical named Sultzman to represent Canada in a delegation sent to Russia to report upon the position of the Jews in that country; The difficulties placed in the way of the other delegate chosen by the loyalists were such that he did not go.
Extremist Movements.- In reply to a question in the Australian paper &quot; The Proletarian,&quot; Communists are urged in an article in tho &quot; International &quot; of South Africa to take office in Trade Unions and more especially ultra-Conserva-tive Unions in order to revolutionise and eventually seize control thereof. In this connection it should be noted that delegates are to be sent from the British Bureau of revolutionary Trade Unionists to South America,&apos; South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and India, for the purpose of forming similar Bureaus; these will be linked up with the British Bureau and Moscow, The South American Bureau will come under the control of tho American Council of the Communist International.Affiliation with the Third International was agreed to by 37 votes to 22 at the Cape Province Trade Union Congress. The Social Democratic Federation of Cape Town has now been incorporated in the &quot; New Communist Party of South Africa,&quot; which is endeavouring to unite all the various socialist organisations.Unrest on the Railways.The Governments recent decison to cut down living allowances is greatly resented by the railway employees, who contend that by a tacit understanding allowances were not to be reduced unless the cost of living had fallen proportionately. The Government deny any such arrangement. Although a general strike is improbable, some other form of direct action may be employed, such as using the strict letter of the railway regulations as a pretext for ca&apos;ca:my methods. &apos;        -AUSTRALIA.An approaching Crisis.A serious warning has been given by the Premier to business and professional leaders as well as to workers that a serious crisis is approaching. A reduction in wages is essential. Government subsidies or sustenance doles will not be giveu, and if the workers do not learn&apos;, reason and repudiate the extremists they will be forced to do so. &quot;A warning to intending immigrants has been cabled by the Alliance of Labour, who state that unemployment is general and threatens to become acute ; there is also a serious shortage of house accommodation.Loyalist Demonstrations.May Day demonstrators tore up and burned a Union Jack which returned soldiers tried to substitute for the red flag borne by the demon-strators. It appeared that the police had given permission for the red flag to be borne, but the acting Premier declared that any insult to the Union Jack would be severely punished. He -declared that the celebrators of May Day were just as strongly opposed to the Labour Party as were the Nationalists. The Soldiers&apos; League is endeavouring to obtain legislation to prevent the use of the red flag.Loyalist feeling, which is increasing in intensity, found universal expression on Empire Day, and a. strong determination is evident to suppress the Sinn Fein sectarian campaign to undermine Australian Imperial sentiment. The prevailing opinion seems to be that if Sinn Feiners and red-raggers are not satisfied to remain in the country under the Union Jack they should be compelled to leave Australia and go elsewhere. In a suburb of Sydney where Mr. McTiernan, the noted pro-Irish State Attorney-General, addressed an audience without once referring to the Empire&apos;s flag, he. was &quot; counted out&quot; by the indignant audience and forced to leave the hall.
* Efforts are being made to persuade the Government to compel Archbishop Mannix to take the oath of Allegiance on his return to Australia, but it is improbable that any such step will be taken. Regret is expressed by the Press that the Vatican should send back to Australia &quot;a notorious disturber of the peace who had created serious divisions and aroused deep antagonism even amoung his co-religionists.&quot;Miscellaneous., All restrictions on exports, including exports to Germany and Russia have been removed. Imports from Germany are limited to articles such as&quot; parts of machinery which are unobtainable elsewhere. - ,. From July 1st next the New South Wales Labour Government pro-poses to allot a pension of 5,?. per week to each orphan child in-that country irrespective of whether they are being cared for in orphanages or private homes.. ,Peter Simonoff, the Soviet Russian Consul in Sydney, is roportedto be in close and friendly co-operation with the Italian Consul-General in , Australia, who appears to be supporting him in many ways. Instructions &apos; have been sent to Simonoff not to issue visas for Russia as no one will be admitted until further notice. Apparently Simonoff is in dire need of.,&apos; funds, for he is understood to have sent an urgent appeal to Tchitcherin &apos;&apos; for money.The Labour Conference passed the following resolution at Sydney :  &quot; That we, as members of the Australian Labour Party, pledge ourselves &quot; individually and collectively to refuse to participate in any war out-&quot; side the Commonwealth of Australia.&quot; &quot;That all manufacture of &quot; armaments shall be the exclusive industry of the Australian Govern-&quot; ment&quot; was another motion carried, the delegates declaring that, they intended to set about inculcating good feelings with the workers of other countries with a view to making war impossible in the future.WEST INDIES.General Conditions.Considerable anxiety has been felt in the islands lest a contemplated reduction of wages should result in not only distress but discontent and outbreaks. The heavy drop in the market price of sugar has impo-verished planters, who feel compelled to reduce wages. A reduction of 22^ per cent, is spoken of as a. commencement. The native cost of living is slowly falling, but it-will very slowly, if ever, reach pre-war level. In Barbados, however, acute discontent has been practically non-existent since the Armistice, possibly because the Barbadians are more philo-sophical and less turbulent than those on other islands. The great danger in case of a riot is that of racial animosity. Although the police force has been made more efficient in the different colonies, the introduc-tion of racial strife into a riot might well strain the loyalty of the coloured police. Unfortunately trade and labour unions among the coloured employees are becoming much better organised, and agitators of Marcus Garvey type, who thunder against White rule and preach the doctrine of self-determination in countries where blacks greatly pre-dominate, are becoming factors to be reckoned with as regards potential unrest. .   -&quot;Conditions in St. Lucia.Although periodical waves of unrest occasionally cause anxiety there-there is no sign of Bolshevik or other political agitation .amongst the coloured labourers in the colony, which enjoys entire freedom from trades
unions or similar organisations, any strikes or disputes being settled amicably between masters and men. The doctrines of the local branch of the Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League, and its newspaper &quot; The Negro World,&quot; are, however, very harmful and dangerous to the ignorant and easily influenced natives.Fortunately there has been a serious split amongst the leaders, and the two rival branches of tho Association are successfully obstructing each other in their efforts to cause discontent. Emigration, too, is a safety valve, and no obstacle is placed in the way of an exodus to Cuba and the Panama Canal zone during periods of unemployment. Professional agitators who often masquerade a3 missionaries from foreign countries are vigorously excluded, and severe measures are taken against deliberate fomenters of native public opinion on colour questions.A certain undercurrent of truculence and disrespect was apparent after the return of soldiers from the British West Iudian regiment and the deportation from England of a number of undesirable West Indian seamen who had been concerned in the race riots in London, Cardiff, &amp;c, after the Armistice. This attitude is, however, distinctly less noticeable than it was some months ago.MALTA.It was reported towards the middle of May that Matt Ciles had returned from Egypt to Malta, where he proposes to stay for about seven weeks. He is very quiet, probably owing to the many differences winch have arisen in the Labour Party since his departure and which he is no doubt trying to compose. Labour has in no wise profited by dealings with such extremists and undesirable characters as Borg, Tau and Arena, who have been the most active supporters of Ciles, and who are responsible for the splits in the party, and for the active measures which the Church is taking to crush the socialistic principles introduced by Giles. Important sections of labour have bowed to ecclesiastical authority, Which has strongly denounced class hatred, and would appear to hold the weapon of excommunication in reserve.The &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; has for some time been regularly distributed among the dockyard workers, and a good deal of other communist literature has appeared. It has, on the whole, failed of effect, owing to the terrors of the Church. Giles is said to have brought with him a good deal of literature, of a nature as yet unknown.10. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Unemployment and Labour Troubles.In the whole history of the country it is said that there have never been so many unemployed people as there are to-day. The Government estimate is 3,000,000, but the Labour Unions claim that 5,000,000 is nearer the mark. The &quot; American Economist &quot; believes that foreign competition is the chief cause and the only cure ihe immediate enactment of a high tariff to bar the American market to foreign goods.The wages of men employed in the leading industries during the year ended April 1st have decreased on an average 6&apos;4 percent. In some parts of the country wages of unskilled labour have been reduced as much as 50 per cent. As against the policy of wage reductions, a tendency is shown by employers to reduce the number of their employees in preference to cutting wages.
The Automobilo industry, owing to a boom in automobiles and automobile parts, shows the greatest increase in employment, i.e., 31,368 workers for the month.In order to enforce his decision that American seamen should accept a wage reduction of 15 per cent., Admiral Benson, Chairman of the U.S. Shipping Board, seized six vessels belonging to the Board which had been chartered to a private concern, because the operators had, agreed to pay the old wage scale. This was a decided blow to the strikers as it proved that the Government forces were against them. President Harding was petitioned by the shipowners t&apos;o declare a state emergency and man the ships with Government crews. This step is probable as the Administration is convinced that American shipping cannot compete with foreign companies with the old wage scale effective&apos; for another year. American vessels continue to leave port partly manned with volunteers, and steamship officials are seeking a court injunction to restrain union officials from using intimidating methods to remove crews.It was reported towards the latter end of May that the Marine Workers&apos; strike had collapsed and that their representatives had given the Secretary for Labour full powers to accept for them such wage reductions as the secretary deemed proper. The rules and working conditions proposed by the secretary were, however, rejected by the American Steamship Owners&apos; Association, and the Marine Engineers Union also repudiated the wage reduction. The strike situation is unchanged. It should be noted that the pay of marine engineers was more than doubled during the war period, and at the end of April last it was 59 per cent, higher than the present pay of British marine engineers. The proposed rate is 68 per cent, higher than the pay received in 1914, the chief engineers receiving $250 as against $152 *88 paid to British engineers, with other ranks in proportion.A reduction of 12 per cent, on an average in railwaymen&apos;s wages has;,J been announced by the Railroad Board. This order becomes effective on July 1st and affects the members of 31 Labour organisations and the employees of 104 railroads. A general strike is, however, improbable. &quot; Unskilled labour, which is chiefly affected, had its wages increased 20 per cent, last year, while the cost of living is said to have dropped 30 per cent. It is expected that the reduction for this class of employees will be between 12 and 16 per cent.Rival armed forces of union and non-union labour are encamped for 15 miles along the slopes of the Cumberland mountains in West Virginia to fight for the supremacy of the Mingo coalfields. Martial Law has, meanwhile, been declared in the West Virginia and Kentucky coalfields, where half-a-dozen men were shot dead in the course of three riots arising through strikes in these districts. The promulgation of the proclamation has been left to the judgment of the Minister of War, who is awaiting further, information,A decrease in the wages of some 7,000 workers in the job printing industry, retroactive to April 1st last, is provided for in the decision prepared by the arbitrators in, the wage controversy between the employers and the union. Both sides had agreed to stand by the award of the arbitrators, and this decision means that; the workers will have to pay back (in instalments) to their employers more than $200,000 collected in April. - -.A settlement has been reached in the clothing strike which has, been in progress since December and has involved 65,QO0 workers.  Fifteen
per cent, wage reduction has been acceptpd for sill workers With the exception of cutters, whose wages will be graded. A board of. arbi-tration has been formed to settle disputes.The &quot;Right to Work&quot; vindicated.The &quot; right to work &quot; has been vindicated in America in a decision given in the Supreme Court at New York by Justice M. L. Erlanger. The action arose through the decision of a firm to run its&quot; business oh open-shop lines. &quot; A man may work or not as he shall choose,&quot; Justice Erlanger laid down. &quot;He may strike and peaceably seek others to &quot; join, but he may not be compelled to join a union if he is not disposed &quot; to do so ; employees may not be enticed from their employment by &quot; threats or otherwise . . . and all his rights will be protected by the &quot; Court.&quot;Grave Colour Riot.A serious race riot has occurred at Tulsa, Oklahoma, in which some 3,000 whites and negroes took part. The original cause was, as usual, the alleged assault by a negro of a white girl; accessory causes were what the blacks considered the greed of oil speculators determined upon wresting from the negroes valuable holdings, and what the secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People described as peonage and slavery on the farms. The property loss is estimated at over 300,000/. The negro quarter, one square mile in area, was burnt; 10 whites and 40 negroes are reported to have lost their lives.Indian Intrigues.According to the account of Jaggat Singh, who returned to San Francisco on March 12th, he has visited Europe and was smuggled across the Atlantic by arrangements made by 0&apos;Leary in New York similar to those employed in the case of Sinn Feiners. He visited &quot;Kartar Singh&quot; in Switzerland (probably Karta Ram) and both men saw Eckhart in Berlin. He accused the Bengalis in New York of-wasting $4,000 of the Ghadr money. This assertion caused intense indignation at the Ashram quarterly meeting, in consequence of which S. N. Kar resigned the editorship of &quot; The Independent Hindustan.1&apos; The Ashram are still intent on opening centres in New York and St. Louis, and one of their chief aims is to secure arms and introduce them into India. The monthly expenditure of $2,500 for &quot; confidential&apos; propaganda &quot; has been sanctioned by the Committee of the Ashram. &apos; -Miscellaneous.The Vancouver &quot; John Bull&quot; of the 9th April contains a letter of protest against the presence of Dr. Hardiker in Canada.It is reported that &quot; Big Bill&quot; Haywood, leader of the I.W.W., has fled to Soviet Russia to escape a 20 year gaol sentence for violation of the Espionage Act.All the property of the convicted draft evader Bergdoll, who escaped to Germany and has resisted all efforts to persuade him to return, has been seized by the Custodian of Enemy Alien Property. The value of the seized property, including real estate and bank deposit, is estimated at over  200,000.The &quot;Sinn Feiner &quot; of New York bitterly attacks the Pope for his letter to Cardinal Logue. The Pope is charged with being: under the influence of British Black and Tan agents at the Vatican &quot;who.pull the strings.&quot; Ireland, says the &quot; Sinn Feiner,&quot; is not to be made the football of Anglo-Papal politics.
. A-parcel of Bolshevik literature which was retained on the 3rd of May contained a book by &quot; Bishop in partibus Bolshevikium &quot; William Montgomery Brown, D.D., entitled Communism and Christianism which has this motto,   Banish Gods from Skies and Capitalists from Earth.&quot;&quot; The Modern Press &quot; of New York, which claims to be a voluntary association of workers who print literature on economics, appears to be a cover for a radical organisation, probably guided by vicious revolutionary elements, which surreptitiously prints and distributes subversive literature. A possible prosecution is under discussion.A manifesto to the General Membership of the I.W.W. has been issued from Headquarters. It reports an improvement in the operation of the printing plant, which now appears to be paying its way, but members are severely reproached for their neglect in paying dues and the finances of the Society are said to be extremely critical. The manifesto concludes with an urgent appeal for funds.11. CENTRAL AMERICAN&apos; STATES. MEXICO.A parade of Catholics as a protest against Socialists was followed by an affray in which the Catholics were fired upon by the Socialists ; 50 persons were killed and several wounded.Considerable indignation and unrest has been caused throughout the country by the latest executive measures for breaking up large estates and establishing the small landowner. While another Agrarian Bill is . being discussed in the Chamber of Deputies several of the States of the Union are issuing their own Agrarian Laws. Some of these propose the payment of compensation to the legal owner by means of State Bonds, paper which, in view of the impoverishment of the Government, will be 1 almost valueless.Both the landowners and the proposed recipients express resentment. In more than one case the local authorities have imprisoned and threatened with punishment the poorer people who have refused to take the land, charging them with violating the constitution, or obstructing . the Government.   Those given possession of the land have found that the legal owner refuses to pay them the usual wages, and that they are not to receive with the land money, oxen and implements with which to . work it.   They would much prefer a return to the old order of things. , The landowners are uniting for mutual protection and threaten armed resistance to a further division of property..  Meanwhile, a protest has been addressed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs by the Spanish Charge d&apos;Affaires in regard to the property of &apos; Spanish subjects.12. SOUTH AMERICAN STATES. ARGENTINE. The Position of Buenos Aires.. A determined effort is being made to break the tyranny of the unions at Buenos Aires. Towards the.middle of May an important group of importing and exporting houses decided to use non-federated labour, if the Federated Dock Labourers persisted in refusing to handle cargo delivered in the docks from carts driven by employees of these houses who were not members of a certain union. The Government responded by declaring the port of Buonos Aires closed, and a complete
paralysis of the port followed. The Government made some abortive efforts to reach an amicable solution, but the intractable strikers refused to resume work until they received a Government guarantee that no non-federated labour would be allowed in the port and docks.Meanwhile, representatives of all foreign shipping companies addressed a strong letter of protest to the Minister of Finance against the suggested Government control of labour employed in all port opera-tions. In the past such control has resulted in the practical exclusion of all non-federated labour. The shipping companies suggest either that the system of so-called officialised services be abandoned and replaced by complete liberty of work, or that if tho system of Government control of port labour is maintained all honest working men, whether members of a federation or not, should be allowed to work. Coupled with this sugges-tion was a veiled threat that the companies might be forced to abstain from sending their ships to Argentine ports unless the Government affords proper protection.The Government appears to have been moved, and.reopened the port by a Government decree permitting access to all qualified labourers. Both union and non-union men are engaged, adequate protection having been guaranteed for the latter. The port area is being patrolled by armed police and naval guards.The European delegates of the Argentine Labour Federation has now called the attention of all dockers&apos; unions and vigilance committees to the fact &quot; that all cargoes from Argentine ports loaded after May 28th is .&apos; black &apos;,&quot; and appeals have been made for a refusal to handle them.A general strike has been calied by the Workers&apos; Federation but has not so far proved very effective.A secret meeting of the Committee of Quayside Workers was raided on June 1st and 177 men arrested. A fire which broke out on the &quot; Martha Washington,&quot; whose crew is on strike, is believed to be the work of incendiaries, who are probably responsible also for the serious fire in the customs warehouse.CHILI.Jt is reported that the Students&apos; Federation which has joined the Third International can rely on all possible aid from the Communistic International at Moscow. The necessary plans will be made and carried out in Holland.The Minister of Justice has asked the Supreme Court to expedite the trial of the members of the Chilean headquarters of the I.W.W. The President of the Supreme Court took exception to this procedure which he characterised as unconstitutional and an infringement of that Courfs prerogatives, an action supported by the press, which claims that judicial proceedings in Chili are attended by such grave defects as to render some of the business worthy of a tale in the &quot; Arabian Nights.&quot; The Court of First Instance announced that it saw no reason for suspending the proceedings in the case of many of those implicated and recommended that they should be prosecuted in the ordinary way for illegal association, the I.W.W. being, in the opinion of the Court, an illegal corporation.URUGUAY.By a large majority the Socialists have adhered unconditionally to the Third International. Dr. Emilio Frugodi, a Socialist member of the Chamber of Deputies and for many years leader of the Socialists, has in consequence separated himself from the party and retired from Parlia-ment, an example followed by many others who believe that the &quot; action of the masses &quot;is doomed to failure in Uruguay.
PART II1. POALE ZION AND COMMUNISM.The Right and Left Wings of the Jewish Socialist Labour Party (Poale Zion) are in conflict throughout the world. It has recently become clear that the Left Wing has gained the upper hand in Germany, Austria, Poland, Czecho-Slovakia, Scandinavia. In the United States the right wing, with difficulty, predominates. In Latvia the Left Wing, which has always worked in harmony with the Soviet Government and the Communist Party, recently joined the Third [nternational, and the Lettish Central Committee of the Right Wing of the Bund, which still adheres to Amsterdam, is continually attacked by the Soviet Government, Which, in March, gave orders that its leading members, amongst them Arensohn, Savitzki, and the journalist Bihnschtok, should be arrested.In England what may be called the original Poale Zion Party, with headquarters at 27, Sandy&apos;s Row, E., and a membership of 1,200 people, is still affiliated to the National Executive of the British Labour Party, and also to the Zionist Organization, which embraces all aspects of political opinion. This parent body, at a conference heldi n Manchester last year, rejected the conditions of the Third International. In August, 1920, a Communist branch, affiliated to the Third International, was formed at 12, Kerbela Street, Bethnal Green, London, and has since sent violently subversive manifestoes to branches of the Jewish Socialist Party abroad. This Left Wing has only one other branch in this country, situated in the East of London, and the two dissident branches are reported to have between them not more than 50 regular subscribers, although they are said to have a much larger number of sympathisers in the local Jewish Trade Unions. Formed in August 1920 by its present secretary, Hersch alias Harold Share, a Russian tailor, the left wing was admittedly designed to fight what it terms the bourgeois Zionism of the central organisation.The only country where the Poale Zionists appear to be absolutely unanimous against the Third International is Russia. A circular issued on the 25th March by the Chresvychaika to secret Communist organi-sations abroad, confirms previous reports regarding the persecution of Zionists in Russia, and the intensified campaign conducted against Zionist organisations elsewhere. The report indicates that during the winter months many Zionist leaders had been arrested, and avers that Zionist organisations in Russia and other parts of the world have always worked against the Communists and assisted anti-revolutionary parties. It describes them as hand in glove with the Entente govern-ments and the bourgeois class to suppress labour movements in sympathy with Communist ideas. Written in a haze of suspicion not unlike that of professed anti-Semites throughout Europe, it scents anti-Bolshevism in the fact that Zionists in Western Europe and in anti-Bolshevik Russia have never been molested. It orders the Comrades to try to counteract Zionist plans and to inform the Chresvychaika about them. Document sent, from Zionist organisations in Europe to the head office in London will be especially valued. These orders are addressed to members of the Jewish bund abroad, who are to be their chief executants  a fact which appears to be the first practical outcome of the recent decision to amalgamate Communist and Bund organisations.
The Communist Party in Soviet Russia possesses a special Jewish Section, and in April it was decided to form a Jewish central office attached to the Communist International. The tasks assigned to this office are agitation and propaganda among the Jewish proletariat, and the handling of Jewish questions of the Communist International. But the office is in itself international, and one of its purposes is, by the formation of analogous institutions in other States, to form an inter-national union of all Jewish sections.In a recent Conference of the Communist Party of Bulgaria in May a separate conference of Jewish Communists was held, dealing with Jewish institutions, propaganda,and organisation in the country a device which may be taken as typical of the intentions of the Communist International with regard to Jews everywhere. It is reported, for instance, that in April the Moscow Jewish Commissariat discussed the question of raising funds for Communist propaganda in Yiddish in France and England. And, soon after, the Jewish Communists in both countries asked the Soviet Government through an intermediary to give subsidies and other help to the Jewish Communist press in Western Europe.2. MOSCOW, THE NORWEGIAN STRIKE, AND THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT.As far back as the end of March the Norwegian Government received information that Moscow was fostering unrest in Norway, and that either a big strike during the negotiations on the various rate agreements expiring between May and July or some other pretext would be used by the revolutionaries to fulfil their ends.   Reports fro m rs,Stockholm, and Copenhagen gave evidence of the subversive designs of Moscow in Scandinavia.   Olaf Scheflo, Jacob Friis, Martin Tranmael and Langseth at Christiania, and Kaasmolii n Northern Norway, as well as organisations in Bergeu and Trondjhem, were known on very serious evidence to be preparing a revolution.The Authorities were, moreover, informed concerning Sailors&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Councils and &quot; Germ Cells &quot; in the Army and Navy, while the indifference of a great number of State employees was notorious.Shortly before Easter the Government took action. Employees of the telephone, telegraph, and railway and other Government works were carefully sifted, and endeavours were made to obtain an estimate of the reliability of the fighting forces.The result of this last operation was not altogether satisfactory. While generally the non-commissioned officers, and particularly the rank and file of the Guards regiments, were reliable, units were reported to be averse to using arms in case of civil disturbance, except under strong provocation, from which it might be calculated that the insurgents would be sensible enough to abstain. A certain unrest in the Navy might, it was thought, also be dangerous, if the Navy had not specially pledged naval reserves. Prominent customs officials at the main forts are reported to be reliable, and keen on fighting the Reds, but in the north of Norway, where the officials are generally yonnger, their faith-fulness is more dubious. On the railways, again, the old stock of employees is reliable, but those recruited during the last few years from the ranks of the more educated proletariat are less sure. The best that can be said is that they will probably have a regard for their own skins. Finally, in Norway, as elsewhere, the teachers are in the head and fore-front of the Communist movement,. Generally persons. of more reading
than souse, their outlook is just sufficiently wide to have given them tastes and desires which a poor stipend leaves irksome and unsatisfied. More than 60 per cent, of Norwegian teachers have Communist leanings, largely on account of their financial grievances.The Government has made many preparations. Its survey of roads and motor material tells it that the traffic can be maintained even during a general strike. The boards of the Rifle Club, the National Sporting Association, and the Motor Boat and Sailing Association have been quietly asked to be ready in case of emergency. The necessary military measures have also been taken, both in the chief centres and in northern Norway. A scheme of rationing had been prepared. Motor craft on land and sea will be commandeered in case of necessity. Among the workmen in electric plants and waterworks there are already men of experience who, it is ascertained, will continue in case of a strike.The knowledge which the Norwegian Labour party and its leaders have of these preparations, and indications to them by the Government that they will not be scatheless if matters come to an extremity, may explain their hesitancy now.In spite of the misgivings of Folkets Hus, a general strike has since been declared. It was probably felt that talk must become action. Revolution has been preached for three years to a sympathetic, or at least non-hostile, working class, but there has been no violent action. The Norwegian Labour Party has made comprehensive plans for the strike. The general idea is, by progressive stages, to impress public and labour with the power of the N.L.P., to make the bourgeois dependent upon the services of the N.L.P., to weaken their resistance by alter-nately making or withdrawing concessions, to seize the power of government, and to control national administration. Unrecessary terror is to be avoided, and things are to be made easy for the lower middle class.;Special funds appear to have been allocated for the above activities. The Co-operative Societies, with liquid assets said to amount to about Kr. 4,000,000, are bound to advance as much money as they are requested for running the strike. These funds are independent of those of the N.L.P. and N.O.T.U.The necessary orders are given by the strike committee of the N.L.P., which possesses dictatorial powers, and is assisted by various satellite bodies which can suggest a change of policy but have no executive-powers. Various measures are taken to safeguard the execution of orders.&apos; As regards the allotment of duties Scheflo is responsible for the organisation of the strike or of revolution under Moscow&apos;s orders.; Tranmael directs general propaganda and intelligence; Tronsdal is Paymaster and chief of the &quot; Agitatorcorps&quot; and their members ; J. Eriksen keeps up connections with various organisations; E. Qlaussen, directs illicit activities; Langseth is director for the taking over and managing of traffic and public services ; while Madseu directs the activities of workshop councils, workshop committees, and controls the activities of the co-operative societies.When strike or revolution is started the workmen&apos;s police has to do police duties, strike pickets are sent out, and the &quot; Samorganizations &quot; are to run the public traffic according to instructions given by the strike or revolutionary committee. The co-operative societies are to sell to workers only, and to serve the rest of the population only so far as the strike committee thinks expedient. When the time comes workshop councils and workshop committees are to seize and run their respective works, and in case of open conflict with the authorities &quot;mass action&quot;; will be resorted to. Big conflicts are to be avoided, and the strength of the crown forces to be methodically exhausted. The &quot; Aktionslag &quot; are o as 8868 f
to be the instruments of sabotage and destruction of communications, works, &amp;c.Meanwhile, the strike would appear to have ended in the nntici-pated failure, and to have been called off on June 10th.3. eastern propaganda and the trade agreement.The following is a translation of a letter from Members of the Council of Propaganda and Action in the East regarding the Anglo-Russian Trade Agreement and Bolshevik Eastern Policy, written shortly after the signing of the Anglo-Russian Trade Agreement by Ruskuloff and Abdur Rashidoff, the Kirghiz and Ferghan members of the Council of Action and Propaganda at Baku, to Madame Stassova, a member of the Presidium of that Council. This letter shows the effect of the Agreement on communist propaganda in the East.&quot; . . . . The successes obtained by the Kemalists on the Greek front have evoked strong feelings of enthusiasm among the Moslem masses, and have acted as a powerful stimulant to their national inclinations, to the obvious disadvantage of Communist propaganda.&quot;As regards Communist propaganda in the East, we feel it our duty to state that the signature of the Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement has dealt a fatal blow at our work in this direction.&quot; Hitherto, of course, the main basis of our agitation was our struggle with England. This was the most convincing argument in our work and the cornerstone of our propaganda. The conclusion of the Agreement has placed the Eastern Communists in a very awkward position, and has entirely ruined the work which they had built up with such difficulty.&quot; We are being approached with a multitude of questions by the younger generation of Moslems, the general purport of which is : &apos; If England is our enemy, how is it possible to sigu an agreement with her ? If England is an imperialist power against whom it is essential to wage war, how can Soviet Russia come to terms with her ? Futhermore, how can one reconcile the organisation of an entire network of Communist centres in the East with an undertaking to desist from propaganda ?&apos; The population has lost faith in our Communist work, both in Turkestan and Afghanistan, and one must suppose also in India.&quot; This is one side of the question. The other side shows that the promise made by Soviet Russia to England to refrain from propaganda in the East has brought about an acute split among the members of the Communist party in Turkestan and among responsible party workers in that country.&quot; The recent decrees by Lenin concerning the right of free trade and legislation for the working classes, as also his concessions to the peasantry, have come to be regarded by many Communists as tantamount to a renunciation of Communist principles.&quot; In these circumstances what possible sense can there be in con-tinuing our work iu the East ? We cannot conceal from you, and we ask you to inform the Council, that all these facts have given rise to a great deal of confusion among our ranks, while the Eastern centres of propaganda are at a loss to know what line to follow.&quot; This state of affairs renders it essential to convene a special con-ference in Baku at the earliest date possible, so that representatives of the branches of the Council in the East can come together and discuss the many urgent questions regarding the tactics to be adopted in view of the change in the situation.
&quot; It is very desirable that such conference be attended by Zinovicv in person, as well as by other members of the Central Soviet and the Central Executive Committee, since it is necessary to decide once and for all whether thp promise made to England to refrain from propaganda in the East is a mere fiction or a serious political act.&quot; Iu bringing the above suggestion to the notice of the Council, we wish to emphasise that we are not merely expressing our own personal opinion, but the general opinion of our organisations, and we beg you to give it prominence on the list of proceedings.&quot; Furthermore, we deem it necessary to inform you that, in view of the present change in the situation, we consider the holding of another general congress of the peoples of the east in September next not only untimely but even dangerous.&quot; A conference should be convened, consisting exclusively of the collegium of propagandists, and the date of such conference should not be later than June 15th.&quot;4. the career of ivan antonovitch beresin.M. Krassin is seeking to introduce to England as his second-in-command Ivan Antonovitch Beresiu, late Minister Plenipotentiary of Soviet Russia in Finland. Double motives appear to underlie this request. Beresiu has proved himself a trusty servant of the Soviet, and is therefore satisfactory to Moscow ; on the other hand, he is reported to be a valetudinarian though the fact of his ill-health is not yet definitely established and to speak little or no English. He would therefore have scant chance of interfering effectively in Krassin&apos;s affairs. Beresin is described as a shy man, inclined to stand very much on his dignity, and looked upon by Moscow as not altogether a suitable head of a delegation.Beresin&apos;s career has run a chequered course. He is a Lett by birth. Early identified with the Lettish Social Democratic Labour Party, in close touch with the party of the same name and principles in Russia, he studied in Russia and abroad, and started his active connection with the revolutionary movement in Russia in 1900. Periods of imprisonment preceded his expulsion to the Olonetz Government, his escape to Germany, and his secret return to Russia. A second expulsion in 1908 was followed by a period of wandering in Europe and America. During the war Beresin lived in Switzerland and represented the Lettish Social Democratic Labour Party at the Zimmerwald Conference in September 1915. After the revolution in 1917 Beresin returned to Russia, and was rewarded by election to the Ail-Russian Central Executive Committee. He is the Beresin, alias Winter, who acted as secretary to the Executive Committee of the Third International, and as such signed, jointly. with Bukharin, a letter of instructions to American Communists, telling them that direction of strikes, direction of unemployment, and fomenting insurrections was their work. Thus tried and tested, Beresin appeared at Berne iu 1918 as representative of the Soviet Government, provided with a large staff and with funds amounting to some tens of millions of Swiss francs. His activities were almost exclusively propagandist, and their sinister effect was seen in the general strike of Armistice Week, when the patience of the Swiss Government was exhausted, and Beresin and his staff were expelled from Switzerland. In 1919 he was Com-missar for Public Education in the short-lived Soviet Government of Latvia. It is virtually certain that Beresin returned later to his old love, the Executive Committee.    In the capacity of secretary he signed the
notorious undated instructions regarding the secret pursuance of Com-muuist propaganda, sent to Soviet Delegations some time before the signing of the Anglo-Russian Trade agreement, and published in the &quot;Times&quot; and &quot; Daily Telegraph,&quot; to tho general consternation. Shortly after its conclusion, Krassin was enabled by certain inaccuracies in the spelling of Russian names Beresiu&apos;s among them-to deny the authenticated-ticity of the document, and added that no such person as &quot; Bersin &quot; had ever been secretary of the Third International. Beresin&apos;s literary activity has been considerable; he has expounded philosophy, the history of literature and political economy, and at one time helped in editing the,&quot; Pravda.&quot; In 1920 he was chairman of the Peace Dele-gation at Dorpat, and finally was accepted by the Finnish Government, not without misgivings, as Soviet emissary in Finland. He is, in short, an able and &quot; ideal &quot; Communist.Printed by EykE and SrOTTlSWOOte, Ltd., East HaMing Street, $.0,4-
