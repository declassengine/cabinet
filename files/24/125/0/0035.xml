The dailv output is lout 8,00&apos;.; tons.    Yesterday some miners resumed work at- the Glass-ghton Colliery, Yorkshire, and have agreed to ;jring up enough lil to keep the ovens going.Most of the Glasgow dockers resumed work on June 6th:   there have a few fights between dockers and volunteer workers but in some see thev worked together amicably at the beginning of the week.   The [ike has cost the dockers over  20,0 ?vj.A copy of a letter showing the relations between Eccleston Sr-uare the miners&apos; strike i3 given.Some details of the negotiations of the cotton industry are set In this report.The Communists are experiencing a set-back both in supporters and money and their speakers appear to be restrained b? the fear of secution.   A letter has been intercepted addressed to the British tion of the Red International of Trade Unions, which was forwarded the Russian Trading Delegation.   This is another breach of the cling Agreement.There is strong feeling against the prospective increase of rent (8 month.On/i
On the night of June 7th there was a resumption of Sinn Fein outrages in London and Liverpool.    Telephone wires were cut and also signal wires on the Great western Railway.   A series of outrages are planned for next Saturday night, &quot;but precautionary measures have &quot;been talcen.While the situation in Ireland has not improved, the seizure of Rebel documents is seriously embarrassing the Rebels.    The boycott of Belfast goods has extended to the Banks.   It is persistently reported that Michael Collins has &quot;been in London during the last fortnight&apos; and that lie went about disguised as a Roman Catholic Priest.
TIIE COAX MINERSOn June 3rd the Executive of the Miners&apos; Federationformally rejected the Government proposals, while theowners accepted them conditionally:   on June 4th theGovernment stated that tho offer of  10,000,000 wouldremain1 open for a fortnight only and on June 7th the miners1representatives met the owners at the latter&apos;s request,&apos; further joint meetings were held on June 8th and 9th andit %9 reported that the owners now offer:An increase on the standard wage, assured for twelve months.Actual wage paid to be not less than 20$ above the standard,reduction of about 3/* per shift, to be further reduced with the aid of the Government&apos;s  10,000,000 (as long as this lasts).Lower paid day wage workers to be guaranteed asubsistence wage &quot;by the help of a wages fund in each district, from which conciliation boards would make awards.Surrender of all profits (standard and surplus) for a period of three monthsmtaM   ]uu!l,uxuISational V/ages Board,Re-grouping of districts according to their economic relation,The miners1 executive has summoned a delegates1 meeting for to-morrow morning and will recommend that a ballot be taken:   if this recommendation is followed, there is little doubt that the ballot will result in the requisite majority for a resumption of work.    It is, however, of the utmost importance that the issue should be put &quot;before the men in simple terms and plain figures:   they complain that they have not understood previous offers, owing to their complicated nature.   There is a very strong desire to return to work in practically all the coalfields and most of the men are interested only in the v/a&amp;es question.About 200 pits throughout the country are now working, but in some cases only two or three men are employed:the/
the total daily output ia about 8,cno tons.Good order in the coalfields continues, but distress is increasing. * \Most of the Glasgow dockers resumed work on June 6th and volunteer workers have been dismissed:   there have been some fights between the two bodies of men, but in a few cases they worked amicably together at the beginning of the week.   The strike has cost the dockers over  20.000,E00I.ES TOJ SQUABE MD TEE MI KEFS1 strike a letter has just been obtained which throwsISconsiderable light upon the part played b.y Eccleston Squai in industrial disputes, and more particularly upon their activity during the miners&apos; strike.    The letter, which was written by Page Arnott, refers to the third week in April:&quot;last week was the most exciting we have had for some time5    Most of each day there was the miners&apos; publicity committee, while this same week was chosen by the Engineering and Shipbuilding &quot; rades Federation and by the Cotton Unions - cotton, mark you, which has always remained in its fastness (Lanes j and has never come to Cancssa before - to ask&apos;us to I large jeba for them.   So we wired hither and thither and eventually had to do the most press issg job ourselves *   That was the Shipbuilding one:   and now, j after I stop writing I must forthwith, resume a re-act of the hasty memorandum Rath and I d:ldt and turn it into a pamphlet for their use.    8 you?if; Oxford ana 1 young Cambridge, together with many eld Fabians, cams trooping into the L.R.B. to help tho nr-x^rs in their fight whilst, said miners came daily to link up publicity with policy,    T&amp;wney, Greouwood, Cole, Lloyd and otliers of us did the writing up of stuff - j and above all Sir Leo Chiozza Money,     I cannot tell you what a pleasure Sir Leu is.   Undoubtedly he is on of the originals of the Admirable B,B.   His manner ai the bedside of the Miners1 Federation may have been, a trifle trying but his desire to help is so olear tl like B,3., he offonded nobody and so, it has been a full week ,,0 Next week, too, Mr. Bernard Shaw aocorf to a posecard he sent me, intends to go talking in all the big centres for the miners.   To-day I had a talk with Lansbury and Mellor.   The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; (I presume you see it regularly) is going to make a terrific effort to kee-p the miner&apos;s end up:   but i will need lot-: of people talking all over the cotuatr and encouraging them to stick it.   Cole is in a stati of ox..;r*tte fury and farther &quot;left&apos;T than I have seen him fox months.   The Communists are comparatively ca aa they had fully expected the strike to be called o The whole thing is grist to the mill.&quot;WAGE/
WAGE REDUCTIONS&quot;Notices of the proposed reductions in wages were posted in the engineering shops on June 7th:   efforts are still being made&quot;to secure a settlement without a stoppage;   the men&apos;s representatives have been in touch with the Ministry of labour and it is possible that another meeting between the two sides will be arranged.The feeling of the majority of engineers is still i)t   strongly opposed to the ,suggested ,wage ;cuts.   The men say that had there been.a greater.reduction in the cost of living they would&quot;have accepted the reductions, but that under existing conditions the.cuts proposed are too drastic.On June 4tft.a,meeting ofthe l^otl3ingiiam;;and district branches of the Amalgamated Engineering Union unanimouslydecided to reject the employers&apos; proposals and called uponItheir executive, in the event of a stoppage, to--press&apos;for &apos; the union&apos;s- original, demand for an advance of 6d-. per hour.Some&apos;of the Coventry engineers showed signs of irritation ... -with their officials:.   in April last the Daimler IfoiorCompany informed their employees that if they would accept a slight reduction.in wages, more work would be guaranteed. , .Most of the men favoured acceptance of these proposals, but .. local union officials refused, permission.

The cotton employers accepted an invitation to meet the Minister of labour yesterday.    My correspondent was present during the whole of the eight hour negotiations at Victoria Hotel, Manchester, on June 3rd, and states that til conference broke down after the following offers had been made:Employers1 offer95 per cent reduction on niece prioe list rate of wages....................;80 per cent reduction on piece price list rate of wages.......................70 per oent reduction on piece prioe list rate of wages conditional on the operativesY aeotions of the Negotiation Committee commending its acceptance forthwith..........80 per oent reduction (again) on piece price list rates...............Operatives&apos; offer30 per cent reduction on piece price list rate of wages.....................40 per cent reduction on piece price list rate of wages.....................47*4- per cent reduction on piece prioe listrate of wages50 per cent reduction on piece price list rate of wages.....................70 per cent reduction unconditionallyPost dating notices for one day or until Monday to continue discussions and negotiations.............................Post dating all notices for a fortnight in order that members could be voted..........That the differences be submitted to Independent Chairman whose decision should be accepted as final.......................That the differences should be submitted to arbitration.........&apos;.&apos;.................refused, refused.refused, refused.refused.refused.refused.refused, refused.refused, refused.refused, refused.The operatives apparently did their utmost to avoid a stoppage, but the employers are said to have been . uncompromising.    Their attitude is doubtless due to the fact that, as a result of the extensive speculation vl-lcloccuiret!/!
occurred after the Armistice, the industry is over-capitalised.Ho solution of the deadlock in the,woollen textile industry ha3 yet been reached.visit of &quot;m Kim so ggro to plaistow &amp; sqtjct/ark:Striking evidence of the loyalty of poorest London was afforded during the visits of the King and Queen to .   Plaistow and Southwark.   The comments and warmth of feeling expressed by onlookers was remarkable in view of the present industrial situation.    In the trade union room of the Eed Triangle Club, Plaistow, a young man interrupted the proceedings with a reference to unemployment and the miners&apos; children, but his voice was drowned by Indignant cries from the other trade unionists, who afterwards stated that he was&apos;an extremist who was practically unknown to them.-1(THE OOMMUBISTS -     .   , \ /&apos;The Constitution and Lules of the Party are now being issued and the organising secretary explains in covering letter that,&quot;Due to the raid and the action, of the . printers who refused to print after all the matter had been set up, the delivery of the constitution has been, unfortunately delayed.&quot;It is absolutely essential that a copy of this constitution.be in the hands of every one j of our members, so that they may thoroughly understand the. position,the party now,occupies according to the decisions of the last conference.&quot; .....asThe Constitution and,&apos;, Rules are substantially/outlined in my report Wo. 104 but it is worthy of note that the minimum rate of sub.s.c.riptions from members to branches is 6d. per, week:  lqf this sum 3d. ,is remitted to headquarters, Id. to the, Divisional Council and 2d. is retained by the branches.    The membership of the P&amp;rty was recently givenofficially/
officially as 5,000, but as unemployed   and sick members are exempted it is doubtful if more than 4,000 are at present paying members,    The income from thia source is therefore probably not more than  50 per week, a sum which does not nearly meet the expenditure, on officials&apos; salariesThe party is still actively concerned with the question of prosecutions,, which are costing them dearly in following and in finance..   , A manifesto has been issued urging all working class organisations &quot;to take steps to .protest against the present regime of suppression&quot; by sending &quot;resolutions of condemnation1&apos; to the Prime Minister Home Secretary and local Members of Parliament, by forming Free Speech Committees and by organising &quot;mass meetings of protests.&quot;   &apos;     ..... ,. *On June 11th a meeting of the South Wales Divisional Council of the Communist Party will.be held at Cardiff: the organising secretary has sent  A.E. Cook, the divisional organiser, in addition to his weekly salary of  7.10.0.,  20 towards the expenses of the meeting with the remark &quot;This- is all the cash we can spare Just at the moment.

0   &apos;1   -23&quot;Other business; ,(Branches are invited to send items for consideration not later than Thursday, June ?th).The following is a list of the branches of the Communist Party at present in.existence in South Wales with their latest membership returns:Aberdare lbAbertillery 31Ammanford 19Barry Port 12 BristolBlaina 18Bargoed 12Cardiff 26   .Chepstow 13Cly dach- on- Tawe 30Caerphilly 15Exeter 6Glynneath 20 Gwaun-cae-Gurwen (Garnant)      22Gorseinon 14Merthyr 9Newport 45Maesteg (Nantyffyllon) 17Porth (Tnyshir) 43  .Pontypool (Pentrepiod) 27 PontypriddMid-PJhond&amp;a 20TreorchyTon PentreSwansea 8Ystradgynlais 60Mountain Ash 17 PlymouthThe Divisional Organiser writes, however, inconnection with this list:&quot;Two of the branches, Swansea and Merthyr, will have to be removed from the list unless they are re-organised.    Swansea is in a bad way and is practically defunct, Merthyr is only slightly better. I am endeavouring to get the active members together in these places (if there are any) and see&apos;if branches can be re-organised.  Exeter, I understand, only had five members and was not really a branch under the rule3, but its five members are an active five, running propaganda meetings regularly, and according to one or two issues of the local Exeter rags I have seen, causing quite a stir, it would be a pity to rule Exeter out.    Comrade Lucy is very keen and active.    Recently I put him in touch with some comrades at Chagford, 16 miles away who wrote re joining, and I advised the Chagford ohaps to join Exeter for the time being.&quot;I have been round the following branches, Aberdare, Mountain Ask, Glynneath, Porth, Pontypridd,Mid-Rhondda/
Mid-Bhondda, Treorchy, and Ton Pentre and. found them active and carrying on good work during the crisis, also I visited Caerphilly and the two new branohes at Maesteg and Bargoed.&quot;The personnel of these branches is one entirely of active members, every man jack keen on the movement.   As a matter of. fact regarding membership I&apos; find the branches a little inclined to be too regimental on the question of admitting new members, and inclined to keep same out until everything about them is known.&apos; .&quot;I have applications next week to address&apos; meetings at (rilfach Goch, Blaengarw, Blaokwood, and Tredegar, and in the first three I think good branches can be formed. -   .&quot;I am sorry about Mclaine.   Old prejudices die hard, and there is a strong&quot;prejudice against anyone who had the misfortune, to be in the old B.S.P.I here in -rales,    Besides our problem is a peculiar one,-we have to fight here the ultra-Marxist, the pure industrialist, and the man who can do the most good here is one who has.been formerly identified witl! the industrialist position. . Marshall did excellent work for thai; reason, so did D. Ramsey and others. Newbold did ^ood work with the left wing I.L.P, We have on oha hand the extreme Marxist industrialist] and on the ether a wobbly left wing inclined I.L.P. and the best propagandists for Wales are either industrialists &quot;or ex-left wing LLP&apos;era,     Mrs. Crawford would do us good with the latter if she could come down.   To give instances concerning the hostility of the industrialists, a branch of the party was to be formed at Perndale last week, but the industrialists opposed us and carried the day for the time being, the same happened at T;;lorstown and at Tonrefail.&quot;However, I can use comrade McLaine and keep him mostly in Cardiff, Newport and one or two other places.    I trust you.will let me know if an executive representative will.be down for divisional conference,&quot;The South Wales Divisional Council has issued a publication entitled &quot;The Communist Propagandist&quot;;   this contains chiefly Press cuttings, quotations and statistical information for the use of communist speakers. No. I, which bears marks of inspiration by Walton Newbold, gives details of the industrial profits of various large businesses from 1912-1920, a.comparative table, based on Board of Trade figures, of the cost of living and the course of wages, &quot;financial indicators&quot;,, &quot;progress of trusts&apos;  &quot; numerical/
i :;v i\ ;/* \ ,r9rnumerical representation of trade interests in the Rouse of 1 Lords and the House of Commons and quotations from various p speeches.Many of the South Vuleg &quot;branches have informed the Divisional Organiser that owing to the miners1 strike their funds are very low and that they are unable to contribute anything towards the expenses of delegates to the Divisional Conference..,Walton Newbold, v/ho has been doing good organising work for the Communist   Party in South Wales, is paid  6 per week by headquarters.    He is, however, extremely nervous of prosecution and has taken the precaution of writing and then reading his speeches, ?/hich have been singularly mild for the Communist platform.The&quot;Emergency Powers Act, resulting in the imprisonment of loading officials, has greatly affected the Midlands branches of the Communist Party, the members of which have considerably decreased.    The Midland District Council will meet at Birmingham on June 11th and J.;mes Stewart is likely to be severely criticised for bad organisation and for losing important documents on the occasion of his arrest. ,The Leicester communists have a credit balance of 4/- and are very disheartened thereby:   they cannot afford to engage well-known speakers and those available do not raise good oolloctions.    J. Binns has received a registered letter from &quot;Solidarity&quot; demanding payments for papers received.    He has not acknowledged ordinary letters. William HcLaine spoke in a minor key at Leicester on June 5th He was evidently afraid of arrest and his speech was a complete failure:   the collection amounted to 6/8d. and the hire of the wagon from which he spoke cost 3/Sd.   Tho Leicester branch &quot;dislikes his arrogance&quot;:   as they areresponsible/
responsible for his railway fares, food and lodging, they wanted him to travel by bicycle but he refused and they are now at their wits1 end to know where to find the necessary money.Coventry branch have sent all books to headquarters for duplication in case of a raid;   they have collected  36 in oash towards the &quot;Rooms Defence Fund&quot;, and  161 in promises:   they think they will^get enough to olear expenses of their action brought by the Independent Labour Party and have a slight surplus.   The case was settled in the Chancery Division on June 7th, the communists aoceding to practically all the demands of the Independent Labour.Party.On May 31st the treasurer of the Midland District Counc of the Party was asked by the Coventry branch to give a fin statement: he said there were outstanding bills for  90 odd which would leave a credit balance of about  7.15.0.: since March 31st he had paid  22 to local speakers.W. Palmer, of Birmingham, addressed a communist meeting in Coventry on June 5th:   he protested against the imprisonment of Leonard Jackson and said that the workers in Russia would not allow such a thing.   This statement was met with cries of &quot;Go to Russia you....&apos;. &quot; and some disorder followed.   He urged his audience \o join the Workers1 Committee movement with a view to taking over the control of industry and said that Coventry v/as an ideal place for such work.   Fresh disorder greeted this remark, his hearers shouting &quot;Rot1.&quot;, &quot;You want shooting1.&quot;, &quot;You wouldn&apos;t &apos;t dare ta like that in Birmingham!&quot;On June 2nd at Birmingham the chairman of a privatecommunist meeting Solid:&quot;I am sorry to inform the comrades that I have received letters tendering resignations.   In the main these resignations would seem to have been forced by feminine timidity,   The wives of these men are evidently bordering r,po.u nervous breakdown and it is ...   only consideration if or the wishes of the women that Messrs. Thompson, Harris, Stockwell and Socole havedecided/
decided to leave the party.   We   hope that the women will cultivate a braver spirit, and not retard the good work that their men folk are doing.   Respecting Comrade Socole, he states in his letter that a contributory cause   of his resignation is that members of the C0m.aun.first Party have started the rumour that since he came out of prison he has become a &quot;Police Spy&apos;.&quot;My Yorkshire correspondent reports that &quot;the slump in socialist agitation continues&quot; and. that &quot;communist speakers are now lying very low as a result of recent prosecutions combined with the fact that their outfit is very stale,&quot;1Jleweaatle comTiunists are looking ahead and their leader told my correspondent in confidence that his party ha^ hoped to bring about a general strike in the spring of 1922, but that the failure of the Triple Alliance would probably cause the date to be postponed.James Stewart has been taking the Hull communists totask and said in the course of a scathing address delivered in Paragon Square on June 2nd:r,You daren&apos;t be men!   You darenrt speak your   -mindl   You daren&apos;t be men, and half &quot;of you aren11 men, you1 re slaves and serfs I   you&apos;r&amp; frightened you lose your jobj   -There isn&quot;t one of you dare walk sis feet down the street with mo (not that I want your oompany) you are frightened the authorities would think you would be contaminated.&quot;The following is an extract from a report furnishedon Hay 31st by a member of Ruskin College regarding themovement in Oxford:&quot;The University Labour Club have organised a few meetings and, all the speakers,so far, have been 1ragged1 by a number of the undergrads;    Bat the communist meetings have suffered worse treatment. We had a London chap named Bishop speaking for the CP, and the students turned out in full force.   He was speaking in the open, and Mr, -RvM, fox, Ruskin, followed when all of a sudden the undergrads pushed forward and we got a rough   time.   However, I managed to betaken out with nothing more than a bruised arm and poor Pox was knocked off the platform and their - behaviour was Hellish,   They &quot;broke up the platform and stood round in a circle sieging; God Save the ICing, When we managed to scramble together the crowd followed us round to Roskin but all the doors were locked so they stood ounside singing.   Last Sanday the same thing happened again so we decided to. run a special meeting v      on June 12th (cpen air) and invite a number of Oxford University sympathisers to take part (Free speech meeting).   The Communist Party met on Sunday morning andwe/
we decided to make this meeting on 12th non-party so tlj we,can enlist several Influential speakers to take part...&quot;Ve have a&apos; few communists among the undergrade and they have loyally supported us at all uhe meetings and have not been afraid to use their fists.&quot;INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES IN MOSCOWAn important letter has been sent from Moscow by thesecretary of the Provisional International Council of the RejTrade Union International and the &quot;manager of the Englishseotion&quot; to the British Bureau:   the flap of the envelopein which the letter was enclosed bore the stamp impression&quot;Russian Trade Delegation, 128, New Bond Street. W.I., 1stJune, 1921&quot;,   The following are extracts:&quot;In accordance with the decision of the Provisional Council the Congress of the International Trade and Industrial Unions will take place in July 191 The sections of various countries under the&apos; Provisional Council are now feverishly engaged in gathering all material peri*ai,uir.g to the labour movements of the respective countries and their attitude towards the Refll Trade Union International.&quot;We consider that, in this respect, our bureau ought to play the principal role for the Red Internatic as the Central Organ of trade and industrial unions, fo it is evident that nobody could know the labour raoveme better, in England, say, than our bureau which is to unite around itself all unions, or at least their minorities standing on the same platform as we.,.&quot;We hope that.,..the British Bureau is taking the f aotive part in getting representatives elected at the general meetings of the workers ,t so as to have the riglj to speak in their name.   Generally speaking the Provisional Council is even not aware of the structure of the British Bureau, in spite of the/former&quot;a ceaself requests, we would therefore be very,glad to have from you, in the near.future, a description of the Labour movement in Groat Britain and her colonies in general, and of the structural organisation of the British Buref In particular, according to the following scheme:I.

As regards . communication between us, and upon which the course of.: our work depends, we would request you to..inform us 1 under what conditions the British Bureau considers it;. possible to establish regular connections ;With us.   We would advise you comrades, to give your attention to this point, for with us the question of contact is a matter of primary importance.&quot;Lismer, the organising secretary of the British Bureau, is making arrangements for four delegates to attend the Moscow meeting:   two ctf these are Harry Pollitt and Ellen Wilkinson for whom lismer Is arranging one letter of credit for  350 on a bank in the Baltic provinces and another of  150 on a bank in Berlin.    The delegates are to travel direct to Libau or Reval, first class, and their passports are to be vise&quot; by the Russian Trade Delegation.Tom Barker has now returned to this country and is working for the formation of the new International Marine Transport V/orkers1 Union:   he has approached the National Workers1 Committee movement and a discussion on the matter will shortly take place.TRADE UNION INTERNATIONAL: :     v..!:y,u       -vtt yfiOn June 4th about 280 trade union delegates attended a meeting at Sheffield arranged by the British Bureau:   thetwo stock resolutions were passed with a few dissentientsbut some of the delegates afterwards admitted to my correspondentthat, owing to the apathy of the majority of the workers, the\conference amounted to little more than talk:   their only hopelies in unemployment and subsequent hardship.The Lancashire organiser in reporting his activities to headquarters states that the members of the various localcommittees/
