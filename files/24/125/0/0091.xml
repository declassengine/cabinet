1 ? [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1921.616J0fSECRET.CP.-3087.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 27th instant.General State of the Country.Statistics of Outrages.The statistics of outrages for the week present no outstanding feature. The number of ambushes was slightly lower than that of last week (32 as compared with 39), and the casualty list is correspondingly lighter (25 as compared with 40), but it would be premature to attempt to attach any particular significance to these decreases. . Police casualties for the week were 2 killed and 7 wounded, and military casualties 9 killed and 7 wounded. Of the 11 fatal casualties no less than 5 repre-sented acts of cold-blooded assassinations. On the 19th instant a subaltern of the Worcester Regiment, stationed at Portobello Barracks, Dublin, while driving in a car accompanied by a civilian friend and two ladies, was held up by a party of armed men, about 3&apos;miles outside the city, and, on being recognised as an officer, was taken away in another car and shot by the roadside. On the same day 3 military officers, stationed at Fethard, Cashel District, Co. Tipperary, were kidnapped while out walking in civilian clothes, and were found murdered near Woodroofe, Cahir District, on the following day, their bodies being blindfolded and marked with rifle and gunshot wounds. Another callous and brutal murder was that of 2 Auxiliary Cadets, who were shot dead in Graf ton Street, Dublin, about 7 p.m., on the 24th instant, while in civilian clothes and unarmed. I regret to report the death of a very distinguished officer, Colonel Commandant Lambert, commanding the 13th Brigade, Athlone, who was seriously wounded at Moydrum, Co. Westmeath, while returning by car from a tennis party there on the 20th instant and died about two hours later. The car was challenged and called upon to halt by about 5 armed men, who at once opened fire when the driver, instead of complying with their order, attempted to put on speed! Another occupant of the car, a lady, was slightly wounded by a revolver bullet.An outrage of a particularly dastardly character was perpetrated by the rebels on the 24th instant when a troop train, returning from Belfast after the Royal visit, was maliciously derailed near Adavoyle Station, Co. Armagh. This train was conveying a detachment of the 10th Hussars which had formed His Majesty&apos;s escort at Belfast at the opening of the Northern Parliament. A portion of the line was removed and a number of bombs which were placed in the gap exploded under several of the coaches which were hurled down the embankment. Three soldiers and the guard of the train (a civilian) were killed and 2 soldiers and the assistant guard were injured. About 60 horses, which were being conveyed in the rear portion of the train, were either killed outright or had to be slaughtered in consequence of injuries.No fighting of any importance took place during the week. Three R.I.C. barracks and 1 Military barrack were unsuccessfully attacked, but the rebels were driven off in every case without difficulty.[6516]
One Courthouse (Union Hall, Co. Cork), 1 vacated Police barrack (Holycross, Co. Tipperary) and 4 Coastguard Stations (Laytown, Co. Meath; Howth&apos;and Dolly-mount. Co. Dublin; and Queensborough, Co. Louth) were destroyed by fire. An attempt to destroy another Coastguard Station (Tramore, Co. Water ford) was frustrated by a police patrol which, apprehending the attack, lay in wait in the Coastguard Station and opened heavy fire on the rebels, who were taken completely by surprise and quickly abandoned their enterprise. A number of the raiders are believed to have been killed or wounded, and the whole of the petrol and oil intended to be used for the destruction of the Coastguard Station fell into the hands of the Police.Four civilian murders attributable to Sinn Fein were committed during the week, the victims in two cases being ex-Service men.Other outrages included 64 raids on mails, 7 raids on the offices of rate collectors in which sums of money amounting to over 7,847/. were taken, and 31 raids on post-offices in which the telephone instruments and apparatus were either taken away or destroyed. The last-mentioned kind of outrage was the most noticeable form of rebel activity of the week. In addition to the raids on post-offices similar raids were made upon an hotel, several private houses and a number of railway stations and signal cabins.Arrests for outrages and political offences numbered 73 for the week.Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.Sixty-six trials of civilians by court-martial were concluded during the week, the convictions numbering 56 and acquittals 10. The following is an analysis of the sentences imposed: 9 sentences of penal servitude for life. 17 sentences of penal servitude (3 years to 15 years). 20 sentences of imprisonment with hard labour (6 months to 2 years).2 sentences of imprisonment without hard labour (6 months to 9 months).8 fines (1/. to 20/.).Total  56Eight of the life sentences were imposed for the offence of assembling by night with firearms with the intent to raid a house by force, and one for participation in an ambush of the Crown Forces in which a soldier was wounded. Ten years&apos; penal servitude was imposed on a Constable of the Royal Irish Constabulary convicted of manslaughter, and 5 years&apos; penal servitude on an Auxiliary Cadet and a Temporary Constable convicted of robbery. ,Internment Orders.The following is the usual weekly statement as regards internments: Orders made      ...        ...         ...        ...        ...     3,691Orders cancelled for reasons other than release       123 Releases ordered ...        ...         ...        ...       290        413Number of persons now interned    ...         ...        ...     3,278The number of appeals awaiting hearing is 33.State of the Police Forces.The week&apos;s recruiting figures for the Royal Irish Constabulary show excellent results. The net increase in the strength of the Regular Force is 135 and in the strength of the Auxiliary Division 4. I am glad to note that the difficulties, due to labour troubles, which have recently impeded recruiting for the Royal Irish Constabulary in Great Britain have now been successfully surmounted. The following are the usual particulars for the week:

From Donegal Quay to the City Hall the streets were thronged with cheering spectators, but notwithstanding the fact that party feeling in the city had recently been running high the most perfect order prevailed and no untoward incident occurred to mar the success of the day. It was noteworthy that the Nationalist houses along the route of the procession displayed their full share of the decorations and that, although the purely&apos; Parliamentary proceedings were confined to the representatives of the majority party, the public welcome to their Majesties appeared to be regarded as a matter which concerned all classes and sections of the people in an equal degree. His Majesty&apos;s eloquent appeal to all Irishmen &apos;&apos; to stretch but the hand of forbearance and conciliation, to forgive and forget, and join in making for the land they love a new era of peace, contentment and goodwill&apos;&apos; has produced a deep impression on the minds of men of all parties, which augurs hopefully for the future.Present Political Situation in Ireland.The Prime Minister&apos;s letter to Mr. de Valera has had a remarkably good Press. The &quot;Irish Times,&quot; representing Southern Unionism, the &quot;Freeman&apos;s Journal&apos;&apos; and the &quot;Irish Independent,&quot; representing the most extreme anti-Government opinion, and the &quot;Belfast News Letter,&quot; the official organ of Northen Unionism, join in proclaiming it as a bold act of constructive statesmanship which may prove to be a turning point in the history of Ireland.  By the &quot;Freeman&apos;s Journal&quot; it is
described as &quot;a definite and important advance&quot; towards peace, and by the &quot;Independent&quot; as &quot;an event of the greatest importance.&quot; The latter journal, which is perhaps more closely associated with Sinn Fein than any other leading Irish newspaper, having openly supported it so long ago as the General Election of 1918, goes on to express the hope that &quot; in this grave crisis nothing will be said or done to mar the prospect which this development unfolds.&quot; It is with this prayer in their hearts that the great majority of the Irish people are now waiting to see what response will be made by Mr. de Valera and his colleagues to the Prime Minister&apos;s invitation.H irish Office, S.W. 1, June 29, 1921.Statement showing Total Number of Serious Outrages from January 1, 1919, toMay 21, 1921.   ,Weekly Totals to Week ended June 25, 1921, and Totals at that date.*                ... .1..&apos;.
