G.Irish Office,&amp;.W.I.3rd June, 1921.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERKNT.)
Exchequer assistance towards payment of compensation for malicious damage in Ireland.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary supplementing that which was considered by the Cabinet on 22nd March, 1921 (CP. 2637).The subject referred to in my former minute and its enclosures demands further immediate consideration for the following reasons:-(l)   In the Boroughs of Dublin, Cork and Limerick and the Counties of Cork, Dublin, Kerry j and Tipperary (north Riding) the shares of the local authorities in Local Taxation Account monies are exhausted or almost exhausted although a large number of compensation awards made to Crown Employees or their dependents still remain to be paid,(2)   His M^esty1 s Government has recently refused to agree to the provision of money by the American Relief Commission for distribution to innocent sufferers in Iceland:   by so doing it has accepted a moral responsibility for seeing that loyalists who have been granted decrees in the County Courts and have been unable to obtain payment from the local authorities are compensated out of monies withheld from those authorities..(3)   The present campaign of murder of the Crcwn Eoroes has brought in its train a series of murders of lcyal and inoffensive civilians, who have become unpopular not on account of their political connections, but for agrarian reasons, friendly disposition to the police etc   The dependents of these persons, who are often in very humble circumstances, have been awarded compensation in theCounty
County Courts, and owing to inability to enforce payment are largely dependent on charity.For these reasons and for those advanced in my previous memorandum, I sutonlt that the Government should -Introduce a short Bill (I) creating a fund within the meaning of section 27 of Government of Ireland Act out of which advances could be made by the Irish Govern-ment, with the consent of the Treasury, to individuals, provision being made for the State to table  over the individual1a right of recovery of the amount so advanced and the interest thereon from the Local Authority, and to collect the debt by Deduction from State Grants etc as under the Criminal Injuries (Ireland) Act, 1920.(li) Empowering the Lord. Lieutenant to utilize for such advances, before drawing on the above fund, any withheld monies in the Local Taxation Account Irrespective of Its statutory allocation to individual counties, subject, however, to adjustment at a later stage by transfers from the above fundi.Such advances would be made on the following principles:-M Crown Employees and their dependentbj^At the rates at which advances are already being made out of the Local Taxation Account.    The need for the above Bill is specially evident in the case of these persons as unless the awards in their cases are promptly met to a substantial amount there is, firstly, a breach of faith on the part of Government and secondly, no guarantee that the Government of Southern Ireland will see that the local , authorities pay the awards in future.(b) Government Departments - loss of property:By annual &quot;instalmants spread over 5 years in accordance with the Criminal Injuries (Ireland) Act, 1920, this beingthe/
the arrangement now In operation In Northern Ireland, whore the County Councils are meeting decrees.Although payments under this head merely mean a transfer from one Government pocket to another, it is desirable that such transfer should bo effected in order that Government!q position vls^a^vls private individuals holding decrees may not be ultimately prejudiced, (c) Private Individuals * person and property. By annoal instalments spread over 5 years subject to reduction of the original Award at the discretion of the Irish Government and the Treasury in the case of awards of great magnitude or of ooviously excessive amount.Before considering payment, enquiry would be made to ensure that the person compensated had no connection with any illegal organisation, fee-It is estimated that if payment were made on the basis proposed above, the monies now in the Local Taxation Account ( 900,000) will bo sufficient to meet existing unpaid awards;   a further sum of  600,000 should be placed to the credit of the Fund, in order that this v/ith the amounts acoruing to the Local Taxation Acoount may be available for making prompt payment in awards not yot reported or likely to be made between now and December 31st, 1921.The matter is now very pressing and I trust that early authority will be given for the introduction of a Bill on the lines proposed.(Intd)   H.G.&apos;Irish Office.S.U.lo June 3rd, 1921.
