C   -^ittee of Home Affairs-HIS S0CUMS11T 13 THE HO PERT? 01? HIS BRITANNIC MJESTTfS G0VBHBM3KT).DECLARATION OF THE) TERMINATION Of the WAR. Memorandum by the chancellor of the Exchequer.Urgent representations have been made to me by the London and Manchester Stock Exchanges and the Clearing Banks that an official declaration of the end of tuts War should now be made, notwithstanding the non-ratification of the peace treaty with Turkey.It is very desirable that suoh a declaration should he made in ordor that outstanding transactions which were to he concluded /ithin 13 months after the conclusion of peace may now he closed, and I am strongly in favour of such declaration as a further step towards financial decontrol.It would also have the resultj as stated in C.2*3032 circulated hy the Minister of Pensions, of enabling savings of some  580,000 a year to he effected on the Pensions Vote.I am advised by the Attorney-General that.there is power to make the required declaration without further legisla-tion and I annexe a draff Order in Council for the purpose. (In the event of the treaty with Hungary being ratified by  ranee early in July, as is probable, a drafting amendment will be re-quired) .It is desired to bring the termination into force on August 4th, and I therefore ask for the approval of my colleagues at a very early date.feC RE T.CABINET.ip.-3081.(Intd.)
