Memorandum by Minister of Agriculture and Flsheries.There is an insistent demand, dating from before the ftar, for a revision of the legislation affecting the Fisheries. My predecessor contemplated the introduction of a fisheries Bill last session, and such a Bill was promised in the king1s Speech. Circumstances, however, prevented its introduction, and, in reply to various inquiries from representatives of practically every branch of the Pishing Industry, I have from time to time expressed the hope that I should be able to introduce our legislative proposals early in the present session.     My failure to do so has called forth very vigorous criticism in many quarters, and^ more especially, from Boards of Conservators, who desire, not merely to see the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Acts consolidated and simplified, but also to be placed in a stronger position for dealing with the pollution of rivers and generally for protecting and developing the Fisheries entrusted to their care.My original intention was to introduce a Bill, or two Bills, dealing with both Sea Fisheries and Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries^ and Bills for &quot;both purposes are in draft.     tho Treasury, however, objected to the introduction of the sea Fisheries Bill, on the ground that it will involve the expenditure of public funds, and, although I so amended, the draft Bill as to reduce the probability of such expenditure to a minimum, they have been unable to withdraw their objection. They have, however, agreed, to the Bill dealing with Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries, which I now circulate.     This Bill, the purport of which is briefly summarised in the memorandum attached to it, does not involve any expenditure from the   . Exchequer or from the rates.
The&apos; failure of the Government, in spite of the promise given in the King&apos;s Speech of last session, to introduce legislation for Sea Fisheries will inevitably provoke hostile criticism from the representatives of that - by far the most * important - branch of the Fishing Industry, but, having regard to the financial circumstances of the time, and the view taken by the Treasury of the Bill, I have no alternative but to withhold it.     1 strongly urge, however, that the Bill which I here circulate should be Introduced, in order to meet the continued and pressing demand of Boards of Conservators, who, I may say, are receiving a large measure of support from numerous Angling Associations, which have an aggregate membership of at least some 600,000 working men.    I do not ask that the measure should be passed this session.    The point of chief importance iethat it should be Introduced, and thus made available for/criticism by the persons Interested.    It could then be re-introduced early next session with such amendments as may appear desirable,&quot;The terms of the Bill have been accepted by all Government Departments concerned., . A.?G. B.17th June, 1921.
MEMORANDUM.This Bill consolidates seventeen existing enactments relating to Salmon and Freshwater - Fisheries, enumerated in the Fourth Schedule.It also amends certain provisions of the existing law wherever doubts as to construction or practical experience indicate the necessity.With the exception of Clauses 23, 33, and 54, and the definition of the expression &quot; trout&quot; in clause 88, no new principle is involved in the Bill; but certain amendments of substance have been imported which have been incorporated in Provisional Orders made under the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act, 1907.Clause 23 extends the obligation to provide means for preventing ingress of fish into channels where they would be liable to destruction.Clause 33 provides for the compulsory registration of all dealers in salmon and trout,Clause 54 empowers fishery boards to institute proceedings under the Rivers Pollution Prevention Acts, 1876 and 1893, subject to the assent of the Minister of Health, and enables tidal waters to be declared a &quot; stream &quot; within the meaning of those Acts on fishery grounds as apart from sanitary grounds.The new definition of the expression &quot; trout,&quot; which is made to include all species of trout, whether migratory or non-migratory, has necessitated certain consequential amendments.So far as possible sections dealing with the same subject matter have been grouped together.The marginal notes indicate the sections of the existing Acts to which the respective clauses relate.   -The Bill has been agreed to by all Government Departments concerned, and it contains no provision which involves expenditure either from the Exchequer or from the rates.
