SECRETy,P,   So 64This Dociwent is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty&apos;3 Go eminent.)CABINET.PROCLAMATION OP EMERGENCYMEMORANDUM      THE   HOME SECRETARYiThe thii*fl Proclamation declaring an emergenoy under the Eme^genoy Powers Aot, 1980, and the Regulations made thereunder will cease to be in force after Sunday next the 86th June,    Before His Majesty is advised to issue another Proclamation for* the purpose of continuing the emergency powers, I think the question should be considered by the Cabinet.On the occasion of the last renewal of the Proclamation, it was argued by some Members of Parliament that a state of emergenoy no longer exists;   that the original Proclamation was issued in view of the fear of a strike of the Triple Allianoe, and that as this strike did not take plaoe and as there has been practically no disorder, there is no need for the exceptional powers conferred by the Emergency Powers Aot.*My own view is that it will be right to renew the Proclamation, The occasion of emergency contemplated by the Aot is aotion &quot;of such a nature and on so extensive a scale as to be calculated, by interfering with the supply and distribution of food, water, fuel, or light, or with the means of looomotion, to deprive the community, or any substantial portion of the community, of the essentials of life,rt The continued stoppage of work by the miners clearly comes within this provision.The Mines Department tell me it is quite impossible for them to oontemplate the lapse of the Declaration of Emergency so long as the coal stoppage continues.   It is from the Emergency Regulations that they derive their only powers of conserving and regulating the supply of coal, and the retention of these powers is, they say, absolutely necessary.Assuming that the Cabinet advise the issue   of another Proclamation, I think  the Emergency Regulations should be oontinued in the same form as before.As   the renewal of the Proclamation and the Regulations will have to be effected at a Council meeting to be held in the morning of Monday next, the  7th instant, I ask that the question may be considered by the Cabinet this week.E,So21.6. 218H0 7,
