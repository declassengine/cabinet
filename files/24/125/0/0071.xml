THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVKR^MKNT.CABINET.Draft Convention of the Washington International Labour Oonferenoe on the Regulation of Hours ofLabour.ST. 3069.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.I. I have recently circulated to the Cabinet two memoranda dealing with the Conventions adopted by the General Conference of tho International Labour Organisation, viz., CP.2970, in which are set forth the difficulties with regard to the 48 Hours Convention adopted at Washington in 1919, and CP.3068in whioh are submitted the recommendations of the International Labour Committee regarding the formal prooedure to be adopted by the Government to comply with their obligations under Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles.In view of the debate in the Houee of Commons on 27th May. I referre&quot;1 to the International Labour Committee, for further consideration, the particular question of the Hours Convention.    That Committee have now examined the question in detail and I submit, for the consideration of my colleagues the following conclusions.II. There appear to be three possible ways of dealing withthe Hours Convention -1. The Government might refuse to ratify and say, without entering into details, that while they cannot aocept the Convention, they would be prepared to consider the possibility of co-operating with other countries in preparing another less ln-elastio convention on the same subject for consideration at a future oonference.2, The Convention might be ratified, but with certain reservations whioh would have to be clearly and definitely indicated./s.. - 1. -6/646 a.
3. The Oorernment might refrain from ratifying, but might instead eend &amp; Tetter&quot; to&apos; tfensva expressing the desire to ratify and explaining the difficulties? adding that the Government would welcome reconsideration of the question at a future Oonferenoe of the International Labour Organisation.III. The first suggestion is that whioh I reoommended in C.P.2970 i,e, to announce that in the existing state of industry, tho Government are unable to give effect to the Convention and that in certain respeote the detailed precisions of the Convention would not be appropriate under any circumstances to conditions in thie country; but that, as there is by induetrial agreement in the United Kingdom general acceptance of the principle of a week of 48 hours or less, the Government will be prepared, when the opportunities of considering industrial legislation are improved by a return to normal oonditlons, to co-operate with the other nations who are parties to the International Labour Organisation in preparing another convention on the same subject.This suggestion has the advantage that it avoids all necessity for entering into details at the moment as to the amendments which would be necessary.    The matter would not come up for detailed consideration until the 1922 Conference at the earliest, by whioh time the probable return to more normal conditions might make less drastic amendments possible, Suoh a step does, however, amount practically to total rejection of the Convention; the dangers which such a course of action present are cabinet forth in detail in OoP.2970. and need not be repeated here.    On further consideration, I am deeply impressed by these dangers and feel that the other possible alternatives must be oarofully considered,IV, The second proposal is that the Government should ratify with certain reservations.    The Law Officers have given their/opinion
opinion (as set forth In C.P.3068) that in the oaee of a Draft Oonvention under Art.405 of the Peace Treaty, ratlfi-oatlon with reservations Is permissible; and the question of polioy involved in such a ratification with reservations must be considered.Such a oourse presente certain difficulties -(a) Thore ie a danger that if one Member of the International Labour Organisation ratifies with oortain reservations, other Members may follow Buit, with the result that the Hours Convention may speedily lose any claim to be considered as an international agreement.(b) The possibility of ratification with reservations was not apparently contemplated at the Peace Oonferenoe or when the Convention was adopted at Washington.(c) The International Labour Organisation may consider it inadmissible; and it is believed that the Director of tho Offioe has already expressedthis opinion,    On the other hand the Director has aa suoh no power to interpret Art,405, and also, it is believed that he ia anxious to secure the adhesion of Great Britain to the Hours Convention even subject to limitations.V.    It would be neoessary to make two main reservations(a) Railways^    It is impossible to maintainboth the principle of the Convention and the principle of the two railway agreements, to whioh the Railway Companies, the Ministry of Transport, and the Railway Unions attaoh great importance.Shortly, the aocepted Railway arrangement is an 8 hours day for 6 days a week with unlimited overtime on any one day at increased rates of pay ; and work on Sundays (sometimes three out of four) also at increased rates of pay.(b) Overtime arrangements generally.    In Engineering and other Industries the&apos; common arrangement by consent between employers and Unions is a 47 or 48 hour week, with praotioally unlimited overtime at the discretion of the employer, but subject always to higher pay at time-and-a-quarter or time-and-a-half, or other Inoreaeed rate.Such arrangements again are incompatible with the restrictions of the 7/ashington Convention.- ,3, -/If
422If tho Washington Convention is to he ratified with reservations, those reservations must be sufficiently widely drawn to permit of these existing arrangements as to overtime. On the other hand to ratify the Convention with reservations allowing all forms of overtime, and without any restriction on overtime working, would really lop off a large portion of the Washington Convention, and, further, would allow dangerous licence to our trade competitors whom it is our interest to bring up to the existing British practice as to the rogulation of overtime.I therefore suggest a reservation embodying thefollowing points(i) That, in accordance with the general British practice, as agreed between Employers and Unions, limitation of hours on the lines of the 48 hour week can be accepted.(ii) That subject always to the payment of higher rates (time-and-a-quarter or other increased rates) reasonable ovortiroe beyond the limited hours be allowed, and that generally the Washington limitation of overtime (other than increased payment) be not accepted.(iii) Further, I think it would be desirable to lay down that in any industry where no agreement exists between organised bodies of Employers and employed persons as to overtime; and where after enquiry the Government were satisfied that excessive overtime is worked, the Government after consultation with organised associations on both sides (or where there aro no such organisations, after such enquiry as the Ministry of Labour may think necessary) would make regulations to limit overtime.     This would go far to accept the general principle of the &quot;Washington Convention as to regulation of overtime, but on the other hand it may be urged that the requirement of increased rates of pay for overtime as in (ii) is the most effective restriction.VI.   A third proposal is to send a letter to Geneva expressingdesire to ratify the Convention but saying that as it hasbeen drawn up too rigidly to be applicable to conditions/in-*   4 a    -
423in this oountry (and, tt is believed, in other countries) it oannot bo accepted as it standB.     The letter might then indicate the general lines on which amendments are necessary analogous to tho reservations in Paragraph V above, without committing tho Government to rigid details.    It would be advisable to say definitely that these modifications,would not affect the last paragraph of Article 6, which lays down that all overtime shall be paid at time-and-a-quarter.VII. On consideration I should prefer not to adopt tho first suggestion, which amounts to total rojection.The third course leaves the matter more open, but will&quot;probably bo seized on by other countries, and by tho workers in Groat Britain as evidence that the Government is in effect deciding not to ratify without having the courage to say so.On the balance, therefore, I am inclined to favour the&quot;second course namely, ratification with reservations on the lines suggested.    But I feel it is a matter of such importance that the Cabinet must make the decision as to whioh is the proper course to adopt.VIII. My colleagues will remember that in the debate on May 27th, I made the offer (with the consent of the Leader ofthe House) to tho House of an opportunity for further discussion possibly on a motion for adjournment; July 1st hac now been given for the further discussion, and the Government policy should then I think be announced.(Sgd.)
