THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENTSECRET. M.H.36.C.Pc3047.CABINET.british Empire,Stat 1st^Conferences Memorandum by the Minister of Health.The main point arising out of the Report of the Committee appointed to consider the proposals of the British Empire Statistical Conference is whether an Imperial Statistical Bureau should be set up in London*   The majority oppose and the minority support.   The Idea seems to me sound enough In principle, but there may be some political embarrassment in practice, and the United Kingdom share of the cost, though small relatively, would nevertheless be an additional burden on the Exchequer at a time when every Department Is being told to reduce its expenditure on much more necessary services.   I should accordingly accept the view.of the majority, while suggesting that the subject Is one which will no doubt be discussed with the representatives of the Dominions.Ministry of Health.   M0ND.15.6.1921.
