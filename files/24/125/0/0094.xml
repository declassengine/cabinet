GENERAL.There has been no substantial increase in unemployment during the past week, but, failing an early termination of the coal stoppage, many firms, who have been retaining their employees in the hope that larger supplies of fuel will become available, will be compelled to adopt further restrictions in their working hours. Depression in the engineering and iron and steel trades continues, some firms having closed down owing to shortage of coal. Shipbuilding on the Clyde is slack, but there are signs of activity on the Tyne, Tees and Mersey. A revival in the cotton and woollen trades is anticipated when work in the mines is resumed. The improvement in the boot and shoe trade persists.II. EMERGENCY WORK.As announced by the Prime Minister on the 19th October, certain schemes have been put in hand by the Local Authorities in conjunction with the Ministry oi Transport and the Ministry of Health, and by the Local Authorities themselves, designed to secure work for unemployed men, preferentially ex-Service men. The following is the result at this date:  ,1(a.) New Arterial Roads.21,602 men employed up to date (in and around London, 3,288; Provinces, 18,314).(b.) Road Maintenance.It is estimated that employment has been provided for approximately 20,000 men over and above those ordinarily so employed.(c.) Housing (Acceleration of the Lay-Out of Roads and Sewers and Approved Housing Schemes).Men employed up to the 17th June, 2,601 (in and around London, 269; Provinces, 2,332).(d.) Lord St. Davids&apos; Committee.Men employed on work othen than the above up to the 17th June, 29,758 (in and around London, 4,794; Provinces, 24,964).(e.) Alternative Work in Government Establishments.War Office establishments: men employed up to the 18th June, 2,808 (in and around London, 2,051; Provinces, 757).Alternative work provided in Admiralty establishments: men employed up to the 18th June, 6,571 (in and around London, nil; Provinces, 6,571).(f.) Short-time in Government Establishments.Number of men who have found employment up to date as a result of the intro-duction of short-time system. Men employed up to the 18th June: War Office estab-lishments, 2,023 (in and around London, 1,884; Provinces, 139) ; Admiralty estab-lishments, 3,068 (in and around London, 191; Provinces, 2,877).(g.) Emergency Work found by Local Authorities.Total number of men employed up to the 17th June, 9,145 (in and around London, 3,251; Provinces, 5,894).Total labour employed on above schemes = 97,576.As-reports for the week ended the 17th June have been received from only 395 Local Authorities out of 420 who were asked to furnish information, it is probable that the Eelief Schemes which have been inaugurated by the Government and Local Authorities are finding employment for a number of men in excess of the figures given.[6512]
III. 50,000 EX-SERVICE MEN TO BE TRAINED IN THE BUILDINGINDUSTRY.The industrial stagnation caused by the coal stoppage, and the consequent uncertainty of the outlook, have seriously interfered with the progress of this scheme. The employers, however, have set up District Committees in many of the more important industrial centres, and it is understood that they will shortly be posting notices on all jobs advising their workpeople that the job is only open to men willing to work with and assist in the training of ex-Service men taken on under the scheme. This action has already been taken in London by the Master Builders and also by the Office of Works.In addition steps are being taken to make it clear that contracts for building and constructional work in which the Government is financially interested will in general be confined to contractors who are employing men under the conditions of the scheme.In the meantime the total applications are 19,164. In the London and South -Eastern Division 8,138 men have applied, and the following are figures for other Divisions: South Midlands and Eastern Counties, 1,351; South-Western Counties, 1,680; West Midlands, 1,990; Yorkshire and East Midlands, 1,638: North-Western. Counties, 2,475; Northern Division, 535; Scotland, 1,111; Wales, 246.IV.  PAYMENT OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT AND OUT-OF-WORKDONATION.1.
