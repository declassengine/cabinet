Accordingly, if the proposal to invite tenders&apos; should receive the sanction of the Cabinet, arrangements could not be made to bring into operation any agreement provisionally reached with a Steamship Company, until funds have been voted by Parliament on the Estimates for 1922/3 and the necessary Resolution of the House of Commons has been passed.   -In these circumstances it would- appear to Their Lordships to be desirable that opportunity should be taken in the meantime to obtain the considered views of the Imperial Shipping Committee on the general question at policy involved, -Their Lordships offer no objection to the form of tender proposed, and, subject to the necessary Cabinet approval, They are prepared to agree in principle that Parliament should be asked to make provision for this service in 1922/23, provided that reasonable terms can be arranged with&apos;a Steamship Company and that contributions, amounting to not less than one-fourth of the expenditure involved, can be obtained from the Colonies ooncerned,I amSir,Your obedient Servant, (Sa), CX.M8ST0W,
