[this Boctuneat is the Property of Em Britannic Majesty&apos;s Gaverni&amp;ent,]Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1921.SECRET.CP.-3079.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 20th instant.General State of the Country.Statistics of Outrages.The return of outrages for the week gives no indication of an improvement in the state of the country. Casualties to the Crown Forces numbered 40 (8 Police killed and 16 Police and 16 Military wounded) for the week, a decrease of only 1 on last&apos; week&apos;s total. Of the 8 Policemen killed, 3 fell in ambushes, 1 (a Special Constable) was shot in the course of the Belfast rioting on the 12th instant, and the remaining 4 were assassinated in cold blood. 1 while on his way to Church. Following one of these assassinations (that of a Constable near Dundalk) on the 17th instant, 2 Sinn Feiners who appear to have had no connection with this crime, were dragged from their home in Dundalk by armed men and shot dead. Thirty-nine ambushes were committed during the week, but the majority of these attacks were little more than sniping operations and resulted in no serious fighting. The only engagement on a large scale was an ambush of a party of Auxiliary Police which took place near Rathcoole, Newmarket District, co. Cork, on the 16th instant. The Auxiliaries, who numbered 25, were proceeding in four lorries from Banteer to Mill Street when three of the lorries were wrecked by the explosion of road mines, which were subsequently found to have been worked by means of electric wires at a distance of about 300 yards from the road. Immediately upon the lorries being put out of action the ambushers, who lay concealed behind the ditches which lined both sides of the road, opened a heavy rifle and shot-gun fire, and in the course of the engagement which followed 2 Cadets were killed and 4 wounded. Although the attacking force is believed to have been at least 300 strong, and the Auxiliaries were at a further disadvantage owing to the want of suitable cover, no attempt was made to attack at close quarters, and after an exchange of fire lasting about two hours the rebels withdrew, having probably suffered heavier casualties than those inflicted on the Auxiliaries. On the 18th instant a mixed party of Crown Forces who were attacked near Coolbawn, Castlecomer District,, co. Kilkenny, succeeded without loss to themselves in killing 1 and seriously wounding 2 of their assailants, and in capturing a quantity of arms and ammunition. In another encounter which took place the same day near Middown, Thomastown District, co. Kilkenny, 1 Constable was killed and 1 wounded. The rebels were driven off, leaving behind them 4 shot-guns, a revolver, and more than 200 cartridges.Five attacks on occupied Police barracks were made during the week, but resulted in no serious injuries to. the barracks or casualties to the garrisons. Two Courthouses (Wexford and Ravensdale, co. Louth), 1 vacated Police barracks (Sherry, co. Tipperary) and 5 Coastguard Stations (Skerries, Boughshinny, Rush, Rogerstown and Malahide, all in co. Dublin) were destroyed. In an unsuccessful attack made upon Teelin Coastguard Station (Killybegs District, co. Donegal) on the 12th instant, one of the Coastguards was shot dead, and in a raid upon the Coastguard Station at Courtown Harbour, co. Wexford, a number of lanterns and a -quantity of signalling apparatus were seized by the raiders.Eleven civilian murders, attributable to Sinn Fein, were perpetrated during the week, and 1 attempted murder.  The victims, included 6 ex-soldiers, an R.I.C.[6493]
Pensioner, and a Civil Bill Officer. A particularly brutal murder was that of Dean Finlay, of Swanlinbar, co. Cavan (an old man of 80 years of age), who was murdered at his own door by a band of armed and masked men, who then set fire to his house after turning his wife and servants out in their night attire.Other outrages for the week included 70 raids on mails and 3 raids for arms.Arrests for outrages and political offences numbered 34 for the week.Rioting in Belfast.The outbreak of party rioting in Belfast, which appeared to have subsided at the time of writing of my last week&apos;s report, commenced anew on the evening of the 14th instant, and continued intermittently throughout 4the following two days.. Sniping was indulged in freely by both sides and resulted in the deaths of 2 Unionists (1 an ex-soldier and the other a schoolboy aged 12) and 1 Nationalist (a girl of 19). Several Spirit Groceries owned by Roman Catholics were burned and looted, and a number of persons living in hostile localities were compulsorily evicted from their homes. By the evening of the 16th instant the city had again become comparatively quiet.Trials of Civilians by Court Martial.Seventy trials of civilians by Court Martial were concluded during the week, resulting in 58 convictions and 12 acquittals. The following is a summary of the sentences imposed: 27 sentences of penal servitude (3 years to 15 years, and 3 life sentences).22 sentences of imprisonment with hard labour (3 months to 2 years). 2 sentences of imprisonment without hard labour (6 months to18 months). 4 fines (51. to 100/.).3 sentences remitted by Confirming Officer. Total   58The 3 life sentences were for attempted murder. Sentences of 15 years&apos; penal servitude were imposed in the cases of 6 men convicted of unlawful assembly and of being found in possession of arms and ammunition, and sentences of 10 years&apos; penal servitude in the case of a man convicted of assault with firearms and in 2 cases of men found with arms and ammunition in their possession. Sentence of 5 years&apos; penal servitude was imposed for an assault with firearms upon a breadvan &quot;driver in Derry. The acquittals included the cases of 4 Constables of the Royal Irish Constabulary who were charged with robbery with violence and with attempting to obtain drink and tobacco from a publican without payment.Internment Orders.The following figures show the position as regards internments up to the 1.8th instant: jOrders made      ...         ...         ...         ...        ...     3,667Orders cancelled for reasons other than release       116 Releases ordered ...        ...         ...        ...       285        401Number of persons now interned    ...        ....        ...     3,266The number of appeals awaiting hearing is 24.State of the Police Forces.Recruiting for the Royal Irish Constabulary is again proceeding satisfactorily. Although the number of resignations and retirements&apos; is considerably above the average of recent weeks the net result of the week&apos;s recruiting is an increase of 94 in the strength of the Regular Force and an increase of 7 in the strength of the Auxiliary Division. The following are the usual particulars for the week:

Southern Ireland.In accordance with the Proclamation of His Excellency The Lord Lieutenant, issued on the 4th ultimo, the first meeting of the Southern Parliament will be held in Dublin on the 28th instant. Unless counsels of reason prevail at the eleventh hour the non-attendance of the whole body of Sinn Fein members of the Lower House, numbering 124 out of the total membership of 128 may be regarded as certain. As regards the Senate, returns have been received of the election of the 2 representatives of the Archbishops and Bishops of the Church of Ireland, the 16 representatives of the Southern Irish Peers and the 8 representatives of the Privy Council. Two of the last mentioned representatives, however, who appear to have been nominated without their consent, have signified their intention of not accepting election. Returns have not yet been received of the election of the 4 representatives of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy or of the 14 representatives of the County Councils, and it is presumed that the attendance of any representatives of these bodies is not to be looked for so long as the Sinn Fein members of the Lower House maintain their present attitude towards the Home Rule Act. Steps are being taken for the nomination of 17 representatives of Commerce, Labour and the Scientific and Learned Professions, as provided in Part II of the Second Schedule to the Act.Irish Office, SW.1, June 25, 1921,H.
