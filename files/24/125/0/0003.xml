GENERAL MILITARY SITUATION.There has heen no decrease in the number of snail ambushes and individual murders, but outrages on&apos;a large scale, except the attack on the Custom House, have net been attempted by the rebels during the week.     The efficiency of protective measures which have been gradually elaborated by both Troops and Police to meet existing conditions, is no doubt the reason fcr the diminution of big attacks.     The fact that ambushes on a large scale have not occurred does not necessarily mean that the rebels have not planned such outrages.In Dublin the principal event has been the burning of the Custom House by the rebels.     The building was not protected by a Military Guard, but is situated close to a Dublin Metropolitan Police Station.     The Door-Keeper and an unarmed Policeman were rushed by a party of about one hundred armed rebels who proceeded to pour petrol and oil on furniture, papers, etc., throughout the building and to set the place on fire.     Officials were threatened and one who tried to give the alarm was shot dead.     Two Auxiliary Companies R.I.C were quickly despatched to the scene.   These Companies surrounded the building and fired on a party of rebels attempting to escape, wounding or killing five.     The Auxiliaries worked very skilfully and it is believed that very few S- any of the rebels got away.   A large number of rebels were tracked down in the building, and either threw away their arms and surrendered or were shot,     Nearly 200 men and women finally walked out of the building with their hands up.     These were carefully sorted out, being put up at once for identification by the Custom House officials.     The result was that 111 men who could give no account of their presence or movements were arrested and are still in the hands of the Military Authorities. The Fire Brigade was prevented by rebel picquets from arriving at the scene as soon as they might have done, and was unable to cope with the fire.     The fire smouldered for some days   -and broke out again destroying a certain amount of stationery etc., which had been salved by Troops,     It was then found that the Fire Brigade was mt . seriously dealing with the situation, and it has-been found necessary to detail Troops/ to take charge of the hoses.In the Country there have been only minor actions, but a very prominent rebel, Moylan, was captured together with twelve of his foilewers at Kishkeam, County Cork,In an empty house at Progheda 89 firearms and a quantity of explosives v$3$ captured.   JSume very important documents have been captured, in Dublin and also in the 6th Divisional Area,HIS DQCUIOTT IS THE PROPERTT-OP HIS BRITJUELJXl KAXJBTY1 S GX)V1M3S[T.
