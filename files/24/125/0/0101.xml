.......,,  .   *mHDM3 . AWAJES   COMMITTBS.1-Jip97, Admiralty Pensions BilLMsnxirandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty?iI circulate herewith, for the consideration ofthe Horc-3 Affairs Committee, a draft &quot;Bill the principal provisions of which empower the Admiralty to allow the partial commutation of certain Unval pensions aril authorise the payment of pensions in forfeiture.   The former proposal is in accordance with-the recomendations . of the Jerram Committee and the Government are pledged -to give effect to it.   The latter proposal brings.pensions, administered by the Admiralty, into line with those administered by the Hirdstiy of Pensions.The Bill is not contentious and its financial &apos; considerations are inBinii.significant.   It has be-on approved by the Treasury^ and concurred in by the other Departments concerned, and I should be glad of the approval of the Hone, Affairs Committee to arrange for its introduction in the House&apos; cf Commons at an early date. - *(Intd.)    L, of P.June 29th, 1921.
Admiralty Pension s.MEMORANDUM.Clause 1 of the Bill empowers the Admiralty to commute the pension of a seaman or marine when awarded and administered by the Admiralty. It has been agreed with the Treasury that this shall he done on the same terms and under the same conditions as the pensions of soldiers are commuted. The pensions or retired pay of officers are already commutable under the Pensions Commutation Act, 1871, and the Jerram Committee recommended that this privilege should be extended to seamen and marines, subject to a minimum of Is. a day being reserved. This recommendation has been approved by the Government, subject to the minimum &quot;being 2.9., but the solicitor has advised that legislation is necessary to give effect to it in view of section 4 of the Naval and Marine Pay and Pensions Act, 1865, which prohibits the assignment or sale of a naval pension.Clause 2 of the Bill empowers the Admiralty to restore an Admiralty pension which has been forfeited under the Forfeiture Act, 1870, and further to pay or apply any part of the pension which has been restored to or for the benefit of the pensioner^ dependants, while he himself is undergoing imprisonment. This power has already been conferred upon the Minister of Pensions by section 7 of the War Pensions Act, 1920, in regard to pensions administered by him. Sub-clause 3 of this clause extends the same power to the Admiralty, War Office, Board of Trade, and General Post Office in regard to grants made by those Departments under the several Injuries in War (Compensation) Acts or the Government War Obligation Acts.Clause 3 of the Bill is necessitated by the conversion of the coast guard into a pensioner force. Previously a man serving in the coast guard was regarded as an active service rating and counted his service for pension under section 7 of the Coast Guard Service Act, 1865, but the regulations now provide that a member of the new force shall draw his pension in addition to his pay and, on the termination of his service, shall receive a gratuity in respect of his further service in the new force. If is necessary to provide accordingly that such time shall no longer count for an increase of his naval pension.43 -1 a
