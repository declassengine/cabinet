I desire the assent of the Cabinet to introduce a Bill in Parliament during the present session to effect certain changes in the administration of pensions, which should make for substantial economy.2*   Local War Pension Committees.   I propose to amend the War Pensions Acts so as to enable me to take under my direct control the work done (and the large expenditure,( 20,000,000) of public funds involved by it) in the local offices of the Local War Pension Committees throughout the Kingdom.Local Committees were set up by the War Pensions Act, 1915, throughout the United Kingdom for each County and County Borough, and for a large number of other areas, to administer discretionary assistance (either out of voluntary funds or with the aid of grants from the. Statutory War Pensions Committee) in cases of hardship arising among the wives and families ,of serving soldiers and sailors, or among men disabled by service in the present war, and the families of men killed in the wart   The Committees, which, with their Sub-Committees, now number 1,200, were intentionally made practically independent bodies, appointed by the Local Authorities of their districts and not subject to central audit or financial control. On the formation of my Department in 1917, their functions were extended and they were empowered by my predecessors to act as agents of the Department in a variety of matters for which a local office and agency were necessary, such as receiving and investigating claims for pension of all kinds, providing medical treatment, and paying allowances during treatment and training to disabled men.   With the progress.of the war and the increase of casualties, the work  and responsibility thrown upon Local Committees and Sub-Committees increased more&apos;than tenfold.   Their entire expenditure was now borne by the Ministry of Pensions, and it became necessary in 1918 to take power by the War Pensions Act of that year, to ,control their proceedings and expenditure so far as was practicable consistently with the semi-independent position enjoyed by them.   Powers of disallowance and surcharge of irregular expenditure, and of approval to the appointment of officers and of the conduct of business by the Committees, which were conferred upon the Minister by this Act have, however, proved generally ineffectual to safeguard expenditure of public funds.In 1916-17, the first year of their existence, liocal Committees expended  1,750,000,: mainly in occasional assistance to cases of hardship among the families of serving soldiers and sailors; their expenditure for the financial year 1920-21 amounted to over  20,000,000, of which practically the whole was. spent in supplementary allowances and grants to disabledmen
men, under the Royal Warrants or Regulations of my Department, and on the charges for the medical treatment of men In hospital,I am satisfied that I cannot, with due regard to sound and economical administration, continue to entrust so large a part of the routine work and of the expenditure of my Department to the Local Committees.   The Departmental Committee, appointed by me in November last to enquire into the machinery of pensions administration (which includes, in addition to five Members of parliament from all sides of the House, prominent representatives of Local Committees and &apos;Ex-Service Men&apos;s Associations) has unanimously reported in favour of a drastic change in the powers and functions of these Committees,   They have found that the Local Committees themselves are both unable and unwilling ta accept &apos; responsibility for the detailed work of investigation and payment of allowances which falls upon them under the Warrants and Regulations of the Ministry,   The work is left almost entirely to be carried out by the officers of the Committees, who are thus, placed in a position of irresponsibility which is not compatible with the proper administration of public funds,   In consequence, many instances of lax administration on.the part of committees and their officers, involving improper expenditure of large amounts have been discovered, and a very large number of cases of actual fraud on the part of officers have occurred,   My De-prtrtment is not, as things are, in a position to check effectively, either the current   administration of public money by the officers of the Committee, or to enforce economy of staff.In these circumstances, it Is urgently necessary to revise the powers of Local Committees and 1 desire, therefore^ to amend the War pensions Acts In the direction of(a) limiting the administrative powers of Local Committees to the functions which they were originally set up by parliament to perform, viz. the giving of discretionary assistance In cases cf hardship out of voluntary funds or on behalf of the Special Grants Committee; while, at the same time,(b) constituting them bodies to hear and make representations to the Ministry in regard to cases which, from local knowledge, they may consider not to have been adequately dealt with by the Regional Offices of the Ministry.In making these changes, I have had in view the analogy of the Local Employment Committees in relation to the Employment Exchanges, and I propose, In defining the powers of Local Committees, to assimilate them closely with those of the Local Employment Committees.,At the same time, I desire to take power to re-organise the local areas of administration, so as to reduce the number of&apos; these areas and of the Local Committees to one-third of their present number, at most and to take into the direct employ of the Ministry those of their principal officers and staff who may be found essential for carrying on the local work of my Department.   At the present time, the staff of Local War Pension Committees numbers 6,700, whose salaries are entirely paid out of public funds. By a re-organisation of the areas and a reasonable economy of staff, I am advised that this staff could be reduced byat
at least one-third, with a consequent saving of at least  300.-000 annually out of the o-ne-and-a-half millions which represent the present cost of administration of Local Committees.Moreover, by assuming direct control of the work which must be done in local offices, I shall be in a position to put an effective stop to lax or excessive expenditure on allowances and grants, and to bring about a sounder administration.3,   Permanent^ Pens ions.   The Associations of Ex-Service ken&apos;haVeTor&quot;many months past pressed upon me the desirability of securing finality in the award of pensions, in order to avoid the constant medical&apos; re-examination of disabled men.   I have given very careful consideration to the methods by which this can be achieved with advantage both to disabled officers and men and to the State.   Under the present Warrants, a permanent pension may be awarded as soon as it is found, medically, that a disabled man&apos;s condition is final and stationary; but once a permanent pension is awarded, it cannot be reduced,, however much the man&apos;s condition may improve, although it may be increased if at any time his condition grows worse. Under such conditions, the award of permanent pensions is financially impracticable, except on a very small scale and in those cases only (chiefly amputation cases) where it can with practical certainty,be foreseen that no increase of the disablement is likely.   On the other hand, unless pensions can be made permanent, the present large and costly machinery of Medical Boards and clerical staff must be maintained indefinitely - a prospect which is not to the advantage of pensioners or of the State.   It is clear, therefore, that if permanent pensions are to be awarded on any, large scale, the one-sided condition by which a permanent pension can be reviewed to the advantage of the man only, must be reconsidered.. Careful investigation has been made of the results of the examination of disabled officers and men by Medical Boards since the beginning of the war, and I am advised that there is a constant decline in the average degree of disability on which pension is based as time elapses after a man&apos;8 discharge from service; the decline is rapid at first, but gradually diminishes, and in the case of men invalided from military service, Sir Alfred Watson, the Chief Government Actuary, concludes that &quot;after about four years from the grant of pension,- a stationary condition is at any rate in sight in the great majority of cases&quot;.   This is well illustrated by the chart attached to this Memorandum, which shows the progressive decline in the rates of disability assessment each year after discharge.   In the case of men-jderaoj^fjlsed since the Armistice (who are entitled to claim peZsTorTfor any disability or impairment attributable to or aggravated by their previous war service) the improvement in their condition is, as might be expected, even more rapid than in the case of men Invalided on account of their disability from the Army, and in their case a stationary condition will in most cases be reached a good deal earlier than four years after discharge from service.After
After careful coneiteration of the data put before me, and In agreement with the Treasury and the Chief Actuary, I&apos;propose to take power to make a final award of pension or gratuity wit h finn11ty of asses ament aa ajainst both the man and tEe, State,&quot; In the case of all men who are&quot;still on temporary pension four years after their discharge (If such an award has not been found possible earlier).   The final award will, of course, take full account of any prospective improvement in the man&apos;s condition, which the class of disability from which he is suffering, ordinarily shews.   The award will be subject to the usual right of appeal to a Medical Appeal Board of the Ministry within a time limit of one year after the decision of the Medical Board.I have reason to believe that final awards on these lines will be acceptable to ex-service men.Final awards can be made in 80$ of the cases on the present pension list within the next three years.   This procedure will have the effect of reducing very rapidly the costly machinery of Medical Boards and of the staff of my Department, and, further, should result in a substantial saving on the cost of pensions,   I anticipate that by the time the bulk of the present pension list has been dealt with by &quot;&quot;ft final award, the annual saving on the Vote of my Department should (on a conservative estimate) be rat&amp;er over five millions, which&apos;is made up of three-and-a-quarter millions on the cost of .pensions and one-and-three-quarter millions on the cost of administration.Final awards on these lines will, however, be productive of considerably greater&apos;saving in the long run, since they will prevent subsequent increases in the rates of pension as age and the conditions of civil life and work reduce the pensioner^ physical powers, and may be claimed to have increased the effects of his. war disability,,   It is, therefore, most important that final settlement should be secured at the present moment while it is still possible to measure the compensation properly due to the man&apos;s war injury as distinct from other conditions, the effect of which it will, be impossible to discount at a later date,1 think it possible that there may be a demand that final and permanent awards made by the Ministry should be subject to a right of appeal to an independent tribunal or board, particularly in vie1.? of the fact that the men are losing their present right to come back on the Ministry for increased pension if their disability should grow worse. Such a right of appeal would be in accordance with the recommendations of the Select&apos;Committee on Pensions (1919). I ask the assent of the Cabinet to provide for such a tribunal, if I am seriously pressed in the House in this direction, on the understanding that all possible safeguards in the interests of the State are provided for,4&apos;   Time Limit to fresh claims for pension from disabled menT   Under Article 9 &quot;of Lthe preselrPWarfants, officers and men who have served in the late war may, at, any time in the future, put forward a claim to pension on the ground of a disability alleged to have been sustained, or even only aggravated, by their war service.   There is already considerable difficulty in obtaining satisfactory evidence, or indeed any real evidence at all, as to the connection 
connection between the disability which the man claims and his war service, and this difficulty will necessarily increase with the lapse of time since the man&apos;s discharge or demobilisation.   This is specially the case in regard to diseases.   A man&apos;s life and conditions of work after his discharge may bring out latent diseases or incapacities of various kinds, and It will become Increasingly difficult to refute the mnn&apos;s claim that these disabilities were induced by his war service, especially if there is any evidence in his military history that he suffered at any time from them during his service.   A time limit to fresh claims for pension Is a necessary corollary to ray proposal for making final and permanent awards of pension or gratuity, and will be of direct advantage and economy to the State, since it will enable the machinery of Medical Boards and of the Awarding Staff of my Department to be brought to an end within a measurable time.In making the suggestion of a time limit, I have the support of the Advisory Committee on Pensions of the Labour Party, and of foreign systems of pension, such as the French and American,I propose to fix the time limit at s^even^eajrs^ from the date of the man tSi discharge or demob^K^fon&apos;Vi;qr[ ffijl, JBJI 2l S ,    f &quot;l^otiever is &quot;earlier, *&apos; ,5, Minor amendments to the War Pensions Actsu I propose to make, ai the same time,&apos; a few amTn^ments on minor matters to the War Pensions Acts, such as:-(l) power to commute pensions of seamen on the same lines as already apply to pensions of soldiers:(2) power to assume the custody of the orphan child of an officer or man killed in the war, who may have been adopted by, and be under the control of, a Board of Guardians;(3) amendment of Section 8 of the War Pensions Act, 1919, dealing with the right of appeal to a Pension Appeal Tribunal, including the Imposition of a time limit to such appeals.6,   I ask for urgency In the consideration of these proposals in order that this legislation which is absolutely necessary if serious economies are to be realized in the near fixture, and which I have every reason to expect will meet with the general agreement of the House, may be. obtained during the present Session,IAN MAC PERSON, H June, 1921,
