PROCEDURES GOVERNING BILLS WEIGH INVOLVE CHARGES,On tho 28th February last,   Sir ^onald Maclean asked the then Loader of the House what action the Government proposed to take in regard to the recommendations of the Select Committee, and Mr, Sonar Law gave the following answer&quot;I have examined the recommendations of the &quot;Committoe and I think it would be doclrablo to adopt &quot;them.    I   am having inquiry made as to the stops &quot;which it would be necessary to take for that &quot;purpose.&quot;In view of this answer we felt that we were precluded from raising objections,   except on points of detail, to the acceptance of all or any of the Select Committee*s re-commendations and that we were bound to report upon the steps which it would be necessary to take to give effect to each of them.    But at the same time we think it will assist the Cabinet in arriving at a conclusion if we indicate the criticisms which have been directed against certain of these recommendations and the special difficulties which are likely to ariso in carrying them out.It will be convenient to consider the recommendations as to Public Bills and Private Bills separately.PUBLIC BILLS. With regard to Public Bills the proposals of the Select Committee   are as followst^^ ^bat every B511 which involves charges Jipon the Rates shall have bound up with it a statement showing the probable c cfi&quot; r to the t R^ovy-yere^.To give effect to this recommendation a new Standing
Order will apparently have to be passed &quot;that no Bill &quot;Imposing any charge either upon taxes or rates should &quot;be proposed for Second Reeding unless it contained a &quot;Memorandum setting out the capital and annual cost &quot;according to an estimate.&quot;     (Mr. Lowther, Q. 217).   In the case of Government Bills a Circular from the Treasury to the Departments will also be required,A modification of the Committee^ recommendation is necessary whore a Bill is introduced dn a Financial Resolution and consequently a White Paper has to be issuod in connection with that Resolution before the text of the Bill Is issued *    In that case the rate estimate should be included in the separate White Paper issuod for the Resolution before the Bin is presented.(2)   That any clausestwhichjaXfect the Ratepay&amp;v8 shall be scored in the margin or otherwise distinguished in some manner approved by Mr. Speaker.This recommendation can be carried out by means of a direction given by Mr. Speaker.  A standing Oj*der is not necessary.(3) (l) In the case of   Public Bills promoted by Private Members, that if such a Bill obtains a Second Reading, the appropriate Department shall, within seven days, , examine and; report upon the, financial Statement attached to the Bill;   and further, that no proceedings   be taken in the House *   Q  **V a Standir^ Committee; thereof, upon the ftatlng Clauses of, the Bj 11 muntil such Report has been issued,A new Standing 0rder will be noeded to give effect to these recommendations.The Ministry of Health and the Scottish Office&quot; point out that Private Members1 Bills are often not circulated until a day or two before the Second Reading
and that accordingly the 7 days proposed Is too short a time.     It is obviously useless to ash Departments to report on an estimate unless they are given reasonable time, and we therefore suggest that an interval of at-least 10 days should be required between the circulation of the Bill and Second Heading.(ii) Inra the^ case of i ai Goyermientt BiI\ ^iposlng charges upon^Ratest as wellas Taxes the discussion and decision relative to the Rate charge,should be taken with the charge upon the Exchequer in the;usual Financial S solution! both in^ Committee and upon the Report Sta^e. A new Standing Ordor will be needed.(iii) In thejoase of JjQverm\ent^ Bills where the charges fall only upon the Rates a Financial Resolutionsj^ould^bjs JSEy^^E^H^EMM^ 0:T .fr9 T^ois Hguga subsequent-toSecond Reading,&apos;but the Report Stage thereon should be purely formal and should- not a dm it of any debate.^ Jj?o economise time the Report Stags pf this Financial Resolution might follow thejieport ftpm]jthe^Committee- of the whole House upon the same daj.A new Standing Order will be needed.On the question of an actual Financial Resolution in regard to rates as distinct from a White Paper /estimate the Treasury evidence was against the proposal.    It was-objected by the Treasury that &quot;rates are not public moneys &quot;in the parliamentary sense, and a parliamentary Financial &quot;Resolution which would lead up to a Parliamentary charge &quot;on the public revenue is not the proper engine for &quot;authorising charges on rates.     It would be particularly &quot;inappropriate in the case of a permissive Bill which &quot;leaves it to the Local Authority to decide whether to &quot;charge the rates or not;   and it would be anomalous to&quot;introduce a Resolution here and not in the case of charges-&quot;on rates arising from other Bills&quot;.
arginal notes &quot;Mr, WebsterOn this point too there was a difference of opinion between the former and the present Speaker (&apos;43.223-5, 281, 288-9), and Mr, whitley described the proposed extra stage as a false remedy.Further,.the proposal to take the He port stage of a Financial Resolution on the same day as the Committee stage in tho caso of Rates Resolutions (but not in other cases) is an innovation in procedure which might be a very undesirable precedent for hasty financial legislation,It will bo seen that the recommendations of the Committee in regard to Public Bills involve Resolutions to alter the Standing Orderbut no legislation.The Clerk of the House of Commons has been consulted as to the Standing Order which would be needed in the case of Public Bills, and he has suggested that it might takethe case of ivernment Bills,finite Paper re-the following form:-ting to publiciney is issued by ;re-inforcement or ar-ngement. Should it the statement fixed to the 11 be made ll^explanatory as in e case of un-ficial members&apos; Us?6   If not, ther than a vernment Bill&quot; ould be in-Hed after bill line 1, It ia pointed out the Treasury it It is the jular practice issue a White l?er for a Govern-it Bill8s liancial resolu-pn and they fcgest therefore ft the words flier than a procedure floverninf, Bills involving charges on Rates,Proposed Standing Order.(1) In the case of a public bill by which a charge is, or may be, imposed on any local rate, other than a bill to confirm a provisional order, the member or members, in charge thereof shall cauee to be issued with the bill as first printed by order of the House&quot;a statement showing the effect of, and an estimate of the cost involved in, the passage into law of any such proposals.

Such a resolution shall not be considered by the House on the same day as that on which the resolution has been agreed to in the Com-mittee unless the House shall have so ordered by a motion made after notice given.(5) Ihere a Government bill involves or may involve a charge on or expenditure out of any local rate in addition to expenditure out of public money, the resolution required for the purposes of this Standing Order may be moved as part of the resolution moved in the Committee of the whole House appointed under Standing Order No,71 for the purposes of the Bill, if the motion setting up that Committee shall have defined the charges affecting rates as well as those affecting public money, provided that nothing in the Standing Order shall be deemed to make the recommendation oi the Crown necessary for such part of the resolution as affects rates.(4) A bill shall be deemed to impose a charge on the rates for the purposes of this Standing Order if the proposals of the bill involve expenditure which may have to be defrayed out of the produce of any local rate whether * rate is proposed to be levied by the
PRIVATE BILLwS. The recommendations of the Committee in regard to Private Bills also involve the alteration of theStanding Orders, and on certain points legislation, as well.Scottish Private Legislation is carried out by Provisional Order under the Private Legislation Pro-cedure (Scotland) Act, 1699, unless in exceptional cases where the Chairmen direct that Orders shall proceed as Private Bills,   We use the expression &quot;Private Bill&quot; as covering Provisional Orders under the Scottish Act and where a reference is made to a Standing Order it will be understood to cover the corresponding General Order under that Act (if any).(1) The Committee recommend that in the case ofPrivate.....Bills^ as well as Public Bills, any Clauses which affect the Ratepayers should be scored in the margin or otherwise disntln^ul8hedi in some manner approved by Mr^Speak^r.Effect can be given to this by a new standing order.It is pointed out, however, by the Ministry of Health and the Scottish Office that Private Bills are printed by the promoters and not by the Parliamentary authorities, they are not circulated as Publio Bills are to the members generally, and in view of the procedure upon Private Bills already in existence, it Is difficult to see how there could be any advantage in specially dis-distinguishing clauses affecting the rates.  A large pro-portion of the clauses in many Private Bills promoted by local authorities would be of this character,(2) That every Private, Bill shall have pound up with it a statement showing; the probable cost to the ratepayers.This would need a new Standing Order,6.
The Ministry of Health and the Scottish Office criticise this recommendation.   They point out that Private Bills are now required to be deposited on or before the 17th December&quot; -(Standing Order 32) but the estimate of capital expenditure and the statement of statistical particulars with respect to the district need not be deposited until the 31st December* (Standing Order 36/0, &amp;nd they suggest that the statement of the probable cost to the ratepayers, which the Select Comnlttee recommend, should accompany the estimates and statistical statement,   This could be done by a new Standing Order to follow 37 in the following form (suggested by Sir Albert Gray and Sir Ernest Moon).-Suggested new ;Standing Order to follow 37^ both Houses&apos;,)&apos;On or before the 31st day of December*estimates of the probable charges both capital andannual which are likely to fall on the ratea of any country or borough or district in the event of the passing; of the Bill shall be deposited at the PrivateBill Office and at the office of the Ministry of Health.   The estimates shall specify the charges in respect of each of the purposes for which powers involving charges on the rates are sought by the Bill and shall be in such a form as may be prescribed by the Minister of Health.&apos;3)    That the notices of the Bill priory to the statutory meet in-- under the Boror^h Funds Act.,.^houldjO r^ain^a Statement showing the financial effect of the Jpaaoinfi of the Bill. &apos;/ 1This would need legislation:   effect to the proposal* Under the Scottish Procedure Act, December an*i April.
could be given by ft short Bill amending Rule 1 in the Plrat Schedule to the Borough Funds Act, 1903.(4)   The Committee also recommend that the Stand. i ng grders should be so amended that the^otice must^incIjode an estimate of the charge s,n froffi^pffiitai ancl, annual, wh ich would^ be laid upon the Ratepayers, as well aa the ,90 ri\ 0** promoting theu be  1^The Committee apparently contemplated an amend-ment of Standing Order No. 3*   It is doubtful, however, whether thio would be necessary if the previous recommenda-tlon is adopted.The further proposal that the notice should include an estimate of the coat of promotion of the Bill is based on Mr. WhitleyVs evidence.   Such an estimate would have to be framed or two suppositions (a) that the Bill will be opposed and (b) that It will be unopposed, and any such estimate might be most misleading.(5)   That if at the Statutory Public Meeting there are present, and opposed to a Bill, not less than 20 electors, and if Subsequently a Petition against the Bill is-presented by 100 electoror one-twentieth in number of the electors, whichever may be the less, this minority shall be eligible for a locus stand! against a Billpro-promoted under the Coztmon Seal..This proposal is a considerable change in Private Bill procedure, and It appears to be open to criticism on two grounds, via. (a) that it may Involve some risk, of wealtening the sense of responsibility of the local authority and of the ratepayers as a whole, and (b) that the locus to oppose should depend on the magnitude of the Interest involved rather them on the were number of opposing electors.   It will be noted that the minimum number of electors to whom the locua is recommended to
be given is the same as that required for a demand for a poll of the electors under the Borough Funds Act, 1905, upon the question of the promotion of the Bill, and it would seem that in any event the locus to oppose should only be given in cases where the electors have exercised their right to demand a poll.r&quot;e are further of opinion that the requirement as to the number of electors joining in the Petition should not be insisted upon.    Tho fact that 100 electors are required to demand a poll seems to us a sufficient safeguard against frivolous opposition.     It is in cases In which the ele ctorate is large that schemes involving large expend it ire are most likely to occur;   and if the signature of 100 electors were required the formalities prescribed by the Parliamentary Rules and. Orders would make the deposit of &quot;such a Petition difficult and expensive, and the right to petition might thus become a dead letter.Sir Albert Gray and Sir Ernest Moon have suggested the following new Standing Order to give effect to therecommendation of the Committee amended as above proposedSuggested new St andIns Order to follow 105 D (House of &quot;   Hs-TJ:3lMal?Jn^irE&quot;^cuse oTHDommons ) T&quot;Where in the case of a Bill promoted bythe Council of a Borough or Urban District inEngland and Wales a poll has been required and taken with respect to any resolution put to ameeting of electors under the Boroush Funds Acts1872 and 1903, it shall be competent to the refereeson Private Bills (in the House of Lords for the SelectCommittee to whom the Bill is referred), if they think fit to admit petitioners being electors or ratepayersto be heard against the Bill or such parts or clausesthereof as were referred to in the resolution.&quot;
It is to be observed that the Committee1a re-commendation applies only where the consent of the electors is required to the resolution for the pro-motion of the Bill&apos;.   In the case of Bills promoted by County or Rural District Councils or Joint Boards, bodies to .which the Borough Funds Acts do not apply, we think that some analogous rights can hardly be withheld.   As the electors are not consulted in these cases we suggest that admission as petitioners might be given to dissentient ratepayers in cases where the Council or Board was not unanimous in the promotion of the Bill and where It seems desirable that the dis-sentienta should be heard before the Committee,   If this suggestion is adopted effect can be given to it by a separate Standing Order or by the addition of a paragraph to the new Standing Order set out above.The provisions of the Borough Funds Acts re-lating to the consent of owners and ratepayers do not apply to Scotland and in other respects these Acts have only a partial application.   Any steps therefore to be taken to carry out the proposal as regards Scottish Provisional Orders would imply a further extension of the Acts to Scotland,   Legislation would of course be necessary for this purpose.This observation applies also to the proposal numbered (3) above.That if by such a Petition the Bill, or portions of it, are rejected by the Committee to whom the Bill is referred, the successful petitioners may be awarded the taxed costs of their opposition from themmmmwmtmi m* &apos;vit-      -  i   - mini m i(rr mm mmmst\fr r u www - n* tmnwmtm wxwww wmmVmpm fmmm.....n in in m **i****t,,.m-**-^&apos;**n mmtmH m.promoters, and similarly taxed coats may be awarded agfli nst unsuccessful petitioners.This will involve ar.   amendment of the 10.
Parliamentary Costs Act, 1665.     But if this Act is to be amended, it is questionable whether the amendment could fairly be limited to the particular case of dissentient ratepayers.    Mr. Lowther (Q. 213) said that he did not see why Committees should not have the same general powers over costs as are exercised by the Courts, and there appears to be a general opinion that the Act of 1865 is unduly res-trictive and requires to be relaxed.Tie should.add with regard to Scottish Provisional Orders, that Commissioners have not the powers at present possessed by Private Bill Committees to award costs and an amendment of the Act of 1899 would appear to be necessary to give them that power.&quot;;iKNPAL ESTIMATE OF R^TB EXPENDITURE.-The Select Committee recommended &quot;that the estimated &quot;Rate expenditure for the year shall bo included in any &quot;memorandum issued by the Chancellor of the Exchequer before i &quot;the Budget.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchecuer publishes no memorandum before the Budget.     A memorandum on the  1stimates by the Financial Secretary is published, and there is also the Financial. Statement, mere statistics, published with the Budget.    The beet place for a statement of rate expendi-ture is the latter.     The Ministry of Health and the Scottish Office have, however, pointed out that it is impossible in April of any year to give figures of the estimated rate expenditure of that year.    The Local Authorities as a rule do not settle their estimates until April (in Scotland not until Autumn) and in many cases in England the estimate is for six months only.     Consequently, the material for the current year Is not available in time for insertion In the Financial Statement.   It is, however, possible to give a figure of the. estimated rate expenditure of the previous year, and it was.11.
accordingly decided to Insert this figure in the presentyear!s Financial Statement following on the figures of Exchequer Issues of the previous year..It will be observed (1) that certain of the Committee&apos;srecommendations involve legis-lation;(2) that certain others involve new Standing Orders in one or other House,    (Such changes in Standing Orders would need to be moved by Government Resolutions and would probably lead to debate).,(3) that other recommendations (e,g. inclusion of estimates of rate costs in White Papers) can be carried out at least to a large extent administratively.
