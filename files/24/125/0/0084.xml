This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.,,,SECRET.CP. 3082.    *   ; fttl -    ^ - ^&apos;   THE CABINET.INTERNMENT OF IRISH REBELS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The Cabinet decision of 2nd June (Cabinet 47 (21), Conclusion (3)), that, as a matter of policy, the Irish internees should continue to be interned in Ireland, has been communicated to the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief the Forces in Ireland, who has strongly urged that the matter should be reconsidered.The difficulties which attend the provision of additional internment camps in Ireland have already been brought to notice in my previous memorandum (OP. 2996), and I would again emphasize the fact that, owing to the absence of civilian labour and the demolition of all the war hutted camps in Ireland, the necessary hutted accommodation for the winter would take from 6 to 12 months to erect, and would cost, approximately, 300,000/.The present internment camps are full to overflowing, and every day large numbers of men are being admitted; and if Martial Law is proclaimed over the 26 counties, owing to the failure of the inhabitants of Southern Ireland to form a Parliament, the number of persons to be interned may amount to 8 or 10 thousand.The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief has already been obliged to order the erection of a separate cage for extremists outside the ordinary prison camp at Ballykinlar at a cost of between 4,000/. and 5,000/., and of a tented camp for 5,000 at the Curragh, as to which he says that, apart from the actual construction of the camp and barbed wire fences, the instalment of the external electric lights system will take at least 3 months, and the necessary plant will have to be sent from England. By the time, therefore, that the camp is in good working order, the period during which tents can be used will be passing. In any case, to keep the internees under canvas will certainly give rise to increased complaints, rebel propaganda and Parliamentary criticism.Further, the presence of large numbers of internees in Ireland adds to the unsettled atmosphere there, and is a constant source of irritation, which would, General Macready thinks, be allayed if they were removed from that country, where the conditions only serve to encourage them in their attitude of rebellion. Hardly a week passes without attempts to escape and, in the event of success, the fugitives find themselves at once among a friendly population, so that it is almost impossible to recapture them.Most important of all is the fact that the guarding of internment camps in Ireland requires far more troops than would be the case in England, and the effect of a large number of the reinforcements which it is proposed to send to Ireland will be neutralized by their being occupied on guard duty. General Macready is entirely ready to agree that the troops necessary for guarding internees in England should be deducted from those earmarked for service in Ireland.In my previous memorandum I suggested that Portland Prison might be made available for Irish internees. But the numbers mentioned by General Macready would, in any case, require additional accommodation, and it would be necessary to provide a hutted camp, preferably at Catterick. General Macready strongly advises that the internees should all remain under military control and, in that case, whether Portland Prison can be used or not, additional military personnel would be needed to maintain, cook and perform other similar duties for these prisoners, as well as bedsteads, bedding, crockery, &amp;c. All this would be very expensive, though the expense would be less if civil prison accommodation were available. General Macready has recently suggested that the Admiralty might provide up to six out-of-date battleships or large cruisers with nucleus crews for internment purposes two to be anchored off Dublin and one in
Belfast Lough to begin with. He can provide the necessary guard. Another suggestion has been made that hutted accommodation is available at Scapa, to which internees could be taken by sea, and where maintenance arrangements might be made by the Admiralty.It is important to remember that the Law Officers have advised that Irish internees can only be detained in England under Regulation 14b of the Defence of the Realm Regulations, which will expire on the statutory date for the conclusion of the war. In the opinion of the Law Officers; Regulation 14b of the Restoration of Order in Ireland Regulations is ultra vires, so far as it purports to authorize internment and treatment as a prisoner of war outside Ireland. If, therefore, the statutory date for the conclusion of the war occurs before Ireland is pacified, and unless fresh legislation is passed, any Irish internees in England must then either be released or returned to Ireland; and if accommodation in Ireland is not available, as during the winter it would not he, release and the undoing of the work of months would be the only possible course.L. W.-E.25th June, 1921.
