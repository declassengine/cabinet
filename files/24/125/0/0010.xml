Unfortunately, the branches are controlled by extremists.Some of the leaders are inclined to discuss the question of wages with the owners.   The majority of the rank and file are concerned only with wages and are indifferent to the National Pool.Good order in the coalfields has been maintained.There are crises in the engineering, cotton and woollen textile industries owing to threatened wage reductions; meetings are, however, still in progress between employers and employed.The cotton workers1 notices expire on Saturday, while the engineers&apos; reductions are to start on June 16th.Unemployment continues to increase.The Communists are still suffering from the effects of recent arrests and are endeavouring to make the &quot;release of political prisoners&quot; a plank in the miners&apos; platform.
sag     mihsrsThe miners and-owners accepted an invitation from the Government to a conference on May 27th and met again the following day.    The Government suggested terms which covered a temporary settlement for a period of three months, during which the difference between the wage based on the economic capacity of the mines and the money actually received by the miners should be met by a Government grant of  10,000,000 and the surrender of the owners profits.    It was also suggested that the disputants should submit to arbitration for a settlement which should be binding for twelve months.    Miners and owners have referred these proposals to their districts:   in the case of the former, there are indications, of overwhelming opposition, due largely to a mistaken belief fostered by untrue statements that arbitration would be compulsory.    Owing to the influence of communists an agitation has also been started to make the release of &quot;political prisoners&quot; a preliminary to the resumption of work in the coalfields.The only question about which the great majority of miners are concerned is pay, and thousands say &quot;What we want to know is how much we are going to lose per shift,&quot;    There are signs that some of the miners&apos;leaders are prepared to discuss wages with the owners and it is probably on these lines, especially if wages can be related to the cost of living that a solution can be reached,    The orderly conduct of the miners has been maintained and most of them would welcome a return to work:   indeed, a secret ballot would show a large majority in favour,of resuming, but unfortunately extremists control the machinery,On Hay 3rd the Associated Society of locomotive Bnginemen and Ifiremen removed the embargo on imported coal and a similar step has now been taken by the National Union ofRailwayman/
Railwayman and the Transport Workers&apos; Federation:   these decisions will hare considerable moral effect on the miners.Glasgow dockers have begun to trickle back and it is possible that their strike will soon come to an end.TOfB reductionsThe general opinion among engineers in the Midlands is that the terms offered by the employers, unless modified, will result in a strike.    The looal branch officials advise strong resistance to the proposals and owing to the short time, which has been worked for several months, the feeling is bitter.    The reductions proposed are 15/ll per week for skilled workers, 14/- for semi-skilled and 13/-forunskilled and it is contended by the men&apos; that if they accept these reductions they will be paid less than unskilled men:   it will be remembered that for some time there has been discontent at the disparity between the wages received by the dockers and general workers and those paid to the engineers.From Newcastle also my Correspondent reports that a strike is probable unless the terms are revised, or submitted to a Court of Enquiry,     Over 1,250,000 workers are concerned.The woollen textile workers, whose wages this yearhave been reduced by about 40 per cent in accordance withthe sliding scale agreement, are faced with the proposal of further reductions, amounting to17/- and 17/8i for men time workers10/4$ &quot;   women 11       &quot;18/lf &quot;  men pieceworkers12/7 &quot;  women       1122/lJ IJ   overlookers.The National Association of Unions in the Textile Tradesdecided at the meeting in Bradford last week, at which250,000 operatives were represented, to reject theseproposals.The/
IM      fP     in the notices given by the cotton trade operatives expire on Saturday next, but negotiations are in progress and a further meeting will be held to-morrow.TEE. C QMUH IS T3During the week the communists have devoted their attention to attempts to impede a settlement of the mining crisis by introducing demands for the release of communist prisoners:   in the words of one of their organisers &quot;the tactics we are adopting now is that no negotiations shall take place until the political prisoners are released and if A.J. Cook gets sentenced the rest of the South Wales chaps on E.C. will refuse to sit with the other worms.1&apos;    The measure of communist effort in this connection may be gauged from the fact that although Herbert Smith has privately expressed great pleasure at the removal of revolutionary obstructionists in his own-area, he was forced to protest against the prosecutions at the recent meeting with the Government.Evidence as to the effect of recent prosecutions continues to accumulate and there is no doubt that the communist movement h&amp;s suffered a severe check.    Increasing caution is the keynote of extremist speeches, moderate supporters are re-considering their attitude and audiences - are decreasing.The I-ondon Organisation Committee of the Communist Jarty, which consists of P. D&apos;Aprano, Mrs. DTAprano, A. ,Sifleet, H.W. Inkpin, 1*. Tanner, H. Morley, A. Squair, , A.E. Hawkins, W,H. Eyde, R. &apos;j?&amp;ge Arnot, E. Vfalmesley, A.J. 3D.ein, Miss Smythe, - A.E. Newton, G. Deacon, chairman, and Ernest W. Cant, secretary, has just drawn up a constitutional report from which the following extracts are taken:,&quot;wTien/
&quot;When the Communist Party of Great Britain was first formed there were ahout 35 branches in existence;   to-day there are 54 solid branches besides half a dozen weak groups which on the first favourable opportunity can be   constituted solid branches.     In addition we are in touch with groups in at least a dozen other districts where branches might possibly be formed.&quot;...Our first step w?.s to compile a complete register of the membership with details of their Trade Tfnion organisation.    There are yet several culprit branches who have not yet supplied the information, and the collection of that which we have was only achieved after persistent circularisation.    Our intentions are to group the members according to their industry, to convene meetings of the groups so that they may discuss all matters peculiar to their industry and to their particular Trade Unions.    A group of members inside the Amalgamated Engineering Union has already been formed and is in active operation.    Others will be formed just ^s soon as minor difficulties of tlie present moment are overcome.&quot;A conference w-:s held of all our members who hold official positions inside the Trade Unions and resolutions were passed, since forwarded to the branches, giving a lead for our activities.    It needs to be pointed out th?;t in this group organisation the first essential understanding is that the activities of all members in all spheres must be guided by the interests of the Party.&quot;A complete record has been obtained of the Parliamentary and local electoral positions in every district, also of the relations of the branches with the local Labour Parties.    This record was only obtained after repeated circularisation and has been very useful to the Executive Committee in its deliberations.;lSsver.-il conferences have been held of members of the Party who hold positions on public bodies.    At these, as with the Industrial groups, it was confirmed that the duty of these members is first to own allegiance to the Communist Psrty.    It was further resolved that in order to ensure this, branches should form Committees to meet, consult with, and instruct their public representatives...;&apos;A register h, s been compiled of members of the v*rty who are uos^Soyad .,nd conferences have been held of these members in order that they might discuss their activities inside the ranis of the unemployed. Wist it is true that, at the time of writing this reoort   the unemployed movement is very stagnant, nevertheless the&quot;movement has great possibilities and&quot;Public Bodies&apos;: Pnem;ploymentour/
our possibilities end our members, by exchange of opinion and discussion are learning how best to direct their activities.&quot;Agricultural&quot;Covering as it does a large Home Counties area, . the committee has had to give consideration to the possibility of conducting propaganda amongst the Agricultural workers.    This is obviously a difficult problem, but already the response received from our various suggestions bes been very good.    Wo have in hand two leaflets pealing with this particular problem. . when they are. ready they will&apos; be placed in the bands of those most favourably suited for distributing them.   We are also working out a. scheme for meetings in rural areas..   ^Co-operative Movement , - .&apos;! Just..recently we have given -consideration to the possibilities of Communist aotivity inside the Co-operative Movement.    We feel that there is a.very wide field for us, and one that has been too much neglected,    The machinery of the Party in this connection has not yet been fully developed but we hope before long, to so organise our efforts that we shall become a real influence amongst the co-operators.&quot;Propaganda&quot;$ever in the history of any other movement haa there been bo much propaganda undertaken as, is now undertaken by the Communist Party.    la the London area no less than. 150 meetings a week are. run...:. :. . &quot;leaflets r.&quot;In addition to the Agricultural leaflets mentiontd above the Committee has Hist printed a monthly leaflet the london Organiser&apos;,    Unfortunately the sales ftf the first issue were very small and as we sell it at the bare cost price based upon a reasonable circulation, we suffered a fihanolai loss. However, we have better hopes for the future.&quot;The Manchester branches of the party decided on Ifay 27ththat no new iaeabers should be admitted during the next three months as they had reason to believe the police wereattempting to obtain membership. &apos;  In view,of recent eventsit was resolved that names and addresses should not be disclosed, but instead of using names they would substitutenumbers, and these would be used in the minute :books *as wellas other hooks and&apos; documents.    The books are to,be takencare of by a member who is not suspected- or.likely to be,     - -searched/
searohed &quot;by the police, and scrap paper will be used at meetings, the particulars to be entered up in the books afterwards,    $he chairman told the meeting that every man was expected to be prepared to go to prison if necessary.    In the event of Inkpin being convicted and the Association being declared Illegal, Instead of :   communicating one branch with another in the ordinary way they intended that each branch should form groups of six members, and one from each of these groups to the number of six would meet at a given rendezvous, and in this way they would obtain information of the movement throughout the country,   Ihese bodies will be. termed Central Committees,Ten members were expelled for non-attendanoe and a levy of 2/- was put on employed members and l/- on unemployed.    It was stated at this meeting that organisers will in future be paid  8 weekly and expenses,- * Sylvia&apos; P;nkhurst wbb released from Holloway on May 30th: about IOC people welcomed her outside the prison and she then, attended a breakfast at the Bustace Miles restaurant, .       \. .&apos; &apos;&quot;\&apos;&apos;TES TOD. TB&amp;P3 UNION MERHATIOKAI. /     .;./,  -Having   failed in their attempt to bring about an unofficial strike of railwaymen and transport workers the Red Trade Union International Organisers are now concentrating on the September meeting of the Traces Union Congress and on the engineers,  1 special manifesto to the engineers has been prepared by the Workers&apos; Committee Movement:   this will appear in the next issue of &quot;The Worker&quot; and it is hoped that the same type oan be used to print it in the form of leaflets:   by this method it is thought that the cost will be considerably reduced,. George BJRrvey, the North Eastern organiser, is disappointed with the result of his work and admits thathe/
he has gained little or no support from prominent local trade unionists.    He has arranged a series of meetings which are to he addressed .by Toin Mann and has challenged the Mco of Northumberland to a &quot;debate with Mann&quot;.    The latter is, however, shortly leaving this country to attend the Moscow Congress of the    Red Trade ,Union International on July 1st,During Tom Dingleyl$ imprisonment, H.M. limery will take over his work in the Midlands.    hr&amp;inH tfork is to be done by Cardinal of Birmingham.Eoulis is still abnormally active in Scotland and is probably the most successful organiser, since it is largely due to  his efforts that the Scottish Trade Union Congress and the Fife, Kinross and Clackmannan Miners8 Association have affiliated to the Rod /Brade Union International.    On Iky ^oth,about 45 trade union delegates attended a meeting in the Uaity KA1, Diindee: 36 voted in favour of the first resolution of the British Bureau and 29 voted for a resolution that &quot;we try to get bur union branches to recognise the Red Trade Union Conference by sending delegates even although our S^eoutives refuse to do so.&quot;    The proceedings were somewhat acrimonious.The following are extracts taken from a letter written to headquarters on Mky 11th by N. Watkins, the representative of the British Bureau, who is at present in Moscow:-  &apos;&quot;The Congress of the above International is fast approaching and tne necessary preparations are being &apos; made for the accommodation of foreign delegates, also, every effort is being made to collect material and information bearing upon representation from the Trades Unions and unofficial groups in the different countries.... A&quot;It is absolutely necessary that a regular system of correspondence should: be immediately instituted between the Bureau in England&apos; and %W British Section at Headquarters.    $be Seotion should be fully informed regarding the work of the Buraau and its recent developments, the extent of the influenoe of thelabour/.
labour movement and its effects on the Trade union movement, from without and within.4 &apos; &apos;      &apos; *&apos;&quot;Enquiries are being made by the Bureau, or rather by the Provisional Council regarding the number of delegates which are likely to attend the Congress in July,    Personally, I hove not received $ any information from&apos;you, officially, on this subject,    Therefore, I have been unable to supply the Council with the figures asked for.   I have simply stated at random what I have succeeded in gleaning from the daily papers.   The present industrial upheaval will very probably aot unfavourably :towards a strong British representation, knowing that the attention of the masses is concentrated on tne issue before them, the question being of such vital importance and assuming such gigsatic proportions, it is possible that the question of sending of delegates to Moscow may not receive as muoh attention as it would otherwise have received.   &apos; Nevertl&amp;ess, all eyes are fixed upon the miners fight, and the sterling qualities of the miners are again demonstrated in the splendid fight for freedom. Nevertheless certain groups (unofficial groups) have probably decided&quot;to send a d elegate, &quot;and some of the miners1 organisations, for example, the Fife Miners&apos; organisation and the decision of the Scotch Trade union Congress to affiliate to the British Bureau must really mean that they also are sending delegates...&quot;A large number of imerlean delegates have already arrived in Moscow.    Not having received any intimation about the postponement of the Congress, they arrived in time for the Iky Congress.&quot;The Council are at present considering the advisability of calling an International Miners1 Conference to be held in Moscow on September 1st. If tois meets with the. approval of the Council, I will immediately notify you of the same so that the preparatory work may proceed with all speed in England.&quot;Comrade Bill Haywood from America, and Comrade Crtiom, President of the 111^-Russian Miners&apos; Union, Comrade Jansen from Holland and myself are all fully convinced that the psychological moment has arrived. The conditions are mellow and ripe and should be taken advantage of to call an Intamational Miners1 Conference to supplement the opposition of the past.&quot;With a successful Marine and Transport Conference at Potrograd in. August and a Miners&apos; Conference to follow, these should prove a really good asset to the Rod International and assist in cementing together the workers of the various Industries.&quot;&quot;THE SCOTTISH l&amp;BOUR OOLLECrffOil May 28 th the Scottish - ikbour.

In Glasgow and distriot there were 30 evening classes with an attendance of 300 students.Three &quot;bursars&quot; from the Lanarkshire Miners&apos; County Union attend the day classes and three from the Fife, Kinross and Clackmannan Miners1 Association.    One from the Amalgamated Society of Toolmakers attended for five months.. The A-otflgamated Engineering Union, in which the Toolmakers Society is now merged, could not be induced to set aside a sum of money for the purpose of enabling this &quot;bursar&quot; to complete the course.Hinshelwood of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, who took the chair at the conference, stated that their hands were tied for lack of money but the last Trade Union Congress carried a motion that the question of taking the College over be considered, and if that were done the College would be made representative of the trade union movement.   He added that books of Id. stamps (or stamps to cost a penny) were being printed to be sold to obtain money on behalf of the College,Mainwaring complimented the Scottish Labour College on the splendid turnout of delegates, of whom there were 500 present.   He urged that the College must be saved in order to counteract the activities of the &quot;Workers1 Educational Association&quot; and Raskin College,J.p, Macdougall said he was not in favour of the stamp scheme for raising money.   They should go to the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society and force them to hand over  500 as a first instalment.   He criticised the miners for their poor response (financially) on behalf of the College.   A Lanarkshire miners&apos; delegate retorted that theminers/
miners always assisted most generously all working class institutions, ana, in fact, wore the real fighters for the working classes. ARRESTS   AMD   OCWVIQTIOHaOn, Iky 24th J.G. Hall, a stoker of the Royal Fleet Reserve was sentenced by a naval court martial at Portsmouth to 3 years1 penal servitude for endeavouring to incite men to commit an act of mutiny and for behaving with oontempt to his superior officer on April 30th and !fc.y 1st.On May ,35th the trial was concluded et Cupar Sheriff Court,of 3om Bird, and twenty-three other men on charges of mobbing, rioting, looting, assault and theft committed at Thornton Junction and Markinch on the night of April 12th - 13th, Bird ,wa3 sentenced to 3 months1, 18 to 1 month&quot;s imprisonment and the charges against the remaining five were found not proven.On May 26th Tom Dingley, who is one of the paid organisers of the Shoj stewards  Movement, was sentenced at Nuneaton to 2 months1 &quot;oard labour for a speech likely to cause disaffection among the civilian population,,On May 2*7th, James Bath, alias &quot;Jim the Baker&quot;, was bound over at Birmingham in his own recognisances in a sum of  20 to keep the peace in consequence of a speech made in the Bull Ring on May 19th.On M^y 30th, George Teet,:the corresponding secretary of the   Roc- Trade Union Internationaly was: sentenced to 1 month1 s imprisonment and fined  100 for in default two months&quot; further imprisonment) and Tim Kime, the secretary of the National Workers&apos; Committee  Movement was sentenced to 1 month1s imprisonment for aiding and abetting the printing and /
-t. and circulation of the leaflets &quot;A Call to Action&quot;, and &quot;Clear for Action&quot;.    The National Labour Press was fined  50 in the seme connection.On May 30th, Thomas Kilgariff, John Ryder and Ernest* * *Brough,. all communists, were charged &quot;before the Manchester ,   Stipendiary in connection with a demonstration organised by the Openshaw unemployed on the occasion of the visit of the Crown Prince of Japan to Armstrong Whitworth1s on . May 25th.. Ryder was acquitted and Xilgariff and Brpugh wer bound ovor in  5 each to keep the peace for 6 months.On May 30th Sarah Connor, wife of an Artillery non-commissioned officer was&quot; charged at Aldershot with committing an act calculated to cause disaffection among His Majesty1 e forces.   She was remanded ,On June 1st at Plymouth ferry Pollitt, London organiser of the Red Trade Union International was fined  5 (or sentenced to 23 days1 imprisonment) on each of two charges regarding speeches likely to cause disaffection; the fines were paid.THE &quot;DAILY -HERaLD&quot;   .    &apos;The &quot;Daily Herald,T Is in trouble with its &quot;May Day . Annual&quot;.;   after having. had a large number printed and having made contracts with advertisers, it has been found that Lab din? will hot buy itr   The advertisers are refusing to pay unless a certain number is so,ld.    Extremists are therefore visiting branches of the National Uaion of Railwayman:,  one man has visited twenty branches and statesj that he has only had one refusal, as the members can spend the &quot;Management funds&quot; if disinclined to buy with their own money a &quot;lay Day Annual&quot; which, is a month old.SINNffBIN IN&apos; 0HE..T BRITAIN &apos;  &apos; &quot;On May 28th William Dunne alias Lane, known as &quot;The Digger&quot; end John Punch were charged at Liverpoolwith/
with having solicited Sergeant,Batty of the Kings1 Liverpool Regiment to sell 34 rifles and 10,000 rounds of ammunition.   Dunne first approached Batty and several meetings took plaoo &quot;between the three men at one of which a man known as &quot;The Strangor&quot; took part.    Batty was offered&apos; 140 for the rifles and ammunition if in good condition after a sample had been approved.   The two men were-remanded but efforts to find &quot;The Stranger&quot; have, so far, been unsuccessful.On May 26th filre men were brought before the Manchester Police Court on charges under the Firearms Act and remanded until-June 3rd.   The arrests were the sequel of the police raid on an outbuilding in Whalley Range on May 25th, when the police discovered 618 detonators,&quot;1,719 rounds of live ammunition, 2,583 high explosive charges, 25 rifles, 4 pistols and 8 bayonets.   The prisoners refused to make any statement but McGallogly said &quot;My orders are not to say anything&quot;.   The men are believed to be Sinn Feiners.The summer meetings of the Irish Self-Determination league in the Newcastle area have been fairly well attended: the principal speakers are R. Purcell, C Barrington and Councillor T. O^onnor.    One of the principal objects -of the meetings is to raise money for the relief of distress in Ireland.There has been less Sinn Fein activity in Glasgow during the week:   meetings held have been more or less constitutional.    On May 27th the &quot;West of Scotland Peace with Ireland Union&quot; held a meeting -in St. AndrewTs Hall which was attended by a middle class audience.   The Marchioness of Aberdeen was one of the speakers.The officials of the Lanarkshire Miners1 Union have brought a sisnctor action against the Glasgow &quot;Dally Record&quot;for/
m  14   -for an article in which it was alleged that the Union had given a donation of  100 to Sinn 2?ein.   The officials claimdamages of  100 each,The recent outrages in England have resulted in a strong public feeling against Sinn Pein.The action of the Crown Forces in the attack made upon the Dublin Customs House on Hay 25th was very gallant. Eight Sinn Seiners, including three leaders, were killed; nine were wounded and 127 arrests were made.   Among, the arrested were many men who are-wanted &quot;by the police.   Six members of the Grown forces were wounded and one has died since,During the week attacks have been made by the rebels on Police Barracks in Tipperary, Kerry and King1s County, and on the Naval Wireless Station in Kingstown.   On May 27t Sinn Seiners raided the offices of the Yost Typewriting Company and carried off ten machines, probably to replace , those seized by the Crown Forces.John Moylan, Commandant of Ho.2 Cork Brigade, together with 12 men and a Hotchkiss gun have been captured Important papers have been seized belonging to Ernest 0*Mal a staff officer of the Irish Republican Headquarters, and. from these it appears that the Irish Republican Army is organised on a divisional and brigade basis,  War material reaches Ireland from Manchester in considerable quantities and Jev/s are said to be active in sending these consignments.   Messages continue to be carried in Ireland by very young members of the Fianna, who are exempt from search owing to their youth.The situation remains grave and other outrages are likely to take place.
