The object of the Bill is to arm the Government with a convenient weapon against incitement to revolutionary violence.   It was argued that on the expiration of D.0BR.A* seme such measure would be found necessary,. The Committee have considered and revised the Clauses of the Bill with some care at three successive Meetings, and are of opinion that if a Measure of this kind is desired, the Bill iig its present shape is appropriate for the purpose for which it is intended.   It was the unanimous opinion of the members of the Committee that, pending the duration of the present Coal Strike, it would be inexpedient to introduce the Bill, and some members of the Committee were doubtful of the wisdom of - placing such a Measure upon the Statute Book at all, preferring to trust to the common sense of the people to treat with contempt the inflammatory speeches and writings against which the Bill is aimed.   Others were of opinion that the Bill was required.   The Cabinet is asked to decide the broad question of policy.fSgdu ) H.A,I*. FISHER,2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.I. 1st June, 1921,
