Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1921.4SECRET.CABINET.THE SITUATION IN PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN view of some remarks made by the Minister of Health at the recent Cabinet meeting on Middle Eastern Affairs, I think it necessary to circulate to my colleagues the enclosed account of recent events in Palestine and of the situation there. It has reached me through General Congreve.   T do not entirely accept all its statements.There is no doubt we are in a situation of increasing danger which may at any time involve us in serious military embarrassments with consequent heavy expenditure. Besides this, we shall no doubt be exposed to the bitter resentment of the Zionists for not doing more to help their cause and for not protecting them better. With the resources at my disposal I am doing all in my power, but I do not think things are going to get better in this part of the world, but rather worse.W. S. C.June 9, 1921.O.S.I., General Headquarters.1. I arrived in Jaffa on the 8th May, 1921, and have enquired into the events leading up to the outbreak on the 1st May, 1921, and what happened during the disturbances. The following report is based upon information obtained from the military and civil authorities, the French, Italian and Spanish Consuls, Moslem, Christian and Jewish notables, and others. I have not attempted to give a detailed account of the troubles, nor of the military operations, and confined myself to general account of events with special stress on matters which more particularly interest General Staff Intelligence.2. In order to understand the causes and significance of the outbreak on the 1st May, it is necessary to know what the political situation was in Palestine at the time. The following sketch of that situation is given from my long and intimate connection with Palestine since 1917. Ever since our occupation of the country the inhabitants have disliked the policy of founding a national home for the Jews in Palestine. This feeling has gradually developed into nothing short of bitter and widespread hostility, and the Arab population has come to regard the Zionists with hatred and the British with resentment. Mr. Churchill&apos;s visit put the final touch to the picture. He upheld the Zionist cause and treated the Arab demands like those of a negligible opposition to be put off by a few political phrases and treated like bad children. After this the Arabs decided to send a delegation to Europe, and funds have been collected all over Palestine and subscribed with extraordinary enthusiasm by all classes. 1 personally know of several cases showing how even the poor subscribed with the hope of the delegation being able to change the present British policy.3. The causes of the Moslem and Christian opposition to and hatred of the British Zionist policy may be shortly summed up under some of the main headings : (1.) The special privileges accorded to Jews.(2.) The influence of the -Zionist Commission and the openly declared politicalaims of the Zionist. (3.) The use of Hebrew as an official language. (4.) The immigration of great numbers of low-class Jews. (5.) The behaviour and immorality of the immigrants.(6.) The fall in price of land, trade depression, and the prohibition of export ofcereals affecting the peasantry., (7.) Arrogance of Jews towards Moslems and Christians.[6348]
(8.) No representation in the Government of the country or control of expenditure being accorded to the Arabs, who realise that the money taken from them in taxes is spent on employing foreign Jewish labour instead of native, keeping up Jewish immigration offices and such-like matters.(9.) Loss of confidence in the Palestine Administration and in the British Government.(10.) The realisation of the injustice of self-government being given to nomadicsavages in Trans-Jordania and refused to Palestine. (11.) Moslem and Christian religious feeling aroused by conduct and aims of theJews.(12.) The Government attitude towards Moslem and Christian petitions, protests and complaints which are frequently not answered or disregarded while Jews appear to have at all times the ear of the administration. &apos; (13.) The use of the Zionist flag.For some months Bolshevism has been growing in Palestine among the Russian, Polish and other Jewish immigrants.A small band of some thirty Communists have been working steadily, and undoubtedly gained a considerable number of adherents and sympathisers. Owing to the dislike of the Arabs for the foreign Jews and the latter&apos;s poor knowledge of the language and psychology of the natives, as well as the dislike on the part of Moslems for Communists&apos; doctrines, the Bolsheviks have made few converts among the Arabs. It might be noted, nevertheless, that during the disturbances a crowd of armed Moslem villagers were seen marching under a red flag. The activities of the Jewish Communists in Jaffa were reported by the Governor, the police and myself (see special report on the subject). The Palestine Administration, however, did not take the matter seriously, and the Zionists have always pretended that the movement was of no importance.On the evening of the 30th April pamphlets in Hebrew, Yiddish and Arabic (copies attached herewith) were distributed by Jewish young men, boys and young women. The Arabic pamphlet was widely circulated to the Moslem population, and contains an appeal for a May-Day cessation of work and declaims against the British calling for the proletariat to rise against them. As the Arab pamphlet is written in good literary Arabic its origin has given rise to various surmises that it was written at Baku or Angora or in Egypt.It seems particularly certain that the Russian Soviet Government has had agents directly working in this country for some time. To sum up, the Arab population of Palestine has become irritated to such an extent that an outbreak has seemed to close observers inevitable sooner or later.4. On the morning of the 1st May a moderate Socialist May-Day demonstration was permitted by the authorities to take place at Tel-Aviv, the Jewish quarter of Jaffa. An unauthorised demonstration by some fifty Communists carrying a red flag, after trying to force some Jewish workmen to down tools, came into conflict with the moderates, and were eventually forced out of Tel-Aviv into the mixed Moslem and Jewish quarter of the Menshieh to the west. There the police attempted to disperse the Bolsheviks and a conflict ensued. The Moslem inhabitants rushed to help the police against the Jews and a general disturbance occurred, which spread within about an hour to the south end of the town. Moslems and Christians.rushed to join their comrades, and the wildest rumours of Jewish attacks on Arabs helped to excite the rage of the Arabs. The state of the dead and wounded has proved that the Arabs were mainly armed with sticks, while the Jews had revolvers. Some bombs were thrown by both sides. To the south, the house for the reception of Jewish immigrants was attacked and a number of-Jews killed. It is stated that the Jews first began firing on the Arab passers by and that a- Christian named Metoulli threw a dynamite capsule (used for fishing) into the house, and was himself killed by a second, which&apos;fell back on him. This Christian&apos;s funeral was the occasion of a great demonstration by Moslems and Christians, a Moslem carrying the cross in front of the cofFm. The cortege forced the doors of the French consulate, and the consul was obliged to appear and salute the dead without, however, saying a word. Several incidents which occurred on the first day&apos;s rioting caused the Arabs to suspect the impartiality of the troops and the authorities. A few of these incidents may be quickly summarised : (1.) The, placing of Jewish guides on the armoured cars.   (This was afterwards altered.)
(2.) Jewish civilians getting soldiers to break open Moslem houses in a supposedhunt for arms.   (This was stopped.) (3.) A Jewish civilian being seen and heard ordering British soldiers to fire onthe crowd.(4.) The issue by order of the civil secretary of eighteen rifles from the port authority to demobilise Jewish soldiers who paraded in uniform and were marched with fixed bayonets through the streets to the Jewish quarter by a Jewish ex-officer, Colonel Margolin.(5.) The searching of Arabs by Jews in front of British soldiers.The feeling that the authorities were unduly helping the Jews culminated in a monster demonstration on the 2nd May, when Moslems and Christians forced the French, Italian and. Spanish Consuls to accompany them to the Governor and put forward as intermediaries their demand that British troops should be replaced by Indians and that the Arabs should he given arms to defend themselves against the armed Jews. An attempt had been made to pull down the flag of the French Consulate in order to take it with the demonstration, but this the French Consul prevented with great difficulty. Cries of &quot;Long live France, Italy and Spain ! &quot; and &quot; Down with the Jews and England ! &quot; were heard.OiTthe 3rd May some isolated cases of killing on both sides occurred.On the 4th May trouble nearly broke out afresh because of a false rumour of Jews killing Moslem women and children.Pillaging by low-class Arabs and thieves took place on the 1st and 2nd May and numbers of women took part. Considerable damage was done to Jewish shops. Women also played a considerable part in urging on the Arabs to attack Jews.During the disturbances the action of the&apos;Governor ol Jaffa in mixing with the crowds and accompanied by various notables trying to calm them had a very good effect.The restraint and tact shown by the military also did a great deal to quieten the excited mobs and prevented further bloodshed.On the 5th May some 3,000 Arabs (according to reports) had assembled to the north of the Jewish colony of Petah Tikvah (Mulebbis) about 10 miles north of Jaffa. Another force of Arabs several hundred strong was preparing to attack from the south.The Indian cavalry and armoured cars and aeroplanes which were sent to the scene arrived in time to prevent these-attacks succeeding, and the southern attackers were repulsed and pursued with the loss of some forty killed and many wounded. The northern attackers were repulsed with a loss of some twenty killed. This party was made up of peasants from many villages to the north and east who had assembled to attack the Jews on hearing that Arabs were being killed by Jews in Jaffa.The casualties at Jaffa, as far as I can ascertain at present, have been 40 Jews and 18 Moslems and Christians killed, and 180 Jews and 50 Moslems and Christians wounded.Some cases of atrocities have been alleged by both sides, such as two Moslem women said to be killed by Jews and a Jew being mutilated by Arabs. Arab wounded brought into Mulebbis after the cavalry repulsed the attack from the south were afterwards found to have been injured by burns caused by acid or vitriol thrown on them, they stated by Jews. 1 myself examined two of these cases with a doctor, who certified that the wounds were caused by some acidIn the attack on Mulebbis from the north some 200 head of cattle were driven off by the Arabs.5. The present situation deserves close attention.Bitter feeling exists on both sides, and at the moment of writing both parties are boycotting each other, and no buying or selling is taking place between them.The Jews are divided between feelings&apos;of fear, hatred and desire for revenge, and are asking for severe measures against all and sundry. They accuse the Government of negligence and lack of strength, and the military of lack of severity in dealing with the Arabs. How far the latter accusation is false may be gauged by the casualties inflicted on the Arabs Avho attacked Mulebbis.The Zionists above all would like to prove that the attack was not the outcome of the bitter antagonism which by their own methods they have excited in the hearts of the Arabs&apos;.&apos;The Zionists, therefore, are trying to substantiate a theory to the effect that the outbreak on the 1st May was premeditated by the Arabs, and that it was arranged by a few notables, encouraged by French intrigue.   Nothing could be further from
the truth. I have carefully gone into the case, and there is not a vestige of proof of French or other intrigue. On the contrary, the attitude of the French consul appears to have been all that could have been desired. There is no evidence of premeditation on the part of the Arabs, but everything points to a deliberate attempt on the part of Bolshevik Jews to cause trouble. In the state of extreme irritation of the whole Moslem and Christian population against the Zionists any kind of disturbance was sufficient to let loose the storm.6. It is impossible not to admit the truth of the conclusion that if the present British policy in Palestine is to continue unmodified a much larger garrison than the present one will be required to enforce it,The Arab population is so incensed against the Zionists and the British because of their support of the former that we must inevitably give concessions to them. These concessions should be prohibition- of Jewish immigration until it can be properly controlled and the present intensive system be definitely abolished, and representative Government for all the people in Palestine.We are not faced by a simple outbreak of mob violence, in spite of pillage and other signs of participation of criminals and evil elements of the population. The troubles in Jaffa and other parts of the country are only the -expressions of a deep-seated and widely spread popular resentment at the present British policy.^^Ff&quot;that policy is not modified the outbreaks of to-day may become a revolution to-morrow.(Signed)        C.
