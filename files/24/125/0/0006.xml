Prime Minister,10, Downing Street, S.KT.1.&apos;2EZ LABOUR PARTY, 33, 3ccleston Square *s,wa.May 28th 1921.Dear Prime Minister,I am desired by the Executive Commiitee of the Labour Party to forward for your information the attached resolution which it has adopted at its meeting this week,Yours sincerely,(Sgd.) jos, MIDDLETOI. Assistant Secretary.
The Executive Committee of the Labour Party views with the deepest apprehension the efforts which are being made to suppress freedom of speeoh by the conviction and imprisonment of individuals alleged to have been guilty of seditious utterances and statements prejudicial fro the public interest, as interpreted by the Government and the Bench,     It holds that liberty of speech is the birthright of every citizen and the fundamental condition of democracy. It believes that truth cannot be suppressed by coercion and that false doctrines will fail to convince the people. The Executive Committee, therefore, places its reliance on the judgment of the citizens and regards any attempt at the suppression of free speech as an unwarrantable inter-ference with the liberty of the individual and an insult to the intelligence of the electorate.    It is not concerned with the views of those Who are now under trial or suffering imprisonment for the public expression of their opinions. Its sole concern is with the maintenance of the principle of freedom of speech and discussion, and with the efforts^ which are being made to establish an undisguised police censorship repulsive to the temper and dangerous to the peace of the British people.2, Whitehall Gardens, S..W.1. End. June, 19E1.
