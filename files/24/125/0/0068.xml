J -                M5)aORAHDUM iff TF3 MINIVER OF HEALTH.               H.29,I urn inves gating the application to the Ministry of Health of the recent Cabinet decision as to a reduction on the estimates for 1922-25, and I find it necessary to obtain an immediate Cabinet,decision on housing policy.Of the nett figure of  24,000,000 odd provided on my estimates in 1921-22, about  10,000,000 represents housing charges, about  8,000,000 expenses under the National Health Insurance Acta, about  3,000,000 expenses under State aided health services such as maternity and child welfare, and the balance administration charges and various minor services.In dealing with the Estimates for 1921-2.2 recently in the House of Commons, I referred to the arrangement agreed to between my predecessor and the late Chancellor of the&apos;Exchequer, under which the unlimited liability thrown on the State by the legislation of 1919 was to be limited to the provision of no more than 500,000 houses, under local authorities and public utility societies schemes, the scheme of subsidy to private builders, and the provisions in the legislation of 1919 as to slum areas.     It is necessary now either,to take, in concert with local authorities, the action required to provide houses up to that limit, or to declare a change of policy and I am daily pressed to make an announce-ment on the matter.The figure for nett expenditure on housing included in the rough &apos; total forecast of the&quot;Ministry of Health estimates for 1922-23 submitted some time ago, to the Treasury was  12,500,000 ( 10,000,000 in respect of loss on local authorities and public utility society schemes and  2.500,000 in respect of subsidy to private builders.)     This represents an increase of  2,500,000 on the nett provision made in 1921-22, and that increase would probably in fac&quot;:- have come more nearly to  4,000,000 because, owins to tire delay in legislating for thecontinuance/
continuance of the subsidy to private&quot;builders,- increased provision&apos; under that he-ad would, have to be thrown over into 1922-23. On the other side of the account the recoveries from local authorities for the supply of building materials -nil probably continue in 1922-25 and may amount to  750,000.     If the full provision of 300,000 houses continues to be the policy, then the increase in 1922-23 might well, in prosent building conditions, be much in excess of  4,000,000 and in 1923-24 provision would be required for at least  13,000,000 for local authorities&apos; schemes alone, Instead of the  10,000,000 at present estimated for 1922-23 for those schemes. It follows that unless there is a modification of the agreement betweon my predecessor and the latft Chancellor of the Exchequer there will be a heavy increase on the estinate for housing next year. I take first the position in which we stand as to commitments.Local authorities 1 and, public utility societiesf schemes^Some 176,000 houses are either completed or provided for in signed contracts or in approved tenders which are tantamount to a contract. The annual continuing liability on the State in respect of these 176,000 houses would, I am advised, amount to some  10,000,000 per annum and provision approaching that amount will require to te made on.the 1922-23 estimates.Scheme of subsidy nto private builders *About 31,000 houses have been provisionally certified by local authorities and would rank for subsidy if built and of these about 15,000 are completed and subsidy paid.In relation to - the scheme of subsidy to private builders I have to draw attention to the Housing Bill very recently authorised by the Cabinet and now passing through Parliament, which inter alia extends the period during which building under subsidy can go on up to June 1922, with a further four months at my discretion to meet cases of unavoidable delay or difficulty. Pending the passing of this Bill&apos; applications for subsidy have been suspended but 1 am advised that When it passes there will be a revival of aativity in subsidybuilding/
building. The bill cannot be abandoned because legislation is necessary to meet   pledges given to those persona who owing to the expiry of the previous subsidy legislation at the end of last year could not receive the full payment of subsidy   due to them. Further, apart from Parliamentary difficulties involved in amending the bill, it would in my judgment be disastrous to the credit of the Government to restrict it simply to the fulfilment of these pledges and to abandon completely the policy of building under subsidy.On a careful survey of an extremely difficult situation the following policy occurs to me as a practicable one for the immediate future(1)   To stop local authorities&apos; schemes at the 176,000 houses In signed contracts or approved tenders and to save what 1 can on this commitment by revising contracts, reconsidering standards and so on, using such savings to provide for a few of the hardest cases -of housing needs to such an extent as not to increase the annual charge to the State above  10,000,000,   X do not expect tho saving to be large, since one main condition of saving is success in buying contractors out of contracts very advantageous to them.(2)   In respect of the scheme of subsidy to private builders -(a) to reduce the amount of subsidy by  50 per house for houses started after June 30th,(b) to lay down that houses to qualify for subsidy must, be begun within one month of the granting of the pre 1 irainary c e v tif ica te.(c) to make the grant of certificate more difficult by introducing various restrictive conditions into the regulations.The financial effect of these suggestions on my estimates for1922-23 is extremely difficulty to forecast because I have nomeans of judging of the extent to which building will proceedunder the scheme of subsidy to private builders as above revised,What/
What I should propose is so to administer the subsidy that the charge in 1922-23 does not exceed  2,000,000. 1 take  10,000,000 as the sum likely to be required to meet the State charge on local authorities5 schemes in that year.   If I allow for a credit of  750,000 on sale of materials, I should obtain a nett estimated expenditure of say  11,250,000.I have still to deal with the question of the improvement of slum areas. No material financial liability lias been as yet incurred under these pledges but a great deal of preliminary work has been done and local authorities can reasonably demand a clear statement of policy on this question. I think the least the Government can do is to authorise me to give assistance to selected schemes, on the understanding that the total charge to the Exchequer must not exceed  1,000,000 per annum in any year (equivalent to the present annual State charge on some 16,000 new houses in local authorities * schemes), special steps to be taken to secure that the schemes selected and the methods followed are such as to obtain the best return for the money. So far as the next financial year is concerned I expect that not more than  200,000 would be needed on this account as slum improvement takes time. Allowing for this  200,000, the estimated charge for housing next year would be  11,450,000 or say eleven and a half millions.That sum represents a saving of something between one million and two and a half millions on the provisional estimate for 1922-23 submitted to the Treasury. But it also represents an increase of say one and a half million on the actual provision made in 1921-22.   I expect to be able to provide for most of that increase by economies elsewhere in the estimates but I may say at once that on the above housing policy I,cannot see how my total estimates for next year are to show any material decrease, much less 3uch a decrease as the 20 per cent desired by the Cabinet.
Tho reason for this la clear.    Two years ago the Government pledged itself to a housing policy which   involved an unlimited liability in respect of the housing schemes of local ^authorities and of schemes for slum improvement, and provision for no less than  15,000,000 by way of subsidies to private builders, of which  12,000,000 falls to England and Wales.    The Government 1 s further pledged, in partnership with local authorities, to state-aided health services, such as maternity and child welfare.     It is further pledged to the scheme of National Health Insurance, in partnership with the insured population.    The housing service and the Stato aided health service automatically increase in cost as local authorities&apos; develop their activities&apos;in reliance on the pledges of the Government.My first task la to atop actual increase of expenditure on the Hate-aided health services and,this 1 have in hand,     But I do not see how the Government can now approach Its partners and ask them, because it is short of money, either to pay the whole or a larger proportion of the cost or to scrap the services which it encouraged them to put in hand in reliance on its pledges,Similarly as regards housing my first task ia to stop Increase of expenditure as far as I can and to limit commitments.    My proposal above substitutes(a) Expenditure limited to about  10,000,000 per annum, for an unlimited liability in respect of local authorities1 schemes,(b) a probable total expenditure on the subsidy to private builders of about  8,000,000, for a legislative undertaking to expand  1^,000,000 in England and Wales (the Goschon oroportion of the  15,000,000 authorised by the Act of 1919).(c) Expenditure eventually at the rate of  1,000,000 per annum, for an unlimited liability in respect of slum areas.I wish to make it quite clear that such a programme cannot be defended as having any relation to the housing needs of the country but must be defended simply and solely on the ground of financial Necessity.    There will remain many cases of serious overcrowding and *vil slum conditions in many places.     Improved housing is one of themain/&apos;
main elements in any preventive health service and if the above pro-gramme is adopted on the financial ground it will be in the teeth of strong opposition which win make capital of the fact that the Government are stopping a beneficient scheme just when, owing to continuing fall in prices, the loss on it may be materially reduced and when the Government alone can provide small houses, the return to normal building of such houses by private enterprise not being in sightAccordingly, as Minister of Health, it is not for me to recommend such a policy of reduction as is above described - on the health ground 1 see the strongest objection to it, and, but for the recent decision as to economies in 1922-23, I should have confined myself to the programme of 300,000 houses agreed to between my predecessor and the late Chancellor of the Exchequer and devoted my whole energies to carrying out that programme at the minimum of cost possible, having regard to.the commitments which I find in existence,/1 would observe in conclusion that the Government will not get rid of the housing question by any such measures as these-   I see no prospect of such a return of private enterprise to the construction of working class houses as will help in any material way in the solution of the problem.   f*&apos;he statutory liability for housing provision thrown on local authorities by the legislation of 1919 remains, and they must either be released from it-or a fresh bargain struck with them, one element- in which must be that their share of financial responsibility is Increased to a degree which will ensure their lively interest in economy*   For the moment house construction under my proposals will be proceeding to an extent which will afford a fair ground for postponing a decision on future policy.   But that decision cannot be long postponed.Ministry of Health.
