THIS DOCUaiQKT IS THE PROPER 1Y OP HIS BRITANNIC M^ST^S GOVERNMENT.erst.K&apos;o:0&apos;89. CABINET.Local Government of Greater London. Memorandum by The Minister of Hea1th.L i G * 4 8 **J-JtIn October 1919 the Local Government Committee of the London County Council presented a considered Report to the London County Council in regard to the reform of the local government of London.    They pointed out that the boundaries of the County, which were fixed in 1655, have now become unsuitable for many purposes, and that it was desirable that an Inquiry should be instituted by the Government in order to determine -(1) the particular services which should be   brought under a single administration throughout Greater London:(2) The area of Greater London which should be unified in respect of the administration of thoso services:(3) The authority to which should be entrusted the administration of those services; and(4) The relation of that authority to other local authorities in the area.This Report was adopted by the London County Council, and they asked that the Prime Minister should receive a deputation from the Council on the subject.This deputation was received by the Prime Minister, Lit. Bonar Law and Dr. Add is on on trie 9th December last.At present, for certain purposes, over 100 local authorities have to be consulted, and the Prime Minister felt that a prima facie case had been made out for the appointment of a Royal Commission, but he stated that before coining to a decision it was necessary to consult the other authorities concerned.       He had also agreed to receive adeputation/
deputation from tfra City Corporation before coming to a decision.At ,his request Dr. Add is on received the deputation from the City,   and also addressed letters to the other authorities asking for their views.The City Corporation, deprecated an Inquiry at the present time, as it would involve considerable expenditure of official time and money.     They also urged that the present abnormal conditions would prejudice the result, and that if an Inquiry were instituted, they should be represented on the tribunal.Dr. Addis on in reply stated that it was evident that any form of Inquiry would have to be so designed as to avoid excessive cost, but that he did not agree with, the suggestion that,If there wore to be a Commission, the City should be represented on it.   He felt that what was required was a small body which would command general confidence and which would act as a judicial body*   The deputation replied that the City Corporation would be quite content merely to have ah opportunity of placing their views before such a tribunal.As to the other authorities, the Metropolitan Borough Councils support the request for a Royal Commission, but they would wish the Commission not merely to consider local government, but also the question whether some authority acting for London and the Home Counties should not have power of legislation in regard to domestic affairs.   The County Councils around London suggest that, instead of appointing a Royal Commission, the Ministry of Health should convene a conference of representatives of all the Counties and County Boroughs affected, including the City Corporation.
The suggestion of the Metropolitan Borough -Councils that the scope of the Inquiry should be enlarged so as to consider the question of setting up a new legislative body-may, I think, be dismissed.   It would clearly be a mistake to entrust this question to a Commission set up to consider questions of local government,As regards tho suggestion made by the County Councils outside London, and endorsed by some of the sanitary authorities in the outside area, that a conference should be convened, it seems fairly clear that these bodies are somewhat afraid that the outcome of a judicial inquiry might be that they would lose their separate identity.Prima facie, the proposal for a preliminary conference Is attractive, but it is, I think, open to serious objection.   The London County Council deliberately refrained from making any suggestion as to how these matters should be settled, and it seems to mo that if a preliminary conference vsere called such as the Outer Counties suggest, concrete proposals would come up there, and there would be bitter difference of opinion in regard to them.I think that a case has been made out for setting up a Royal Commission; and having regard to our experience in connection with borough extension inquiries, I think it is essential that no attempt should be made to have the various Interests represented.   What Is needed Is a small, strong, impartial tribunal,   I do not know whether Lord Milner would be prepared to take the Chairmanship of a Royal Commission on this subject, but if he would,he/
he would seem-to be exceedingly suitable,I should propose six other members one   with wide experience of local government in some other large town, one lawyer, one ex-official or official and three business men or men of affairs.A Commission such as this would hear all tho parties and all the various views.   They would have before them Information as to the various services which had  to be pea1 formed, and they would be able to consider the matter from the points of view of efficiency and economy and without bias*ALFRED .M0ND 29 s 0 * 21*frUnis t ry of He a 1th *
