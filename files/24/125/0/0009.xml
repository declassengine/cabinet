REPLY   OP   THE   SOUTH   AFRICAN   GOVERNMENT.Prime Minister:s Office, Cape Tpwn,20th April, 1921.Sir, ,I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 8th March, No.21/31/27, conveying the recommendation of the Assembly of the League of Nations that Governments should under-take, for the years 1922-23 and 1923-24,, not to exceed the sum total of expenditure on the military, naval and air services provided for in the Budget for 1921-22,While my Government is In cordial agreement with the aim of the Assembly, in thus making a practical suggestion to carry out Article VIII of the Covenmt, they desire me to notify the. Council of the League, in terms of the second reservation contained in  your letter, of the following &quot;exceptional conditions&quot; which make it at present uncertain to what extent they will be able to adopt the recommendations in the immediate futures(1)     The Union has never possessed a standing naval, military or air force.   It has not yet had time to develop its citizen forcei the organisation devised for that purpose by the Union Parliament in 1912 hsvir-s, lever been brought into effective being owing to the interrupter?. .c&amp;used&apos; by the Great War and a period of total inactivity since the cessation cf that ware(2)    Before the Great War:-(a) The Xmperia- Government maintained considerable forces stationed in the Union, for defence purposes.(b) There was no Air Force, Imperial or Union, in South Africa.(c) The Imperial and not the Union Government assumed responsibility for naval defence of South African! ports, waters and trade sea-routes.(3)    The circumstances of the present day are that the Imperial Government hag withdrawn practically the whole of the Regular Garrison stationed in the Union before the War. and it Is likely that the Union will have to assume the military obligations whioh before the Great War were assumed by the Imperial Government for purposes of local defence.   The union share in the Naval Defence of South Africa has also still to be determined in consultation with the Imperial Government.  These matters will be discussed at a Conference which it is proposed to hold in London at an early date and any declarations as to the expenditure of the Union on military, naval and air defence in the immediate future would therefore be premature at present.Finally, I desire to emphasize, for the consideration of the Gouncil, &quot;the geographical situation and circumstances&quot; generally of the Union.
(1)    The territory of the Union covers 475,000 square miles and contains a native population in the process of emerging from barbarism, which outnumbers the European population by 4 to 1,(2)    There are, however, in South Africa territories surrounding the Union but within the union economic and political sphere,whereinthe native population outnumbers the European population in far greater proportion.   Seeing that the Union is far and away the strongest civilised State in Central and Southern Africa, the peaceful and orderly development of other states and territories and the welfare and good government of the indigenous native races of Africa and the African Continent in the Southern hemisphere, ore matter ef vital concern to the Union.(3)     Only recently has the Union acquired international status, with its concomitant obligations in the way of national defence, and while other States have for years past made adequate provision for this purpose, the Union has had as yet no opportunities -ty to lay down a basis for future guidance.Besides, by accepting the Mandate for South-West African Territory, sfoa has not only largely Increased her seaboard but has rendered herself liable for the peace, order and defence of a large territory, containing large numbers of natives, hardly developed from the stage of barbarism.Owing to the exceptional conditions mentioned In the first pert of this memorandum, and the geographical situation and circumstances enumerated herein, the Union Government, while they are in general agreement wit X the policy of the League of Nations, do not feel at present justified In giving the definite assurances which the recommendation vf the Assembly suggests.It is needless to add that the military and naval organisation contemplated for the Union has reference entirely to the defence of South Africa and the maintenance of Internal order and peace, and would be useless from the point of view of foreign aggression or operations to be conducted outside of South Africa. It is therefore in complete conformity with the peaceful Ideals which the League has at heart.I have the honour to be, etc.(sgd^   SPOTS.PRIME MINISTER.The Secretary-General, &quot;League of Nations, Geneva.
REPLY OF THE FRENCH hovektlttaro. $3Translation.&quot;FRENCH REPUBLICMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS Paris, 20th April, 1921.League of Nations Section.3, rue Francois Premier.No.91,Sir,In forwarding to me on March 8th last the recommendation adopted on December 14th, 1920, by a majority of the Assembly of the League of Nations with reference to the limitation on the part of each State Member of the League of the military, naval and air expenditure during the two financial years following the next budgetary period, you asked me, on behalf of the Council, what steps the French Government proposed to take with a view to giving effect to this recommendation.After thorough consideration of the question the Government cf the Republic is of opinion that the military, naval or air budgets of the different States do not afford a basis for a fair apprecia-tion of the respective importance of their armaments for the following reasons:1)    These budgets are drawn up in a different way by each state,2)    Without increasing its effectives or its war material a State may have reason to introduce such modifications, or to effect such repairs with regard to this material as would involve additional expenditure of an unforeseen nature^3)    The price of manufacture or upkeep (raw materials, labour etc) is variable and might cause considerable increases in the budgets from year to year which would not, however, signify an increase in armaments.4)    The military, naval or air power of a State no longer depends to-day exclusively upon Its war material In the strict sense of the word, but upon its Industrial capacity and its ability to utilise, with or without previous transformation, the greater part of its peace material for military purposes, This essential factor in the armament capacity of a State carmotfc be ascertained from an examination of its military, naval or air budgets o
5)     Finally, exceptional situations, the causes of which may be of various k&quot;kinds - economic, social, military, etc. -are liable to arise.   The recommendation of the Assembly foresees such situations, blit only in order to submit them to the consideration of the Council of the Lea-rue.   In cir-cumstances of this kind which may assume a character of extreme gravity and urgency^ it would be too much to ask a State to abandon its right of forming a judgment thereon and of taking a decision.I therefore have the honour to inform you that the Government of the Republio considers itself unable to give effect to a recommendation which it regards as based on doubtful premises.? which In Its opinion does not correspond with the object to be attained, and which for these reasons was not voted for by.the French representatives at Geneva.The Government of the Republic desires to point out that this reply should in no way be interpreted as signifying an intention to elude the obligations laid down in the Covenant -obligations the fulfilment of which it has made subject to a previous realisation of certain conditions of which the Assembly itself recognised the necessity..The Government of the Republic on the contrary desires to point out that, faithful to the principles laid dorm in the third resolution voted at Geneva, it has entered resolutely upon the path of reduction of armaments, as is proved by the draft Bill which it has brought in to reduce the term of military servioe, in spite of the very heavy military charges Imposed upon it by its international obligations and considera-tions of national safety.I have the honour to bo etc.(Sgd)   JEAN GOUTMinister Plenipotentiary, Head of the French League of Nations Section.
REPLY   OP   THE   BELGIAN   GOVERNMENT.Translation, MINISTHY OP OTEIGN AFFAIRSDirection.   P.B.S.N., &amp; B.I.B. BRUSSELS, April 21st.1921,Sir,With reference to your letter of 21.31.27 of March 8th last, I have the honour to inform you that the Belgian Government will conform to the recommendation adopted by the Geneva Assembly to the effect that the Governments should undertake not to exceed, in the two financial years following the next budget, the total sum of military, naval and air expenditure allowed for in that budget with the reservation of1)    Any forces, war material or money supplied at the instance of the League of Nations for the execution of the engagements undertaken in virtue of Article 16 of the Covenant or of the Treaties registered by the/League02)     Any exceptional circumstances of which the Council of the League of Nations is informed, in accordance with the spirit of paragraphs 2 and 6 of Article 8of the Covenant.I have the honour to be, etc. (Sgd)   HENRI J AS PAR,Sir Eric Drummond,Secretary General of the League of Nations, GENEVA,
Sir,In reply to your letter to the Finnish Minister for Foreign Mfairs. dated March 8th, last, requesting the Finnish Government to consider, in accordance with the Geneva Resolution of December 14th, 1920^ whether it could undertake not to exceed, during the two financial years following the next budgetary period, the total figure of military, naval and air expenditure provided for that period, my Government, without formulating any opinion as to the value of the principle underlying the above-mentioned Resolution, has&apos;Instructed mgHo communicate to you the follow5n  Tacts.v- &apos;    ,The credit net apart for military &quot;eposes amounted in 1919 to 22% of t$6 total State expenditure, in 1920 to 10$, and in 1921 to 15$.    While it is true that theto^al expenditure has continually increased, the percentage of the credit set apart for military expenditure shews a continuous decrease.Flnlahdt on account of her exposed geographical situation and the exteiit of her coasts, requires a fleet, which at the present time is almost entirely lackingi    Moreover, the I necessary fortifications on the east frontier have only just begun.    Barracks are insufficient, and the armament and equipment of the troops is defective and out-of-date  It was absolutely necessary to effect a thorough re-organisation which is now being tarried out. Finally, war material, of tjhich Finland does not possess suffioi-ent stocks, must, in the absence of a national industry of this nature,&quot; be obtained from abroad at prices which are all the more variable in that the market for this material is not yet stablej while the inflation of the prices is due to the fact that the depreciation of the Finnish currency coincides with the increased prioe of goods on the world market.In these circumstances, the Finnish Government regrets that it is unable to undertake not to exceed, during the next two fl-nanoial years, the total figure of military, naval and air expenditure provided for the financial year 1921.I have the honour to be, etc.,(Sgd)   Lnckell.Sir Eric DruiTWond,Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Geneva.Legation of Finland, 22 Rue de la Palx,Paris, 26th April 1921.Ho. 367.
Translation................ Paris, April 26th 1921.Imperial Japanese fcmbassy.Sir,In aooordanbe with the decision taken by the Council of the League of Nations at its meeting on February 25tfo, you have been so good as to communicate to me, in a letter dated March 8th, 1921, the recommendation adopted by a majority of the first Assembly with regard to the limitation of military, naval and air expenditure during the two financial years following the next budgetary period of each State Member of the League.    The Japanese Government, which was duly informed through my Embassy of the contents of your letter, has now instructed me to transmit to you&apos;the following statement of Its views.It is the earnest desire of the Japanese Government that an agreement should be reached between all States for the simul-taneous reduction of their armaments, In accordance with the spirit of the League of Nations and with a view to the maintenance of peace throughout the world.    kevertheless, in view of the fact that the Council of the League, by virtue of the provisions of the Covenant, is closely studying plans for disarmament, the Japanese Government does not consider that it would be advisable to take any act on upon the recommendation of the Assembly until these plans have been completed.I have the honour to be, etc., (Sgd)   K.

Reply to the Government of India,India Office, Whitehall, S ,V/.I.;J. k P. 1885.27th April 1921.The Secretary of State for India presents his compliments to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations and has the honour to acknowledge the receipt of. his letter of 8th March 1921 (21/51/27) enclosing the recommendation adopted by a majority vote of the Assembly with regard to the limitation of military, naval and air expenditure during the two financial years following.The Secretary of State is in correspondence with the Government of India as to the recommendation in question and hopes to be able to reply to the Secretary-General*s enquiry without undue delay, but regrets that in the meantime he is not In a position to supply the information requested before the 1st May, 1921.The Secretary-General, The League of Nations, Palais des Nations, Geneva,
Sir,in a letter dated 8th March last, No. 21/31/27, you were good enough to send me a copy of the Recommendation adopted by a majority of the Assembly on 11th Decemberj 1920; with reference io the limitation of military, naval and air expen-diture during the two financial y^ars following the next budgetary period Of each State Member of the League.At the same time you were good enough to inform me that the Council had instructed you to request the Government of the States Members of the League to inform you before the 1st May of the steps which they proposed.;to take with a view to giving effect to this Recommendation.In reply I beg to oommunicate to you the following facts:In Denmark a Conmlasion set up by virtue of the law, No. 55 of 12th February 1921, has been instructed to draw up a plan for the future organisation of the Danish Army and Navy. This Commission, upon which all the principal politioal parties of the Danish Parliament are represented, has already drawn up a scheme of military re-organisation.As no party has submitted a scheme involving an increase in military expenditure, and as the Government itself has no intention of submitting a scheme involving such an increase, it is improbable that during the two financial years following the next budgetary period there will be an increase in the military, naval and air expenditure of Denmark.I beg you to be good enough to Inform me if possible of the points of view of the other Members of the League with regard to this question.   *I have the honour to be, etc,(Sgd)   HARALD SCAVENIUS.Sir Eric Drummond,Secretary-General of the League of Nations, GENEVA.DANISH MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.
