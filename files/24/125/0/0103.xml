[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1921.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 3099.CABINET.GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND ACT.Memorandum by the Chief Secretaey for Ireland.I CIRCULATE to the Cabinet a note by Sir Francis Greer, the Parliamentary Draftsman to the Irish Government, calling attention to the effect of section 6 of the Government of Ireland Act on Acts passed in the United Kingdom Parliament after the 3rd May last.If the effect of this provision is overlooked in Bills affecting Ireland a position of considerable difficulty may be created thereby for the Parliaments of Southern and Northern Ireland. I hope, therefore, that my colleagues will give instructions, so far as their Departments are concerned, that a copy of any draft Bill affecting Ireland should be furnished to the Irish Office before it is introduced into Parliament.H irish Office, S.W. 1, . &apos;July 1, 1921.Memorandum by Sir Francis Greer.Chief Secretary,It would be well to bring it to the notice of the Departments in London that any Act passed in the United Kingdom Parliament after the 3rd May last will, under section 6 of the Government of Ireland Act, be unalterable by either of the Irish Parliaments even although it relates solely to matters within their respective jurisdictions.If it is desired to avoid this consequence, the Bill must contain a provision to the effect that the Act is, for the purposes of the said section, to be deemed to be an Act passed before the appointed day.In the past it was the practice that the Department responsible for a Government Bill affecting Ireland should furnish a draft of the Bill to this Office before its introduction. In many cases this practice has not been followed recently, and the result has been that Bills have been introduced in which the effect of the Government of Ireland Act has been ignored.FRANCIS N. GREER.June 30, 1921.[6529]
