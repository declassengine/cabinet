HUGHES ON THE IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE the complete speech delivered by Mr. Hughes in the Australian House of Representatives on the 7th April, from which a.summarised extract, dealing with the Anglo-Japanese Treaty and Naval Defence, was circulated on the 28th April.w. s. c.Colonial Office, June 22, 1921.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.Mr. Hughes (Bendigo Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [2-56].-(By leave.) I said yesterday that if public business permitted I would make to the House a statement in reference to a Conference which is to be held in London in June of this year, and to which the Prime Ministers of the overseas Dominions have been invited. It has been assumed by the press, and stated from the public platform, that this Conference has been called to consider changes in the Constitution. That is not the case. The Conference to consider alterations in the relations between the different parts of the Empire is to be held, possibly next year. The Conference to be held in June next is called to deal with certain definite matters, with which I shall deal in detail. In view of the fact that it is not proposed at this Conference to deal with constitutional relations between the various parts of the Empire any lengthy discussion in relation thereto would be out of place; but, having regard to what has been said on the subject, some few remarks from me seem to be called for.It would appear that those gentlemen who have rather severely criticised me for refraining to disclose what are my opinions in regard to the Constitution are profoundly dissatisfied with the Empire as it is. What they desire, if one is to deduce their intentions from their words, is to substitute for this structure, fashioned by time and circumstance, under which we have progressed and flourished! a structure empirical and illogical, but which is the most convenient and flexible ever conceived for the purposes of a free people -they, I say, desire to substitute a Constitution based on some logical plan which they themselves have devised. Precisely what that plan is we are not told, but if one is to read between the lines, they desire to create some sort of Imperial Parliament although I admit they repudiate that suggestion or, failing an Imperial Parliament, an Imperial Council, which, although, perhaps, not clothed with legislative powers, will have authority to deal with matters now entirely in the hands of the various Legislatures of the Empire. With these gentlemen I do not at all agree.* It appears to me that they are entirely ignorant of the historical, geographical, and ethnological principles and circumstances of the Empire. They do riot seem to understand that this thing which we call a Constitution if. we can apply so definite a term to a thing so indefinite is, happily for mankind, not the work of philosophers or Constitution-mongers has not been devised according to any plan, and has ^developed, not of deliberate purpose, but haphazard. There never was a time when this so-called Constitution of ours was crystallized. It is now, as it always was, in a state of flux. Its basic principles are the full and free recognition of the autonomy of the various parts of the Empire, and its complete adaptability to the changing circumstances of a progressive people. If we look back across our comparatively short history, and contract our relations with the Mother Country in the days of our infancy with those of to-day, we see great changes in form, but none in substance.  As our circumstances[6466]* H. Harrison Moore and Eggleston.B
have changed as we have progressed, authority and power suited to our requirements have been given to us. There was a time when the handful of people who were settled in this country were governed by nominee Councils under the direct control of the Colonial Office. When the Colonies had sufficiently advanced, independent self-government was granted them. Time passed, we grew from infancy to adolescents-acquiescence, and at last stood on the very threshold of manhood. With every advance our powers of self-government increased until at length, some twenty years ago, dignity and added authority were given to us by the Federal Constitution under which we are living to-day. During the five years of war our country progressed, and its circumstances changed more than in a generation of peace. In the supreme hour of the Empire trial the Dominions proved themselves worthy of their breeding. The whole world recognised that they had put on the toga of manhood and become nations. The nations of the world recognised us as their equals, and we were admitted into the League on a footing of equality. If we look at the form of the relations between Britain and ourselves during the interval that has elapsed since Australia was first settled, we see considerable changes, but in substance our relation remains the same. In my opinion, no constitutional changes are called for. Impartial history will record the fact that the British Constitution is the supreme achievement of the genius of our race for self-government. History may be ransacked in vain to find a parallel. If I were asked what is, as it were, the legal tie that unites the British Empire I say deliberately it is the King the Monarchy. 1 cannot conceive of a British Empire held together under any other form, oi government than a monarchy. The people of Australia would never consent to acknowledge as their ruler a President elected by the British people. The Monarchy is the constitutional principle which binds us together. Ties of race, of kindred, of common tradition, of language all these taken together go to weave that web which neither the storms of adversity nor the passage of time has been able to destroy; but if we are asked what is the material foundation of our greatness, what are we to say ? Upon what does this mighty Empire of ours rest? It rests, and always has done, upon the British Navy. As sure as we stand here this Empire of ours would never have been built without British control of the seas. By an all-powerful British Navy this Empire has been built up; only by a powerful British Navy can it be maintained. I leave all further reference to the Constitution at this point, which is the most convenient for dealing with the matters which are to be considered at the forthcoming Conference.The Conference has been summoned to deal with questions of foreign policy, naval defence, and the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty. Certain other more or less subsidiary matters are also set out on the agenda-paper.- One relates to communications, including wireless, between the various parts of the Empire, but I shall direct my remarks mainly to those matters which are of fundamental importance. I take, first of all, the question of foreign policy. The attitude of the Australian people towards foreign policy before the war was one of indifference, partly begotten from our geographical circumstances and our remoteness from those centres of population which were, in the very nature of things, regarded by us as being most potent in directing the affairs of the world. And our indifference arose, too, from another cause. We had lain so securely sheltered under the wing of the British Navy from the very day of the foundation of this country that not only did war, which devastated and destroyed other parts of the world, pass us by unscathed, but even rumours of war left us unaffected. The very completeness of the protection which the British Navy gave us was responsible for the fact that the Australian people took no heed of those things which vitally concerned other nations, bringing to them war, turmoil, and destruction, and those upheavals which have made history during the last 100 years. But the recent great war changed those conditions. Circumstances, to which I shall allude later, have now made it necessary that we shall take a keener interest in foreign policy. No one would have imagined that from the assassination of some obscure scion of a Royal house at Sarajevo, war could have come to this sea-girt Australia and to the whole world. If at that time you were to have put 100 Australians up against a wall and threatened to shoot every one who did not know where Sarajevo was, I suppose you would have had to shoot ninety-nine. Yet from such an incident out of a clear sky the greatest war in history was let,loose upon the world, and we, in distant Australia, were involved. It is a far cry from Australia to Belgium, yet but for the violation of the treaty of neutrality made by the Great Powers with Belgium, a treaty of which the over-whelming majority of Australians were in entire ignorance, England would prob-ably not have gone to war on the 4th August, 1914, and if she had not gone to war
/the whole history of the struggle would have been changed. As a result of 400,000 of our young men leaving this country, they have seen and learned many things of foreign countries, and their kindred have been naturally keenly interested in all the movements on that great stage upon which our soldiers were playing so splendid a part. We have at length become alive to the fact that in the modern world no nation can afford to be indifferent to what other nations do, and that war may come upon us from the most unexpected quarter and upon the most trivial pretext. We cannot afford to ignore the foreign policy of other nations of our own Empire. Honourable members know very well that from the beginning the foreign policy of the Empire has been determined exclusively by Britain, and, very properly so, for if the Empire became involved in war, it was mainly on the shoulders of the British people that the burden of war fell; it was certainly upon them that the burden of preserving the security of the Empire fell, whether in times of peace or in war. This brings me to one of the points to which I desire to direct the attention of honourable members. Certain matters relating tq the foreign policy of the Empire are to be considered at this June Conference. We have been invited by the British Government to take our part in the councils of Empire, and; to express our opinion In regard to these matters which it is now clearly understood involve us as much as any other part of the Empire. I shall come later to a consideration of what phase of foreign policy most intimately affects us. At this stage I turn to the question which is so inti-matelv related to it, that of defence. .To sea power we owe all that we have our freedom, our glorious heritage, the glittering promise of our great destiny. From the day Australia was founded to the present time we have been a free community, enjoying all those privileges for which the people of Britain fought for centuries, and, having achieved, applied to the varying circumstances of a world-wide Empire. There is no privilege or liberty that the British people enjoy they have not freely handed to us. And, securely sheltered under the broad wing of the mighty British Navy, we have been able to maintain those liberties and that freedom to develop our heritage and enjoy bless-ings in overwhelming measure of free government. And, as I have said, all this-our wealth, our liberties rests upon the broad and sure foundation of sea power. This brings me to the point I wish to particularly direct the attention of this House and the country.Quite recently a statement was made by the British Government of most porten-tous character, so far as Australia and the Empire are concerned. It was that Britain was no longer able to maintain the navy at the strength necessary for the complete protection of the Empire, and that the Dominions must do their share. We ought not to be surprised at this declaration, because during the great war Great Britain incurred a debt of some  7,000,000,000 or  8,000,000,000. She is still staggering under the tremendous blows received during the conflict; she is exposed to the fiercest industrial and commercial competition; she is torn with industrial strife by internecine struggles. Her people are demanding, quite rightly, that attention should be paid to domestic reform, that expenditure on naval and military defence should be reduced. No exception can be taken to this from the standpoint of the British people, but what does this mean to Australia ? We are 5.000,000 of people, we have a continent very rich and capable of almost infinite development, but within a few weeks&apos; sail of the great bulk of the population of the world. We have boldly announced that we intend to retain this continent for ourselves, and we have set up the banner of a White Australia. The Overwhelming majority of the people of Australia believe in this principle, but, in all the circumstances, it can hardly be expected that the overcrowded countries of the East can see the matter from our point of view. How long would that banner fly unless behind it there were massed the legions of the Empire, or unless ringed about it there was the protection of the British Navy? But we are now told deliberately that the British people can no longer maintain this Navy at a strength adequate for the defence of the Empire. To Rome there came a crisis similar to that which now confronts us. The Roman legions had invaded Britain and held it for some centuries, but the onslaught of the barbarians made it imperative that the oversea legions should be withdrawn in order to protect the citadel of the Empire. The Romans withdrew, and Britain was left to her own resources, with the result we know of. What can Australia do ? What is the Empire to do in this crisis? The position could hardly be graver. Last year we spent  3,352,000 or thereabouts on our Navy. It is only fair to Australia to point out that we have spent on naval defence very much more than all the Dominions put together; but our Navy is ludicrously inadequate to defend this country. We cannot defend ourselves. We have not even a plan of campaign for the Pacific. [G466] B -2
Quite recently a Conference was held at Singapore, which the Admiral of the Australian Fleet attended, to consider the defence of that portion of the Pacific covered by the Australian Fleet and the China Squadron; but as yet no plan of operations has been agreed for the China Squadron, of the British Navy and ourselves. Sir, we are confronted with a position grave in the extreme. What are we to do ? What is our policy to be ? We depend for our very existence on the maintenance of the control of the sea by Britain. Britain says that she can no longer afford to maintain the Navy at its relative pre-war strength, and calls upon the Dominions to consider the question, and presumably to contribute their share. What are we going to do ? The Conference has been called to consider the question. Upon its decision rests the safety, the very existence of this Commonwealth, and, indeed, of the Empire itself. For just as the Empire was built up by and rests upon sea power, so will it wither and decay as that power slips from the hands of the British race.In order that we may the better understand all that is involved in any policy insuring effective naval defence of Australia, it is necessary to consider a matter most intimately related to it. I turn, therefore, to the consideration of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty. We live in a world which, thanks to the war, we know, or ought to know, very well. We are under no illusions. The veil has been torn from our eyes, and the purposes of nations have been revealed. One great menace to the -safety of mankind has been stricken down and humbled; but will anyone say that the war, which was waged to end war, has removed all danger of other wars? Has there been a day since the signing of the armistice, on the 11th November, 1918, when war has not raged somewhere ? I may be reminded of the existence of the League of Nations. I have never disguised my opinions of the League. Yet, because peace is a thing so greatly to be desired, I have endeavoured, by inducing Australia to become a member of the League, to enable it to exercise that influence upon the counsels and acts of nations which its. creators claimed for it. But what are the facts ? The League was created to banish war by creating a tribunal to which the nations could appeal, substituting reason for force. Yet within two days&apos; journey of Geneva, where its Assembly recently sat, war was raging, in which two members of the League were involved. In the long list of resolutions of the Assembly there is not the briefest reference to the fact that the thunders of war, which the League was to banish from the earth for ever, were shaking the earth almost at its very doors. If, then, any Australian is asked whether he will trust his fortunes to the League of Nations or to the sea power of the British Empire, will he hesitate for one moment in his answer ? Let us not throw away the substance for the shadow. The war was to have changed many things, and has done so; but how deep does the change go ? Has it changed the hearts of men ? Do they now seek to settle their quarrels by an appeal to reason instead of to force ? If not, the change is only skin deep, and war is still the one great dominating fact of national life. Long ago it was said by Marcus Aurelius: &quot; Wouldst thou confer upon any country the clouds of war, then induce its Government to disarm.&quot; Is it not clear that if we are to have peace, and that security which is essential to the development of our heritage, we cannot rely either on the League of Nations or on ourselves alone ? Are our resources and our numbers such as could in any circumstances insure adequate defence? We must confess frankly that they are not. We speak at times boast-ingly I, perhaps, have led the vanguard in this. We speak of ourselves as a nation, and our claim to be recognised as a nation does not rest merely on our own claim. For the nations have admitted us to their councils on a footing of equality. We are a nation. But let us not be vainglorious or blown out with conceit. We are a nation only by the grace of God and the power of the British Empire. But for these our house, splendid and glorious though it is, would be as a house built upon quicksands! If the British people as ed, &quot;What is the Empire to us? Will it feed, or clothe, or help us ? Let us look to our own affairs &quot; ; would they not be well within their own rights ? Why should they spend their money to defend us ? What do they gain from us ? I do not ask, what do we gain from them, because our gain is obvious. They might say: &quot;Let us look to ourselves.&quot; A Navy incomparably smaller than that required to police this mighty Empire would suffice to protect Great Britain itself. But in that case what of us I speak not of the other parts pf the Empire, but of Australia, which stands as a free nation on the foundation of sea power, and on that alone. At this Conference our circumstances and those of the whole Empire must be placed before the people of Great Britain. In these days much is heard of economy, and the outcry for it has not come too soon. But it is heard, not in this country alone, but in all countries, and is the natural consequence
of the reckless but inevitable extravagance of the war. If Great Britain chooses to economise, and commences with her Navy, how will it go with us? What shall we do ?I come now to deal more in detail with the Anglo-Japanese Treaty. This Treaty would have expired last year, but was renewed for twelve months, in order that there might be an opportunity for its reconsideration.Mr. Watt. There was no definite renewal. Would it not be correct to say that it was allowed to continue?Mr. Hughes. It was allowed to continue; but it will expire.Mr. Watt. If notice is given. Either party may denounce it on the giving of certain notice.Mr. Hughes. Unless the Treaty is renewed, it may be terminated on the expiration of twelve months&apos; notice, and that will be given if it is not renewed. I need not dwell on the provisions of the Treaty, because they are sufficiently well known to honourable members. In effect, they provide for joint action in the Pacific by Great Britain and Japan. What that has meant to us, and what it means to the world at the present time, should be considered carefully by this Assembly. What it means to us is evident. If we were told that there was danger of war, we should naturally ask, from what quarter? Who threatens us? We are a peace-loving democracy. Whom have we assailed, or whom do we threaten? Is any nation less blood guilty than we ? Every citizen of Australia realises that the destiny of this country is to be played on the mighty stage of the Pacific. Therefore, when we speak of war and foreign policy, we speak of foreign policy in relation to Pacific problems and of war as it may come out of the East. No man can deny that it is a thing more precious than rubies that we should have an alliance with the greatest Power in the East; and no man who was not a criminal, who was not utterly dead to the duty that he owed to his country, would do anything that might involve this country in war. So, when we are asked what the Treaty means to us, either in its present or any other acceptable form, we are to say that it means everything to us. Eor we should recollect that it is an alliance between that Power, under whose wing we have been sheltered from the day of our birth till now, and that other great Eastern Power which has sprung up within the lifetime of honourable members of this House. So, in the face of these facts, if we are asked, are we in favour of a renewal of that Treaty, I take it that, as Australians who want peace, there can be but one answer, we are. We must recollect that we live in a glass house. We must not forget, though we speak boastingly and I am not chiding the Australian for so speaking, since he has much to boast of upon what pedestal we stand. We must remember that our greatness is due mainly due, at any rate to our occupancy of a pedestal which is not ours at all, but which has been given unto us for a century or more by Britain. What are the chances of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty being renewed ? What are the difficulties in the way ? These are the questions to which I must now invite the attention of honourable members. It is perfectly well known that the Japanese an ambitious and an intensely, passionately, patriotic people  have imagined that they have causes for quarrel, or, rather, of complaint, with ourselves because of our policy of a White Australia. And, as we have seen lately, there has been much talk of strained relations between the United States of America and Japan. Now, in this, last lie the germs of great trouble, the possibilities of infinite disaster to this world. What is the hope of mankind? What do thinking men everywhere strive and pray for? Peace on earth. And how is, this to be secured? This is no party question. I hope that every honourable member will . express himself freely, remembering only that every word said here in relation to other nations is one which must be well weighed before being uttered. Words of counsel I welcome; words of warning, too; but not words which, lightly uttered, would make a task that is now sufficiently difficult, almost impossible. What is the hope of the world ? As I see it, it is an alliance, an understanding, call it what you will, between the two great branches of the English-speaking peoples. Now, here is our dilemma. Our interests, our safety lies in a renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty. Yet that treaty is anathema to the Americans. An honourable member at my right, who dissents, has his own opinion; he may be more intimately acquainted than myself with the viewpoint of the American people; I hope he is. We read almost every day of disturbing rumours of great navies, the world longing for peace resounds with the clanging of hammers, fervently building more and more warships, and there is rivalry openly expressed between those two great nations, the United States of America and Japan.  America has said that she must have the greatest
navy in the world; that she must have a navy sufficiently strong to defend herself. To defend herself against whom \ She has left the world in no doubt, or in very little, on this point. And these things concern and disturb us greatly. For we not only have no quarrel with America, but we have no quarrel with Japan. We have our ideals; Japan has hers. There is room in the world for both of us. We want to live in terms of amity with all the nations of the earth. If I know the Australian people, they desire with all their hearts to concentrate themselves on those domestic problems which mean mdre to the people of the world than anything else. War is a curse, and we must do all things within our power to endeavour to prevent it. What is the ideal at which we are to aim at this Conference, and elsewhere, by every means at our disposal? It is, as I see it, a renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty in such form modified, if that should be deemed proper-as will be acceptable to Britain,, to America, to Japan, and to ourselves. That is the ideal. Tt may be said that is* impossible. It may be. I do not think so. When one comes to the alleged causes of. the disputes between Japan and America, they appear to be trivial compared with the tremendous evil which war would inflict upon both nations. What do the Japanese want ? They want the right to hold land in America, the right of entry for such of their nationals as so desire into the United States. What is our own attitude ? For our attitude is very much like that of the people of the western States of America towards Japan. Indeed, any honourable member who, like myself, has been to the western States will say that for all practical purposes we view this problem almost eye to eye. What have the Japanese to complain of in regard to our treatment? First, Jet me say speaking now, as I believe, as the spokesman of Australia upon this matter that we desire above all things to live in peace and friendship with Japan. It is utterly wrong for the Japanese people to think that because we have passed certain laws we. regard them as our inferiors. We do not. We admire their bravery, their splendid patriotism. We stand among those who are loudest in admiration of their magnificent achievements;&apos;for no other nation has advanced so far in so short a time. But. as I had the honour of telling the repre-sentative of Japan at the Peace Conference, while we were the friends of Japan, and while we considered them the equal to ourselves, we do not always invite all our friends into our house. We have our ideals; they have theirs. And I want the Japanese people to understand clearly that we, the Australian people, are anxious to live in peace and friendship with them. If they complain of any act of ours, I think they complain without reason. Let me remind them of their laws in relation to foreigners. No foreigner may hold land in Japan. Unskilled labourers may not reside outside the foreign settlements, except with the permission of the Prefectual Government. For all practical purposes, the foreign labourer is excluded; and,, under the provision to which I have just alluded, Chinese have been deported from Japan. Naturalisation is extremely difficult, if not impossible, in Japan other than by marriage with a Japanese person. Japan reserves her coasting trade for her own ships. Our treatment of the Japanese will compare quite favourably, I think, with their treatment of foreigners in general. We do not complain of her treatment of our nationals. We say, &quot;Those are our ideals. . This is our country; Japan is yours. We shall treat you with courtesy. We desire your friendship. We want to trade wdth you. But we cannot go any further.&quot; The Japanese are so intensely patriotic that they do not recognise naturalisation by any country as denationalising any Japanese. A Japanese, no matter what he does, cannot divest himself of his nationality. The patriotism of the Japanese could not be displayed in any more effective way. The admission of Japanese labour, the right to hold land : These are the main grounds of the. differences of opinion between the United States of America and Japan. Do honourable members tell me that such matters as these are not capable of adjustment by peace-loving nations? Do they not rather tell me that it&apos; is the bounden duty of Australia to use every means at her disposal to effect such a modus vivendi as will secure a renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty in a form acceptable to Japan and the United States of America? Whether she is a party to, it or not is not material so long as she does not regard the renewal of it as an unfriendly act by Britain directed against herself. For this is the dilemma in which we are placed. While making every effort to retain the friendship of Japan we cannot make an enemy of the United States of America. Nor can Britain do so. We must steer our barque between Scylla and Charybdis. In some way we must-attain the calm waters of port. That is the mission which the representative of Australia has to fulfil.I have put the matter to the House as well as I could, and even if I laboured it at greater length I do not think I could make it clearer. I hope that honourable members will realise quite clearly that, treaty or no treaty, the power of the British
oNavy whether it be an Imperial Navy to which we contribute substantially or not is the foundation of our greatness, the greatest assurance of the peace of the world, and must remain. If that Navy should sink to the level of a second-class Power, then no treaty is worth the paper it is printed on. Sea-power is the founda-tion, not only of our greatness, but of our very existence. Let the teachings of history guide your feet. Be not deluded by phrases or by vain hopes. There is but one way by which this Empire has been built up, and by that way only can it be maintained. As for the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, if we consider the question from the standpoint of Australia, and ask ourselves what we have to gain by its renewal, the answer is plain; we have everything to gain. If we cannot secure a satisfactory treaty, then it is obvious that any adequate scheme of naval defence will involve us in much greater expenditure, and this at a time when our resources are strained to the uttermost. As I have already said, there is much cry at the present time about economy. This is a direction in which economy can most hopefully look for success. A satisfactory treaty would lessen the expenditure of Australia by millions per annum. Failure would throw upon us obligations that I venture to say could hardly be shouldered by 5,000,000 of people.This, then, is the position as I see it. It may be put in a more favourable light; but I have put it fairly, neither exaggerating the difficulties nor minimising them. I have set them out so that men may see and judge for themselves just where they stand. The question of what is adequate naval defence for Australia I mean, of course, a naval scheme in which Australia co-operates w7ith Britain, and not a scheme in which Australia assumes the sole responsibility, since that could not be thought of depends on the outcome of this Conference. Can we make such a satisfactory treaty with Japan as will be acceptable to Britain and America ? That is the point. One might easily say more than one should on this matter, but I think that I ought not to have said less than I have. I have endeavoured to put the issues fairly, and I leave it to honourable members to say whether or not Australia should be represented at such a Conference. Whatever may be true of Canada and, so far as I know, all the other Dominions are to be. represented Australia has the most to lose and the most to gain at that Conference. Canada&apos;s position is different from our own. We have a coastline nearly three times as great as that of the United States of America, comparing mainland with mainland, and, if we add her depen-tendencies and include our own, the proportion is undisturbed. We are vulnerable on every side. Canada&apos;s boundaries, on the other hand, extend for 3,000 miles along the great American Republic. It is inconceivable that the United States of America should attack Canada. The utmost good feeling prevails between the two peoples, Canada is vulnerable on only one side, because on the other the British Fleet is always within a few days&apos; steaming distance. We, however, are at the extremities of the earth, and nothing but a scheme of naval defence adequate to &quot; circumstances of the then existing foreign policy, whatever that may be, will suffice.If I am asked whether the Commonwealth is to be committed to anything done at the Conference, I say quite frankly that this Parliament will have the amplest opportunity of expressing its opinion on any scheme of naval defence that is decided upon before the scheme is ratified. As to the renewal of the Treaty with Japan, this is my attitude, and I submit it for the consideration of honourable members: I am in favour of renewing the Treaty in any form that is satisfactory to Britain, America and ourselves. I am prepared to renew, it in those circumstances. If it is suggested that the renewal should take a form which would involve the sacrifice of those principles, which we ourselves regard as sacred, I am not prepared to accept it. In such circumstances, I shall bring back the Treaty to this Parliament. I think I have put the situation fairly, and since these matters have sometimes to be settled quickly, I want honourable members to say whether they will give me the authority I ask for. With regard to the expenditure involved in any naval scheme, the House will not be committed to the extent of one penny. The scheme will be brought before Parliament, and honourable members will be able to discuss, and accept or reject it. If honourable members say that we ought to accept the Treaty in any form, whether it involves the sacrifice of those principles in which we believe or not, I cannot agree; but I am prepared to agree to anything short of that.I have a copy of the mandate given to us over German New Guinea and all the ex-German places south of the Equator, excepting Samoa, and, in order to enable the whole matter to be1 debated, I move That the paper be printed.
