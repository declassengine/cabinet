Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty

With reference to Cabinet 43 (21) Conclusion 2.D. I circulate for the information of my Colleagues a Memorandum, with appendices, showing the assistance given by the Japanese in Naval operations of the late war.



                                                                (Intlld.) L of F.

                                                                   June 17th, 1921.



The Japanese in the war carried out their obligations under the Alliance, and gave the Naval assistance which we asked them to provide. During the first half of the war period it was not our policy to ask them for naval help outside the Pacific.

There was a certain hesitation on the part of the Japanese to comply with our request for Naval assistance in the Mediterranean in 1917-18. The greater part of the expenses of this assistance was paid by this country. On the conclusion of the war the Japanese vessels engaged on this duty were thanked for their work, which was undoubtedly efficiently and well performed.

In general, it may be said that Japanese Naval assistance in so far as it conformed to direct Japanese interests, was freely and willingly given. Where, however, the object to be attained did not especially further the policy of Japan, a certain amount of persuasion was necessary to induce her to undertake the required commitments.

Attached are two appendices :

 (i) A precis of the actual work done by the Japanese Naval forces in the war.



 (ii) A letter from the C-in-C., China Station written in 1917.


326APPENDIX I.JAPAN,NAVAL EFFORT.Japan&apos;g Naval effort treated under the following heads:-(a) Tslng Tao 1914.(b) Operations against German Cruisers and German Islands &quot;in Pacific 1914.(c) Operations in Mediterranean 1917-18.(d) Operations based on Cape Station 1917-18. (q) Operations based on Honolulu 1917-18.(f) Miscellaneous operations, principally based on Singapore.(g) Vladivostok.Of the above (d), (e) and (f) gave rise to no opportunity to engage the enemy, but although the results are but negative, the patrols established and the precautionary measures taken   were considered necessary, and were, as far as reported, efficiently carried out.The period during which each ship was engaged on each - operation she performed is not exactly known and is therefore recorded to the nearest month only.   The number of miles steamed can only &quot;pe ascertained by application to the Japanese Navy Dept.   The number and class of ships engaged in each of the operations classified above, vary from time to time in each operation. Therefore the effort has been measured in each case in ship-month units.   In similar fashion the personnel effort la measur-ed, in so far as it can be assessed, in man-month units.TSING TAO 1914.   Nature of Operations.     To convoy a military force for a land attack on Tsing Tao, to maintain its communications with Japan, to blockade Tsing Tao and assist by bombardment from sea in its reduction.   Except on one occasion when a destroyer broke out from Tsing Tao, no enemy naval forces were encountered.   The operations consisted in (a) patrolling,   (b) minesweeping, (c) long range bombardment of forts.   The operations were not of a .......
of a strenuous nature.Result;-   The capture of Tsing Tao.Approximate duration of operations:-   August 27th 1914 to November 16th 1914,   The actual siege lasted just over ten weeks.

Naval assistance was roquested.   nCadmusu, the only British ship in harbour, landed*i every available man (about 115) and W/T calls were sent to two-Japanese Light Cruisers.   One of these arrived on February 17th and landed 5 officers and 75 men.   The other arrived on Februaryj 18th and landed 5 officers and 78 men.   All re-embarked on February 25th.   The Japanese Consul organised a force of about. 190 local, residents who were armed by the British Military Authorities.   The Japanese Naval Party assisted in patrolling and/grounding pp stragglers.   The civilian party assisted the special police in maintaining order.British Naval Casualties were 1 killed, No Japanese Casualties are reported.OPERATIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN 1917-18,These consisted almost entirely in convoying with con-i sequent anti-submarine work.   Some ten cases of actual engagements \ with submarines have been considered of sufficient interest to I merit a special report, but in none of them was the enemy adjudged j to have been destroyed.   No adverse criticism on efficiency has been j reported.   Rescue work, particularly in the case of &quot;Transylvania&quot;(4517), has been promptly carried out.EFFORT.SHIPS NUMBER SHIP-MONTH,Cruiser        ... 2 ... 21Destroyer      ... 12 ... 236In addition, two British Destroyers and two British trawlerswere manned by Japanese crews,PERSONNEL MEN-MONTHS,17,853.

The searching of ships, removal of enemy persons and agents and removal and examination of mails were not, however, carried out by Japanese ships, it being considered undesirable for political reasons to entrust them with these tasks.   Further they adhered to a very narrow interpretation of the &quot;Declaration of London&quot;.   Searches for possible raiders and precautio nary patrols against raiders were carried out, extending to the coasts of Australia, New Zealand,^1.and the Netherlands East Indies and out into the Pacific.
Various trips to escort Destroyers to the Mediterranean; trips between Australia and Colombo escorting troopships when a raider was known to be out; and a trip across the Pacific conveying bullion-from-Vladivostok to Vancouver are included.   No palpable result was obtained, but all operations are reported to have been carried out efficiently.EFFORTSHIPSCruisers Light Cn DestroyersPERSONNELLight Cruisers ...* * *NUMBER5 10 16,  0  ,, , ,SHIP-MONTHS83 156 245MEN-MONTHS118,840,CasualtiesNone reported.Operations to protect allied property at Vladivostok and to restore order at that place and in the River Amur 1918, Result:-     Object attained.EFFORTSHIPS NUMBERBattleship (old) 3Battlecruiser (small)          1Cruiser ...             1Light Cruiser .,             1Destroyer ...             4PERSONNELSHIP-MONTHS, 183 3 3 36MEN-MONTHS, 22,035Casualties:-   None reported.
^1 &quot; APPENDIX  II. 331SECESTNo. 6/505. Commander in Chiefs Office,China Station,Singapore, 5th January, 1917.Sir,Be pleased to submit the following remarks upon Japaneso naval characteristics and the possibility of effective co-operation between us and them to The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty as a matter affecting the efficient protection of commerce in the present war and of very great interest when considering the future of the Japanese aa a great naval power.2.-      The particular traits which have come to light and which render co-operation with them a matter of extreme difficulty and requiring abnormal patience are :-(a) Their failure to appreciate that we are in a state of war, their disregard of the precautionary measures necessary owing to that state of war, and their inability to act promptly,(b) Their apparent impression that it is derogatory to take orders -    or even act on requests from foreign officers.(c) Their inability effectively to adapt, organise, and control, on their own initiative, the new methodc imposed by scientific naval progress.To deal with, these points in detail (a); results in a failure to appreciate the necessity for and a consequent disregard of war regulations, and a dilatoriness which makes it unwise to rely on their effectively carrying out orders when received, at any rate so far as the precautionary period is concerned, and has caused continual trouble owing to their endeavouring to evade or wilfully disobeying port orders.    One destroyer was fired at with a 6-inch projectile at Hong Kong and the same would have happened here on two or three occasions had the beats not been known.   Matters become better by means of protests and letters but immediately recur on the arrival of new vessels &apos; on the station.   Admiral Nomaguchi has explained that their/   destroyer officers are &quot;pirates&quot; but it is not confined toThe Secretary, Demroyer/Admiralty, S.W.
 IE! 332Destroyer  off icon;, and in any case this is little satisfaction to those concerned in enforcing rorul:tions lor the safety of the ports.Orders or &quot;requests&quot; to 70 to sea, if emanating from myself and even ii imported by their own Admiral, he not beinff.present, are liable to fce met with excuses and delay,(h)      It has been m.ide apparent to me that it is not ooasidorec correct for Japanese naval officers to ti5--e orders from foreign officers.    The Japanese captains have always been cordial to a degree, evidently desirous to meet my wishes and they have always done so, but they appear to be hritoperetf by unexpressed limitations ::nd by a fear of the disapproval of their Admiral -or Admiralty.This introduces an element of uncertainty in dealing with them which precludes freedom and promptness in action and ren&amp;ors it necessary to use circumspection when conveying requests for action to them,  In fact, when possible such requests, with reasons, must go through the Admiral, even if for distant, or failing him, even through the Admiralty in certain cases.  If such communications were promptly replied to it mi $it not be so bad, but it is impossible to tell how many days may elapse before a reply is received.The attitude of the Japanese in this respect is very-far removed from that ol the French and Russians with whom I have hoi dealings.Vj relations with Admiral Nomagiichi v?ere excellent, but I do not think he ever really forgot he was my senior and his brnn at any rate was very slow wording,  tith Admiral Omxri 7ith his western training matters will, I fancy, be easier and far more satisfactory in all respects.(c) is manifested chiefly with regard to vireless and signalling generallycJapanese ships lyinr here in the past h ive shewn an amazing lack of courtesy, bloc^inr. my sirnals from the ./T station for hours at a time while endeavouring to ret their&apos; om off.  It
&apos; &apos; &apos;    3 - 333has only been by pointing out our regulations, and definitely stating by letter that these regulations, with certain concessions must be adhered to, that they have at last been gradually brought into line when in British harbours.What happens at sea it is impossible to say.   Their operators take charge and make what messages they like and how they like, with apparently no control whatever.As instances, among many, of stupidity I would mention the&quot;NIITAKA&quot; which having been given a secret call sign made thatcall-sign followed by MI am NIITAKA&quot; to the-W/T station at Penangwithin twenty-four hours of receiving it.   In another case the&quot;VENUS&quot; when off Amoy was heard by a Japanese ship which at once&quot;British ship, why don&apos;t you answer, where are you?&quot;, began : &quot;British ship, who are you?&quot;,/etc etc.     The JapaneseAdmiral being away, I pointed out privately to the JapaneseAdmiralty, through our Naval Attache, that such signalling placesour ships in quite an impossible position as they have directorders to communicate with no one except in code etc, etc, andthe Japanese Admiralty have replied that such signalling is quiteirregular:   but I have not much hope that matters will improve.Our codes for communication with the Japanese, i.e. theAllied Fleet Signal Book and the Allied Fleet Telegraphic Code,are very inefficient and difficult, and I am afraid beyond them,but I fear difficulty would be experienced with any code for communication between them and -us.    The present best coursetherefore is to place them so far as possible together so thatthey&quot; can communicate between themselves and to hope that in doing so they will not render communication quite impossible for us.3.-      As a further indication of Japanese methods I may mention that I have had to point out through our Naval Attache at Tokyo that Officers sent to Hong Kong and Singapore as Intelligence Officers and to act as &quot;go-betweens&quot; between the Japanese and&apos;ourselves should have some knowledge of English and no/c be sent merely to enable them to learn English. .
vice admiral.4.-     In writing this my. main object is to give Their Lordships some idea of the difficulties which our ships have to contend with when acting with the Japanese..   I fully recognise and appreciate the necessity of securing Japanese assistance, and have done my best to secure some intelligent co-operation, but should extended and joint action become necessary, I fear the results may not be quite all that could be desired.The Japanese appear to have no initiative whatever, but can copy, and though I naturally communicate nothing more as &amp;o our methods than is absolutely necessary, I fear we are teaching them a great deal of which they were amazingly ignorant.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant, sd.    W. L. Grant.
