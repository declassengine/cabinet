Six members of the band&apos;-were killed outright by the explosion and sixteen were wounded, one mortallysix -of the victims, including three of those killed,.being bandboyev- The number of men concerned in the actual carrying out of this outrage, was probably smallj and all succeeded in effecting their escape,-but
but the district was afterwards thoroughly scoured by the police and military and several arrests were made on suspicion, The majority of the police casualties of the week were also due to ambushes.   On the 1st instant a police patrol was ambushed at Clonniore, Kill or gl in District, Co,Kerry, and four of its members (including a District Inspector and a Sergeant) were shot dead and three were wounded.

Opinion in the Sotith appears to be almost unanimously in favour of a further exchange of views between Mr. de Valera and Sir James Craig. and this in my view would be the most hopeful indication that a change for the better is to be-looked for in tho near futurev     It is satisfactory to note &quot;that the Unionist triumph in the North has not given rise to any undue exultation in victory0&apos;    Ire Ulster press is, for the most part, studiously moderate in its tone and echoes the desire expressed by Sir James Craig &quot;that the South and West may now join with the North in grappling with the machinery of the Aot and so work out the salvation of the whole country&quot;,(Intd)     HtfGuIrish Office,Old Queen Street, S II 1 &quot;vthVune-1921,
