MANDATES.Lottor from tho Acting President of the Counoil of tho Loaguo of Nations to tho  Prinoipal Alliod Powers.PARIS, Juno 15th,, 1921.I havo the honour, in my oapaoity as President for tho time boing of tho Counoil of the Leaguo of Nations, to call your attention to the fact that the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;3&quot; Handles are on the Agenda of the next Counoil lieoting, fixed for tho 17th June-    You will no doubt remember that these Mandates wore on the Agonda of the last mooting in February, but that discussion of thorn was adjourned after the recoipt of a Note from tho Government of the United States of America,, to the effect that it oould not aooopt any docision on this question oome to without Its approval..    It pointed out that since the Colonies and Territories whioh as a oonsequenoe of the late war had oeased to- be under the sovereignty of the States which formerly governed them had been coded by the peace Treaty to the Allied and Associated Powers, no allocation of Mandates over these Colonies and territories oould be valid without the formal approval of the United States.-    Tho United Strtes Government, moreoverj held that it had never given such approval.The Counoil was ol/opinion that tho question thus raised by the Government of the United btates did not directly concern the League of Nations,, but should be the subject of negotiations between the Principal Allied and associated Powers, sinoe theso Colonies and Territories had, as a matter of foot, been coded to the Principal Allied and Associate- Powers and not to the Leaguo of Nations.The action of the Council of the League oould thus only begin with the definition by the Council of the terns of the Mandates after the Mandates were finally allocated to the Mandatory Powers..
f) ^ VThe Counoil of the Leaguo of Nations does not doubt that all the Allied and Associated Powers are equally animated by the desire to assure, at the earliest possible moment, to the populations coming under the Mandatory eystemj the conditions of security, prosperity, and regular development to which they arc entitled under the Covenant.    They will, therefore, no doubt recognise that it is necessary to substitute   as early as possible, the system of Mandates, under which the rights and duties of the parties are clearly defined, for tho somewhat strict system of military occupation and administration which1 is a natural sequel of the war.    On the other hand, the Allied and Associated Powers will understand that the Council of the Leaigue of Nations prefers not to exercise the functions conferred upon it by Article 22 of the Covenant so long as the conditions requisite to the exercise of these functions ha&apos;?e not been completely fulfilled, and particularly so long a3 the title of the Mandatory Powers to exeoute one Mandate has not been accepted and defined as the result of a complete agreement between the Principal Allied and Associated Powers,I therefore venture to ask the Principal Allied Powers to he good enough to make every effort to arrive at a solution of the points under discussion between them and the United States, so as to enable the Council of the League of Nations to settle the whole question of Mandates before the next Meeting of the Assembly.1 venture to express to the Allied Governments my hope that even if an agreement cannot immediately be come to on every point under disoussion between them and the United States Government, they will nevertheless agree that it is eminently desirable that the Council of the League should without further delay he placed in a position to fulfil its responsibilities for the well-being and prosperity of the populations of the different Mandated Territories.
Any indications from tho Allied and Associated Powers suoh as I havo just referred to, to the effeot that tho league will do plaoed in a position to accomplish its task at the earliest possible date, will I am convinced bo warmly welcomed by tho Council. .The Council of tho League of Nations considers it essential that tho Allied Powers should before the nest Assembly arrive at a complete agreement with the Government of the United States of America in order that the Council may, by defining the terns of tho Mandates, fulfil one of the ohiof responsibilities laid upon it by the Covenant.(Sgd)        G. da CUNHA.
