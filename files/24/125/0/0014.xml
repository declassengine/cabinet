Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,The Imperial Shipping Committee, which contains representatives   of     India and the Dominions as well as of the Home Departments and representatives of shipping and commerce, have recommended unanimously that steps should be, taken to secure the passing of uniform legislation In the various parts of the Empire on the subject of the limitation of shipowners&apos;liability.   Put shortly, the object la to prevent shipowners contracting out of certain liabilities with regard to the carriage of goods.   Representatives of cargo owners and underwriters have pressed strongly for legislation on these lines for some years past, but it has hitherto been opposed by shipowners.   The report of the Imperial Shipping Committee recommending legislation is signed by the shipowners8 representatives as well as &quot;by the others, and there is not likely to be any serious opposition,The Dominions will expect the United Kingdom to take the lead, and I would propose that when this question, which is on the agenda for the Imperial Cabinet, comes up for discussion a statement should be made that His Majesty1s Government are prepared to introduce legislation next Session on the lines recommended by the Imperial Shipping Committee.   As it is essential that the legislation should be uniform throughout the Empire, a clause will be inserted^ In the Bill to the effect that it will come into operation as soon as the principal Dominions have passed similar legislate(Intd. ) S.B.3rd.June, 1921.
