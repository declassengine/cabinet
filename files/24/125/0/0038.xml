PART I.-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The position in the coal mining industry has changed rapidly during the week. The rejection by the miners on the 3rd June of the Governments proposals of the 28th May was followed by the Prime Ministers intimation that the Governmenfs offer of a grant of  10,000,000 to enable the industry to tide over the present period of depression would only remain open for another fortnight; and on the morning of the 4th the prospects of an early settlement of the dispute seemed remote. Representatives of the owners, how-ever, met the Executive Committee of the Miners&apos; Federation on the 6th, 7th and 8th, to discuss further proposals of the owners; and the miners&apos; executive have called a special delegate conference of the Federation for the 10th, at which the proposals of the owners and the Government will be considered. It is also announced that the executive will recommend to the conference that a ballot vote of the members upon these proposals should be taken. It may he pointed out that on the 3rd June the Governmenfs proposals were rejected by the miners&apos; executive, after receiving reports from, the districts, without calling a Special Delegate Conference, and as these proposals have not been modified in any way, the change in the situation would appear to be due to fresh proposals by the owners, which the executive deem to be worthy of the serious consideration of the rank and file.The suspension of sympathetic action in support of the miners is now complete. Work was resumed at the Glasgow docks on the 6th June ; and arrangements have been made for the gradual reinstatement of the men who struck at the Greenwich power station.The general industrial situation continues to be grave. Particulars are given below of the developments in the cotton textile industry, in which there was a general cessation of work on the 4th June, and in the woollen textile and the engineering industries. In the industry last named, notices of the proposed reductions in wages, to take effect from the 16th June, were posted by the employers on the 7th. The Minister met representatives of the employers and the workpeople on the same day, and will also meet the employers again on the 8th, but the danger of a general stoppage is still considerable.The position as regards transport workers appears to be easier. At the joint con-ference which was held at Montagu House on the 3rd June, a sub-committee representative of employers and workpeople in the road transport industry was appointed to investigate conditions in that industry, and to present a report to a future meeting. The strike of ships&apos; cooks and stewards was cancelled on the 3rd June, the union apparently realising that it was useless to continue the struggle in the absence of assistance from the other seamen&apos;s unions.The cumulative effect on other industries of the continuance of the coal dispute is shown by the steady increase in unemployment. The resulting serious depletion of the Unemployment Insurance Fund has been widely discussed during the week, and the Minister will introduce into the House of Commons on the 8th June, a Bill, entitled the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Bill, &quot; to vary the rates of contribution and the rates and periods of benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, 1920 and 1921, and otherwise to amend those Acts.&quot;A decision of the Government which is of considerable importance from the point of view of the agricultural worker was announced in both Houses of Parliament, on the 8th June. The Government have come to the conclusion that the financial liability on the State under Part I of the Agriculture Act is more than the country can afford in present circumstances, and, consequently, that there is no alternative but to terminate, at the earliest possible date, the policy guaranteeing minimum prices for wheat and oats. This decision involves also the repeal of the provisions relating to minimum wages for agricultural workers.The annual meeting of the general Council of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federa-tion will be held at Edinburgh on the 9th and 10th June, and the annual general meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen at Newcastle on the 4th July. A World Cotton Conference will be held in Liverpool and Manchester, under the presidency of Lord Emmott, from the 13th to the 22nd.
General Situation-continued, The Unemployment Position.Statistics. On the 27th May, in the United Kingdom, 2,103,782 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,553,091 were lodged by males and 550,691 by females. At the same date 1,188,397 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 608,485 were lodged by males and 579,912 by females.These figures show an increase on the previous week of 66,565 totally unemployed and 7,319 working short time.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 3rd June was 2,147,400. The above are advanced figures provided by the Employment Department and are subject to revision.A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 487.FEATURES OF THE WEEK.Industrial and Other Organisations.Amalgamated Union of Shipbuilding, Engineering and Constructional Workers. At a meeting held at Jarrow, on the 30th May, of boilermakers employed on Tyneside, the question of the amalgamation of the Associated Blacksmiths&apos; and Ironworkers&apos; Society, the Ship Constructors and Shipwrights&apos; Association, and the United Society of Boilermakers and Iron and Steel Shipbuilders, was discussed. The proposal to form the amalgamation was brought forward about two years ago, and a committee was appointed to formulate rules and a constitution. These have now been completed, and the constituent members are to be asked to ratify the rules. The amalgamation, although not officially constituted, has been in operation for about a year, and the boilermakers assert that it has proved to be unworkable for trade union purposes.Opposition is also being raised to the arrangements for the pooling of funds; the boilermakers&apos; society consider that they are contributing too large a share, as, in member-ship, they outnumber the other societies combined, and, in addition, are paying into the amalgamated funds about  5 per member as against  4 by the shipwrights&apos; society and  3 by the blacksmiths&apos; society. Opposition to the amalgamation is reported to be very strong, and it is stated that a large section of the boilermakers are proposing to seek an injunction against the rules becoming operative.Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen. The annual report of this society, which has just been received, gives some striking figures of the growth of the society during 1920. The membership of the society increased from 57,184 at the end of 1919, to 71,344 at the end of 1920, and the income by  49,748 during the same period. The reserve capital of the society at the end of 1920 amounted to  256,468.National Foremen&apos;s Association. Some record of the development and activities of this association is contained in the annual report which has recently been issued. The report shows that the membership has increased from 550 in October, 1917, when the association was formed, to 3,000 at the present time. One of the most important activities of the association has been the establishment of agreements with organisations of manual workers, including the Amalgamated Union of Shipbuilding, Engineering, and Construc-tional Workers, * and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and also with the National Union of Clerks. Negotiations are now proceeding with engineer-ing unions for similar agreements. The association have recently become affiliated to the Trades Union Congress, the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, and the National Federation of Professional, Technical, Administrative, and Supervisory Workers, and an effort is being made to form into one corporation all the organisations catering for foremen, e.g., the National Foremen&apos;s Association, the Amalgamated Managers and Foremen&apos;s Association, and the Scottish Foremen&apos;s Protective Association.Union of Post Office Workers. At a meeting of the executive council of the union, on the 6th June, the proposals of the Postmaster-General for the suspension of the collection* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 14, 2nd October, p. 410.(b 17408T)
Features of the Week-continued.and delivery of letters on Sunday were discussed. It is proposed to abolish such attendances of employees as involve payment of wages at the Sunday rate, and to substitute periods of duty beginning at or about midnight on Sunday, without any compensation. The union have decided to oppose such alterations in conditions of service ; and arrangements are to be made to enable their point of view to be stated in the House of Commons. A deputation is also to visit the Postmaster-General.NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Goal Mines (National). The situation has become more hopeful during the week. The replies of the Mining Association and of the Miners&apos; Federation to the proposals for a settlement submitted to them by the Government on the 28th May were communicated to the Prime Minister on the 3rd June.The coalowners stated in their reply that the proposals had been fully considered by the various districts, and implied that, subject to certain modifications, and to explanation on some points of detail, they would be prepared to accept them. They accepted the principle of arbitration to settle the terms of a permanent agreement, but declared their preference for a National Wages Board as the machinery of arbitration, rather than the other possible alternatives suggested by the Government, namely, an impartial tribunal of three persons, or a single arbitrator. The function of this Board, as the owners conceive it, would he to determine the amount of the standard wage below which there shall be no reduction by the automatic operation of the scheme in each district during the period of the agreement, and to fix the ratio of profits to wages, both at the standard and in respect of the surplus. For the determination of the wages payable in the several districts after the end of the temporary period, in accordance with the principles agreed by the National Wages Board, they suggested the establishment of Conciliation Boards with neutral chair-men. They agreed with the principle of a subsistence wage for low-paid day-wage workers. In regard to the temporary arrangement to cover the period of abnormal depression in the industry, the owners offered a further slight concession on the wages question,-proposing that in calculating wages reductions, the average cost of stores and expenses other than wages should be taken over the first three months of the year, instead of for March only as they had originally proposed.The miners&apos; communication to the Prime Minister stated that the Executive Committee had received replies from all the districts on the Government proposals, that the terms had been fully considered on their merits, and in every instance rejected. The committee were subsequently informed that the Government regretted to learn their decision, and that the offer of  10,000,000 by the Government to the industry would be withdrawn unless a settlement were reached within 14 days, that is, by the 18th June.On the 6th June, the Central Committee of the Mining Association invited the Executive Committee of the Federation to meet them in a joint conference, and endeavour to find a basis for a settlement before the expiry of the period specified by the Government within which the grant would be available. The miners accepted the suggestion, and conferences were held on the 6th, 7th and 8th June to investigate? fully the latest offer of the owners. At the close of the conference on the 7th June, the miners&apos; representatives announced that the executive intended to summon a further National Delegate Conference for Friday, the 10th June, to receive a report from the executive on the proposals of the Government and of the owners. It was also definitely stated that the executive would recommend the Conference to agree to a ballot vote of all members upon the proposals.Cotton Textile Workers (National). The negotiating committee representing employers and operatives* met at Manchester on the 31st May and on the 1st and 3rd June to discuss the wages reductions proposed by the employers, f At the meeting of the 31st May the operatives offered to accept a 25 per cent, reduction, but increased this to 40 per cent, at the next meeting on the 1st June. This was refused by the employers, and the opera-tives therefore suggested that the 40 per cent, reduction be regarded as a provisional settlement until three months after the settlement of&apos; the coal stoppage.  This, however,* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 23, 4th June, p. 465. f See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 21, 21st May, p. 435.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.was also refused by the employers, who proposed an 80 per cent, reduction instead of the 90 per cent, hitherto suggested. At the meeting on the 3rd June, the operatives&apos; repre-sentatives finally offered to recommend the members to agree to a reduction at the rate of 47J per cent, from the standard list prices, representing a reduction of 3s. in the pound on current wages. The employers replied that they regarded this offer as quite inadequate, and that they could not therefore further modify their last proposal for a reduction of 80 per cent, on piece-price list rates and an equivalent reduction on other wages. Both parties placed the results thus reached before their executives, and the operatives made a further offer of a 50 per cent, reduction, and, failing acceptance, asked for a postdating of notices to allow time for taking the opinion of the members on the employers&apos; offer. The employers refused the 50 per cent, suggestion, but intimated that an offer by the operatives to &quot;accept a 70 per cent, reduction would be referred by the negotiating com-mittee to the larger committee. The operatives declared that they were unable to make such an offer, and subsequently negotiations broke down. The employers stated that no useful purpose would be served by further meetings, and therefore refused to postdate the notices. They also declined a proposal of the operatives that the mills should continue working at the old rate of wages, and that the matter in dispute, namely the 80 per cent, reduction, proposed by the employees, and the 50 per cent, proposed by the operatives, be submitted to independent arbitration. Work in the mills therefore ceased on the 4th June.The Minister has now intervened. A deputation of the operatives met him at Montagu House on the 7th June, and the employers on the 8th. As a result of these interviews, the Minister has arranged that the two sides should resume their negotiations, and a further joint meeting will be held in Manchester on the 10th June.Settlements and Agreements.File Cutters (Birmingham). Negotiations have been concluded between the File Manufacturers&apos; Association and the Workers&apos; Union, resulting in an agreement to reduce the rates of wages of file cutters, as from the 14th May, by 1\ per cent, in the case of piece-workers, and 6s. per week in the case of time-workers.Blacksmiths and Farriers (National). At a joint conference between the National Master Farriers&apos; Association and the Amalgamated Society of Farriers, a recommendation to reduce wages by \d. per hour for men earning over Is. 6d. and up to Is. 9d. per hour, and Id. per hour for men earning over Is. 9d. was agreed to.The proposed reduction will be operative from the 1st July. In the case of the north-eastern district, where the wages are lower than in other areas of the north, no immediate reduction will take place. It has been decided to regulate wages in future according to a sliding scale, based on the cost-of-living index number, every rise or fall of seven points being followed by an increase or reduction of \d. per hour.Shipyard Electricians (Aberdeen). The electricians employed in the Aberdeen ship-yards, referred to on page 462 of last week&apos;s issue of this Report, resumed work on the 30th May.Ships&apos; Cooks and Stewards. The strike of ships&apos; cooks and stewards* was cancelled on the 3rd June. The union have instructed all their members to return to work pending negotiations with the shipowners.Furnishing Trade (Liverpool). An agreement has been reached by the Liverpool and Birkenhead District Local Wages and Conditions Council, on which employers and work-people in the furnishing trades have representatives, to reduce rates of wages. Journey-men^ and labourers&apos; wages are to be reduced by 2d. per hour, and labourers&apos; wages are to be further reduced bj* Id. per hour as from the 1st August. The agreement expires on the 1st May, 1922, and is subject to six months&apos; notice. A similar agreement has also been reached in the Liverpool saw-milling industry through the instrumentality of this Council.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Departments section of the Report, pages 482 to 485.]* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 20,14th May, p. 416.
PART IL-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.Engineering Industry. As a result of the discussion which Sir David Shackleton had with representatives of the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations on the 24th May, and with representatives of the unions on the 31st May, further meetings of the parties took place on the 3rd and 4th June, No agreement was reached, and the chairman of the unions&apos; representatives announced that the whole matter would be reported to the Ministry. The Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations have issued a statement intimating that the employers have been compelled, in the interests of the industry, and with a view to reducing unemployment by being able to quote for contracts at a less cost of production, to post notices on the 7th June intimating the reduction in wages.*Electrical Cable Making. The Industrial Council met on the 31st May. The Negotia-tions Committee had recommended unanimously that wages should be reduced in two instalments, on the 25th June and the 23rd July. These recommendations were unani-mously accepted by the Council. Weekly rates of wages for men will be reduced by 4s. on each of these dates ; women&apos;s rates will be reduced by 3s. in June and by sums varying from Gd. to 3s. in July ; boys&apos; rates by 2s. in June and by sums varying from nothing to lid. in July. It was decided, on the question of Joint Industrial Council rates of wages in relation to Fair Wages Clauses in contracts, that a deputation, consisting of the chairman, the vice-chairman, and the secretaries of each side, should meet officers of the Ministry. The Independent Cable Makers&apos; Association having applied for representation on the Council, it was decided to ask the association to become members and to accept a repre-sentation of three, subject to the association being able to supply adequate guarantees that the agreements arrived at by the Council would be enforced upon all their members.TRANSPORT.Wireless Telegraphists on Ships. An application was made to the Industrial Court by the London and District Association of Engineering Employers, representing the Marconi International Marine Communication Co., Ltd., and Messrs. Siemens Bros. &amp; Co., Ltd., for reductions in,the rates of pay of certain classes of employees, members of the Association of Wireless Telegraphists. The rates being paid to wireless telegraphists, under an agreement of 26th August, 1920, varied from  11 per month in the 1st year of service to  25 in the 9th year. Sea-going operator inspectors were being paid  26 per month in the 1st year,  28 per month in the 2nd year and  30 per month in the 3rd year. The Court were of opinion that reductions in the rates of pay of wireless telegraphists were justified. A scale of wages for wireless telegraphists was established varying from  10 per month in the 1st year of service to  23 per month in the 9th year. Rates of pay were established for sea-going operator inspectors of  24 per month in the 1st year of service,  26 per month in the 2nd year,  28 per month in the 3rd year.The Court decided against the claim of the union that men receiving foreign service allowance should he excluded from any award involving a reduction in wages. Their finding, however, was without prejudice to any negotiations between the parties in respect of the allowance.  (Award No. 651.)POTTERY AND RUBBER.Rubber Manufacturing. The question of reviving the Joint Industrial Council is being brought before the General Committee of the India Rubber Manufacturers&apos; Association on the 21st June.See also p. 478 above.
CHEMICALS AND EXPLOSIVES.Paint, Colour and Varnish. The Joint Industrial Council on the 31st May agreed to a reduction in wages of 6s. per week in two steps of 3s. The first reduction is to take place on the first full pay-day in July, and no further reduction is to be permitted until the 30th September. The rates for juniors were also agreed, the reduction.coming into force in equal moieties on the first full pay-days in June and July.Women Workers (Newcastle). An agreement was recently negotiated by an. officer of the department between the National Union of General Workers, Women&apos;s Section, and Messrs. Mawson &amp; Co., Ltd., Newcastle-on-Tyne, manufacturers of sensitised photo-graphic materials. The firm proposed a reduction of wages by 15 per cent, on the current 44-hour week or, alternatively, a reduction by 10 per cent, with an extension of hours to 48. It was agreed that the working week should be extended from 44 to 48 hours without reduction in wages.TEXTILES.Wool (and Allied) Textiles. A further meeting of the Joint Industrial Council was held in Bradford on the 30th May to consider the basis of wages on the expiration of the current agreement in the week ending the 4th June.The employers expressed regret that their original proposals had not been considered, and urged that they should be considered in detail. The operatives&apos; representatives, who had not received negotiating powers, suggested that, as a deadlock was imminent, a Committee of Inquiry should be appointed by the Council, with power to call in a neutral chairman to investigate the position of the industry and the incidence of wages. The employers refused to consider this suggestion in any circumstances, believing that the question could be settled by the Council as in previous years.The Council adjourned until, the 5th June, the operatives stating that there \vas little possibility of agreement unless the employers submitted amended proposals.A conference of the unions is to be held on the 4th June, at which it is understood that they will suggest arbitration. Their representatives, however, will probably receive power to negotiate if the employers submit amended proposals. The employers are under-stood to be discussing proposals for effecting the reduction in two stages, and for meeting the only criticism by the operatives which they regard as valid, by securing that wages shall not be brought below the equivalent of the pre-war standard at any stage.Coir Mat and Matting. A deputation from the Joint Industrial Council was received by Sir Sydney Chapman, K.C.B., at the Board of Trade on the 1st June, in connection with the CounciPs representations that the industry should be included within the provisions of the Safeguarding of Industries Bill, to obviate the serious effects of unrestricted importation from India. They submitted the views of the industry, together with statistics relating to the importation of Indian mats and matting and to the consequent extent of unemployment. Sir Sydney Chapman informed the deputation that it remained to be determined whether the measure would apply within the Empire, and that it was doubtful whether the powers to be taken would apply. The question of bringing Indian goods within the scope of the Merchandise Marks Act would require careful consideration.SPELTER AND LEAD MANUFACTURE.Lead Manufacturing. An official letter has been sent to the secretary of the Lead Manufacturing Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee, granting recognition as a Joint Industrial Council.PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales). The National Council, on the 3rd June, decided to leave to the Provincial Councils, without giving any lead upon the matter, the consideration of reductions in wages as a result of the fall in the cost of living. Representations are to be made to the Ministry of Health urging that a Bill providing a superannuation scheme for all employees of local authorities should be presented to Parliament. The constitution of the Provincial Council for Hertfordshire was approved.The Provincial Council for the West Riding, on the 26th May, adopted the recommenda-tion of a special sub-committee, appointed to consider the question of a reduction in the rate of pay of manual workers, that a reduction be made in the minimum rate of pay for
* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 19, 7th May, p. 402.general workers recommended by the Provincial Council on the 16th December, 1920, and for special classes of workers on the 17th February and the 17th April, 1921. The reduction recommended is Id. per hour, to commence the first full pay week in June, and a further Id. per hour to commence the first pay week in August. The Council also resolved to continue the appointment of the committee, in order to arrive, if possible, at some sliding scale that would automatically operate in accordance with the Labour Gazette cost-of-living index number.Waterworks Undertakings--The District Council for the Midlands area, on the 31st May, agreed that consideration of the rates of wages in relation to the cost of living be deferred until after the meeting of the National Council on the 1st July, when it is anticipated that a&apos; general recommendation relating to wages and the cost of living will be made.Electricity Workers (Felixstowe). The Felixstowe Electricity Supply Co., having withdrawn from the District Joint Industrial Council, announced a 25 per cent, reduction of wages, 12J per cent, to become operative as from the 31 sb May, and a further 12J per cent, as from the 30th June. The members of the Electrical Trades Union employed by the undertaking were withdrawn on the 31st May in consequence of this decision. The Chief Conciliation Officer is endeavouring to arrange negotiations between the parties.GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.Admiralty. The Industrial Council met on the 27th May. The Admiralty, in reply to representations from the trade union side, declined to add any representatives of the trade union side to the committee which has been appointed to investigate the subject of dockyard organisation and procedure. It was explained by the Civil Lord that the size and special functions of chis committee did not permit the additions requested, and this point of view was accepted on the understanding that the proposals of the committee, in so far as the Admiralty might decide to adopt them, should be discussed in their relation to labour by the Council, before being put into operation. A motion put forward from the trade union side, to the effect that the action of any head of a department who refused to grant an interview to a trade union official upon business appertaining to the department was contrary.to the Whitley Reports and to the best interests of the Service, was with-drawn on the understanding that the chairman would inquire personally into any particular instances that might have occurred.Engineering Trade Joint Council. At a meeting of the Engineering Trade Joint Council on the 30th May the general question of reductions in wages was discussed. Reference was made bo the position taken up by the official side of the Shipbuilding Trade Joint Council, and it was pointed out that the proposal that the reduction in wages should operate for all trades in the dockyards would affect certain of the engineering trades. It was agreed eventually that the question should be discussed at a meeting of the Co-ordinating Committee.MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.Needle, Fish-Hook, Fishing Tackle and Allied Trades. The Industrial Council, on the 24th May, agreed that the secretary should communicate with the Midland Railway Company concerning reduced fares for anglers in the Reddibch district.Attention was drawn to the fact that the June meeting would be the annual meeting of the Council, and the secretary was instructed to request the constituent bodies to re-elect and nominate their representatives for the ensuing year.Hospital Workers (London). A sub-committee of six members was appointed by the British Hospitals Association to discuss the proposed schedule of wages and conditions* with a representative of the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union, and a meeting was held at Montagu House on the 3rd June, at which the Assistant Secretary was present.As the discussion between the parties did not appear to be serving any useful purpose, the union representative withdrew temporarily, and the sub-committee then discussed the position with representatives of the department. It was finally agreed that the sub-com-mittee would be prepared to recommend that the minimum rates and conditions fixed by Industrial Court Award No. 371 should apply to all the London hospitals, and not only to the parties to the reference. This award provides a minimum of  3 and 35s. per week for adult male and female workers, respectively.  As the grading scheme drawn up by the

After consideration of the objections lodged against their Notices of Proposal dated the 1st February, and the 24th March, and of the reports from the District Trade Committees, the Board resolved to vary the minimum rates for male apprentices in accordance with the proposals contained in their Notice of the 1st February, and to vary the general minimum piece-rates in accordance with the Proposals of the 24th March. The question of varying general minimum time-rates and overtime rates was deferred.See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 14, 2nd April, p. 319.union seemed to present difficulties, it was agreed that the sub-committee would reconsider the matter and draw up a scheme which, in their opinion, would conform more to the systems at present in operation in the different hospitals, and would then discuss the position with the union. It was also understood that the committee will continue to deal with any labour questions which may arise. - The union representative was informed of these decisions, and the meeting terminated.Basket-Making. A further deputation from the Basket, Skip and Hamper Makers&apos; Federation* were interviewed at headquarters on the 27th May on the subject of wages regulation for the basket-making trade. It was represented that the federation were finding it extremely difficult to collect instances of low wages, owing to the fact that at present very few basket makers were working full time, and many for not more than half-time. It was finally agreed that the federation would take an early opportunity of bringing before the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee specific cases in which agreements as to either wages or other conditions were being disregarded, giving full details.The quarterly meeting of the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee was held on the 31st May. The Committee received the report of the interview of their sub-committee at the Board of Trade on the previous day, respecting the unrestricted importa-tion of foreign basket ware. The secretary was instructed to make application at the earliest possible moment that the case for the industry be placed before the committee appointed to deal with the case of goods imported at abnormally low prices owing to the collapse of the exchange.Other business included the question of the proposed reduction on the &quot; Federation list &quot; prices. It was agreed to accept the proposed reduction of 121 per cent., to become operative from the 30th May. The &quot; Federation list&quot; is the price-list for Government work, and the bonus paid on this list was 85 per cent, above pre-war prices, whereas the bonus paid on the London list was 97J per cent. The recent reduction of 25 per cent, on the London list and the reduction of 12j per cent, referred to above equalise the two lists.Bone Gutters (Sheffield). The Sheffield Master Bone Cutters&apos; Association gave notice to the Workers&apos; Union of their intention to reduce the wages of both time-workers and piece-workers by 15 per cent, from the 27th May. The union intimated that they would oppose the reduction.The employers, through the Chief Conciliation Officer, offered a conference, if the men would work for one week at the reduced rates. The men, however, on the 31st May, resolved to cease work, against the advice of their organiser. A further meeting, on the 2nd June, was addressed by an officer of the department. Work was resumed on the 3rd June, the men accepting the reduction temporarily. A joint conference is to be held, at which the department will be represented.The employers have already notified their customers of a 25 per cent, reduction on the list prices of October, 1919, to take effect from the 1st June.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 478 to 481, 485 to 487 and 491.]

The Board resolved to issue a Notice of Proposal to vary the minimum rates at present in operation for female workers, other than certain special classes.- It was agreed that a communication should be sent to the Ministry protesting in the strongest possible manner against the compilation of a draft re-definition of the trade for which the Board had been established, without prior consultation with the committee on scope appointed for that purpose by the Board; and refusing to send representatives to attend the proposed meeting on the 9th June, in view of the utter inadequacy of the time allowed to members of the Board for consideration of the draft re-definition in question, and of the failure of the Ministry to consult the special Scope Committee.Tin Box Trade Board (Great Britain). A deputation attended at the Ministry of Labour in order to discuss questions relating to the scope of the trade for which the Board is established.Wholesale Mantle and Costume Trade Board (Great Britain).

Employment and Insurance Department-continued.General Situation.-The main features of the unemployment situation which have been reported for many weeks past remain unchanged. The coal dispute continues to have an adverse effect on. any general revival in trade, and the numbers of totally un-employed and under-employed workers are steadily increasing.Men&apos;8 Employment. -Iron and Steel. All the larger firms have now either closed down entirely or have placed their workmen on systematic short-time, and numbers of workpeople continue to be &quot; stood off.&quot; When the position improves, it is believed that most of the workers in this industry will be re-employed practically at once.&apos;Shipbuilding and Allied Trades. A slight improvement is reported in a few instances, but t-he general depression is still very acute. But for the coalminers&apos; and shipyard joiners&apos; dispute, it is reported that one firm in Birkenhead would be in a position to engage at least another 2,000 men. The position in the Mersey district is slightly relieved by the commencement of a three-months&apos; ship-repairing contract. In the Tyne district there is also an improvement; numbers of workmen who were given extended Whitsun holidays have returned to work, though as yet only on short time.In the Wearside area no change or improvement is reported; short-time working is general among firms not entirely closed down. On the Tees, practically all the large firms have entirely ceased working.   In Scotland there is no improvement.Textiles and Clothing.-r ]ie continuation of the coal dispute makes it hopeless to look for any material improvement. Slight improvements, however, have been caused by the installation, by some firms, of oil-driven plant. The lace and hosiery trades are now practically at a standstill. All firms who have not actually closed down have placed their heavily reduced staffs on systematic short time.Reports received from various centres of the boot and shoe trade show that employ-ment remains fairly good, in spite of the severe effects of the coal stoppage. Large numbers of the operatives are on short time, but few are totally unemployed as compared with other industries.Miscellaneous Trades. Severe depression is now evident in almost all industries. The fishing-trade is very seriously affected by the lack of fuel, and a large majority of the workers are unemployed. In Grimsby alone over 80 per cent, of the vessels are laid up, and the remainder are undertaking short voyages only. A good deal of foreign-caught fish, however, is being landed and the position among the shore-gangs has thus been relieved to a certain extent. The majority of fish-curing firms have now definitely suspended their workpeople or have placed them on short time.Trade is now almost entirely stagnant in the pottery centres. In one district alone, Longton, there are 12,000 claimants to benefit. Of this number 85 per cent, are suspended until the coal strike is settled, and of the remainder less than 100 are working on a short-time basis. The position in the chemical and dye-stuffs industries shows no improvement in any respect.It is reported from Bishop Auckland that four collieries in this area will not be re-opened. These pits in normal times employ 3,170 men and boys, and the prospects of re-employment are causing the gravest concern.Women&apos;s Employment.Local Reports. The North-Western Division report that unemployment is appreci-ably greater, a number of cotton mills where short time has been worked hitherto having closed entirely. The Macclesfield silk industry remains depressed owing to the coal dispute, though many of the leading firms are now in receipt of new orders. Eirms engaged upon the manufacture of felt hats in Denton have re-opened during the week, and in many instances are working 4 and 5 days a week. Clerical workers and shop assistants are experiencing difficulty in finding employment, and there is no demand for women workers except as resident domestics. &quot;Holiday resorts are suffering from the effects of the coal dispute.The staple industries in the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division continue severely depressed. The Hull Corporation have installed the necessary apparatus for using oil in the power works, in the hope of relieving the industrial situation. At Nottingham, power is turned off at 4 o&apos;clock in all factories.  Textile centres report all factories closed
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.or working short time. At Bradford, for example, the total number of women unemployed is over 27,000.The South Midlands and Eastern Division report that, apart from, the effects of the coal shortage, there are improved trade prospects in the principal industries. Many firms, however, are nearing the end of their fuel resources. Leicester report that the improve-ment in the boot industry is maintained, and a revival in this trade is expected at Ketfcering when the coal dispute terminates. Colchester report improvement in the clothing trades. Leicester and Coalville report improvements in the hosiery industry. Messrs. Chivers &amp; Sons, Ltd., Histon, jam manufacturers, have asked that 300 women may be sent for inter-view, as the jam making season is likely to begin shortly; this work, however, is not expected t,o be of long duration.In the West Midlands Division severe depression in the metal and pottery industries continues. Messrs. Cadbury Bros., Ltd., are now using oil in several departments of their cocoa and chocolate works, and a number of workers have thus been able to resume employment.The situation in London remains unchanged, and the general industrial depression reported for many weeks past continues.There is no great change in the general position of the South-Western Division, the majority of the clothing industries remaining depressed, although some improvement in the glove trade is reported. There is serious unemployment in Portsmouth, where the live register numbers approximately 1,400. In Wales the tinplate industry remains depressed, and the situation generally is dominated by the coal dispute.The Northern Division report that many miners&apos; wives are claiming unemployment insurance benefit in respect of contributions paid while on munition work during the war. Considerable trade revival appears to be expected in Scotland upon the termination of the dispute, but, at the present time, all industries are adversely affected.Throughout Ireland the universal trade depression is aggravated by political disturb-ance, and by transport difficulties consequent upon the coal strike. In the North of Ireland the number of mills and factories involved makes the depression very evident. There appears to be no prospect of an early revival in the textile trade, and the depression in this industry is reflected in the distributive trades. During the month the live register at the Women&apos;s Exchange in Belfast increased by upwards of 2,000. A slight improvement has taken place in Dublin. The local biscuit factory in now working full time, and the fixing of a later curfew hour is enabling the theatres and cinemas to re-engage a number of workers.DISCHARGED  AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme. Up to and including the 30th May, 25,782 certificates have been issued to employers under the National Scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 283,730 disabled ex-Service men.The Divisional Controller for the London and South-Eastern Division reports that the decision of the Government to restrict contracts to firms whose names appear on the &apos; King&apos;s Roll has had an appreciable effect. Many inquiries have been received, and a number of undertakings have been obtained.JUVENILE BRANCH.Domestic Service Vacancies-The rules laid down by the department as to the placing of juveniles in resident domestic service, which have so far only applied to vacancies in private houses, have now been extended to include placings in apartment houses, boarding houses, hotels and institutions. Most Juvenile Employment Committees have drawn up standard conditions of employment in Connection with vacancies in their localities. While it is recognised that these conditions may not be suitable for application to vacan-cies other than in private houses, it is thought that committees will wish to carry out after-care and supervision in connection with these placings. The attention of com-mittees has been drawn to the desirability of exercising particular care in dealing with vacancies at holiday resorts, where work is usually of a seasonal nature.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on pages 478, 479 and 491.]
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 27th May, the department placed 274 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 55,305. Of these, 7,195 have been placed through the agency of the department^ Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 530 ex-Service men and 34 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 27th May was 11,609 ex-Service men and 1,279 civilians. At the same date 829 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 319 having been registered during the week.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 27 th May, the department received 8 applications for training under this scheme, bringing the total number of applications to 3,290, of which 1,881 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 817 cases. At the same date 204 vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 15 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The department have dealt with a total of 1,218 cases, in 535 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed training in 341 cases, and abandoned training in 45 ; 122 are still in training, and 27 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex*Service Men.Statistics. On the 31st May, 24,039 men were in training, as against 24,349 on the 24th May, and 24,376 on the 3rd May. During the week, 248 men were placed in training. There were 16,698 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 24th May and the 3rd May being 16,426 and 16,491. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st Augusc, 1919, was 32,801,, the totals for the 24th May and the 3rd May being 32,243 and 31,049.Distribution of Trainees. At the end of April, 4,572 men in training under the Ministry scheme were receiving instruction in the building trades, 2,807 in the furniture trade and 2,387 in tailoring; vehicle building, commercial subjects, watch and clock making and repairing, motor driving, mechanical engineering, and the boot and shoe trades, each accounted for more than 1,000 trainees.  Rural handicrafts were being taught to 572 men.Elementary Teachers. The Treasury have sanctioned the proposal for the training of an additional 150 ex-Service men as manual instructors at Sarisbury Court. The arrangements will be pushed on with all speed as soon as definite information is received from the Ministry of Agriculture as to the date on which they will vacate the premises, at present occupied by men in training under their scheme. The Hornsey Training College is to be opened in the middle of the month, and the general lines of the course at the Erith College were agreed upon at a recent staff meeting. The principal of the Westminster Training College speaks in the highest terms of the ex-Service men sent to him for training. The men are well up to the standard of the students who are admitted to the College in the ordinary course. He is taking the keenest interest in the new departure, from which excellent results are expected.Government Instructional Factories. The training centres at Farringdon Road and Northampton Square, in which 74 men are in training in the watch and clock repairing-trade, will be ranked as a Government Instructional Factory as from the 1st April, 1921. It has now been definitely decided to close the Walker Factory, and to transfer the men training therein to Birtley, where there is ample accommodation available.
Appointments and Training-continued.Local Technical Advisory Committees : Building. After some months&apos; delay it has now been possible to secure nominations for the Redhill Committee from the operatives&apos; side. The employers&apos; nominations have already been obtained. Steps are being taken to call an early meeting.No progress has yet been made with regard to nominations for the Yeovil and Bridg-water Committees, as in both cases the operatives&apos; organisations have refused to nominate. It is believed that the refusal is due to the confusion of the training scheme with the larger scheme for augmentation of labour in the building trade by the absorption of fit ex-Service men.  Steps are being taken to remove this misapprehension if it exists.The department have recently received strong. representations from the Romford Local Employment Committee on the advisability of forming a local Technical Advisory Committee at Romford to supervise the classes at Hare Hall Camp. Up to the present this area Has been covered by the Colchester Local Technical Advisory Committee, and several efforts to induce this committee to agree to a limitation of their area have been unsuccessful. A deputation from the National Trade Advisory Committee, who recently visited the Training Centre, are satisfied that the Colchester Committee have not adequately supervised the classes in the past, and it is expected that at the next meeting of the National Trade Advisory Committee the proposal to form a committee at Romford will be approved.Women&apos;s Training.Training of War Widows. During May, training was sanctioned in 28 cases, leaving 219 still to be dealt with.An exhibition of work was held at the War Widows&apos; Dressmaking Centre, Bloomsbury, on the 6th May. Invitations had been issued to members of Local War Pensions Com-mittees in and around London and to others likely to be interested, and the exhibition was well attended. The visitors were asked to note the names and addresses of the widows in their own locality, and to bear them in mind when training is completed. A high standard and variety of workmanship has been attained after barely 4 months&apos; training.A similar exhibition was held at the Becklow Road Centre the following week.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 1st June, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 46,356 apprentices, under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 44,224 apprentices, employed by 17,602 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 25,654.Unemployment. At a recent meeting of chairmen and vice-chairmen of Local Employ-ment Committees and War Pensions Committees in the London and South-Eastern area, attention was directed to the position of apprentices under the Scheme who are at present unemployed on account of the trade depression, and a plea was put forward for the provision of intensive training for a period. They were assured that the matter was receiving the departments attention, and that-efiorts-were being-made to keep these apprentices employed. During the week several complaints have been received from apprentices in the London and South-Eastern area who have been placed on short time owing to the depression of trade. One large firm, Messrs. W. H. Smith &amp; Sons, have been obliged to put all their apprentices on short time.Institutional -Training. A large number of &quot; mated &quot; and &quot; unmated &quot; apprentices in the Yorkshire and East Midlands area are receiving institutional training. An extension of the course of training has been recommended by the principal of the Leeds Technical School- for the majority of these apprentices. It is satisfactory to discover that most of the apprentices on short time or temporarily suspended have saved money against a rainy day.General Training:Apprenticeship : Building. At Melton Mowbray the reports on the national scheme of the various associations in the industry were received at a meeting held on the 18th May, as a result of which a Local Apprenticeship Committee has been established with the principal of the local grammar school as secretary. There was a good attendance of representatives of the industry and of the county and local education authorities at Hincldey on the 30th
Appointments and Training-contmued^May, presided over by the chairman of the Urban District Council. An apprenticeship committee was established, the employers and operatives having. already nominated their representatives. The scheme was explained to a similar joint conference at Stafford on the 11th May; a favourable discussion followed, and it was resolved to refer the matter to the associations on both sides for final decision. After many endeavours, it has been possible to bring employers and operatives at Brighton to adopt a favourable attitude towards the establishment of an apprenticeship committee.The secretary of the West Surrey Building Trades Employers&apos; Association has intimated that the question of setting up a committee for Guildford has been considered, and that it has been decided not to take any action. Leicester employers have also stated that there is apparently no necessity for an apprenticeship committee. On the other hand, the operatives have already appointed their representatives. The apprenticeship question has received great attention in this town, and excellent provision has been made for technical instruction in the various crafts of the industry; but it is thought that a committee composed entirely of those in the industry would be preferred.Pre-Apprenticeship Courses of Training. A two years&apos; course for boys from 13 to 15 years of age, who desire to enter the constructive trades, is provided by the Peterborough Junior Technical School. The instruction may be regarded as a pre-apprenticeship and selective course. The workshop practice in wood work and metal work is not intended to teach a trade, but the aim is rather, by means of carefully graduated exercises, to call out and develop the boy&apos;s executive and constructive faculties.[References to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on page 489.]   -
