^ referred to committee of home affair/^jl DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT.CABINET.TRADE BOARD POLICY - RATES PROPOSED BY GROCERY TRADE BOARD. MEMORANDUM BY MINISTER OF LABOUR.t?RET. I desire to plaoe before my colleagues a difficulty.5078.   which exists in connection with a decision to be given by myself upon an application from the Grocery and Provision Trade Board under the Trade Boards Acts for confirmation of the schedule of rates of wages set out in the Appendix.    I should not trouble the Cabinet with a matter of this kind if it did not raise issues of considerable importance affecting the Trade Board movement as a whole, issues which aro bound to raise some controversy in the House whichever way the decision goes./The history of the case briefly, is that   the Board ?m.\- 6^&apos; * -was set up in August of 1980.     Since that date they hamj-^ been unsuccessfully attempting to establish rates for .t^v;f&apos;?v , trade as a whole.    After prolonged discussion and negotiations the rates wore finally fixed by the Board in March..lastlaifl submitted to me for confirmation.    I should explains that &apos;, the employers who had, at an earlier stage, been prepared to accept the rates with certain modifications in respect of rural areas, unanimously opposed them when it was found that the rates oould no longer be sanctioned in this modified form.    I thought it desirable in view of the very strong protests made against the rates by employers in all quarters of the country, to refer them back to the Board for further consideration, and in referring them baok I pointed out the/strength
strength of the opposition, particularly in the rural areas. The rates have now been reconsidered by the Board and have been returned to rce unchanged - as a result of the ootnbined vote of the workers and of the appointed members, who hold the balance.The difficulties of confirmation and a further reference back are almost equal.    On the one hand, as the Clabinot are aware, there is a very strong attack being made upon Trade Boards as a whole .     The confirmation of these rates would undoubtedly provoke a storm, of opposition.    My experience of the Trade Boards has convinced me of the value of the principle which they embody, - (though I think the machinery of application needs considerable revision) - and I am therefore extremely anxious not to present a powerful argument to opponents of the system aa a whole.    The actual rates in question aro not abnormally high when compared with rates in kindred occupations, but the employers will be able to say with truth that the rates now imposed, at a time when the cost of living is at&apos;119 points and likely to drop, are those originally proposed whan the cost of living was many points higher.    They will say that the effect of these rates- will be to increase unemployment and further to aocentuate the trade depression. They will point out with great force that industrial depression and dislocation - and in the coal areas this&apos; is acutely so - is reflected in the gravely diminished receipts of the smaller Grocery establishments especially.On the other hand, if I refuse to confirm the ratesthe labour party, who have expressed themselves as extremely uneasy with regard to the general Government Trade Board/policy,o-  c .   -
policy, will take this action as a further indication of hostility to the workers&apos; interests; and would undoubtedly claim it as another instance of the alleged &quot;wage conspiracy&quot; between tho Government and employers. Tho workers would undoubtedly urge that the effect of the long delay in fixing tho rate has been all in favour of the employers and against the interests of the work-people.    Thoy will say that when the cost of living was high they did not enjoy tho advantage of the higher rate and thoy are being penalised for delay, largely due to tho employers, by losing the rate when the cost of living has dropped.Moreover, it is a serious step to set aside for a seoond time the considered decision of a fully rapresenta-tive Trade Board taken in accordance with the Trade Boards Acts.    Confirmation will intensify the attack on the Trade Board syBtom aa a whole but a further reference back might lead to a breakup of the Board by the workers.    Any decision therefore; is fraught with difficulty.    All my advisors without exception suggest confirmation of the rates, together with an intimation to the Board that it is desirable that they should immediately reconsider the whole rates in view of the present position.    Frankly, I myself am in some doubt.*I should be glad therefore of the Cabinet1s assietance in coming to a decision, which has now to bo taken as soon as possible.(Sgd.) t.j. ::acna:-ara.Ministry of,Labour.
