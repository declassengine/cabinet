A national majority is likely to take the leaders&apos; advice to resume work, but there is sectional oiv^osition to the terms in Lancashire, Fife and South Wales.The engineers&apos; -tllot yielded a majority of 1&amp;2..518 against the uers&apos; offer, but only about 30^ of the men voted.: negotiations ... re, however, re-opened and a new agreement was ratified this morning.   The ballot paper was drafted with unusual fairness and. moderation.owne weDetails are given of the annual conference of the Labour Party and of the membership and funds of the Party.Most of the British delegates to the Moscow Congresses are now in Russia.   They eroect to receive considerable funds for their return.   It is believed to be for this purpose that Erassin has recently despatched large sums in British and Prench currency to Mo scow.Sinn Fein in England is depressed.   The &quot;rally&quot; in Trafalgar Square last Sunday attracted little notice.The rebels in Ireland continue to burn, destroy and murder, but the rebel commanders find it difficult to keep their men together. The Thompson-machine gun, of i&apos;frich a large number was seised in Ucr York, was used for the first time in the Drumcondra ambush.   A report of&apos; this ambush was found in the possession of de Vale re when he was arrested.ML.-

various outcrop workings during the night of June 20th-21st. In Nottinghamshire, A.V. Williams has been organising a series of demonstrations, and mobs of 2,000 and 3,000 miners have visited collieries in the vicinity of Mansfield. In all cases the police have been able to control the situation but the extent of Williams&apos; activities may be judged from the following extracts:

G. Abbott, Mansfield, June 23rd

"We have had four great demonstrations from 3 to 5 thousand strong, the results all being favourable. We are not half working Vinnie (A.V. Williams), wherever be goes the Mansfield crowd wants to follow."



A.V. Williams, Mansfield, June 23rd.

"Organising a route march to Basford on Monday. Organising a demonstration to workhouse on Saturday.

Organising a demonstration to Chesterfield next week.



A.V. Williams, Mansfield, June 24th

"Let me say that this District will in a very short space of time be the leading district in the M.F.G.B. Talk of route marches, I have led a demonstration every day this week. Tramped over 80 miles just think of it that when you get your 2\\1//2 for Openshaw not a single pit chimney in an area of 20 miles can be seen smoke issuing therefrom.

Since my arrival here, I have addressed 13 meetings and have another weeks work booked up ahead. I have a bodyguard of over 1,000 men to look after me wherever I go."

On June 24th there was a collision between the police and miners who attempted to induce men to stop working at a small pit at Woolley. A baton charge was made and some protest has been made by local miners at the action of the police.

The leaders of the unofficial movement in South Wales, Lancashire and Cheshire, Yorkshire, Durham and Northumberland have attempted to secure the withdrawal of safetymen, but so far their efforts have been unsuccessful.

It is reported from a reli&amp;hltf&apos; Norwegian source that the Third International, which is merely the Instrument and cover ; used&apos; toy the Soviet Government for&apos;propaganda purposes, decided at about the time the signing of the Trade Agreement took place, to follow certain lines in order to promote revolutionary activity in the United Kingdom, These are:&apos; 1,      To cause splits in the Labour Party Movement and unite extreme elements with the British --&apos; 0ommunist Party,2.    . To support Labour troubles by international sympathetic action,3,      To make use of various intellectual, circles in the United Kingdom for instilling new and revolutionary ideas,&apos;-&apos; 4.-     To participate in antirEnglish propaganda outside the United Kingdom,5,      To appear to agree with and help disinterestedly an-&apos;English revolution on English lines,..6,      To abstain from traceable interference and -propaganda.British communists were Instructed at this time to &quot;&quot; -unite every extreme element, step by step, with the Third International and &quot;to work energetically to foster discontent with any local or national dispute which provides an opportunity. - Arthur KcManus has. just circulated his report tobranches with instructions&apos;that it is to be read at branch meetings.   In this-document he admits that &quot;our entire machinery was dislocated&quot; owing to the raid on headquarters and dwells on the difficulty of getting &quot;The Communist&quot; printed.     In regard to the refusal of the &quot;National Labour Press&quot; to finish printing the issue of &quot;May 31st or to print any further copies, IcManus writes,- &quot;I will refrain from observation on this matter until a later1  and /
and more   opportune moment, though it speaks volumes foritselfHe adds that the recent issues of 60,000 copieshave heen sold out.    McManus writes, in connection withthe libel action brought by Mr. J.H, Thomas, M.P.:  .&quot;A statement of claim has been presented to our solicitors by Mr. J.H.-Thomas, in the libel action against A. McManus, P. Meynell and P. Howard-We have indicated our lines of defence and are giving this matter our due attention.&quot;and in regard to.the case of Inkpin:&quot;Every arrangement-has been made to ensure that the interests of both our Comrade and the Party &apos; are well looked after, and the case has been entrusted to the care of capable and efficient Counsel.   The method resorted to by the Police in this case will make an intensely interesting story when the telling is &apos; : permissible.&quot;  -His comments on recent prosecutions are not uninteresting:&quot;The general persecution to which out Party membership has been subjected has, at&amp;st, aroused the attention of other sections of the labour movement, and was responsible for a full dress debate in the House of Commons on the E..P.A.&quot;    It is true that in the type of arguments used on^our behalf one might well wish to be saved from one:s friends, stilL the debate served to expose the hollowness of our Democracy and legality.   We are not blind to the fact that.the interest manifested is calculated more with a view to ensuring their own future safety than it is bom of any desire to be either helpful or- friendly to..... the. Party, yet it is only fair to state that individual members amongst those -who have interested themselves   haya done so quite impersonally and without regard to anything other than the-general repugnance against tho persecutions,     These latte:? were responsible for the bringing into being of a Utc-9 Speech Committee.&apos;    The party has representation on this Committee and has. taken steps to&quot; furnish it with all the necessary information regarding tho pursuance of the vendetta against the ,, Party.     I have no doubt that you have already had contact of some kind with the existence of this Committee.    If you have not and have something of use to. impart send the information on at once to us at headquarters and we will see that it gets attention.&quot;The agitation of the Labour Party against the prosecution of communists is, in the main, anti-Government propaganda, Intended to help Labour, at the polls but most of the steadier trade unionists welcome the arrests and think that if they are continued the communist organisation will soon disappear.   It is said inthe/
m   7   **the Midlands that nine-tenths of the communists are rogues who would not propagate revolutionary doctrines unless they were well paid.The decision of the Labour Party conference not to allow the Communist Party to affiliate   has  proved a severe blow to the communists, who are toning tho full force of their vocabulary against the steadier Labour leaders.      The rank and file of I- -hour, however, approve of&apos;the decision and say that the communists are merely opportunists who are &quot;out&apos;for all they can make without any idea of honest work&quot;.\ Provincial branches appear to be in need of funds and many members are Leaving the Party as they see&apos;no chance of making any profit out of it:   several of the members who are&quot;.conscientious, have been obliged to. absent themselves from meetings as they cannot afford to be continually paying towards Defence and Maintenance. Iftmds-, .  In the Leicester branch there is a good deal of discontent as four of the eight members are stated.to have embezzled the funds, which they collected as the &quot;Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee&quot;.My correspondents report that some of the communist branches in the Hidlands are gaining strength, more &apos; -especially Coventry, Nottingham. Binningham.and Mansfield; new branches are in course of formation&apos; at -Worknop,&quot;&apos; Bloxwich and Bui well.    The Birmingham branch, however,does not appear to realise the expectation of the.....organisers:   at a meeting held in the Bull Ring on June  4th, Harry Webb stated, &quot;I came down,,.from Manchester expecting to find you in.Birmingham well organised, but I am sorry to say that you are like a&apos; lot of putty-headed fools.&quot;    On th e previous ous . d ay the Birmingham cbmmua is tsheld/
held a somewhat acrimonious meeting ?t the Bristol street Schools:   the chairman stated th&apos;t 147 dozen copies of &quot;The Communist&quot; \/ore sold last month;    7 was collected.; and that &quot;branch membership stood at 86, 6 new members having been admitted.    A member enquired how the 85 members were made up as the roll onlv showed 47, to which the chairman replied, with somewhat faulty arithmetic, that 40 were unemployed&apos; and did not pay contributions although making up the strength.    The member who acts as wholesale agent for ,,rThe Communist&quot;, was instructed to refrain from public speaking:   another member who had just come out of prison stated that a communist who was still doing his sentence, had expressd the wish that irif any money were collected on his behalf it should be saved for him and not given to his Wife and&apos; children as he had suffered and. not them.&quot;   Palmer put in a strong plea for his own qualifications for election as an official 3s did four other members, while a sixth said that Brain should not be voted for as &quot;he was in prison. The chairman called his meeting to order reminding them that &quot;rabble must not be allowed to enter the communist meetings.&quot; -. Palmer, and Brain were eventually elected delegates to the Divisional Council.The leading communists in South Wales have -been in close touch with the Left r&apos;ing of the South-W-les Miners&apos; Federation.    The following extracts are taken from an    . .. interesting report sent by the divisional secretary to&apos;headquarters:&apos;.. &quot;Further we are undertaking a very important work and want every support from headquarters in this. This work is that we are meeting&apos;the Left Wing element -on the Executive Committee of the South Wales Miners1 Federation on Thursday and are going to formulate a definite policy to be pursued on the industrial field and- form a communist nuclei on the S.C. of the S..W.M.F. and further that policy on the M.F.G.B.    The following have agreed to attend and are giving us their supportNoah/
Noah Ablett, S.O. Davies, A.J.. Cook, Ted Williams, . J. Thomas, Syd. Jones, Gf. Richards, D. Thomas and several others.    The first five are agents and if our meeting is successful and from the views expressed it will be so, because all agree with the CP, and are prepared to recognise it and join it when minor . difficulties are cleared away, and&apos;all with tho exception of Cook, who is away from home-, have agreed to attend on Thursday, then we are going&apos; to build uj the Left Wing . movement in an unmistakeable fashion in S. Wales-.    We havo undertaken as a Committee to be responsible for the finance of this meeting whioh will cost about  LO in fares, and I think the 35.C will agree that the results will be worth the expenditure.,rI realise that we: are&apos;making a number of calls on headquarters at present, but the time was never more favourable to the CP. in S. Wales and if wo use aur   -opportunities we are going to build up the strongest section in the whole country, so I trust that you will use your influence to secure us the needed finance to carry on.&apos;&quot;Our Committee decided to ask the E.C. to make the &apos; Divisional Council a weekly loan of  10 eo long as the lockout lasts.    The Divisional Council agrees to pledge itself to the repayalof this money whenever our members, resume work.&quot; -The South Wales Divisional Council is. about te institute aSports branch:   it is proposed to establish a Workers1 Sports.Association, which shall operate under the direction of. the&quot;Party.

The secretary writes in this connection: .&apos; &quot;we ask branches to pay attention to this item aa-we hats made the mistake of neglecting the Sports &apos; -field in the past and it is necessary to establish an- organisation that will allow usto influence and.&apos; reach, .the workers on the sports&apos; field-, and- be a counter   &apos;.-organisation to those run by the capitalist class in &apos;  this field.   &apos;,- .&apos;-     - 1 &apos; .&quot;Branohsa aro asked to organise Football teams&apos; . under the auspices of the Workers.

however, probable that the delegates to the Moscow congresses will return at the end of July and will doubtless replenish the British extremists1 exchequer.    It is significant that a sum of  60,000 in English currency and 2,360,000 francs in French currency has boon sent to Moscow by Kra.esIn with a warning that the numbers of the English notes are preserved by - the issuing banks;     Thero is more than one indication that the money i-k intended for distribution among th? persons now attending .tbe, Congress of ohe Third International to be used by them for propaganda in their respect ire countries, but that the. $a-fi ieh. notes will be used in countries other than England, possibly the British- Dependencies.One incident has disturbed the harmony of the present Congress.    Some of the British &quot;Comrades^ have denounced J.T. Murphy, who is now in Moscow, as a paid agent of this office and say- that he has himself confessed that this is the ease.1      The Soviet Authorities have telegraphed their suspicions to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, asking for an early investigation, but this telegram has not reached the newspaper.   The motives of the British &quot;Comrades&quot; in making . this denunciation is probably jealousy, for the Communist Party regards very doubtfully the progress of its rival, the Re:1 Trade Union International.   In point of fact, the .vt&amp; statement is inaccurate:   Murphy has noverbeen paid by this Department, though he was reporting for and being paid by an unofficial employers1 agency during the war- Noah Ablett, who does most of his work behind the scenes, has sent the following letter to the organising, secretary of the British Bureau:&quot;As to your report re taking the&apos;.place of Tom Mann as chairman while ho is in Russia, I will gladly .  do so if I can.

mm   15   ***one of whioh was addressed by George L^lansbury, but little money was collected as the men were obviously the worst type of hooligan &quot;unemployablea     The wlldness of their language at the Labour conference did not help their cause.    The contingents were drawn from various London areas and each was in charge of a &quot;marshal&quot; who was responsible for discipline and tho distribution of rations and was in each case a communist.    Shon passing through towns the marchers sang ordinary popular tunes, reserving revolutionary ditties for the country roads where few people were met.    Bundles of &quot;The Communist&quot; were taken in the baggage cart but the order to sell these en route was hastily countermanded by the &quot;Chief Marshal&quot; lest they should rise to the belief that the marchers were not bpna fide unemployed.. The organ of the unemployed, &quot;Out of Work&quot;, together with &quot;The Communist&quot; *nd&quot;Tha Daily Hor-ld&quot; Wfcre offered for sale by a large number of men in the vicinity of the Domo *nd tho last named at least was disposed of in very considorablo quantities.

Eventually that deputation was allowed to go into &quot;the Court; &quot; at&quot; the end of the-case the Magistrate was followed from the Court House ana subjected,to a hostile demonstration, which culminated in the seizure by the crowd of a railway dray from whioh wild speeches were delivered.On the same day the trial of nine Ear thill miners-charged with mobbing and &apos;rioting w s c  concluded at Glasgow: of these John By em, Hugh Aitken, and Alexander Haclneth were sentenced to 12 months1 imprisonment, Joseph Maclaren, James Peterson and Alexander Kerr to 6 months1 imprisonment, Hugh Stewart was found&quot; &quot;not guilty&quot; and a verdict of ,Jnotproven&quot; was-returned in&apos; the case of Alexander Stewart andpAlexander Boitch.     &apos; :  .

Michael Holmes was found guilty of being in unlawful possession of firearms and John rVrffe and Henry iCcenan of conspiracy:   ..11 three were sentenced to 12 months&apos; imprisonment.    -I similar sentence was jnssed upon Daniel Oallacher for being in possession of firearms and -ammunition without permission.On the same day John Carl Schedel, a German, who described himself as a Norwegian,was sentenced to 1 month!s &apos; hard labour for having been a stowaway in the steamship &quot;River Fraser&quot;, and wa.s recommended for deportation.

BRITAIN   .rj    ri. r-n. tij-ih -t  .nr r m&apos;      wvuj&quot; &quot;J1/-The event of the week has been an attempt on the part of P.J. Kelly, President.of the Irish oalf-Determination League,
to resuscitate tho League in.London, where - it has been badly shaken by the Police raid. -  There was reason to believe that the opportunity would be taken for carrying cut another series of outrages and that gas-works in Lena on were, to be blown up with explosives.    It was thought we 11 to talte notes of the speeches made at a delegates1 meeting which $as to be hold secretly, and on the .85th the Police entered the meeting and shorthand notes were taken.    At the conclusion Mr, ,P.J. Kelly . was detained and kept in custody until Monday morning, while the question of,his internment was being considered.    This prevented him from attending the meeting in Trafalgar&apos; Square. At Sundayls meeting in Trafalgar Square a number,of Sinn ?ein banners were displayed- but the proceedings and the speeches were comparatively tame.      The League held a Ceileah Mor in the Horticultural Hall on June 85th, during which several.&apos; members were interrogated by the police:   about 4OO people were present. , . . ,      -There has not been much Sinn Fein activity in the&apos; provinces during the week but a, few incidents occurred at Motherwell where Orangemen were celebrating the opening of the Northern Parliament:   sticks ,and stones were thrown at them by Sinn Peihersl, :  There is a brisk demand for arms by Glasgow Sinn Seiners- c2LAHDThe rebels continued to destroy country mansions duringthe week as part of their policy to prevent the military fromusins them as block-houses, and for the purpose of intimidatingthe loyal residents in the- Southern aree.They were also very active in raiding, mails and in attacks on individual members of the Crown Forces.   Plying Columns aregradually being brokwn up and in the martial law area there isan improvement in the general situation.     The leaders of theIrish/
r 23 - 876Irish Republican Army, are finding it difficult to bold their followers together, and there is increased uneasiness as to the outcome.   Still with all this murders continue and the people generally are&apos; in fear and&apos; terror.X very dastardly outrage v; e the blowing up of a troop train conveying troope from Belfast to Dublin who had been at the Klng!s visit.     Some soldiers were killed and about 20 injured, while many of the horses which had been badly hurt had to be shot,     &apos;.in attack was made on a train near Drumcondra conveying troops just arrived from Jvngl-nd.   The commander, in reporting this attack, refers to the use of two Thompson sub-machine     ^ guns of which a large number has recently been seized by the ,.lmerican Authorities&apos; in Hew York.    -One of these faile-&apos; to come into aotion and the other checked after four bursts had been fired.   This is the first time th^t the use of these guns by the rebels has come into notice, and it is satisfactory to,note that the damage in this case was not serious. Enquiries are&quot;being pursued but there seems little doubt that only very few of these guns have reached the rebels.The arrest and detention for a few hours of &quot;President&quot;de Valera during the week in a house at Blackrook caused somesensation.    A document found on him was a report from thecommander in the Drumcondra ambush referred to above,    He had also in his. possession the following documents, which appearto have been intended for use in America:(1)    &quot;Ho. 23, June 22, 1921.-      Hinister of Defence;To counter the faction move in America whioh as you note, has been brought to affect, ,  -       even labour, and to make the position of theArmy clear for the Bishops and others, I think that something like the enclosed draft should be signed by you end frtfo general officers, and published in conjunction with the  Cabinet statement.&quot;
