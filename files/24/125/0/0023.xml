I -onlx.venture to ask Ministers to&apos;have in mind that,,if there is a choice between an earlier and a later hour, everyhalf hour makes a difference   to the comfort and well-being ofour admirable clerical staff.     This is especially the caseduring the strike when train services are dislocated, and themissing of one train involves perhaps waiting for hour.i&apos;        I also ask for the co-operation ,of Ministers and Departments&apos; in the following recommendations of the Office Committee&apos;        fa) Material relief would be afforded, if ministers and Departments would adopt; the following procedure :-(i) Save in very urgent cases, e.g. where a paper is required for a meeting on the fol 1&apos;ftwing day, the required numbers of reproduced copies of Papers which it is deSlred to circulate that evening should reach the Cabinet Office as early in the &quot;ay as possible, and in any case before 5.30 p.in. t- it being understood&apos; that papers of this character received after 5.30 p.m.- will not be circulated  -until the following morning.(ii) All Departments should arrange for the reproduction of their own drafts, memoranda, &apos; etc., In order to secure uniformity&quot;, etc, the attached instructionsv \    (See Appendix! should be observed in thepreparation of the copies      The Cabinet.

APPENDIX

SUGGESTIONS TO DEPARTMENTS WITH A VIEW TO FACILITATING

THE WORK OF THE CABINET SECRETARIAT

(1) All Departments should arrange for the reproduction of memoranda, drafts, etc. prepared (for the use of the Cabinet and its Committees. In order to secure uniformity the instructions given below should invariably be  observed in the preparation of the  copies :- The cabinet office will be prepared to assist Departments lacking reproduction facilities,on.the clear understanding that a draft, not exceeding 6 typed-pages in length, can normally only be accepted for reproduction and circulation on the evening of the date of receipt in the Cabinet Office if received by 4 p.m. Drafts exceeding 6 typed pages will need earlier submission.

(2) Save in very urgent cases, e.g. where  a Paper is required for a meeting of the Cabinet or Committee on the following day, the required numbers of reproduced copies of Papers which it is desired to circulate that evening should, reach the Cabinet Office as early in the day as possible, and in any case before 5.30 p.m. it being understood, that Papers of this character received after 5.30 p.m. will not be circulated until the following mornings.

(3) One style of heading should be followed in preparing Memoranda for the Cabinet and Cabinet Committees, whether to be printed or typed. Specimens of the styles at present adopted by the Cabinet Secretariat and a number of Departments, and which it is suggested might be generally used, are given below.

(4) Departments reproducing their own Memoranda should give the Cabinet Office as early notice as possible that a Paper is in course of preparation. In cases of Cabinet and Committee Memoranda, a telephone message should be sent to Mr. Rawlins (Offices of the Cabinet, Victoria 9250 ?Ext. 424) who will then reserve a Cabinet or Committee number for the Paper in question, - as required, which number should then be printed (or typed) on the reproduced copies of the Paper.

(5) Normally 70 copies of all Cabinet Memoranda and 50 copies of Committee Memoranda should be furnished.

(5) In cases under (1) above where the Cabinet Office undertakes the work of reproduction, whenever possible, two copies of the draft, typed ? one side of the page only  should be sent direct  to Mr. Rawlins.
