[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet June 192.1.SECRET. CP. 3091CABINET.INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONVENTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.memorandum  ijv secretary of state for istdtaThe two Memoranda (CP. 3068 and 3068 A.) circulated by the Ministry of Labour raise a question of the highest importance.   The advice of the Lew Officers on the interpretation of Article 405 of the Treaty must be accepted, but if His Majesty&apos;s Government, adopting this interpretation, refuses to lay before Parliament Draft Conventions which they do not propose to ratify, the result will, I fear, be unfortunate.   This would be regarded in many quarters as a repudiation of one of our plenipotentiaries at Paris, for Mr. Barnes, who was a member of the Commission which drew up the Labour Covenant, has explained that this part of the Treaty embodies a British proposal, the clear intention of which was that Draft Conventions should be placed before the National Legislature, and that Mr. Gompers,&apos; Commission understood this to be the meaning of the article.   Looking at the matter from the broadest point of view, apart from all legal technicalities, it seems clear that if an International Labour Conference, at which Govern-ments, employers and workers are represented, adopts by the necessary two-thirds majority a Draft Convention, the whole object of the Covenant would largely be defeated if any Government can deny to the representatives of the people the right to express their opinion whether the Draft Convention should be ratified or not.   The line taken by Great Britain in this matter is no doubt being closely followed in other countries, and if, taking shelter behind this legal opinion, she repudiates the action of her own re pre-sentatives at Paris, the lead given will encourage reactionary Governments. His Majesty&apos;s Government, moreover, run the risk that their action may be-challenged,&quot; for in the event of any number of the organisation failing to take the action required by Article 405, it is, under Article 416, open to any other member to refer the matter to the Permanent Court of Inter-national Justice, and under Article 417 the decision of that Court is final. It would be unfortunate if the action of His Majesty&apos;s Government were even challenged ; an adverse decision would be humiliating.2. Although India desires to ratify the Draft Convention concerning the minimum age of employment of children, with reservations, I am none the less convinced that the proposal to deal with the Hours of Work Con-vention in this manner would be a mistake, as the lead would almost certainly be eagerly followed by other States. If the British Government, in taking action on the decisions of the First International Labour Conference, adopts what would be widely regarded as a reactionary attitude hot only as regards the obligation to place Draft Conventions before Parliament but also in ratifying with reservations, not only would the value of the organisation be seriously impaired, but the prestige of British delegations at future conferences would be weakened. In the latter respect Indian interests are directly involved, for although at these conferences India as a separate member of the League is independent, the representatives of India in endeavouring to secure recognition of special Indian interests frequently rely on the support of the British delegation, and it is of direct interest to India, therefore, that the prestige and authority of Great Britain should not be weakened.E.
