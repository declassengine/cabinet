[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,]5?Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1921.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 3098..THE CABINET.DRAFT CONVENTION FOR THE REGULATION OF THE HOURSOF LABOUR.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I circulate a translation of an extract from a letter from M. Albert Thomas, which I should have wished to produce at the Cabinet yesterday had I been able to be present.W. S. C.Colonial Office, July 1, .1921.THE situation is as follows: 1. The majority of the great industrial States, France, Germany and Italy some more explicitly than others hesitate to engage themselves to ratify the Eight Hours Convention because they are afraid that England will not ratify it. Germany has told us so in official correspondence. I know that it is the feeling in France. The whole body of employers there have taken advantage of the first discussion in the House of Commons to say that &quot; England will not ratify.&quot; Thus it is on ratification by England that all depends.2. It is certain that, even if she did not ratify the Washington Convention, England would be unable to go back upon the collective Conventions or legislative Acts which guarantee the eight-hours day to the body of English workers.Now, if it is true that the eight-hours day, if adopted by only one Power, would certainly constitute an unbearably heavy burden on that Power, it follows that it is plainly in the interests of England that the eight-hours day should be internationalised. The only chance of such internationalisation is that England should ratify, and thus compel the other States to do likewise.I permit myself to insist especially on the case of Germany. Germany is faced with the necessity for a great economic effort. Her present Government has promised to pay the sums due for reparations. It cannot procure these sums except by intensive work.If long days are introduced into Germany on the pretext of reparations, it is probable that they will be retained later on the pretext of the industrial and economic development of the country, and under the influence of imperialistic ideas.It is therefore extremely important that the great effort demanded of Germany should be possible of accomplishment within the framework of universal conventions.1 believe that these arguments have been duly weighed and are at the present moment maintained by important English employers, who feel themselves directly threatened by dangerous foreign competition.3. I believe and you share my belief that an organisation of labour might play a great part in the more solid establishment of peace.Now, here have we been for eighteen months urging on all the Governments the ratification of the Convention adopted first at W ashington and then at Genoa. If this were to be postponed sine die by ftngland, and consequently by the other States, the promises made to the workers at the time of the treaty, and countersigned by the undertaking given by the Governments at the time of the conferences, would be seen to be fallacious. At a moment when the general economy of the world is in its present disturbed condition, such an impression would be disastrous, and would run the risk of throwing the organised workers into despair.Yours faithfully,ALBERT THOMAS.[6520]
