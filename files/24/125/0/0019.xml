(Circulate&quot;1 &quot;by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.)* .I submit for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ende^ the 28th instant.Gggmi mgc oi&quot;&apos; xK3 coitoby.Statistics of Outrages,The number of outrages reported- for the week was considerably lower than that for either of the two previous weeks.    An improvement is shown in the figures of the casualties sustained by the Grown Forces, which show a reduction of 35 as comparer&quot; with the week to the 21st instant, and a reduction of 34 as compared with the week preceding.     there were no Military casualties, and Police casualties, which for the week to&quot;the   14th instant numbered 38 (18 killed and 20, wounded), for the week to the 21st instant 40, (15 killer? and 25 wounded) fell to 23, of which 5 were fatal casualties and 18 cases of wounding.     xhe only engagements of any importance during the week wore an encounter &quot;between a party of police numbering 18, under the command of a District Inspector, an? a party of rebels numbering about 30, at Skirdagh (Newport district, Co. Mayo) on the 23rd instant in which a oonstable was killed an&amp; the District Inspector was wounded, and. an encounter &quot;between a police patrol and a party of about 60 rebels at Kilrooskey,&apos; Co. Eos common, on the 2Qth instant in whioh one constable was killed.     The rebel casualties in these engagements are unknown
&quot;but one vroun*e* prisoner was capture&quot;1 &quot;by the police on tho former occasion, and a quantity of ammunition, together with a cart4no identified as having previously be longer1 to a nnirflorefl policeman on the latter.    She other ambushes during the week were more of the nature of distant sniping operations, and gave rise to no serious fighting.The outstanding event of the week was the burning of the Pvublin Custom House on the 25th instant.     This incredible aot of vandalism, which, at first, was thought to have been the work of ignorant and irresponsible incendiaries is nor/ sflmittod to have been&apos; oarrie.--1 out with tho authority and by the direction of Lail ..ireann, and. certainly the manner in whioh it was committed bears all the evidonce of oareful and deliberate preparation.    About IE.50 p.m. a number of armed men. carrying tins of petrol suddenly entere-7 the Custcm House by the main entrance and, after holding up the constable on duty ana the members of the Staff\ proceeded to destroy the telephones and to take complete possession of the building. In the space of a few minutes the more easily combustible parts were, saturated v/ith paraffin and petrol and set on fire, and having given orders: for tho building to bo evacuated the raiders, who numbere-&apos; about one hundred, then attempted to escape undetected by mingling with tho officials and members of the general ;.ublic.    le&amp;n^hile, however, information of the raid had&apos; reached the authorities.    auxiliaries immediately motoro:? to the scene and in a few minutes the Custom Eouso was surrounded by a cordon of Auxiliary Police. Heavy revolver fire was brought to bear upon them from the windows of the building and several parties of rebels attompted
to ovado the cordon and effect their escape.    After an exchange of fire in which six rebels and two innocent civilians wore killed and four members of the Auxiliaries and. nine civil-ians wore wounded, tho Auxiliaries obtained possession,of tho entrance to the building and took control of its evacuation. All persons leaving wore searched and one hundred and twenty-seven who failed to give a satisfactory account of their prosonco were arrested.     Soveral of the civilians killed in tho exchange of firo have since been identified as activo members of tho I.R.A., but I regret to state that two innocent members of the official staffs of tho Custom  House I-epartmcnts wore among the victims.    All efforts at extinguishing the flames proved to be unavailing and before the end of the day it was seen that the building was irretrieyably destroyed8     xho Dublifl 3?ire Brigado were held up by Sinn Peincrs anr* arrivod too lato to save tho building.    Although a certain amount of temporary inconvenience has been cauaed to the Government by the destruction of current official documents belonging to tho Customs and. Inland Revenue kepartmentr: and to the Lecal Government Board, tho most important loss, apart from that of the building itself, is that of legal Soouments affecting the privato property of members of the general public, and the loss of many records of permanent value to the Irish nation.     It is difficult to see what oomponsating benefit tho authors of this crime imagine that theyhavo gained for the injury thus inflicted upon the general body of the Irish peoplo, and for despoiling the City of [Dublin of a building which was universally regarded as one of the noblest monuments of lato eighteenth century architecture in the world.Eight murders of civilians (including 4 ex-soldiers) attributable to Sinn vein were committed during the week.Among othor outrages were 15 unsuccessful attacks on occupio^ Police Barracks, 71 raids on mails and 3 raids for arms.:
Arrosts for outrages and political offences numbered for the weok.Trials of Civilians by Courts   Martial.Hfty trials of civilians by Courts Martial woreconcludei during the wo ok; resulting in thirty-six con-convictions and 14 acquittals.    5Pho following is an analysis of tho sontonces imposed in tho cases of conviction:14 Sentences of j?enal Servitude    (3 years to 15 years)15       t!       cf Imprisonment with (9 months to 2 years)Hard labour5       rt       of Imprisonment with- (2 months to 2 years)out E&amp;rd. labour   Finos   (of    oachj.fotal   36She sontonccs of imprisonment with hard labour included the case of an Auxiliary Gadot sentenced to 10 months imprison-ment for theft of money from a publican and the case of a constablo of tho Royal Irish Constabulary sentenco^ to 1 years imprisonment for malicious wounding,    Another constable who was convicted of the theft of a pair of boots was scntoncoci to a term of two months imprisonment without hard lab our c Among tho acquittals were the cases of three constables oharged with theft and the caso of a constable charged with the malicious vounding of a civilian who was being carried as a hostage in a Police Aorry.    Tho cvidonco in tho last mentionod caso showofl that tho wounding was accidental.

The number of appeals at present awaiting hearing is 10 STATE OP THE POLICE FORCES.The recruiting figures for the Royal Irish Constabulary are considerably below those of last week but the wastage for the week is also lower and the balance shows a net increase of 24 for the week.    Owing to the exceptionally large number of resignations the strength of the Auxiliary Division is slightly reduced.

Sir James Craig will therefore have a majority of 28 over both sections of the opposition combinedj and in the event of both Nationalists and Sinn Peiners adhering to their expressed determination to abstain from attendance the Unionist members will be in sufficient number to constitute a workable Parliamentary assembly.     The extent of the Unionist victory has come as a surprise to the victors themselves and as a severe shock to the defeated parties which professed themselves sanguine of obtaining at least 18 seats. Allegations of intimidation and impersonation are being freely made in the Nationalist Press to explain the&apos;disappointment, and it is also claimed that the new constituencies created by the Act were deliberately framed with a view to securing the most effective distribution of the Unionist vote.     That a certain amount of intimidation took place is no doubt true, but under present conditions this was unpreventable by any &quot;measure that could have been taken by the Government, and I see no reason to believe that it appreciably affected the results of the elections.    Certainly the effect of actual intimidation in the North has not exceeded that of tho latent intimidation which was the main cause of the whole of the Southern representation outside Dublin University going uncontested to Sein Fein, with the result that even theResignations......Recruits (Ireland)2  net increase or decreasenil

Prom the appended table giving the numbers and percentages of votes polled It will be seen that the nationalist and Sinn Fein candidates polled between them nearly one-third of the first preference votes, a proportion which corresponds- roughly with that of the Catholic population in the six counties.(Intd.)
