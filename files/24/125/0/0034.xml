Referred to aaoCommittee of Home Affairs n w 0(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT) CONFIDENTIAL.CABINET. -        $ $MINISTRY OF MUNITIONS COTTAGES.  &apos; (NOW ADMINISTERED BY H.M. OFFICE OF WORKS.)Memorandum by First Commissioner of-Works.The Office of Works now owns 9,500 cottages, of which 3,600 are permanent, the ohief block being.1,300 oottages of excellent construction at Woolwioh    a very creditable housing scheme carried out by my Departments    There are also 8,900 temporary structures of wood and concrete erected by the Ministry of Munitions during the war.    Difficult financial questions arise, but still more important are the political issues.I am much concerned about the wooden huts, particularly those at Woolwich, 2,700 in number, erected at a cost of  860,000.    Their estimated life is only ten to fifteen years, and, though only put up in 1918-16, they already show signs of wear and tear.    Deterioration will be constant and progressive. After making the ordinary commercial provision for interest on capital sinking fund, insurance, maintenance, and reinstatement of land at the end of our term (we generally hold the land under the Defenoe of the Realm Act and without even a lease), I roughly estimate that the annual loss to the State would average  80,000.But five years hence, these extemporised houses may become a bye-word, and in ten years1 time they will inevitably become slums unless the State is prepared to spend in repairs an amount which will add an overwhelming increase to the high original outlay.    Such expenditure can produce no adequate
return and will bo merely Incurred to avoid a political scandal.As residential amenity decreases, the political burden will grow.    We are already subjected to continuous and concerted pressure to reduce rents.    Trifling increases arouse indignation. A group of huts at Woolwich was seized 12 months ago by IOC) squatters who live in utter squalor and pay no rent.    One may foresee a growth of this kind of difficulty and it is difficult to devise remedies against a vfell-organised rent strike.    I suggest(a) That the Cabinet should lay down that the Office of Works is not a housing authority except in so far as it must provide cottages for its own foremen, park-keepers, and so forth.(b) That this principle should equally apply to our high-class cottages, which however, in course of time, can be realised on advantageous terms.(c) That the temporary war buildings should be treated like war equipment and stores, and be sold or liquidated as quickly as possible)   in other words, that we should cut our loss rather than incur further outlay.(d) Local Authorities will not become purchasers, as their function is to erect and not to acquire houses.     It will there-fore be difficult to sell as houses, but we might be authorised to sell as &quot;scrap&quot; as and when the buildings are vacated.This applies specially to certain hostels,(e) Moreover, as the housing problem becomes easier, a certain percentage of huts should be demolished year by year where per-manent buildings are provided by Local Authorities.(f)   It may even be advisable to hand over huts to the Local Authority freo of payment.     I am not at all sure that In certain cases this would not be the most economical exit from our. liabilities.
I Invite general assent to the foregoing propositions subject to consultation with the Treasury in each case.(Intd)    C &amp; B.H.M, Offloe of works, 11th June, 1921.
