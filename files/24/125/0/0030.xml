[ThisJDocjumenti is one Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government/Printed for the use of the Cabinet.SECRET. C.P-3029.THE ALLIED SANCTIONS OF MARCH 8.&apos;   Memorandum by the Secretary of State- for Foreign Affairs.IT is very important that a definite understanding should be reached with our Allies, and more particularly with the French Government, as soon as possible, as to whether the sanctions imposed on Germany after the London Conference in March last should or should not be cancelled, now that the German Government have accepted the Allied ultimatum. Otherwise, our difficulties with the French will be much increased. The sanctions were (1.) The occupation of Duisburg, Ruhrort and dusseldorf, on the right bank of the Rhine.(2.) A 50 per cent, levy on German exports to Allied countries. (3.) The establishment of special Rhineland customs barriers.Of these sanctions, however, only the first two are now in question, the 50 per cent, levy having been replaced by the German acceptance of a levy of 26 per cent, on all German exports, as fixed by the London Agreement.2. As regards the Rhineland sanctions the position is as follows: On the 9th March the Prime Minister made it perfectly clear at the Supreme .Council that the two Rhineland sanctions were intended to cease if the Germans should yield. The record of the proceedings shows that this was the general understanding.Further, in replying to questions put to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Berlin, just before the German acceptance, His Majesty&apos;s Government stated that, in their opinion, the Rhineland sanctions &quot; ought to be cancelled in the event of Germa&quot;ny accepting the ultimatum.&quot;   We are thus doubly committed.3. When we communicated this view to our Allies, the Belgians and Italians expressed themselves vaguely in reply. The French Government, on the other hand, have spoken with no uncertain voice. A note lias been received from them stating that they object strongly to our having told the Germans our view, and making clear that the French Government are determined ,not to allow the Rhineland sanctions to be cancelled until Germany has given &quot; real proof &quot; of her bona fides in executing the terms embodied in the ultimatum. The note argues that the three sanctions, including the 50 per cent, levy (which is regarded as primarily a British interest), form an indivisible whole.This is, of course, a mere debating point, the 50 per cent, levy having been superseded, so far as joint inter-Allied action is concerned, by the 26 per cent. Clearly, however, it is the policy of the French Government to maintain the two Rhineland sanctions indefinitely ; the customs barriers, because they can, it is hoped, be so manipulated as in time to detach the Rhineland economically from Germany; the right-bank towns, because they are at once pledges, jumping-off places, and valves through&apos; which the output of the Westphalian industrial area can be controlled. All these ideas are inconsistent with British interests and British policy.4. Meanwhile, the longer the customs barriers remain, the greater the dislocation of Anglo-German trade, and the greater the danger of industrial unrest in the Rhineland. This has been strongly urged by the British High Commissioner in the rhineland. : For departmental purposes, also, the position needs to be cleared up. We do not know whether or not we are to proceed with the enrolment, which the War Office have in. hand, of the 150 men required to support the customs posts in the British zone.5. I feel therefore that we shall be justified in adhering to our view, and in endeavouring to secure the support of the Italians and Belgians. In any case, the matter must be brought up at the forthcoming meeting of the Supreme Council, where we must press for a definite settlement of the question, perhaps by fixing a time limit.[6403] i
6. It is, however, desirable that cancellation should be made conditional on Germany formally undertaking to give some sort of amnesty in respect of all acts done under the sanctions. This is necessary, because the legal validity of many of these acts is doubtful, in view of the carefully defined and limited &quot;powers which the Khineland Commission possess under the Rhineland Agreement. The precise form of the German undertaking will require consideration. This point might be referred to the rhineland Commission or to the. Drafting Committee.7. If the Supreme Council is to take up the question of the sanctions it will be necessary to arrange for Belgian representation at the meeting.8. The British representatives will enter it with greater confidence if they have behind them a decision of the Cabinet.   Hence this note.C. of K.
