Discontent amongst;the sailors continues.The Estonian Tsitsikov Company are stated to have contracted to construct 500 barges of 1,000 tons displacement for canal traffic into the interior.   Canal and river transport is inefficient owing to lack of craft, the comparatively small number of vessels in use being in very posr condition and needing repairs.

Greek crews. Such vessels are not allowed to embark cargo or passengers, and may be refused pratique. The Italian High Commissioner at Constantinpole has been informed that H.M. Government cannot...


cannot admit such discrimination against British shipping, and that, as Adalia is under Italian occupation, he is requested to instruct the Italian authorities there to assure to British ships free entry and protection against such incidents as that of s,s.&quot;PALITANA&quot;.Mustapha Saghir, a British Indian, has been tried by a Nationalist tribunal on a charge of espionage.   He was condemned to death, and executed the following day.   This execution, the denial of access to Nationalist ports to British ships, the &quot;PALITANA&quot; incident, the non-execution of the exchange of prisoners agreement, and the increasing violence of the Angora press, all point to the fact that the Angora attitude is completely anti-British, and that the leaders there will stop at nothing.   The attitude to-wards the French is hardly less hostile, though less violent, and it is evident that the policy of conciliating the Nationalists has proved a failure.UNITED STATES.It is probable that U.S.S.&quot;PITTSBURGH&quot; at present flagship of Vice-Admiral ^iblack in European Waters will be relieved by the Battleship &quot;UTAH&quot; in July.

There will be no more formal agreements with the marine unions.PART II   z   GENERAL INTELLIGENCE.MESOPOTAMIA.The two bribes in the Nasiriyah Division which were bombed, have now both come in and surrendered to Cove^nment terms.     Sir Percy Cox observes that there iu no dou.be that a general conflagration would have resulted, had not aerial action been taken, as both tribes were admittedly bent on testing the amount of support which the British were prepared to give the National Administration, and also the extent to which they would be, allowed to take the law into their own hands with impunity.The situation is now easier, though not entirelyrestored.The...
