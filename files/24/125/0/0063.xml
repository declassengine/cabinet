With reference to Cabinet 47 (21) of 2nd June, 1921, conclusion 2, a Conference was held at the War Office on 13th June to discuss the proposals put forward by the Naval Commander-in-Chief, Western Approaches, and the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Ireland, regarding the assistance that can be given to the military forces in Ireland by the Navy.2. The following attended the Conference : Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, Chief of the Imperial General Staff,war Office (Chairnan). Sir John Anderson, Irish Office. Sir Ernley Blackwell, Home Office. Lieut,-Colonel H. E. Brmne, General Staff, War Office. Mr. A. J. Dyke, Board of Customs and Excise. Sir Horace Hamilton, Board of Customs and Excise. Captain John D. Kelly, Director of the Operations Division, Admiralty. General Sir N. macready, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief the Forces in Ireland.Rear-Admiral Hugh Sinclair, Director of Naval Intelligence, Admiralty.3. During a lengthy discussion on the proposals mentioned in paragraph 1 above, the conference came to the following conclusions : (a.) That the search system at present in vogue both in Irish and British ports did not prevent the importation into Ireland of arms and ammunition from abroad.(b.) That the system put into force for a short time last year, whereby such men as could be spared by the Customs from Great Britain, were sent over to Ireland to check the smuggling of arms and ammunition, should not be revived, as it was clear that a civilian staff could not work effectively owing to the terrorism that prevailed in Ireland.(c.) That even if trained searchers of the right type could be procured and sent to Irish ports, there would still be the difficulty of their adequate protection on shore to be overcome, and that even if the ports of entry were strictly limited in number, it was- doubtful if their work could be efficiently carried out under the conditions existing.(d.) That it was doubtful whether our secret service system, both on the Continent and in America, was efficient enough to be able to give the full information regarding cargoes leaving foreign ports that it would be necessary to have.(e.) That our principal trouble as regards the smuggling of arms and ammunition came from America.(/.) That, whatever Naval forces were employed, it would not be possible to guarantee that there would be no gun running.(g.) That any system of wholesale permits to individuals proceeding to and from Ireland would not only cause inconvenience &quot;to loyal citizens, but would be totally ineffective to prevent the free passage of undesirables.4. The Conference, therefore, agreed that, in view of the difficulties stated above, no matter what was done by the Naval forces in co-operation with the military forces in Ireland, such measures would not be effective unless very drastic action was taken towards restricting to very narrow limits, and for a certain definite period, all traffic by sea, both of passenger and of cargo, between both foreign and British ports and all Irish ports.(B21/230)   100  6/21   h&amp;s, Ltd.   9291wo
5. The Conference, therefore, strongly recommended that the following action should be put into force to ensure that, whatever steps are taken by the Naval forces in co-operation with the military forces in Ireland, such combined action should be fully effective. The Conference were strongly of opinion that, unless this is done, any steps taken by the Navy will not be really effective in preventing the traffic of arms and ammunition and of undesirable individuals : First. That the arrival and departure of all foreign ships and of British ships coming from or proceeding to ports abroad in short, of all vessels other than those definitely engaged in coastwise traffic from ports in Great Britain be altogether prohibited in Ireland.Second. That no ship be allowed to discharge cargo in any Irish port unless it has sailed from such ports in Great Britain as may be decided on, and that such ship can produce a certificate that its cargo has been examined before leaving the above ports, or has been loaded at such ports under the direct supervision of Customs and Excise officials.Third. That the passenger traffic between Great Britain and Ireland be severely restricted by the institution of a passport system whereby no one be permitted to leave or proceed to Ireland without the permission of the military authorities in Ireland.The terms &quot; Ireland &quot; and &quot; Irish &quot; above mean the 26 counties comprising Southern Ireland. Similar restrictions will, therefore, have to be applied as regards traffic, passenger and cargo, both by sea and land, between these 2G counties of Southern Ireland and the six counties comprising Northern Ireland.L. W.-E.The War Office,21st June, 1921.
