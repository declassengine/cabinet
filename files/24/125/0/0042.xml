IMPERIAL SHIPPING COMMITTEE,Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.The Imperial Shipping Committee, whose previous report on the limitation of shipowners liability was dealt with in my memorandum of Juno 3rd (Cabinet Paper 3014), is presenting another report dealing with the functions and constitution of tho permanent Committee which it is proposed shall take its place.     There are some points in this report on which the decision of the Cabinet is required.The Committee Is at present a Provisional Committee, appointed in pursuance of the decision of the last Imperial Conference, and containing representatives of the Dominions, of certain Home Departments, and of shipping&apos;and commerce, their main functions being to enquire into complaints as to freights, facilities and conditions, and to survey facilities for maritime transport within the Empire.   The Committee holds regular weekly meetings and has already accomplished a considerable amount of valuable work.One of the duties imposed on the Provisional Committee was to prepare a scheme for a permanent Imperial Shipping Board or Committee, and this forms the subject of the present Report. The Report proposes that the permanent Committee shall be constituted under a Royal Charter with a paid Chairman and Secretariat, and that the terms of reference shall include an express right to exercise conciliation between the interests concerned in Inter-Imperial shipping, a function that has been found by experience to he of considerable value.   It is also proposed to take power to perform such duties as may be given them under legislation.
At present no members -of&quot;the Committee are paid, and the expenses of the Committee for secretarial aaoiataico,. copying, and irrvefitigatioiijSy amounting in all to about  2,500 a year, are borne by the Board of Trade,   The Committee meets in a room at the Board of Trade, and the coat of their accommodation and of such printing as is necessary should not exceed another  500, making a total of some  3,-000 in ali(If the Committee had a whole time secretariat and clerical staff and. a paid Chairman, they should be able to do their work efficiently on about  $..000 a year, and if the Dominions bore half the cost, the amount falling on the Exchequer would be  4,000, or  1,000 more than the present figure.The Dominions and the interests concerned attach importance to a permanent body dealing with these disputed shipping questions.The decision of the Cabinet is needed on the line to be taken at the Imperial Cabinet Meeting.S.
