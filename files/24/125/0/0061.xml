PART L-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The outstanding event of the week has been the decision of the special delegate con -ference of the Miners&apos; Federation on the 10th June, to take a ballot of the men on the question of the acceptance of the terms of settlement offered by the owners and the Govern-ment. In no case have the men been officially recommended to accept these terms, and in at least two cases rejection has been advised ; the general expectation that the ballot will result in a settlement ot the dispute may not, therefore, be realised.Apart from the coal dispute, the industrial situation has improved, and there is every reason to believe that while the employers are anxious to reduce costs of production, and the workpeople to safeguard their standard of living, there is a general desire on both sides to obtain settlements without recourse to drastic action. A settle-ment of the dispute in the cotton textile industry appears to be imminent. The employers in the engineering industry have agreed to suspend, until the end of June, the notices of reduction which were to have come into force on the 16th; and, in the mean-time, a ballot vote of the men will he taken on the question of the acceptance of the employers&apos; proposals. The negotiations in the woollen textile industry ended on the 13th June in a settlement, the employers&apos; proposals for a reduction in wages, after slight modification, being ultimately accepted by the operatives. There are also indica-tions of a renewed desire to settle the long drawn-out dispute of shipyard joiners which, began on the 1st December last. The matter was discussed at a conference held in London on the 10th June between the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades.The agricultural workers are seriously disturbed at the proposed abolition of the Agricultural Wages Boards, which, they fear, will result in a substantial reduction of their wages, and the unions concerned are arranging to call a national conference to consider what means shall be adopted to resist the Governmenfs proposals. Proposed reductions in wages affecting tramwaymen and gas workers are also announced, and meetings of the men concerned have been held during the week to consider them.- In view of possible developments in the future, the decision of a conference of trade union delegates in Manchester, on the 11th June, to form a &quot; Trade Union Guild Council &quot; is of interest.The Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Bill passed its second reading in the House of Commons on the 15th June.The 21st annual conference of the Labour Party will be held at Brighton from the 21st to the 24th June. Particulars of the more important matters to be discussed are given below.The Unemployment Position.Statistics. On the 3rd June, in the United Kingdom, 2.133,085 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Act, and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,571,084 ,were lodged by males and 562,001 by females. At the same date 1,181,034 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on. short time, of which 610,645 were lodged by males and 570,389 by females.These figures show an increase on the previous week of 29,303 workers totally unemployed and a decrease of 7,363 in those working short time.The,total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 10th June was 2,185,700. The above are advanced figures provided by the Employment Department and are subject to revision.A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 505.
features of the week.General Topics.Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Bill, 1921-A Bill for the further amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Act was introduced into the House of Commons by the Minister on the 8th June. The object of the Bill is to vary the rates of contributions and the rates and periods of benefits under the Acts. The Minister, in introducing the Bill, stated that the first amendment of the Act, in March last, was based on the assumption that the rate of unemployment would not exceed an average of 9 J per cent, among insured persons for the period ending July, 1922; and it was calculated that, taking into account, the increased contributions imposed by the Act of March, 1921, as from the 1st July next, and with benefits at the rate of 20s. for men and 15s. for women, boys and girls receiving half-rates on this basis, the Unemployment Fund would have been able to discharge all liabilities and be free of debt in July, 1922. As the present rate of unemployment amongst insured persons is 23 per cent., and as benefit is being paid out at the rate of  2,000,000 per week, with an income from contributions of less than  350,000 per week, the Fund, which in March last amounted to 22f million pounds, now amounts to 8j millions only, and will be practically exhausted by the end of the present month. The Act of March provided for the payment of not more than 16 weeks&apos; benefit in each of two &quot; special periods &quot; ending the 2nd November, 1921, and the 2nd July, 1922, respectively. A con-siderable number of unemployed persons will shortly have exhausted the full 16 weeks&apos; benefit payable in the first special period. In order to meet the financial difficulty and to make benefit available for more than 16 weeks the Bill proposes : (i) to reduce the rate of benefit from 20s. a week to 15s. in the case of men, and from 16s. a week to 12s. in the case of women, with corresponding reductions in the case of juveniles, who are entitled to benefit at half the adult rates ;(ii) to increase the joint contributions of employers and employed from the rates of lid. for men and 9d. for women, as provided by the Act of 1921, to Is. 3d. and Is. Id. respectively, with corre-sponding increases in the case of juveniles;(iii) to increase the &quot; waiting days &quot; from three to six;(iv) to give power to the Minister to provide, in case of necessity, for two periods of benefit of not more than six weeks each, additional to the two benefit periods of 16 weeks each provided, up to the 2nd July, 1922, by the Act of 1921 ;(v) to suspend the provisions of the Act of 1920 with reference to special schemes for particular industries;(vi) to increase the borrowing powers of the Unemployment Insurance Fund from  10,000,000, as at present provided, to  20,000,000.A report with regard to the financial effects of these proposals has been prepared by the Government Actuary and published as a White Paper (Cmd. 1336). During the first part of the period ending July, 1922, it is anticipated that the power of borrowing from the Treasury will have to be exercised up to a maximum of 16 millions. As employment returns to normal the deficiency will be made good; and the Fund should have repaid the whole sum advanced by the Treasury by July, 1923.Relief of Unemployment. A conference of representatives of 16 Metropolitan Borough Councils was held at Bethnal Green on the 13th June to consider the problem of unemploy-ment. A resolution was adopted demanding that, as unemployment was a national prob-lem, the Government should deal with it at the expense of the Imperial Exchequer, and provide useful work or adequate maintenance. It was also agreed that the cost of all local relief works should he borne nationally, and that all grants made by Boards of Guardians for the relief of distress should be refunded from the Imperial Exchequer. It was further decided that arrangements should be made for holding meetings in the boroughs repre-sented, with a view to concerted action, and that the Prime Minister should be requested to receive a deputation in support of the resolutions.Industrial and Other Organisations.National Transport, Workers&apos; Federation.-The annual meeting of the General Council of this Federation opened at Edinburgh on the 9th June. The first subject discussed at the meeting was the Executive Committee&apos;s special report on the recent mining crisis. The report deals with the incidents leading up to the abandonment of the strike threat on(b 17426T) 3 R 2
Features of the Week-continued.the 15th April; it states that it was &quot; discovered that inside the ranks of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain there was a lack of cohesion, and a want of that unanimity which was necessary if the other three sections were not to be jeopardised.&quot; The con-stitution of the Triple Alliance is severely criticised, and it is pointed out that the Alliance never acted as one body, but the three sections met separately &quot; as three different organisa-tions, taking their own decisions, and yet were expected to keep intact to fight the organised power of the Government and the employers.&quot; This report was adopted by the meeting after a long debate, in the course of which it was stated that the main charge was against the unwillingness or total incapacity of the Miners&apos; Federation to appreciate the position of the transport workers and the railwaymen, and that the cause of the debdcle was the impos-sibility of having a joint movement and, at the same time, autonomy for each section. There was a long discussion on the foreign coal embargo policy, and a resolution was adopted condemning unions who failed to carry out the definite instructions of the executive, and instructing the executive to make complete inquiry into the charges of violation of declared Federation policy. A further resolution was passed calling for adequate machinery to give effect to decisions of the Triple Alliance, and providing that, on a decision of any section, the Triple Alliance should immediately become a consultative body with full executive powers.The attempt of the employers to reduce the wages of sea-going workers was also considered. The executive had endorsed the policy of the National Union of Ships&apos; Stewards, Cooks, Butchers and Bakers, in refusing to accept reductions of wages, but certain other unions catering for sea-going workers declared that no assistance could be given to the cooks and stewards. Their members, it was stated, had sailed with &quot; blacklegs,&quot; and, in a few isolated cases, had done the work of the men who had refused service because of the reduc-tion of wages. In their report, the executive state that, despite the many difficulties that had obtained in other industries, there had never been so flagrant a case of difference of policy between two sections of workers in the same industry. The discussion developed into a more or less acrimonious debate between various unions concerned in the dispute. It was agreed to support the stewards in their effort to secure reinstatement for the victimised members, and the Federation were empowered to act accordingly. A resolution was also passed authorising the executive to enter into negotiations with other organisa-tions, for the purpose of enlarging the Federation so as to cover all forms of transport and distribution. A special resolution protesting against the imprisonment and persecution of men and women who took part in working class propaganda was carried unanimously.Mr. Harry Gosling was re-elected president of the Federation, and Mr. Thomas Hoare was elected treasurer. The executive members elected for the dockers and waterside section were Messrs. J. T. Clatworthy, J. Houghton, Ben Tillett, George Parker, John Twomey and Patrick Kean; for the coastal section, Messrs. Havelock Wilson, Joseph Cotter and Edmund Cathery; and for the road transport section, Messrs. Stanley Hirst, Ben Smith and Sam March.- Trade Union Guild Council. At a meeting in Manchester, on the 11th June, of 268 delegates from trade union branches in the Manchester area, and 19 representatives from Trades Councils outside the area, it was decided to set up a Council with the above title, for the purpose of forming guilds in the industries represented. The object of the Council is to secure the complete support of the trade union movement, &quot; financially and in all other respects,&quot; to influence the management and executive committees and the general membership to give open support to the guilds, and to prevent the holding up of materials required by guild undertakings.Labour Party Annual Conference, 1921. The final agenda of the annual conference of the Labour Party has now been issued. The conference is to be held at Brighton from the 21st to the 24th June.The agenda shows that important questions of party organisation will be discussed. In the first place, a series of proposals are to be put forward with regard to the position of women members in the party. The meeting of women delegates, representing women&apos;s sections of Local Labour Parties and national Labour organisations containing women members, which was held as an experiment on the day before the annual conference at Southport in 1919, has now developed into a distinct &quot; National Conference of Labour Women.&quot;* The proposals now put forward are in favour of constituting the women&apos;s conference asa&quot; statutory Labour Party Conference,&quot; excluding from it the national* The National Conference of Labour Women was held in 1921 at Manchester, on the 27th and 28th April. See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 19, 7th May, p. 396.I
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Engineers (National). In consequence of the intervention of the Minister, negotiations between representatives of the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations and the trade unions concerned,f were resumed in London on the 13th, 14th and 15th June.As a result of the negotiations on the 15th, the employers agreed to suspend until the end of June the notices of reductions already posted. Meanwhile, the trade unions are instructing their members to remain at work, and a ballot of the men will be taken on the employers&apos; offer.This amended offer provides that the 12J per cent, and 7j per cent, bonus shall be withdrawn in three equal instalments at the commencement of the first full pays in July, August, and September, 1921, respectively; that three shillings shall be deducted from time-rates and 7j per cent, from piece-work rates at the commencement of the first full pay in October, 1921; and that three shillings shall also be deducted off the war bonus of 26s. 6d. when the Ministry of Labour cost-of-living index number arrives at 115, but not earlier than the commencement of the first full pay in November, 1921.Woollen Textile Trade (Scotland).-The Scottish Woollen Trade Employers&apos; Associa-tion have arranged a conference with the Workers&apos; Union, the National Union of General Workers, and the Scottish Industrial Woollen Workers&apos; Union, to be held on the 15th June, at which it is intended to intimate a reduction in wages, to operate from the beginning of July until the end of December next.Tramwaymen (National). A conference of delegates convened by the United Vehicle Workers, representing tramway employees throughout the country, was held in London on the 13th June, to consider a proposal of the employers to reduce wages by 5s. per week. About 150,000 workers are affected. At the close of the conference no official statement was issued, but it is understood that arrangements have been made for a negotiating committee, representing the workers, to confer with the employers in London on the 16th June, with a view to reaching an agreement.* This body absorbed the British Socialist Party, which was affiliated, and which sent representatives to the last annual conference, t See p. 500 below.Features of the Week-continued.organisations, mainly trade unions containing women members, and entrusting to it the exclusive right of electing the special representatives of women on the National Executive of the party. Proposals on these lines were endorsed by the National Conference of Labour Women, in 1921, in spite of the opposition of Dr. Marion Phillips, who holds the position of chief woman officer of the Labour Party.Parallel with these proposals are others increasing the number of representatives of Local Labour Parties on the National Executive, providing that their election shall be exclusively in the hands of the delegates of Local Labour Parties, and intended to strengthen the financial position of these local constituency organisations, as against the trade unions and other nationally affiliated bodies.It is understood from the Press that a scheme for the establishment of a joint Labour Party and Trades Union Congress organisation, controlling common legal, publicity and intelligence services, will also be submitted to the conference for approval.Among the matters of party policy to be discussed are the decision of the Executive to reject the application of the Communist Party of Great Britain* for affiliation, and the question whether, and in what manner, the Party should continue to be associated with the Second International.Among the general political and industrial matters upon which&apos;resolutions appear are unemployment, Ireland, free trade, the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, and housing. An &quot; omnibus &quot; resolution on agricultural policy is put forward by the National Executive.
Negotiations and Disputes--continued.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Coal Miners (National). As indicated in last week&apos;s issue of this Report, a special delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation was held in London on the 10th June, Mr. Herbert Smith presiding. A number of questions were asked and explanations given, after which it was decided to take a ballot vote of the members on the terms submitted by the coalowners, the ballot to be taken on the 15th June, and returnable to the head-quarters of the Miners&apos; Federation by the morning of the 17th June. A motion to advise members to vote for the rejection of the terms was defeated by an overwhelming majority. It was decided to make no recommendation on the ballot papers, but that delegates should give explanations on their return to their districts.The ballot paper contains the following two questions :    -1. Are you in favour of fighting on for the principles of the National Wages Board and National Pool with loss of Government subsidy of ten million pounds for wages if no settlement by June 18th, 1921 ?2. Are you in favour of accepting the Government and owners&apos; terms as set forth on the back of this ballot paper \The following details were given on the back of the ballot paper : The Government and owners, having definitely rejected the principles of the National Wages Board and the National Pool, now offer the terms fully set out below. You are now asked to say whether you will continue the fight for the National Wages Board and the National Pool, or accept the terms offered by the Government and owners. The Government offer of ten million pounds grant in aid of wages referred to below is to be withdrawn on June 18th unless an agreement is arrived at by that date.Temporary Period.Government offers ten million pounds to prevent jlarge reductions in wages where reductions are necessary. First reduction not to exceed 2s. per shift for all workers of 16 years and upwards, and Is. per shift for all workers below 16 years.  No further reductions until August 1.Further reduction after August 1 to be agreed mutually until Government grant is exhausted. The temporary agreement will come to an end as soon as Government grant is used up.Permanent Scheme.Oivners&apos; Proposals. National Board to fix principles for guidance of districts. Board, to be comprised of equal numbers of representatives of both sides, with independent chairman. The parties have already agreed the principle that profits shall only be fixed percentage of wages paid.The Board to fix the amount of the percentage of profits to wages. The Board to fix the amount of new standard.In this connection the owners have offered as a standard wage the total wages paid in July, 1914, plus district additions to standards, plus the percentage for piece-workers caused by the reduction of hours from eight to seven, and a minimum percentage of 20 per cent, added thereto. This minimum percentage to continue until June, 1922.The Board will also fix the items of cost which must be taken into account by the district auditors when ascertaining the district revenue. Wages during permanent scheme to be based upon the capacity of each district to pay.In the event of a low-paid day-worker receiving a wage which does not provide him with a subsistence wage, the district board will fix a wage which will secure it for that workman. The decisions of the National Board as to the permanent scheme to be binding upon both parties for a period of 12 months, and thereafter subject to three months&apos; notice on either side.In many cases the district executive committees and councils have made no recom-mendations as to voting, leaving the decision to the men themselves, but in one or two instances, notably Lancashire and the Forest of Dean, definite resolutions have been passed against accepting the terms.Cotton Textile Workers (National). The negotiations between representatives of the employers and the operatives were resumed in Manchester on the 10th June.The operatives offered a reduction of 55 per cent., or 3s. Qd. in the pound on current wages, and also suggested arbitration on their offer of a 55 per cent, reduction, and the employers&apos; proposal for 70 per cent, reduction, both on list prices. This was refused by the employers, who proposed a reduction of 70 per cent., or, for those operatives who in May, 1920, only had 55 per cent, advance, a reduction of 55 per cent., provided that the operatives&apos; representatives would agree to place the proposal before the general body of workpeople.In order that the operatives&apos; representatives might have an opportunity of con-suiting their respective amalgamations, the meeting was adjourned until the 14th June.
* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 23, 4th June, p. 467. f See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 23,- 4th June, p. 466.Negotiations and Disputes-continued.Negotiations, which then began, resulted on the 15th in a provisional settlement, by which a reduction of 70 per cent, on standard list prices was agreed to, 60 per cent, of the reduction to come into operation forthwith, and the remaining 10 per cent, at the end of six months. In the case of those operatives who only had 55 per cent, advance in May, 1920, proportionate reductions, amounting to only 55 per cent, in the aggregate, will he made. The agreement is to be in force for six months, and at the expiration of that period either side desiring an alteration shall give three months&apos; notice of the alteration desired.Settlements and Agreements.Builders (Various Districts). At a joint conference between the Manchester Area Federations of Master Plumbers&apos; Associations and the Operative Plumbers&apos; Association, on the 9th June, it was agreed that plumbers&apos; rates should be reduced by 2d. per hour, commencing on the 10th June, and that the question of further revision should be dealt with before the 1st August.At Dover the strike of painters and other building trade operatives * came to an end on the 6th June. During negotiations which took place between the employers and the opera -tives, the operatives&apos; representatives explained the classification of craftsman and labourer in the painting section of the trade. The employers, after considering the explanation, decided to limit the reduction of the rate of wages for painters to 2d. an hour, but insisted that it should be reserved to the individual employer to decide whether a man should he classed as a painter-craftsman or a painter-labourer, and that painter-labourers should receive building trade labourers&apos; rate of Is. Qd. an hour, which is 3d. below the craftsmen&apos;s rate.It is reported that, at Bradford, the 300 plumbers who ceased work on the 18th May * resumed work on the 23rd May.Foundry Workers (Scotland). Negotiations have been concluded between the National Light Castings Ironfounders&apos; Federation and the Central Iron Moulders&apos; Association and kindred organisations, resulting in an agreement for reductions of 3s. per week in the case of time-workers as from the 4th July, and a further 3s. per week as from 1st August, 1921 ; and in the case of piece-workers, a reduction of 1\ per cent, to take effect on each of the above dates.Goldsmiths and Silversmiths (Sheffield). Following on negotiations between employers and operatives, the members of the National Union of Gold, Silver and Allied Trades decided, on the 8th June, by a large majority, to accept a reduction of wages of 12^ per cent, on the existing war bonus of 87^ per cent, and 92-1 Per cen^- on time-workers&apos; and piece-workers&apos; wages, respectively.Furnishing Trade Operatives (Liverpool and Nottingham).-At Liverpool, the uphol-sterers&apos; dispute, which began on the 21st May,j ended on the 6th June. The opera-tives have accepted a reduction, which brings their wages to 2s. 4d. per hour, commencing on pay-day, the 17th or 18th June, together with a further reduction of Id. on pay-day, the 5th or 6th August, and Id. on pay-day, the 9th or 10th September.At Nottingham an agreement has been reached for an immediate reduction of 2d. per hour in the case of male workers. Provision has been made for further adjustments of the wages of both male and female workers, which will be based on the cost-of-living index number.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Departments section of the Report, pages 500 to 503.]
PART II-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.Engineering Industry (National). On the 6th June, the Minister saw representatives of the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations in regard to the proposed reduction in wages. Sir Allan Smith contended that the bonuses which the Federations proposed to withdraw were not given on the ground of increased cost of living. They were willing to discuss a modification of the method of reduction and the period over which it should be extended, but the unions would not discuss the matter.On the 7th June, the federated engineering employers throughout the country posted notices intimating the withdrawal of 3s. per week in the case of time-workers, and 7j per cent, in the case of piece-workers, as from the pay-day in the week beginning the 19th June ; the same amounts, in each case, as from the pay-day in the week beginning the 17th July; and \2\ per cent, on total earnings in the case of time-workers, and 1\ per cent, in the case of workers on systems of payment by results, as from the pay-day in the week beginning the 4th September.On the 7th June, the Minister saw representatives of the unions, who pointed out that, allowing for the fall in the cost of living, the present wages of skilled men were still below the pre-war standard. They contended that the costs of production should be decreased in some other way than, by reducing wages. On the same day the Minister again saw representatives of the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations, who refused to postpone the posting of the notices of reduction, and were emphatic as to the reduction being made in full. They were willing, however, to meet the men again in regard to the method of reduction. On the 8th June, the Minister informed representatives of the unions of the result of his interview with the employers.The union representatives reported the result to a conference of delegates at York on the 9th June, and, on the 11th, it was announced in the Press that it had been decided to recommend the executives of all the unions concerned to issue instructions immediately to their members not to start work on or after the 16th June.On the suggestion of the Minister a joint conference between the employers&apos; federations and the unions was arranged for the 13th June.*Iron and Steel Wire Manufacturing. The Joint Industrial Council met in Manchester on the 7th June, and discussed a special scheme for contracting out of the Unemployment Insurance Act. The chairman stated that the Executive Committee had held two meetings, at the first of which considerable progress had been made. Since then, he alleged, delay on the part of the Ministry had impeded further progress. The impression was evidently prevalent among members of the Council that the Ministry did not wish them to succeed in forming a workable scheme. It was decided that the Executive Committee should endeavour to arrange an interview with the Minister to discuss the scheme. Financial statistics collected from 13 of the most representative firms, and covering considerably more than half the trade, were produced. The chairman stated that this was the first occasion on which such information had been collected by an Industrial Council.On the question of legal enforcement of Joint Industrial Council agreements, it was decided that the time was not yet ripe for legislation, and that further propaganda and experience were necessary.&quot;With regard to a reduction in wages, the employers suggested that, in the case of skilled workers, any reduction agreed upon in the engineering industry as a whole should apply to the wire manufacturing trade. In the case of ancillary workers the general labour unions will report at the next meeting.Optical Instrument Manufacturing. The Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee met in London on the 8th June.  The employers suggested that any reduction in wages* See also p. 497 above.
(b 17426t)See also p. 494 above.agreed upon in the engineering industry should apply in the trade. As this is a new offer, the unions are to consider it, together with a proposal of. an interim reduction on the supposition that the engineering negotiations may be prolonged.FOOD AND DRINK.Scottish Bakers. The Glasgow Master Bakers&apos; Association are still endeavouring to persuade the Glasgow operatives to enter into a local agreement, and have offered a mini-mum wage of 95s. a week, 5s. in excess of that prescribed for Glasgow in the National Working Agreement, the operatives in return being asked to agree to a 3 a.m. start when required, in which case 5s. more shall he paid, and to allow pastry bakers to do night work. The Glasgow branch committee of the union decided on the 7th June to defer consideration of the proposal.At the annual conference of the Scottish Master Bakers&apos; Association held this week, their representatives on the Joint Industrial Council were severely criticised, but a motion for the discontinuance of the Council was defeated by 30 votes to 23.POTTERY AND RUBBER.Rubber Manufacturing. Steps have been taken in the direction of the formation of a joint council for the rubber heel section of the industry. Non-federated firms have been invited to attend the preliminary meetings, and. several are reported to have sent representatives. This proposed council is no way connected with the Joint Industrial Council.TEXTILES.Wool (and Allied) Textiles. Further meetings of the Industrial Council were held in Bradford on the 6th and 7th June to consider the future basis of wages in the industry. The agreement reached in August, 1920, expired on the 4th June.On the 6th June, after a proposal by the operatives that recourse be had to arbitra-tion had been declined by the employers, both sides stated that they possessed negotiating powers. The operatives thereupon suggested that the cost-of-living wage, at present, payable on a basis of 135, should be stabilised at 115, and that no further reduction should take place until the index number had fallen to 95. The employers, not regarding this as a serious contribution to the discussion, submitted amended proposals to reduce the 15 per cent, addition to basic rates by 5 per cent., and to pay cost-of-living wage on the assumption that the cost-of-living index number had fallen to 95, instead of 90, as originally suggested. The operatives challenged the proposed cut in the additions to basic rates, for which they claimed that the employers had not made out a case. A long discussion ensued.The operatives subsequently amended their proposal by suggesting the stabilising of the cost-of-living wage at 105, involving a 10s. cut in the wages of male operatives. After further discussion on the commercial situation, the operatives suggested that the cut should be limited to 10s. a week, and that its incidence should be distributed over the increased basic rates and the cost-of-living wages.On the 7th June the employers stated that the operatives&apos; final proposal involved stabilising the cost-of-living wage at 114, which imposed too heavy a burden on the industry. They submitted amended proposals to reduce the increased basic rate by 5 per cent, and pay the cost-of-living wage at 100. After further counter-proposals, the employers even-tually suggested that the new agreement should operate from the pay-day in the week ending the 9th July, until which date the present agreement should continue. They claimed that wages would not at any stage be reduced below the equivalent of pre-war rates.The operatives made a final offer to stabilise the cost-of-living wage at 105, which the employers were unable to accept. The meeting was ultimately adjourned until the 13th June, in order that the operatives might again consult the conference of unions.*Only 2J per cent, of aggregate wages divides the final offers of the two parties. The employers pointed out at the close of the meeting that they originally had to face a proposal for the removal of the 15 per cent, addition to the basic rate in addition to a cut in the cost-of-living wage, and that their final offer represented the limits of their mandate. Their offer involves a reduction of 13 per cent, on current wages when the cost-of-living index number reaches 120 and 4-3 per cent, when the number reaches 100.
PRINTING AND PAPER.Envelope Making and Manufacturing Stationery Industry. At a meeting of the Interim. Industrial Reconstruction Committee, on the 6th June, the employers proposed a reduction of wages amounting to 10s. a week in the case of men, 7s. per week for London women and 5s. per week for other women. London women are now paid 8s. per week more than the Manchester women, who come next, and the employers do not think such a differen-negotiation can be justified. The workers refused to discuss the offer until a later meeting, which is to take place on or about the 27th June, after a joint conference to discuss wages&apos; in the printing industry.tPUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Local Authorities&apos; Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services (England and Wales). --A Provincial Council for the West Riding of Yorkshire has been formed, and met for the first time on the 12th May.The Provincial Council for the West Midlands Area met-on the 8th June. The prin-cipal business was the consideration of wages adjustments in accordance with the cost of living. The Council agreed to a scheme whereby the minimum, rates of pay for manual workers, embodied in a schedule of minimum rates approved on the 6th October, 1920, should be adjusted in accordance with the Ministry&apos;s cost-of-living index number. The existing schedule was deemed to have been appropriate when the index number stood at 150. Adjustments in-the rates, either up or down, are to be made for each five points variation in the index number. The first adjustment is to be effected on the first pay period following the 15th June, with subsequent adjustments at intervals of three months after the 30th June, 1921. This new agreement is to terminate automatically should the index number fall to 75, the whole matter then to be reviewed by the Provincial Council.GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.Co-ordinating Committee of the Government Trade Joint Councils. The proposal of the official side, on behalf of the Admiralty and War Office, that wages be reduced by the withdrawal of the last 6s. advance on time-rates, and 15 per cent, on piece-work, rates, has been referred to the Industrial Court.War Department. The Industrial Council met on the 2nd June. The shortage of coal at Woolwich Arsenal, and the consequent necessity shortly for closing down each week from Thursday night to Monday morning, was raised by the official side. The view of the trade union side was that no further difficulty would be experienced now that the embargo on the importation of foreign coal had been lifted. Certain of the trade union side, who were in touch with the transport workers, were delegated to be available for consultation by the officials concerned should necessity arise. The Executive Sub-Com-mittee of the Council reported on the question whether certain grades should be represented on the Administrative or the Industrial Council. They made various recommendations which were adopted by the Council, but reported that, in the cases of book-keepers and work-takers, they had been unable to reach agreement. It was suggested that the com-mittee should reconsider these cases. The sub-committee accordingly reconsidered the matter on the 9th June, with the Ministry of Labour representative in the chair. The matter was very fully discussed and deputations representing book-keepers and work-takers presented their respective cases. The committee, however, were still unable to reach agreement, and the matter was finally adjourned for a fortnight, so that further evidence might be produced.MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.Fish Workers (Billingsgate). The Billingsgate Fish Workers&apos; Protection Society requested the departments assistance in obtaining the abolition of a practice in the fish market known as &quot; farming out.&quot; It was alleged that fewer licenses to porters are now issued, and that the licensed porters are farming out the work to unlicensed men. The society complain that many of their members are unemployed in consequence, although licensed porters employed earn more money under the system. A deputation received by the Chief Labour Adviser on the 6th June were informed that the fault lay in the society&apos;s ineffective control over their members, but that the matter would be further investigated. The licenses are issued by a committee of the City Corporation, and are said to be approved by the Board of Trade.
GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS.PROCEEDINGS.Brush and Broom Trade Board (Great Britain). The Textile Machine Brushes Committee, appointed to investigate criticisms made by the Northern Counties Brush Manufacturers&apos; Association in respect of the general minimum piece-rates fixed for drawing textile machine brushes, agreed to the variation of the rates, and made a unanimous recommendation to the Board on the subject.Corset Trade Board. After consideration of a motion by the employers&apos; representatives, the Board resolved to vary the general minimum time-rates and. piece-work basis time-rates for male and female workers; the proposed variation being a reduction of the existing rates.Flax and Hemp Trade Board (Great Britain). The Hose-Pipe Weaving Committee, upon re-consideration of the minimum rates fixed for male hose-pipe weavers, agreed to recommend the Board to fix a piece-work basis time-rate of Is. 4d. per hour, in lieu of(b 17426t) 3 S 2Cricket Ball Manufacturers (Tonbridge). About 230 operatives struck work on the 4th June against the employers&apos; proposal to reduce wages. The present rates are 37J per cent, above those prevailing in April, 1919. The Cricket Ball Manufacturers&apos; Associa-tion proposed to withdraw 22J per cent, as from the 4th June, and the remaining 15 per cent, in September. At a joint meeting, presided over by an officer of the department, it was arranged to appoint a Conciliation Board of five members from each side, with a representative of the department as independent chairman, to deal with the dispute.A non-federated firm, Messrs. Lilly white and Froude, employing about 100 work-people, are not at the moment proposing any reduction in wages. Their employees are therefore still&apos; at work.Gas Mantles.-The Industrial Council met on the 23rd May. Business was confined almost entirely to discussion of the various measures adopted by the Council in the endeavour to secure inclusion of gas mantles in the Safeguarding of Industries Bill. The meeting terminated with a notice from the chairman, given on behalf of the employers, that in view of the continued decrease in the cost of living, the existing wages agreementw ould be discussed at the next meeting, fixed for the 20th June.Needle, Fish-Hook, Fishing Tackle and Allied Trades. The Apprenticeship Sub-Committee met on the 7th June to consider the desirability of an apprenticeship scheme for the industry, and if favourable to draft such a scheme for submission to the full Council. The consensus of opinion proved to be in favour of a definite apprenticeship scheme, and a draft scheme submitted by a representative of the Employment Department, and modelled on the lines of that of the building trade, was discussed.PROFESSIONAL WORKERS.Insurance Committees. The National Joint Council on the 9th June agreed that, although the Ministry of Health were not in a position to give official sanction to the proposed scale of minimum salaries for clerks of insurance committees, the Council should circularise committees, recommending that salaries should be paid in accordance with this scale. The secretary reported that it had been decided at a joint meeting with representa-tives of the insurance profession that staffs of insurance committees should he excluded from the special unemployment insurance scheme for the profession; it was decided, therefore, to open negotiations with a view to finding out whether such staffs could be regarded as employees of local authorities in order to secure&apos; exclusion from the Acts, and the liaison officer was requested to ascertain the views of the Ministry on this possibility.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 494 to 499, 503, 504 and 508.]

The Board agreed to fix minimum rates of wages in accordance with the proposals set out in their Notice dated the 31st March, 1921,* and suggested the 4th July as the. date from which the minimum rates should become effective.shirt making Trade Board (Great Britain). A motion was put forward on behalf of the employers&apos; representatives, to vary the minimum rates at present in operation, and to fix minimum rates for workers within the scope of the trade as re-defined in the amended regulations of the Board, to whom the present minimum rates do not apply. The Board agreed to defer further consideration of this motion.The Board considered certain questions of scope, and agreed to direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that, in the definition of the trade specified in the Trade Boards (shirt making) Order, 1920, porters are not specifically included within the scope of the Board, and to inquire whether porters are to be regarded as coming within the scope of the new definition of the trade.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Brush and Broom Trade Board (Great Bntairi).-The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 10th June, to vary the general minimum time-rates, piece-work basis time-rates and overtime races for certain classes of female workers, and to fix general minimum piece-rates and overtime rates for certain classes of male and female workers.The general minimum time-rates proposed for female pan hands, of all ages,- range from S^d. to Is. h\d. per hour, according to the operations upon which they are employed; lower rates are proposed for female pan-setting learners. For female pan hands, employed on certain specified operations, the proposed piece-work basis time-rate is Is. 1\d. per hour.Coffin Furniture and Cerement Making Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 10th June, to vary the general minimum time-rates, piece-work basis time-rates and overtime rates for male workers in the coffin furniture section, and to fix general minimum time-rates and overtime rates for male workers, under 18 years of age, employed on packing, rough warehousing and dispatching, etc.The general minimum time-rates per week of 47 hours proposed for workers, 21 years of age or over, range, according to experience, from 74s. Qd. to 88s. for dressers and stampers, and from 76s. to 90s. for polishers and planishers, including wheelers, the rates for younger workers ranging from 51s. 6d. to 14s., according to age and experience. For male workers, 21 years of age, employed on packing, rough warehousing and dispatching, &amp;c, the rates range, according to experience, from 56s. 6d. to 66s. ; and for younger workers, from 14s. to 43s., according to age and experience. The piecework basis time-rates proposed are 12^ per cent, above the appropriate general minimum time-rates.Toy Trade Board (Great Britain). The Minister has made an Order dated the 4th June, confirming the general minimum time-rates and overtime rates fixed, for male and female workers, and has specified the 13th June as the date from which these rates are effective.

The opinion is expressed, however, that a settlement of the coal dispute would react favourably on the cotton trade negotiations. - &apos;&apos;The principal changes reported during the week are noted below.Men&apos;s Employment.Iron and Steel. In Scotland a nut and bolt factory at Airdrie, employing 250 men, has re-opened on securing a large supply of coal from an out-crop. - At Coatbridge two ironfounding establishments have suspended operations indefinitely, and at Wishaw further suspensions from the principal steel works are expected during the week. On the Tees unemployment has slightly increased, but, as nearly all the large firms are now closed, it is thought that further increases,are unlikely.A few men have been able to resume employment at Sheffield as a result of the arrival of small supplies of coal, and also of a greater output of electrical current from the power station. On the other hand, at Chesterfield, Messrs. Markham &amp; Co., Ltd., engineers,, who employ about 800 men and boys, closed the whole of their works on the 4th June. At Leeds there is a decrease in the live register of 1,843, principally accounted for by increased activity at the foundry of Messrs. Fairbairn, Lawson, Combe, Barbour, Ltd., and at the engineering works of Messrs. J. Fowler &amp; Co., Ltd. The position at Newark is also easier as the result of the re-opening of the foundries of Messrs. Ransome &amp; Co., Ltd., and Messrs. Ruston &amp; Hornsby, Ltd.In the North-Western Division the general engineering trade is seriously depressed and most districts now report extensive unemployment. Several large firms in the Trafibrd Park district however, are adopting oil fuel, and Metropolitan-Vickers, Ltd., have resumed full-time working by means of oil power. The textile branch of the trade is understood to have numerous orders on hand, but is held up by the.coal shortage.In the West Midlands Division, Messrs. Wi &amp; T. Avery, Ltd., Soho Foundry, Smeth-wick, who up to the present have been working practically full time, have notified their intention of placing some 1,500 workpeople on a short-time system of three days per week..Shipbuilding and Allied Industries. On the Clyde, unemployment is increasing, mainly as a result of the joiners&apos; strike ; a settlement of the dispute would result in a large number&apos; of other tradesmen at present unemployed being absorbed. On the Tyne, Tees and Wear,, suspensions are still taking place in small numbers, and it is anticipated that firms will take.(b 17426T) 3 S 3
18.6,21.Employment and Insurance Department-continued.advantage of the Newcastle race week to close for an extended holiday period. On the Mersey the position is easier, and the demand for ship-repair workers has increased. The only change reported from South Wales J.s at Newport, where repair work has improved slightly.Textiles and Clothing. The position in the cotton trade is overshadowed by the hitch in the negotiations on the wages question. In the woollen textile trade most factories are now feeling the shortage of coal acutely. A slight improvement, however, is reported from Sowerby Bridge, where three small firms have recommenced work on a short-time system. In the jute trade two firms at Dundee, employing approximately 2,000 workers, have closed for an indefinite period owing to lack of coal. Production in the hosiery trade continues to be fairly good, despite fuel and power restrictions, and the opinion is held that trade will improve steadily when the coal dispute is settled. At Northampton the boot and shos trade has been dislocated owing to restrictions in the supply of gas during working hours. Employment in the boot factories at Stafford continues to be good, and very few operatives are at present on short time.Transport. At Leith the arrival of several large coal, grain and general cargo ships is expected during the week. A number of timber boats have arrived at Grimsby and Immingham, and more dock labourers have been employed. The position at Avonmouth has also improved, consequent on the arrival of several cargoes of grain from Canada. The Shropshire Union Canal Company have announced that they are ceasing business as carriers on the 31st August, and, unless the concern is taken over by another company, several hundred workmen will be thrown out of employment.Miscellaneous Trades. In the Metropolitan area unemployment is steadily increasing in most factory districts. More activity, however, is reported in the house decorating trade, though the jobs are mostly of short duration. The difficulty of securing plasterers and bricklayers is still pronounced.In the fishing industry a few trawlers put to sea during the week from Eleetwood, with bunkers of imported coal, but the majority were compelled to return to port owing to their inability to raise the necessary head of steam. Owing to the limited supplies of coal and ice very few. boats are putting out from Grimsby. Pishing at Wick is entirely suspended, and fish-curers are discharging staffs.Women&apos;s Employment.Local Reports. The North-Western Division state that, were not the whole division overshadowed by the dispute in the cotton trade in addition to the coal strike, the unem-ployment situation would be decidedly brighter. As a result of the deadlock many mills have already closed down, but it is expected that when trade revives it will be maintained for a considerable period in view of the exhaustion of stock. The industrial stagnation is said to be having a marked effect upon even the notification of vacancies for domestic workers. At Manchester, where the demand for domestics is usually in excess of the supply, at the present time it is not possible to submit all suitable applicants on account of the scarcity of orders. The wages now offered are said to be very low, and the situation in regard to this occupation is unprecedented.Rapidly increasing depression is reported from all the large textile centres in the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division. Depression continues in other industries such as hosiery, lace, clothing, paper, glass and leather. At Nottingham trade prospects are somewhat better, and some orders are being lodged by American buyers.The South Midlands and Eastern Division report serious unemployment at Bedford, Northampton, Norwich and Leicester, where the boot and hosiery industries remain depressed. At the Leicester Exchange approximately 900 cases have been suspended from benefit, and rotas of the Women&apos;s Sub-Committee are being formed to deal rapidly with the work.Wisbech report that the fruit-picking season will begin shortly, and, it is hoped, will absorb a considerable amount of labour. The railway companies are running special trains for fruit-pickers from London.In London the general industrial situation remains seriously depressed. The paper, printing, engineering, dressmaking, needlework, boot and laundry trades are specially affected.  Seasonal work in the seaside resorts is not as brisk as in normal years.The South-Western Division report little change in the general industrial position, the staple clothing trades of shirt and collar-making, tailoring, corset manufacture and glove-making remaining depressed.
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Employment. Upon hearing of a proposal to restrict the supply of electrical power to three days a week, the secretary of the Leeds Employment Committee communicated with the electricity department of a Leeds Corporation, calling attention to the fact that such action would swell the already heavy live register, and throw many more on the Unemployment Fund under the systematic short-time arrangements in force. It was pointed out that if the supply could be maintained for four or more days a week a great saving in unemployment payments would result. These representations were supported by a deputation of employers in the clothing industry, and as a result, the Corporation have made arrangements to supply electricity on four days a week.iDISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme.-lJj) to and including the 7th June, 26,039 certificates have been issued to employers under the scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 286,044 disabled ex-Service men.The Divisional Controller for the South Midlands and Eastern Division reports that 179 disabled men have been placed during the last month. The live register, however, has increased from 3,241 to 3,379, but the Controller is sanguine that as soon as the coal trade dispute is terminated, it will be possible to effect a considerable increase in the number of placings.JUVENILE BRANCH.Domestic Service. Treasury sanction was obtained in March, 1921, for the Ministry of Labour to contribute to a scheme for training unemployed women in home crafts and allied subjects, to be carried out by the Central Committee on Women&apos;s Training and Employment, in the proportion of  l to every  2 spent by the committee up to a maximum contribution of  50,000. The Central Committee offered to allocate  100,000 for this purpose from, the funds at their disposal. It is proposed in all to train between 6,000 and 7,000 women. The courses are set up in co-operation with the local education and mani-cipal authorities, and trainees have hitherto been. selected by the Local Employment Committees from volunteers from among suitable unemployed women between the ages of 18 and 35 on the Exchange registers. A maintenance grant of  1 is paid during training ; the duration of the course is about 13 weeks.Arrangements are now being made to include juveniles of 16 years and upwards in the scheme. Wherever practicable, separate courses for girls between 16 and 18 will be arranged. Courses have already been opened in Canning Town, Westminster, Camberwell, Bermondsey, Whitechapel and Woolwich ; in Bristol, Sheffield and Reading; and in Edinburgh, Hamilton, Aberdeen, Kirkcaldy, Dundee, Dunfermline and Leith. The classes provide accommodation for over a thousand trainees.At High Wycombe, the Juvenile Employment Committee placed a good percentage of the Easter school-leavers in resident domestic service. It is stated that here the operation of the Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment) Act tends to direct young girls to domestic service.Centres for Unemployed Juveniles. In the week ending the 1st June, the number of centres open for unemployed juveniles in England and Wales was 10, and the number of boys and girls in attendance 1,150.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on pages 494, 495, 503, 508 and 509.]APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND  CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 3rd June the department placed 277 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 55,582. Of these 7,213 have been placed through the agency of the departments Interviewing Boards.   Applications were registered from 518 ex-Service men and 34

At the same date, 816 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 294 having been registered during the week.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme. Up to the 3rd June, after allowing for cancellations and withdrawals, the department have received 28,196 applications for training of the type provided by the department and 49,409 for training of the type provided by other Government departments. The Interviewing Boards have dealt with 27,926 applications, of which 23,404 have been recommended. The Grants Committee, dealing with applications so recommended, have received 22,278 applications and sanctioned grants in 18,458 cases.Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 3rd June, the department received 5 applications for training under this scheme, bringing the total number of applications to 3,294 of which 1,909 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 824 cases. At the same date 205 vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 11 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers Under Pensions Warrant. The department have dealt with a total of 1,229 cases, in 546 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed training in 346 cases, and abandoned training in 45 ; 125 are still in training, and 30 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics-On the 7th June, 23,840 men were in training, as against 24,039 on the 31st May, and 24,326 on the 10th May. During the week 268 men were placed in training. There were 16,755 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 31st May and the 10th May being 16,698 and 16,455. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 33,268, the totals for the 31st May and the 10th May being 32,801 and 31,491.Hostels and Canteens. An order has been issued for the closing of the Harry Preston Hostel, Brighton. It has been decided that the Springfield College and Hillcrest Hostels, at Birmingham, should be run under joint management.Government Instructional Factories. The transfer of the existing courses and equipment from Vanbrugh Hall, Blackheath, to the Hackney Marshes Factory has been sanctioned, and steps are being taken to start on the work of removal.Industrial training at the Hornsey Factory ceased on the 31st May, and the factory will be opened as a training college for manual instructors by the end of June.Arrangements are in hand for closing the City Hall Factory, Manchester, which will be finally relinquished as from the 31st August. The men in training will be transferred to Ayres Road, Pendleton, and Derby Street, Manchester.National Trade Advisory Committees : Boot and Shoe. At a meeting on the 1st June the committee considered a scheme for the establishment of co-partnership workshops, for the absorption of a certain number of the men at present in training. It was decided that particulars of the scheme should be submitted to all Local Technical Advisory Committees for their observations. The committee also expressed their willingness to consider further applications for training, in exceptional cases where there is an assured prospect of employment or occupation in a rural area, and where the applicant is unable, through his disability, to be trained for any Other employment.National Trade Advisory Committees: Cane and Willow Industry. On the 31st May a resolution was considered from the South Wales District Sub-Committee, that the resolution, passed at the previous meeting of the National Committee, that disabled men-must count as apprentices, and must in no.circumstances lose their continuity of training-owing to a shop being on short time, be rescinded. It was unanimously decided that the resolution passed at Bristol be affirmed, and that the attention of Divisional Directors of Training be called to the regulations of the trade.
Appointments and Training -continued.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 1st June, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 46,434 apprentices, under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 44,297 apprentices, employed by 17,608 employers. The. total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 26,031.Applications. Applications on behalf of 57 ex-Service apprentices employed by the North British Railway Company have been received. This number is considerably less than was anticipated, but, apparently, Glasgow and Edinburgh alone have as yet been dealt with. The company have workshops in Stirling, Dundee, Perth and elsewhere, and youths probably enlisted from these centres also.Progress. At the invitation of the apprentice supervisor of the British Thomson-Houston Co., Ltd., Rugby, the Chief Local Officer for the West Midlands area paid a visit to the works in order to see the methods in operation for training apprentices under the Scheme. It was suggested that periodical visits every four months might with advantage be made, as the firm were convinced that such visits were helpful from the point of view of discipline, and as a means of encouragement to the apprentices.General Training.Apprenticeship: Building. A Local Apprenticeship Committee had now been estab-lished at Northampton ; the first meeting will be held shortly, and an officer of the depart-ment has been invited to attend. Thus the lead has been given to Wellingborough, Kettering and Rushden, who hesitated to take the initiative. The secretaries of the master builders&apos; associations in Wellingborough and Kettering are calling a special meeting of members to consider the steps to be taken. In the former town, the employers&apos; secretary has stated that there is no strong desire on the part of the employers to join hands with the operatives, as the chairman of the operatives is spoken of as an extremist. A joint conference of employers and operatives at West Bromwich decided in February to set up an apprenticeship committee ; definite steps are now to be taken to put the scheme into operation. Following a similar conference which was held at Coventry on the 2nd March, the first meeting of the local committee was held on the 2nd June. At Redditch, however, the employers have appointed their representatives for an apprenticeship committee, but the operatives have not. The employers&apos; secretary will approach the operatives with a view to the nomination of their representatives.A joint conference at Sutton Coldfield, on the 19th May, was attended by influential members on both sides, who showed great interest in the national scheme. The meeting decided to commend the scheme to the constituent organisations for adoption, and. it was agreed to select a small committee which would form the nucleus of an apprenticeship committee.[References to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on pages 503 and 507.]
