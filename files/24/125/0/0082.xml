PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.the general situation.General Survey of the Week.Contrary to the general expectation, the ballot of the miners on the question of the acceptance of the terms of settlement proposed by the Government and the mineowners resulted in the rejection of those terms by 435,614 votes to 180,724.*The miners&apos; executive met on the 17th and 18th June, and decided that the stoppage must continue. They also decided that the various executive committees of the national unions affected by wages disputes should be asked to meet them &quot; with the object of taking national action with the miners to secure our mutual demands.&quot; Negotiations involving reductions of wages are at present proceeding, among other trades, with the engineering, cotton textile, transport and agricultural workers, and representatives of the unions concerned are reported to have been invited, in accordance with the decision of the miners&apos; executive, to meet that body at an early date. This question of further support for the miners was also referred to by Mr. F. Hodges in a speech at the annual conference of the National Labour Party at Brighton on the 21st June, when he stated that the miners believed that they &quot; were helping the industrial workers generally in what would eventually be their subsequent battle,&quot; and that they would welcome any help that &quot; comes spon-taneously from the hearts of men and women.&quot; At the same time he intimated that the miners were near the end of their powers of endurance, and, failing some such help, might have to &quot; bend and bow &quot; to the forces against them.The general industrial situation has not changed since last week. The dispute in the cotton textile industry continues, but a settlement appears to be imminent. The Joint Negotiating Committee met on the 17th June to receive reports from their members on the recommended terms of settlement,! but adjourned until the 24th, when it is expected that the employers&apos; proposals will be accepted. The proposal of port employers, referred to below, to reduce the national minimum wage of dock labourers from 16s. per day, the amount fixed as the result of Lord Shaw&apos;s Court of Inquiry, to 12s. per day, is also of some interest.The Labour Gazette cost-of-living index number for June is 119, as compared with 128 for May.The Unemployment Position.Statistics-Ov. the 10th June, in the United Kingdom 2,153,018 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Act, and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,593,066 were lodged by males and 559,952 by females. At the same date$866,798 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 514,953 were lodged by males and 351,845 by females.These figures show an increase on the previous week of 19,933 workers totally unem-ployed and a decrease of 314,236 in those working short time.JThe total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 17th June was 2,180,000. The above are advanced figures provided by the Employment Department and are subject to revision.A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 523.* In view of the widespread comment on the smallness of this vote, it may be noted that the total of votes cast, 616,338, is only 58,211 less than the ballot vote of November last which resulted in the termina-tion of the October strike. In the ballot of August, on the general question of a strike, and of October, on the datum line proposals, the total number of votes cast was 845,647 and 816,526, respectively.t See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 25, 18th June, p. 499.j The reduced number of books and policies lodged by short-time workers is largely due to the dispute in tho cotton trade.
FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Agriculture Act, 1920.-It will be remembered that on the 8th June the Minister for Agriculture announced in the House of Commons the intention of the Government to put an end to the State control of agriculture, and to introduce a Bill for this purpose during the present session. The unions catering for agricultural labourers are taking up the matter as regards Agricultural Wages Boards. * A delegate conference of the Agricultural Section of the Workers&apos; Union was held in London on the 14th June, and a resolution was passed condemning the decision as a breach of faith on the part of the Government, and declaring their determination to fight for the retention of the Wages Board. A similar resolution has been passed by the National Union of Agricultural Workers, and arrangements have been made to hold meetings of protest in the various districts. Many local branches of the unions have also recorded their protests against the decision.The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress met on the 15th June to discuss the situation, and decided to seek an interview with the Prime Minister at the earliest possible moment. At a meeting of the National Executive of the Labour Party, at Brighton on the 18th June, the question was considered; and two members of the executive were appointed to confer with the representatives of the National Union of Agricultural Workers and the Workers&apos; Union as to the policy to be pursued.Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. The committee appointed by the Agricultural Wages Board in December, 1920, to inquire into the extent to which the Unemployment Insurance Act might be made applicable and beneficial to agricultural workers, have now issued a report (Cmd. 1344).The conclusions of the committee are: (1) That there is general opposition both by employers and workers to the inclusion of agri-culture under the general provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920 ;(2) That there is no evidence that a special scheme for agriculture under the Act would, or would not, be acceptable to employers or workers, and that, in any case, the information at present available as to the incidence of unemployment in agriculture is insufficient for the preparation of such a scheme;(3) That there is no evidence of such general agreement as would be necessary for the considera-tion of a voluntary scheme of insurance against unemployment, outside the Act, and independent of State aid.On the point of the extent of unemployment in the industry, the committee refer to information supplied by District Wages Committees, and state that it is their opinion that there is little or no unemployment among skilled workers, that where it exists it is among the unskilled or inefficient workmen, and that this opinion is in agreement with reports received from the National Farmers&apos; Union and the National Union of Agricultural Workers.Proposed &quot; Whitley Councils &quot;for Railways. In accordance with the provisions of the agreement of the 3rd May, 1921, between the railway companies and the three trade unions organising railwaymen,f relating to the establishment of joint councils on &quot; Whitley &quot; lines for the various railways, or groups of railways, the joint committee consisting of two representatives of each union and six representatives of the General Managers&apos; Committee of the Railway Clearing House, who met in London on the 20th May,J have drawn up a provisional scheme. The scheme is not yet final and agreed upon, but it is not anticipated that any serious amendment will be made.The scheme provides for the establishment of &quot; Local Departmental Committees,&quot; &quot; Sectional Railway Councils &quot; and &quot; Railway Councils,&quot; composed of equal numbers of representatives of the railway employees and of the railway companies concerned, and having the right to refer matters upon which they cannot agree to the next higher body. The Central Wages Board and the National Wages Board are also reconstituted, and put permanently at the head of the new railway conciliation machinery.The local departmental committees will &quot; be established at any station or depot, at which, the number of regular employees in a department exceeds 100.&quot;  The objects* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 24,11th June, p. 478, and No. 25,18th June, p. 494. t See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 21, 21st May, p. 432. j See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 22, 28th May, p. 450.(b 17435T) 3 T 2
Features of the Week-continued.of the committees are to provide a recognised means of communication between the employees and the local officials of the companies, and also to give the employees a wider interest in the conditions under which their work is performed. The committees will consider, inter alia, hours of attendance, holiday arrangements, and suggestions for im-prevements in railway methods and organisation, subject to the proviso that they shall not encroach upon the powers or decisions of any of the bodies referred to below.Sectional Railwav Councils, to the number of not more than five, will be established on each railway, or group of railways. Each Council will consider general departmental subjects affecting certain definitely defined, groups of grades, every such group being allotted a fixed number of representatives on the Council.For each railway or group of railways a Railway Council will be established. These Councils, and the Sectional Railway Councils, will deal with the local application of national agreements relating to salaries, hours of duty, &amp;c, apart from subjects to be submitted directly to the Central and National Wages Boards, as well as with certain matters of railway administration.The Central Wages Board will be composed of eight representatives of the companies and eight representatives of the employees, four of whom will be nominated by the National Union of Railwaymen, two by the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen and two by the Railway Clerks&apos; Association. The functions of this Board will be to deal with subjects relating to salaries, wages, hours of duty and conditions of service of the classes of employees included within the scheme, or any question relating to these subjects referred to them by the Sectional Railway Councils or Railway Councils.The National Wages Board will be composed of six&apos; representatives of the railway companies, six representatives of the employees, and four representatives of the users of railways,* with an independent chairman appointed by the Government.The National Wages Board will deal with subjects relating to rates of pay, hours of duty and conditions of service referred to them by the Central Wages Board, when that Board have failed to agree. No withdrawal of labour shall take place, nor shall there be any attempt on the part of any section of the employees to hamper the proper working of the railways on account of any unsettled matter falling within the purview of the Central Wages Board, before the expiration of one month after such matter has been referred by that Board to the National Wages Board, and the latter must within 28 days of any matter being referred to them publish the result of their investigations and consideration.The scheme covers the staff in the grades agreed as being within the old conciliation scheme, and, among others, stationmasters, goods and other agents, supervisory staff, and dock and. tug-boat staff.   Shopmen are not included.Industrial and Other Organisations.. National Joint Industrial Conference.- At a meeting of the trade union side of the Pro-visional Joint Committee, held on the 16th June, a statement was issued declaring that the failure of the Government to carry out the unanimous recommendations of the employers and trade unionists represented at the National Joint Industrial Conference held in February, 1919, had been considered, and it had been decided to ask for a meeting of the Provisional Joint Committee with a view to making a final effort to induce the Government to redeem their promise that the recommendations should be carried out. The recom-mendations relate to the enactment of a 48-hour week; minimum rates of wages; unemployment and its prevention; and the best means of promoting co-operation between capital and labour. It is hoped that the meeting will be held at an early date, and that steps will be taken immediately afterwards to bring the position before the Government.A similar suggestion has been put forward by the National Alliance of Employers and Employed, who maintain that the way out of the industrial crisis is to call together the National Joint Industrial Conference. It is their opinion that, if the Conference were held, and the Prime Minister would give a pledge, not that- the recommendations would be carried out, but that those which required legislation should be laid before the House of Commons without delay, there would be a perceptible lightening of the industrial situation and a hope of an early settlement.* One of the representatives of the users of the railways will he nominated by the Parliamentary Com-mittee of the Trades Union Congress, one by the Co-operative Union, one by the Associated Chambers of Commerce, and one by the Federation of British Industries.
51525.6.2UFeatures of the Week-continued.Scottish Union of Bakers and Confectioners. The annual delegate meeting of this union was held at Aberdeen from the 1.4th to the 16th June. The most important decision arrived at was that approving the establishment of a Federation of Operative Bakers of England, Scotland and Ireland. It was made clear that, under the scheme, each union would have full control of their own domestic affairs. The objects of the Federation are to achieve the abolition of night baking by legal enactment, and to further the interests of operative bakers in Great Britain, and Ireland &quot; in all political matters affecting their welfare and interests, to give mutual assistance to each of the component bodies in cases of industrial disputes,&quot; and &quot; to promote as far as possible uniformity of conditions of labour for all members of the Federation.&quot; It is hoped that the inaugural meeting of the Federation will be held in October.Wornerts Co-operative Guild. The 38th annual congress of this Guild opened in Manchester on the 14th June. It was attended by 1,360 delegates, representing 629. branches, 25 districts and 8 sectional councils, and also by representatives of a number of other co-operative organisations. There was much discussion on a resolution which declared that the only hope for a new world for the workers lay in Co-operation and Labour coming into power, with women as well as men represented in Parliament and the Govern-ment, and which called upon the Co-operative Party to support the candidature of co-operative women. The resolution was opposed on the grounds that politics should be barred from the congress, that in. the movement there were employers as well as employees, and that no political party would bring about all the reforms wanted by co-operators; but it was finally adopted with only a few dissentients.Considerable time was devoted to a long resolution on the Irish problem. Questions relating to education, child welfare and housing were also discussed; and a resolution was carried protesting &quot;against the financial policy of the Government, which continues huge expenditure on armaments, while economising on health and education.&quot; The resolution demanded the development of national care of maternity, the raising of the school age, and the provision of educational facilities in connection with Juvenile Employment Exchanges. . - w .The congress called upon the Government to solve the unemployment, problem, by restarting European trade. It was also agreed that some national scheme of family endow-ment should be introduced immediately so as to reduce the unnecessary suffering of dependent women and children. Other resolutions called for a fair representation of women on the boards and committees of co-operative societies, and urged all workers and workers&apos; organisations to invest in the co-operative movement with the object of building up a democratic system of industry and trade throughout the world. An emergency resolution extended the sympathy of the congress to all workers struggling nd suffering in the effort to maintain a reasonable standard of life. -..negotiations and disputes.Demands and Negotiations. e!     kEngineers (National). On the 17th June the executives of the &quot;Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation, &apos;tn National5! Union of Foundrymen and the National Federation of General Workers^lllued ballot1 papers in connection with the amended offer made by the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations. *It is understood that the ballot papers, which are returnable not later than ::the! 27th June, call for simple voting &quot; in favour &quot; or &quot; against.&quot; ,With the papers was issued a joint statement giving the history of the prolonged negotiations and stating that:    &quot; -. &quot; Having regard to the fact that reductions in wages have been accepted by the workmen.in other industries, and the large amount of unemployment now existing, the representatives of the unions, on the authority of the conference which decided to place before you this brief and unbiassed statement, advise members to give the matter their most serious consideration.;&quot;Dock Labourers (National). The National Joint Council for Dock Labour met on the 16th June in London.  Proposals were put forward by the representatives of the
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.National Council of Port Labour Employers for the reduction of the national standard minimum wage from 16s. per day to 12s. per clay, the reduction to be made by means of two instalments of 2s. each, to take effect on the 1st July, and the 1st September respectively. The meeting was adjourned until the 29th June to enable the representatives of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, who form the workers sicle of the Joint Council, to consider the proposals.Coal Trimmers and Tippers (National). It is reported that representatives of the shipowners, the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation and the National Union of Railwaymen, on the 16th June, discussed the employers&apos; proposals for a reduction of 30 per cent, in the existing tariff for coal trimmers, and that the negotiations were adjourned until the 14th July. In the interval, meetings of the men will be held in the various districts.It is also reported that the parties met again on the 20th June, in London, to discuss the employers&apos; proposals for reductions of wages to coal tippers. Between the present date and the 15th August, negotiations are to proceed for the purpose of coming to a permanent agreement, and in the meantime no reduction of wages will be made.Printers (National). A meeting of the executives of all the trade unions in the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation was held in London on the 16th June, to consider !the application by the employers for a national wages reduction of 15s. per week for men and 5s. for women. The proposed reduction applies to all the unions in the Federation, including the Typographical Association and the London Society of Compositors; and it embraces the entire country, including Scotland. The conference discussed in detail the employers&apos; proposals, and, although willingness to meet the employers was expressed, there was opposition to any reduction of wages at the present moment. It is stated that it will be necessary in some instances to take ballots of the unions, but no time will be lost, and a conference with the employers will be arranged at the earliest opportunity.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Coal Miners (National).-Th.e ballot vote of the members of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain has resulted in the rejection of the terms of settlement- proposed by the Government and the owners by 435,614 votes to 180,724. This gives a clear margin of over 20,000 votes in excess of the two-thirds majority necessary for the continuation of the stoppage.The miners&apos; executive met on the 17th June to receive the figures, and the result was communicated officially to the Government and owners, with a statement that in view of the result of the ballot the stoppage must continue. The executive met again on the following day, when a reply was received from the Prime Minister intimating that the Government had no option but to make final their decision that the offer of a grant of  10,000,000 to assist the industry could not remain open after the night of the 19th June.* At their meeting on this day, the executive resolved to ask the executive committees of all unions affected by wage disputes to meet them at an early date the 25th June has been suggested with the object of taking national action with the miners to &quot; secure our mutual demands.&quot;At present there is no indication of a break-away on the part of the men, and reports from the various districts show that only in very few instances are men returning to work.Cotton Textile Workers (National). A meeting of delegates of the three organisations representing the operatives in the cotton industry was held in Manchester on the 17th June, to discuss the proposed terms of settlement referred to in last week&apos;s issue of this Report. Strong opposition to the acceptance of these terms was expressed. The situation was somewhat complicated by the fact that the General Council oi the Amalga-mated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners and Twiners had previously met, and agreed to postpone their decision on the acceptance of the terms until the 23rd June, so as to allow the district associations of the amalgamation to have the terms placed before them. After considerable discussion, the delegate meeting decided by 266 votes to 227 to accept the proposed terms, but the voting was challenged, and the meeting ended in confusion.Later in the day, the Joint Negotiating Committee met and reviewed the situation. At the close of the meeting, it was officially announced that the Negotiating Sub-Committee of the operatives had requested that the meeting should be adjourned until the 24th June, in order to give some of the operatives&apos; organisations a fuller opportunity of placing the
51725.6. J]Negotiations and Disputes-continued.matter before their districts. This was agreed to. The executive of the Amalgamated Association of Operative Spinners and Twiners subsequently issued a circular to their members conveying a unanimous recommendation for the acceptance of the terms. On the 23rd June, the General Council of the Association again met, and unanimously accepted the employers&apos; terms. A ballot vote of the members of the Amalgamated Weavers&apos; Association has also been taken, and has resulted in the acceptance of the terms by 116,043 votes to 88,637. All three of the operatives&apos; organisations, the spinners, the weavers, and the cardroom workers, have, therefore, now accepted the employers&apos; terms.Settlements and Agreements.Builders (South Wales and Monmouthshire). Negotiations between the employers and operatives represented on the South Wales and Monmouthshire Building Trades Area Joint Council have resulted in an agreed code of working rules, which will operate as from the 1st July, 1921. The Joint Council covers the industrial areas from Chepstow to Haver ford west, and the working rules, the alteration of which is subject to three months&apos; notice on either side, provide that: &quot; Federated employers shall employ only trade union members who arc parties to the rules, and employees shall work only for federated employers. Exceptions to this rule, which shall only be made with the consent of the Area Council, must be registered with that body, and shall include municipal and public bodies, railways, docks, steel and iron works, tinplate and engineering works, and co-operative societies, who employ building trade labour solely on their own business premises or works.&quot; Workmen engaged on dirty or dangerous work such as sewer work, or demolishing old buildings, are to receive 2d. per hour above the standard rate, and where carpenters re-use old materials on concrete work, they are to receive an extra Id. per hour.&quot; With few exceptions piece-work and sub-contracting are not allowed.&quot; Every apprentice is to be given sufficient opportunity to learn every department of the trade to which he is bound.&quot; No worker, whilst engaged with an employer, shall be allowed to do any jobbing or other work after working hours or on Sundays or holidays for any person other than such employer,&quot; Rules for overtime, walking time, and country work follow the general building trade practice.&quot;Provision is also made for the consideration of the cause of any dispute by the trade conciliation machinery before any strike or lock-out takes place.Pen Makers (National).-An agreement has been arrived at between the British Steel Pen Makers&apos; Association and the Pen Workers&apos; Federation, for a reduction of lfrf. per hour for adult male workers, and 2s. Qd. per week for adult female workers, with propor-tionate reductions for juniors, these reductions to operate from the 10th June. This agreement cancels wages increases of a similar amount which were granted on the 15th July, 1920.Furnishing Trade Operatives (Yorkshire). Following on negotiations between the Yorkshire Employers&apos; Federation of Furnishing and Allied Trades and the furnishing trade operatives, an agreement has been reached for an immediate reduction of 3d. per hour, and a further reduction of Id. per hour on the 1st August, to be followed by a sliding scale based on the cost-of-living index number. This agreement covers Leeds, Bradford, Halifax, Keighley, Dewsbury, York and Ripon.Road Transport Workers (Lancashire and Cheshire). An agreement has been concluded between the Amalgamated Horse and Motor Owners&apos; Association and the United Road Transport Workers&apos; Association of England, for a reduction of 4s. per week in the wages of carters, motormen and their assistants, in Oldham, Royton, Shaw, Littleborough, Glossop, Hyde, Middleton, Saddleworth, Ashton, Stalybridge, Mossley and Dukinfield.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Departments section of the Report, pages 518 to 521.]
PART -IL-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.industrial relations department.MINING AND QUARRYING.Quarrying. The National Joint Industrial Council held their second annual meeting on the 13th June. A resolution was adopted urging the Ministry of Mines to nominate a representative of the slate-mining section of the slate industry to act on the Advisory Committee for the .Metalliferous Mining Industry, set up under the Mining Industry Act, 1920.The recent agreement of the chalk section for a reduction of wages was ratified. With regard to the strike of freestone quarrymen in the Yorkshire area, it was reported that the secretary of the Council and the secretary of the National Federation of Freestone Quarry Owners were in touch with the parties, and it was hoped that an early settlement would be arrived at. The Council appointed a small conciliation committee who would proceed to the district, if required, to endeavour to bring about a settlement, if the unofficial negotiations failed.FOOD AND DRINK.Brewery Worlcers (Scarborough). Notices were issued by the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers for their members to cease work at the Scarborough and Whitby Brewery on the .18th June, in consequence of a dispute regarding wages. The firm are affiliated to the Yorkshire Brewers&apos; Association, but, on account of the seasonal trade in Scarborough, they have a free hand in the regulation of wages. They are at present paying 7s. a week less than the other Yorkshire breweries. The union offered to accept 3s. 6d. per week less, but the firm have refused to consider this offer, or to meet the union officials. The Chief Conciliation Officer, Leeds, interviewed both parties, with the result that the firm.offered to maintain wages at their present level during the whole,summer season, but not to grant any increase of pay, or any retrospective pay. The manager still refused to meet the union representatives, but the secretary of the employers&apos; federation had advised him to re-consider this decision. The union left it for the men to decide whether they will accept this offer, or come out on strike.RUBBER AND ASBESTOS./Rubber Manufacturing. The joint council for the rubber heel section are reported to have agreed that the minimum rate for labourers in Lancashire and Cheshire shall be 52s. Qd. per week of 47 hours, varying at the rate of \d. per hour for each rise or fall of 10 points in the cost-of-living index number, the stated rate being based on an index number of 133. The agreement has yet to be sanctioned by the General Council of. the India Rubber Manufacturers&apos; Association. Should this sectional council prove a success, the union intend to press for the formation of joint councils for all other sections of the industry.;    ...Asbestos. At the quarterly meeting of the Joint Industrial Council on the 15th June, the question of the rates paid by the Cape Asbestos Co., Ltd., Barking, was again under . consideration-. On the 3rd May, a deputation from the Council was received by the Assistant Secretary, who informed them that the matter was one with which the Admiralty should deal, as a complaint under the Fair Wages Clause of the firm&apos;s contract. The Council had already been in communication with the Admiralty, who had replied dis-agreeing with the view expressed by the Council and asking for further particulars. It was decided to bring the matter before the Association of Joint Industrial Councils, and to pursue the matter further with the Admiralty. The secretary was instructed to ask the Chief Conciliation Officer, London, for information concerning the rates paid by good employers in other industries in the vicinity of Barking. The Chief Conciliation Officer has replied that he is not in possession of the information,
* See this B,eport, Vol. Ill, No. 14, 2nd April, p. 318.3U(b 17435t)It may be observed that a notice was posted in the works of the company on the 15th June, to the effect that, as from the 16th day, men&apos;s wages would be reduced by Id. per hour, women&apos;s wages by Id. per hour, similar reductions to take place also in July. The men have accepted the reduction, but the majority of the women, 87 in number, have ceased work. The manager is prepared to discuss the matter with a representative of their union, the National Union of General Workers.The quarterly adjustment of wages under the sliding-scale agreement resulted in a reduction of lfd. per hour for men and \\d. for women. The new rates are Is. 5fcZ. and life?, per hour respectively.TEXTILES.Wool (and Allied) Textiles. A further meeting of the Joint Industrial Council was held in Bradford on the 13th June, to receive the report of the conference of unions on the employers&apos; proposals to reduce the 15 per cent, addition to basic rates by 5 per cent., and to pay a cost-of-living wage of 100 per cent. The conference of unions had decided to reject the employers&apos; offer, and to invite them to submit further proposals. If the employers were unable to do so, the original terms would be submitted to the members with a recommendation that they should not be accepted.The two sides, separately, considered at some length proposals for bridging the difference of 5 units represented by the final proposals of each side. A deputation from the employers asked the operatives whether they were in a position to make a definite offer to accept, without further reference, a cost-of-living wage of 105 per cent, if the employers agreed to recommend that number to their executive. Later, an operatives&apos; deputation suggested to the employers that, as both sides had exhausted their mandate for a final settlement, both should agree to recommend to their constituents a reduction of 5 per cent, on the 15 per cent, addition to basic rates, and a cost-of-living wage of 105 per cent. ; that no further fall in the cost-of-living wage should take place until the index number reached 95 ; that in the event of the index number rising to 145, the cost-of-living wage should be increased to 115, and so on in proportion.The full Council ultimately adopted this proposal, and decided that the meeting should adjourn until the 27th June, in order that the proposal, if accepted, might be formally ratified by the Council.Under these proposals an adult male time-worker whose pre-war wages were 28s. \\d. per week, and whose present wage is 78s. I\d. will receive 65s. Sd., a reduction of 12s. lO^d., as compared with the reduction of 17s. %\d. originally proposed. An adult female time-worker, whose pre-war wage was 17s., and whose present rate is 45s. ll\d. will receive 38s. 2d., a reduction of 7s. 9fd., as compared with the reduction of 10s. 4jdL originally proposed.The final terms were the result of the opinion strongly expressed at the employers&apos; conference by a majority of members, that their constituents would not consent to a stoppage which could be avoided by a 2J per cent, concession. Both sides appeared to be satisfied with the settlement.PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Electricity Supply.-T.he first meeting of the Standing Election Committee of representatives of the municipal employers on the District Joint Industrial Councils* was held on the 17th June. The committee elected six municipal employer members to the National Council, and subsequently resolved unanimously that the six members so elected should also be the six municipal employer members of the National Joint Board of Em-ployers and Staff Members.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales).-A further conference of local authorities in Hertfordshire, and of trade unions representing employees in the non-trading services of those authorities, was held on the 13th June. The draft constitution for a Provincial Council for Hertfordshire was adopted. As the draft had previously been approved by the National Council, the Council is now established. Hertfordshire was originally intended by the National Council to be joined with Middlesex and Essex in the Provincial Council for the Northern Home Counties, but opposition was encountered from the Hertfordshire local authorities. Separate Provincial Councils may be established for Middlesex and Essex.
* See this^Report, Vol. Ill, No, 24, 11th June, p. 485.Tramways. A &quot;special meeting of the National Council was held on the 18th June to receive the report of a special joint committee, appointed by the Council on the 28th April, to consider and report upon the recommendations of the Court of Inquiry. The committee recommended that present rates of wages be maintained until the beginning of the first full pay period in August, and that, thereafter, wages should vary at the rate of Is. per week for each full five points of variation in the Labour Gazette index number, com-mencing from 135 ; the adjustment to be made quarterly, and to be determined, by the Labour Gazette index number for the preceding month. It was further recommended that similar adjustments be made in the case of employees under 18 years of age, at the rate of Gd. per week for each complete five points variation. The committee recommended that such agreement should be terminable by three months&apos; notice, but that no such notice should be given before the 31st December, 1921. The report was adopted by the Council. The committee were instructed to proceed with their consideration of the means to make effective the recommendations of the Court relating to observance.of agreements by undertakings, standardisation of wages, and the circumstances of the lower-paid grades.MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.G7^ss. The annual meeting of the Domestic and Fancy Ware Sectional Council wras held on the 13th June in Birmingham. It was decided to allot two seats, respectively, to the new Union of Class workers and Kindred Trades, and to the National Union of Glass Cutters and Decorators, and also to ask the National Union of General Workers and the National Flint Glass Workers&apos; Society if they wished for representation on the Council. It was reported that the National Flint Glass Workers&apos; Society had definitely decided to resign from both the National and the Sectional Council. The secretary was instructed, if this statement was confirmed, to ask the Ministry to use their good offices to influence the union to reconsider their decision, as without their co-operation the Council would not be representative, and was unlikely to continue in existence.Agriculture.- The Permanent Assistant Secretary and the Assistant Secretary conferred with the Minister of Agriculture on the 16th June on the establishment of conciliation machinery on a voluntary basis for the industry. The Minister of Agriculture had already suggested to representatives of the Farmers&apos; Union that they should ask the unions to meet them on the question, and had, apparently, indicated that unless they took the initiative, he would be obliged to convene a formal conference of both parties. His present proposal is to set up a Conciliation Board for each county. The departments progress in setting up Whitley Councils was explained to the Minister. It was also suggested to him that the proposed Boards might deal with subjects beyond those of wages and hours. A conference between the Permanent Assistant Secretary, and the president of the Farmers&apos; Union is being arranged by the Minister of Agriculture.Bone Cutters (Sheffield). At the meeting on the 18th June* a number of suggestions were made, which the employers are considering with a view to arriving at an agreed proposal. In the meantime, the 15 per cent, reduction has generally been carried out, and, in the event of a lesser reduction being agreed upon, a refund will be made.Furniture Warehousing and Removing.-The annual meeting of the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee was held on the 16th June. Mr. Godfrey, of the National Union of Vehicle Workers, was elected chairman, and Mr. J. Godclen, of Messrs. Godden and Son, East Canterbury, vice-chairman for the coming year.The employers&apos; side reported that the application from the workers&apos; side for an increase of pay had again been carefully considered, but, owing to depression in the trade, it was impossible to increase wages ; in fact, they had decided to press for a reduction. In order to do this without hardship to the men they proposed that the working week should, be increased from 48 to 54 hours. The employers&apos; proposal was strongly opposed by the men&apos;s side, and it was decided that the labour side should place the employers&apos; proposal before their constituent bodies for consideration. In dealing with this matter the question arose as to the intentions of the Government as regards the Hours Bill, and the secretary was instructed to write to the department on the matter.Malcing-Up and Baching of Textiles.&apos; Further negotiations for a permanent wages settlement for the London export packers and cloth workers were carried on at a meeting of the London District Council on the 16th June. It was finally decided that the employers

The Administrative Committee considered the question of minimum rates of wages for apprentices who are provided with board and lodging by their employers, and agreed to recommend the Board to amend their present apprenticeship scheme by making provision for such cases.Cotton Waste Reclamation Trade Board (Great Britain). After consideration of the Board&apos;s proposal to reduce the minimum rates of wages, the District Trade Committee for Scotland agreed that the minimum rates for Scottish workers should be varied in accordance with the Board&apos;s Notice of Proposal dated the 13th April. * In agreeing to the proposed variation the local representatives of workers urged that the Board should reconsider, at the first opportunity, the question of the differentiation between the Scottish and English rates for female workers. The Negotiating Committee met at Manchester to3U 2(b 17435t)in each section should submit to the workers schedules, showing the pre-war wage of each grade, the new standard wage proposed, the standard wage plus 20 per cent, the percentage increase on the 1914 wage implied in this 20 per cent, addition; and the amount which would have to he added or deducted for each rise or fall of 10 per cent, in the cost of living.Cricket Ball Manufacturers (Tonbridge). The Conciliation Board agreed to refer this dispute to arbitration. The employees&apos; side, however, would not agree to resume work, pending the result, at the reduced rates proposed by the employers, nor would the employers pay the existing rates pending the issue of the award. An officer from head-quarters has called a conference of both sides with a view to arranging an early resumption.Glove Making. At a meeting of the Industrial Council on the 13th June, it was decided that the present wages agreement, made in April last and due to expire on the 30th June, should remain in operation till the 17th September. The question will be considered again at the next meeting, on the 10th September. There is a national agree-ment providing for a week&apos;s holiday with pay, but, owing to the serious financial position of many firms in the trade, it has been decided that, while the principle of payment for holidays shall be maintained, consideration of the action to be taken this year shall be referred to the districts for local settlement.Women Workers: Wholesale Tailoring (Wigan), In May, 1916, the Amalgamated Union of Clothiers&apos; Operatives, now members of the Amalgamated Tailors and Garment Workers&apos; Trade Union, entered into an agreement under the auspices of the Home Office, providing, subject to conditions, for the introduction of women into certain branches of the wholesale clothing trade, to replace men leaving for service with the Forces. A difference has arisen between the union and Messrs. Brown &amp; Haigh, Wigan. In accordance with the agreement this difference was reported, in the first instance, to the Home Office, but was subsequently referred to this department for action. The general secretary of the union was interviewed at headquarters on the 15th June. The main point in the case is that the firm are employing women in the women&apos;s wear cutting-room, where, it is alleged, no women had. been employed before the war. The union, however, do not contest the fact that the firm, as far as possible, have reinstated all their ex-Service employees. The firm contend that the agreement was never meant to apply to the wholesale costume and mantle making section of the trade. The department are in communication with the Wholesale Clothing Manufacturers&apos; Association on the matter.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 512 to 517, 521, 522 and 527.]

The Board resolved to issue a Notice of Proposal to vary the general minimum time-rates, piece-work basis time-rates and overtime rates for male workers, the proposed variation being a reduction in the case of skilled and unskilled male workers.After consideration of a letter from the Ministry relating to the proposed re-definition of the stamped or pressed metal wares trade, and inviting a sub-committee of the Board to meet an officer of the department bo discuss the matter on the 23rd June, the Board agreed to accept the invitation.The Special Rates Committee agreed to recommend the Board co consider proposals to vary the general minimum time-rates, piece-work basis time-rates and. overtime rates at present operative in respect of all male workers, and to defer consideration of the question of varying the minimum rates of wages for female workers.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Brush and Broom Trade Board (Ireland).-Th.e Board, have issued Notices of Proposal, dated the 14th June, to fix a general minimum time-rate of Ls\ 5\d. per hour for a certain class of male workers ; a general minimum time-rate of Sid. per hour for female workers, 21 years of age and over, with lower rates for younger workers ; a piece-work basis time-rate of 9^d. per hour for female workers ; and general minimum piece-rates for both male and female workers.Hollow-ware Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 17th June, to vary the general minimum time-rates and overtime rates for male and female workers, and to fix a piece-work basis time-rate of 9d. per hour for female workers of 18 years of age or over. The proposed general minimum time-rates for male and female workers, other than learners, are Is. 2jd. and. Sd. per hour respectively ; lower rates are proposed for male and female learners.Pin, Hook and Eye and Snap Fastener Trade Board (Great Britain).-The Board have issued Notices of Proposal, dated the 17th June, to vary the general minimum time-rates, piece-work basis time-rates and overtime rates for certain classes of male and female workers, other than homeworkers; to fix similar rates for female workers other than homeworkers, employed in carding hooks and eyes or snap fasteners ; to vary the general minimum time-rate for homeworkers from 7\d. to %\d. per hour; and also to fix general minimum piece-rates.The proposed general minimum time-rates for certain classes of workers, other than homeworkers, range, according to operation, for male workers, 21 years of age and over, from Is. \\d. to Is. l\d. per hour; for female workers, 18 years of age and over, from Sd. to 8fd per hour ; with lower rates in each case for younger workers. The piece-work basis time-rate proposed for certain classes of female workers is 8fdL per hour. For female workers employed in carding hooks and eyes or snap fasteners, the rates proposed are a general minimum time-rate of 9d. per hour for workers of 18 years of age and over, with lower rates for younger workers : and a piece-work basis time-rate of l\d. per hour for all workers.The Minister has made an Order, dated the 13th June, confirming the general minimum time-rates and overtime rates as varied for certain classes of male and female workers, and as fixed for homeworkers, and has specified the 20th June as the date from which these rates,are effective.Stamped or Pressed Metal Wares Trade Board (Great J3ntam).-The Minister has made an Order, dated the 13th June, confirming the general minimum time-rates and piece-work basis time-rates, as varied for certain classes of female workers, the piece-work basis time-rates fixed for male workers, and the overtime rates as varied for male and female workers, and has specified the 27th June as the date from which these rates shall become effective.

So far as the coal dispute is concerned, the situation may be regarded as a little easier, as the result of the adoption of oil fuel, increases in the supply of gas and electricity for power, and the filtering through of supplies of coal for industrial purposes to an increased extent. The disputes in the cotton and engineering trades, however, are causing apprehension, and the immediate outlook cannot be regarded as other than distinctly unfavourable.   The principal changes reported are as follows :  ,Men&apos;s Employment.Iron and Steel At Dumbarton the engineering department of Messrs. Denny Bros., employing 800 men, and the works of Messrs. Hardie and Gordon, employing about 400 men, have practically closed down. At Leven, however, the National Steel Foundry,. Ltd., have increased their working days from three to five per week. Iron and steel and steel tube manufacturing firms in the Airdrie district expect to resume full-time working when coal supplies are available. In the Northern Division, Gateshead report that the North Eastern Railway Company&apos;s Greensfield shops have re-opened on a 4-day week.. At Stockton, Messrs. Ashmore, Benson, Pease and Co., Ltd., have re-started a substantial proportion of their employees for four days per week.At Derby, Messrs. Rolls-Royce, Ltd., have discharged approximately .1,000 hands, during the week. Messrs. Dorman and Co., Ltd., Stafford, engineers, have closed, down, retaining only the heads of departments and a nucleus clerical staff. In Wales further-discharges by the British Mannesmann Tube Co., Ltd., and by Messrs. Baldwins, Ltd., Landore, are reported.Shipbuilding and Allied Industries. On the Clyde, the Fairfield Shipbuilding and. Engineering Co., Ltd., Govan, have paid off 500 workpeople, but, at Port Glasgow, a repair-job in one of the yards has resulted in the re-employment of about 100 men. On the Tyne, Tees and Wear, small numbers of workpeople continue to be paid off as contracts, are completed. At South Shields, however, a ship-repairing job has absorbed 500 workers.. On the Mersey, ship-repairing yards in the Bootle area are showing continued activity,, but, at Birkenhead, the coal dispute and the joiners&apos; strike continue to have a depressing; effect.Textiles and Clothing. In the cotton trade, the stoppage of work in the majority of totton mills has administered a serious set-back to the revival which began to be perceptible a few weeks ago. A number of non-federated mills are continuing to run, mainly on short time, and on the reduced wages suggested by the unions, subject to later adjustment in accordance with the terms of the final settlement arranged with the federated firms.(b 17435T) 3 U 3
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.Intermittent short-time working is reported from all centres engaged in the woollen textile trade, and. there is apparently very little prospect of an early improvement even under more normal conditions. Several firms in the Sowerby Bridge district, however, are reported to have sufficient orders to last 18 months when coal supplies are available.More work has been available in the lace trade during the week, and, although a com-plete revival is not expected until the autumn, the opinion is expressed that a partial recovery would immediately follow a settlement of the coal trouble.The effects of restrictions in the supply of gas are being felt by firms in the hosiery and boot and shoe trades at Leicester. A similar difficulty at Northampton, however, has been overcome to some extent by the use of oil, benzol, and electric power. An improve-ment in the calico bleaching and printing trade is reported from Glossop and New Mills where firms are stated to be working more time than at any period during the last six months. A large silk mill in Macclesfield has resumed work as the result of obtaining supplies of coal from an old seam in the district; and coal obtained from an extensive outcrop in the Longton district has enabled the silk mills in Leek to continue work.Miscellaneous Trades. Wishing on a small scale has commenced at Wick. Better coal supplies have been available at Aberdeen and Fleetwood, and a good number of unemployed fishermen have been absorbed. At Grimsby the number of trawlers now sailing is greater than for some time past, the majority proceeding to Holland and Belgium for supplies of coal. Owing to the number of foreign fishing-boats entering the port, employment among fish-dock labourers has improved.In the pottery trade, several firms in the Burslem&apos; district have been able to procure enough outcrop coal to fire one or two ovens.At Northwich, Messrs. Brunner Mond and Co., Ltd., have been compelled to close down owing to their coal supply having become exhausted.   Some 6,35.0 men are affected.The position in the oil milling trade at Hull, continues to improve, and seed-crushing and oil mills in the Liverpool district are reported, to have large orders on hand. A firm of sugar-refiners in Liverpool have resumed operations, using oil fuel.In the Metropolitan area, unemployment in all factory districts is pronounced, and there is no prospect of increased employment until the coal cpiestion is disposed of. In the bi*ilding trade, the demand for bricklayers has shown, a distinct slackening, but plasterers are in urgent demand and are still practically unobtainable.womens Employment.Local Reports. The North-Western Division report that, as a result of the cotton dispute following that in the mining industry, employment for women generally is at a standstill. In the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division, depression continued to be very acutely felt in the staple textile industry, and the unemployment of the men is reacting on the women&apos;s registers, in that large numbers of married women, are applying for domestic work. There is, however, very little opportunity of placing them. The centres mainly affected are Armley, Bradford, Brighouse, Dewsbury, Chesterfield, Keighley, Shipley and Batley. At Todmorden the 3,000 cotton workers on the women&apos;s register have been wholly unemployed for six weeks.There appears to be a slightly more cheerful feeling in the South Midlands and Eastern Division. It is thought that there will be a considerable improvement all round when the coal strike is over. Better reports are received in regard to the boot industry. Northamp-ton state that endeavours are being made to use electric or oil power in a number of factories. A firm at Wellingborough are reported to be substituting single women by married women at a lower wage. This is the first instance of this kind that has been noticed. Reports in regard to the paper and printing trade in this division, are somewhat better. The silk industry continues depressed, but there is some improvement in the hosiery trade. Clothing machinists are gradually returning to work at Colchester and Northampton; Leicester report that, although there are nearly 6,000 women still on the live register, more vacancies have been notified during the week than has been the case for some little time.The fruit-picking season has started at Canterbury and Maidstone, and King&apos;s Cross are again acting as the clearing centre for London applicants for the Wisbech fruit district.Reports of continued grave unemployment come from the West Midlands Division, where both the pottery and metal industries are dependent on adequate fuel supplies.- The South-Western Division report that there are now no local supplies of coal and that, in spite of indications that trade is improving, there can be no real reduction in
appointments and training.APPOINTMENTS AND CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT,APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 10th June, the department placed 263 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 55,845. Of these, 7,232 have been placed through the agency of the department^ Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 551 ex-Service men and 22 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 10th June was 11,754 ex-Service men and 1,301 civilians. - At the same date 816 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 331 having been registered during the week.Employment and Insurance Department-continued.unemployment until fuel is again available. A cigar factory in Bristol lias reopened and 300 women have resumed short-time work. Bristol further report that the review of applicants from the point of view of domestic employment has increased the numbers placed. The supply of workers to seasonal resorts is said to be progressing favourably in this division as a result of arrangements made at a conference of the Exchanges concerned.&apos;The Wales and Northern Divisions report that there is practically no change in the industrial situation. Scotland state that there is generally a more hopeful outlook, and that there is some expectation of a general trade revival after the coal dispute is over.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Unemployment Insurance. The policy of paying unemployment insurance benefit to short-time workers has been adversely criticised by several committees. Hyde suggest that no person be allowed to claim unemployment insurance benefit who is in receipt of more than  2 per week in wages, while the Goole Wbmen&apos;s Sub-Committee are of opinion that no person working short time should receive any benefit for the days when he is not working, as such persons are not available for whole-time employment.Women&apos;s Work. The memorandum relating to the provision of outfits for domestic servants on behalf of the Central Committee on Women&apos;s Training has been unfavourably received by several committees. Doncaster are of opinion that the principle involved is wrong. Worksop have expressed the view that such expenditure is unnecessary, and that uniform should be provided, if required, by the applicant and the employer, by means of deductions from wages. The committee regret that they cannot comply with the request of the Minister to undertake the task of interviewing such applicants.JUVENILE BRANCH.Visits to Works (Kilmarnock). The Kilmarnock Juvenile Advisory Committee have arranged visits of school-leaving children to local works and factories. Many children have in this way been given an opportunity of obtaining an insight into the various pro-cesses connected with each trade, and the experience thus gained is valuable to the children in choosing a career. Employers have given full support to the committee&apos;s work, by arranging for the children to be conducted through the works and to receive detailed explanations of the different processes.Building Trade Classes (Bristol). The question of the payment of school fees for students attending the building trade classes has been engaging the attention of the Bristol Building Trades Joint Standing Apprenticeship Committee. The views of the various operatives&apos; societies have been sought on the question, and disclose a general opinion that the school fees should be a charge on the industry, and the books and equipment a charge on the guardian and the apprentice. The committee concurred in this view, and passed a resolution accordingly. The matter is now to be brought before the Master Plumbers&apos; Association with a view to obtaining their co-operation.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on pages 512, 513, 515 and 527.]
Appointments and Training-continued.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Business Training Scheme. Daring the week ending the 10th June, the department received one application for training under this scheme, bringing the total number of applications to 3,296 of which 1,914 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 830 cases. At the same date 192 vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 16 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The department have dealt with a total of 1,234 cases, in 547 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed training in 351 cases, and abandoned training in 46 ; 120 are still in training, and 30 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT.INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men,Statistics. On the 14th June, 23,668 men were in. training, as against 23,840 on the 7th June, and 24,326 on the 17th May. During the week 312 men were placed in training. There were 16,743 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 7th-June and the 17th May being 16,755 and 16,343. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 33,752, the totals for the 7th June and the 17th May being 33,268 and 31,811.Inspections. The East Moors Government Instructional Factory, Cardiff, was visited on the 9th June by the Prince of Wales, who, accompanied by the Lord Mayor of Cardiff, inspected the men at work in the various trades in which instruction is given. The men in training here are largely engaged on productive work ; cash sales during the month of May amounted to over  500 and there were contracts in hand at the close of the month to the value of over  1,600. His Royal Highness accepted a pair of hand-sewn, boots as a memento of his visit, and expressed to the manager his appreciation of the standard of the work carried out, and the general arrangements of the factory.On the 6th June Princess Mary visited the Government Instructional Factory at Garrison Lane, Birmingham. Her Royal Highness made a complete tour of the Factory and, before leaving, accepted a bric-a-brac cabinet, presented to her on behalf of all the trainees. At the close of her visit the Princess expressed the pleasure which her visit had given her, and her surprise at, and interest in, the high standard of ability displayed by the workers.Government Instructional Factories. During the past week there has been a decrease of 141 in the number of men in training in. Government Instructional Factories and the total has fallen to 11,160.The organisation of the Claydon Factory, Ipswich, is now complete. A large number of local orders have been received during the month, the majority of which can be traced to the publicity given by the recent exhibition at Ipswich. The painting and decorating class are engaged on redecorating the factory, and the rural handicrafts class have sufficient local orders in hand to last three or four months. When first taken over by the agricultural class the grounds were in a most dilapidated condition ; they have now been turned into productive gardens, which supply all the vegetables required by the hostel, to the value of about  300, or the equivalent of the annual rent of the Factory.National Trade Advisory Committees : Brush Trade. At a meeting of this committee m on the 6th June, a discussion took place respecting the disposal of goods in Government Instructional Factories or technical schools. It was unanimously recommended that such goods should be absorbed by Government departments, and not placed on the open market.Local Technical Advisory Committees : Vehicle Building. After negotiations extending over several months, it has been possible to obtain nominations for a committee at Southampton, and it is proposed to hold the first meeting on the 20th June.
Appointments and Training-continued.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up.to the 1st June, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 46,454 apprentices, under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 44,307 apprentices, employed by 17,612 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 26,434.- Unemployment. In the West Midlands area, the number of boys under 18, at present unemployed is reported to be 11,000. In addition, there are a large number on short time. Such figures are typical of all areas. In Northampton, special classes have been organised by the education committee for unemployed youths from 16 to 18, at which it is proposed to teach English, arithmetic and physical drill. Moreover, attendance will be compulsory in order to qualify for unemployment benefit. Boys between the ages of 14. and 16 will attend the ordinary day classes at the technical school. A report from Wales indicates that a slight revival in the coach-building industry is apparent.Institutional Training. Arrangements have been completed for setting up the whole-time summer class at the Royal Technical College, Glasgow. Special, instructors and a member of the college staff interviewed 51 apprentices to ascertain their standard of education. Only 25 per cent, of these youths had attended, evening classes since they left school. They are being graded, and it is hoped to draw up a syllabus of work for each grade which will lead on. definitely to a higher step in evening class work during the winter.No reduction was obtainable in the estimate quoted by the London County Council for special engineering classes. A very reasonable quotation has, however, been sub-mitted by the Loughborough Technical College. Classes will be formed as required, and special instructors will be provided by the college, if necessary. It is hoped thus to dispose of a large number of the apprentice applicants.General Training.Apprenticeship : Building. Joint conferences of employers and operatives were held at Leamington and Rugby during April, when it was decided to set up apprenticeship committees. Further meetings are to be held for that purpose. At Leamington, Parts I and II of the scheme were agreed upon, and it was decided to request the local educational authority to nominate three representatives, and also a representative directly concerned with the teaching of the trade. It was suggested that the National Joint Industrial Council be asked to supply literature relating to the crafts, and the opportunities which they offer to boys, for the information of Juvenile Employment Committees. Joint conferences held at Lincoln and Chesterfield were not successful. As the result of an eleventh-hour decision, the master builders in Lincoln did not attend, though the operatives were fully represented, and offered their co-operation. Further endeavours will be made to bring about a joint conference.The extent of the industry at Oxford, in which town and district there are 50 associated master builders, is considered large enough to warrant the formation of an apprenticeship committee. The builders are engaged to a large extent upon very high-class work in connection with the college buildings. Apprentices have, therefore, unusual opportunities to become highly skilled. The city and county educational authorities welcome the scheme as a means of providing adequate technical instruction, which is badly needed. Master builders at Gloucester have now expressed their willingness to give favourable consideration to the scheme. The majority of employers at Swindon are against the trade unions or any other body being represented on an apprenticeship committee, but it is thought that they will be influenced by the decision of Gloucester.A successful meeting of operatives in the Cleveland district was held at Stockton-on-Tees on the 2nd June. At Darlington the employers have already signified their approval of the scheme and merely await the decision of the operatives.[References to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on pages 515 and 525.]
