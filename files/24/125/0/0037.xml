His Majesty1s Government have been invited by the French G-overnment to participate in an Inter-Allied Colonial Exhibition to be held in Paris in 1925.   They have also been asked to bring the matter to the notice of .the Governments of other parts of the Empire.   In support of their intention to hold this exhibition, the French Government urge that it will serve to commemorate the military and economic assistance which the Dominions and Colonies of the Allies rendered &quot;to their respective Mother countries during&apos; the war.   They also suggest that a comprehensive exhibition em-* bracing all the Allied colonising powers will assist in arriving at a true assessment of the most successful methods of colonisation, and they propose to hold in connection with the exhibition a series of conferences on colonial problems.2, It is to be assumed that the exhibition will not be limited to colonial products, and that not only will shipping companies, railway companies, and other organisations interested in colonial development be represented, but that exhibits of goods manufactured from colonial products and of goods specially adapted for colonial use will also be included.   The holding of the British Empire Exhibition in 1923 or 1924 will afford participants in that Exhibition an opportunity of utilising their exhibits again at Paris should they decide to be represented there.3. After consultation with commercial interests in the United Kingdom, His Majesty1s Government aro inclined to doubt whether the advantages likely to accrue to British trade from participation in such an exhibition would be commensurate with
In 1907 His Majesty&apos;s Government appointed a Committee on which business interests were represented to enquire into the benefits accruing to British arts, industries, and trade from participation in great international exhibitions, The general conclusions of -the committee were that there are serious(objections to public expenditure on international exhibitions regarded solely as a means of directly increasing the trade of individual firms, but that on other grounds this oounj&amp;ry could not . ford to refuse participation.     The fcommittes made recommendations for securing co-ordination of effort with a view to ensuring impressive exhibits, and for providing continuity of organisation from one exhibition to another.   As a result of the.se recommendations His Majesty&apos;1 s &apos; (government constituted the   Exhibitions Branch of the Board oftho. cost involved,   liominion Governments may, however, see a more direct prospect of advantage from their standpoint and I suggest that the Imperial Cabinet should be invited to give an opinion on this point,4,   It appears likely that other proposals for international exhibitions in which the British Empire as a whole may be interested, will be brought forward from time to time, and it seems desirable that some machinery should be set up for the joint preliminary examination of such projects.5.   A note is appended summarising.the action taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the past in regard to international exhibitions.SMLBY BALDWIN.13th June, 1921.APPENDIX.Action taken in the Past by His Majesty1s Government in regard to International Exhibitions.
Trade, which, organised British Sections at International Exhibitions at Vienna and Brussels in 1910;   at Rome and Turin in 1911;   at Buenos Aires in 1912;   at Ghent in 1913;   and at Leipzig and Paris in&quot; 1914.   Tho functions of the &quot;Exhibitions Branch have now been assumed by the Department of Overseas Trade.2, In the meantime it had begun to be felt that the numberof those exhibitions was becoming excessive and burdensome,and an international conference on the.question was held whiohresulted in 1912 in a Convention signed at Berlin by most of theimportant trading countries.   Drastic restrictions were suggestedin the Convention on the holding oi International exhibitions.The most important were that no universal International exhibitionshould be held in any one of the signatory countries more frequently than once in every ten years, and that no signatorycountry should participate in an international exhibition more frequently than once in three years.   The Convention owing to thewar was not ratified by the Powers concerned, and the question has remained in abeyance.3. It may be added that the cost to His Majesty*s Government...of participation in such exhibitions in the past has been considerable.    Twenty three international exhibitions held between 1853 and 1906 cost the Government .2638,000.   The Exhibition at St. Louis in 1904 cost  128,000, the Paris exhibition of 1867  120,000, and the Paris exhibition of 1900  97,000.   At present prices the cost of participation would be very much higher.4. The above notes It should be explained relate only to large international exhibitions as distinct from trade fairs. These fairs are, generally speaking, devoted to the direct transaction of business rather than to affording a spectacle and an opportunity for amusement.   They are short in duration;
participation is comparatively cheap to the exhibitor;   and the fairs can be organised by Governments on a self-supporting basis.   Such fairs are likely to be very much more popular with the trading community as a means of developing trade than international exhibitions on the old lines.r.   4   -
