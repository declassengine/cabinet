GENERAL.There is little change to report in the industrial situation during the period under review. The more extensive adoption of oil as fuel and the increased supplies of gas and electricity are reported to have slightly eased the effects of the coal stoppage in certain areas. The dispute in the engineering trade is, however, causingmmmmmm_-__iimii i .I.IHMI hip......aim Mil i in w- in ibbi.ii - mm i m i iTr---1---------------mm.....nun mimmh.....r   &apos;        wmw.........MMmmmmm        11    I--------------apprehension.II. EMERGENCY WORK.As announced by the Prime Minister on the 19th October, certain schemes have been put in hand by the Local Authorities in conjunction with the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Health, and by the Local Authorities themselves, designed to secure work for unemployed men, preferentially ex-Service men. The following is the result at this date: (a.) New Arterial Roads.21,851 men employed up to date (in and around London, 2,980; Provinces, 18,871).(hi.) Road Maintenance.Tt is estimated that employment has been provided for approximately 20,000 men over and above those ordinarily so employed.(c.) Housing (Acceleration of the Lay-Out of Roads and Sewers and Approved Housing Schemes).Men employed up to the 10th June, 2,913 (in and around London, 283: Provinces, 2.630).(d.) Lord St. Davids&apos; Committee.Men employed on work other than the above up to the 10th June. 33,870 (in and around London. 5,399; Provinces, 28,471).(e.) Alternative Work in Government Establishments.War Office establishments: men employed up to the 11th June, 2,769 (in and around London, 2,045; Provinces, 724).Alternative work provided in Admiralty establishments: men employed up to the 11th June, 6,584 (in and around London, nil; Provinces. 6,584).(f.) Short-time in Government Establishments.Number of men who have found employment up to date as a result of the intro-duction of short-time system. Men employed up to the 11th June: War Office estab-lishments, 2,041 (in and around London, 1,888; Provinces, 153) ; Admiralty estab-lishments, 3,254 (in and around London, 191; Provinces, 3,063).(g.) Emergency Work found by Local Authorities.Total number of men employed up to the 10th June, 12,337 (in and around London, 2,021; Provinces, 10,316).Total labour employed on above schemes = 105,619.As reports for the week ended the 10th June have been received from only 386 Local Authorities, out of 420 who were asked to furnish information, it is probable that the Relief Schemes which have been inaugurated by the Government and Local Authorities are finding employment for a number of men in excess of the figures given.Housing (Labour Position).On the 1st June there were 76,242 skilled men employed on housing schemes in England and Wales, and 63,797 unskilled.[The additional labour still required was 5,772 skilled men and 341 unskilled.]&quot; [6479]  .    &apos;
III. 50,000 EX-SERYICE MEN TO BE TRAINED IN THE BUILDINGINDUSTRY.The industrial stagnation caused by the coal stoppage, and the consequent uncertainty of the outlook, have seriously interfered with the progress of this scheme. The employers, however, have set up District Committees in. many of the more important industrial centres, and&apos; it is understood that they will shortly be posting notices on all jobs advising their workpeople that the job is only open to men willing to work with and assist in the training of ex-Service men taken on under the scheme. This action has already been taken in London by the Master Builders and also by the Office of Works.In addition steps are being taken to make it clear that contracts for building and constructional work in which the Government is financially interested will in general be confined to contractors who are employing men under the conditions of the scheme.In the meantime, the total applications are 18,381. In the London and South-Eastern Division 7,821 men have applied, and the following are figures for other Divisions: South Midlands and Eastern Counties, 1,242; South-Western Counties, 1,605; West Midlands, 1,911; Yorkshire and East Midlands 1,627; North-Western Counties, 2,388; Northern Division, 506; Scotland, 1,067; Wales, 214.IY.  PAYMENT OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT AND OUT-OF-WORKDONATION.1. The following statement represents the position as shown by the Exchange registers on the 10th June: 	Men.	Women.	Total.Numbers wholly unemployed Numbers on short time*	1.521,060 482,956	501,695 304,167	2,022,755 787,123fTotal......	2,004,016	805,862	2,809,8782. As a result of the operation of the Act of the 3rd March, 1921 (and of the grant of Out-of-Work Donation to ex-Service men and women), the following work-people are in receipt of Unemployment Benefit or Out-of-Work Donation :-				Men.	Women.	Total.Wholly unemployed (estimated) On short tiine*	1,484,051 482,956	468,564 304,167	1,952,615 787.1231Total	1,967,007	772,731	2,739,738* There is no record of the numher of workpeople on short time, who are not eligible to receive Unemployment Insurance or Out-of-Work Donation, i.e., tho^e who are employed in such a way that they are unable to comply with the rules as to continuity of unemployment.f The diminution this week is clue to the exclusion of cotton workers in consequence of the Trade Dispute.o
