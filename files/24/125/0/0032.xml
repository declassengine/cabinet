\   ; OABINETThe Barcelona Conventions on Transit and C^nmiunic at ions.-  1  (Memorandum by the President of the Board of TradedSir H.Llewellyn Smith, the British Delegate to the Conference on Communications and Transit which met at Barcelona under the auspices of the League of Nations in March and April has now made his report, and copies of the report and of the documents prepared by the Conference have &quot;been circulated to the Departments directly interested.-It has now to he decided whether His Majesty shall &quot;be advised to ratify the two Conventions, namely the Convention relating to Freedom of Transit, and the Convention relating to the Regime of Navigable T/aterways of International concern, as well as the Declaration on the Right to a Flag of Landlocked. States, if, (as is uncertain) the last-named required ratification--It has also to be decided whether the British Delegate shall be authorised to sign the Additional (optional) Protocol on the Navigation of National Waterways.As my predecessor pointed out when submitting the draft Conventions to the Cabinet (CP,2004) they followed closely the general principles which were strongly advocated by the British Empire delegation at the Peace Conference, and the amendments introduced into the Conventions at Barcelona conflict in no way with those principles,   The aasndments to the Transit Convention, Indeed, meet all the points of difficulty which were noted in -the examination of the draft Convention by theDepartments interested before the Conference.-The Waterways Convention involved questions on whioh there is a conflict between the interests of the great maritimepowers/
powers who desire the most liberal regime possible, and those of riparian states who wish in varying degrees to limit the navigation rights of non-riparians and the obligations of riparians as regards upkeep,   While the Convention in its final*form is necessarily a compromise between these views I agree with the view expressed in the British delegated report that the Convention as signed is on the whole more favourable to British interests than the original draft which it replaces.The Additional Protwool on National Waterways is a new and optional agreement which has not yet been signed by the British Delegate.   It provides for the reciprocal admission of ships flying the flags of any of the states which may acoept it tc participation on an equal basis in direct import and export trade on waterways which do not fall under the definition of &quot;Navigable Waterways of international Concern&quot;,   It can be adopted in either of two alternative forms, one confined to &quot;natural&quot; Waterways, and one extended to all navigable waterways accessible to ordinary commercial navigation to and from the sea*   So far as concerns the United Kingdom the  eaaaer and wider alternative form represents our existing practice, and I recommend that it should be adopted, and that the British delegate be authorised to sign the Protocol in this form. Colonies, protectorates etc, may be either included or excluded, and in any case there is provision for- separate denunciation in their cases   Ho doubt the Colonial Office will advise what exclusions if any should be made.The Declaration with regard to the Right to a Flag only generalises the principle already laid down in the Treaties of Peace as between Allied and Associated Powers,  -3, Taken as a whole the work of the Barcelona  onfercnoemust be regarded as a substantial achievement,, in that it has resulted in the embodiment in agreements of liberal       ;provisions/
provisions safeguarding the right of all participating States to freedom of communications. No power can be more interested than the British Empire in the securing of such agreements, and as our practice has generally been liberal in the past, it in unlikely that any substantial modification of existing practice will be necessary as a consequence of ratification. No alteration of practice and no legislation will be necessitated in the United Kingdom.

Accordingly I have no hesitation in advising the ratification of each of the agreements referred to above, as soon as they are officially communicated to His Majesty&apos;s Government through the Council of the League of Nations. It would produce a good effect if the British representative on the Council were able to announce at the forthcoming meeting on June 17 that His Majesty&apos;s Government is prepared to advice ratification.

5. I may add that the Foreign Office and Ministry of Transport concur in the above recommendation.



                                                         STANLEY BALDWIN.

10th June, 1921.
