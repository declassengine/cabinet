HOUSING OF GOVERNMENT STAFFS: ENQUIRY AS TO the interim report of the Committee appointed by the Cabinet. (Meeting 38 (31))The Right Hon. Sir Eric Geddes, G.C.B., G.B.E., M.P., Minister of Transport.Chairman.Members.Sir M.G. Ramsay, K.C.B.        )R.S. Meiklejohn, Esq., C.B, )H.M. Treasury.Sir Lionel Earle, K.C.B., K.C.V.O.,)C.M.G., J.P.        )H.M. Office of Works. Sir Arthur Durrant, C.B.E., M.V.0, )E.N. de Normann.   H.U. Office of Works.      Secretary.Terms of Reference.wTo consider and determine as to the Departments or Branches of Departments to be accommodated in the new government buildings now in course of erection at Acton.&quot;In view of the desirability of terminating the continued occupation of the temporary buildingB in the Parks and London County Council gardens, and on roofs of public buildings and having regard to the increased cost of central accommodation, the Committee is further instructed to consider and report to the Cabinet as to the extent to which Departments or Branches of Departments now accommodated oentrally might &quot;be transferred to outlying areas.*(Away on leave and has not yet been able to attend the meetings of the Committee).
The Committee have decided with the consent.,of the Department involved, ;to allocate the new government building at Acton to the Ministry of Pensions Issues Branch, approximately 5000 in number, at present housed in temporary buildings in Regent&apos;s Park.in regard to the major term of reference - the extent to which Departments now accommodated oentrally might be transferred to outlying areas - the preliminary Investigation by the- Committee shows that there were 29,279 Civil Servants in the Headquarters Staffs of the Government on the 1st of August, 1914 and that there are now 70,498 an increase of 41,200,     This increase is made up roughly of the 20,000 personnel of the new Departments, and of 21,000 additional staff in the old Departments, due largely to the extra services which have been undertaken.Reference to Appendix A, Part 2, will show that the Ministry of Health has increased by 1,800 on the pre-war figures and the Post Office&apos;by 3,500,    As regards the War Departments, the Admiralty has increased by 3,100 and the War Office by 5,100.    The Board of Trade shows an increase under various heads: 2,500 in the Board of Trade proper as an old Department; 1,100 in the Food Department and 650 in the Shipping Department.Appendix A, Part 3, shows the allocation of staffs among the new Departments or Sub-rDepartments created during or since the war.     These are Treasury figures and correspond approximately with the Office of Works figures quoted later.     (The difference between the two is explained by the fact that the Office of Works&apos; figures do not include Post Office and India Offioe personnel Law Courts, messengers, cleaners, caretakers, etc.)The existing arrangements for the housing of the present Btaffs may be classified as follows.    Within a radius of a mile from the Horse Guards, there are 17,000 staff housed in Crown Buildings, and 18,000 in leased or temporary buildings, making a total of 35,00o altogether.In the second area which is from 1-2 miles radius of Whitehall, there are 1,300 in Grown Buildings and 10,500 in leased or temporary buildings, making 11,800 in all      There are 8,500 in the outlying area beyond the 2 mile radius.As a line of approach to the problem of securing more economical accommodation, we have in the first place assumed that all staff not housed in Crown Buildings in the first and second areas    that is to say, within two miles of Whitehall - should be moved to the third area - beyond two miles of Whitehall - but before it is possible to arrive at the number of staff to &quot;He so transferred, the necessary preliminary is to ensure that the Crown Buildings are adequately occupied.To-day the Crown Buildings within two miles of Whitehall hold 18,300 staff.     If they were filled to their full oapacity, allowing per person a reasonable number of superficial feet, it -should be possible to house 21,850 therein, leaving the remainder - roughly 25,000 -to be moved outside the two miles radius.    If this number oould be moved, the Office of Works estimate that they could be accommodated in the outlying area at an average cost per annum of  16 per head, as against  40 per head
head per annum, within&quot;two miles of Whitehall.     This would result in a saying of  600,000 per annum.     On the other hand, allowance should he made for loss of efficiency due to decentralisation and for the expenditure of time and money incurred in travelling to and from the centre and in the conveyance of papers.     The financial importance of these considerations should be email.It should be clearly understood that these conclusions are somewhat arbitrary as they pre-suppose (a) acquiescence of Departments in the principles of economy of space in the central area and decentralisation of routine staff and (b) authority for capital expenditure on the provision of new buildings should it prove impossible either to hire sufficient accommodation in the outlying area or to encourage the erection by private enterprise of buildings which oould be taken on lease for a period of years.As the Committee see the jphoblem; this decentralisation, Jifter1 a forecast of reductions in staff has been given, communication be made effeotive only by entrusting full Cabinet authority to an individual or to a Committee to take deoisive action.    This individual or Committee should have power, after thorough enquiry and adjudication upon the many objections which will certainly be raised, to issue instructions for the removal to outlying areas of such staffs as can, in his or its opinion, be suitably decentralised.It would be beyond the ability of this Committee to undertake a detailed examination into the work of the various Departments in order to colleot adequate data upon which the suggested pronouncement could be made, and it is therefore proposed that a Sub-Committee consisting of three - one, an independent officer of adequate standing, one, an officer of similar rank from the    V. Treasury, and one, of similar rank from the Offioe of Works - should be appointed to investigate the work of the Government Departments concerned, with authority to oall for all relevant information from the Departments who should be instructed to offer every facility.Such a Sub-Committee would be able to compare and weigh the necessity of Departments or Sub-Departments being housed in the central area, and viewing the problem as a whole, would be able to adviBe as to the desirability of moving Departments to the outlying area, but it is obviously impossible for such a Sub-Committee to undertake usefully a task of this kind until the general question of reduction of staffs in new and old Departments is taken in hand independently.    That task, from the terms of reference, is beyond the scope of this Committee!s functions.(Sd.) eric Geddes. &quot;    Malcolm G. Ramsay.* Lionel Barle.* Arthur I.
