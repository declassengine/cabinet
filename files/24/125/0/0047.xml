THIS DOCUJiMT IS THE KlOlTEOT OF 2IB TUSIWIO Wfffl!S GOVEEKbSEITT-CABINET. ---. i....... i.....,,.^-^ j    rEKGTJEEIOTG TRADE dispute memorandum BY TEE MINISTER OP LABOUR *ecret The negotiations between the Engineering and.p.046. Rational Employers1 Federations and the various Trade Unionsconnected with the Engineering Trade do not at present show signs of coming to a successful conclusion.    In all probability there will be a national stoppage in the Engineering Trade, the Unions refusing to work at the reduced wages proposed by the Employers.     The reductions begin in part in the week commencing next Sunday.As an Engineering stoppage will be a matter of most serious concern to the country, and will undoubtedly add to the already hoavy unemployment. J, think that my colleagues will be interested to know the main facts of the situation.During the war wages In the Engineering Trade were regulated by the Committee on Production, the Standing Arbitration Tribunal9which every four months decided what revision, if any, of wages should take place.   The practice of appearing before the Committee periodically obtained in. a number of different industries.in September of last year the Unions withdrew from this arrangement and reverted to their pre-war practice of direct negotiations with their Employers1 Associations.   As a result of these negotiations wages were stabilised for six/months/411b.
a.*months at the then existing rates as from September 16th,1920.During the last few months negotiations have been proceeding on the rates to be payable from June 16th, that let from the end of this period of six months.   At thebeginning of April the Employers proposed a reduction of 6s/-per weok, and in addition to that, the withdrawal of the 12j$ munitions bonus.Long negotiations between the parties have taken placej   indeed. It Is doubtful whether more protracted negotiations have ever taken place before in this trade. So far *io agreement has&apos; been reached.   The Employers have modified their proposals in various ways, and the latest modification is ae7followej-The I2fef0 to be taken off in three equal parts inJune, July and September.3e/- per week to be taken off base rates as distinct from war advances in ectober.A further 3s/- to be taken off war advances earlyin November, but only if the Index No, of the dost ofLiving falls to 115.There are certain immaterial variations as regards piece-workers.yesterday and the day before protracted negotiations took place? b&amp;t the Employers could not persuade the fnions to recommend these terms to their members   the mionsi of course, be^ng of the opinion that, however^ the reduction may be spread, the total amount proposed is excessive.The-Tiegotlations this week have tak$n place as a result of arrangements made by me.    The parties had already/reached
reached a deadlock but I Interviewed them &quot;both..separately and arranged for a further conference in the hope that they would be able to reach an agreement.   This they have failed to do, but I am still continuing my efforts.   She. Employers-are so far not prepared to agree to submit the matter to arbitration.   But I have not put the point finally to them.       They contend that the reduction of the amount proposed is necessary in the interests of the industry i and that in ordor to enable their members to quote firm prices they must have an agreement on the whole amount , now, no matter whether the whole reduction takes place immediately or in stages.Like the Employers the Unions are so far not prepared to agree to arbitration but are pressing me to appoint a Oourt of Inquiry under Part II of the Industrial Courts Act.   Their attitude is Influenced by a wages settlement which has recently been reached in the Shipbuilding industry where a reduction of 6s/- has been agreed.     They do not feel able to recommend a heavier reduction than this, and their attitude is also affected by the fact that in the ballot of the unions in the Shipbuilding trade the votes of tho Craft Unions showed a large majority against the reduction^ while the labourers  Unions voted heavily in favour, and so carried the day.I have seen both sides this morning and although at the moment it Is not possible to express any hope that the stoppage may be avoided I have arranged a further joint meeting.(intd.)
