SECEET,CP.CABINET.I circulate to my colleagues the following telegram which I have received from the Viceroy with reference to Greece and Turkey.E. S. M.27th June 1921.Telegram, from Viceroy to the Secretary of Stale for India, dated23rd June 1921.&apos;I cannot too strongly impress upon His Majesty&apos;s Government the injurious effect that will be produced in India if Britain helps Greece against Turkey; and not only among the Moslems but also among the Hindus who will (? regard.) such British action as contemptuous disregard of Indian opinion. However good the explanation may be of British action in siding with Greeks, it will be accepted here as assistance to the Christian against the Moslem. Again, it is useless to urge that we should be acting against Angora Government and not against Khalifa -the view is that Sultan is not a free agent. I am not unmindful of the difficulties that beset (? His Majesty&apos;s Government), but I feel bound to represent the seriousness of the situation that will be caused in India by Britain becoming associated with Greeks against Turks, for we should then have to face very troublesome agitation. I do not wish to exaggerate its effects, for of course we should be prepared, and would meet it, but the political result will be serious and will, I fear, make it impossible to pursue policy of conciliation.mS     100  6.21[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet June 1921.
