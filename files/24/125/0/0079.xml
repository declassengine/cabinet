9578\11* Copy of letter r.&apos;ate&apos;d Kay 23rd, 1921, from Sir I aurioe Hankey to P.r. Churoni11.Dear london. Churchill,On the list of subjects awaiting consideration by theCabinet, the follow in-* papers appeartono: by the Tirst Lord of the Admiralty C.r,903. Memo: by Bir H. Home CP. 1085.Memoranda by the kini?:;ter in Charge of the PetroleumDepartment CP.. 1118, C.P.1524, CP. 2110. Memo: by the S/S for India, C.P. 1607. Memo: by the Pirst Lord of the Admiralty CP* 1554.These papers deal with two questions, viz, the approval of the Anglo-Prench Petroleum Agreement, and the policy to be adopted towards the production of oil in Mesopotamia.   The former question was disposed of at San Remo when the agreement was confirmed by the *Time Linister and     fciillerand (See Appendix to CP. 1524); but no decision has yet &quot;been taken by His Majesty*b Government on the I-esopotaaian question, and in particular on the question whether development should. be carried out by the British Government directly or by arrangement with private companies such as the Turkish Petroleum Company.I should bo  grateful if you would let me know whether,as the Finister responsible for Iesopotamia, you desire theoepapers to be brought once more to the notice of the Cabinet.Yours sincerely,,(Sgd.) K.P.A.2. Copy i of letter d*,teft dune 20th, 3,921,, from fcr. Churchill &quot;t o Sir Laurie e&quot; Ea nkcy. *jMy dear Hankey,layI have your letter of the 23r4/ on tho subject of the policy to be adopted towards the production of oil in Mesopotamia.   It &quot;npears to me that the question whether development should bo oarried out by the British Government directly or by arrangement with private companies such as the,-&apos; t IJTurkish Petroleum Company has already been decided in advance
by the correspondence which has passed between the Foreign Office and the United States Government in which it was definitely stated that the provisions of the Anrjo-French Petroleum Agreement in regard to Mesopotamia were based upon the Turkish Petroleum Company^ claims.   I do not see how we can at the same time justify the exclusion of other oil interests from Mesopotamia *on the ground that the claims of a private company are valid and adopt any other policy than that of development by private companies once the mandate is in force.   In any case I see no possibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government developing Uesopotamian oil directly.   The only government which could develop would be tjie Government of Mesopotamia and it would, in my opinion, be far more satis-factory if the development were in the hands of a British company than in those of an Arab government over which our control will be hypothetical.I have very carefully considered the whole question of Mesopotamia oil in its relations to the draft mandate which is shortly to be discussed by the Council of the League of Hations.   It appears to me that our representative on the Council ought to be placed in a position to .^ive a clear state-ment of the policy of,Mis Majesty&apos;s Government in their capacity as adviser to -the Arab Government of the future and I suggest for your consideration that he should be instructed, in the event of any enquiries boin^ made, to reply on the following lines:**In the event of the Mesopotamian Government accepting the validity of the undertaking given to the Turkish Petroleum Company by the Turkish Government (or in the event of any other similar concession bein&apos;: so recognised) Eis Majesty&apos;s Government propose to advise the Arab Government of Mesopotamia to inform the Company (concerned) that they will be required at the end of a stated period not exceeding fifteen years to select the
area or areas not exceeding a total of X aquare milea in which the concession shall be operated and that a lease will then be concluded for the development of the concession within those areas for a period not exceeding seventy years, terms as regards rents, royalties, etc. being arranged between the Government and the Company,During the period at the end of which the Company will be required to select the areas for which the lease shall be granted the company will be ^iven the 30le right to prospect for oil in Jieeopotamia on condition that they make a geological survey of any portion of the country examined by them which shall be placed at the disposal of the Keeopotamian Government. Kis Kaje0ty&apos;s Government would advise the Arab Government to throw open for development by other oil interests all other areas in Mesopotamia outside the areas ultimately selected by the companies.   They would also advise the Arab Government to require the Turkish petroleum Company to become general carriers of oil produced by other oil interests in the event of a pipe line being constructed from Mesopotamia to the Mediterranean,!This formula has been concurred in by the Petroleum Department and I aiu not sure that a Cabinet discussion is really necessary, but if you think it would be better I hope that you will be able io arrange it at a very early flate as I do not think that our representative on the Council of the League of Mations ou$at to be unprepared With an answer to possible enquiries on this important point.Yours truly, (Sgd.)   viusTOIT S.

3* flow of letter dated June 23rd. 1921 from Sir LaurioeHankey to lir.7^urohlll.iDear       Churchill.Many thanks for your letter of June 20th, regarding ^esopotaraian olltIn that letter you deal with two aspects of the question:-?irst - the question of whether the development should be carried out by the British Government directly, or by arrangement with private companies, which you point out has practically been decided by the otcrrespondence which has passed between the foreign.^n Offioe and the United States Crovernmentj and second * the instructions to he given to the British representative on the Council of the league of Nations in regard to the policy of H.K. Government in their capacity as Adviser to the Arab Government of the future on this subject.As this is a matter in which the Prime Eini*?ter has taken a personal interestt 1 think it will be necessary to circulate something to the Cabinet en the subject.   If you approve, I would surest merely circulating the present correspondence.   You may prefer, however, to have a memorandum prepared departmentfllly, covering the same ground, and to circulate that to the Cabinet.After the material has been circulated I will tako, the Prime Kiulster1s instructions a3 to whether he feels thr,t he can approve the matter himself, subject to the concurrence of the Departments affected, or whether he would lil:e a discussion vdth the Cabinet on the suhject.In the meanwhile I am forwarding a copy of this correspondence to It. Richer at Geneva to show him how.the matter stands.Yours sincerely, (3 d.)   K.P.A. ILCK2Y.
