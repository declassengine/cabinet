PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.....The Prime Ministers invitation of the 25th May to the two parties to the coal mining dispute to meet him in joint conference proved acceptable, and the conference accordingly took place on the 27th. On the following day, detailed proposals towards a settlement were communicated separately to the two sides. The miners&apos; decision on the proposals will be arrived at on the 3rd June by their executive, and not by a special session of the National Delegate Conference.  The owners&apos; views will be known about the same time.An equally important development of the week has been the official suspension of the sympathetic movement in support of the miners amongst railwaymen and transport workers. Both these bodies have troubles of their own ahead. The failure to secure agreed terms of reference between the negotiating Committee of Railway Managers and the Amalgamated Engineering Union, with regard to the submission of the claims of railway shopmen to the Industrial Court, has a direct effect upon the submission to the Court of the claim of the National Union of Railwaymen on behalf of their shopmen members, while a proposal for a national reduction in the minimum wage of dockers, as fixed last year by Lord Shaw&apos;s Court of Inquiry is foreshadowed. It is significant, however, that the first step toward a frank suspension of the sympathetic movement was taken in their annual conference by the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen.The National Transport Workers&apos; Federation are also concerned with the strike of ships&apos; cooks and stewards, in connection with which the Ministry are approaching the employers on behalf of the Federation, and with the general position of road transport workers, with regard to which a joint conference has been arranged to take place on the 3rd June at Montagu House between the National Road Transport Federation and the transport workers.Sir David Shackleton met the employers in the engineering trades on the 24th May, and representatives of the trade unions, for a second time, on the 31st, and a joint meeting has been arranged between the two sides for the 3rd June. The resumption of work on the 23rd May, by various groups of members of the Electrical Trades Union who were on strike, on the instructions of the delegate conference of the union, appears to have been complete, with the exception of some 120 members who are still on strike at Aberdeen.An account is given below of the general position in the building trades, following upon the putting into operation of the recently agreed national reduction. The main cause of the trouble appears to have been the application of the reduction to plumbers and painters. On the other hand, the difficulties anticipated in non-federated areas appear largely to have been avoided.The position. with regard, to both the cotton and wool textile industries is critical. The notices in the cotton industry expire on the 4th June, while the employers in the wool textile trades apparently intend their proposed new agreement to operate from the 11th June. The furnishing trades have also entered the group of industries in which wages reductions are taking place in all parts of the country.The Unemployment Position.Statistics-On the 20th May, in the United Kingdom, 2,037,217 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts,&apos; and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,494,170 were lodged by males and 543,047 by females. At the same date 1,181, 078 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 600,583 were lodged by males and 580,495 by females.These figures show an increase on the previous&apos; week of 86,143 totally unemployed and 48,808 working short time.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 27th May was 2,126,800. The above are advanced figures provided by the Employment Department and are subject to revision.A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on &quot;page 472.
FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Sympathetic Action by Trade Unions in Support of the Miners. At a joint meeting of the executive committees of the National Union of Railwaymen and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, held on the 31st May, it was decided that the emhargo on foreign and other coal should be totally removed. A similar decision had already been arrived at by the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen at their annual con-ference on the 26th May, and, from assurances reported to have been received by this society from the Minister of Transport and the Railway Managers&apos; Committee, it would appear that all railwaymen who have been suspended as a result of their refusal to handle coal will be reinstated at once.* Apart from this decision, there has been very little development in the situation ; the dockers on strike at Aberdeen and Leith have returned to work, and negotiations have been opened between the dockers&apos; union officials and the Glasgow shipowners with a view to settling the strike in Glasgow.Financial assistance is still being given to the miners by various trade unions and the co-operative societies, and at the annual conference of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades it was decided to assist the miners in obtaining extension of credits, particularly in respect of food.Fair Wages Advisory Committee.-At a meeting of this committee on the 26th May, a number of matters of general importance were dealt with.The committee considered the position of Government departments with regard to . trades in which a dispute existed as a result of the employers seeking to enforce reductions against their workpeople. It was decided that departments should not immediately apply a rate of wages which one side was seeking to enforce and the other side was challeng-ing, but that rates should be continued without alteration, until they had been settled by agreement or might be regarded as being generally operative.The question was raised whether in view of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, it was desirable to omit the reference to the House of Commons from the Fair Wages Clause in contracts placed in Ireland. The Committee decided that no change need be made at present.Washington International Labour Conference, 1919. In the House of Commons, on the 27th May, a discussion took place on the policy which should be pursued by the Govern-ment towards the Draft Conventions adopted by the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation at their first session, at Washington, in November, 1919. The discussion arose on a motion by Mr. G. Barnes in the following terms : &quot; That in the opinion of this House the Conventions adopted at the International Labour Conference under the League of Nations should be submitted to Parliament as the competent authority.&quot;The Minister of Labour, following Mr. Barnes, moved as an amendment, to leave out from the word kC House &quot; to the end of the Question, and to add the following words : &quot; It is not expedient in existing circumstances to proceed with legislation to give effect to the Washington Convention on Hours of Labour.&quot;The main debate, therefore, took place on the question &quot; that the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Question.&quot; The Ministers amendment was carried by 109 votes to 69, but proceedings upon the Question as amended were interrupted under Standing Order 1 (3). Further discussion may take place, therefore, upon the desirability of proceeding with legislation to give effect to the Hours Convention.The principal point which was urged upon the Government in the course of the debate was that the Government were under an obligation, before deciding upon questions of ratification, to submit the Draft Conventions to Parliament for discussion;&quot; or, in effect, that both Houses of Parliament should be associated with the Government as &quot; competent.(b 17384T)* See p. 465 below.3N2
Features of the Week-continued.authorities &quot; upon such questions.* Labour members also urged that the Government were under a special obligation with regard to the Hours Convention, in that the Govern-ment representatives at the Washington Conference voted in favour of the Convention. Mr. A. Henderson, in particular, raised the whole question of hours legislation, as it arises from the National Industrial Conference of 1919, as well as from the Washington Draft Convention.With regard to the procedure to be followed under Article 19 of the Labour Part of the Treaties of Peace,* the case of the Government was explained by the Attorney-General. In this country, the authority for the ratification of Conventions was the Crown. It was only when the convention actually required legislation that ratification was postponed until Parliamentary sanction had been asked and obtained; but even then it was not the Parliamentary sanction which ratified the Convention. It was not quite accurate to say that the Washington Conventions had not been submitted to Parliament; they were laid last year as a Command Paper before both Houses.The Minister of Labour reviewed the action which the Government had decided to take as regards each of the Draft Conventions and Recommendations adopted at Washington. He dealt in particular with the Hours Convention, and explained the difficulties which pre-vented the incorporation of the provisions of this Convention into the British code of industrial legislation. The working conditions of railwaymen, for example, were governed by agreements under which they had a guaranteed day and a guaranteed 48-hour week, apart, however, from Sunday duty. The adoption of the Convention would make it necessary to interfere with those agreements by legislation, and the railway trade unions and companies, and the Minister of Transport, were agreed that the terms of the Convention were not applicable to our railway system. Secondly, there was the question of overtime. The tendency at present was to reduce overtime throughout ail industries, but it was the opinion of the Government that the limitation of overtime could be carried out by industrial agreements within the various industries more easily than by the method of departmental regulation. Thirdly, there was the question of seamen&apos;s hours, which had been left over from Washington to be dealt with at Genoa, and which was still outstanding. This last was a further practical difficulty in framing an Hours of Employment Bill.With regard to future policy, the Minister made the following statement: &quot; After careful consideration, we have come to the conclusion that in certain respects the detailed provisions of that Convention would not he appropriate to conditions in this country. However, having regard to the fact that in most industries in this country there is already, by agree-ment between employers and employed, a week of 48 hours or less, the Government would be pre-pared, when the opportunities of framing industrial legislation are improved by a return to normal conditions, to co-operate with the other nations who are parties to the International Labour Organi-sation, in preparing another Convention on the same subject.&quot;Sir Montague Barlow, in answer to a question by Mr. A. Henderson, stated that it was not the intention of the Government to drop the Hours of Employment Bill altogether, and expressed the hope that the Provisional Joint Committee of the National Industrial Conference would continue in session. The Minister promised that an opportunity should be given for a fuller discussion of the reasons which had led the Government to determine not to ratify the Hours and Maternity Conventions.Industrial and Other Organisations.Trade Union Conferences. The annual conference of the Railway Clerks&apos; Association was held at Bournemouth from the 23rd to the 26th May. As stated in last week&apos;s issue of this Report, one of the most important subjects discussed was the Railways Bill, and its probable effects on the conditions of service of members of the association. The question of amalgamation with other railway trade unions was also discussed, and the decision was against fusion, but a recommendation was made in favour of the establishment of an entente between the unions concerned, with full autonomy for each organisation. Other resolutions recommending all branches to affiliate with the Labour Party, and protesting against &quot; the attack on freedom of speech &quot; under the Emergency Powers Act, were adopted ; and the executive council were instructed to consider the advisability of officials of the association vacating their positions on election to Parliament, as well as the setting up of a series of tests on economic and political questions for Parliamentary candidates.* The relevant words in the Treaties of Peace are as follows : &quot; Each of the Members undertakes that it will . . . bring the recommendation or draft convention before the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies, for the enactment of legislation or other action.&quot; (Article 19 of the Labour Part of the Treaties of Peace.)
Features of the Week-Continued.The annual conference of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and J Firemen opened at Leeds on the 25th May. The question of the action to he taken on behalf of those members of the society who have been suspended as a result of their refusal to handle &quot; blackleg &quot; coal was fully discussed, and it was agreed that a deputation should visit the Minister of Transport and the Railway Managers&apos; Committee. The deputation were informed that all coal arriving at the ports was taken over by the Government, and used only for services essential to life, and not for any industrial profit-making concerns; more-over, all suspended members would be allowed to return to work without further penalty or record against them. The conference, on being advised of these facts, passed a resolution instructing their members&apos;&apos; to resume duty at once with a view to removing any railway difficulty from standing in the way of the miners making a settlement during the negotia-tions.&quot; Various questions concerning conditions of work and unemployment were also discussed; and it was decided that the executive committee should make arrangements for the removal of the society&apos;s general office from Leeds to London.On the 25th May, the annual conference of the United Vehicle Workers opened at Sheffield. Mr. Edwin Plinston, of Warrington, was re-elected president. A resolution expressing sympathy with the miners in their present straggle was adopted. As a result of the ballot on the question of amalgamation with other unions catering for transport and general workers,* there were 65,400 votes for amalgamation, and 5,400 votes against. A resolution recommending withdrawal from the Amsterdam International of Trade Unions and affiliation with the International Council of Trade and Industrial Unions (Moscow) was defeated by 108 votes to 83. There was considerable discussion on the question whether officials of the union who became Freemasons should be compelled to resign from their positions in the union, and a resolution in favour of this proposal was carried by a large majority. A resolution was also adopted advocating the endowment of a scholarship in a Labour College, to be open to members by competition. A vote of censure was passed on those members who took part in the recent raid on the union&apos;s headquarters in London.The Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades opened their annual conference at Scarborough on the 26th May. The training of apprentices, and the efforts now being made to reduce their wages, were discussed; and it was decided to press for their wages to be dealt with from a national standpoint, in the same manner as the ordinary worker&apos;s wages. The question of a general reduction in wages was also discussed, and it was decided to ask the Minister of Labour for an inquiry into the present position of the industry. It was also decided to recommend each affiliated trade union to give immediate financial help to the miners, and to assist them in obtaining extension of credits, particularly in respect of food. The National Union of Stove, Grate, Fender, and General Light Metal Workers and the Birmingham Operative Tinplate, Sheet Metal Workers and Braziers&apos; Society, were admitted as members of the Federation.National Chamber of Trade. At a conference of the National Chamber of Trade held at Cheltenham on the 24th May, a letter from the Minister of Labour, outlining the Ministry&apos;s policy with regard to the extension of Trade Boards was discussed. A. resolution was passed welcoming the decision of the Minister to &quot; proceed with caution &quot; in the establish-ment of new Trade Boards, and urging an inquiry into the general effect of the existing Boards on trade, and their cost to the State.Among other resolutions adopted by the conference was one declaring that, in view of the harm caused by recent strikes, the Government should be called upon to consider the urgent necessity for legislation whereby the trade and commerce of the country may be protected against interruption until steps have been taken to settle disputes by other means; and it was decided that the Governments attention should he drawn to the alleged efficacy of the Canadian Industrial Disputes (Investigation) Act of 1907..NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Cotton Textile Workers (National). On the 25th May a meeting of operatives&apos; delegates representing all sections of the industry, including weavers, was held in Manchester, when it was agreed that the workpeople&apos;s organisations should act together as a joint body,* See this Eeport, Vol. Ill, No. 21, 21st May, p. 434.
Negotiations and Disputes--continued.and approach the employers with a view to resuming negotiations on the proposed wages reductions.* As a result, a joint conference was held on the 27th May between the Master Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers&apos; Association, the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations, Ltd., and the operatives. At this-conference, a committee consisting of eight representatives of employers and eight representatives of workpeople was appointed to conduct negotiations, and the meeting was adjourned until the 31st May. It was agreed that notices should terminate on the 4th June in the event of no settlement being reached.It is understood that the committee met on the 31st May in Manchester as arranged, and adjourned until the 1st June.Boot and Shoe Operatives-At a meeting of representatives of the Boot and Shoe Manufacturers&apos; Federation and the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives on the 24th May, it was decided that the rate of wages laid down in the National Agreement, which terminated on the 31st March, should remain in force during the next six months. In the meantime, each side is to prepare revised schemes for submission to a joint conference.Strikes and Lock-Outs.&apos; Coal Miners (Nationalj-^ith a view to settling&apos;this dispute, the Prime Minister met representatives of the Mining Association and the Miners&apos; Federation on the 27th and 28th May. Pending a permanent scheme, a temporary arrangement was proposed for gradually scaling down wages until they reach the economic level which the industry is capable of sustaining. To meet the deficiency which would occur during this temporary period, the Government are prepared to make a grant of  10,000,000, and the owners will surrender their &quot; standard profits &quot;for three months in the districts in which Government aid is required. The Government grant will not be given until arrangements for a permanent scheme by one of the three following methods have been arrived at: (1) A National Wages Board shall be set up composed of equal numbers of representatives - of the coal owners and miners, over which a neutral chairman with a casting vote should preside. (2) A tribunal of three persons shall be established to decide the matters at issue. . (3) The question in dispute shall be referred to a single arbitrator.The decision of the body or person selected should be binding upon both parties for a period of twelve months, and thereafter subject to three months&apos; notice upon either side. The determining body shall decide :  1   &quot;(a) The wage to be paid at the end of the temporary period.In arriving at a decision upon this question regard should be had to the capacity of the industry :  in each district,to pay; the provision of a subsistence wage to the lowest paid worker; and the possibilities of increasing output. -      . .. ,:(&amp;) The amount of the minimum standard wage in each district.(c) The proportion of profits to wages in the distribution of the proceeds of the industry.The determining body must report within two months.   .. The Mining Association have decided to refer these proposals to the districts; and.it is.expected that the Central Committee of the Association will meet again on the 1st June to: consider the views expressed..The Executive Committee of the Miners&apos; Federation also decided to lay the proposals before the districts, -and will meet again on the 3rd June to consider the replies received.. FufnisMng Trade Operatives (Liverpool).--A conference recently took place between employers in the wholesale furnishing trade and the Amalgamated Union of Upholsterers, at which the employers proposed a reduction in wages of 2d. per hour. The Union declined to agree to the proposal, and, as a result, some 60 male and female upholsterers ceased work on the 21st May.f ;Settlements and Agreements,Builders (National), The ballot of the operatives in connection with the new wages scale proposed by the National Wages and Conditions Council for the Building Trades^ has resulted in a majority for acceptance of the proposals, and the agreement has generally been put into operation. In Scotland, districts where employers were not paying the graded rates under the Scottish grading scheme of the 8th November; 1920;* See ibis Report, Vol/III, No. 21, &apos;21st May, pp. 435 and 436. - f At Nottingham, the operatives have also refused to agree to the proposed reduction of 2d. per hour: The-position-at Birmingham is dealt with on p. 467 below. $ See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 20,14th May, p. 416.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued,are not regarded by the operatives as being affected by the decision of the National Wages and Conditions Council, and, accordingly, any attempt to impose a reduction in wages that will bring the operatives&apos; wages below the amount which would be allowed if the employers had accepted the grading scheme will be opposed. Local agreements have been concluded in Arbroath, Montrose and Carnoustie.At Birmingham, the proposed reductions have/been accepted without trouble in the federated districts. In the more important non-federated districts, where, at one time, trouble was threatened, the reductions have been arranged with little difficulty.At Norwich, the painters&apos; dispute, which began in consequence of a notice of a reduction in wages issued by the Norwich Painters and Decorators&apos; Association, ended on the 17th May, the employers having agreed to put into operation the recommendation of the National Wages and Conditions Council.At Dover, negotiations were commenced between the master builders&apos; association and the operatives early in May on the subject of wages reductions. The negotiations were adjourned, however, pending the decision of the National Wages and Conditions Council. When this decision was published the employers decided to give notice of a reduction as from the 16th May of 2d. per hour (the amount agreed upon by the Council) in all operatives&apos; wages except those of painters, whose rate was to be reduced 3d. per hour. To this the painters would not agree, and 60 men ceased work on the 17th May. In consequence of this dispute, and after an appeal by the painters to their headquarters at Manchester, instructions were given to the other operatives at Dover to strike in support of the painters, and, accordingly, 200 more men ceased work on the 21st May.*At Bradford, 300 plumbers employed by members of the West Riding Federation of Master Plumbers&apos; Associations ceased work on the 18th May as a protest against the proposed reductions, although these reductions have been accepted in the neighbouring towns. The Bradford operatives, however, contend that their representatives at the meeting of the Council did not agree to the reductions.Wire Workers (Scotland). The Scottish Wire Work Manufacturers&apos; Association have reached an agreement with the Scottish Friendly Society for wire workers to reduce wages \\d. per hour for time-workers, and 15 per cent, for pieceworkers, making the new time rate, as from the 27th May, Is. lOd per hour. The agreement is binding until the 30th September, 1921, and provides for a joint conference in the first week of September to discuss further wage adjustments..Tape Weavers (Midlands)-The Midland Tape Manufacturers&apos; Association and the National Union of General Workers have come to an agreement for a reduction of 20 per cent, in the wages of tape weavers. The association were previously paying wages on the standard price-list adopted in August, 1919, to which a bonus of 40 per cent, was added in April, 1920.Furnishing Trade (Birmingham). Negotiations have been concluded between the Birmingham and District Furnishing Manufacturers&apos; Association and the Birmingham Manufacturers&apos; and Allied Trades Association, and the Birmingham Furnishing Trades&apos; Federated Committee, resulting in an agreement for a reduction of wages of 2\d. per hour for adult male time-workers, \\d. per hour for adult female French polishers and uphol-stresses, and 10 per cent, on aggregate piece-work earnings. Proportionate reductions are to be made in the case of younger workers. The amended rates become operative from the last working week in June, and are payable on the first pay-day in July.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Departments section of the Report, pages 468 to 470.]* See also p. 468 belqw.
PART IL-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.Engineering Industry. Representatives of the Management Committee of the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations met Sir David Shackleton on the 24th May, and discussed the breakdown of the negotiations regarding reductions in wages. They considered that a reduction was essential and declined to entertain the proposal to refer the matter to arbitration.Railway Shopmen. At the request of the Negotiating Committee of General Managers, the department have been endeavouring for some time past to arrange for arbitration by the Industrial Court on the rates of wages and conditions of employment of railway shopmen. The National Union of Railwaymen, with whom are associated the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives, the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, and the National Federation of General Workers, agreed to be made parties to the projected arbitration, and terms of reference were agreed with the Negotiating Com-mittee of General Managers. A difference regarding the scope of the terms of reference has arisen between the Negotiating Committee of General Managers and the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the committee deeming it essential that the terms of reference should apply to all men employed in or about railway shops in every district, while the union are unwilling to submit for review by the Court the question of the rates and conditions in shops where their members are already in receipt of rates higher than the district rate.In view of this difference the department have been unable to arrange for arbitration proceedings which would include all the parties concerned, and in the circumstances the Negotiating Committee have informed the department they consider it impracticable to proceed with the arbitration. This decision has been communicated to the unions concerned.BUILDING AND WORKS OF CONSTRUCTION.Painters (Folkestone). On the 14th May the master builders at Folkestone gave notice, in accordance with the National Agreement, for a reduction of 2d. per hour in the wages of all operatives except painters, to become effective from the 16th May. The painters&apos; wages were to be reduced by 3d an hour, contrary to the terms of the agreement. The painters would not accept this reduction, and 160 ceased work on the 18th May. The Chief Conciliation Officer intervened, and the master builders agreed to abide by the agreement, and reduce the painters&apos; wages by 2d. an hour only. Work was resumed on the 20th May.MINING AND QUARRYING.Artificial Stone. At a meeting of the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee, on the 20th May, it was unanimously agreed that wages should be reduced by the amount of the last advance, made.in October, 1920, namely, l\d. per hour. The new minimum rates, Is. 5\d. per hour for labourers and Is. 6d5. for finishers, will come into operation on the first full pay in June. A sub-committee of two members from each side was appointed to draw up a scheme for the future regulation of wages..TRANSPORT.Ships&apos; Steivards.-The secretary of the National Union of Ships&apos; Stewards, Cooks, Butchers and Bakers was interviewed at headquarters by the Chief Labour Adviser on the 26th May, and efforts are being made to interview representatives of the employers.A report in the Press states that at a mass meeting of the cooks and stewards at Liverpool on the 29th May, the men&apos;s determination to continue the stoppage was reaffirmed. In spite of this it would appear that ships are still sailing from the various ports.
Industrial Relations Department-continued.POTTERY, RUBBER AND MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.Pottery. A meeting of the Research, Inventions and Designs Committee of the Joint Industrial Council was held on the 25th May, when Dr. Eichholz, of the Medical Department of the Board of Education, attended. He had previously written to the Council for information on the problem of industrial conditions in regard to their effect on young persons. The Council had issued a questionnaire to all members of the Pottery Federation, regarding the steps taken to determine the applicant^ fitness, to select work suited to the worker&apos;s physical condition, and to make medical provision for the detection, observation and treatment of physical defects. Inquiry was also made as to the provision for adolescent workers in regard to canteen facilities, baths, rest and physical training. The replies generally were of a negative nature.Dr. Eichholz remarked that he came to the Council for information, but urged, in the interests of all concerned, the protection of young life, and quoted a scheme in operation in the works of Messrs. T. De La Rue &amp; Co., Ltd., London. The chairman promised the support and assistance of the committee in putting into operation the principles outlined.In connection with welfare, the National Council have adopted, and the British Pottery Manufacturers&apos; Association have accepted, provisions which include arrangements for preparing and taking meals, the supply of drinking water, the purchase of protective clothing at cheap rates by the operatives, ambulance work, first aid, seats in workrooms where desired, facilities for washing and accommodation for clothing.Glass Workers. A dispute arising out of an agreement made between the United (Machine) Glass Bottle Makers&apos; Society and the National Glass Workers&apos; Trade Protection Association in September, 1920, was referred to the arbitration of Mr. Mallalieu, at the instance of the Chief Conciliation Officer, Leeds. The question in dispute was whether the National Association were justified in taking over the Hayes Branch of the United (Machine) Glass Bottle Makers&apos; Society en bloc, together with the branch funds.On the first point of disagreement, whether a clause recommending that any member could transfer into either society could be interpreted to apply to a whole branch, Mr. Mallalieu held that such an interpretation was quite in accordance with the terms of the agreement. On the second point, whether the funds of any branch transferred in accordance with the above ruling could be taken over by the union to which members transferred, Mr. Mallalieu held that this was not in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Mr. Mallalieu&apos;s ruling has been accepted by both societies, as far as the transfer of members is concerned, but the National Glass Workers&apos; Trade Protection Association object to his award on the second point, and are in correspondence with him . oh the subject.Glaziers (Belfast). Two agreements, negotiated by an officer of the Irish Department, between the Belfast Glass Merchants&apos; Association on the one hand, and the National Union of Glass Workers of the United Kingdom, Belfast Branch, and the Belfast Glaziers&apos; Society, on the other, provide that the rates of wages should be the same as that of the skilled tradesmen in the Belfast building trade, and that, pending a settlement of the building trade strike at present in progress, a rate of 2s. per hour should be paid. In the event of a rate in excess of 2s. per hour being fixed for the building trade, the question of retrospective payment of such excess is to be discussed by a committee representative of both employers and workpeople. If the rate proves to be below 2s. the agreement provides for a refund by the union workers of the excess wages which they have received.Furniture Warehousing and Removing. Representations have been made to the department from time to time by the Furniture Warehousemen and Removers&apos; Asso-ciation, and by the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee, that the scope of the Committee should be extended to cover the furnishing trade. In connection with this proposal a deputation of representatives of the House Furnishers&apos; Association and the Furniture Warehousemen and Removers&apos; Association were interviewed at headquarters on the 26th May. They stated that in large towns no difficulty arose, but in smaller towns furniture removing and house furnishing were often carried on by a firm with the same class of employees. It was difficult to separate the staff in such instances, and, if a Trade Board rate were established for the distributive side of the furniture trade, this rate would have to be extended to other employees not engaged in the distribution or sale of furniture. They desired to know how the Ministry would advise them to meet such a situation.. The deputation were informed that it was the policy of the department to leave it to a trade, to settle its own difficulties of this character. They were given assurances that,(b 17384t) 3 0
Industrial Relations Department-continued. ^while the trade was working under a voluntary agreement as to wages, and there was no evidence that this agreement was not national, or was failing to work successfully, the Minister had no power to set up a Trade Board. If at any time it was thought desirable or necessary to set up a Board, their association, with other bodies, would be fully advised and consulted before any definite steps were taken. It was also agreed that neither they. nor the Ministry would take any definite steps towards the extension of the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee, or the establishment of a Trade Board, without joint consultation, and the door was left open should they on any occasion wish to approach the Ministry again regarding the extension of the scope of the Committee. The deputation expressed themselves as well satisfied.TEXTILES.Wool (and Allied) Textiles. A further meeting of the Joint Industrial Council will be held in Bradford on the 30th May to discuss the basis of wages to come into operation on the expiration of the current agreement. The employers&apos; proposals have been considered by the executive committees of the various unions, and the reports of these committees will be submitted to the National Association of Unions in the Textile Trades on the 28th May. It is understood that the association will decide to reject the employers&apos; proposals for. a reduction, but will empower their representatives on the Council to conduct nego-, tiations. The position is somewhat complicated by the fact that any reduction which-may be effected in the manufacturing-dyeing sections of the wool textile industry will re-act upon the wool and cotton commission dyeing industry in Yorkshire and Lancashire, in which the sliding-scale agreement of October, 1919, originally fixed for one year, is being extended from week to week.PROFESSIONAL WORKERS.Entertainments. The Executive Committee of the Industrial Council met on the 24th May. Letters were read from the Theatrical Managers&apos; Association and the Association of Touring Managers, notifying the withdrawal of these bodies from the Council on the ground that it was serving no useful purpose. A letter was also read from the Provincial. Proprietors&apos; and Managers&apos; Association stating that they were holding a special meeting to. consider the position of the Council, and, pending the decision of this meeting, the. association would take no part in the proceedings of the Council.-With reference to the position of the Theatrical Managers&apos; Association and the Association of Touring Managers, it was explained that the Ministry were negotiating with, these bodies, and the committee decided therefore to take no action beyond referring the resignations to the meeting of the full Council on the 1st July. It was agreed in the case of the Provincial Proprietors&apos; and Managers&apos; Association to send a deputation from, the committee to speak in support of the Council at the special meeting of the association.The Chairman said that the trade union side had met the Actors&apos; Association with a view to their rejoining the Council, and the association were now considering an offer of two additional seats on the executive committee. It was agreed to request the Parlia-mentary Committee of the Council to attend a meeting which was being held at the House of Commons by supporters of the Performing Animals Bill, 1921, with a view to giving expression to the opposition to this Bill. .   -,: [Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found-also on pages 462 to 467, 470 to 472, and 476.]GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS.PROCEEDINGS.. Aerated Waters:Trade Board (England and Wales). It was agreed that representations should be made to the Minister in respect of the delay experienced in obtaining decisionsj regarding the recommendations made by the Board in April, 1920, for the extension of&apos; the scope of the Board.. . . &apos;:Brush and Broom Trade Board (Great Britain).

Id., and Is. 5\d. per hour, respectively. It was further resolved to vary the conditions attaching to the minimum rates fixed for male apprentices in the bone-brush section of the trade, by providing that the maximum proportion of apprentices to journeymen shall be 1 to-5 instead of 2 to 5 as hitherto.It was also agreed that the Minister be requested to furnish a reply to a request made by the. Administrative Comnfittee that the Board might be furnished with full monthly reports of investigations made in the trade. A special committee was appointed to investigate certain criticisms made in respect of the general minimum piece-rates fixed for female workers engaged in drawing textile machine brushes.General Waste Materials Reclamation Trade Board (Great Britain). It was resolved to recommend to the Minister that the minimum rates for female workers, already fixed by the Board, should be made effective as soon as possible, and, further, that the Board should immediately refer to a committee the question of reconsidering the minimum rates as fixed by the Board. -        7Hollow-ware Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board resolved to propose certain variations in the minimum ratesdbr female workers, the principal of which is the variation of the general minimum time-rate for female workers, 18 years of age or over, from 34s. 3d. per week of 47 hours to Sd. per hour. Appropriate reductions were also proposed in the general minimum time-rates for younger workers. The Board further resolved to fix a piece-work basis time-rate for female piece-workers, 18 years of age or over, of 9d. per hour.Laundry Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board considered a letter from the Ministry with regard to the minimum rates for female workers which were re-affirmed by the Board at their meeting held on the 20th and the 21st April, and resolved to exclude from the operation of such rates all workers employed in laundries in the Administrative County of Cornwall and in the Orkney and Shetland Islands.y It was agreed that a resolution should be forwarded to the Minister urging that the scope of the Board should be amended at the earliest possible moment, so as to include laundries connected with shipping companies, hotels, railways, restaurants and other businesses and public institutions, where the workers are under a contract, of service, and that, pending such amendment, the opinions on scope expressed by the ^Minister should be accepted under protest. :&apos; The Board agreed to recommend that the mending of articles which had been damaged during the process of laundering comes within the scope of the Board, and to inform the Minister that in their opinion the scope of the Board, should be extended so as to include clerks who may be employed in the trade.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Button-making Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 23rd May, to vary general minimum time-rates, piece-work. basis time-rates and overtime rates for male and female workers other than homeworkers.. The proposed general minimum time-rates are .:-(1) For male workers employed in stamping, burnishing, spinning, dipping, staining, sawing, turning or cutting, other than cutting on wet lathes, 21 years of age and over, with not less than 2 years&apos; experience in one or more of these operations Is. 3fcZ. per hour; for those with not less than 1 but less than 2 years&apos; experience in one or more of these operations Is. 3$. per hour ; and for those with less than 1 year&apos;s experience in one or more of these operations, Is. 2d. per hour ; (2) for all other male workers, 21 years of age and over, Is. 1^. per hour; and (3) for female workers, 18 years of age and over, l\d. per hour; with lower rates for younger workers in each case.The proposed piece-work basis time-rate for those workers referred to in section (1) of the preceding paragraph is Is. l\d. per hour, and for female workers other than home-workers, 8%d. perhour. - .......    . .   &apos;i &apos;. s Overtime rates are proposed for male and female workers employed on time-work and femaleworkers employed on piece-work, and, in this connection, the Board propose to declare the normal number of hours of work in the trade to be 48 in any week and 5 on Saturday.Hat, Cap and Millinery Trade Board (Ireland).-The Minister has made an Order, elated-the 17th May, confirming general minimum time-rates, piece-work basis time-rates(b 17384t) : 3 0 2

The general situation is unchanged. Unemployment and under-employment continue to increase, and no improvement can be expected until the coal dispute has been settled.Men&apos;s Employment.Iron and Steel. Throughout the country the effects of the lack of fuel and materials owing to the coal dispute become daily more apparent. At Smethwick and Derby reductions of staff have taken place; at the same time., a large number of orders are ready for execution as soon as the coal crisis is settled, and, in this respect at least, industrial prospects are bright.Messrs. had fields, Ltd., Attercliffe, have put off another 300 workpeople, but will restart the whole of their works upon the receipt of coal supplies. At Barnsley the industry is now practically at a standstill, while at Otley all workpeople could resume full time if coal supplies were available. Messrs. Marshall, Sons &amp; Co., Ltd., Gainsborough, who are at present closed down, anticipate a resumption if an expected supply of coke is delivered during the week-end.In the Northern, North-Western and Scotland divisions the situation shows no improvement. Many of the larger firms have suspended more workmen.Shipbuilding and Allied Trades. Beports from some of the centres of this industry indicate that the very heavy depression due to the coal dispute is augmented by the shipwrights&apos; and joiners&apos; strikes. At Liverpool, however, trade is reported to be improving daily in the ship-repairing trade, and labour is being gradually absorbed into the variousGeneral Department-continued.and overtime rates for a certain class of female workers as fixed by the Board, and has specified the 23rd May as the date from which these rates are effective.Tobacco Trade Board (Great Britain).--The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 25th May, to fix and/or vary general minimum piece-rates and overtime rates for male and female apprentices in the cigar section of the trade.The proposed general minimum time-rates are those for workers of the same age and sex set out in the Board&apos;s notice dated the 17th July, 1920,For the purpose of overtime rates the Board have declared the normal number of hours of work in the trade to be 48 in any week, 9 on any week-day other than Saturday, and 5 on Saturday.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Trade Boards will also be found on -pages 465, 469 and 470.]
Employment and Insurance Department-continued^departments. This is due to the fact that shipowners are now seriously turning their attention to the conversion of coal-burning vessels into oil-burners. On the Tyne, Tees and Wear there is no visible improvement except at Hartlepool, where the Irvine Ship-building Co., Ltd., have engaged 200 men for repair work. In Sunderland the shortage of steel plates is preventing the employment of large numbers of men; At Willington Quay Messrs. J. T. Eltringham &amp; Co., Ltd., are closing down about the first week in June, when 450 men and boys, at present on short time, will become unemployed. Many firms who expected to resume work on the 23rd May have been unable to do so, owing to the shortage of coal and other materials.In Leith a fair number of men have obtained employment on minor repair work, and throughout the country generally good business is anticipated upon a settlement of the coal dispute.Textiles and Clothing. The entire industry is now very seriously affected. No appreci-able movement appears to have followed on the introduction of oil fuel in some of the mills, the general argument against the installation of oil engines being the large expense involved. There is evidence, however, that there will be a considerable revival as soon as supplies of coal are forthcoming.In the boot and shoe trade, although considerable anxiety is occasioned by the lack of fuel, reports indicate that a satisfactory amount of work is in hand,, and short time working will be necessary only so long as the coal crisis lasts. Many large firms are working three and four days per week regularly.Miscellaneous Trades. From all parts a shortage of plasterers and bricklayers is reported, but no improvement in other trades or industries is indicated except in a few isolated cases. The severe depression in the chemical and dyestuffs trades continues. In the glass and porcelain trades, complete stagnation is approaching, and it is feared that unless fuel is shortly obtained the glass trade will be brought to a complete standstill, which would probably last several months before work could be resumed. The pottery trade is completely paralysed, and the only employees now working are those engaged on maintenance work. ,: .   .: ,Short-time working is increasing in the various departments of all railway companies.In the Metropolitan area no improvement in the general situation is reported. .; ,Women&apos;s Employment. /    .,Local Reports. The North-Western Division report that unemployment, and: in a greater degree under-employment, prevail in all industries. Advantage has been taken of the Whitsuntide recess to close down many of the cotton mills, indefinitely or for extended holidays, owing to lack of coal.. The majority of.spinners and manufacturers are being compelled to restrict activity just at a time when orders and inquiries would justify the resumption of full-time working. ..Depressed reports continue to be received from the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division. Serious unemployment and under-employment are reported from the textile centres, and are especially marked in the woollen trade. There is no improvement in the lace-making trade, and other workers affected by the general depression are hosiery workers, clothing machinists, boot operatives, leather workers, glass and earthenware workers, rubber and chemical workers, paper makers and metal workers. &quot;Fish-house workers and net-braiders remain unemployed at Grimsby and Hull.At Pontefract a large firm of liquorice makers have closed, down indefinitely;    &apos;;&quot;The South.Midlands and Eastern Division state that the paralysis of trade is hkixig increased by fuel shortage. The clothing, boot and shoe, leather, hosiery, silk and elastic web industries are all affected. At Colchester, however, a steady improvenient in the clothing trade is reported, and is only retarded by the coal stoppage. At Leicester the boot trade also shows some improvement, but is hampered in the same manner. (.In the London and South-Eastern Division the coal shortage is being felt1 in, the paper-making and engineering industries, and the general trade depression&apos;which-has now prevailed for many months continues. General clerks and unskilled factory workers are swelling the registers of the Exchanges throughout the division, the former on account of substitution by ex-Service men. Dressmakers and tailoresses are unemployed in many areas, but a scarcity of tailoresses is reported in the City, and many are reported to have resumed work in Whitechapel. Many tinplate workers are unemployed at- Camber well and in other areas. Shop assistants are feeling the general trade depression in many London suburban areas.  The theatres are also feeling the general depression; at the
Employment and Insurance Department-cow^weel-Gr^atMarlborougbStreet Exchange 86 chorus girls are signing for, benefit, and the Exchange have no prospect of securing them employment.  Many other trades are also affected, including printing, bookbinding, rubber work, and jam manufacture.In the West Midlands Division many more factories are expected to close down during the week unless further supplies of coal are forthcoming. All metal and engineering trades, and also the pottery industry, show acute depression. Other industries affected are rubber Avork, the needle and fishing tackle industry, button making, glass manu-facture and tape weaving. At Selly Oak practically the whole of the employees of Messrs. Cadbury Bros., Ltd., have been suspended; on one day 1,200 women and girls were affected.       .In the South-Western Division the clothing trade shows improvement at Devonport, and some tailoresses have resumed work at Gosport. Longer hours are being worked in the clothing trade at Basingstoke, but at Swindon 100 factory tailoresses have been discharged. A cigar factory at Bristol has reopened, 200 women having resumed work, and it is hoped that a further .100 will begin next week.The tinplate industry is still adversely affected in Wales, and many tinplate workers are unemployed at Gorseinon, Neath and Swansea.In the Northern Division the coal shortage is having a very depressing effect on many industries, especially rope-making at Gateshead, Sunderland and Wallsend.In Scotland there is a good prospect of considerable improvement in the woollen textile trades, and the paper and printing trades. At present, however, all work is gradually slowing down owing to lack of fuel. Jute workers at Aberdeen would resume if fuel were available, but there is considerable unemployment in this industry at Dundee. The fishing industry is affected by transport difficulties, and the employment of women in fish-houses is accordingly retarded.JUVENILE BRANCH.Centres for &quot;Unemployed Juveniles. In the week ending the 18th May centres were open for unemployed juveniles in four places in England and Wales, eight centres being provided, with. 906 juveniles in attendance. Further centres have been approved by the Board of Education at Croydon and High Wycom.be. One centre has been opened in Ireland, but none as yet in Scotland.As there are no centres in London, the King&apos;s Cross Juvenile Advisory Committee are taking the opportunity given by the review of claims to benefit to urge juveniles to join the evening continuation classes. A fair number have promised to attend.Juvenile Organisations Committees. At the third annual exhibition of theFinsbury Juvenile Organisations Committee a model Juvenile Employment Exchange, arranged by the Office of Works, caused considerable interest. The Exchange was visited by Colonel Archer Shee, M.P., and by a number of parents and social workers.Boys in the Royal Air Force. To give greater publicity to the training scheme inaugurated by the Air Ministry for boys joining as mechanics in the Royal Air Force, the right of nomination for examination has novv been extended to.all Juvenile Em ploy-ment Committees. Hitherto it has been found that the standard of education required for the entrance examination has tended to confine the supply of candidates to boys from central and secondary schools, but it.is thought that a large number of boys from the elementary schools would be capable of passing if, on the advice of Juvenile Employment Committees, they attended suitable classes for 18 months after leaving school. Committees wishing to nominate candidates are reqmred to arrange for a room in which the examination can take place, and to obtain the services of a member of the committee, or some other responsible person, to invigilate. Examinations are held twice yearly, and it is estimated that about 500 boys will be required each half-year.: [Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on pages 462, 469, and 471.]
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND  CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 20th May the department placed 236 candi-dates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known, to have been placed to 55,031. Of these, 7,182 have been placed through the agency of the depart-mentVInterviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 449 ex-Service men and 18 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 20th May was 11,505 ex-Service men and 1,258 civilians. At the same date 824 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the &quot;disposal of the department, 236 having been registered during the week.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Business Training Scheme.-During the week ending the 20th May the department received no applications for training under the scheme. The total number of applications is 3,283, of which 1,859 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 813 cases. At the same date 249 vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 3 having been registered during the week. , .- . Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The department have dealt with a total of 1,213 cases, in 533 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed training in 338 cases, and abandoned training in 45 ; 118 are still in training, and 32 are awaiting training.    ,.TRAINING DEPARTMENT. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex*Service Men,&apos;. : Statistics.--On the 24th May 24,349 men were in training, as against 24,326 on the 17th.May and 24,422 on the 26th April. During the week 455 men were, placed in training. There were 16,426 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 17th May and the 26th April being 16,343 and 16,575. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 32,243, the totals for the 17th May and the 26th April being 31,811 and 30,565.Complete figures have now been received from all divisions, giving the number of men who have terminated their training with maintenance during the period from, the 1st August, 1919. to the end of April, 1921. The total is well over 30,000, and in each of the two chief non-special trades, commercial work, and motor driving and mechanics, over 4,000 terminations have been recorded. Over 1,200 men have passed through wireless telegraphy courses, and nearly 750 have received instruction in diamond cutting and polishing. .&quot;:      - :- -      ^v &quot;-- y      ;-: - .&apos; - -     &apos;   &apos; ,In the special trades by far. the highest figure is shown in the boot and shoe industry, in which the total number of terminations is just under 3,000. High figures are also shown by the tailoring, mechanical engineering, distributive, electrical, carpentry and joinery, watch and clock, and cabinet-making trades, in all of which the totals either exceed or are not very far below 1,000.Training in Sanatoria.-k conference has been held at the Ministry of Pensions with reference to the training of tubercular ex-Service men. The Ministry of Health wish to obtain the technical advice of the department on the general question of training, as, up to the present, it has been found impossible to give any appreciable amount of training in sanatoria.National Trade Advisory Committees : Engineering. A conference between the Com-mittee and representatives of the woodworking trades was held on the 18th May, in regard to a proposal that provision should be made in the Engineering Trade Report for the training of disabled ex-Service men in certain woodworking processes carried on in
Appointments and Training-continued.agricultural engineering establishments. Substantial progress was made, and a further con-ference, at which&apos;it is hoped that representatives of the agricultural engineering employers will be present, is to be held on the 8th June.Local Technical Advisory Committees: Engineering. The inaugural meeting of the Worcester Committee was.held on the 12th May. The meeting was of a satisfactory character, and the committee propose, on the termination of the coal dispute, to use every effort to place the men who are at present training in the Worcester area.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service..&quot;. ... Statistics. Up to the 25th. May, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of: 46,348 apprentices, under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanc-tioned in respect of 44,216 apprentices, employed by 17,589 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 25,252.Progress. An inspection of training carried out in the firm of the Associated Equip-ment Co., Ltd., Walthamstow, disclosed a new course of training for apprentices with this firm. It provides chiefly for an all-round training, three months to be spent in each department, and apprentices now employed will be given this opportunity so far as the remainder of tneir apprenticeship permits.Institutional Training. Local headquarters for the London and South-Eastern area continue to receive applications for technical training, and efforts to obtain the required accommodation are meeting with success. In Scotland, however, it is found extremely difficult to arrange for courses of &quot;training at this period of the year, as in suitable institu-tions the summer vacation begins at the end of June. It is not possible to approve of the enrolment of any more students in existing classes. The Director of the Boyal Tech-nical College/ Glasgow, is willing to do whatever he can to provide accommodation, but is confronted with the difficulty of staffing the classes; instructors have been overworked during the winter and need their full vacation this year.General Training. .Apprenticeship : Building. Joint conferences between employers and operatives have been held at Burton-on-Trent and Wakefield. In both instances the national scheme was recommended to the trade associations for adoption. At Stourbridge, where a joint conference was held at the beginning of March, arrangements have been made for a further meeting on. the 22nd June. The bricklayers have already had the &quot;scheme under discus-sion,- arid have.adopted a favourable attitude towards it. The secretary of the employers&apos; association is giving every assistance to popularise the scheme among employers.;Employers:&apos; and operatives&apos; associations at Carmarthen and Haverfordwest have agreed to convene their members with a view to an explanation of the scheme being given. The Technical Adviser for South Wales has provided local headquarters with a list of secretaries and.associations in his area, and has himself promised to bring the scheme before the various associations in North Wales. .[References to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also le found on. pages 469,-471 and 474.
