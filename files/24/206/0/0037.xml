HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.RET^ 289(29)Copy No.     3 J.CABINET,Food Policy and the Protection of the Consumer, Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1. I Tiras invited by the Cabinet on October 22nd, 1929, to submit proposals for obtaining compulsory powers for dealing with interests which might persist In charging excessive prices In defiance of recommendations of the proposed Consumers&apos; Council,      I remain of opinion that the only satisfactory solution of the problem of food prices is public control and ownership of food concerns, and that the alternative of fixing maximum prices is open to the serious objections which I outlined In my previous memorandum (C.P.278/29).2, I assume that there will be no opportunity to introduce the necessary legislation to give effect to the Cabinet&apos;s decision to establish a Consumers&apos; Council until next year, and I should like to give very careful consideration to any measure po be adopted in order to deal with interests which refuse to act on the recommendations of the Consumers&apos; Council. I suggest therefore that It will be sufficient if, In addition to the announcement which ha3 already been approved by the Cabinet, I were authorised to inform Parliament that we have under consideration the adoption of measures for dealing with trade interests which refuse to accept the views of the Government based on recommendations of the Consumers&apos; Council in regard to the retail prices of commodities reviewed by the Council.3, As I have already stated, further time will be required for the consideration of details of the machinery to be
*) o r*established for carrying out a policy of price fixing.     As I see the problem at present, the procedure would be (1) the Consumers&apos; Council would present a report to me stating that the retail price of a certain commodity was, in their opinion, excessive and giving their recommendations as to what the price should be;    (2) the Board of Trade would consider this report and decide whether the recommendations in it should be accepted by the Government;    (3) the 3oard. of Trade would then communicate these recommendations to the traders concerned and endeavour to arrive at a settlement;    (4) in default of a settlement the Board of Trade would have power by Order to give Immediate effect to their decision, such Order being subsequently laid before both Houses of Parliament.     It would appear to be impracticable to require that no Order by the Board of Trade should take effect before it had been before Parliament for a definite period since Immediate action might be required.     This was the case with the dispute about the retail price of milk for August last, the decision of the London Milk distributors having been communicated to the Pood Gouncil on July 30th.W.G.Board of Trade,October 26th, 1929
