Shis document is the property of his britannic majesty1 s government),SE G RET. .    -COPY NO:C ,P. 510  (29),GAB I N E T c BELLIGERENT RIGHTS.Memorandumby the Lord President of the Council.1,      By direction of the Prime Minister, there has been circulated to us a Report on Maritime Belligerent Rights &amp;        -I See (BcR. 821 prepared by a Sub-Committee of the Committee of cp,304(29). Imperial Defence under the late Government.      I cannothere analyse the  arguments and conclusions of this very-important report     but I believe that a brief summary is sufficient to show that the Report is based on assumptions which the Labour Party and the Labour Government haVo publicly rejected,  and that its conclusions are such as my colleagues could not well accept., at least until the whole subject has been thoroughly considered afresh.I submit that the whole subject should now.be referred to a new Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence for consideration and report.2.      The following summary shows how fundamental are the differences of policy involved.(a) The Report is based on the assumption that -&apos;&apos;it is probable that  :public&quot; wars would be the exception rather than the rule. Belligerent rights, therefore, must be discussed on the assumption that they may be used in &quot;private1&apos; wars,      Such wars may be waged either between individual Powers or between Powers with allies, either where the League of Nations Council has failed to reach agreement or where the members of the League are afraid to declare a Great Power to be the offender&quot;, (34).
(b) The conclusion reached is that it la to our interest     that  &quot;&quot;belligerent slights should he maintained as high as possible&quot; (70)o(c) The Report considers that a Conference on Maritime Belligerent Rights is most undesirable, but may prove unavoidable.      In tho hope of avoiding a Conference,  the Report recommends that wo should make an Arbitration Treaty ostensibly containing no reservation as to belligerent rights., though  (as is shown in the complementary paper, Secret 943-B) in reality enabling us to rofuse arbitration in all disputes to which we may attach special importance, by the old device of the special&apos; oompromis.     The Report further recommends that we should try for an Anglo-American Agreement or modus Vivendi as to naval limitation. If, notwithstanding those measures, a Conference should unfortunately prove unavoidable, wo should try to confine it to the United States and ourselves, or, failing that,to as few Powero as possible,  lest we should be overborne by the public opinion of the world.   (65),(d) Tho Report on Belligerent Rights was complementary to a Report by the same Committee on the Renewal of Arbitration Treaties  (Secret 943-B)o      This Report^ shows that the late Government wholly rejected tho principle of all-inclusive pacific settlement and insisted on maintaining freedom to refuse third party judgment even in justiciable disputes,     They regretted being unable, owing to public opinion, to retain the old &quot;vital interests &apos; reservation in so many words:    but they proposed to attain the same end by making all our Arbitration
Treaties (including presumably the Optional Clause)subject to our acceptance of a special  &quot;compromis&apos;&quot; ineach case.      In other words, they wished to leave usfree in the last resort to refuse arbitration altogether-3.      The Labour Government has been proceeding on exactly the,, opposite assumption.Whereas this Report on Belligerent Rights was based on the assumption that private war was the contingency we had chiefly to consider, the present prime Minister wrote in the preface to tho LabourParty&apos;s pamphlet -Freedom of the Seas&quot; -&quot;if the Kellogg Pact means anything,  it means that there is to be no more war except in so far as nations bound to preserve peace and to settle disputes by other than military means havo to combine to curb a mad dog&quot;0Whereas the late Foreign Secretary likened the&quot;gap in the Covenant&quot; to&quot; a window letting in fresh air,the present Foreign Secretary has called for the closing of tho gap and the complete renunciation of the right ofprivate war j    the League of Nations is now in processof applying this policy,  and we have signed the optional clause. XWhereas the late Government,  arguing from their premises,  concluded, that we-must stand out for the highest possible belligerent rights, the Labour party&apos;s pamphlet put the case as follows:--&quot;3 -*X cf. Telegrams to the Dominions about the Optional Clause Nos. 108 of 1/8/29 and 147 of 23/8/29, rejecting the policy which this Report expresses.
&quot;Standing as it does for the complete renunciation of the right of private war and private blockade, the Labour Party is little interested in ihe m   labelling of this or that practice of private war as legal or illegal 0     If a State begins a private^ war, Labour does not1&apos; acJHxt ^nat&apos; any&apos;&apos;pT i^.s&apos; ^elllgere^JpraotToes ^are^egypt^STmate t &quot;it&quot;&quot; regards iKat Sta/t&quot;e as commTtVing a or  me against the community of nations.If, however, it should be found necessary to discuss rules of private war, the Labour Party believes that. British policy should be directed towards maintaining the \maximum rights of free coaaaerce for neutrals and reducing to a. minimum the rights of privato belligerents. But the Labour Party is under.no Illusion as to the real and enduring value of any such code of rules for the conduct of private war. We believe it to be far better that effort should Bb ]concentrated wppp- JglS^ ridjejT this i.crime of&quot;&quot;private&apos; war^Ttoge^he^C4.     I cannot attempt here to give the reasons why I think the arguments advanced in this paper (B*R.82) should be rejected.      I only desire to submit to my colleagues that the late Government, in preparing this Report, were working on assumptions some of which we.reject3    and that, instead of basing our own policy on the assumptions of . their Report, we should refer the whole subject for re-examination by a reconstituted Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.      I suggest that Service representatives from the Service Departments should&apos; attend that Sub-Committee, only in the capacity of advisers to their political colleagues, and that they should bo free, of course, to express their views in the Subcommittee, but that they should not be actual members of the Sub-Committee and should not share in the responsibility for its Report.(Intd,)    P.November 6th,,19290
