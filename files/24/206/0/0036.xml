The Report covers only works of economic development in-stituted -to promote employment with the assistance of Government funds, and does not deal with the steps which I am taking in co-operation with my colleagues to develop the organisation of our industries and to foster exports and to which I attach very great im-portance.(IntdJ    J.HVT.24th October,  1929.

Tabular statements nave been prepared and are appended to this memorandum, showing the progress made in the submission examination ana approval of schemes for the relief of unemployment, but for a correct appreciation of the position, the^picture thus given requires to be supplemented by a few words of explanation.Table I shows the position In respect of schemes submitted to the Development  (Publio Utility) Advisory Committee, which, it will be recalled, was set up under the Chairmanship of Sir Arthur Duckham to examine applications for assistance submitted under Part I of the Development (loan Guarantees Sa Grants) Act, 1929 by undertakings carried on under statutory powers for providing transport or communication, gas, electricity, water or power..In addition to the schemes referred to in the tabular statement, the Directors of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway Company are this week considering a programme involving the expenditure of some  4 million which, if approved, will be submitted to the Committee.    Advance notices have also been received foreshadowing the submission of schemes amounting to some  15 million to &quot;be put in&apos;hand by the London Electric Railways.In this connection it should be mentioned that the General Managers of the Railway Companies have intimated their intention of setting up a representative Committee to examine urgently the proposed scheme for the London Outer Circle Railway.The Committee will be interested to learn that while Part    I of the Act allows assistance to be    given either by way of guarantee or by way of grants, practically ail the implications hitherto received have been for grants.
fable II shows the position in respect of schemes submitted to the Unemployment Grants Committee which under Part II of the Development  (Loan Guarantees &amp; Grants) Act is responsible under the Minister of Labour for schemes of public utility submitted by local authorities and by other statutory bodies carrying on undertakings otherwise than for profit.    It will be recalled that assistance is availablefi)    for areas suffering from severe and prolonged unemployment  (&quot;Non-transfer&quot; terras) -(ii) for other areas which, though not suffering fromsevere and prolonged&apos;unemployment, are prepared to employ a proportion of labour introduced from the depressed areas  (&quot;transfer&quot; terms).. She totals shown in the statement include a provisional offer to Manchester City Corporation in respect of a water scheme costing OT/er 5 millions.        In addition to the totals shown in the tabular statement as under consideration,  the Committee are discussing with the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, the Leith Dock Commissioners and other authorities dock schemes of total value of approximately 3 millions.      Improved terms for important schemes of this character have recently been settled &quot;between the Treasury and the Ministry of Labour, and will shortly be announced*      Important schemes amounting to approximately7,  2 million are also expected from the Birmingham City Council, for which, part of the assistance would cone from the Road Fund.Improved terms have also been decided upon in respect of certain minor classes of work,  such as municipal wash-houses, rural water supplies,  swimming baths, where the ^estimated revenue would fall so far short of the outgoings as to throw a substantial burden upon the rates unless the existing revenue producing terms were specially increased.       These
9 Q 7terms will also be announced shortly, and although the total amount of work that will be forthcoming imder them is not likely to be very substantial, they are expected to result in a number of proposals of considerable public utility.It should be added,  in explanation of the table that, while most of the schemes are financed by loan, provision also exists for paying a proportion of the labour costs of schemes of which the cost is met from revenue.       These latter are the schemes referred to as &quot;Wages&quot;.Table III shows the position in respect of programmes of road works receiving assistance from the Road Fund.    It will be remembered that the Committee approved proposals under which  9-g- million would be spent over a period of 4-5 years on the construction of Trunk Roads and a further  28 million on the improvement and construction of classified roads ov&apos;jer a period of 5-6 years..Table IV shows the position in respect of schemes submitted to the Committee appointed under the Colonial Develop-ment Act to examine applications for assistance from the Colonial Development Fund received from the Governments of Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories.The functions of the East Africa Guaranteed loan Advisory Committee have also been taken over by the same Committee, which will thus advise upon the allocation of the balance of the  10,000,0-00 in respect of which guarantees may be granted under the Palestine and Bast Africa loans Act, 1926.      It will be remembered that the provisions of the last mentioned Act were extended by the Colonial Development Act, 1929.    Table 17 includes applications dealt with under the Act of 1926.A few words of explanation are required as regards the scheme for the Zambesi Bridge.     This scheme.,  involving the expenditure of over  2-g- million, had previously been referred to the Bast Africa Guaranteed loan Advisory Committee, who. had
terms will also be announced shortly, and although the total amount of work that will be forthcoming under them is not likely to be very substantial, they are expected to result in a number of proposals of considerable public utility.^It should be added,  in explanation of the table that, while most of the schemes are financed by loan, provision also exists for paying a proportion of the labour costs of schemes of which the cost is met from revenue.       These latter are the schemes referred to as &quot;Y/ages&quot;.Table III shows the position in respect of programmes of road works receiving assistance from the Road Fund.    It will be remembered that the Committee approved proposals under which  9-J- million would be spent over a period of 4-5 years on the construction of Trunk Roads and a further  28 million on the improvement and construction of classified roads ov&apos;jer a period of 5-6 years-Table IV shows the position in respect of sehemes submitted to the Committee appointed under the Colonial Develop-ment Act to examine applications for assistance from the Colonial Development Fund received from the Governments of Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories.The functions of the East Africa Guaranteed Loan Advisory Committee have also been taken over by the same Committee, which will thus advise upon the allocation of the balance of the  10,000,GOO in respect of which guarantees may be granted under the Palestine and East Africa Loans Act, 1926.      It will be remembered that the provisions of the last mentioned Act were extended by the Colonial Development Act, 1929.    Table IV includes applications dealt with under the Act of 1926.A few words of explanation arc required as regards the scheme for the Zambesi Bridge.     This scheme.,  involving the expenditure of over  2-J- million, had previously been referred to the East Africa Guaranteed Loan Advisory Committee, who had
cj (ft Qw iO? Urecommended that the loan required should, be guaranteed under the Act of 1926 *      It had not, however, been possible to proceed as the Myasaland Government v.-as unable to bear the interest charges during the constructional period,  and there was no power to meet them from the loan, a difficulty which the Act of 1929 removes.      It has non been found that an a.&apos;ditional expenditure of  -f million will be necessary?  and the Secretary of State has asked the Advisory Committee to find this sum from the Colonial Development Fund.      The Advisory Committee strongly support the scheme and their recommendation is expected during the current week.In addition to the schemes dealt with in the tables appended, reference may also be made to certain comparatively minor programmes which, from the unemployment point of view, may be regarded as auxiliary.      It will be remembered that, while it was decided &quot;to await the passage of a Drainage Bill before instituting a comprehensive scheme of land drainage, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have continued the previous Government^ Land Drainage programme with improved terms.      Schemes involving the expenditure of some  25,000 have been sanctioned during the last 2 months.      Schemes of field drainage and. rural water supple are beginning to come in, but the contribution made by these schemes can never be anything but small.The Development Commission have since the change of . Government recommended assistance towards harbour works at fishery harbours estimated to cost come  70,000.      The Commissioners have up to now been restricted by lack of funds, but an additional sum of  500,000 Is now being placed at their disposal.The Committee will recall the&apos;expansion of  the programme of the Forestr:/ Commission from  5-1 million to  9 million.-4-
o.&apos;0iQfa O *JIt will be observed that the Tables appended show the estimated number of man-months of employment to be directly afforded.      These figures are based on the estimated wages costs, and (except in the case of Colonial Development schemes where the employment afforded in Great Britain is on the manufacture of plant, materials,  etc.,),they do not include the employment afforded by the preparation of the materials or their transport to the site.It has not been found possible to give at this stage figures showing the charge falling on public funds during the coming financial year, as this figure must depend upon the date at which works commence and on the speed with which thev progress.      Figures have however been given of the estimated total liability on national funds in respect of schemes approved,  and it is  felt that this figure gives a fairer measure of the contribution of the taxpayer than one showing the charges falling during a single year, having regard, to the fact that in most cases the grant takes the form of a part of the loan charges over a number of years.Tre a sury Chambe rs.24th October,- 1929.
