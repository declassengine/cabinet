s) 9 9te.j &amp; o*IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITTANIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. SECRET. C A 3 I N E T. Copy No.255(2?)* Battersea fower Station.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport,In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet I arranged for the Committee under the Chairmanship of the Government Chemist,consisting of:-Dr. Lander of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research;Dr. Bailey from the Ministry of Health;    and Mr. J.A. Macintyre from the Office of Works, to report on the progress of the investigations made by the London Power Company in connection with the problem of elimination of sulphur fumes in connection with the working of the proposed Battersea Power Station, and in conjunction with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, to advise the First Commissioner of Works and the Electricity Commissioners as to th&amp; efficacy of tile measures proposed to be adopted in this respect.The Committee report (copy annexed) that they have examined an interim report from the Chemists advising the London Power Company and consider that the experimental work so far reported indicates that by the use of water sprays in the experimental apparatus it is possible to eliminate from the gases of combustion nearly the whole of the sulphur gases present.      They say&quot;Prom what we have seen of the process in its small &quot;experimental stage, while we consider that it has &quot;afforded results that are promising, we consider that &quot;there are features in the experimental apparatus and &quot;process which are still obscure so that while we think &quot;there is no inherent reason why similar results should &quot;not be obtained from the larger experimental plant now &quot;being erected on the lines of a projected installation &quot;at Battersea, -we prefer to await the results afforded
&quot;by this larger experiment..      v7e think it necessary &quot;that a more definite explanation of the machanism. of &quot;the oxidation of sulphurous to sulphuric acid in the &quot;experimental process should be forthcoming before we &quot;can report on the practicability of the process&quot;.The report also deals with the discharge of the effluent containing the sulphur into the River.     This, they consider, should not cause difficulty and the Power Company are at present negotiating with the Port of London Authoritjr (see page y of the Report),As soon as Parliament meets., the Government will be pressed to publish the report of the Power Company^ Chemists and the comments of the Government Experts.The report of the Government Experts is satisfactory so * far as it goes, but leaves it open to the opponents of the scheme to press again for the abandonment of the Battersea Station,  or, &amp;t any rate, for a cessation of work until the further experiments can be concluded.      It is hoped too that the Experts will be in a position to report on the larger experiments to which they refer before the end of January.     As has previously been explained to the Cabinet,  the London Power Company has all the necessary consents to proceed with the work to which both the Battersea Council and the London County Council have agreed,  and they can only be made to suspend the work by legislation involving, of course, very considerable compensation.      The report of the experts,  so far from making it less likely that a complete solution will be found, indicates that good progress towards a solution has already been made.      I understand that the Government Chemist has made certain laboratory experiments on the mechanism of the chemical changes involved,  and these indicate an explanation which,  if correct,  is compatible with success on a large scale, &apos; -
*J &amp; I)It must &quot;be remembered that even when the first section of the Battersea Station, to which consent has been given,  is erected the Company are under continuous obligation to use the best methods of eliminating sulphur.     While the strongest opponents of the scheme are anxious to prevent even this first section,  the London County Council, whom the Minister of Health and the Minister of Transport met in deputation,  agree that it is impossible to suspend the work now in hand.A further question will arise with regard to the erection of a large municipal station at Fulhau.      The Minister of Health and the Minister of Transport have promised that no consent shall be given to Fulham until experimental work on a sufficient scale has satisfied the Government that the problem of the elimination of sulphur can be solved,  and that promise will, of course, be adhered to;    but opponents are pressing that no consent should be given to Fulham or any other generating station,in London until the first section at Battersea itself has been actually working.. The first section at Battersea may not be working until 19J2 ax?. 1 as a large power station takes from p to A years to construct it would be quite impossible to provide the necessary electricity fpr London on the lines laid down in the scheme for South Bast England unless work on the new station is coru.ien.ced before is)?..      The deputations who have raised the question have been clearly informed of this position.The foregoing memorandum which has been discussed with the Office of Works,  is concurred in by the Minister of Health.We recommend that the report of the Company1s Experts(together with the report of the Government Chemists&apos; Committee)should be published without delay so that it may be available forgeneral information and the consideration of the public bodiesiconcerned.(initialled) H.K.
GOVERNMENT IABOriATOlxY, Clement&apos;s Inn Passage,Strand, London, \7.C^2.3rd October,  1529.Sir,lie are now able to make a report in accordance with the terms of the letter of the 25th of May, 1929,(3.^.131),  in vrtiich we were asked &quot;to keep in touch with the progress of the investigations made by the London Power Company in connexion with the problem of elimination of sulphur fumes in connexion with the Y/orking of the proposed Battersea Power Station, and in conjunction j with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, to advise the First Commissioner of Torks and the Electricity Commissioners as to the efficacy of the measures proposed to be adopted in this respect&quot;.We have had the opportunity of examining in detail SMfe Interim report of the Advisers to the London Power Company to the Electricity Commissioners on their experimental work for the removal of sulphurous fumes from flue gases.Generally, we may say at the start that we consider the experimental -work so far reported indicates that by the use of water sprays in their experimental apparatus,  it is possible to eliminate from the gases of combustion nearly the whole of the sulphur gases present.In addition to seeing the Interim Report of the Advisers to the Power Company, we had the opportunity of inspecting the experimental   arrargements while in operation at Grove Road on 8th July, 1929, when neither acid taste nor objectionable odour could be detected by breathing the undiluted treated gases coming from the exit flue,
The analytical results as regards acidity of ingoing and. outgoing gases during an experimental run at Grove Road v/ere checked-by a representative of the Government Laboratory and the absorption of about 95/^ 0^ *be sulphur acids in the flue gases was confirmed.From what we have seen of the process in its small experimental stage, while we consider that it has afforded results that are promising, we consider that there are features in the experimental apparatus and process which are still abscure,  so that, while we think there is no inherent reason why similar results should not be obtained from the larger experimental plant now being erected on the lines of a projected installation at Battersea,  we prefer to await the results afforded by this  larger experiment. We think it necessary that a more definite explanation of the mechanism of the exidation of sulphurous to sulphuric acid in the experimental process should be forthcoming before we can report; on the practicability of the process.In connexion with this power station, very large quantities of condenser water are to be used, as much as $00 tons, we were informed,  for every ton of coal burned.      A portion only of this Quantity should be required, for washing the gases.      We have ascertained that the alkalinity of Thames tidal water near Battersea is about 20 parts per 100,000.      Five hundred tons of such water would have twice as much alkalinity as is necessary to neutralise the sulphur acids derived from one ton of coal containing 1. %b of total sulphur,  even assuming that no sulphur remains in the clinker.      Under these conditions there is no chance of an acid effluent going into the river if all the condenser water is systematically utilised for neutralisation, and this condenser water before being withdrawn maintains the required alkalinity, but there is a chance of some calcium sulphite remaining in solution. This, although a neutral salt, might be objected to,  on account of
9 9 0cJ i-i O;\ &apos;*its property of further depleting the river or oxygen....... Prom  he-ready oxidisability of sulphurous acid and sulphites., their total conversion&quot; into sulphuric acid and sulphates should be easy, in which case the effluent water at Battersea would still retain a certain alkalinity, and would &quot;be altered only in the sense of having in solution a small quantity of innocuous calcium sulphate.7/e understand that mechanical separators are to be used for eliminating the bulk of the dust;    the washing process which the gases undergo for removal of sulphur acids should prevent the escape of most of the residual dust particles, but we have no experimental data on this aspect of the question.7/e are, Sir,Your obedient Servants,(Sgd*) R. Robertson.      Chairman.&quot; C H, Lander.&quot; J. Macintyre.&quot; T. Lewis Bailey.The Secretary,Ministry of Transport, 6, Whitehall Gardens, 3.7.1.
