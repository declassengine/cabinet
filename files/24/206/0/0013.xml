Enclosure 4 in No. 1.Mr. A. Henderson to Dr. Stresemann.British Delegation,Your Excellency, The Hague, 30th August, 1929.IT is^the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to withdraw the British forces at present in occupation of the rhineland at an early date, but the speed with which such evacuation can be accomplished depends upon the nature of the Agreement which may be come to with the Government of the Reich.This evacuation cannot be effected rapidly unless the German Government are prepared to give instructions to their authorities to facilitate in every way the withdrawal of the troops and will also agree to waive certain claims such as those under Article 6 and Articles 8-12 of the Rhineland Agreement. Experience has shown that the assessment of claims under these Articles is a lengthy business. The British Government fears that the investigation of the facts in connexion with such claims as may arise in future would necessitate the retention in the Rhineland of various elements of the Army of Occupation which might be withdrawn with the other troops if the claims are waived.Among the services which the British authorities look to the German authorities to supply is the provision of :Rolling stock for the evacuation of personnel and animals, and the assistance of the railway authorities in arranging time-tables;Barges and tugs on the Rhine, together with the necessary personnel;The personnel necessary for taking over, as and when required, barracks, buildings,- lands and accommodation of all sorts as well as furniture and stores belonging to the Reich.Engineer fittings such as stoves, baths, geysers, etc., will be taken over in situ as there will not be time to dismantle such fittings and hand them over unfixed.I should be glad also to receive an assurance that: Any soldiers or members of families of soldiers who at the moment of evacuation are ill and unable to travel will be received into German civilian hospitals and kept there at the expense of His Majesty&apos;s Government until they can return home; sick animals and those suffering from contagious diseases will be received into German civilian veterinary hospitals;-No objection will be raised to guards in uniform travelling on the barges for the protection of stores in the course of evacuation by the Rhine, and also that no customs dues will be imposed on British Government property which is disposed of locally in order to avoid evacuation.The British authorities look to the German authorities to provide any labour which is required for assisting the evacuation.The claims Your Excellency&apos;s Government are invited to waive are those claims under Articles 8-12 of the Rhineland Agreement, and those claims in respect of damages under Article 6, which will not have been finally settled before 1st September and included in the monthly returns already rendered to the Agent General or (as regards Article 6) paid in cash.The waiver will thus include both claims for services rendered and damages caused before 1st September which have not been finally settled before that date and claims in respect of services rendered or damages caused after 31st August, including those in connection with the evacuation.It is understood that the German Government will secure that the services to be rendered after 31st August 1929 wall be rendered as promptly and adequately as heretofore and His Majesty&apos;s Government undertake to exercise the same reasonable moderation in demanding services as hitherto, and to give instructions to this effect to the General Officer Commanding in Chief.As regards requisitions under Article 6 of the Rhineland Agreement, His Majesty&apos;s Government will continue as heretofore to pay for them by means of German currency which will be obtained from the Reich and will be credited against the Dawes Annuities so long as these continue to be paid. And other claims which have been or might be put forward by the German Government against His Majesty&apos;s Government under Article 6 will be waived.The above provisions apply to the British Army of Occupation in the Rhineland and the British Section of the Rhineland High Commission.
The above waiver of claims is proposed and accepted in order to facilitate the early withdrawal of the British troops from the Rhineland and is agreed to independently of the putting into force of the Young Plan.At the date when the special account of the Agent General for Reparation Payments was closed on November 30th, 1928, a credit balance was outstanding in favour of His Majesty&apos;s Government. This balance has gradually been diminished by debits which have been accepted against it. Should there be any balance on this account on 1st September, 1929, the payment of such balance will be waived by His Majesty&apos;s Government and it would accordingly be retained by the German Government.The same arrangement will apply to any balances existing in favour of the British Government which arise out of advances previously made by the Agent General in respect of Article 6 and Articles 8-12 of the Rhineland Agreement. The British Government also waives any claim to the sale value of any buildings con-structed by the German Government for the British Army and charged to the Annuity.If the above arrangements are accepted by Your Excellency, it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to commence the evacuation about the middle of September and to complete it in a period of approximately three months.I avail myself, etc.(Sgd.)

[C 6709/1/181 No. 1.Mr. A. Henderson to Sir R. Lindsay. (Received August 31.)(No. 65.)Sir, The Hague, August 30, 1929.I THINK it will be useful to record in one document the course of the political discussions at The Hague, which terminated in the signature of the agreements enclosed in my despatch No. 45 of to-day&apos;s date.2. Although the financial discussions of the conference necessarily assumed the greatest importance and from the outset loomed largest in the public eye, it must not be supposed that on the political side the conference remained inactive. On the contrary, there was from the beginning general agreement on the desirability  indeed the necessity of reaching a solution of the political issues involved, and it soon became clear that once agreement on the financial issue was reached, the political problems would be solved without much difficulty. The task of the British delegation was, first, to endeavour to secure the final evacuation of the Rhineland by all the Allied troops at the earliest possible date, and, secondly, to use their influence and ingenuity in drafting some document to cover the French demand for a &apos;&apos; Comite de Conciliation et de Constatation,&quot; which, while being sufficiently anodyne to satisfy the Germans, could at the same time be plausibly shown to meet the requirements of the French.3. With these objects in view I stated, when opening the first meeting of the Political Commission on the 8th August, that the commission had to deal with the first and third of the Geneva resolutions of the 16th September, 1928, viz. : (1) To settle the date of the evacuation of the Rhineland; and (2) to establish some organisation for dealing with possible future disputes in the demilitarised zone. I considered that sub-committees of experts would doubtless be required to deal with these two questions in detail in due course, but I suggested that, in the first place, there should be a general discussion, and ended by expressing the belief that, although for the moment it was the financial discussions which had caught the public interest, this conference would in the long run be judged by the results obtained in the political field.4. M. Briand, who followed, immediately made it clear that the solution of -the political side of the conference was dependent upon a definite settlement on the financial side. The French Government, he said, were ready to accept an early evacuation of the whole of the Rhineland, but only on condition that the conference reached a financial settlement which could be practically applied. As regards the question of &quot; Conciliation et Constatation,&quot; he proposed to submit to the commission certain proposals which would be found not in the least to impose anything in the nature of military control in the demilitarised zone, but to remain strictly within the framework of the Treaty of Locarno.5. Dr. Stresemann adopted the standpoint that there was no real connexion between the political questions and the financial questions arising out of the settlement of the reparation problem. After restating the old German argument that Germany is now legally entitled to evacuation (an argument which M. Briand subsequently refuted), he claimed that it was of the highest importance for Germany to reach a settlement of the political questions involved, as the acceptance of the Young plan by Germany was conditional on a satisfactory solution of the problem of the occupied territories, and in any event, there was a general desire to limit the costs of the armies of occupation after the 1st September to the minimum.6. It thus became immediately clear that the French would not seriously approach the question of evacuation until signs of a financial settlement were evident, and that no progress was likely to be made by discussion in open commission unless some attempt were first made privately to reconcile the existing differences. I accordingly adjourned the commission until the 9th August, and stated that I proposed in the meantime to have private interviews with M. Briand and Dr. Stresemann.  I duly visited M. Briand and Dr. Stresemann on the morning ofif&amp;MnBMlMBHlBn
the 9th August, and explained frankly to the former that the general policy of the Labour party when in opposition and their election promises dictated an immediate withdrawal of the British troops from the Rhineland, but that I had purposely delayed doing so as I desired to maintain the most cordial relations with the French Government and to work in close co-operation with them. I could, however, now delay no longer. M. Briand, after expressing thanks for this frank and friendly explanation, said that he.did not think there was any real divergence of opinion between the two countries. He said that if there were an agreement on the Young-plan he hoped to obtain ratification thereof by the French Parliament towards the middle or end of October, and then evacuation could be begun. To this I rejoined by expressing disappointment at the delay which would thus take place, as my idea was to begin the evacuation of the British troops by about the 15th September. M. Briand then intimated that, when speaking of ratification by the French Parliament as a necessary preliminary to evacuation of the French troops, he had referred to evacuation of the third zone only. He was ready for evacuation of the second zone to begin at the same time as, or shortly after, the evacuation of the British troops. This was the first occasion on which M. Briand attempted to distinguish between the evacuation of the second and third zones, and I immediately pointed out the disadvantages which would arise if there were any interval between the evacuation of the two zones. Once begun, evacuation should, in our opinion, be continuous. M. Briand agreed with this, but it was clear that he had doubts as to its practicability from the French point of view.7. I then called on Dr. Stresemann and indicated the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to withdraw the British troops from the Rhineland. I pointed out, however, that ever since the occupation of the Rhineland there had been continual disputes with the German Government on the question of claims arising out of articles 6 and 8-12 of the Rhineland Agreement, and it was one of our objects at this conference to induce the German Government to waive their claims in return for early evacuation. I said that I hoped the British troops would have left the Rhineland by Christmas, and in return I asked Dr. Stresemann to deal with the question of the claims in a large and conciliatory spirit. Dr. Stresemann agreed to this, and the bases for subsequent agreement were laid.8. The second meeting of the Political Commission, w*hich was held as arranged, at 4 p.m. on the 9th August, was devoted to a discussion on the question of the &quot; Comite de Conciliation et de Constatation.&quot; M. Briand developed his proposals on the subject, the details of which he proposed should be worked out by a committee of jurists. Dr. Stresemann said that he had supposed that M. Briand would have presented concrete proposals and he could not himself see the necessity for providing any machinery beyond that existing in the Treaty of Locarno. This led to a long discussion, and finally it was agreed that M. Briand would produce his proposal and that it should be referred to a committee of jurists. I then proposed that a technical sub-committee should be set up to present a detailed report on the question of evacuation, but M. Briand asked that before this committee were set up he might have a private discussion with Dr. Stresemann. In consequence, the commission adjourned until the 12th August.9. At the end of the first week, therefore, the position in the Political Commission was not unsatisfactory. It had been agreed to set up a committee of jurists to consider the question of disputes in respect of the demilitarised zone, and a start had been made on the question of fixing a date for the evacuation of the Rhineland. Unfortunately, this progress was not maintained. Already, on the 10th August, M. Massigli, sent by M. Briand, had explained to Sir E. Phipps that when M. Briand had had his interview with me on the 9th August he had not realised that the British troops were in the third zone. He asked, therefore, that the British evacuation should be retarded or that it should be begun later than the 15th September. It was explained that this would be impossible as I was determined that the last British soldier should have left the Rhineland by Christmas. On the following day M. Briand circulated to the commission his proposal for a &quot; Comite de Conciliation et de Constatation,&quot; and it was immediately seen that this would he unacceptable to the Germans. It was, indeed, the same proposal as had been put forward by the French in February last (see &quot;Germany&quot; Print, the 27th February, 1929, Section 1).10. It thus became clear that the French were disinclined to make progress in the Political Commission so long as a solution on the financial side appeared unlikely, and all doubt on this score was laid to rest on the 12th August at the next meeting of
the commission, when M. Briand begun the discussion by making a declaration to the effect that nothing decided upon in the Political Commission would become effective until a settlement had been reached in the Financial Commission. This naturally led Dr. Stresemann to restate the German point of view. He added that he did not think that it was any function of the Political Commission to discuss the method of carrying out evacuation, which was a matter solely for the occupying Powers. This led to a long and profitless discussion, and I finally stated that it was useless to set up a technical committee on evacuation until points of principle had been accepted. -*I adjourned the commission until the 14th August, and, in the meantime, called a private meeting of the heads of the French, Belgian, German and British delegations. It may here be remarked that at this time M. Massigli produced a lists of points regarding the regime in the demilitarised zone after evacuation. He said that it was essential that these should be cleared up in conversation with the Germans, and was informed that in principle we agreed and were prepared to accept any solution which the French and Germans were able to arrive at. No progress was, however, made on these points.11. The main point of principle to be decided by the Foreign Ministers was the final date of evacuation. If this were settled the military experts could meet and discuss the details involved and report to the commission. I put this to MM. Briand, Stresemann and Hymans at a private meeting on the 13th August. I said that I was very anxious for the Prime Minister to be in a position to announce at Geneva that the evacuation of the British troops would be begun while the Assembly was in session, i.e., on the 15th September. If this were done the British troops would have left the Rhineland by Christmas, provided that the German Government would waive all claims under articles 6 and 8-12 of the Rhineland Agreement. I asked M. Briand and M. Hymans to give their views on the final date of evacuation, and Dr. Stresemann to explain the German position on the question of a waiver. M. Briand said that the French troops could be out of the second zone by the end of December, and M. Hymans intimated that Belgian evacuation could be completed in the same time, provided in each case that the Germans gave a waiver in respect of the claims. M. Briand also expressed the opinion that a small force of British troops should be left in the Rhineland until the end of the evacuation, as, without them, it would be impossible for Great Britain to be represented on the Rhineland High Commission. This argument is erroneous. The British High Commissioner could quite well remain on even when the British troops had been withdrawn. It was subsequently found impossible to conform with M. Briand&apos;s suggestion as the British military experts held strongly that it would be impossible to leave behind a detachment of British troops after the departure of the main body. As will be seen later, however, I agreed to Mr. Seeds remaining on in the Rhineland after the departure of the British troops.12. Dr. Stresemann, supported by Dr. Wirth, explained that it would be very difficult for him to approach the German Government on the question of-a waiver until the exact date of final evacuation was settled, and on this point no real progress could be made, but M. Briand undertook to consult his military experts as to the date to be fixed for the termination of evacuation and to inform his colleagues in three or four days. The position, therefore, was that there was general agreement upon the dates for the commencement of evacuation and for the completion of the evacuation of the second zone. Further progress depended upon the French. I therefore decided to call no further meeting of the Political Commission until after a further private meeting to be held when M. Briand was ready.13. This did not mean, however, that all activities were at a standstill. I had announced that the British troops would be out of the Rhineland by Christmas if the Germans were conciliatory on the question of the waiver, and it appeared likely that, even if no arrangement were come to between the French, the Belgians and the Germans, there was a good chance of our coming to terms Avith Germany on this point. Accordingly, the British military experts prepared, on my instructions, a draft note which set forth British desiderata in connexion with the evacuation and the waiver, in return for which we undertook to evacuate the Rhineland in ninety days. This was put into final shape in consultation with the Treasury and Sir C. Hurst during the next few days. The text, as finally communicated to Dr. Stresemann, forms enclosure No. 4 in my despatch under reference.14. The next meeting between the Foreign Ministers was held on Monday, the 19th August, but very little progress was made. M. Briand was unable, or unwilling, to state a definite date for the completion of evacuation, and Dr. Stresemann,
therefore, declined to discuss further the question of the waiver. At the close of the meeting, however, I handed to Dr. Stresemann privately and confidentially the draft of the note which I proposed to address to him on the subject of separate British evacuation (see the preceding paragraph). Whether or not the Germans communicated this to the French is not known, but on the next day M. Massigli expressed to Sir E. Phipps disappointment that the British military experts had discussed these matters with the Germans and refused to do so with the French and Belgians. This was not strictly true, as the British military representatives had never declined to discuss any question with their French and Belgian colleagues, but it was M. Briand himself who had deprecated any discussions regarding evacuation and its connected problems pending further progress in the Financial Commission. Sir E. Phipps, however, stated that he was sure that I would welcome conversations between the French, British and Belgian military experts, and I immediately authorised these discussions.15. A further meeting of the Foreign Ministers was held on the 21st August, at which I announced that I understood agreement had been reached by the Committee of Jurists on a formula for the &apos; Commission de Conciliation et de Constatation,&quot; but that I was unaware of the exact details of their proposal. M. Briand explained that, the French draft circulated on the 11th August having proved unacceptable to the German representatives, he had agreed to a suggestion put forward by M. Fromageot, his legal adviser, that the situation might be met by utilising the conciliation committees provided for in the Locarno treaties. Agreement had then been reached. Dr. Stresemann confirmed this, but stated that he could not definitely accept the formula at the moment. It was clear that he would not commit himself on this until he knew the intentions of the French Government as to the final date of evacuation.16. In these circumstances, I decided that I must endeavour to advance the work of the Political Commission with more rapidity. I said that I must leave for Geneva during the following week, and I proposed to hold another meeting of the Foreign Ministers on Thursday, the 22nd August, and convene the Political Commission for Friday, the 23rd August. I expressed the hope that at the Foreign Ministers&apos; meeting on the 22nd August it would be possible to agree on the formula for conciliation, that M. Briand would be able to give a definite date for evacuation, and that Dr. Stresemann would make a definite statement as to the intentions of the German Government on the question of waiver of the claims. This move had immediate effect. The German delegation had already notified the British delegation that they accepted in toto the British demands in connexion with the waiver and the arrangements for the evacuation, and Dr. Stresemann accordingly said that, on the assumption that the British troops were withdrawn by the end of the year, the German Government would be ready, in principle, and subject to a settlement of the details, to waive all claims under articles 6 and 8-12 against the British forces. They would also grant the same treatment to the Belgian forces if they were out of the Rhineland by the end of the year, and they would give the same benefit to the French forces if they would evacuate the territory by the 1st April, 1930. M. Briand immediately declared that this was impossible. The effect upon French public opinion, if this proposal were known, would be disastrous. It was doubtless possible for the British and Belgians to evacuate their relatively small forces in three months, but the French had some 50,000 men and considerable permanent works and installations. The German proposal was, in fact, discrimination against France. M. Briand developed the arguments which he had used earlier in the Political Commission to show that it was impossible to evacuate the French troops in that time, stressing particularly the impossibility of moving the troops in winter after the commotion which had arisen in France over the army scandals of last winter, and ended by asking why the Germans had suggested the 1st April as the final date. Dr. Stresemann replied that it was essential for Germany to have a final date if she were to consider a waiver, and that, as M. Briand had declined to state one, the German delegation felt compelled to fix one themselves. M. Briand, however, refused to alter his ground or consider the 1st April as in any way possible as a final date. He said that unde? present arrangements 10,000 French troops would have left the second zone by November, and that, if they did not participate equally with the British and Belgians in the waiver, they should not move at all. After some further discussion, during which both M. Hymans and I endeavoured to lessen the tension between the French and Germans, M. Briand finally consented to inform the commission of the final date which the French contemplated-and which he said he had
already privately communicated to Dr. Stresemann. The date proved to be the end of September 1930. M. Briand said that it would take six months to evacuate the third zone. Evacuation of material would continue throughout the winter, but the men would not begin to move until the end of March, and their evacuation would be completed six months later.17. This meeting, therefore, ended in something like a deadlock. No definite decision had been taken on the question of the &quot; Comite de Conciliation et de Constatation?&quot; and on the question of the final date of the evacuation the Germans were ready to give the French a waiver of claims if their troops were withdrawn by the 1st April, while the French insisted on the impossibility of completing evacuation before the end of September 1930. I accordingly endeavoured the next day to bridge the gap separating the French and Germans by addressing a private letter to M. Briand which contained the suggestion that the evacuation of the third zone should be begun by the French troops immediately the French Parliament had ratified the decision of the conference and be completed within eight months. Ratification might be expected in mid-October, and by hastening somewhat the evacuation might thus be completed by the 31st May, 1930; provided, of course, that the Germans would give the same conditions as if evacuation had been completed by the 1st April. M. Briand returned a cordial reply, but indicated in detail his difficulties and explained that ratification by the French Parliament could not be expected at the earliest before the end of October, and, therefore, on my suggestion, the 30th June would be the earliest final date. This would be only three months earlier than the date he had originally suggested, and he could not-believe that this would make any difference.18. I decided that matters could not be left in this state, and therefore I summoned a further meeting of the Foreign Ministers on the 23rd August. At this meeting a further endeavour was made to bridge the gap and some success was attained. M. Briand thought evacuation might be completed by the 30th June and Dr. Stresemann agreed to allow his offer of a waiver to stand if evacuation were completed by the 30th April. Thus, only two months separated the parties, and it was agreed that the military experts of the occupying Powers should endeavour to draw up a joint scheme for evacuation for presentation to the German delegation, on the understanding that in any event no change should be made in the date of the evacuation of the British troops. This unfortunately proved impossible, as the problem was different for each army. The final date of the evacuation and the German waiver of claims against France had, therefore, to be left open.19. On the 24th August a further meeting of the Foreign Ministers was held and the question of the, &apos;&apos; Comite de Conciliation et de Constatation &apos;&apos; was again under consideration. The Jurists&apos; Report was discussed and it was agreed that it could be taken as a basis for the drafting of a formula which the delegations would further consider. There was every hope that this question would be finally disposed of. At this meeting M. Briand raised with me the question of the British section of the Rhineland High Commission. He expressed his strong desire that the solidarity of the occupying Powers should be maintained, in form at any rate, and he urged that Mr. Seeds should be allowed to remain on as British High Commissioner, even after the withdrawal of the British forces. This question had already been discussed with the Foreign Office and in the British delegation, and it was felt that it would be more logical that Mr. Seeds should withdraw with the British army. At the same time, as the French attached importance to his remaining, and as he would only be in the Rhineland for a few months without any British troops, I decided to meet the wishes of the French in this connexion, and notified M. -Briand on the 25th August that His Majesty&apos;s Government would agree to Mr. Seeds continuing to serve on the High Commission on condition that the French Government would afford him any assistance he might irequire. I took the opportunity once more to impress on M. Briand the hope that he would be able to agree to complete the evacuation of the French troops by an earlier date.20. The position, therefore, at the end of the third week was that agreement had been practically reached on a formula for the &quot; Comite de Conciliation et de Constatation,&quot; but no definite date had yet been agreed upon for the completion of the evacuation. It seemed clear, however, that some decision must soon be reached on the financial question, and it was necessary that the Political Commission should be ready to report to the full conference as soon as this took place. I therefore drev up a draft report for the Political Commission, and this was discussed by tli** Foreign Ministers on the 27th August.   There was general agreement upon that
part of the draft which dealt with conciliation, but M. Briand refused to commit himself to a final date for evacuation until the financial position was clearer.21. General agreement on the financial question having been reached among the five Powers early on the 28th August, it was hoped that the Political Commission might conclude its labours on that day. Unfortunately, an acute difference of opinion arose between the ex-Allied Powers and Germany on the question of occupation costs after the 31st August, 1929. This question having been left open,-by the Young Report, an endeavour was made to induce the Germans to bear the total cost in return for early evacuation. This they steadfastly refused to do, with the result that the debate on this point continued until 2 a.m. on the 29th August without any settlement being obtained. It was decided, nevertheless, not to subordinate the entire work of the Political Commission to a settlement of this particular point, and accordingly the four Foreign Ministers met at 11 a.m. on the 29th August and reached agreement upon the report which the Political Commission should submit to the conference. The completion of the work of the Political Commission was necessarily subject to agreement being reached on the question of occupation costs, which was remitted for discussion between financial experts.22. It was thus found possible to hold the final meeting of the Political Commission at 12 noon on the 29th August, when the report to the conference was adopted. A copy is annexed. It will be seen that agreement was reached as to the date of the completion of the evacuation of the Rhineland and as to the method of settling any future disputes regarding the observance of articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles. During the afternoon of the 29th August complete agreement was reached between the occupying Powers and Germany on the question of occupation costs, and, as the work of the Financial Commission was still not completed, and Ministers were anxious to leave for Geneva, it was decided to put the political agreement finally on record by an exchange of notes. The original proposal was that the British, French and Belgian representatives should sign a joint note to the German representative covering the separate notes which each had addressed to Dr. Stresemann laying down the conditions of evacuation which the latter had accepted. The agreement regarding the observance of articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles should be recorded in the Final Protocol of the conference. This procedure was, however, objected to by the French delegation, and finally the agreements resulting from the labours of the Political Commission were recorded in the following manner :- At a meeting of the six inviting Powers held on the 30th August, the representatives of the occupying Powers, Great Britain, France and Belgium, signed a joint note to Dr. Stresemann which enclosed separate notes in which the evacuation requirements of each Power were laid down. The note proceeded to ask for the assurance that Germany accepted these requirements. Dr. Stresemann replied by accepting all the demands, and the joint note and Dr. Stresemann&apos;s reply were exchanged. Then that part of the report of the Political Commission to the conference, which dealt with the observance of articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles, was drawn up in the form of an agreement and signed by the representatives of the Powers signatory of the Treaty of Locarno, viz., Great Britain, France, Belgium, Italy and Germany. Both this agreement and Dr. Stresemann &apos;s reply to the joint note of the three occupying Powers were entrusted to the custody of the British representative.23. Complete agreement on the political side of the conference was thus reached. It will be seen that the discussions were throughout necessarily subordinated to progress on the financial side and that practically no negotiations were possible in open commission. The moment, however, that it became clear that a settlement on the financial side was in sight, both M. Briand and Dr. Stresemann showed the most conciliatory spirit, and I feel confident that the solution of the political problems before the conference will be generally acceptable to all the nations concerned.I am, &amp;c.ARTHUR HENDERSON.
Enclosure in No. 1. Report of the Political Commission.THE deliberations of the Political Commission were concerned with two subjects firstly, the evacuation of the Rhineland, and, secondly, the method of dealing with possible difficulties relating to the observance of articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles.As regards the first, the commission are happy to be able to report that the three occupying Powers have agreed to begin the process of evacuation during the month of September. The Belgian and British forces will have withdrawn completely within three months of the date on which operations start, while the French troops will evacuate the second zone within the same time limit. The withdrawal of the French troops from the third zone will be begun immediately after ratification by the French and German Parliaments and the putting into operation of the Young plan, and&apos;the withdrawal will proceed without interruption as rapidly as physical conditions permit, and, in any case, will be completed in a period of eight month? and not later than the end of June 1930.As regards the second subject, the Political Commission, charged with the solution of the questions raised under paragraph 3 of the Geneva Agreement of the 16th September, 1928, resolves to recommend to the interested Powers the following resolution : In order to facilitate in the common interest a friendly and practical settlement of any difficulty which may arise between Belgium and Germany or between France and Germany concerning the observance of articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles, the German, Belgian and French Governments agree that the task of settling amicably any such difficulty shall be accomplished by the commission set up under the arbitration agreements concluded at Locarno on the 16th October, 1925, by Belgium and by France with Germany. These commissions shall act in conformity with the procedure laid down and with the rights accruing under these conventions.If any such difficulty should arise, it will be submitted either to the Belgo-German Conciliation Commission or to the Franco-German Conciliation Commission, according to whether the difficulty arises between Belgium and Germany or between France and Germany.This agreement does not in any way affect the general provisions applicable in such case and in particular is subject to the reservation that the powers of the Council and Assembly of the League of Nations to make investigations under article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles remain intact. It is also subject to the understanding that each of the Powers who signed the treaty concluded at Locarno on the 16th October, 1925, between Germany, Belgium, France, Great Britain and Italy retains the &quot;right to lay any difficulty at any time before the Council of the League of Nations in conformity with article 4 of that treaty.o
