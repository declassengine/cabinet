9* 9 (iO O W(rxyCDMEHT 13 IHB PROPER^ CP HI3 JBRIgAHNIC MAJESTY&apos; 3 GoyiCRll^t;?).mm cow ..3 /Q.P. &amp;96(29).    -c ii b i n i.SLUMS.Memorandum by Minister of Health,1* $he Government have announced that one of theprinolpal measures whioh they will introduce in the first Session of Parliament will be a Bill to secure that slum conditions shall be effectively dealt with.     Steps have already been taken by the Housing (Revision of Contributions) Act., 1989, to alter the decision of .the late Government that the subsidy for houses provided for lotting under the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1924, should be reduced as from 1st October, 1929.     It is generally accepted that the   Hflieatley Act of 1924 makes adequate provision to secure a continuous programme for the building of houses ordinarily required for the working classes and it is undesirable to interfere with the normal working of that Act.The position as regards dealing with the slums however, is different.     Progress is slow and the operations being carried out are, taking the country as a whole, on an insignifioant scale.       Publio opinion expects that much more should be done.     I think it iB clear that we must aot through the local authorities, and happily the disposition of these bodies who are now somewhat relieved from the difficulties oaused by the worst pressure of housing shortage, is favourable to action. 2. The principal factors whioh militate age in at thedevelopment of a big slum clearance policy ore -
The shortage of accommodation available for persons dahoused by clearances.Hie special difficulty oaused by the fact that a considerable proportion of the inhabitants of slums can only afford a rent lower than what is normally charged for municipal houses.The magnitude and cost of the operations.The time taken to carry out schemes of any size.Difficulties in the execution of schemes arising out of certain decisions of the Courts. Mention should also be made of the basis of compensation for properties included in slum clearance schemes, which in some quarters is regarded as- so drastic as to deter local authorities from the due exercise of their powers.3. I think it is essential that&apos; the plan we lay before Parliament should primarily take account of these factors.      The primary problem of slum clearance in present circumstances is the problem of providing accommodation for the persons displaced.The speed with which slum improvement can be carried out is dependent on the rate at which dwellings for the dispossessed can be provided and the matter is complicated by the consideration that a proportion of the Inhabitants of slums are unable to pay norme1 rents.
A cardinal part of our proposals must therefore be directed to facilitating the provision of new houses for slum dwellers including arrangements which will enable the local authorities to supply the needs of the poorer slum inhabitants.M We should also aim at simplifying and shorteningprocedure both in the making and in the oarrying out of slum schemes and we should endeavour to provide a means whereby it will be possible for local authorities to reduce the capital expenditure which schemes have entailed in the past.     Exchequer assistance should be available on a basis which will encourage local authorities to activity and this assistance should be granted in such a form as to give the authorities as much freedom as possible from detailed central control.     Adequate provision should of course be made to compel action where a local authority is negligent or fails to take a proper view of its responsibilities.In the course of simplifying procedure the opportunity should bo taken to recast the statutory provisions so as to got rid of the legal difficulties which are at present holding up schemes.The town planning of built-up areas will be of importance as a means of preventing slums in the future and I have this question immediately, under consideration:    it will however, I thinM, be a matter for separate legislation.I am not prepared to suggest any serious alteration in the basis of compensation - to do so would
be to increase tho cost.of schemes and to defeat the object we have in view - but I think it may be possible to introduce some modifications which, without interfering with the . principle of the basis of compensation may soften some of its asperities.4.     Procciduren for the making of Slum Clearance Schemes.The present procedure for the making of Slum Clearance Sohemos is extremely cumbrous.    The Housing Act contemplates two kinds of schemes, slum clearance schemes, namely improvement schemes, which are tho more important, and reconstruction schemes;    these two classas are, however, not always readily distinguishable.      The improvement scheme starts with a representation from the Medical officer of Health that an area suffers from cortain defects and that the most satisfactory way of dealing with the evils of the area is an improvement scheme.     The local authority have to take this representation into consideration and if satisfied of its truth and of the sufficiency, of th&amp;ir resouroes they have to pass a resolution to the effect, that the area is an unhealthy area and that an improvement scheme ought to be made in respect of it.   After passing this resolution it is their duty forthwith to make an improvement scheme.,When the scheme (which, in the light of the recent decisions of the Courts, must indicate in precise detail what is to be the future development of the area) has beer&apos; made,  the local authority has to advertise the fact that a scheme has been made and doposit a copy of it for inspection; it has tc serve a notice on every owner, lessee and occupier of any lands proposed to be taken compulsorily and ask each to state whether or nut he dissents from the taking of such lands. When these roquire-ments have been complied with, the authority must present a petition to tho Minister of Health praying that an Order may be made
9 &amp;10onflrmlng the- scheme.     It is the invariable practice of the Minister to hold a looal Inquiry into a proposal to make a scheme: after the Inquiry if the Minister is satisfied that the making of a scheme is proper he makes an Order, which has the force of an Act of Parliament, confirming the scheme.As already indicated, recent decisions in the Courts (the principal case is R. v. Minister of Health ex parta Davis, ordinarily known as the Derby case) have greatly increased the difficulties of carrying out Improvement schemes and indeed have, practioally made slum clearance unworkable.     The broad effect of this decision is that a scheme cannot be considered unless it states in precise detail what the redevelopment of a cleared area is to be.     It i3 quite an Impracticable and unreasonable requirement.     There can be little doubt that the action taken by the property owners in this matter has been dictated, not by any reasonable desire to know jlnat the future development of their property was to be, but by a desire to torpedo 3lum schemes so that they should not be subject to the compensation provisions.     It is of course fair that owners, so far as they wish to defend their land from compulsory purchase at site value, should have an oppor-tunity of compelling the local authority to establish that the conditions precedent for slum clearance obtain.      But it is neither fair nor logical that the owners should be entitled to go further and criticise the proposals for dealing with the land after the slum has been cleared.1 propose to draw a sharp distinction between the procedure under which an area is declared to be insanitary and eligible for slum clearance and the subsequent procedure under which the authority deal with the area w.xen cleared.     The owners will be concerned with tho first but not with the second.I propose to dispense altogether with a &quot;scheme&quot; and simply to enable the local authority, on being satisfied,
either on the representation of their Medical Officer of Health or otherwise, that an area Is eligible for slum clearance, to make a compulsory purchase order, on lines similar to the orders made by local authorities when they acquire land compulsorlly for house-building.     When such an order has been made, it will be the duty of the Minister, if there is opposition to hold a local inquiry, or if there is no opposition to confirm the Order unless he is of opinion that the land is unsuitable or for any other reason the Order should not be confirmed.It&quot;will, of course, be necessary to provide in the new Statute that where a local authority acquire&apos; an area for clearance, they must,, if the Minister so requires, before displacing any person of the working classes, provide houses sufficient to accommodate such number of persons as the Minister may determine.A general power would also be given in the Statute to the local authority to deal with any land they acquire, by the erection of houses upon it, by laying out open spaces, by appropriating land for streets or.other purposes for which local authorities may acquire land and by selling or letting it with or without restrictions and conditions. 5* Alternative procedure designed to reduce capital expenditure to be ayaliable to Iceal authorities.One of the factors which prevents local authorities from making as much use of their slum powers as they might, is the heavy capital cost of purchasing an area and the knowledge that the cleared area must frequently stand Idle and be a source of serious expense for a long period.I propose, therefore to empower local authorities, on being satisfied that an area is eligible for slum clearance to make an order requiring the owners to demolish
the houses within a specified period.    No compensation -^auld be payable to the o^ers and they would make their own arrangements about redeveloping the cleared  ,,rea subject to any looal bye-la&apos;vs or regulations or any town planning scheme which was in force.Provision would, of course, be made to ensure the erection of new houses by the local authority where necessary.It is probable that where a slum clearance scheme is linked up with other public improvements local authorities will deal with bad areas by purchase, but it is likely that there will be many cases, particularly of small areas,  in which they will prefer to secure demolition without being committed to the expense of purchase.6.    Default procedure.I propose to review the provisions with regard to default so as to ensure that they are adequate to deal with any failure on the part of looal authorities.    The&quot; exist infc, provisions&apos; will in any event need to be revised in the light of the changes In procedure which I have in mind,7.   Procedure after acquisition of,  or order for demolition of houses in,, an area.Under the existing statutory provisions practically every step taken by a looal authority
9 A 9offollowing the confirmation of a slum scheme has to be approved by the Minister of Health.    The Housing etc. Act, 1923, vprovi des for an Exchequer grant on a 60 per cent basis and the Exchequer interest in the proceedings of the local authority must be safeguarded by detailed and continuous control.   Every individual purchase of property (and the number of purchases in even a moderately sized scheme is frequently very large),   every disposal of property,  every proposal for lay out and building has to be financially approved in detail.   Moreover, the statute contemplates a grant not exceeding one half the estimated average annual loss likely to be incurred, which involves estimates of future income and expenditure which are extremely difficult to make and even more difficult to agree with the looal authorities.    The whole procedure is unsatisfactory and irritating to local authorities and it is just as necessary in the interests of simplification and progress to devise some automatic arrangement,  as it was in the oase of ordinary house building.Indeed,   If development on a considerable scale takes place,  it will be impossible to work the present system and the London County Council,  who have a large slum programme in operation, have pressed that steps should be taken to leave them a free hand and particularly, that grants should be made on some unit basis. 8&quot; Programme of Work,,I propose to take power to call upon local
9 A Aauthorities to submit at .an early date a programme of the work for the relief of slum conditions which they will put in hand^in the next five years and to provide that they shall be bound to prepare programmes in the future for similar periods:   in this connection I will consider whether they should not include in their programmes a statement of their general housing plans.    I should propose to approve from time to time, and in advance of slum clearance or other similar action, the provision of houses which 7/111 make such action practicable, and I should propose to link the special grants for slum work up with the provision of these houses and with the certification that actual clearance etc. has been done.9* Revised basis of Exchequer Assistance.A unit basis for a grant for slum work is essential if slum clearance is to be expedited and suoh a basis must take account primarily -(a) of the number of persons who are to be displaced&apos;,(b) of the fact that a proportion of the families to bedisplaced will not be able to pay a normal working class rent.It may be necessary to take account of some loss incurred In purchasing and disposing of property and to provide for an increased grant where local authorities themselves clear the area.    In the exceptional cases where it is necessary to use a cleared site for rehousing dispossessed persons allowance may also be required to be made for the increased loss which will be incurred in the case of land which will be more expensive than an ordinary housing site.It should not be difficult in negotiation with local authorities to arrive at a basis of grant which would
OA nO&apos; (j. Jenable local authorities to differentiate in the rents to be charged for houses provided in connection with their slum operations.   It is fairly generally accepted that a substantial proportion of the inhabitants of slums are unable to pay normal rents.    If it is assumed that this proportion is 50 per oent. and that the average rent whioh such persons are able to pay is 7/6d. a week inclusive of rates (or about 2/6d. to 3/-less than the average Wheatley inclusive rents for non-parlour houses), what is required is a basis of grant whioh would enable the local authority tc provide 50 per cent, of their slum replacement houses at Wheatley rents and 50 per cent, at rents whioh average 7/6d.To ensure that the grant is properly linked up with slum work and to encourage local authorities to devote themselves to this work, it will probably be most satisfactory to adopt persons displaced as the unit for grant.Whatever grant or grants may be provided should be subject to reconsideration at the same intervals and at the same time as the grant under the Housing Act, 1924, and it will probably be politic to extend the two years interval in that Act to three years.The arrangements would work somewhat on the following linesIt will first be necessary to settle in negotiation with the local authorities what the grant per person displaced is to be.local authorities will frame their slum programme let us say for the next 5 years. From time to time, say at intervals of eighteen months or two years, they will estimate
the number of people who will be displaced, by their various slum activities and they will apply for approval to provide, in advance? the number of houses necessary to enable, accommodation sufficient for the persons disp3.faced to be built.     The Minister of Health will approve the number and types of houses (which types should not be so restricted as in the case of the Wheatley scheme, for it should be possible for instance to provide small houses or tenements for old couples).   The approval will also be given subjeot to the condition that the speoial slum subsidy will only be available if, at the end of a certain period, the local authority can show that they have by their slum activities displaced persons to the number originally contemplated.     If they have not carried out their programme the houses will have to be treated as ordinary Part III houses for which only the Wheatley subsidy can be granted.I should also propose to make the new slum grant available as respects persons displaced by an ordinary closing and demolition order in respect of a house outside the slum area.As regards the fixing of rents it will be possible to give the local authority a considerable measure of freedom. They will not in any case be able to charge a higher rent than they normally charge for Wheatley houses and they will not be able to carry out their slum work unless they provide for low rents for the poorer persons in the slums.    It will in fact suffice to require that the total rent income from all the specially subsidised houses shall not be fixed higher than a figure which would bring out a deficit of, say, one and a half times
O 2 ry(or some other multiple of) the Exchequer subsidy.As to the method to be adopted as regards rent differentiation between different kinds of tenants, it will be well*to leave as much freedom as possible to the local authorities.     It will probably be found that some of the larger authorities will attach very great Importance to being free to fix the same&apos; nominal rent for houses for the same type and not to have different nominal rents for similar houses In the same street or on the same estate.     They will wish to make special allowances, or abatements, to particular occupiers and to vary these allowances from time to time and to use the additional assistance over and above normal housing subsidy which attaches to their slum work to cover these allowances. There should be no difficulty in giving them this freedom. 10. The advantages of the scheme which I have outlinedbroadly are, I believe, considerable.-     It will provide for a sustained attack on the problem.     Local authorities will be able to plan out their programmes in advance and go forward with the minimum of departmental Interference.     Thoy will have the advantage of increased Exchequer aid, which will be specially designed to put the authorities in a position to deal with the poorer inhabitants:    and I hope it may be possible in suitable cases to extend their work on a basis of reduced capital expenditure.The procedure will be simplified and shortened and the task of the local authorities made easier. 11. I have considered whether the new grant which I amsuggesting could not be extended to areas which are overcrowded and of slum character but not so bad as to warrant complete clearance.     There are practical difficulties In the way. Demolition is final, but unless there is demolition there is
no security that after the overcrowding has been abated in a semi-slum area, it will not recur;   there is the further difficulty of finding a definition for overcrowded semi-slum areas which will be administratively satisfactory.     The matter is still under consideration, and if a practicable method of meeting the difficulties can be found, I should propose to expand the scheme so as to provide for an attack on what I may call the second class slum and to extend the advantage of the new grant to the provision of houses for the accommodation of persons displaced from these overcrowded areas,12. In addition to this general scheme I should proposeto make a number of amendments to the law with a view to curing defects or shortening procedures     The most important of these is the shortening of the procedure for securing the closing and demolition of houses which are so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation and which cannot he made fit without reconstruction. 13. I should add that I propose also to take up withthe local authorities the question whether the provision of houses in the^rural districts, which proceeds slowly, cannot be expedited by bringing the County Councils to the assistance of the Rural District Councils to the extent of making a contribution from county rates in approved cases and on agreed lines to the expenditure of the latter bodies,, 14. I should be glad of the authority of my colleagues to proceed with the preparation of a Bill on the lines which I have indicated.(Intld.)    A.G.Ministry of Health.1st November, 1929.
