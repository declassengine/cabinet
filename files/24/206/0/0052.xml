THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1929.SECRET. Copy No.    3 fjCP. 305 (29).   &quot;CABINET.COMMITTEE ON  LONDON TRAFFIC.REPORT.Introductory.1. AT a meeting on the 25th September (Cabinet 35 (29), Conclusion 2) the Cabinet agreed that a Committee composed of the Minister of Transport (in the Chair), the Chancellor of the Exchequer (or representative), the President of the Board of Trade (or representative), and the Treasurer of the Household should explore the whole situation in regard to London Traffic, and report their conclusions to the Cabinet. The Chancellor of the Exchequer invited the Financial Secretary to the Treasury to represent him upon the Committee.2. The question before us was the situation arising as a result of the rejection by the House of Commons of the Bills promoted last Session by the London County Council and the Underground companies with the object of achieving a measure of co-ordination of the London passenger transport agencies controlled by them and by other parties who might subsequently adhere to the scheme set out in the Bills. The Cabinet will remember that these Bills were of an enabling character, and empowered the promoters to enter into an agreement for the formation of a Common Fund and the establishment of a scheme of common management covering the passenger transport agencies controlled by them. The principles embodied in the Bills were not acceptable to the Government, and the Minister of Transport, in advising their rejection, intimated that the Government regarded co-ordination as a necessity and the problem of London Traffic as one of great urgency, and promised that it should immediately be examined. He added that &quot; the Government fully accepts its responsibility in this urgent matter.&quot;3. The necessity for some measure bringing the various passenger transport undertakings of London under a common control, as regards both finance and management, is generally recognised. Only by such means can the economies to be gained by the elimination of wasteful competition be achieved, and an adequate margin of revenue be secured to finance and support the necessary developments in areas where facilities are at present inadequate. The London and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee were satisfied that, given a scheme such as they recom-mended for a pooling of resources and co-ordination of management, the transport undertakings concerned could be made self-supporting without any increase in the general level of fares now prevailing. It is important to bear in mind the high rate of earnings now achieved by the omnibuses, which enjoy the protection of the London Traffic Act, 1924, and that, while the London General Omnibus Company, under the Common Fund Agreement authorised in 1915, thus contributes to the financial support of the tubes, the profits of the independent omnibus proprietors make no contribution to the general problem.4. Much evidence as to the needs of the situation has been collected by the Advisory Committee, who, it will be remembered, recommended a scheme of
co-ordination in a report (known as the &quot;Blue Report&quot;) presented to the late Minister of Transport in 1927. We have not, therefore, thought it necessary to embark upon any further investigation, either as to the desirability of co-ordination or the benefits which may be expected to accrue therefrom to the public, but have confined our investigations to the problem how the desired end can best be achieved In conformity with the policy of the Government.5. We have met on three occasions, and have had before us a series of memoranda circulated by the Minister of Transport, in which the proportions of the problem and various alternative means of bringing the various traffic agencies under unified control have been placed before us. We have examined these, and have considered the merits and demerits of the alternative courses, and the scheme set out in broad outline in. Appendix I to this report represents the conclusions at which we have arrived.Area over which Co-ordination should be Secured.6. We have taken as the area of our investigations the London Traffic Area, as defined by the London Traffic Act, 1924, which extends, roughly, over a radius of 25 miles from Charing Cross, though its circumference is adjusted so as to have-regard to Local Government boundaries.7. By the Act, the Minister, after consultation with the Committee, exercises a variety of powers affecting the use of the streets throughout this area by all, or particular classes of, vehicles. The regulations made by the Minister are enforced by the police.8. In the Metropolitan Police district (an area covering a radius of roughly 15 miles from Charing Cross) power is also given to the Minister to prohibit or restrict omnibus services on routes where, by reason of the width of the streets or the density of traffic, of the existence of alternative facilities for travel or of excessive omnibus accommodation, he thinks such action is required.9. Within this narrower area the Commissioner of Police is the Licensing Authority. In the outer zone, between the 15-mile and 25-mile radius, the only licensing powers exercisable are those which attach, under the Town Police Clauses Acts, to urban authorities and such rural district councils as have obtained powers. Some of these authorities do not, in fact, exercise their jurisdiction with a view to restricting unnecessary competition.10. Within the Metropolitan Police District the Minister has exercised his powers so as to restrict the placing of additional omnibuses on the streets, and on some routes has effected an actual reduction of such services. One effect has been to confer a virtual monopoly upon the existing operators on the restricted routes.11. We have considered whether in any scheme of co-ordination passenger transport-agencies operating throughout the whole of this area should be included, or whether the area known as the Metropolitan Police District, which includes most of the thickly populated areas at present, would be a sufficiently wide area for co-ordinated operation. The Advisory Committee recommended in the Blue Report that no additional licences for public service vehicles should be issued by any licensing authority within the London Traffic Area, except with the consent of the Minister of Transport and on such terms and conditions as he might direct. We are of opinion that the sphere of operation of a co-ordinated authority should extend to the whole of the London Traffic area.   ;Undertakings to be brought within a Scheme of Co-ordination.12. Any comprehensive scheme for the co-ordination of public passenger transport facilities in London must take account of the following undertakings : (i.) The railways, omnibuses and tramways under the control of the Under-ground Electric Railway Companies of London, Ltd., generally known as &quot;The Combine&quot;; J-(ii.) The Metropolitan Railway; &apos;
(iii.) The tramways owned by the London County Council and other local authorities;(iv.) The suburban portions of railways belonging to the  &apos;&apos; Main Line &apos;&apos;companies; and (v.) Omnibuses owned by other proprietors.Position of Main Line Railways.13. With trfe exception of the &quot; Main Line&quot; railways, each of these groups of undertakings is concerned wholly or mainly with the provision of travelling facilities in the London Traffic area, We are impressed with the practical difficulties in the way of any attempt to bring the suburban services of the &quot; Main Line &quot; companies under a scheme of unified management, or to sever them from the remainder of the undertakings. Except in some few instances, the suburban lines are not physically distinct from the &quot;Main Lines,&quot; and it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to assess the amount of capital employed in connexion with, or the net revenue derived from, the suburban passenger traffic from that appropriate to main line traffic and goods traffic generally. It would obviously be impossible to earmark the expenditure, even if it could be estimated, against particular issues of capital. For these and other reasons the amalgamated railway companies, while generally taking the view that no scheme of co-ordination would be complete or satisfactory to which they themselves were not parties, made it clear that, in their view, it is not practicable for them to enter into a common fund and common manage-ment such as that envisaged by the Blue Report. The Report itself recommended that the Main Line companies should be empowered to enter into agreements with the constituent parties to the Common Fund or Common Manage-:merit for the routeing, exchange and clearance of traffic, the provision of through services, the pooling of receipts, and also for the leasing and/or working of any of the suburban&apos; lines. These powers were to be permissive in nature but not compulsory. &apos;&quot;&quot;&apos;&apos; 14. We are agreed that in existing circumstances these suburban lines could not be included in a scheme of common management, but &quot;that it is highly desirable that provision should be made in any such scheme to enable the Main Line companies to enter into working agreements, and possibly into some form of financial pool, in respect of their suburban traffic, with the co-ordinated undertaking. The railway companies will no doubt apprehend intensified competition from&quot; such a body and seek for some measure of protection against undue competition, and arrangements such as we propose seem to afford the most satisfactory means of holding a fair balance between the interests.15. We are of opinion that, with the foregoing exception, all the London passenger transport undertakings to which we have referred should be brought under a common management and control.Metropolitan Railway.16. The Metropolitan Railway Company has, in the past, inclined to rank itself as a &quot;Main Line &quot; rather than as a local London Railway. It carries a small freight traffic, is physically connected with all four amalgamated companies and jointly interested with two&apos; of them in sections of railway. We do not, however, think that it can be disputed that this company, not only in respect of its ownership of the northern arc of the Inner Circle Railway, but also of its suburban lines to Harrow and Uxbridge, is an integral part of London&apos;s system of transport, and we do not consider that it should be omitted from any scheme of co-ordination.17. Mention may also be made of the &quot; Surplus Lands Committee &quot; constituted under the Metropolitan Railway Companies Act of 1885 to take over surplus lands not required for railway purposes. The capital of this Committee consists of stock issued to the ordinary shareholders of the railway company, and this stock carries voting rights in the railway company.
&quot; Underground&quot; Group.18.. The group of undertakings generally known as the &quot; Combine &quot; comprises a considerable number and variety of undertakings under the control of a non-statutory company called &apos;&apos; The Underground Electric Railway Companies of London, Ltd.&quot; The control of this holding company over the various concerns is secured either by means of a majority holding in the share capital, or by the acquisition of voting rights without capital holdings in exchange for dividend guarantees. The most important elements in this combination are the four statutory electric railways, the Metropolitan District, London Electric, City &amp; South London and Central London Railways, together with the London General Omnibus Company. By the powers acquired by a private Act in 1915 these five, companies have entered into an agreement for the establishment of a Common Fund and common manage-ment, though the control of each of them is exercised directly by the holding company. Through the operation of this Common Fund these five companies may be regarded as in fact one undertaking.19. Apart from the Common Fund Companies, the Underground Conrpany controls a group of tramway companies, namely, the Metropolitan Electric Tramway Company, the London United Tramway Company and South Metropolitan Electric Tramways and Lighting Company. Control in these cases is secured through an interest in another holding company called the London and Suburban Traction Company.20. In addition to these major interests, the holding company controls, or has an interest in, a variety of minor enterprises, either by direct holdings or through the holdings of its subsidiary companies. For example, the London General Omnibus Company owns or controls certain other omnibus companies, some of which operate in the London Traffic Area, while others operate wholly or partly outside that area. The holding company, together with the Metropolitan Electric Tramways Company, has a holding in the North Metropolitan Electricity and Power Company. The holding company also owns the Associated Equipment Company, which is concerned with the manufacture of road vehicles. Another side of the activities of the group is represented by the Union Surplus Lands Company, owned by the holding company. This is not an exhaustive catalogue of the varied and widespread interests of the group, but suffices to show that its activities are not confined to London passenger transport. The extent to which these extraneous interests should be included within the ambit of co-ordination will be a matter for consideration in detail.Local Authorities&apos; Tramways.21. The undertakings owned by local authorities in the area comprise the tramways of the London County Council and of 12 other local authorities, some of which work their tramways themselves, while others have entered into leasing or working arrangements with other operators. The financial circumstances of the different undertakings in this category vary widely, as may be seen from the Table in Appendix II attached.Other Omnibus Undertakings.22.- As regards other omnibus proprietors in the area, we find that there are, in addition to the London General Omnibus Company and its controlled subsidiaries, certain undertakings which, while not controlled by the London General Omnibus Company, work in association with that Company, or have financial connections with it. These companies, which include Tillings, the British Automobile Traction Company and the National Omnibus and Transport Company, operate to a large extent outside the London Traffic area, and, indeed, in parts of the country remote from London. It may be necessary to buy out the interests of these companies in London Traffic.23. Apart from these companies, there are 57 independent omnibus proprietors owning amongst them some 250 buses, who are licensed to run on restricted streets in the Metropolitan Police area. The bringing of these concerns within a scheme of co-ordination presents a special problem. No particulars are available as to their financial position, but we understand that some of them are
highly profitable. We may add that over and above these regular omnibus services, which are subject to the jurisdiction of the Minister of Transport under the London Traffic Act, there are certain omnibus services plying outside the Metropolitan Police area but within the London Traffic area, and therefore at present outside the jurisdiction of the Minister. There are also services of the nature of char-a-lancaster services which run regularly between two places within the London traffic area. These are not omnibus services in the ordinary sense, since they do not ply for hire upon the streets, and do not, therefore, come within the jurisdiction of the Minister under the London ^Traffic Act. We think that account will have to be taken of services of this nature if any monopoly of passenger-carrying services is to be set up in the London Traffic area.The Blue Report.24. We have already referred to the proposals made by the London and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee in the Blue Report. That report, which was dated July 1927, represented a compromise between a wide range of views. It was signed by the representatives of the transport workers, by representatives of the London County Council and other local authorities in the area, and of the Underground Group. Only the representatives of the independent omnibus proprietors dissented, although Sir Herbert Walker, on behalf of the &quot; Main Line &quot;. railway companies, did not sign the report, as he considered it necessary that the interests which he represented should retain a free hand in the matter. The solution propounded by the Committee was, however, not acceptable to the Labour Party in the Greater London area.The scheme of the Blue Report may be summarised as one for a &quot; Common Fund &quot; and &quot; Common Management,&quot; subject to overriding control by the Minister of Transport,&quot; but without change of ownership.Common Fund.25. The revenues of the Underground group of railways, omnibuses and tramway companies, the Metropolitan Railway Company and the municipally-owned tramways in the London traffic area were, after meeting working expenses and certain other prior charges, to be paid into a &quot; Common Fund.&quot; The Fund was to be distributed among the parties as follows : Firstly, to make good.any revenue deficiencies of any of the parties. Secondly, in proportion to the amounts which the several parties would have paid to the fund in a standard year. Thirdly, to make up the return on the capital remunerated from the &quot; Common Fund,&quot; viz., the ordinary share capital of the companies and the whole or a proportion of the municipal capital, until the return is alike for all parties. Fourthly, in proportion to the capital of the several parties until a reasonable return is reached. Any balance remaining in the &quot;Common Fund&quot; after payment of a reasonable return on the capital employed was to be used for any of the following purposes :  (a.) To provide a credit to attract new capital.(b.) To carry out improvements to the existing undertakings.(c.) To reduce fares and other charges.(d.) To provide a general reserve against possible future bad years. (e.) To finance temporarily new capital expenditure.(/.) Such other purposes as may be approved by the Minister of Transport.Common Management.26. There was to be a Common Management, consisting of one or more persons, appointed by and responsible to the proprietors of the several undertakings, but the Committee thought that this would only be practicable by agreement.&apos; Public Control.27. Public control was to be secured through the Minister of Transport, acting on the advice of the Committee, so as to ensure a programme of expansion and development, proper scales of fares, adequate services and sound financial arrange-ments for raising new capital. The Minister was also to settle any differences arising between the Common Management and the constituent parties, or any of them, or between the constituent parties themselves or between the Common
Management or any of the constituent parties, on the one hand, and other public passenger transport agencies in the London area, on the other, e.g.% the Main Line Railway Companies.Duration.28. The scheme was to continue in operation for a minimum period of 42 years and be subject to revision or variation only by general consent of the parties. It was to be terminated only by the substitution of some fresh scheme affording at least equal security and protection to the undertakers and the public, or by acquisition and amalgamation of all the undertakings by some authority created by Parliament or by their transfer to municipal or national ownership.Objections to the Scheme of the Blue Report.29. The scheme was admittedly tentative and incomplete, since the Committee felt unable to proceed with the further consideration of details until assured that the Government would be prepared in principle to support a solution on these lines. If such an assurance were forthcoming the Committee would no doubt seek a solution of a number of difficulties and ambiguities which are apparent in the scheme so far as they had worked it out. In certain respects, notably the financial arrangements, the position of the Common Management and the proposed public control by the Minister, considerable difficulties obviously arise, to which a satisfactory solution does not readily present itself. The primary question to which we have addressed ourselves is, however, whether the principles underlying these proposals can be accepted consistently with the policy of the present Government. Leaving aside, therefore, matters of detail and the important question of the return to be allowed upon existing capital, including the application of surplus earnings, we find four fundamental objections to a solution of the problem along the lines suggested in the Blue Report : (i.) A Common Fund without Common Management would be of little use, and we consider that the latter should be a compulsory feature of any scheme of co-ordination of the interests concerned. Even if the Common Management were achieved, its opportunities for economies and development would be likely to be hampered by the continued existence of a number of separate owners, wdiose interests it would have to reconcile and to whom it would be responsible.(ii.) A Common Management, such as the Committee vaguely envisage, would, if secured, almost certainly be in the hands of the Companies as the predominant partners. It must, therefore, in practice mean the management of the publicly-owned tramways by the Company organisation. We doubt whether it would be possible to meet this objection if any such scheme as the Committee proposed were adopted.(iii.) The position of the Minister, with apparently wide powers of direction and control, but without power to assume financial responsibility, does not seem to us to be capable of satisfactory reconciliation with the retention of private ownership, and we doubt if in practice he would be able effectively to exercise his powers against the views of the individual constituents of the co-ordinated management. In that case the interests of the travelling public might not be sufficiently safeguarded.The suggestion that disputes should be submitted to the Minister to settle with the help of the Advisory Committee, or referred to arbitration, is of doubtful practicability ami might result in friction, (iv.) We think that any such scheme, if once adopted, would be difficult to reverse, at any rate within the 42 years contemplated by the Committee. This would mean postponement for that period of the full public control which we think essential, and the complete public ownership which we-think at least highly desirable.It does not appear that these fundamental objections to the scheme of the Blue Report could be met, consistently with adherence to the principles on which it is based, and in particular the principle of non-disturbance of ownership. We are, therefore, of opinion that the foundation of any scheme for the co-ordination of London passenger transport agencies should be their transference to public ownership.
Alternative of Leasing.30. As a compromise between the principles of private and public ownership .we have considered the possibility of providing for a compulsory lease of the undertakings to a single operating authority. By this means common management could no dount be made a reality, but the fact that at the end of the lease the owning bodies would be entitled to resume possession would tend to hamper the lessee body in its efforts to achieve economies and developments, as it would be difficult to scrap or alter the character of leased undertakings. The position of the lessees as regards the raising of additional capital would suffer from the fact that they could not mortgage the property of the undertakings. In practice it would seem inevitable that provision would have to be made to buy out the owners at the end of the lease so that the transaction would in fact resolve itself into a. deferred purchase.Acquisition by a Public Body.31. We consider that the only practicable alternative to the scheme of the Blue Report is some form of acquisition by purchase by a public authority. The total nominal capital of the companies concerned is about  92,000,000, of which the Underground &quot;Common Fund&quot; Companies represent  62.500,000, the Tramway Companies  4,500,000 and the Metropolitan Railway Company  25,000,000. The total capital raised in respect of local authorities&apos; tramways is over  23,000,000 and the outstanding debt on these tramwavs not redeemed or provided for is  11,000,000.32. We are of opinion that if the Cabinet approves in principle of the plan outlined in this report it will be necessary, before the Government is committed to its adoption, that one or two chartered accountants of high standing and experience should be requested to report upon the financial aspects of the scheme, and in particular as to the alternative bases of ascertaining the values of the under-takings, the relative advantages of purchase by an exchange of stock or by a system of payments spread over a term of years, and the various intricate questions which may be encountered in connexion with the proposed acquisition and to recommend a basis or alternative bases on which negotiations might be opened.33. In this connexion it is important to bear in mind the following provisions included in the London Traffic Act, 1924 : Protection of Public Interests.13. (1.) It is hereby declared that nothing in this Act is to be treated as conferring on any omnibus proprietor any right to the continuance of any benefits arising from the grant of licences, or from any conditions attached to licences, or from any orders, schedules or regulations for the time being in force under this Act.(2.) In the event of any undertaking providing means of transport within the London Traffic Area being purchased compulsorily by any local or public authority, that part of the value of the undertaking attributable directly or indirectly to this Act, or to any orders, schedules or regulations made thereunder, shall not be taken into account.34. We have already referred to the opinion of the London and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee that on the basis of a scheme of pooling of resources and co-ordination of management such as they recommended, the transport under-takings concerned could be made self-supporting without any increase in the present general level of fares. The public authority which we contemplate should, if the undertakings are taken over on reasonable terms, and having regard to the economies to be achieved by a unified management, be able to finance the acquisition and operation of the co-ordinated undertakings without assistance from the Exchequer or from the local ratepayers. We do not, therefore, contemplate the necessity for any general Government guarantee of securities issued by the new body in respect of the purchase price. It must, however, be remembered that about  12,500,000 of the debenture capital of the &quot; Combine &quot; railways was issued under Government guarantees both as to principal and interest given under the Trade Facilities Acts,
and the position of these issues would in any case have to be safeguarded. Regard should be had to these considerations in framing the reference to the accountants proposed in paragraph 32.Possibility of Obtaining Control by Acquisition of a Controlling Interest Only.35. It has been suggested that public control of the undertakings comprising M the combine could be achieved by simply acquiring (1) the holding Company, which has a total nominal capital of  16,500,000, or (2) a majority of the voting rights in each of the operating companies. We have examined these suggestions, but we find serious objections to their adoption. It is true that the Underground Company has itself acquired control by acquisition of a majority of the voting rights and without disturbing the prior ranking capital, but it has done this by purchase on the market or by bargain with the ordinary stockholders. It would be a different matter for a public authority to step in and acquire control by compulsion, while leaving the remaining shareholders in a permanent minority and without any effective voice in deciding the policies of the Companies. Among other difficulties and objections likely to be encountered would be the status of any new capital raised after control was obtained, the problem of how to secure the transfer of voting rights acquired by the holding company from individual shareholders in return for a guarantee of dividend and the hampering effect of the perpetuation of the existing organisations with all their complications upon, the efforts of the public authority to secure economies and to co-ordinate and provide additional facilities.36. The co-ordination of passenger transport agencies in Berlin, recently achieved by the formation of a company, in which the whole of the capital is owned by the Municipality, to take over the transport undertakings from the existing companies, which were to be liquidated, was no doubt rendered possible by the fact that the Municipality had, over a course of years, already acquired a majority of the shares of the various concerns, and a solution along these lines does not appear to be appropriate or practicable in the circumstances in which the London problem has now to be approached.Outright Acquisition.37. We have therefore come definitely to the conclusion that there should be a complete acquisition of the undertakings concerned by a public authority. We hesitate at this stage to hazard an estimate of the probable cost of such acquisition, but whether it were achieved by purchase outright through an exchange of stocks or by some form of terminable annuity, it should not be necessary to raise any considerable amount of new capital. When the London Docks were transferred . from the old Dock Companies to the Port of London Authority by the Act of 1908. the former method was adopted, after an exhaustive investigation of the financial position of the undertakings by Sir William Plender and of their physical condition by a member of the firm of Sir John Wolfe Barry and Partners. In that case the basis of valuation adopted appears to have been the average of the net receipts over a period of six years. The circumstances in which the docks were acquired were, however, very different from those of the London passenger transport agencies to-day. The docks had at that time reached a position in which no further development of their trade was possible without considerable capital expenditure which the Companies were quite unable to carry out, whereas the London transport companies have on the whole shown considerable capacity for expansion.Basis of Transfer of Local A uthoriti.es&apos; Tramways.38. We propose that the local authorities&apos; tramways should be transferred on the basis that the new. authority would assume responsibility for all outstanding-debt charges and other liabilities of the undertakings and Avould take over their assets. The financial circumstances of the different undertakings vary considerably, but it is apparent that any purchase on the basis of net revenue earned would mean that, with a few exceptions, the local authorities concerned would have to levy a rate for tramway purposes for several years after the transfer of ownership (see Appendix II). We do not think that the Councils owning the more prosperous undertakings should seek to reap a profit from the transfer, particularly as such
measure of prosperity as they enjoy is doubtless due to protection which they have enjoyed under the London Traffic Act. The basis of transfer which we propose would mean that the new authority would assume responsibility to the local authorities for approximately  1,000,000 a year, but this sum would diminish as the debt was redeemed.Independent Omnibus Undertakings.39. The basis of acquisition of the omnibus undertakings outside the Combine would require special consideration. It is known that many of these undertakings have enjoyed abnormally high profits during recent years, and the basis of net revenue without modification would result in compensation at unduly inflated rates. In this connexion it may be necessary to invoke the provisions of Section 13 of the London Traffic Act, already quoted. These undertakings represent in any case a relatively small element in the problem, though their acquisition may perhaps present some political difficulties. Some of them would probably have to be bought out in cash at a price which might, in default of agreement, be left to arbitration.Composition and Functions op proposed Traffic Authority.40. There remains the question of the status and composition of the proposed new traffic authority. Three alternative types of authority suggest themselves for consideration, namely :  (a.) A joint municipal authority.(6.) An authority consisting of representatives of various interests, (c.) A business board.41. We feel bound to assume that the creation of a Greater London Authority which would exercise all the functions of local government over the area of Greater London, including traffic operation, is unlikely in the immediate future. If and when such an authority is created, it may be found expedient to merge any ad hoc traffic authority in it,A Joint Municipal Authority.42. As an arrangement ad interim, the Labour Party in London has urged the creation of a joint municipal traffic authority. On such a body representation would have to be given to the London County Council and other County Councils concerned, and to County and (possibly) Metropolitan boroughs, though there would seem to be no reason for giving special representation to local authorities qua tramway owners. Such a body would have the advantage of providing automatically for a full representation of public interests as distinct from the technical and professional elements of management, but, in order to prevent the body becoming unwieldy, a scheme of indirect representation of the authorities would have to be elaborated. Such schemes do not always give satisfaction, and cannot be guaranteed to attract the best municipal ability. Furthermore, it may be doubted whether a Board of Management constituted entirety of municipal representatives or of such repre-sentatives, together, with certain nominees of the Government, working under the conditions of formality, debate and delay inseparable from such a body, would have a fair opportunity of applying to the daily task of transporting the enormous population of London with celerity and comfort the effective business direction for which that task calls.A Repn-esentative Body.43. The objections which we feel may be urged against a joint municipal traffic authority also apply to an authority constituted of representatives of the public and other interests specially, concerned, such as labour employed in the industry, other transport interests in the area and various Government Departments. We doubt whether a body so constituted could be expected to produce the best results in dealing with the highly technical and sensitive business of passenger transport.
Conclusions.46.   Our conclusions may be summarised as follows : (1.) There is an Urgent need for a wide measure of co-ordination of the undertakings engaged in passenger transport in the London Traffic Area. Under any such scheme the railway, omnibus, and tramway undertakings of local authorities in the area, and other omnibus undertakings operating therein, must be brought under a co-ordinated management based upon a pooling of resources. In existing circumstances there would be great difficulty in bringing the Amalgamated Railway Companies, in respect of their suburban lines, into any scheme involving a common fund and a common management, and still greater difficulty in transferring their interest in those lines to a new and separate ownership. These Companies should, however, be enabled to enter into working and other arrangements with the co-ordinated undertaking in respect of their London suburban lines, and it would also be necessary to consider what additional machinery might be desirable to prevent wasteful or unfair competition between the railways of the amalgamated companies and the new undertakings.(2.) We see certain fundamental objections to the adoption of proposals on the lines of those set out in the Blue Report.(3.) We are also unable, for the reasons given in this Report, to recommend a scheme of leases to a public body or the acquisition by such a body of controlling interests, short of complete ownership.(4.) We are of opinion that the needs of the situation can best be met, in conformity with the policy of the Government, through the purchase of the &quot; Combine &quot; undertakings, the Metropolitan Railway and the other omnibus undertakings by a public body to be created by legislation.(5.) If a scheme on the lines set out in the Appendix to this Report is approved in principle, we recommend that one or two eminent Accountants (selected by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Transport) should be asked toA Business Board.44. In the interests of efficient operation, we favour the third alternative, namely, a small board of business men of proved capacity. &quot;We have in mind a body somewhat - similar to the Central Electricity Board, which is appointed by the Minister of Transport, and consists of a Chairman and seven members selected after consultation with interests representing Local Government, Electricity, Commerce, Industry, Transport, Agriculture and Labour, but we should prefer to avoid any such scheme of representation as is thiis indicated, and also any statutory obligation to consult with particular interests. &quot;We suggest that the Board should consist of not more than seven members appointed by the Minister of Transport. The Chairman and Vice-Chairman at least should be appointed on a full time basis, and should be paid salaries substantial enough to command men of the highest business ability and experience. We realise, however, that it may be necessary to provide among the other members of the Board for some representation of public interests, including those of Local Government.Relationship to Central Government.45. As regards the relationship of this body to the Central Government, we do not consider that it should be subject to interference in the ordinary management of the combined undertaking. It would no doubt be provided in the necessary legislation that the fares and charges to be made to the public should be such as to meet all the expenses of the Board, but there would probably have to be some machinery for enabling public opinion to be expressed in regard to the level of charges for particular services, and to the provision of new facilities and developments. Some supervision should be exercised by the Minister of Transport over large matters of policy and the financial arrangements of the Board, e.g., by sanction of new borrowings, prescription of the form of accounts, &amp;c, while its operations would, of course, be subject to the ordinary law and to the powers of the Minister for the regulation of traffic.
advise the Government in the following circumstances. On the assumptions (a) that the Company-owned undertakings are to.be purchased by a public or quasi-public body, and (b) that no Exchequer guarantee should be envisaged except so far as necessary to safeguard the position of existing capital already covered by such a guarantee, but that, subject to any steps rendered necessary by the existence of such guarantee, the new authority should be financially self-supporting : (i.) On what basis should the price be negotiated, i.e., on a basis of net revenue or on market prices so far as ascertainable, or on a combination of both or otherwise?(ii.) Would the most favourable method of financing such a transaction be by issue of substituted stock or by terminable annuities, or otherwise, regard being had to the probable financial resources of the purchasing body ?(iii.) Generally in the matter.(6.) The tramways of the local authorities should be transferred to the public body mentioned in paragraph (4) on the basis that it would assume responsibility for all outstanding debt charges and other liabilities of the undertakings.(7.) The body to be charged with the acquisition and subsequent management of the co-ordinated undertakings should be a small business board, consisting of not more than seven members to be appointed by the Minister of Transport.Signed on behalf of the Committee, HERBERT MORRISON, Chairman.32, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, November 7, 1929.1.20111 ID
APPENDIX I.OUTLINE OF SCHEME OF TRANSFERENCE OF LONDON PASSENGER TRANSPORT UNDERTAKINGS TO A COMMON public ownership.Creation of a London Traffic Authority.1. Promotion of a Government Bill to provide for the creation of a London Traffic Authority, and for the purchase by such authority of the following London passenger transport undertakings :  (a.) The railway, omnibus and tramway undertakings operating in the London Traffic area comprised in the group of undertakings controlled by the Underground Electric Railway Companies of London, Ltd.(&amp;.) The Metropolitan Railway.(c.) The tramway undertakings of local authorities within the London Traffic Area.(d.) Other omnibus undertakings operating within the London Traffic Area.Note. Further investigation will be necessary as to the practica-bility of purchasing the above undertakings without at the same time acquiring extraneous interests with which they are financially or contractually connected.Constitution and Functions of the Authority.2. The new authority to be a public body, not trading for profit, and to be charged with the management, operation and maintenance as one undertaking of the various undertakings taken over and the provision of further facilities for passenger travel in the London Traffic Area. It should be composed of not more than seven members, appointed by the Minister of Transport, of whom the Chairman and Vice-Chairman at least should be appointed on a full-time basis and should be paid salaries accordingly.Terms of Purchase.3. These should be laid down in the Bill. The basis on. which the values of the company-owned undertakings to be transferred should be assessed and the method of payment of the purchase price, together with other financial aspects of the pro-posals, should be reported upon by one or two eminent accountants as soon as practicable. When these reports have been received and considered, the Minister of Transport should be authorised to enter into negotiations with the interests concerned on a basis to be approved by the Cabinet.The tramways undertakings of the local authorities should be transferred on the basis that the new authority would assume responsibility for all outstanding debt charges and other liabilities of the undertakings and take over all their assets.Financial Powers of the Authority.4. In the event of it being decided to purchase the undertakings by an exchange of stocks, the authorising Act should confer on the new authority power to issue the necessary &quot; traffic stock &apos;&apos; in exchange for the existing stock of the undertakings, which should be cancelled. It should also empower the authority to raise new capital as required for any of the following purposes :-(a.) Purchase of any undertaking for which it may be necessary to pay cash. (b.) Working capital.(c.) The development and expansion of passenger transport facilities in the - London Traffic Area.
The issue of further stock for the purpose (c) above and the terms and conditions of its issue should be subject to the approval of the Minister of Transport.Position of the Main Line Railway Companies.5. These will remain outside the co-ordinated undertaking, but powers should be conferred enabling agreements to be entered into for working, pooling of receipts and also for the leasing ^of any of the suburban lines. The Main Line Railway Companies will no doubt ask for some measure of protection against intensified corn-petition.It would also be desirable that the new authority should have power to enter into working agreements with passenger transport undertakings operating outside the London Traffic Area so as to enable through services to be provided.Public Control, Fares, Facilities, &amp;c.6. A variety of conditions,govern the charging powers of the existing under-takings, and it may be convenient that the Act authorising their transfer to a single body should repeal the existing powers and bring all the undertakings under some one form of control as regards fares and charges. In the case of the Metropolitan Railway Company, which is subject to a schedule of standard charges applied to it by the Railway Rates Tribunal pursuant to the Railways Act, 1921, some modifica-tion of the existing machinery of control seems an essential consequence of the inclusion of the railway in the scheme of co-ordination. In view of the varied nature of the undertakings to be included, it might be advisable that the fares to be charged should be subject to maximum scales approved by the Minister of Transport, and to subsequent revisions by him, upwards or downwards, on application by the authority itself or by any local authority in the area.It might also be necessary to provide some machinery for enabling public opinion to be expressed in regard to the adequacy of existing, or the provision of new, facilities, or the desirability of developments, and here also the appropriate procedure seems to be by representation by local authorities to the Minister.The accounts of the Authority should be kept in a form prescribed by the Minister, and the auditor should be appointed by him. The authority should also be put under obligation to furnish the Minister with such statistical and financial information as he may from time to time require, and to present to him an annual report, which he in turn should present to Parliament.Amendment of the London Traffic Act.7. The London Traffic Act is a temporary measure, and we consider that it will be necessary to re-enact it, but with such modifications as the existence of the Traffic Authority and experience of the working of the Act render advisable. In particular, we consider that, if an effective monopoly, apart from the Main Line Railways, of public passenger transport within the London Traffic Area is to be conferred on the new body, it will be necessary to extend to the whole area the powers of the Minister in relation to the regulation of the operation of omnibuses and the fares charged thereon, which are at present exercisable only within the Metropolitan Police District, and to enlarge those powers so as to give him effective control over the licensing of public service vehicles throughout the area.
