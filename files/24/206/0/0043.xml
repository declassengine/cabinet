DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJBSTYrS GOVERNMENT)INTERIM REPORT OF INDUSTRIAL TRANSFERENCE COMMITTEE.The Industrial Transference Committee was appointed by the Cabinet to consider the question of transferred labour (Cabinet 40 (29) Conclusion 2).     We understand that we were asked specifically to consider -(1) the provision Thereby grants made to Local Authorities in non-depressed areas are dependent upon the employment of a percentage of men from the depressed areas;(2) the transfer of men from the depressed areas to employment in other areas. &apos;We have held two meetings and examined both the arrangements and facilities for transference and the terms and  conditions of assistance from the Unemployment Grants Committee, the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Agriculture, from the standpoint of -(a) the needs of the transference policy and(b) the attitude of Local Authorities.We are unanimously of opinion that the-policy of industrial transference is necessary and should,in some amended form, be continued.As a result of our discussion we incline to the following views;-C R E T,295 (29).CAB I N E T.
mi1. -as far ae possible men transferred from depressed areas should be employed on national schemes of work.&apos;  2,    In the case of Local Authorities with an average rate of unemployment of from 6&apos; to 10 per cent, the percentage of transferred men should not be rigidly fixed as a condition for the receipt of a grant.3,    The percentage of transferred men to be employed on Looal Authorities&apos; schemes in suoh oases should be a matter for negotiation with the Local Authority concerned having regard to looal conditions, with a view to introducing a greater degree of elasticity into the scheme.-These must not be regarded as our final views. Before discussing the matter further and coming to definite conclusions we ask -(l) that the Lord Privy Seal should be added to the Committee; and further,(2) that we should have clear directions whether or not this Committee is to consider the general policy of the Government oh schemes for providing employment.Signed on behalf of the Committee.
