(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANJIIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).SECRET. COPY NO:___,J__C.P.251 (29)..0 A B I N E T:. LONDON TRAFFIC. Memorandum by the Minister of .T ran snorts1. It is necessary that the Government should at an earlydate cone to some conclusion as to the lines upon which it is prepared to handle the London Traffic problenw      The matter is one of urgency not only upon the merits of the case but because uncertainty as to the position may react unfavourably upon the inception of schemes which would provide substantial employment.2. The London Traffic Act of 1 922f gave power to theMinister of Transport to restrict the number of omnibuses plying for hire on selected streets in the Metropolitan Police area, By the action of my predecessor the&apos; position was stabilised and regulations were made providing for an actual reduction in the number of omnibuses plying for hire on certain routes. Simultaneously the Combine has by agreement purchased many of the omnibuses in other ownership with the result that at the present time there remain only 57 &quot;independent&quot; omnibus proprietors owning among them 2^0 omnibuses out of the total of nearly 5,000 running in the area*3* Although no financial particulars are available, It isa matter of common knowledge that some of these businesses are very profitable and that the London General Omnibus Company when purchasing similar businesses paid sums substantially in excess of the value of the omnibuses and other visible assets taken over. The extent to v/hich the earnings of the omnibuses in the Combine contribute to maintain the tube railways under the present Common Fund agreement is not known, but it is undoubtedly substantial. The existing independent proprietors, however, retain the whole of their high xorofits without making any contribution to the maintenance of the less profitable branches of London transport.
It is generally admitted that the earnings of the traffic as a whole would, if pooled, suffice to provide necessary new facilities and developments.      On the other hand, Lord Ashfield has always made it clear that the interests for which he is responsible would not be prepared to embark upon further substantial expenditure under the limited measure of protection afforded by the London Traffic Act.      In the first place, that Act is temporary in duration and in the next place the policy of restricting licences to ply for hire to existing proprietors Is subject to modification or reversal by administrative action. Nevertheless, the restrictions we are imposing under the London Traffic Act are in reality conferring without payment a not entirely complete, but valuable-  omnibus monopoly upon those already engaged in the business,4,       In intimating to the leaders of the London County Council and to Lord Ashfield our decision that the Bills promoted last  session would not be allowed to proceed, I stated, upon the authority of the Prime Minister,  that I should be ready at an early date to explore with all the Interests concerned the best means of resuming consideration of a problem which the G-overnment itself recognised to be urgent.     The conversation did not lead me to expect that either of the parties would take the initiative in proposing any modified or new solutions     What then are the alternative courses which it is open to us to pursue?5,        (1)    We cannot proposo or support further Bills of amerely enabling characterc      In minor directions it might be possible to strengthen control over the nature of the agreements to be concluded and the way in which they should be carried out,      It might also -be possible to arrange for Local Authorities to provide part of the new capital required but I see
ll7no means of meeting the fundamental points of principle which I urged in the course of opjjosition to the recent Bills since under any arrangement on these lines the management of the municipally owned tramways would in my opinion effectively he in the hands of the Combine. (2)    The next course which suggests   itself is to adopt in principle and to elaborate the recommendations of the London and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee, known as the &quot;Blue Report&quot;.      These recommendations are based on the establishment of a Common Fund and a Common Management into which the Underground Group (Tubes, Omnibuses and Tramways),  the municipally owned tramways, the independently owned omnibuses and the Metropolitan Railway, which is a distinct and autonomous railway unit, would be compelled to enter. Special questions arise in connection with the main line railway companies.      If a public Bill were promoted on these lines, it would probably be . necessary to provide for the establishment of a competent tribunal to approve and, if necessary, to prescribe the terms upon which each of the constituent parties were to participate in the Common Fund and to give the tribunal fairly clear directions as to the basis upon which such terms were to be settled.      The constitution and functions of the common management would also have to be settled and the extent to which it would be subjected to public control.     The general conception of the Blue Report was that the Minister, on the advice of the Traffic Advisory Committee would be able to issue orders to the Common
Management and the various constituents of the co-ordinated undertaking, requiring- them to carry-out improvements and to provide new facilities within the limits of the financial resources of the Pool.      The Blue Report avoided the establishment of any new authority and any change in the ownership of existing undertakings (except the contemplated absorption of the independent omnibus proprietors).      There might be some difficulty in securing developments by the owners of constituent undertakings, whether municipal or private, at the behest of a controlling authority which itself had no financial responsibility, and reliance would have to be placed on the probable existence of surplus earnings, and the assistance which might be derived from the provision or guarantee of new capital by the Local Authorities. So long as the present ownerships remain, it would be difficult to avoid the predominance of private capital on the common management and such a scheme could hardly be temporary in character!    the Blue Report itself contemplated a minimum period of 1+2 years.      In any case such a policy would involve considerable political difficulties as the Blue Report was not acceptable to the London Labour M.P. &apos;s,   the L.G.-G. Labour Party and the London Labour Party.)    The third solution would be to assert at once the principle of public ownership and to transfer to some new joint authority, board or commission the ownership and operation of all the existing undertakingsboth private and municipal.      This
would raise a great variety of important financial and other questions and a first-class political issue, I do not at tiiis stage desire to discuss the various forms which such a &quot;body might assume or the alternative financial bases of acquisition.     The solution which the London Labour Party has advocated in the past is the establishment of a new joint municipal traffic authority consisting of the Comity and County Borough Councils In the London Traffic area.      If ever the reform of the local government of Greater London were taken in hand, the Greater London Authority should probably be placed in charge of traffic operation and any solution now proposed should be without prejudice to that eventual policy,      I am not, however, altogether convinced that as an iiimiediate step the creation of a joint municipal traffic authority would be the most suitable and efficient means of handling this particular problem.     Under any scheme a full right of making representation upon all matters of local interest would have to be  secured to the Metropolitan Boroughs and other Municipal Authorities, but. their direct presence on the governing body might involve a cumbersome administration,      I should, therefore, prefer to contemplate the establishment of a body more on the lines of the Central Electricity Board,  or the British Broadcasting Gorporation, with a somewhat similar relationship to the Minister of Transport and Parliament. 6,       As I have said, proposals on these lines would raise political issues of substance and important questions of public finance.     Before I give them any detailed examination,  I should like to know whether my colleagues would be prep.ared, in principle, to take into consideration proposals of such a character involving
20th September,  1929.legislation in the present Parliament. I should welcome the appointment of a small Cabinet Committee to explore the whole situation,(Intld.)    HUM.
