4 (29)i 1is ^he^Pr^perty^of Hi^s^Eritannlo^ Ma jesty^s^^jrover^nment)/COPY NO.^cabinet general STOPPAGE OP 1926.Position of H.M.Office of Works1 Employees who took partMemorandum by the First Commissioner of Works.I have reoeived representations from the Trade Union Side of the Departmental Joint Industrial Council and from the General Seoretary of the Transport and General Workers * Union, on the subject of oertaln disabilities under which some of the direct employees of His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works labour In consequence of instructions which were issued at the oonolusion of the stoppage, tb the effect that men who had remained at work or who had returned to work before the end of the stoppage should be given seniority over all those who had participated in the dispute.So far as the direct employees of the Department are oonoemed, certain grades of men were not affeoted by the stoppage, but of those grades who were concerned 624 men remained out for the whole of the period and 599 did not participate.    In normal circumstances, it is the rule of the Department, when staff is being reduced owing to reduction of work, to discharge the Junior men in the grade concerned^ unlesB there are others who by reason of age or physical disability are considered unable to give effective service. The result of the instruction, therefore, was to give a privileged position to those who had remained at work and virtually to assure them of continuous employment,As since 1926 there nave been few discharges owing to reduction of work, such discharges as have been made have been for
for reasons of age or disability and the Department has not been called upon to implement the Instructions of the Government of that day.   The time will undoubtedly arrive, however, when reductions must be made on the basis of Juniority and I would propose to restore the men who took part in the stoppage to their positions On,the seniority lists which they occupied prior to May 1926.The question of the employees of Messrs. Mowlem, under the London Maintenance Contract, presents a different problem. The Contractors insisted that the men who had served the firm both on Government and other work during the stoppage should be placed at the head of the seniority lists and that all other workmen who were re-engaged after the end of the dispute should take common seniority from that date.    I do not think the   -Department can Interfere with the Contractor In such a matter, and I understand that the Trade Unions concerned realise that they should negotiate directly with the Contractor on this matter.G.L.8th October, 1929.
