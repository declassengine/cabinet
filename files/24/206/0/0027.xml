HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT -EC RET. COPY NO. 0 X.P.278*29) CABINET.Food policy and the protection of the consumer: Trustsand Combines .Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1.    I wish to bring before the Cabinet the inter-related questions of food policy, the protection of the consumer in regard to the necessities of life, and the action to be taken to deal with trusts and combines.    In regard to food the only official body now concerned with the interests of the consumer is the Pood C council which was established in 1925 by the last Government for the purpose of investigating and reporting on questions relating to the supply or price (not production) of articles of food of general consumption.      The Food Council was not set up by Act of Parliament and possesses no powers to compel the furnishing of information, or to control food supplies or prices.      (See Annex I for terms of reference). During the summer I was asked in the House of Commons on a number of occasions to define the Government^ policy in regard to the Food Council and I replied that this question would be examined in the recess.    Similar questions will no doubt be put to me when Parliament assembles, and I shall be expected to make a definite statement.   A decision is all the more Imperative because of the recent refusal of the London milk distributors to refrain from charging in August last higher prices than were recommended by the Food Council.2.    Our policy for the protection of the consumer In regard not only to food but other necessities of life Is set forth&apos;in &quot;Labour and the Nation&quot; and in our election programme, the relevant passages from which are annexed (Annex II).    We have
undertaken to &quot;protect the consumer a gainst excessive prices by encouraging development of co-operation, by establishing a stringent control over monopolies and combines, by enlarging the powers of the Pood Council&quot;, to secure &quot;maximum possible publicity as to costs and profits&quot; and to &quot;take steps to prevent the profiteering in food&quot; and &quot;watch the operations of trusts and combines, so that combinations which enhance prices unreasonably or refuse to supply or to sell to persons who will not deal exclusively with them may be made subject to law&quot;.    We have now to consider whether action is possible in present circumstances to implement our undertakings, having regard particularly to what has happened about milk prices, and, if so, what form of action is most suitable.3.    There is one definite step which, in my opinion, can and should be taken,  and that is to secure statutory powers to obtain comprehensive information.    Experience has shown that such powers are essential to the satisfactory performance of the present duties of the Food Council, even if we do not find it possible to go further.    Having regard to the wide-spread refusal by traders early in 1928 to supply informa-tion to the Food Council, which led to the last Governments threat to establish the Food Council as a Tribunal of Inquiry (see Parliamentary Question and Answer - Annex III), to the many statements made by members of the last Government that they \vould,  if necessa^,  introduce appropriate legislation (see Annex TV), and to the support which has been given by members of the Liberal party to the principle of publicity in business (see Chapters 7, 8 and 11 of &quot;Britain&apos;s Industrial Future11 ),  it seems to me that it would be very difficult for either of the Opoosition parties officially to oppose a measure giving powers to obtain information in regard to the food trades but providing against the public disclosure of
1 71the details of individual businesses.    The most that could be said, and that only by Conservative members of the Opposition, would be that their threat of a rosolution under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, had proved sufficient and that the Pood Council had made no further Roport asking for compulsory powors to obtain information.     To this the reply would be that the Royal Commission on Food Prices, which was appointed by the last Government, recommended that the Food Council should have such powers in reserve, that the Food Council&apos;s request for powers to obtain Information -was made after every method of obtaining, it voluntarily had been exhausted with the result that necessary enquiries had been delayed in some oases for Rver two years, that even now one section of food traders (provincial milk dealers) has not furnished adequate information, and that in future there ought to be no danger of the work of the Food Council being Impeded or delayed at any time by refusal of information.       Procedure under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 19.21, is clearly not appropriate, particularly as the powers given under it lapse on the conclusion of the enquiry, and ad hoc Resolutions are required for a new enquiry, even when a second enquiry has to be held into the same trade.4,    I would, however, propose to go further.       The present Food Council does not deal with questions of production. It soems to me that we oan give no assurance to the consumer that he is not paying too much for the necessaries of life unless the economic history of a particular commodity can be traced from produotion to ultimate consumption.   I should, therefore, propose thai future onquirieB should be comprehensive and relate to all stages of the prioe structure.5.    Again,  if it is necessary for the Government to intervene-3-
in food questions, intervention Is equally justified in regard to such important articles of domostic use aB clothing and ooal. If this view is approved, it will be necessary to substitute for the present Food Council a body with wider terms of reforenoe -a Consumers1  Council in fact - charged with the duty of safe-guarding the interests of the consumer in regard to food, clothing and ooal.     The Consumers&apos; Council would have to be established by statute and to be invested with statutory powers to obtain the fullest information in regard to production, manufacture, purchase, sale, distribution, transport,  storage,  shipment, supply, cost and price of foodstuffs, ooal, and articles of clothing,and as to profits earned by persons or firms trading in these necessities.       The wording of the Bill will have to be carefully considered, but its general intention should be to secure the fullest information about and germane to the Council&apos;s subjects of enquiry.       Tho grant to the Council of compulsory powers to obtain information in regard to-the business of individual traders would make it necessary to provide that no one direotly interested in the trades in question should be a member of the Council. .   Moreover on grounds of efficiency I should be disposed to limit membership to five at most.      It might possibly be necessary to ask tho Chairman (perhaps also other members) to give the whole of his timo and to pay him.    This would involve extra expense a3 the present Food Council serves on a voluntary basis.      In this connection it may be noted that the Royal Commission on Food Prices contemplated a whole-time paid- Chairman.6.    It remains to consider   whether in addition to investing this new body with powers to obtain information compulsorily the Government should go further.    Our recent experience with the milk traders suggests at once the expedient of price fixing, whether by the Food Council or by a Government Department on their advice.?    but
&quot;TOthis is not attractive.    It was the invariable experience of the Ministry of Pood that a maximum price fixed by the state tends to become the minimum price.   As in fixing prices the price-fixing authority must base its decisions on the costings of a number of businesses, and as the results of different businesses producing the same article vary widely, a dilemma arises:     either the authority must ignore the figures produced by the less remunera-tive businesses, deliberately bankrupt them by fixing a low price, and so imperil distribution, or it must fix a price which is satisfactory to the least remunerative businesses, a price which may very well be higher than that which would have resulted from normal reactions of competition and supply and demand.    It is not possible to assume that the more remunerative businesses would expand to take the place of those which had been eliminated by fixing low price, and it was because of the danger of lessening distributive facilities which results from low prices that the prices fixed by the Ministry of Food in the war were so satisfactory to food traders.     Again it would be difficult to confine Intervention to retail prices; wholesale prices and prices paid to producers would quickly be involved. Price fixing would have to be national, with resultant reactions on the movement of supplies throughout the country; the fixing of prices of allied products  (e.g. butter, cheese, etc. in the case of milk) would be required; it would necessitate regional and central organisations and it would result in constant friction between the authority enforcing it and the trades endeavouring to evade it.     I understand that the experience of the war shewed in fact that in nearly all cases price fixing can only be affective when supplies
1 v&quot; are controlled and owned by the price fixing authority.7.    On the other hand, I need not remind my colleagues that public control and ownership of supplies of household necessities, whether for the purpose of bulk importation, domestic manufacture-ture, distribution, or retail sale, would involve not only major 55 financial operations but legislation that would at once raise in Parliament and in the country the whole issue of public versus private enterprise.     If, as would appear, such legislation is impracticable for the moment, I tjjiinkwe should confine ourselves to giving the Consumers&apos; Council such powers as will secure that when our hands are free, xve shall be able to advance armed with full and complete information.8.    Trusts and Combines.    It will also be necessary for me when Parliament meets to make a statement on the Government^ intentions in regard to trusts and combines.     Here again it will be necessary in due course to introduce legislation giving the the Board of Trade power to obtain the fullest information as to the operations of trusts and combines.      The introduction of legislation on this subject is not so urgent as in the case of the necessaries of life, and how soon It will be possible to present a Bill must, of course, depend on the general Par1iamentary programme.9.    There is, however, one matter on which I suggest action might be taken at once.     I have received a large number of representations complaining of certain practices by associa-tions of traders, mostly directed against co-operative*     The market valuation of the shares of United Dairies Ltd. alone is approximately  6,700,000 and United Dairies Ltd. deals cnly with about 65-70 per cent, of the London wholesale milk trade and about one third of the retail trade.
societies.     The practices take various forms but their effect Is generally to deprive co-operative societies of the ri^ht to obtain cominodities in which they wish to deal.     It Is^very doubtful whether the law relating to &quot;restraint of trade&quot; provides a remedy, and it Is, I think, generally agreed that the present state of the law In the respect has little relation to modern trade practice.     A prlma facie case, therefore, exists for introducing legislation for redefining the law relating to restraint of trade,      I think, however, that as legal as well as commercial considerations are involved, It would -be well to remit to a small Committee the question of the desirability of introducing legislation dealing with this matter.      If my colleagues agree, I should propose to announce the setting up of this Connnittee in any statement which I make in Parliament In regard to trusts and combines.     It would probably be desirable to incorporate any recommendations of the Committee which require legislation in the Dill giving the Board of Trade compulsory powers to obtain information in regard to trusts and combines in general.     Meantime I would point out that if my proposals for the establishment of a Consumers&apos; Council to deal with food, clothing and coal are approved, and the necessary legislation is passed, the new body will be concerned with the operations of the trusts and combines affecting the daily requirements of the people of this country.10.  (1) I suggest for consideration that I should be empower-ed to announce in the House of Commons at an early date that in plaoe of the present Food Council it is proposed, as soon ajB the legislative programme permits, to submit proposals for
the establishment of a Consumers&apos; Council for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of the consumer by obtaining the mo3t comprehensive information in regard to the supply and prices not only of the foodstuffs at present reviewed by the Pood Council but also of coal and clothing.     I should propose to add that the enquiries of the Council would extend to all stages of the price structure including production and the Council would be given power to obtain compulsorily all necessary information.     If as may well be the case we should be criticized for taking no action directly affecting the prices of the necessaries of life, I think the reply should be that our remedy is public control and ownership which wa have no mandate to establish in the present Parliament.(2) As regards trusts and combines, we might announce our intention of introducing into Parliament in due course a Bill enabling the Board of Trade to obtain the fullest inforraa-tion as to the operations of trusts and combines, and that meantime we are setting up a Committee.to review the law regarding &quot;restraint of trade&quot; on the lines which I have indicated above in paragraph 8.W.G.Board of Trade,17th October, 1929.
INSTRUMENT OF APPOINTMENT OP THE FOOD COUNCIL.WHEREAS the Royal Commission on Pood Prices recommended in their First Report that His Majesty&apos;s Government should establish a Food Council;AND WHEREAS it has been represented to me. the Right Honourable Stanley Baldwin, Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury, by the President of the Board of Trade that it is now desirable that a Council ohould be appointed under tho title of the Food Council with the following functions, viz: -To investigate and from time to time report to the President of the Board of Trade on such questions as by reason of oomplaintB from persons interested or otherwise appear to the Council to require investigation in the interests of .consumers or traders, or are referred to them by the President of the Board of Trade, relating to the supply or price of articles of food of general consumption and in particular the following:-Wheat, flour, bread, meat, bacon and ham, milk, butter, cheese, eggs, fish, fruit and vegetables, sugar,  tea.NOW I,  therefore, do hereby appoint the following persons to form the Pood Council and to exercise the function hereinbefore sot forth:-*The Rt. Hon. Lord Bradbury, G.C.B.  (Chairman) sG.A. Powell, Esq., C.B.E.,  (Vice Chairman)P.W. Birchenough, Esq., J.P. fCharles H. Bird, Esq., C.B.E., J.P.Mrs. B.M. Drapper. J.P. **W*E.

Extracte from &quot;Labour and the Nation&quot;.The control of Capitalist Enterprise.    (p.31).It (the Labour Party) will protect the consumer against excessive prtoes, by encouraging the development 1 of co-operation, by establishing a stringent control over monopolies and combines, by enlarging the powers of the Pood Council, and by utilising the experience seoured during the war as to the advantages of the bulk importation of foodstuffs and raw materials by a publio authority.      It will rescue business from the humiliating tradition of secrecy which surrounds it to-day, and will Introduce the maximum possible publicity as to costs and profits.    It will prepare the way for the progressive extonslon of public enterprise into new spheres by Investigations into the conduct of industry and methods of improving it, such as those which have been carried out In the case of coal.The stabilisation of prices,  (p.33).Under existing conditions, in which - to give one example - 60 per cent, of the meat consumed in^Great Britain is Imported,  the price of home-grown supplies is largely governed by the price of foreign meat, and this in turn is affected by influences which are necessarily outside the control of tho producers in this country.     The result too often is that farming is turned into a gamble in which the dice aro loaded against the British producer, that enterprise is discouraged because it is at the mercy of unpredictable risks, and that the producer is distracted from his proper task of organising production by the necessity of attempting to follow the course of constantly changing markets. &quot;Fluctuations in prices,&quot; the Prime Minister of Australia has observed, &quot;benefit only the speculative middlemen&quot;.   -The Labour Party&apos;s policy is designed to bring them under control in the interests alike of producers and consumers. It would transform the import of meat into a public service, and would vest tho responsibility for it in the hands of an Import Board composed of expert directors appointed by the juinistry of Agriculture or the Board of Trade, and charged with the duty of organising in the most efficient and economical manner the business of purchasing, distributing and trans-porting the whole Import of meat.     Since it would operate upon a large scale, the Board would eliminate many of the unnecessary charges with which both producers and consumers are burdened to-day.     As it would have all imported supplies under its control, it would be in a position to smooth out the fluctuations in prices which disorganise the business of agriculture, would seoure the farmer a stable market in which to sell his produoe, and bring corresponding advantages to the general body of consumers.GlOBe Relations with the Dominions,  (p.50).In the scheme for the bulk purchase of food supplies and raw materials, which forms part of Labour&apos;e agricultural
policy, the Dominions and other parts of the British Commonwealth would play an important part.     A Labour Government would provide facilities for overseas producers in the marketing of their produce In this country with a view to stabilising prices and eliminating unnecessary intermediaries, whilst it would co-operate in the control ^and cheapening of the transport of food supplies to Great Britain.Summary (p. 54-5).The Labour Party asks for power.     If granted power, it will use it both to lay the foundations of a new social order, and to relieve immediate distress, by carrying out, as rapidly as Parliamentary opportunity permits, the policy embodied in &quot;Labour and the Nation,&quot; of which the following legislative and administrative measures are a summary:The protection of the consumer against exploitation and the extension of the powers of the Food Council.The establishment of the fullest possible publicity with regard to costs- and profits.The stabilisation of prioes by the collective purchase of imported grain and meat.Extract from the official election programme.It (a Labour Government) would take steps to prevent the profiteering in food and in building materials, and would watch the operations of trusts&apos; and combines, so that combinations which enhance prices unreasonably or refuse to supply or to sell to persons who will not deal exclusively with them may be made subject to law.
FOOD COUNCIL.Question put by Mr. Ramsay Macdonald M.P., answered by the prime Minister in the House of Commons onThursday, May 17th 1939.Mr. Ramsay Macdonald asked the Prime Minister Thether the Food council have experienced any difficulties in obtaining from food traders the information necessary for the Council&apos;s work, and if so, &apos;.that action the Government proposes to take.The Prime Minister&apos;s reply was that the President of the Board of Trade has to-day received a report from the Food council regarding the difficulties which they have experienced in obtaining information from certain food traders.    Copies of this report are being placed in the Library, and it is being communicated to the press.The Government are prepared to give the Food Council all the support required to enable them to obtain essential information and they are so informing the Council.    Unless therefore within a reasonable period the requisite information is supplied to the Food Council by those traders who have so far failed to do so, the Government propose to ask Parliament to grant the necessary pov/ers to the Council by means of a Resolution under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.

They have not been working long enough yet to get all the information we desire and which the public require but I do repeat that if at any time with full knowledge we are convinced that any form of action is necessary, we shall take the form that we think necessary, whatever legislation it may involve&quot;.Mr. Baldwin, Welbook Abbey, 29th May, .1928.&quot;Two weeks ago I informed the House of Commons that unless the food traders concerned would furnish the Oounoil with the information they desired we shall have to go to Parliament to give tho Council the powers they want.   Public information must go along with private onterprise.    In this era of large amalgamations of producers and distributing companies, the position is very different from what it was.   With multiple shops and great importing and selling concerns acting on a uniform polioy through innumerable channels the safeguarding of the individual consumer face to face with such bodies becomes a matter of most urgent practical importance&quot;.Mr. Baldwin, on Petrol Prioes, House of Commons, 7th March, 1929,&quot;Special considerations arise where a single undertaking or an associated group of undertakings dominates the supply and the general distribution of an article of commouse.....They have a duty to supply on reasonabletorms and the public have a right to be satisfied that/ A Milk Distribution (Ascertainment of Costs and Profits) Bill was drafted and printed and submitted to the Home Affairs Committee of the Cabinet but did not reach first reading.King&apos;s Speeoh to Parliament, 15th January, 1924:-

The Government consider...... that the companies should be prepared toexplain the reasons for any considerable increase in price&quot;.Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister on Petrol Prices, House of Commons, 21at March, 1929.&quot;The pi^ime Minister has already stated that the Government consider that undertakings dominating the supply and distribution of articles of common use have a duty to supply on reasonable terms and to satisfy the public that their terms are reasonable and these considerations will, of course, be equally applicable to future as well as to present circumstances&quot;.Mr. Herbert Williams, House of Commons, 12th June, 1929.&quot;On 17th May the Prime Minister made the very definite statement,   that &quot;unless within a reasonable period the requisite information is supplied to thePood council, etc.&apos;   ....... If there is any default of course the pledge of the Prime Minister will be carried outu.Lord Bradbury (reported in &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; 29th July, 1925).&quot;.  .  .  . He believed that information would be supplied voluntarily to the Council, and if there was any difficulty or if information was found to be inaccurate it would then become necessary that such powers should be sought, and the Prime Minister had given a pledge that the Government&quot;would be asked to confer them upon the Council&quot;.Lord Bradbury, Broadcast speech, 15th October, 1925:&quot;  .  .  .  . Facilities for investigation will be given by the trade associations of their own accord or we must appeal to the Government for compulsory powers to inspect books - powers which the Government have promised us and /rhicli will not be denied&quot; .
