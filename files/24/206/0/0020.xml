Copy of Letter from the Chancellor of the exchequer to the Minister of Health..Treasury Chambers, S.W.1. October 8th,  1929.Dear Greenwood,when the Cabinet discussed yesterday the question of the contributior of serving soldiers &amp;C under the Contributory Peas Ions Act I had not unfort-unately been full:/ briefed on the subject and I there-fore did not realise that the problem was one of considerable difficulty.      Indeed I understand that if we adhere tc the decision shown in the Cabinet minutes there is great danger of our being led ultimately into further expenditure amounting to  4 millions a year on pensions to War Widows.     This is a risk ^hich I am not prepared to face without further consideration more especially as I understand that you yourself feel great doubts about the wisdom of 77-esterday&apos; s decision,,      ^f course It is unfortunate thi all the Service &quot;&quot;&quot;Unisters are- out of the country and will not be back until after the circulation of your Bill,      In these circumstances I think&apos;that, If you agree, I must take the responsibility of cutting the clause, or clauses on this particular subject out of the Bill altogether and of deciding that the matter shall be left over for the larger enquiry which is now being undertaken.      It would of course be necessary to inform the Cabinet at their, next meeting.Yours sincerely,(Signed) &quot; PHILIP SNOWDEN. The Rt.Hon. Arthur Greenwood, i.i,P.
Copy of letter from the Minister of Health to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Ministry of Health,,9th October, 1929.Dear Snowden,Thank you for your letter of the 8th October, about the question of the contribution of serving soldiers, etc. under the Contributory Pensions Act. I agree vilth you &quot;that the clause on this subject should be removed from the Pensions Bill and that the whole question should be left for the larger inquiry. I agree also that the Cabinet shoul^ be informed as soon as possible and I assume that you will arrange for this?Yours sincerely,(Signed)    ARTHUR GREENWOOD.The Rt..Hon. Philip Snovrden, M.B., Treasury . Chambers,  S.V:. 1.
