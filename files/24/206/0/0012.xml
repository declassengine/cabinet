JlS DOCUMENT  15 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC i-majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENT).[EGRET.IP. 2S2  (29)?COPY NO:CABINET.UNEMPLOYMENT  INSURANCE BILL COMMITTEE.SECOND REPORT .J \The Unemployment Insurance Bill Committee has had under consideration the decision of the Cabinet at the meeting of 25th - September on the proposal contained in the Report of the Committee dated 20th September,. 1929,  C ..P ..2.53 (29).It was evident from the proceedings at the Cabinet that they were not pi prepared to sanction an intermediate scheme.      They desire that a more general scheme should be examined which would deal also with the whole problem of the able-bodied unemployed not covered by the&quot; Unemployment Insurance Scheme.      But it is clear that, such a scheme could not be settled and put intc operation in time to deal with the immediate problem.In these circumstances the only alternative is to maintain the status quo for the unemployed persons affected, that isj to extend the transitional period for a time so that the persons concerned may continue to be paid without the &quot;30-contribution&quot; qualification,  subject, however,  to payment by the Exchequer of the extra cost thus entailed.For reasons vhich were explained in the previous Report,  such an extension of the transitional period can onlj be made if the Exchequer pays the cost.As regerds the length of the transitional period, the choice appears  to be between an extension of one or of two years.      An extension of two years would reduce the
risk of having to deal with the problem a second time, but would probably be criticised on the ground that the problem was being postponed indefinitely.      On the whole, therefore,  an extension of one year is proposed..The conditions for the receipt of the transitional payments would be t- e transitional conditions now in operation,  subject, of course,  to any changes  (e.g. as regards the provision of training) which may be made on general grounds in the Unemployment Insurance Bill shortly to be introduced.      It Is estimated that the cost in a full year would be between  5,000,000 and  6,000,000.      For the first year it woviid be about half this amount 0The Committee accordingly propose -(a) that  the transitional period be lengthened by one year, a,nd(b) that the Exchequer make an additional contribution to the Fund equal to the cost thereby incurred.In making these proposals the Committee assume thatthe Cabinet will also wiah to have an immediateexamination made into the more general problem of thetransfer of the able-bodied unemployed from the Poor Lawand will give directions accordingly.,Signed on behalf of the Committee,IvIARGARET G.  BONDFIELD, Chairman,,Whitehall Gardens, S.!,V.lu30th September, 1929.
