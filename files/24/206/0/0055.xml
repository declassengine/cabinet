THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTC5---:--1Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1929.SECRET.CP. 308 (29).CABINET.CLOSER UNION IN  EAST AFRICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.NO subject has given me so much cause for consideration as the changes to be made in East Africa. I think that Kenya has been in my thoughts every single day since we took office ! Noav that a decision has to be taken, I feel that, whatever we do, we shall be faced with a minor hurricane of criticism and denunciation; and if we decide to do nothing, we shall have no less a storm, together with the real discredit of shirking the issues. It is clear that we must ignore both the campaign of letter-writing and newspaper articles, and the denunciations that will follow the decision, and take the course which, in the light of the actual facts of the situation, seems to promise the best results.This practical decision will be all the easier, in that the controversy rages mainly over matters of secondary importance. We can clear the way by an authoritative pronouncement on Native Policy (to be published as a White Paper, in continuation of those of 1923 and 1927), which will I hope allay the apprehensions of those interested in the welfare of the natives. And we can largely silence the opposition of others who might be vocal, by declaring the intention of the Govern-ment to submit its proposals to a Joint Committee of both Houses, whose decision would give considerable lasting authority to any constitutional changes that might be effected.Assuming that this course commends itself to my colleagues, the outstanding issues to be decided are the following : (1.) Whether there should be a new officer appointed, whose duties would be to supervise Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda (a Governor-General or a High Commissioner), and what should be his functions and powers in relation to the three Governments, which, among them, exercise juris-diction over an area not far short of that of British India.(2.) Assuming such an officer to be appointed, what alteration, if any, should be made in the composition of the Kenya Legislative Council.Most people seem to agree that such an officer should be appointed, but they differ violently about the functions and powers to be entrusted to him. The Hilton Young Commission recommended (though in somewhat vague language, not every-where consistent with itself) that he should be expressly placed in control of &quot; Native Policy,&quot; in which he would not only dictate administration to all three Governors, but also, as I see it, relieve the Secretary of State very largely of his duties of &quot; trusteeship&quot; ! I have come definitely to the conclusion that this is both impracticable and undesirable. &quot; Native Policy &quot; admittedly includes not only the disposal and administration of land, but also the taxation of the natives (now alleged to be both excessive, and wrongly motived by the desire to compel the men to take service at wages in order to pay their taxes), and thus the framing of the annual Budget for each territory; not merely all the law and administration relating to wage-labour, but also sanitation and medical services, along with education and technical training (all of which are said to be unfairly divided in Kenya among the 13,000 whites, the 26,000 Indians and the couple of million Africans); not merely customs tariffs and railway rates (alleged to penalise the natives), but also the copy No.     30
provision of further railways, roads and bridges (which are said to have been hitherto provided in Kenya mainly for the benefit of the estates of the white settlers). To take all these matters out of the hands of the Governors and Legislative Councils of the three areas would be to leave them next to nothing to govern. Even the administration of criminal justice and of the police force, in a country where the breach of a contract of service by the wage-earner is a criminal offence, is very closely bound up with &quot; Native Policy.&quot;Apart from the impracticability of transferring &quot; Native Policy,&quot; as such, to a Governor-General or High Commissioner, there is also the undesirability of practically devolving upon him the &quot;trusteeship&quot; with which His Majesty&apos;s Government is charged, and which is emphasized by the Covenant of the Versailles Treaty as regards all native races, and more specifically insisted on in the Mandate for Tanganyika. It is of the essence of trusteeship that it cannot be devolved or delegated the moral (and often the legal) responsibility remains with the Trustee himself, notwithstanding all devolution or delegation. Considering to what local influences our Colonial Governors are exposed, to which they sometimes succumb, I see no alternative if we mean what we say about trusteeship to maintaining unimpaired the responsibility and the authority of the Secretary of State.Moreover, it is, in my Opinion, essential to comply very exactly and completely with the Mandate for Tanganyika. The Germans watch very closely every step. The Permanent Mandates Commission lends them an ear. In my opinion, a Governor-General for East Africa, or even a High Commissioner having control of &quot; Native Policy &quot; as such thus taking this away from Tanganyika itself would be objected to as contrary to the Mandate.It is perhaps a minor objection that any such wholesale transfer is strongly objected to by practically every section of all three territories not merely by the three Governors, their Legislative Councils and the representatives of the Kenya settlers, but also by the powerful native communities in Uganda and other parts of the area. It is here that Sir Samuel Wilson&apos;s narrowly restricted mission a mission which he discharged with ability, tact and discretion has been most helpful in discovering what it would be practically impossible to put in operation.How much Close?&apos; Union is Practical or Desirable fFortunately, we need not necessarily be limited to the extreme way in which the main recommendations of the Hilton Young Commission are now being pressed by a deliberately organised campaign of letter-writing press articles and personal persuasion.   I regard the case as made out for (1) the &quot;closer union&quot; of what are called the &quot;economic services &quot; (railways &quot; and harbours, posts and telegraphs, customs, &amp;c), together with defence(the disposition of the local forces), and &quot; central research &apos;&apos; (the Amani Institute and any analogous development). (2) This is, however, only one part of the question at issue. There is needed some form of centralised supervision (but not direct executive control), exercised on behalf of the Secretary of State, of everything bearing on the welfare and progress of the natives in all three territories, not with any idea of bringing about uniformity in their respective systems (a uniformity, in my judgment, positively undesirable), but for the threefold purpose of ensuring common action, where this is requisite; of concerting with the three Governors any practicable improvements; and, above all, of keeping the Secretary of State informed of all new developments in time to enable any necessary action to betaken. I am convinced that some such arrangement is indispensable if the &quot;trusteeship&quot; for the natives is to be made effective. There will be constant need for special watchfulness as to (a) any  departure from the declaration on Native Policy by HisMajesty&apos;s Government;(b) the continued compliance with the obligations as to native races underthe Covenant of the Versailles Treaty and the League of Nations;(c) as regards Tanganyika, also, the continued observance, in the spiritas well as in the letter, of the conditions of the Mandate which we must take the opportunity of saying that we have no intention of abandoning, or of seeking to modify in any way.
o&apos;6What is called for is, in my judgment, a High Commissioner for East Africa, not a Governor-General (the choice of title is most important), with effective control over the &quot; economic services &quot;&apos; of all three territories, which (as I am advised) can only be exercised through a joint council having legislative powers. (Special provisions would be required and have been devised (i) to maintain unimpaired the position of Tanganyika as a distinct unit of administration, although combined for certain purposes contemplated by Article 10 of the Mandate; and (ii) to forestall any allegation that Tanganyika is being subjected to control by Kenya and Uganda, or that the power and direct responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government under the Mandate is being^abrogated or &quot;even impeded.)But the sphere of the proposed High Commissioner would not be confined to the &quot; economic services,&quot; though it is for these alone that he must have a Legislative Council. In addition, he would be permanent Chairman of the very useful &apos;&apos; Conference of Governors &apos;&apos; (primarily of Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika, but in which other territories would, as now, be included when necessary), which should be summoned regularly for consultation on all important matters, and thus on every aspect of Native Policy in this sphere the High Commissioner would exercise all the influence on events that is compatible with the continued existence of separate Governments. In particular, he would automatically receive copies of all Bills put before the local legislatures, and be informed of all new departures in administra-tion; and, what is even more important, on these he would be in a position directly to advise the Secretary of State. To ensure that the widest possible range should be given to the High Commissioner^ position, I propose that, in addition to special instructions from the Secretary of State from time to time, he should be furnished with copies of all important despatches that pass between the Secretary of State and the Governors of the territories concerned, which would enable him to keep himself generally in touch with all questions of policy under discussion in those territories.I wish to make it clear that the assignation of any such functions to the High Commissioner would not imply any devolution whatsoever of the responsibility of the Secretary of State. The High Commissioner would in all things have to carry out the instructions of the Secretary of State, and he would not be, and could not become, a quasi-independent functionary, as seems to be suggested in the Hilton Young Report.Finally, for Kenya, where the supervision of the High Commissioner is perhaps most required, I propose that he (and not the Governor of Kenya) should deal with native lands. It has, in fact, already been arranged, with the acquiescence of the Governor and the Executive Council of Kenya, that the Native Lands Trust Board (which is, Jn these very weeks, being established by local law) should be presided over by the High Commissioner for East Africa, if and when such an officer is appointed. In this way the High Commissioner would virtually control all future disposition of the Kenya Native Reserves, the protection of which against being, on various plausible grounds, &apos;&apos; nibbled away &apos;&apos; is all-important.The High -Commissioner, and the staff that he will require, are estimated to cost  50,000 per annum. This amount is within the amount of saving to be expected (though such saving is not the most important advantage to be gained) from the amalgamation of the economic services and the union of the defence forces. The total revenue of the three territories exceeds  6,000,000 per annum.The Kenya Legislative Council.The question then arises of the change to be made in the Kenya Legislative Council. This consists, at present, of (a) 11 members of European descent elected for a term of three years in as many constituencies by persons of European descent; (b) 5 Indian members elected by Indian electors on a separate register for separate constituencies; (c) 1 Arab member elected by Arabs; (d) 20 officials, 11 ex officio and 9 nominated by the Governor, of whom one is an Arab; (e) 1 nominated unofficial member (a missionary) to represent native interests. There is no power to add other members, who might be valuable additions to the Council.In my judgment, this Council has not, in practice, proved satisfactory in carrying out the explicit requirements of His Majesty&apos;s Government in 1923 for &quot; the protection and advancement of the native races.&quot; Notwithstanding what is called an &quot; official majority,&quot; the interests of the Africans have not been main-tained, whilst their welfare and their advancement in civilisation have not been sufficiently promoted.   The revenue of the Colony has been raised out of all propor-
tion to &apos;&apos; ability to pay &apos;&apos;; the direct taxation on the natives is in excess of the expenditure on services specially provided for them; and the special requirements of the 13,000 inhabitants of European descent have been regarded disproportionately to those of the 26,000 Indians or the 2,500,000 natives. The &apos;&apos; official majority &apos;&apos; has proved, under one Governor after another, as a defence of the natives, a broken reed. As we have found in other Colonies, its very existence has been an irritant, without being effective clS el safeguard.It is not practicable to withdraw from the European settlers their right to elect their own representatives. Indeed, there are practical reasons for increasing their numbers from 11 to 13 (which I should propose to do). It is no less impracticable, now or in any near future, to enfranchise the two million natives, even if we could find any Governor to admit that there is, at present, a single East African adequately educated and at the same time of sufficient standing and influence to keep his end up in the Council.After much consideration, and investigation of all the alternatives, I have come to the conclusion that we should substitute a nominated for an official majority. I would give the Governor practical power to outvote the 11 (or 13) elected European members whenever he deems it important so to do, without the invidious (and. of ten extremely inconvenient) presence in the Council of a quite disproportionate number of officials. For this purpose there should be, in the Council, only 5 official members ex officio, whilst the Governor should be required to nominate without any racial or other restriction on his choice, and in each case only for a short term (with eligibility for renomination), up to 15 other members, of whom, in the first instance at any rate, not more than 8 should be such additional officials as he may select (thus providing against some being absent on leave or otherwise); whilst he would be definitely instructed to nominate the non-officials so as to represent, as far as practicable, interests not represented by the elected members (i.e., so as not to increase the European settlers group).Only by some such arrangement can I see any chance of getting into the Kenya Council, within view, with any effectiveness at all, either the missionary or other philanthropic defenders of the interests of the natives, a few of whom can be found even in Kenj^a; or, if and when such can be discovered, Africans of sufficient education and public standing to be effective as direct representatives of their race. In addition to what I think would be a more effective control of the Council than heretofore, the Governor would have powers of reservation, veto and certification. I propose to add to the classes of Bills that he is required to submit for the consideration of the Secretary of State, any measure which has evoked strenuous opposition from any racial or religious minority, and which, in his opinion, might cause hardship or oppression. (This provision, which has been inserted in the new Constitution for Ceylon, would enable the Secretary of State to act as arbitrator in acute differences of opinion rather than allow any majority to ride roughshod over any minority.)It is largely in&apos; order to make more effective the protection of the interest of the Kenya natives that I am proposing (&quot;as already mentioned) that the High Commissioner should (i) be permanent Chairman of the Governors&apos; Conference and President of the Kenya Native Lands Trust Board; (ii) receive automatically all Bills laid before the Legislature and all important despatches; and (iii) himself communicate fully with the Secretary of State so as to enable the latter to intervene with telegraphic instructions to the Governor whenever required. In this way (and as far as I can see, only in this way) the Governor&apos;s powers of reservation, veto and certification, in addition to his control of the Council, could be made really effective for the maintenance of the Native Policy laid down by His Majesty&apos;s Government, so long as a Secretary of State, supplied with timely notice of any projected deviation, will insist on its maintenance.  More than this we cannot do !It will be objected that this &quot; abandonment of the official majority &quot; will involve the &quot; triumph of the white settlers &quot; and be an &quot; irrevocable step towards responsible government,&quot; and consequently the &quot;handing over of 2,500,000 unenfranchised Africans to the rule of 13,000 white employers of black labour.&quot; All this rests on a misunderstanding. Something of the sort might (with great exaggeration) be said if it was proposed to supersede the official majority by an elected majority. But this is not proposed. On the contrary, it is proposed merely to substitute a nominated majority (including 13 or more officials) for a majority made up exclusively of officials. No inference can be drawn from Colonial history indicating that the institution of a nominated (as distinguished from an elective) majority amounts
to an irrevocable step towards Responsible Government! Anyway, the present proposal is not at all irrevocable. I propose that the Governor should have power to choose, in case of need, all his nominees from the ranks of his own officials; and it would be made clear in the despatch that he would be instructed to take this course if the necessity arose. In fact, I believe, the. very effective influence to be given to the High Commissioner will enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to ensure much greater protection to the natives against an abusive use of the white man&apos;s power than has hitherto been practicable, even with an official majority.The Position of the Indian Population.There remains the intractable problem of the status of the Indians in Kenya, as to which the Government of India and the India Office have always been concerned,I have carefully considered the representations, written and oral, made on their behalf. The Indians have, like the European settlers, been accorded direct repre-sentation in the Council; and this in such a way that their election cannot be prevented by the European settlers (as it would probably otherwise be in all but one Or two of the single-member constituencies into which the Colony is divided). This, however, involves two separate registers, one for European and the other for Indian electors (&quot; the communal roll&quot;). This separate register, whatever its motive or effect, has come to be regarded as a badge of inferiority; and the Indians in Kenya, in sympathy with Indian Nationalism (and mainly at its instigation) vehemently demand to be included, with the Europeans, in one common register  even at the possible cost of failing to get any Indian elected, or that of having their franchise qualification raised so as to exclude, by what is called a &quot;civilisation test,&quot; one half or more of the present Indian electors. To enforce this demand they have withdrawn their five members from the Kenya Council, leaving these seats vacant. Their demand is, however, equally vehement^ resisted by the European settlers; and I am satisfied that any immediate merging of the two communal registers is politically quite impracticable. All that I can propose is (i) not to negative for all time the idea of a common register for all races on a franchise dependent on a &quot;civilisation test,&quot; but indefinitely to defer its fulfilment (as we do the demand of the European settlers for &quot;responsible government&quot; or the enfranchisement of even educated Africans) until some future time; (ii) in the meantime to do some-thing even as a mere gesture to indicate that His Majesty&apos;s Government is keeping it in view (this was strongly urged by Sir Muhammad Habibullah whom the Government of India deputed to see me on the subject). The gesture I propose is to ask for a general enquiry into the numbers, by age and sex, vocations, duration of residence in Kenya, educational attainments, economic position, institutions, character of dwelling houses, &amp;o, of the whole Indian population of Kenya Colony  not a census, but a sort of social survey, for the information of His Majesty&apos;s Government, which has at present little exact knowledge on the subject. This commits us to nothing; would be, in itself, very- useful in revealing what needs to be clone for them, and would, I am assured, soften the blow of the present necessary refusal to merge the two communal rolls.Meanwhile, I propose (if the European elected members are increased fromII to 13) to raise correspondingly the number of the Indians from 5 to 6; to make the Indians eligible along Avith Europeans as nominated members; to enable the Governor to fill by nomination the places in the Council reserved for Indians, in the event of these continuing to be left vacant; to provide practically for the inclusion of one of them among the four unofficial representatives of the Kenya Council op the proposed High Commissioners Council; and to take care that no new racial distinctions are made against them.Summary.There are various other matters of detail involved in the proposed changes, but in view of the necessary length of this Memorandum I do not trouble my -colleagues to go into them.   To sum up. I propose :  (1.) That the Government should make a comprehensive declaration of Native Policy to be published as a White Paper in continuation of those of 1923 and 1927. (A tentative draft, subject to further revision, is submitted herewith, in the form of a despatch. I ask whether any other form would be preferable.)
(2.) That new Instruments be prepared providing for a High Commissioner for East Africa, with a Legislative Council for certain economic services, - and for a new Legislative Council for Kenya, on the lines indicated in this Memorandum.(3.) That the heads of these Instruments, with full explanations in detail, together with the declaration on Native Policy, be laid before Parlia-ment, with a resolution appointing a Joint Committee of both Houses to consider and report upon the proposed constitutional changes.P-Colonial Office, November 5. 1929.
APPENDIX A,Draft Despatch to the Governor of Kenya. (Copies to be made also for the Governors of Uganda and Tanganyika.)Sir,IN my despatch of I had the honour to inform youof the decisions taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government for submission to Parliament with regard to constitutional changes in East Africa, on which Sir Samuel Wilson has made a valuable report in supplement of that of the Commission on Closer Union of 1927. Sir Samuel Wilson&apos;s Report was confined mainly to questions of the administrative machinery required to give effect to a scheme of closer union; he did not attempt, in the limited time at his disposal in East Africa, to do more than ascertain that little orx no exception was taken . to the views expressed in the Hilton Young Report on native policy. I have thought it well to reserve this important matter for a separate despatch, and I now propose to set out a statement of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the principles to be aimed at by the East African Governments in carrying out the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the native inhabitants, and to discuss the methods of applying this policy in relation to the various aspects of the problem. The question of native policy in East Africa, and particularly in Kenya, is one which assumes special importance in connection with the decisions taken upon Closer Union, and one upon which His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to leave no possible doubt as to their attitude.2. I think it well at the outset to recall and quote the declaration of policy incorporated in the Kenya White Paper of July 1923 (Cmd. 1922) : &quot; Primarily Kenya is an African territory, and His Majesty&apos;s Government think it necessary definitely to record their considered opinion that the interests of the xAfrican natives must be paramount, and that, if and when those interests and the interests of the immigrant races should conflict, the former should prevail. Obviously, the interests of the other communities, European, Indian or Arab, must severally be safeguarded. Whatever the circumstances in which members of these communities have entered Kenya, there will be no drastic action or reversal of measures already introduced, such as may have been contemplated in some quarters, the result of which might be to destroy or impair the existing interests of those who have already settled in Kenya. But in the administration of Kenya His Majesty&apos;s Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African population, and they are unable to delegate or share this trust, the object of which may be defined as the protection and advancement of the native races. It is not necessary to attempt to elaborate this position; the lines of development are as yet in certain directions undetermined, and many difficult problems arise which require time for their solution. But there can be no room for doubt that it is the mission of Great Britain to work continuously for the training and education of the Africans towards a higher intellectual, moral and economic level than that which they had reached when the Crown assumed the responsibility for the administration of this territory.&quot;In the case of Tanganyika, His Majesty, by accepting a Mandate which His Majesty&apos;s Government have no intention of abandoning or of seeking to modify in any way in respect of the territory as one inhabited by peoples not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world, has reaffirmed the principle, long an axiom of British policy and now embodied in the Covenant of the League, that the well-being and development of such peoples form a sacred trust of civilisation; and has undertaken, by article 3 of the Mandate, to promote to the utmost the material and moral well-being and the social progress of its inhabitants. The Mandate contains a number of specific provisions directed to that end.3. With the statement in the White Paper of 1923 in all its aspects and Avith all its implications, as well as with the principle laid doAvn in the Covenant of the League, and in the Mandate for Tanganyika Territory, His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to express their complete concurrence.   They fully accept the principle that
the relation of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the native populations in East Africa is one of trusteeship which cannot be devolved, and from which they cannot be relieved. The ultimate responsibility for the exercise of this trusteeship must accordingly rest with them alone.It will be noted that this principle of trusteeship for the native population is in no way inconsistent with what has been described as the &quot;Dual Policy,&quot; if this-is properly understood.   The task and the duty of government in East Africa is, in fact, two-fold, though the division is not between administration for the immigrant races and for the native population respectively.   On the one hand, it must be the aim of the administration of every territory with regard to all the inhabitants, irrespective of race or religion, to maintain order, to administer justice, to promote health and education, to provide means of communication and transport, and generally to promote the industrial and commercial development of the country.   In all this range of work persons of every race and of every religion, coloured no less than white, have a right to equal treatment in accordance with their several needs, and 1 in Kenya the immigrant races call for nothing more.    But in the East African communities, the duty of trusteeship for peoples &quot; not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world &quot; involves; in respect of these peoples, not an alternative system of administration, contrasted with that adopted with regard to immigrant races who are able to stand by themselves, but merely an addition to, or rather a specialised application and extension of the common administration of which the benefits are enjoyed by the whole population.   It is with the additional benefits and the exceptional safeguards called for by tne special needs of the peoples &quot; not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world &quot; that the trusteeship for the native races is particularly concerned; and it is essentially to ensure the maintenance of these exceptional safeguards and the development of these additional benefits that His Majesty&apos;s Government must necessarily, as trustee, retain in their own hands, the ultimate decision and the final control.   Even where, as in Kenya, His Majesty&apos;s Government propose that the majority of official members in the Legislative Council should be replaced by a majority partly of officials and partly of the Governors nominees, there can be no question of departing from the fundamental principle enunciated above.  It is necessary that its observance should be secured by providing, as you have been informed, that the Governor of Kenya should possess not only powers of reservation, veto and certification, but also the duty of submitting for His Majesty&apos;s pleasure any enactment which has evoked the strenuous opposition of any racial or other group, and which, in the Governors opinion, might lead to hardship or oppression.   These provisions are designed to ensure that in the last resort the local decision on any question in which the interests or well-being of the native population are involved will rest primarily with the Governor and ultimately with the Secretary of State.   His Majesty&apos;s Government wish, however, to make it clear that it is in no sense their intention to exclude native affairs from the purview of the Legislative Council, and that their decision in regard to the Governors power of reservation, veto and certification is not inspired by any feeling of distrust as to the Legislative Council&apos;s goodwill towards the natives and desire to promote their interests.   On the contrary, His Majesty&apos;s Government fully and readily appreciate the interest which unofficial members of the Legislative Council have repeatedly shown in native affairs, notably during recent years, and they regard it as essential that the feeling of responsibility of all the unofficial members of the Council towards the native population of the Colony should be recognised and encouraged.    His Majesty&apos;s Government accordingly wish to make it clear that they regard the unofficial members of the Council, whether elected  or nominated, as equally responsible with the Government members in respect of the advice they may tender the Governor upon native affairs.   It is partly for this reason that His Majesty&apos;s Government propose that the powers of reservation, certification and veto should be vested in the Governor of Kenya rather than in the High Commissioner for East Africa, since, unlike the High Commissioner, the Governor will be in close touch with, and will have the advice of, an exclusively local Legislative Council.   To sum up, both the Governor and the Council are regarded by His Majesty&apos;s Government as sharing in the responsibility for native welfare in the Colony, unless and until the Governor finds it necessary to differ from his Council and, as the representative of His Majesty, to exercise those over-riding powers, without which His Majesty&apos;s Government could not ensure the maintenance of the trusteeship for which they themselves must continue essentially and irrevocably responsible.
4. Apart from the principle of trusteeship which has been discussed in the preceding paragraph, His Majesty&apos;s Government accept no less whole-heartedly the Duke of Devonshire&apos;s declaration in the White Paper of 1923 that the interests of the African Natives must be paramount, and that, if and when those interests and the interests of the immigrant races should conflict, the former should prevail. This aspect of the question is discussed at length in the Report of the Commission on Closer Union, where the view is expressed that the &quot; paramountcy &quot; of native interests is to be interpreted in the sense that the creation and preservation of a field for &quot;the full development of native life is a first charge oh any territory, and that the Government having created this field in the establishment of an organised governmental administration of the modern tj^pe has the duty to devote its energies to assisting the natives to make the best possible use of the opportunities open to them. This obligation, which is plainly involved in the trusteeship, must be regarded as in no way incompatible with the common duty of any Government to promote the development of the resources of its territory and the prosperity of its inhabitants, including the immigrant communities within it. His Majesty&apos;s Government adopt this interpretation as a general statement of a matter in which a more precise definition is difficult of achievement. In practice, there is no reason to anticipate difficulty in applying the principle in any particular case where conflict between native and other interests arises. It is, of course, obvious that such conflict may arise not only between native and European interests but also between native interests and non-native interests other than European. In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, their trusteeship necessarily involves the corollary that all proposals designed to promote the well-being or the interests of any non-native race must be carefully examined, at the outset, from the standpoint of their effect on the native races, and in any case of doubt as to this effect, reference should be made to the Secretary of State for a decision.5. I now pass from these fundamental considerations of trusteeship and the paramountcy of natives&apos; interests to the opinions expressed in the Report of the Commission on Closer Union with regard to native policy and administration. These opinions do not constitute any novel doctrine. They have long been implicit in the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to the native races in the different parts of the Empire. They may, indeed, be regarded as little more than an amplification of the policy laid down in the White Paper of 1923, and, broadly speaking, they are wholly acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Commis-sion appear, however, to have envisaged a single system of native administration which would be generally applied throughout the East African Dependencies. His Majesty&apos;s Government, on the other hand, take the view that, while it is possible to lay down certain general principles of universal application in East Africa, it is neither practicable nor desirable to draw up any common code, or even to frame any uniform system of native administration, in view of the fact that the local conditions and the state of native development vary from territory to territory, and even from district to district within the same territory. Native policy, moreover, cannot be divorced from the general problems of administration with which the Government of any dependency, whether Colony, Protectorate or Mandated Territory, is called upon to deal. It includes such wide fields as taxation, the disposal of land, the pro-vision of the means of communication and transport, the levying of appropriate customs duties on imports, the conditions of the employment of wage-labour, the promotion of health and education among all races, and the prevention of disease among animals and plants, and it must, therefore, embrace almost every branch of the Governments activities. This is another reason, besides that already mentioned above, -why His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided that the question of native administration in each Territory should remain one for the Governor and the local Council, and why it should not be handed over to the proposed High Commis-sioner for East Africa, as the Commissioners on Closer Union appear to suggest. This decision will not, of course, preclude the High Commissioner from keeping himself informed on matters relating to native policy, especially, though not exclusively, in cases in which common action in more than one territory seems desirable, and from drawing attention to any matters which he considers it desirable to bring to the notice of the several Governors and the Secretary of State. In particular, his position as chairman of the Governors&apos; Conference will enable him to discuss these matters fully with the Governors and to concert action with them or, in cases of doubt, to agree with them on a reference to the Secretary of State for his instructions.
6. I will now set out in greater detail the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the application of the general principles of policy which have been laid down in the previous paragraphs of this despatch. The subject can, perhaps, be most conveniently dealt with under three heads : (a) political, (b) social, and (c) economic.7. (a.) Remote though it may appear in present circumstances, in view of theexisting stateof political development of the natives of East Africa, His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot doubt that the ultimate objective to be aimed at is such an advance in knowledge and civilisation among them as &quot;would enable them to JL&amp;ke part in the government of a dependency as full citizens, on the basis of a civilisation test. This objective, however, like that of the complete abandonment of any racial distinctions, that of universal suffrage, or that of the institution of responsible government in populations composed of such diverse elements, is plainly one which cannot be reached for a long time. The immediate problem is to ensure a steady and continuous process of economic and social, and also in a wide sense political development among the natives, by steps which promise to lead to the realisation of this ultimate aim, and will, at any rate, not conflict with it. This means a great deal more than holding out hopes to the natives of East Africa, that at some future date one or more exceptionally qualified persons of their race may be admitted to the Legislative Council. Whatever may become possible from time to time in this way, the process to be now followed, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment is the development of native social and political institutions on native lines wherever such institutions exist, even in germ, in a form worthy of preservation. The African native thus being trained, by methods and forms of organisation which have a traditional appeal for him, may gradually develop a political consciousness and a desire to take an increasing share first of his tribal affairs and the land reserved for tribal use, and ultimately also in the governance of the territory in which he lives. The means by which this can be achieved is, as pointed out by the Closer Union Commissioners, to make the maximum use of the opportunities of self-government in tribal and local institutions, and increasingly to associate the natives with Government through local native councils. A complement to this would be the co-option, from time to time, of exceptionally advanced natives on bodies such as Native Land Boards, and ultimately, wherever possible, their admission to full membership of such Boards. An essential part of this policy would be the reference to Native Councils for their consideration of all proposals seriously or particularly affecting native interests; and the communication to the natives, through whatever organs it may be practicable to use for this purpose, of full information regarding the plans and proposals of the local Administration, and the laws which specially concern the native population. It will be the duty of the local Governments in this way to keep the native population as far as possible continuously informed, not only of the laws to which they will be subjected, but also of the principal developments of the administration. Moreover, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that at least the way should be kept.open to the possibility, at subsequent dates, of the separate administration of particular native areas, outside the limits of any considerable immigrant settlement, should this be deemed advisable.8. It is to individual well-qualified Africans that we must look also for the direct representation of natives by nomination in the Legislative Council itself. When this step will be possible it is not yet necessary to conjecture; it must depend on suitably qualified persons being available, but not less on the growth of a common feeling among East Africans to such an extent that a few African members can represent the interests of numerous and widely differing tribes, with at least as broad a view as can non-African members. But it may be anticipated that the selection of African members for nomination to the Council on some system of local, and perhaps informal, election, will precede by many years the institution of African members elected on a general vote by ballot.9.-(b.) On the social side, His Majesty&apos;s Government regard the objective to be achieved as a general improvement in the standard of native life, alike in economic conditions, in home circumstances and in the physical health of men, women and children, together with the spread of education in the widest sense. Such education should not be regarded as applicable only to children at school or youths under technical instruction, but must include such measures of adult education as may from time to time be practicable. It should go far beyond reading and writing, or any mere process of fitting individuals to carry out clerical duties, or even to attain some measure of proficiency in handicrafts; it should, as the Report of the Commission on Closer Union expresses it, aim at raising the average standard of
knowledge and of intelligence of the whole community, and achieving such an intellectual advance, as, would, in itself, gradually effect a transformation of the daily lives of the people. Education, sanitation and a progressive raising of the economic standard of life should therefore go hand-in-hand. Thus, instruction in home and personal hygiene should be seconded by efforts to improve the housing of natives, and, generally, the material surroundings in which they live, and the provision throughout the whole territory of medical facilities, hospitals and dispensaries, should be regarded as of equal importance with the supply of teachers and sehools. As in the political sphere, so in the social, it should be the aim to train the natives themselves to take an ever-increasing part, not only in the work of the educational, medical, administrative and other services alike, by filling, in such services, any posts for which individuals may increasingly become qualified, but also in the local direction of these services through the native councils already referred to.10. (c.) Turning now to the economic sphere, His Majesty&apos;s Government are of opinion that the main objective to be kept in view is the improvement of the general condition of the natives by encouraging them to make the most efficient use of theiiNown resources for purposes of production, full regard being had to the principle that the native should be in fact effectively free to work, as he may wish, either in his own tribal area, or on his own individual holding of land, or (subject to proper statutory safeguards of the conditions of employment) in labour for wages outside the tribal area. It is evident that a native&apos;s freedom to choose his form of work can be real only if land is practically as well as theoretically available, not only for tribal occupancy, but also for ownership, lease or occupation by such natives as are prepared individually to take up agriculture on their own account. Moreover, it is part of the duty of the Government to afford active assistance in improving the native methods of cultivation by appropriate training in agriculture (including the keeping of cattle), and by the effective dissemination among the adults of knowledge requisite for this purpose, and in enabling the natives to obtain a fair market for their products, especially by providing adequate means of communication and transport. These and other means of promoting the development of the resources of the territory in native occupancy or use should, in view of the large population concerned, be legarded by the Government as of primary importance.11. In considering the problem of developing native economic resources, four factors at once suggest themselves: (i) land; (ii) labour; (iii) production; (iv) taxation.12. (i.) As regards land, it is the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the first essential is to remove finally from the native mind any feeling of insecurity in regard to his tribal lands; and that land should be reserved to all the tribes of such an extent and character as will fully suffice for their actual and future needs. They therefore welcome the provision to this end which is to be made in the Kenya Native Lands Trust Bill now under consideration. They are in cordial agreement with the declaration in this Bill that the lands within the boundaries as finally gazetted for Native Reserves are reserved for the use and benefit of the natives for ever. Any derogation from this solemn pledge would, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, be not only a flagrant breach of trust, but also, in view of its inevitable effect upon the natives, a serious calamity from which the whole Colony could not, fail to suffer. His Majest3r&apos;s Government further consider that the question of native customary rights, as opposed to tribal rights in land, is one which it is becoming urgently necessary to investigate, and they are of opinion that steps to this end should be taken without delay. The legal decision that the land not specifically alienated to individual owners remains vested in the Crown does not mean, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, that the natives who have been actually using that land have no rights which the Courts of Justice must protect, but only that such customary rights have not yet been so definitely ascertained and defined that the protection of the Courts can in fact be exercised. Accordingly, the earliest possible authoritative ascertainment and definition of these customary rights of occupancy or user in land within the Native Reserves become of the utmost importance.13, The private rights just referred to are those which, according to native custom, give to the holder some degree of property in land, and benefit only a small privileged class. It is the aim of His Majesty&apos;s Government that, while those rights are recognised, every member of the tribe who wishes individually to cultivate land in the Reserve should be able to find land which he can use for the purpose. They believe that in native areas where the custom of individual tenure does not exist, this [20112] c 2
is already generally the case. Where that custom has arisen, they are confident that the legal recognition of the custom will go far to remove any reluctance felt by those who hold land under the custom to allowing the young men to obtain the use of land for individual cultivation.All these considerations involve, it will be recognised, not only early investigation, but also continuous study of all the institutions of the native communities, in order that the action taken from time to time by the Government should be based upon adequate knowledge of the native habits and customs. It must be recognised that some acquaintance with, and some training in, anthropology, particularly with reference to African conditions, has come to form a necessary part of the intellectual equipment of officers in nearly all grades of the East African Colonial service. Mnch can be done by the local administrations to encourage and promote such studies; and it is hoped also that it may be possible to increase and improve the preliminary training in anthropology which has, within the last few 3rears, been attempted on the first appointment of officers for administrative posts.14. While nothing is more important than the removal from the minds of the natives of any feeling of insecurity in their tenure of the lands&apos;definitely allocated for their occupancy and use, it cannot be ignored that the interests of the Colony or territory as a whole inevitably make necessary, from time to time, the compulsory expropriation of larger or smaller plots of land for new purposes of public utility.Parts of the area allocated for native occupancy or use, as, indeed, of other areas in the individual ownership of persons of any race, must, in the common interest, from time to time, be withdrawn from pastoral or arable use, and even from residential occupation, for conversion into roads or railways; for the erection of schools, hospitals, or police, post office and other Government buildings; for the construction of works supplying water or electricity; and for other uses of like nature. It would be idle to pretend that any land, whether in native use or occupancy or in European ownership, can remain for all time immune from such compulsory expropriation for public purposes. In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government it is of high importance that no such compulsory expropriation, however small in extent, of land once definitely allocated to native occupancy or use, whether as Native Reserves, or tribal occupancy, or individual holdings, should ever be permitted by the local administration for the mere private or personal profit or other advantage of any individual, whether of European, Indian, African or other race. Where the expropriation is required for public purposes, it should be permitted only after ample notice to the natives or other persons concerned, with a full and patient explanation of the public purpose to be served, and a formal public enquiry by some competent tribunal, which should be required to assess and determine the compensation to be made to the persons or tribes thereby deprived of what the Government had already promised to them in perpetuity. One element in the compensation should, in any other case than where land is required for the track of roads or railways, or where no more than a mere site for a building is in question, be invariably prescribed. In order that the aggregate area of land solemnly assured to the native population may not be lessened, other land of superficial extent equal to that to be compulsorily expropriated, and thus, in effect, abstracted from the area of the Native Reserves, must in every case be obtained from the areas not previously allocated to the natives, and, where practicable, placed freely at the disposal of the persons or the tribe to be extruded from their accustomed territories. Such compensation land ought, it need hardly be said, to be not only equal in superficial extent, but also, as far as possible, equal in agricultural quality, convenience and market value to that taken away. Where such complete equality cannot be ensured, it will be for the competent tribunal to assess, in addition, the pecuniary compensation, if any, required to make the expropriation equitable. Suitable additions to the award must also be made, as is customary in Europe, and as is, indeed, provided for in Kenya by the application of the Indian Land Acquisition Act, 1884, by way of compensation for disturbance, and also in order to cover the cost of reinstatement in new homes, for removal to which appropriate arrangements should always be made by the Government. Even where the allotment of the new land to the persons actually displaced is not found practicable, an equivalent addition must always be made to the Native Reserves in order that their total area may not be lessened by the expropriation for public purposes that has been found necessary in the interest of the Colony as a whole. Only on these lines, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, can those compulsory expropriations of natives, as of other lands, which are from time to time necessary in the public interest, be made to
sj-&apos; U t)seem, to the dispossessed tribes or persons, anything.but a breach of the solemn undertaking into which the Government have entered.15. It is, however, for the Government to make provision not only for the protection of the lands allocated for the occupancy or use of the native tribes or other organised native groups or communities, but also for the individual occupancy or use, by ownership or under lease, of such natives as have left their tribes and who desire to cultivate land for themselves and their families. Whilst His Majesty&apos;s Government ha,ve no desire to go back on the decision come to by Lord Elgin in 1908, confirmed by the White Paper of 1923, with regard to the restriction of land sales in the so-called Highlands of Kenya to persons of European descent, His Majesty&apos;s Government are not willing to see any restriction extended to other areas in any part of East Africa. They adhere to the principles oi equality of opportunity in the disposal of Crown lands, irrespective of race, colour or religion a principle in effect imposed in the Mandated Territory of Tanganyika on His Majesty&apos;s Government by the terms of the Mandate upon which their administration of the Territory is based, and one Avhich they have no idea of abandoning. But in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government their trusteeship for the natives involves something more than what, as it must be feared, can in most parts of East Africa for many years be little more than a theoretical equality of opportunity of natives with Europeans in the purchase of individual holdings of land. Whilst His Majesty&apos;s Government must continue to affirm the right throughout East Africa of individual natives, equally with other persons, including Indians outside the reserved parts of the Highlands of Kenya to purchase or take on lease land outside the Native Reserves, the obligation of trusteeship requires that effective opportunity should be afforded to the natives perhaps in areas outside the Native Reserves specially allocated for this purpose to take up individual holdings of appropriate extent on lease or by purchase with payment by easy instalments, for cultivation by themselves and their families, on terms that will render this policy genuinely practicable.&apos; 16. It need hardly be said that the policy of the Colonial Government as regards land should not admit of restrictions on the possession, occupation, or use of land by the natives of such a kind as, in effect, to compel them either directly or indirectly to take service for wages with private employers. It is of great importance that no Government officer should take any part in the recruiting of native labour in such a way as to lead to this fundamental policy being misunderstood.17. As the alienation of land to non-natives must, in its bearing on future native needs, assume increasing importance, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that an annual return should be furnished by the Government of Kenya to the Secretary of State showing what land included within the Native Reserves has been expropriated for other than native occupation or use, and what land outside the Reserves has been alienated, under what terms such alienation has been effected, and to whom, and what stipulations have been made in each case with a view to preventing purchase by mere speculators, and for ensuring reasonably early and adequate development by the purchasers themselves. This last point is not covered by the quarterly return of land alienations which, I observe, has recently been introduced.18. Hi.) As regards labour, reference has already been made in a preceding paragraph of this despatch to a principle to which His Majesty&apos;s Government attach great importance, namely, that the native should be effectively and economically free to work, in accordance with his own wish, either in production in the Reserves, or as an individual producer upon his own plot of land, or in employment for wages outside the Reserve, whether within the territory in which he has been resident or beyond its border, subject to the proper statutory safeguards of the conditions of employment, and for such rates of wages as may be freely contracted for. Actual -compulsion to work in private employment could, of course, in no case be contemplated. This is already forbidden by law throughout East Africa, and the ideal which His Majesty&apos;s Government haA^e in view is the gradual disappearance -of even the two cases of compulsory service AAdiich are still lawful, under severely limiting conditions, viz., compulsory labour for public services in case of emergency, and the compulsory labour for tribal services which is based on traditional tribal custom. It is essential that in these two surviving cases (which clearly do not extend to such Avork as railway construction even by the Government itself, or to employ-ment by contractors or sub-contractors on any public works), the power to call out compulsory labour should be most strictly limited to adult men in health, and not disabled by age or infirmity, and carefully safeguarded against abuse, and that any -such service should be closely regulated.   These aspects of the matter will shortly
come to be examined in greater detail in connection with the proposed Convention, under the auspices of the League of Nations, to limit and regulate the use of compulsory labour, which is now under consideration internationally, and His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore confine themselves at present to stating the above main principles.19:--(iii.) As regards production, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the natives must be allowed, subject to any necessary safeguards, in the Native Reserves or on land in individual occupation, to grow such crops and to keep such stock as they think, most profitable; but, apart from the question of ensuring the necessary local food supply, which is the first essential/ the- Government should actively encourage the production of such crops and the raising of such stocks as the native may prove best fitted in the particular circumstances to- undertake, arid such as will give him the best return for his efforts. Any proposal to prohibit the natives from engaging in any pursuit or from cultivating any kind of produce is, of course, to be deprecated, and if regulations are called for to safeguard stock or crops from disease, such regulations should apply generally to all persons without any racial distinctions. The provision of rail and road transport to ensure adequate access to markets for native just as much as for other produce must.be a primary consideration for the Government, which should use every endeavour to see that natives are in a position to obtain fair prices for their produce, and, in particular, that the pains taken by some of them in improving their methods of cultivating and in grading their products should meet with due reward in the shape of increased values. Programmes of railway and road development must take fully into con-sideration the importance of making every part of the native Reserves, equally with the Highlands, accessible to the best markets, and of meeting all reasonable native requirements for the transport of their produce. In particular, special attention should be given to the provision of additional roads within the Reserves, and to the construction of causeways or bridges in the case of existing as well as of new roads, so as to ensure as far as possible the transport of native produce irrespective of weather conditions or of seasons. His Majesty&apos;s Government take-the occasion to point out that, in so far as there may not have been in any part of the area sufficient surplus of native revenue over expenditure on native purposes to enable these transport facilities to be provided, the recent institution of the Colonial Development Fund may in future provide an opportunity for carrying them into effect, especially in relation to the provision of steelwork where required for permanent bridges.20. In addition to providing access to markets, it is necessary to ensure that natives are not, through their inexperience and the small scale of their transactions, placed at a serious disadvantage, either in the sale of their produce or in the purchase of their requirements. This end will, no doubt, ultimately be attained by the intellectual advance of the people themselves, but, in existing circumstances, a measure of supervision over the operations of traders may be essential for the prevention of abuses, and must be regarded as a necessary application of the doctrine of trusteeship.21. (iv.) Turning now to the question of taxation, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the principle to be followed is that, whilst the whole revenue of the Colony from direct taxation, by whatsoever class, vocation or race payable, ought to be assessed in proportion to the ability to pay of each family or household, the levy of direct taxation on the native should be definitely limited by his capacity to pay such imposts without hardship, and without upsetting his customary method of life. The nature of any direct taxation levied upon the natives, together with the scale on which it is assessed, should be determined primarily in accordance with this principle. It is, indeed, a positive duty of the Colonial Government to make sure that the native has an effective choice in the way in which he meets his taxes, and every care should be taken to provide that taxation, whether central or local, does not, in its result, actually oblige the native to labour for wages as the only practicable means of obtaining the money wherewith to pay his tax. On the other side of the picture; it is incumbent upon the Colonial Government to ensure that Government expenditure on native services in the Annual Budget should bear a proper relation to the revenue raised from the natives, and particularly that the native should receive directly and visibly, a fair return for the direct taxation which he is called upon to pay. This consideration is one that should constantly occupy the attention of the Colonial Government, and, to ensure that it is not lost sight of, His Majesty&apos;s Government wish that at the end of every financial year a statement should be furnished to the Secretary of State showing in detail, district by district, the total
revenue derived from the direct taxation of the natives, and the total amount expended both locally, within each native area, and in central administration upon services directly benefiting the native population. At this point His Majesty&apos;s Government think it opportune to refer to the decision, communicated to you in my despatch of , relating to Closer Union, that in future theGovernment of Kenya should forward to the Secretary of State a special annual report on the Colony, on the lines of the Report which the Government of the Tanganyika Territory furnishes annually for transmission to the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of Nations, and to point out that this Report will afford an opportunity of recording the progress made in regard to native affairs.But in addition to this general report on each territory as a whole, His Majesty&apos;s Government desire that it should be a particular obligation of the Chief Native Commissioner, or other officer holding an analogous position, to include in the report furnished annually to the Secretary of State full information under the various heads of Land, Production, Health, Education, &amp;c, in which the circumstances and the vicissitudes of the natives in the different parts of the territory are in sufficient detail described. It will be largely from these annual reports that His Majesty&apos;s Government, in the first place, and the whole world of those interested in African affairs, will be able to judge of the progress made from year to year &quot; in the training and education of the Africans towards a higher moral and economic level than that which they had reached when the Crown assumed the responsibility for the administration of this territory,&quot; to quote the terms in which the Duke of Devonshire in 1923 described the Governments task in Kenya.22. His Majesty&apos;s Government have now summarized in the brief space which a despatch of this nature allows the principles which, in their opinion, should govern the all-important question of native policy and administration primarily in Kenya, but incidentally also in East Africa generally. These principles are not new, and it is not, of course, intended to imply that they, or the ideas which inspire them, have never been applied. But, as already explained, His Majesty&apos;s Government have judged it of importance to state in a clear and comprehensive form their attitude towards this question on the occasion of the announcement of their decision on the connected question of Closer Union and the constitutional position of the Kenya Legislative Council. They are the first to recognise that no statement of policy on principles can by itself achieve results, and that progress must throughout be dependent upon the spirit in which the policy and principles are interpreted by those whose duty it is to give effect to them. His Majesty&apos;s Government know that they can unhesitatingly count upon the whole-hearted co-operation of the local Governments in East Africa in giving effect to their views, not only in the letter, but in the spirit, as the only means by which the duties of trusteeship for native welfare which the British Government has assumed can be honestly and effectively fulfilled.APPENDIX B.Explanatory Note.1. THE Commission on Closer Union in East Africa had its origin in representations made to the late Secretary of State by the Governor of Kenya, Sir Edward Grigg, in 1926 and early in 1927, regarding various difficulties in which he found himself in relation to the neighbouring territories. He urged that some measure of federation or closer union was essential in order to provide a means of dealing with questions of conflict of interest between the territories. He also drew attention to the artificial character of the constitution of Kenya, where it was essential, as a matter of practical working, to pay close heed to the views of the representatives of the politically educated European community, and to the -consequent necessity of investing that community with some share in the government-of the country, in order that the views of their representatives might be put forward with a due sense of, responsibility.2. The report of the Commission has given us a very valuable exposition of the essentials of native policy in East Africa, but it is necessary that we should not let this factor, vitally important as it is, obscure the issue on the points which gave birth to the Commission.
3. The desirability of separating the railway working in Kenya and Uganda from the finances of Kenya, in order to preserve the interests of Uganda as the chief customer of the line, led to the setting up of a High Commissioner of Transport with an advisory Railway Board, and the post of High Commissioner was assigned to the Governor of Kenya. Sir E. Grigg represented that the arrangement was unsatisfactory, as, even if the views of the High Commissioner are not influenced by the interests of Kenya, any decision unacceptable to Uganda is regarded there as an indication of partiality.4. Sir E. Grigg also pointed out that differences had arisen in operating the Customs Union between the three dependencies and in regard to railway working at the points of contact of the Kenya-Uganda and Tanganyika systems.5. In 1926 the first Conference was held of the Governors of the dependencies in East and Central Africa. Here, again, Sir E. Grigg found his position as Chairman very difficult in view of his close interest, as Governor of Kenya, in the subjects under discussion.6. It was in these circumstances that Mr. Amery decided to take up the question of closer union in East Africa, and it is indeed clear tnat there is no permanent means of providing for the local settlement of differences short of the appointment of a local official charged with the administration of railway, customs, and other services of common interest, who would also be the chairman of the Governors&apos; Conference, and by virtue of his independent position be able to guide discussion, reconcile differences, and place before the Secretary of State such differences as he found to be locally irreconcilable, without any partiality or suspicion of partiality.7. As regards the constitution of Kenya, difficulties arose very soon after the-grant of elective institutions which followed the war, and which was to a large extent a recognition of the notable services which the European community in Kenya had rendered during the war. There was from the beginning a tendency, accentuated by the arrival of post-war settlers, to resent the authority of the Secretary of State, and to regard the elected members as a &quot; permanent opposition,&quot; an attitude which was strengthened when occasion arose to insist on the use of the official majority in the Council. Endeavours have been made by Governors to break down this feeling by taking elected members into consultation. This tendency has perhaps been carried too far, and we have Select Committees of the Council with an unofficial majority whose recommendations are accepted apparently automatically by the full Council. There is much to be said for Sir E. Grigg&apos;s view that the present position is dangerous, and that it is essential that the unofficial section of the Legislative Council should be taught to realise that they share the responsibility of the Government for the good administration of the country.
The accompanying Cabinet Paper should be substituted for that, bearing the same number, CP. 309, circulated recently. ;l
