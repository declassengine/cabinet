Hours of work below ground,II.    State acquisition of coal royalties,  and.    Regulation of output and sale.I. With regard to hours of work be-low ground, the proposal is to reduce the maximum period allowed by law by half an hour a day from Monday, 6th April next.II. With regard to State acquisition of coal royalties, It is proposed to provide for the gradual acquisition by the State of the mineral rights In coal and other minerals necessarily worked with coal.     Under this proposal the State would have the exclusive right in future to grant rights to work coal, and it would also have the right to&apos; take over the ownership of coal areas now being worked under existing grants as and when it sees that any practical   advantage is likely to enure to the industry.Compensation at market value would be payable to the owners of the property when it  is acquired, but no compensation would be payable in the future for any coal which has no market value at the present time. Provision would be made to secure, amongst other things, that all surface and other rights reasonably required to work and market the coal could be obtained,,III. With regard to the regulation of output and sale, it is proposed to take powers to establish schemes dealing with these matters and to put all collieries under a statutory obligation to conform with the terms ofsuch schemes0Provision would be made for the establishment of a scheme for each district and also for an Inter-district or central scheme to co-ordinate the whole.

Provision would also be made for the purchase or transfer of quotas.(b)  Regulation of price.(i)     It is proposed that, any district  scheme may include proposals for the regulation of the price of coal by means of the classification of the coal produced in the district and by the determination from time to time of the class into which any coal produced in the district fr.lls and the       /
minimum price at which each class of coal may be sold. If price regulation is included in a scheme, by resolution of a majority calculated upon output, and the scheme is approved., the observance of the price regulations would then be obligatory on all coal owners in ihe district.(ii)       Provision would also be made in the inter-district scheme for the co-ordination of prices and conditions of sale as between districts on application from any district0(o) Power to grant financial, assistance to the export trade or other se colons &apos; &quot;of the^&apos;coa.1 traae*&apos;&apos;by means of * a levy upon output in the inter-district scheme provision may be made for the grant of financial assistance to export coal or other sections of the coal trade by means of a levy on output over the whole country.(d) Machinery for^reference of matters in dispute, to arbitration,,(i)     In every district scheme there would have to be machinery approved by the Board of Trade for the appointment of an independent arbitrator or arbitrators, whose decision will be final, to whom colliery owners may appeal against any decision of a district committee as to the terms and conditions upon which conformity with the principles of approved schemes 13 required.(ii)       A similar provision would be made in the inter-district scheme for appeals by Districts against&quot;a decision of the inter-district committeen(e ) Penalties0Provision would be made in every district,scheme and the inter-district scheme for monetary or other penalties for contravention or failure to comply with any of the provisions of the schemes.(f) Re pre sent at.I on of worxpe ople an d ^ cone umers.(i)     In each district, It is proposed that there should be constituted a committee consisting ofone coal ownerone coal miner and two representatives of consumers with an independent chairman, to consider the operation of the scheme and advise the Board of Trade, from time ;o time, of any action taken which in their view is contrary to the best interests of the community, including consumers of coal and workpeople engaged in the coal industry,,    These ComvuVttees would be given access to all the relevant information necessary to carry out their functionac

George Street, Westminster, S.W.1 3Cth October,  1929.Dear Mr. Cook,With reference to your letter of 29th October and in accordance with the promise made to the Officials of the Miners&apos; Federation oh Friday last, I now enclose the proposals of the Government in regard to the Mining Industry.      While of course it is understood that the members of your Executive Committee will be supplied with copies of the proposals, you will appreciate- that the document must be treated as strictly confidential until the Government have announced their coalispolicy in the House of Commons.      This/of course only the first instalment of the government&apos;s coal policy.As regards the second paragraph of your letter the Government intend, as soon as the legislation now under consideration has been disposed of,  to proceed with measures for the further re-organisation of the industry, followed by a further reduction of hours as soon as economic conditions permit the answer to the third and fourth paragraphs of your letter is that one of the objects of the Government in framing their proposals in respect of the Mining Industry has-, been to secure the maximum reduction of hours which in their opinion the industry can bear without the necessity for a reduction in wages, but that the actual settlement of wages must remain, as at present, a matter for arrangement between the employers&apos;  and workmenTs representatives.The Government have endeavoured to bring about national wages negotiations,  and have urged this upon the owners at every opportunity.      They regret that up to the present their efforts have been without success, but they will continue their attempt to bring the two parties together.Yours faithfully,(Sd)    WILLIAM GRAHAM.   .J.
