jeei-3 document io the prop^rsy op his britannic MajE&amp;days government.(Circulated by direct ion of the Minister of Labour with the concurrence of the Chancellor of the &apos; Exchequer)*1.     On 22nd October, 1929 the Cabinet referred it to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour (Cabinet 40 (29) conclusion No.l):-(a) to examine -whether means could be found to make some reduction in the waiting period whioh is at present six days;(b) to consider the Minister&apos;s proposal to improve the benefit scales of persons aged 17, 18 and 19;(c) to consider whether the clause giving general authority to provide training and removal expenses should be included in the Bill.2.     The present Government have already taken two steps to improve the finance of the Unemployment Fund in order to ensure continued payment of benefit.     They are as follows:-(a)  3,500,000 has been added to the annual revenue of the Fund by making the Exchequer contribution equal to one half of the combined contribution of employers and employed as from 12th April, 1929;(b) it has been agreed that the Exchequer shall bear as from April next the cost of the extension of the &quot;transitional&quot; period during which the 30 contribution condition is in abeyance.     This will involve  2,500,000 to  2,000,000 in the first year and  5,000,000 to  6,000,000 per annum afterwards.SSORiJff0 A B 1 I E S. -UNjMPLQYMENT INSURANCE BILL (No.2) 1929.G^7 98(29)MEMORANDUM OF THE DECISIONS OF THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER AND THE MINISTER Off LABOUR 0N* POINTS REFERRED  0 THEM./referring
3. Referring to these steps the Minister of Labour said inparagraph 11 of her main memorandum on the Unemployment Inaua^aivee Bill - CP.279 (29) - that &quot;large as are the additions made  (to revenue) it is by no means certain that the total revenue will be sufficient to enable the Fund to continue to meet charges now-existing, and I am considering with the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether and to what extent additional money must be provided for this purpose&apos;&quot;&apos;.(a ) The Cabinet agreed on 22nd October to abolish the &quot;genuinely seeking work&quot; condition and to make certain other provisions in that connectionj also to abolish suspension of benefit in this type of cases and certain other cases of a similar kind.       The cost of these changes is not susceptible of close estimation but It may be taken as adding  2,000,000, to the existing charges on the Fund.(b) The cost of the improved scales of benefit for young persons proposed by the Minister of Labour will be  400,OCG per annum.       This may be offset by a surplus of revenue from the proposed Insurance of persons between the ages of 15 and 16, but this would only       operate as from April 1931.(c) To reduce the waiting period from six days to three would cost from  2,000,000 to  3,000,000 and just possibly more depending on the extent to which the proposal brings additional people on to the Live Register.5. Sven with the additions already made as stated inparagraph 2 above the revenue of the Unemployment Fund is Insufficient to meet its existing charges without making any provision for repayment of debt and its borrowing powers are likely to be exhausted before the end of the winter.       The additional charges to which the Cabinet has agreed - (a) above - make additional money still more necessary./The

This will add a further sum of- -from  X,500,000 to  3,000,000 to -the charge on the Exchequer this financial year and a similar further sum next year. The total contribution from the Exchequer to the Fund will thus be about  18,500,000 this year and  21,500,000 next year as compared with  1&amp;,000,000 provided by the&apos; previous Government for the Current Year.7.       Allowing for this increase in revenue and for the improved scales of benefit for young persons - to which the Chancellor is prepared to agree - as well as for the changes already approved by the Cabinet the debt on the Fund may well approach near to the statutory limit ( 40,000,000) by the end of the winter but it is not likely actually to reach it. With reasonable luck the Fund should be able to carry on till the end of next year.     On the other hand should there be some industrial catastrophe, further emergency legislation might be unavoidable in order to ensure continued payment of benefit.8. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has come to theconclusion that he cannot agree to any increase in the Exchequer Charge over and above these large sums and it is accordingly not possible to provide for the reduction of the waiting period to 3 days.     Greatly as she would like to see the reduction made, the Minister of Labour has reluctantly come to the1&apos; conclusion that in the circumstances she cannot press for the additional  2,000,000 to  3,000,000 which would be required.
9.      In-order to ensure that the Unemployment Fund can carry-on during the Christmas recess, the Unemployment Insurance Bill must become law before the recess and a Supplementary Estimate must be voted.10.    As regards the proposed clause for giving general authority to provide training and removal expenses the Chancellor acquiesced in the view of the Minister that the inclusion of this clause, which is in reality somewhat outside the scope of the Bill, would add greatly to the difficulties in the house, and that therefore it should be postponed till a later occasion.29th Ootober, 1929.
