(c) That,  in order to ensure that the Delegates should be able to obtain some guidance at short notice in cases where there was no time to consult the Cabinet,  the following Ministers should act as a Committee to confer with thems.-The Lord Chancellor.The Lord President of the Council.The Lord Privy Seal.(e) That the. Lord President of the&apos; Council should arrange with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs fov some form cf representation at the Conference of the Privy Council, whether by watching-brief or otherwise, whenever matt ers affecting the Council or the Judicial Committee were liable to arise.&quot; (2)      The Terms of Reference of the Conference are as follows &quot;To enquire into, report upon,  and make recommendations concerning:--&quot;(i) Existing statutory provisions requiring reservation of Dominion legislation-2-in regard to any problems that might arise, he should be careful not to commit the Government at the present stage&quot;.
for the assen  of His Majesty or authorising the disallowance of such legislation.&quot;(ii)  -  (a) The present position as to the competence of Dominion Parliaments to give their - legislation extra-territorial operation.(b)  The practicability and most convenient method of giving effect to the principle that each Dominion Parliament should have power to give extra-territorial operation to its legislation in all cases where such operation is ancillary to pro-vision for the peace, order, and good government cf the Dominion.&quot;(iii)  The principles embodied in or underlying the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, and the extent to which any provisions of that Act ought to be repealed, amended, or modified in the light of the existing relations between the various members of the British Commonwealth of Nations as described in this Reppht;.&apos;1
It should be noted that matters affecting the Privy Council are not mentioned in the Terms of Reference.      This was recognised by the Attorney General in his speech on the opening day  (page 10 rf the verbatim    notes.)The question (*f an Imperial Court cannot be considered -without involving the position of the Privy Council and the Judicial Committee.      This being the case, I desire to suggest to my colleagues that before any further steps are taken on this Important matter, there should be oi)pertunity for the fullest consideration^  and I should like to have time to bring a comprehensive Memorandum before the Cabinet.The questions involved are likely to come up at the next Imperial Conference, and there appears to be no sufficient ground for anticipating the vvork of the Imperial Conference now, especially when there have been no preliminary discussions with the Department immediately concerned.(Intd,)    PoOctober 21st,  1929;
