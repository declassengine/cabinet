October 29th, 1929.
9d) ej i]Purvey of Social Insurance Schea^a&amp;.During recent years we have developed a -complex system of social insurance,  covering a large proportion of the population, side by side with the social -sea      ss.I will not weary the House with any -detailed reoital of the schemes now in operation.      It will be sufficient to remind hand. Members of the National     &quot;.1th Insurance Acts, the Widows&apos;$ Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act,  the non-contributory Old Age Pensions Act:;, 1908 to 1924, the Unemployment Insurance Act and the provision made for War pensions.    But these national schemes do not complete the story.     We have our Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts and similar measures, and special legislation dealing with the superannuation of various kinds of public servants employed by local authorities.There are important differences in scope between the Health and Unemployment Insurance Schemes a- but in so far as the same or  similar problems arise under both schemes the closest touch, is kept between the Ministries of Health and Laboureog.  in determining questions of insurability, and in enforcing compliance with the statutory provisions as to payment of contributions a single joint administration of both schemes is in force.The Health Insurance and Contributory Pensions schemes are closely interlocked as regards range of insurance and. the collection of contributions, but in the fundamental matters of finance and general organisation the schemes already referred to are quite distinct from one another.Bach of these schemes was designed to provide for a particular contingency as the need, or demand, for such provision became apparent and as a consequence different
ft 91&apos;(fc.v X,principles have entered into the conception of setteispss providing for closely related forms of need and diff,   .. forms of administrative machinery have been set sap for se-which are broadly similar in purpose.In the opinion of the Government,, the Miob &apos;rx   arrived when we should take stock of the existing system of soc ial insurance, and a Committee of the Cabinet is r- / upona survey of the various schemes, an analysis of the complex problems to which schemes developed on independ-&apos;,    Ij inevitably give rise, an examination of the gaps and inadequacies in the present schemes, and a cons id ofthe relations between insurance and other forms of social provision.The three major problems to which the Government is giving its attention in the various fields of social Insurance are -(1)    the inclusion of classes of persons whblly or partially excluded from existing schemes;(2)    the extension of the existing services;(3)    the financial aspects of social insurance..The demands for the inclusion of a larger number of persons within the range of Social Insurance are increasing in strength and volume, partly as a result of the greater complexity and stress of modern industrial life, and partly because of the growing recognition of the advantages which have accrued to the workers by association in insurance^ supplemented by the financial Intervention of the State.Added force has boon imparted to these demands by the passage of the Contributory Pensions Act, 1925, largely by reason of the exclusion from that Act.of many persons of small means who are no better able than the insured classes to make
eJ ti &amp;independent provision for themselves.The Bill before the House only profe o deal with,the more important problems affecting the It i class arising out of the Act of 1925.       The other and larrc h beleft to the Special Committee of the Cabinfl.*As regards the Pensions Scheme a numl fieultpoints arise in oonneotion with What seem to be -,!.haru o ;   :-;; . For instance, I may refer to the deserted wife,, t --.1.14husband, and the elderly spinster.     These and ether points which have &quot;been tabulated will require careful .cone!deration.In oonneotion with Unemployment Insurance the Committee will have to consider the question of the ex&apos;      itsa of the scheme to other classes of persons not at present included but covered by the Health Insurance Scheme, e,g. agricultural workers.A question of first-class importar.ee in connection with all the various schemes of social insurance is that of determining how far persons, who have failed to keep up their contributions by reason of prolonged unemployment san be regarded as proper subjects for insurance and in tho event of their protection by insurance having to lapse what arrangements should be made for thorn in periods of sickness and unemployment,I may illustrate the question of the extension of the services provided by a reference to the recommendations of the Royal Ccmmi3sion on National Health Insurance and the moro recent report of the Departmental Committee on the Training of liidwivea which point to an extension of the services now provided under the National Health insurance Ao t s,
q eht)       c)Amongst the most important of the par which will need consideration mention may &quot;be x (a)^    the provision of medical and midwife:during pregnancy and at ohildbirth^^^^t       -fp&amp;n and the wives of insured men;(b) the extension bf the scope of medical o include speoialiat and consultant-moand laboratory aids to diagnosis;(c) the possibility of making dental benefit benefit for all insured persons;(d) the provision of allowances to the dependa sick insured persons.In the third place as Hon. Members will readily realise any extension, development or increase of social insurance benefits involves weighty financial considerations.The task of overhauling our systems of social insuranoe is one, therefore, of considerable complexity and magnitude.     But the desire of the Government is to build by stages towards a comprehensive, adequate, and harmonious system of social insurance which will enable the citizen -effectively to meet the ills, misfortunes and risks of life.
