SHINWELL.* The War Office,11th October, 1929.MEMORANDUM BY THE ARMY COUNCIL.1. In view of the statement made by the British Delegate, at the last assembly of the League- of Nations, announcing the intention of the Government to ratify the Convention for the Supervision of the International Trade in Arms and Ammunition and in Implements of War, the Army Council desire to offer certain observations.2. The principal objects of this Convention are two in number. The first is to prohibit transactions in war materiel, except by licence from the Governments of both the exporting and importing countries. The second is to ensure that the details of all such transactions are published by the Governments concerned. The Army Council have always been anxious that these objects should be fully realized and the Convention become effective. It will establish more satisfactory conditions for the international trade in war materiel, and will do much to restrain the illicit traffic in arms which lies at the root of many frontier problems in various parts of the Empire.3. The Army Council point out however that the effect of the Convention, when operative, will be that imports of war materiel by non-producing States will be given wide publicity and their position as regards the equipment of their forces accurately disclosed to the world at large.It cannot be doubted that the non-producing States will invariably prefer to avoid publicity by placing their orders with those producing States which remain outside the Convention, rather than disclose information of vital importance to themselves by placing orders with producing States which have bound themselves to give publicity to such transactions. So long as any producing State withholds ratification, the main object of the Convention will be unattained and the States which have ratified will be exposed to the loss of their trade.4. By Article 41, the Convention does not become operative until it has been ratified by a minimum of fourteen States. But as soon as fourteen States have deposited their ratifications, the Convention will become operative irrespective of whether this number includes the principal arms producing States throughout the world.(B29/17)   75   10/29   w.o.p.   4698
5. At least twelve States habitually export to other countries arms and ammunition of one kind or another, though not all are capable of producing every description of war materiel. A number of other States are capable of producing war materiel of various kinds for their own use, and though they have seldom exported materiel in the past are likely before long to be in a position to do so. It is to be noted that, of the seven &quot;* States which have already ratified the Convention, four are non-producing States. There is little doubt therefore that by the time fourteen States have ratified the Convention and its provisions are brought into force, a number of producing States will still be excluded from its scope. This appears to be the more probable, inasmuch as only three producing States have so far ratified the Convention, and two of importance The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Czecho-Slovakia have not as yet even signed it.6. Such a situation could hardly fail to involve the complete destruction of the British trade in war materiel. It would inevitably be accompanied by very large unemployment among the woz*k people concerned. Nor does it appear that these serious consequences would be offset by any real contribution to world disarmament. In order, not only to safeguard the interests of our trade and our work people, but to render the Convention itself effective in operation, the Army Council are strongly of opinion that this country should not ratify this Convention until simultaneous ratification by all the principal arms producing States has been assured.
