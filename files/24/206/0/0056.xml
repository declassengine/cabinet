THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1929.SECRET. Copy No.    3 cp. 309 (29).CABINET.PALESTINE: THE WAILING WALL.I CIRCULATE a memorandum on this subject which has been prepared in the Colonial Office. On the whole I think that it would be best to take steps for the appointment of an ad hoc Commission as the equivalent, for the special purpose in view, of a Commission appointed under Article 14 of the Mandate. I understand that a feasible and expeditious procedure to ensure that its appointment would be acceptable to the Council of the League of Nations would be for the opinion of the Permanent Mandates Commission, now in session, to be sought at the earliest opportunity. If the opinion of the Mandates Commission should, as is hoped, be favourable, the President of the Council could then be invited, in view of the urgency of the matter, to approve the proposal in the name of the Council in anticipation of their confirmation at their January session. The President would probably wish to consult his colleagues in writing before so approving. On previous similar occasions the President has put a proposal to his colleagues in writing with an intimation that if no protest is received within, say, a fortnight, their approval would be assumed. So no great delay need be anticipated. If the above course should be agreed upon, I think that the composition of the Commission should be left to the Chairman of the Council to decide, in the light of any opinion expressed by the Permanent Mandates Commission, but that the name of Sir Cecil Hurst should be suggested as Chairman. It might be desirable to intimate to the Chairman that His Majesty&apos;s Government would prefer that the members of the Commission should be chosen as impartial persons, and not in any way as representing the different racial or religious interests.Should our efforts to secure the acceptance by the Council of the League of such a Commission be unsuccessful, it would still be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to set up an ad hoc Commission on its own authority, as contemplated in paragraph 9 of the memorandum.P.Colonial Office, November 8, 1929.[20113]B
SECRET.PALESTINE:   THE WAILING WALL.Memorandum.WITH&apos; his Memorandum, dated the 6th September, on the situation in Palestine (CP. 241 (29)), the Secretary of State circulated, as Appendix II to the Memorandum, a copy of a telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine, dealing with the question of the determination of the rights and claims of Moslems and Jews at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. In that telegram Sir John Chancellor expressed the view that the claims of both parties were irreconcilable, and stated that he was satisfied that no ruling by him or by any person or body in Palestine at that time would be accepted by either party.2. At the Cabinet Meeting which considered the above Memorandum, it was decided that, as regards the Wailing Wall, the Secretary of State for the Colonies should invite the High Commissioner to draw up, and report for approval, detailed plans for the preservation of order at the Wailing Wall on Yom Kippur (the Jewish Day of Atonement). The detailed plans subsequently submitted by the High Commissioner and approved by the Secretary of State included, in addition to special police and military dispositions in Jerusalem, the issue of instructions to the Police setting out the facilities which would be accorded to Jewish worshippers at the Wailing Wall pending the final determination and definition of Jewish and Moslem rights there. A copy of the instructions as issued is annexed (Appendix I). These instructions were communicated to the Jewish and Moslem authorities, with an intimation that they were issued in the interests of good order and decorum, and that the Government would be responsible for their observance. It was also explained that the instructions were provisional, and that they would not prejudice the existing rights and claims of Jews and Moslems in regard to the Wall, measures for the authoritative determination of which were then under consideration. In spite of this explicit assurance, both the Moslem and Jewish authorities protested against the temporary instructions. The Moslems asserted that they allowed certain privileges to which the Jews were not entitled, and that the instructions constituted an infraction of existing rights, as indicated in Mr. Amery&apos;s Memorandum on the Wailing Wall, dated the 19th November, 1928, which was laid before Parliament as a White Paper (Command 3229 copy annexed, Appendix II).3. The Jewish authorities objected to the instructions on the ground that they violated their religious sentiments. Sir John Chancellor informed the two parties that the instructions must stand pending the authoritative determination of their respective rights. At the same time, the High Commissioner telegraphed to the Secretary of State, laying emphasis on the urgent need for the appointment of an authoritative body to study, define and determine the rights and claims of Moslems and Jews at the Wailing Wall. In this telegram (No. 252 of the 15th October, copy attached, Appendix III) Sir John Chancellor expressed the view that, until a statement could be made of the early appointment of such a body, tranquillity could not be restored in Palestine. In a subsequent telegram (No. 264 of the 19th October, copy annexed, Appendix IV), on the situation in Palestine, he reported that one of the chief factors enabling the ill-disposed to keep public opinion inflamed, and causing perturbation among the ignorant Arab masses, was the delay in settling the Wailing Wall question; and he urged that the proposed settlement should not be deferred for more than a week. Sir John Chancellor was informed in reply that it was not possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to arrive at an early decision on the [20113] b 2
proposal, which. raised issues of a delicate and complicated nature; but that the difficulties of his position were appreciated and that he might rest assured that this consideration would be borne in mind.4. It is most desirable that the question of the method to be adopted for obtaining a final determination of the whole controversy should be decided as early as possible. The High Commissioners proposal is that a Commission should be appointed, under Article 14 of the Palestine Mandate, to study, define and determine the rights and claims of Moslems and Jews in connection with the Wall. It may be convenient briefly to recall the circumstances leading up to this proposal. Following on the incidents at the Wailing Wall on the Day of Atonement in 1928, to which reference is made in Mr. Amery&apos;s Memorandum of the 19th November, 1928 (Appendix II), the Palestine Government made every effort to facilitate an agreement between the Jews and Moslems which would minimise the risk of disputes and incidents at the Wall in the future. Their efforts, however, met with no success, and it became evident that steps would have to be taken to define and determine the rights of the respective parties at the Wall. It was originally proposed that this should be done by introducing legislation enabling the Government of Palestine to discharge the responsibility assumed by the Mandatory under Article 13 of the Mandate. The High Commissioner would then enact regulations defining and determining Moslem and Jewish rights a.t the Wailing Wall. This decision was reached before the disturbances started on the 23rd August, and Sir John Chancellor on his return to Palestine in September expressed the opinion that, in view of the recent events, the above proposal was no longer adequate, and that no act of the Palestine Government purporting to be declaratory as to rights or practice would be regarded as authoritative unless it were based on the finding of a-commission of enquiry commanding general confidence both in Palestine and abroad in respect of its composition and procedure. The High Commissioner accordingly recommended the appointment of a Commission, under the terms of Article 14 of the Palestine Mandate, to deal, not with the whole question of Holy Places in Palestine, as contemplated in that article, but solely with the specific question of the Wailing Wall.5.   It may be convenient to quote the text of Article in full: &apos;&apos; A special Commission shall be appointed by the Mandatory to study, define and determine the rights and claims in connection with the Holy Places and the rights and claims relating to the different religious communities in Palestine. The method of nomination, the composition and the functions of this Commission shall be submitted to the Council of the League for its approval, and the Commission shall not be appointed or enter upon its functions without the approval of the Council.&quot;6. The Holy Places Commission contemplated in the Article has never, in fact, been set up. Proposals for its constitution were drawn up in 1922, but they were found to be unacceptable to the Catholic powers represented on the Council of the League of Nations, and were subsequently withdrawn by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment. Lord Balfour, at a meeting of the Council held on the 4th October, 1922, referred to the difficulties which had arisen on account of disagreement between the Catholic Powers themselves, and expressed the view that he was not capable of suggesting a remedy for these difficulties, which must be settled between the Powers concerned themselves. Nothing has since occurred to modify the position as described by Lord Balfour in 1922. It is clearly impracticable to settle the Wailing Wall question by setting up a Holy Places Commission, comprehensive in its scope, in the terms of Article 14 of the Mandate. Even if it were&apos;certain that the difficulties of constituting such a Commission could be overcome, the delay involved by this procedure would be far too great. In view, however, of the circumstances surrounding the Wailing Wall, question (which concerns no religious communities other than Jews and Mohammadans), it is unlikely that the difficulties which have prevented the setting up of a Holy Places Commission on the lines contemplated in the Mandate would also prevent the appointment of a special Commission under Article 14 with the limited terms of reference proposed. There is, nevertheless, the possibility that the Catholic powers represented on the Council might object to the proposal on the ground that it might prejudice the choice of personnel for the full Commission ultimately to be appointed; or they might find other means of obstructing the proposal.   The hostility with which the Vatican is understood to
regard the Zionist movement, and in consequence the Palestine mandate, is a factor that cannot be lost sight of. The necessity of referring the proposals to the Council of the League of Nations would, in any case, entail some delay in the appointment of the Commission, which, in view of the present situation, might have unfortunate results.7. The High Commissioners view as to the inadequacy in present circum-stances of the original proposal is borne out, to some extent, by the protests to which the temporary instructions mentioned above have given rise. It is difficult to judge how far these protests were encouraged by the temporary nature of the instructions. In the present temper of Jews and Moslems in Palestine, any action of importance taken by the Administration inevitably produces a crop of protests. But the High Commissioner evidently feels strongly on the subject, and has considered it necessary in an official communique issued in Palestine to make a specific reference to his proposal for the appointment of an authoritative body. To that extent, we may be said to be committed to a Commission of some kind.8. If the High Commissioner^ views on this point are not accepted and the original proposal for local legislation is adopted, it might no doubt be possible to effect the final determination of Jewish and Moslem rights at the Wailing Wall at a comparatively early date. But this course carries with it the risk, apparently by no means negligible, &apos;of provoking a recurrence of the disturbances; and it is a matter for consideration whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would be justified in taking such a risk in the face of Sir J. Chancellor&apos;s strong view-s on the subject, and having regard to the protests with which the temporary instructions issued by the High Commissioner have been met. Further, in view of the High Commissioners public announcement of his recommendation, he would be placed in an awkward position if he had to announce that his proposal had not been approved and that he had been instructed to settle the matter himself by local enactment.9. Another alternative would be for His Majesty&apos;s Government to appoint an ad hoc Commission for this purpose, without reference to Article 14 of the Mandate. The disadvantage of this course would appear to be that, in view of the terms of that article (quoted at the end of paragraph 3), its findings would necessarily lack finality unless and until they Avere confirmed by a body recognised by the League of Nations as the Holy Places Commission provided for in the Mandate. It is for con-sideration whether Plis Majesty&apos;s Government should not attempt to meet this difficulty by an intimation to the Council of the League that circumstances have rendered the appointment of an authoritative body a matter of urgency, and that, unless the Council is able, within a stated period, to accept the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government as fulfilling the requirements of Article 14 in so far as rights and claims in connection Avith the Wailing Wall are concerned, Plis Majesty&apos;s Government have no alternative but to proceed with the setting up of such a Commis-sion Avithout further delay as the only practicable means of dealing Avith a situation which cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely in view of the responsibility of the mandatory Power for the maintenance of peace, order and good government in Palestine.10. If a Commission is appointed, the question of its composition will present some difficulty. Sir J. Chancellor has. suggested a body consisting of three &quot; completely impartial men of British nationality,&quot; and has mentioned the name Of Sir Cecil Hurst as a suitable chairman. Whether the League Avould be prepared to appoint an &quot;all-British&quot; Commission of this kind may be open to doubt. An American element would have much to commend it; but any American, Avhatever his position or record, would almost certainly be suspected by the Arabs of Zionist prejudice. In the same Avay, any Roman Catholic, or subject of a Roman Catholic PoAver, would be regarded by the Jews as anti-Zionist. There may be something to be said for direct Jewish and Mohammadan representation on the Commission, but it Avould destroy all hope of a unanimous report. On the Avhole, if the League can be got to agree, an all-British (Protestant) Commission seems to be the best expedient.Middle East Department,Colonial Office, November    ,1929.

THE WESTERN OR WAILING WALL IN JERUSALEM.(Memorandum by the Secretary&apos; of State for the Colonies.)The incidents which have given rise to the Jewish complaints and to questions in Parliament are described in the following communique, which was issued by the Palestine Government on the 23 th of September last : . &quot; On the evening of the 23rd September, the eve of the Day of Atonement, a complaint was made to the Deputy District Commissioner, Jerusalem, by the Mutawali of.the Abu Madian Waqf, in which the pavement and the whole area around the Western or Wailing Wall is vested, to the effect that a dividing screen had been affixed to the pavement adjoining the Wall, and that other innovations had-been made in the established practice, such, as the introduction of additional petrol lamps, a number of mats, and a tabernacle or ark much larger than was customary. The Deputy District Commis-sioner visited the Wall during the evening&quot; service, and, acting in accordance with the practice established by Government, decided that the screen would have to be removed before the service on the following day. He gave instructions accordingly to the beadle in charge of the arrangements for the conduct of the services at the Wall, reserving his decision in the matter of the lamps, the mats, and the ark. The beadle undertook to remove the screen and the Deputy District Commissioner gave him until early the following morning to do so. The Deputy District Commissioner accepted the beadle&apos;s assurance that his instructions would be carried out, at the same time informing the British Police Officer on duty that in the event of &quot;the beadle not complying with his undertaking the screen was to be removed.On the following morning the Police Officer visited the Wall and, finding that the screen had not been removed, asked members of the congregation present to take it away; they replied that they were unable to move it because of the holiness of the day. The Police therefore removed the screen them-- selves. The worshippers in general, unaware of the circum-stances that had gone before and seeing only the Police in the act of removing the screen which had been used to separate the men and the women, became excited and some of them endeavoured by force to prevent the screen being taken away. Ultimately the screen was removed.The importation of .the- screen and its attachment to the pavement constituted an infraction of the status quo, which the Government were unable to permit. At the same time the Government deeply deplore the shock that was caused to large
numbers of religious people on a day so holy to -Jews. Govern-naent understand that the beadle responsible for the innovations-iion wMcli caused, the incident lias been dealt with by the Jewish authorities, and on their side have impressed on the Jewish authorities the need, manifested in connexion with the incidents at the Wall in 1922 and 192-5 and again on this occa-sion, for prior- consultation with the proper officers of Govern-ment as to the arrangements for the services at the Wall on the principal Jewish holidays.2fo Jewish Police Officer was present at the Wall on the occasion in question owing to all -Jewish officers in Jerusalem Laving been excused doty for the Day of Atonement. Govern- Beat will, however, consider, the desirability of a responsible -Jewish Officer being included in future among the officers de-tailed for doty at the Wail on solemn Jewish holy days.In conclusion. Government consider that the removal of the screen was necessary, but regret ail the circumstances attending: that removal.&quot;It will be seen that the intervention of the police was caused by an act of the Jewish authorities, which was regarded by the Pales-tine Government as constituting an infraction of the stains quo. Before proceeding to an explanation of the status quo as it appears to the Palestine Government and His majesty&quot;s Government, ii is necessary to state briefly the position as it existed before the British Administration was set up in Palestine.The Western or Wailing Wall formed part of the western exterior of the ancient Jewish Temple; as such, it is holy to the Jewish community, and their custom of preying there extends back to the Middle Ages and possibly further. The Wall is also part, of the Haram-al-Sharif; as such, it is holy to Moslems. Moreover, it is legally the absolute property of the Moslem community, and the strip of pavement facing it is Waqf property, as is shown by documents preserved by the Guardian of the Waqf. The Jewish community have established an undoubted right of access to the pavement for the purposes of their devotions but, whenever protests were made by. the Moslem authorities, the Turkish authorities repeatedly ruled that they would not permit such departures from the existing practice as the bringing of chairs and benches to the pavement. It is understood that a ruling prohibiting the bringing of screens to the pavement was given in 1912.The Palestine Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government, having in mind the terms of Article 13 of the Mandate for Palestine, have taken the view that the matter is. one in which they are bound to maintain the status quo, which they have regarded as being, in general terms, that the Jewish community have a right of access to the pavement for the purposes of their devotions, but may bring to the Wall only those appurtenances of worship which were permitted
under the Turkish regime. Whenever the Moslem authorities have preferred complaints that innovations have been made in the estab-lished practice, and the Palestine Government on enquiry have satisfied themselves that the complaints were well-founded, they have felt it their duty to insist that the departures from practice which gave rise to the complaints should be discontinued.An incident which occurred in September, 1926, when the authorities in Palestine had to remove seats and benches brought to the Wall, formed one of the subjects of a memorandum addressed by the President of the Zionist Organisation through His Majesty&apos;s Government to the League of Nations in May, 1926. The con-clusion of both the Permanent Mandates Commission and the Council of the League was that a solution of the difficulties could only be found by agreement, thus endorsing the comment of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the memorandum, which was that the dispute could not be settled except by common consent. The Palestine Government, though prepared, if approached by both parties, to act as intermediaries, felt that the matter was one which could best be settled by consent between the communities con-cerned. Neither party, in fact, approached the Palestine Govern-ment and that Government is not aware of any negotiations having been initiated between the parties.From the official communique issued by the Palestine Govern-ment it will be seen and, so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are aware, the fact is not contested that on the Jewish Day of Atone-ment in September last innovations were made in the existing practice. Complaints about these innovations were made to an officer of the Palestine Government by the Mutawali of the Waqf in which the pavement is vested, and, when on investigation he found that those complaints were substantiated, he was confronted with a choice between ignoring the Mandatory obligation of his Government to preserve the status quo and the removal of an appurtenance of Jewish worship. Having decided that the Man-datory obligation could not be disregarded, he obtained from the Jewish official present at the Wall an undertaking that the screen which had been introduced in contravention of established practice would be removed before the service on the Day of Atonement. Unfortunately, this undertaking was not fulfilled; and accordingly there was no alternative, bearing in mind the obligation to pre-serve the status quo, to the removal of the screen when, on the following morning, worshippers present at the Wall themselves declined to remove it. Though some of the congregation en-deavoured to prevent it, the removalwas in fact effected without casualties of any but a light nature. The Police who undertook this duty did not include any Jews; at one time it was the practice to post a Jewish police inspector near the Wailing Wall on Jewish Holy Days but, at the urgent request of the Chief Rabbinate, all Jewish police officers had been excused duty on the Day of Atone-
merit. In: future, steps will be taken to ensure that a Jewish officer is present at the Wall on all such occasions. , It has been urged that the Palestine Government should have exercised greater judgment and, in particular, should have con-suited representative Jewish authorities before action was taken. His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that the delicacy of the question of procedure at the Wall and the need for extreme dis-cretion with regard to anything&apos; that might be regarded by watchful neighbours as a breach of the status quo should have been obvious to the responsible Jewish authorities. Those authorities are fully aware that, in the absence of any mutual agreement be-tween themselves and the Moslem authorities regulating the con-duct of services at the Wall, it is open to the Moslem authorities to take exception to any innovations of practice, and it is the duty of the Palestine Government to ensure that there is no infraction of the status quo. If the innovations introduced on the Jewish Day of Atonement were made with the assent of the responsible Jewish authorities, that assent must be assumed to have been given in the full knowledge that, since the permission of the Government and of the Moslem owners of the pavement had not been obtained, the departure from the status quo would have to be stopped by Government if complaint were made. The Jewish authorities&apos;should have been the more alive to the possibility that the Moslem authorities would complain against any departure from the status quo on the Jewish- Day of Atonement, since such a complaint was, in fact, made on the same day in 1925, and, after the police had intervened to restore the status quo, it had been made clear to those concerned that the Palestine Government would regard it as their duty to take similar action in the event of any recurrence.If, on the other hand, the responsible Jewish authorities were not aware of the innovations introduced on the Jewish Day of Atonement, they cannot reasonably expect the Mandatory Adminis-tration to countenance the unauthorised act of a subordinate. In any case, the responsible officer of the Palestine Government was faced with a position calling for an immediate decision and the principles on which he acted cannot, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, be called in question. In the light of subsequent-events, it may be thought unfortunate that the Deputy District Commissioner relied on the undertaking given by the Jewish official present at the Wall that the screen would be removed; but he had-no reason to suppose that that undertaking would not in fact be carried out.It has been represented that the removal&apos;of&apos; the screen should have been postponed until the conclusion of the services and the Fast of the Day of Atonement. It must be pointed out in reply that it is the practice to take immediate action where it is estab-lished that the status quo has been infringed.    In the Church of
the Holy Sepulchre and other Holy Places, even in the.most sacred services. and upon the most holy days, infraction of the status quo has from time immemorial been dealt with immediately and on the spot owing to the risk of creating a precedent which would transform an infraction into an integral portion pf the status quo.The request has been preferred to His Majesty &apos;s Government that they should use their good offices &quot;to promote an arrange-x rnent eliminating the present obstacles to the free exercise of worship &quot; at the Wailing Wall. His Majesty&apos;s Government re-gard it as their duty, and it is their intention, to maintain the established Jewish right of access to the pavement in front of the Wall for the purposes of their devotions and also their right to bring to the Wall those appurtenances that they were allowed to take to the Wall under the Turkish regime. It would be incon-sistent with then duty under the Mandate were they to endeavour to compel the Moslem owners of the. pavement to accord any further privileges or rights to the Jewish community. The possi-bility that such privileges or rights might be acquired by the Jews by mutual arrangement with the Moslem authorities has been lessened by the fact that public opinion in Palestine has definitely removed the&apos;matter from the purely religious orbit and has made of it a political and racial question. Even if the dispute had not assumed this complexion, it would have been difficult to find a solution satisfactory to all parties concerned. In the present state of feeling, the difficulty has been greatly enhanced. Neverthe-less, in the hope that more sober counsels will eventually prevail the Palestine Government have suggested both to the Palestine Zionist Executive and to the Supreme Moslem Council that it would be a convenience to all the parties concerned if a protocol could be mutually agreed upon between the Moslem and Jewish authorities regulating the conduct of the services at the Wall with-out prejudice to the legal rights of the Moslem owners and in such a way as to satisfy normal liturgical requirements and decencies in matters of public worship. The Government have also in-structed a senior officer to sound both parties in a tentative manner, in order to ascertain if some such arrangement can be achieved. If satisfactory assurances are received on this point, the Palestine Government will be most ready and anxious to use their good offices to facilitate such an arrangement. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, for their part, would cordially welcome any arrangement which, while enabling them to fulfil then Mandatory obligation to preserve all existing rights in connection with the Wailing Wall, would provide a solution of the question satisfactory to both parties concerned, and prevent the recurrence of such unfortunate inci-dents as occurred in September last.Colonial Office,19th November,. 1928.(5536)  Wt. 14466-730 500  10/29 P.

APPENDIX III.Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.Dated 15th October, 1929.(Received Colonial Office, 6-40 p.m. 15th October, 1929.)No. 252.   I have received the following telegrams :  (1.) From Arab Executive.   Begins: The Arab Executive Committee in full session, representing all Arab population, deprecate instruction which your Excellency enforced in Buraq. The Committee believe that in enforcing those instructions your Excellency has exceeded your jurisdiction, transgressed upon Arab religious rights and contradicted principle laid down by your Government in White Paper, under pretext of maintenance of public order. This trespass and prejudice will no doubt excite all Arabs. We assure your Excellency&apos; that Arab Moslems as well as Christians are unable to find satisfaction in such proceedings.   Ends.(2.) From Moslem Christian Association of Jaffa.   Begins: The provisional arrangements allowed to Jews in Buraq are deliberate trespass on Moslem rights and Holy Places and contradictory to your Excellency&apos;s announce-ment regarding enforcement of White Paper. The Buraq is the sole property of Moslems, and they themselves possess right of withdrawing permission given to Jews to visit this place. Moslems are prepared to protect this Holy Place with all their power. We protest against such arrangements and ask that they be cancelled, and hold the Government responsible for all consequences of its arbitrary action. Ends.I have also received a letter from Chief Rabbis for Palestine protesting against the Wailing Wall Regulations in which they state :  &apos;&apos; We deem it our duty to express to your Excellency our strong protests and deep indignation at this violation of our religious sentiments, and to declare most insistently that we do not thereby accept this order, as all other orders and new arrangements in connection with services at the Wall, as a normal state of affairs, and that we shall by no means henceforward agree to it. The Chief Rabbinate of Palestine Jews, the Jewish Yishuv, and people of Israel as a whole, will never reconcile themselves to this assault on their religious sentiments and traditions.&quot;These communications point to the urgent need for the appointment of an authoritative body to study, define and determine rights and claims of Moslems and Jews at the Wailing Wall.Until a statement can be made of the early appointment of such a body, tranquillity cannot be restored in Palestine.If it is unlikely that a Commission under Article XIV of the Mandate can be appointed, I urge that you will consider some alternative, in order to terminate a position which cannot be allowed to continue much longer.
APPENDIX IV.Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Dated 19th October, 1929. .(Received Colonial Office 4-36 p.m. 19th October, 1929.)No. 264, Urgent.In opinion of competent observers situation in Palestine is, for the first Lime since outbreaks were suppressed, definitely dangerous. The Moslem population appear to be approaching a state of desperation on account of Government^ failure to meet their wishes in any way. This feeling is not confined to the leaders only, but has spread to the lower classes and to the rural population.It requires only the smallest incident to provoke an outbreak on the part of the Arab population and, if such an outbreak should occur, it will probably not be confined to Palestine itself, but will spread to neighbouring &quot;countries. I have just been informed by French Consul-General that there were disturbances in connection with Wailing Wall regulations in Beirut and Damascus yesterday.One of the chief factors enabling the ill-disposed to keep public opinion inflamed and causing perturbation among the ignorant Arab masses is delay in settling the Wailing Wall question.A statement such as I have asked for in my telegram No. 252 of 15th October should not, I consider, be deferred for more than a week. I should also like to be in a position to inform Arab leaders that I have resumed discussions with you regarding constitutional changes, the suspension of which I announced in my proclamation of 1st September.o
