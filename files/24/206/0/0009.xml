This memo-randum has been drav.ii up largely on the basis of the 1924 treaties, but I draw the.attention of my colleagues to the fact that in the matter of debts I have indicated the possibility of the setting up of a special Committee to deal with the subject as a whole.

of the Treasury or Board of Trade as such but representatives of either Department could &quot;be added if the Ministers concerned think that course expedient,Subject to the approval of my colleagues I propose to corammicaie to Mi Dovgalevsky proposals &quot;based on this memorandum.A.H.September 24th; 1929*

The sequence of events he contemplated was that the British Government should decide   on the resumption of relations and that, after the   necessary Parliamentary approval had been obtained, outstanding questions could then be discussed by the appointed Ambassadors according to the procedure to be settled as a result of the present conversation.In reply to an enquiry from the Secretary of State Monsieur Dovgaievsky said that at. first sight he saw no objection to the list of subjects handed to him.   He was, of course, not familiar with the various questions involved, but if the procedure he had indicated was followed, he felt that there would probably be no objection to the list.The Secretary of State then reminded Monsieur Dovgalevsl of the position of His Majesty1 s Government in this matter as explained to him during the previous negotiations at the end of July, and Monsieur Dovgalevsky replied that he thought there was no misunderstanding, bub laid stress on the fact thattiie procedure to be decided upon had reference to both the resumption of relations and to the questions fordiscussion,/

discussion.   In reply to a further enquiry from the Secretary of State as to what exactly he had in mind, Monsieur Dovgalevsky explained that, as the agreement of Parliament was necessary, any negotiations now undertaken would he of a purely preliminary character, and that in his opinion the best course would be that diplomatic relations should be resumed and Ambassadors, appointed in the first place.   After that had been done the points at issue between the two Governments could then be dealt with according to any procedure which might.now be settled.   There were also a number of practical questions which would arise, such as the place where negotiations should take place, the appoint-ment of delegates, etc.The Secretary of State pointed out that his pro-posal was that he aad Monsieur Dovgalevsky should agree on suitable methods for dealing with the subjects enumerated on his list and with any other subjects which the Soviet Government on their side might wish to add to that list.   If they succeeded in reaching an agreement as to the procedure for dealing with these matters,, their proposals-would then be. submitted to the two Governments for their approval,.On Monsieur Dovgalevsky enquiring what would happen if. the two Goveinments did not approve the agreement reached, Mr, Henderson suggested that further meetings should take place and that a settlement as to procedure could be reached before the meeting of Parliament,.If so, when Parliamentary approval had been obtain-ed, the ordinary diplomatic machinery could be re-instituted, and the agreed procedure for dealing with  . outstanding questions could at once be brought into force.Monsieur/
Monsieur Dovgalevsky then enquired as to the present position of His Majestys s Government.   Was he to understand -that His Majesty&apos;s Government had definitely decided, as-soon as Parliamentary approval could be obtained, to re-establish diplomatic relations and to exchange Ambassadors? Was it in fact their decision to resume diplomatic rela-tions as soon as an agreement on procedure had been reached and Parliamentary approval obtained?The Secretary of State again explained that the position of His Majestyfs Government was as stated to Monsieur Dovgalevsky at the previous meeting.   If an agree-ment could be reached on procedure His Majesty&apos;s Government hoped to bring that procedure into operation after Parlia-ment met and to proceed to the exchange of Ambassadors*Monsieur Dovgalevsky expressed his agreement with the course of action indicated.   He&quot;asked that further dis-discussion should be postponed for two days in order to enable him to examine the list of subjects handed to him.   He enquired whether it was proposed to make suggestions on the procedure for dealing with each subject on that list. The Secretary of State replied in the affirmative, and said that the 1924 Treaty would afford a valuable precedent for dealing with some at any rate of the subjects to be dealt with.   He offered to hand Monsieur Dovgalevsky, at a subsequent meeting, a memorandum of his proposals for deal-ing with the questions enumerated.Monsieur Dovgalevsky then returned to hie previous suggestions and expressed the opinion that a number of the subjects included in the list might preferably be dealt with by the Ambassadors of the two countries when appointedConsiderable/
Considerable discussion then took place, during which the Secretary of State referred to Monsieur Litvinoff&apos;s reply to his recent invitation, in which he &quot; expressed the Soviet Government&apos;s readiness to discuss methods of procedure, and explained that the kind&apos;of proposals he had in mind dealt simply with methods of procedure and not with the merits of the questions. Monsieur Dovgalevsky laid stress on the difficulty of deciding details at this stage.   Ke argued that the question now to be settled was how negotiations were to be carried out, whether by Ambassadors, Commissions, Conferences, etc., and expressed the opinion that it would be better to leave all details for settlement later.    The Secretary of State pointed out the .great advantage of carrying matters as far as possible at the present stage0   He asked Monsieur Dovgaieysky to ccn-sider the programme given to him and then, if the pro-gramme could be agreed upon, to consider the procedure for dealing with the various items upon it.    If the present negotiations resulted in an agreement on the programme and on the procedure it would then be possible, so soon as parliamentary approval could be obtained, to bring the whole system into operation.Monsieur Dovgalevsky then returned to the point he had already made as to the difficulty of deciding the details of procedure at this stage, and asked whether, even if the list were agreed upon and the procedure for dealing with the various questions settled, much pro-gress would have been made, as he had no authority todeal....
deal with any of these questions on their merits.     The Secretary of State again referred to the terms of his invitation, and pointed out that all he asked was that, in accordance with Monsieur Litvinoff&apos;s acceptance, a start should be made with settling the procedure for dealing with Outstanding questions.     He pointed out that it was perfectly possible, for example, to settle whether the question of debts should be dealt with by a Commission or by some other way.    The governments and publics of both countries expected some arrangement to be made on the question of procedure and further delays were merely provocative of rumour and made the situation more difficult.Monsieur Dovgalevsky then agreed to proceed with the negotiations on. the lines suggested by the Secretary of State and asked whether he could at once be given some indication of the procedure which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment proposed for dealing with at any rate some of the questions enumerated on the list,The Secretary of State said that he would prefer not to make definite proposals at the moment but that he would be prepared tomorrow to hand Monsieur Dovgalevsky a memoran dum showing the procedure he suggested.     After further dis cussion it was agreed that a further meeting should take place on Wednesday September 25th at 4 p.m0A.H.24th September,1929.
