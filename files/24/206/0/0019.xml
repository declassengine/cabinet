THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GO VTiiRNMENT-Copy Ho.    ,% secret.CABINET.CP.269(29) .BIRTH CONTROL. Mgaerandiam &quot;by the Minister of Health.1.       I desire to consult my colleagues as to the policy which should he adopted &quot;by the Ministry of Health on the subject of birth control.     My Department are directly concerned with this matter only In so far as it affects the Maternity and Child Welfare Centres and Ante-Natal Centres supported &quot;by public funds, and the question which arises is whether Information as to methods of birth control can. properly be given at those Centres.So      The policy which has been adopted by my predecessors (of all parties) is embodied in the following paragraphs(i)   The Maternity and Child Welfare Centre should deal only with the expectant andjaursing mother (and infant) and not with the married or unmarried woman contemplating the application of contraceptive methods, (ii)    It is not the function of an Ante-Natal Centre orMaternity and Child Welfare Centre to give advice in regard to birth control, and exceptional oases in which the avoidance of pregnancy seems desirable on medical grounds should be referred by the Medical Officer of the Centre for particular advice to a private practitioner or hospital. 3.       The reasons for the adoption of this policy were, firstly, that as these Centres are maintained out of rates and taxes, persona of all opinions on the subject of birth control are required by law to contribute towards the cost, and they should not be used for so controversial a purpose without express directions from Parliament;    secondly,  that the use of
the Centres for the dissemination of information on hirth control would offend the susceptibilities,  if not the consciences,  of many of the official and voluntary workers who support the Centres and of many of the mothers who use them,  with the result that the valuable work which the Centres are doing would be damaged and the numbers of mothers who attend the Centres would be reduced;    and thirdly, that the Centres are not suitably staffed or equipped for the purpose of applying contraceptives or teaching women how to apply them.4.       So far as expectant mothers are concerned,  the Centres were established for the purpose of educating and advising as to the hygiene of pregnancy, of ascertaining the condition and probable course of the pregnancy and, wherever necessary,  of referring the woman to the appropriate doctor or hospital for treatment of particular conditions.     For nursing mothers the function of the Centres is similarly to give post-natal advice on conditions arising out of the confinement and to inform the mothers where any necessary treatment for such conditions can best be obtained.     In the exceptional casas in which the doctor at the Centre   considers that the avoidance of further pregnancies is desirable on medical grounds,  he can advise the mother to that effect and refer her to a private practitioner, hospital or speoial clinic for treatment.     The principle permeating the organisation is that it is set up to educate and advise and not give actual treatment.      Treatment is a matter for the hospital or the private medical practitioner as the case may be and it has always to be remembered that any attempt to develop treatment at the centres would rais&apos;e a difficult
controversial question with the medical profession as impinging on the sphere of private practice *     It would also ihvolve Considerable increase of staff,  to say nothing of somewhat fundamental modifications in the system of organisation.The advocates of using the Centres for the purposeof birth control contend, that, while the well-to-do woman can obtain proper instruction in methods of birth control,  the poorer woman cannot afford to pay a doctor fbr this instruction and is forced to seek it from quackd or other undesirable sources.     They argue,  therefore,  that in order to place1 -the two classes on an equality,  the women who usually attend the Centres should be able to obtain proper instruction there.6.       I consider that the answer to these contentions is contained in paragraph 3 above.     It is clearly for Parliament to decide whether facilities for instruction in birth control methods and for applying contraceptives should be provided at the public expense;    and in coming to a decision the ethioal and economic aspects of the question would have to be considered, as well as its bearing on the public health.   But even if the decision were in the affirmative,  it would,  in my opinion, be essential that the facilities should be provided elsewhere than at Maternity and Child Welfare Centres.    It is practically certain that serious damage would be done to the work of these Centres if they were used for a purpose which Is the subject of acute controversy.7.       I may remind my colleagues that this question was raised twice in the late Parliament.     In February, 1926, Mr. Thurtle sought leave to introduce a Bill into the House of Commons authorising Local Authorities to incur expenditure in conveying knowledge of birth control methods to married women who desire it.      The motion was opposed and on a division was defeated by a majority of 167 to 81.
But in the following April the House of Lords, on the motion of Lord Buckmaeter, passed a resolution to the effect that &quot;His Majesty1s Government be requested to withdraw all&quot;Instructions given to, or conditions imposed on, Welfare Committees for the purpose of causing such Committees to withhold from married   women in their districts information when sought by such women as to the best means of limiting their families&quot;.     This resolution was carried against the advice of the late Government, and in view of the previous deoision of the Commons on Mr. Thurtle&apos;s Bill no action was taken on the resolution.8.       I find that in 1925 my predecessor had occasion to consider the principles on which the Maternity and Child Welfare Centres at present act, as stated in paragraph 2 above, and saw two non-Party deputations of Members of Parliament, one advocating views similar to those of&quot; Lord Buckmaster and the other maintaining that even the present practice at the Centres goes if anything too far. As the views of the two deputations cancelled out, Mr. Chamberlain decided to leave matters as they stood.   The question is, of ooxirse,  in no sense a Party one, and opinion on the subject is sharply divided in all three Parties,9.       I propose,  therefore, to follow the policy adopted by my predecessors on this subject, but it is possible that the advocates of &quot;birth control&quot; will endeavour to get the matter raised in the new Parliament.    If the Government have to express a view on the subject, it will,  of course, be necessary to have regard to the ethical and economic aspects of the question, but I should feel bound to press my conviction that to use the Centres for this purpose would be
1Ihighly prejudicial to their work, and that such a purpose is outside their proper scope.     At the same time,  I should propose to&apos; point out that as the object of the Centres is to promote the health of the mothers and children who attend them,   there would not be the same objection to allowing the Medical Officers of the Centres to give advice as to contraceptive Jiiethods to married women attending the Centres&quot; in those cases in which the Medical Officers are of opinion that the avoidance of further pregnancies is desirable On medical grounds..    I am advised that such cases are exceptional and would be cases in which the Medical Officers considered that further pregnancies would endanger the life of the mother.     I am informed that this is,   in fact, the practice now in the rare cases which occur.    But I should disapprove systematic instruction in birth control at these Centres, and I should hope that the House of Commons would take the same view.     If, however, any proposal were made that the Medical Officers of the Centres should be allowed to give advice and information as to contraceptive methods to married women who attend the Centres,  in those cases in which the Medical Officers consider that the avoidance of further pregnancies is desirable on medical grounds.,  I suggest that this question should be left to a free vote of the House.(Intld).
