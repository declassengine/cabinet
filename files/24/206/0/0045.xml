DOOTIktEMT, IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAHITI C MAJESTY&apos;S GOvlSRKMEITT..297 (29).Copy Ho,CAB I NET S 1* U M     CLEARANCE.MEbiOEAMDXIM&quot; by the SECRETARY of STATE for SCOTLAND.1,   While progress in dealing with slum areas in Scotland is u as satisfactory as oould be desired, the local Authorities appear the whole to have done more in this direction than in England, is may in some measure he due to the faot that in Scotland the esent 50% grant is available not only towards the coat of rovement Schemes but also towards tho cost of providing new uses to replace those closed by means of Closing Orders.Aaaafiaftat &amp;      ordure.2.   The Local Authorities operating the present procedure by ana of Improvement Schemes have expressed the view that it cannot materially amended or expedited and that the rate at which the urns can be oleared depends largely on the rate at which the new uses can be built.     It would appear that Schemes oan be put rough more speedily than houses can be built, and that the Looal thorities have not bo far found difficulty in determining the -development of a oloared area.      It is desired however that ovioiou bo made to ovoroome the effect of the Derby decision and to ovids that no owner will receive less than site value for hie operty.3.    I agree however that if at all possible the proceduro ould bo simplified and I have no objeotions to the proposed endments suggested in the Memorandum by the Minister of Health, P. 296 (29), subject to the following observations.4.    As regards the proposal t make a compulsory purchase order, pedition will result here, in that 3imila:;- to that obtaining at pres 11 require to be advertised, Hotio neico.,-ed. a local -enquiry held by r,he oomponiation on a site opor;-iea oould only be determined opertles in order to determine in Inhabitable) they should be placedo give Looal Authorities power I am not clear that any greater presumably the procedure will ent under a &quot;Scheme&quot;.

Tho same type of objections would it seems to me inuch in evidence undor the &quot;Order&quot; proposal.6.    Aa regards the alternative procedure suggested, grant is noted above, at present paid in Scotland whore Local Authoritiesrehouse/
rehouse persons consequent on the issue of eloaing orders. I should desire this principle continued aa it has proved most useful in enabling Looal Authorities [more especially tho Local Authorities of county areas and the smaller burghs) to deal with individual houses or small groups of houses in oases where an Improvement Scheme was not suitable or necessary.7.   Presumably tho proposal under whioh Local Authorities would require owners in an aroa to demolish houses would apply only to uninhabitable houses, but this proposal would not oover the case of a tenement of houses which is fairly common in Scotland where jjpjafc of *ne housse in the tenement may be habitable and others not.     The demolition of the tenement in suoh oases is not practicable unless the Looal Authority become by purchase the owners of the habitable houses.     Such cases would require to be provided for,gzlnaiBlfl off unjt Grant,.8,   The Looal Authorities in Scotland have not taken serious exception to the Departmental control necessitated by the 50% grant method.     Indeed in many cases they are anxious to obtain the Department&apos; o assistance in the elaboration of theiy proposals.     I have no objection however to abandoning the detailed control as is proposed in England under tha unit basis of grant, provided a satisfactory unit is fixed to suit the circumstances of Scotland.Q.    If It is proposed to fix a single unit applicable to the whole oountry, I doubt if this would be fair.     As explained above, Local Authorities in Scotland deal with the&apos;problem at present In two ways - la) by Improvement Schemes which include not only the erection of new houses but the acquisition and olearanoe of the property on the slum site;   and (b) by the system of closing orders under whioh the Local Authority do not acquire the old property and site but build the now houses elsewhere.     The expenditure under la) is necessarily greater and     oonsequenoe the Looal Authority that prooeeded under [a) would be prejudiced by a uniform grant as against the one who could meet the situation by proceeding under (b).     Provision would I think have to be made for a larger grant unit in the one case than in the other.     Procedure similar to that under la) may be neoasoary to soouro oloarance of congested areas in the large towns but in smaller districts tho end aimed at oan be achieved under (b).Need for increased &amp;rant.10.    The proposals in thr Memorandum of the Minister of Health, C.P. 296 129), appear to contemplate Exchequer assistance on a more generous scale than at present, in order to stimulate Local Authorities to greater activity in dealing with the slum problem.     As to this Scottish Local Authorities have expressed the view that they will be financially unable to proceed much further with slum olearance schemes unless the present 50$ grant is materially incrsased, the average deficit falling on the rates at present being about  8.l0s.0d, per house as compared with the  4.10s.0d. which they have to pay under.the TOieatley Act.     The grant which they are asking for the future is a 75% grant.Amount of Pent -payable by Slum Dweller.11.    I note that in England it Is estimated that about 50$ of the inhabitants of slums may be able to pay the rent of a ^Nheatley Act house loay 10/- to 10/6 a week inclusive of rates) and that tho remainder may be able to pay 7/6 per week Iinclusive of rates).     Information before me shews that only a comparatively small proportion of the occupants of Scottish slums could pay the wheat ley rents.
12. It has to bo borne in mind that in contrast to England where the proportion of one and two apartment houses is small, over half the houses in Scotland are of one and two rooms and these types of houses preponderate in the congested areas of the large towns.     The rents paid for these old houoea vary in different plaoes.     Information obtained in connection with Improvement Schemes shews that the average rent (inclusive of rates) paid by tenants of old houses may vary from an average of 1/6 in one area to 3/5 in another for a one apartment house; from 2/- to 5/4 for a two apartment house;   and from 2/6% to 1/1 for a 3 apartment house.mat the Scottish Slum Dweller oan Pay.13.   It appears to me that even a rent of 7/6 per week (i.e.  I9.10a.0d. per annum inolueive of rates) iB more than most of the Scottish slum dwellers can afford and that they are still less able to afford the rent of a Wheatley house.     In my view a rent of about 6/- per week (inclusive of rates) is as much ae oan be expeoted from the majority,      Sven this rent is materially higher than the rents paid for the old houses -especially for the single apartment houses, the tenants of whioh, when moved have to pay for a two apartment house.     Tho great demand from Scottish Looal Authorities at the moment is for two apartment houses but it is clear that this demand is based not so much on the accommodation required by the families who are to occupy the houses as on the rent which they oan afford to pay. The rent of a two apartment houoe under the Slum Cloaranco Rehousing Scheme is generally about  12 per annum (exoluaivo of rates) or  15 (inclusive of rates) i.e. about 6/- per week as compared with the 7/6 per week suggested for England.Sojmimitmt.14,    In my view therefore a larger grant must be available for Scotland if wc are to provide houses that the poorer persons can afford to oooupy.     If the Unit Grant were fixed for Scotland so that in effect the Looal Authorities&apos; share- of the lose would be the equivalent of the sum whioh the wheatley Act contemplated they would bear, via.,  4.10s,Od, , there would bo every incentive to the Local Authorities to proceed actively with slum clearance.     The neoeesity for a larger grant in Scotland per unit ariseo partly from the fact that building coats are generally dearer in Scotland, owing principally to the different methods of construction followed for olimatic reasons;   that the special oirouraatances obtaining in Scotland have been recognised by the continuance by successive Governments of the Wheat ley Act subsidy for a longer period: that the ratio of increase in rent that would fall to be paid by the slum tenant for his new house would from the figures given by the Minister of Health and in this Memorandum, be greater in Scotland than in England;   and that in recent years there has been a greater ratio of unemployment in Scotland.15,   For the reaeons given, I consider that the Unit of Grant should be greater in Scotland than in England and that in any negotiations with Scottish Looal Authorities I should be authorised to deal with them on the understanding that I would make the best possible bargain with them but would not be limited to the amount that may be determined for England,     Ae already indicated I consider that it may be necessary to have two Units for the reasons given in paragraph 9 above.     It maybe/
9 K 9be that the negotiations would indioate that it might he necessary to adopt as an alternative a grant per house as in the Acts of 1923 and 1924 rather than a Unit Grant on the basis of the number of persons dispossessed.16.   As an indioation of the additional cost to the Exchequer of an increased grant, I mi$vt point out that during 1926, 1927 and 1928, the number of houses oompleted under Slum Clearance Schemes in Sootland averaged a little over 2,000 per annum.     If as the result of an increased grant equivalent to what the Local Authorities desire, viz., 75/  of the loss instead of 50$, this number could be inoreased to 5,000 houses per annum, the increased annual Exchequer Contribution for Sootland would be roughly about  21, WO on a total housing vote for Scotland of over  1,500,000,TO,    ADAMSCN.th November, 1929.
