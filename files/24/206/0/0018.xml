British Goal IndustryfDistrict and Inter-District Schemes for the regulation of coal output and prices..1.      On the 13th July the President of the Board of Trade circulated to the Goal Sub-Commit tee of the Cabinet as a basis&apos; for their discussion a memorandum by&apos; the Secretary for Mines on suggested Government policy in relation to the British coal industry (B.C.I.   (29) 2).      Attached to this memorandum  as an Appendix was an outline of a &quot;compulsory&quot; marketing scheme. 2.      On the. 23rd July the president  made a statement on Government policy In the House of Commons *      In the course of this statement the President said:&quot;-&quot;The representative coalowners who were met yesterday were  informed that the  Government desired the owners to develop the organisation *f district marketing arrangements and a central scheme for co-ordinating the activifeie-s of the district organisatIons *In the legislation to be introduced in the autumn, the Government will take powers to enable them &quot;if necessary,,  to compel colliery owners to conform to the rules of a district organisation inaugurated with the approval of owners of oollieries producing the majority of the output Qf the district,      The Government will also take Sjpwer        enable  them t,o initiate a scheme in any district which fails to constitute an organisation having the approval of the major it 7/,  and will take similar power to set up a central co-ordinating authority,  if one is not constituted voluntarily.The owners have alsf- been invited to remain In constant consultation with the Government as to the terms of the legislation..&quot;In reply t^ a supplementary question asking whether a rise  intho price of coal to the consumer was involved,  the president said, that this was an important point which must be consideredby the parties and will not be overlooked.3.      This statement of Government policy was circulated by the Mines Department to all colliery ovners,  and It was made clear to them that they were required, after such consultation
as may be necessary-cr-desirable with the Government Departments concerned, to submit their final, proposals fcr the organisation cf district marketing arrangements and for a central scheme for co-^r-Unating the activities of the district organisations by the middle of October, 1929, in order &quot;that these organisations may be functioning on the 1st January, 193004,     The Department has&quot; been in close touch with representatives &amp;f the ccal  industry during the last two msnthsr      Fair progress has been made in the, drafting of schemes in most districts &apos;and in the preparation of an inter-district scheme for the country as a whole.      There is a reasonable prospect that proposals for all the districts and for the country as a whole will be ready for submission to the Government by the middle of October.5.      These schemes,  so far as their contents are known at this date,  contain many features in .,common,  and the purpose pf this memorandum is to examine these and tc submit points for decision.Provision is made in most if not in all the District Schemes for r.(a) Regulation of output.(b) Regulation of price.(c) Financial assistance to the export trade,(d) Collection of a levy^&amp;utput.(e) Machinery for reference of matters ind i s pu t e - -t-o-a-rb itration,60     ,Regu.la t Ion of ; Out put .      This is the foundation of all the schemes and afS^cts employment,  costs and the selling price of coal.      There are  two -stages - the determination of a
basic tonnage for each member of the district association and the application periodically to that basic tonnage of a quota  (or fercentage).      It is Important that  the basic tonnage should be fixed in close relation to the actual output capacity in a recent period, that due allowance should be made for pits and seams ^hich are developing, and that the balance should be held fairly between up-to-date and progressive undertakings and those which are old-^r and less efficient.It is equally Important that there should be plenty of elasticity in the output regulation arrangements.      This can be secured by fixing the quota or percentage at monthly or quarterly intervals In advance of production rith pc-^er to revise it at 24-hours T  notice,.      Every effort must be made to avoid criticism of the operation of a scheme on the grounds that men are unemployed, that consumers are crying out for ccal and that none is to be had owing to restriction of output. It Is  impracticable to  forecast thfi demand for coal with exactitude even for so short a period as a month and the scheme must therefore be so devised that output quota can be adapted, at short notice to meet a suddeu increased demand for coal.Most of the district schemes will, it is thought, also provide for the transfer or purchase &apos;of basic tonnages, and this may result in the closing dorn of Inefficient pits earlier than would otherwise happen.
fBefore leaving outwut re gala t ions, mention should be made of the provision in all schemes of penalties for the pro-auction of coal in excess of the permittee output.      There is usually a monetary penalty  (about 2s.6d. per ton) and in some cases in addition a provision for deducting the excess quantity from, the member s allocation in a succeeding period and distributing it amongst the other members,Adequate machinery for appeal to an impartial tribunal by a member who is dissatisfied with his basic tonnage is essential in a -scheme of output regulation on tho lines described.Regulation ox price.     Very little information is yet available as to tho methods to be adopted in the various Districts for controlling prices.      In South Wales it is under-stood that a complete classification of coals&apos;and a schedule of minimum prices in each class or grace have been drawn up. In all Districts provision for minimum or agreed prices is under consideration although there may in some instances be an inclination to rely entirely upon a careful regulation of output to bring about an improvement in price.It is possible that the issue of schedules of minimum price may make it difficult for the coal  owners to obtain anything more.      There is a tendency for the minimum to become the maximum and this tendency will have to   be kept in mind in-drawing up the minimum price schedules.A certain amount of public attention has already been directed to the effect of the operation of district and inter-district arrangements upon prices.     A. substantial body ofopunion urges that cheap coal is a vital necessity - a section-of the Scottish press is now vigorously discussing this.in
relation to Government policy.     Another school ofi thought holds that everything is fair &quot;between buyer and seller and that if tho coal industry can secure a better price for its product it is fully entitled to use every means to that end, but the Government is in the position of referee and must remain impartial and help neither side.      As against all this.it can be argued with great force that the coal industry is entitled to obtain a fair price for the coal it produces, that other industries and public utility mid ortakings cannot expect indefinitely to be subsidised by the coal industry with coal sold at below cost  of production.      There is no doubt that there will bo much debate in the House of Commons on this aspect of the problem of tho reorganisation of the coal industry when the necessary legislation is introduced.    Ob-jection will be taken, for instance, to any proposal which involves an increase in the  ^a and electric light bill of the domestic consumer.There is a further consideration Yfhich should not be overlooked.    It will be very difficult for the Go&quot;? ernment tc avoid entirely some responsibility for wages if they take power to approve schemes which provide for the fixation of prices.      proceeds dopend very largely upon p.r.inas..and wages are 85 por cent,  of proceeds.The probability is that regulation of price will be an essential part of most District schemes.      If it is accepted for any District it ought perhaps to be made to apply to all Districts.      Otherwise,  one might  fund in spite of output regulation,  that,  for example,  South TTales with schedules of minimum prices is being undersold in contested markets abroad by competing collieries  on the Eorth East coast.
8.     Financial assistance from the inland to the export trade. 110 Both this question and that of the regulation of price are tied up to some extent with the  question of hours of work. If hours are to be reduced without a reduction of wages, it is essential that, excluding such consumers as the heavy ihdustriea selected inland consumers should pay a higher price,  sufficient to meet the extra costs of reduced hours in producing not only the coal which the,,; themselves consume &quot;but also all th--  other coal, including particularly export coal, for which a higher price cannot be extracted.    This proposal will of course meet with strenuous opposition from manufacturers is ho so products are sold overseas.      The;/ will complain that not only are their foreign competitors enabled to buy British coal more cheaply than they, but also that the home manufacturers are being required to find the money which is being us-d to subsidise the provision of cheap coal for their competitors. &quot;   mjb a matter of fact the market for British coal amongst these foreign competitors is small and it can fairly be argued  that if we lost our Foreign trade in coal the increase in the cost of production would adversely affect the inland price more than it will be affected by a levy.Apart from the need   for helping the export trade to meet the cost of a reduction of hours, there is of course a case for assisting exporting pits to recapture contested markets from Germany and Poland by means of cheap coal.    This is being done at present unuor the &quot;Five Counties   (C.C.C.A. ) scheme.      There is also   the point to be borne in mind that if the&apos;inland trade is not prepared Co help the export trade to retain its foreign markets, exporting pits will compete for the inland trade.        It is therefore to some extent a ma tter of self-interest for the latter.      A point of some difficulty may arise in connection with the subsidy to export coal.        The South Walea and Korth-Sast Coast pits and to a less extent Scotland,  are largely  in
1JL 9the export trade j it would bo an impossible burden on the inland pits in South wales,  for example,  to help their export pits to the same amount per ton that the District covered by the C.C.C.a., with its huge inland trade can help its small export trade-from the Lumber,      It is submitted for decision that if the principle of financial assistance from the pits producing for inland to those producing for export is regarded as an essential feature of the  district schemes,  it must be controlled &quot;by the Inter-District organisation so that ail home production pays the same contribution and all export trade receives the same benefit.      It would of course be desirable to differentiate between foreign markets in alloca-ting the funds available for subsidising exports, although this policy is not followed by the CC.C.A.       Under their existing scheme every ton of expert coal wherever it is going receives a flat rate subsidy,Collection of a levy on output,   a    trifling charge per ton, almost negligible in amount, will in all cases be required for the administrative expenses of the district and Inter-District Schemes.      In audition a levy will be required from all Districts to form a central pool of money from which financial assistance can be given to the export trade.The only other purpose for which a levy might be required would be for providing compensation for pits closing down. A scheme of that  kind was in operation in Scotland for the twelve months ending Karch last, but it is unlikely that it will be revived.0i    Machinery for reference of matters in uispute to arbitration.Representations have t- en made to the Department by a number of coal owners with regard to the appeal machinery.    *. right of appeal is essential on sev ral matters of vital interest to
individual colliery owners, e.g. allocation ana     vision of basic&quot;tonnage,  classification of coals,  fixation of minimum prices.      Arbitration machinery has been provided in the  Inter-District scheme ana it is probable  that similar machinery will be found in the District schemes when the Department receives them.      Bet some  coal owners appear to be very nervous about the character of the appeal or arbitration arrangements and are pressing the Mines Department to I ecome a final court of appeal.      This would, it is submitted, be most undesirable.      The case would be adequately met if the Government agree to appoint, or if not to appoint, at any rate to provide the machinery for the selection of independent arbitrators.    The Government have already decided that 100 per cent, membership of district and inter-district schemes^, is in the national interest and on that minorities have no appeal.    They are, however, entitled to claim that their inclusion in the marketing arrangements should be on terms which are fair and equitable tc all parties and that if they are  dissatisfied ,vith the terms there is a right of appeal to an impartial tribunal appointed or approved by the Government.      Some provision of this kind will, it is thought, assist the progress cf the necessary legislation through Parliament, Representation of consumers and workpeople.      There is no provision for this at present in any of the District schemes er in the Inter-District scheme.
1 91X fvThe Government will undoubtedly be -pressed to see that effective representation of both consumers and workmen is included in the schemes, both district and inter-district, and on merits there is a great deal to be said for it. The interest of the consumer&apos;s representative will be to keep the price down and to keep the quota up.      The interest of the workmen&apos;s representative on the.other hand will be to keep the price - and therefore proceeds and wages -up;    but he will also be concerned to secure employment for as many men as possible, which would mean a large, quota.There will be great difficulty in securing voluntary agreement by the coal owners to the representation of these interests,particularly on .the District Committees.It is for consideration whether the Government will insist upon such representation (a)  on the district committees,   (b)  on the Inter-district committee,  or (c) on both.The Government may wish to consider the size and number of the Districts operating separate schemes.,The Districts proposed by the coal owners, with their output and    exports of coal in 19.2 8,  are as follows  :--9-

4 0. ^X il t&apos;JIt is not l2iow.c .vL other there- will be separate schemesfor the small Districts or whether they are to &quot;be grouped insome way with other Districts.      There are obvious -vdvantagesin limiting the number of District Schemes, but there is agood, deal of criticism of  the huge ,ji*oa covered by the C.G.G.A.Their present disinclination to assist the export trade out-side their own area h:;,s already been dealt with.    if this attitude were maintained it might be necessary to considerbreaking up tho C.C.C.A. into s; number of groups, e.g,fl) Yorkshire,   (2) Notts, and Derby,   (3) Lancashire and Cheshireand  (4.) the remainder.It is understood that Lancashire and Cheshire are at present discussing withdrawal from the C.C.C.A* and tho formation of a separate organisation.    This has at any rate been deferred until the end of the year, as the C.C.C.A. scheme&apos;,which expired at tho end of September, has been renewed for throe months with its present constituents.There is the further question - what is a majority? It would be possible for tho C.-C .C .A. to present a scheme approved by the majority of its members on an output basis, but opposed -by a majority of tho coal owners in one or more of the coalfields comprising the C.G.C.A. group.    Presumably the Government will require a majority at any x*ate for each separatevtaigi-s - wt:certain..(?nt.   district 813*    Int e r-D istrict So he mo.    The fining Association have supplied the Department unofficially with a copy of the,Draft Heads of an Agreement for tho co-ordination of District Schemes.

Arrangements arc also contomplatcd later on with merchants, factors and exporters to eliminate any duplication and &quot;waste&quot; in morchanting and distribution. 14.    Legislation.  It Is proposed that u Bill should be prepared,  of which the following is a rough-outline;fa) reciting that it is expedient in the interests of the coal mining industry that the conditions of pro auction and sale of coal should, be regulated and co-ordinated;(b) putting every colliery under a statutory obligation to comply with the rules and regulations laid down in an approved scheme  of a District Committee;(c) requiring every District  (as defined) similarlyto comply with the rules,  etc,  of an approved Inter-District scheme. (&amp;) defining tho matters on which such rules  (under both (b) and  (c ) ) should bo made,  i.c (1) constitution of District and inter-district committees,  Including provision for represent-ation of workpeople and consumers; (2) definition of areas comprising the Districts; (3) regulation of output;

The prevision of adequate appeal machinery and of representation of consumers and workpeople, plus the fairly detailed statement under  (d) of the matters on which rules and regulations will he made,  should help to remove any objection that may be raised by Members of Parliament that they are being asked to approve legislation before they have seen the Schemes which that legislation will make compulsory.&apos;
15.      The points upon which an immediate decision isrequired are  :-(a) Approval in principle of schemes based upon regulation of output as described in&quot; paragraph 6;(b) Approval in principle of schemes which also involve price regulation as described in paragraph 7;(c) If price regulation is approved,  is it to be insisted upon in all districts?(d) Approval in principle of financial assistance from the inland to the export trade by means of levy and subsidy (paragraphs    8 and 9);(e) Approval for Government selected arbitrators (paragraph 10);(f) Representation of consumers  and workpeople (paragraph 11);(g) Approval of adoption of wages - ascertainment districts as units for district schemes.(h) Approval of outline of proposed Legislation (paragraph 14).
