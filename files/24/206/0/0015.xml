M PROPOSED A1CEIIDMTCNT BILL.C .P.265(/j9l^. ---Memo ran dim hy the Minj. ste r of Health.Referring to Cabinet Minutes of the 25th September (34(29)) and having regax^d to the general feeling of the Cabinet on that occasion, I have thought it advisable to discuss further with the Chancellor of the Exchequer the question of possible extensions of the proposals made in Cabinet Paper CP,232(29) especially in regard tc pre-act widows.As the result of this discussion I propose to make an extension of benefits considerably wider than was contemplated in that memorandum.One of the proposals made in that memorandum was to provide pensions for pre-act widows of men of the insurable class between the ages of 65 and 70 provided such widows were not less than 50 years of age when their husbands died.It wa-s felt I think by the Cabinet that this proposal did not go far enough end I now propose, with the concurrence of the Chancellor, to provide pensions for all pre-act widows of men in the in sur able category who have attained the age of 55 or at the date when they shall attain that age.The number of women whe will be brought into benefit * next year by this proposal is estimated at 295,000, as compared with 60^-65,000 estimated to benefit by the earlier proposal.The rest of the earlier proposals remain unaltered, except that the pre-act widens&apos; petision will continue till the youngest child attains the age of 15 and not 18 - this is readily -defensible as the widow herself will now receive pension at the age of 55 .
The total effect of the proposals is to give approximately half a million pre-act widows of men in the insurable class immediate or contingent right to a pension.A memorandum &quot;by the Government Actuary setting out the financial implications of the new proposals is attached.A copy of the draft bill is also attached, with brief notes on the clauses.Clause l(l) will be replaced by a clause giving effect to the concession above proposed.It is hoped to have this clause drafted in time for submission to the Home Affairs Committee on the 9th October, as also a minor clause just arranged with the service departments reducing the contributions of service men by one halfpenny a week,  to meet a grievance arising out of the provision in the original Act that widows pensions were not payable under the Act to persons in receipt of a service dependant&apos;s pension.Otherwise the Mil is drafted on the basis of the proposals in CP.232(29) with the addition of a clause which has been added at the request of the Lord Privy Seal providing for payment of pensions and continuance of insurance in the event of migration to other parts of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions.At the instance of the Chancellor of the Exchequer the Bill will contain provisions fixing the annual charges for the pensions fund on an increasing scale,  sufficient to provide for the new liabilities and to smooth over the heavy increase in the Exchequer contribution which would otherwise require to be made at the end of the first decennial period.I should, I think, add that in view of the very large number of widows who will now be brought under the Scheme it will be quite impossible, as a mere matter of administration, to commence payment of pensions to all beneficiaries on the 1st of January, 1930 - the number of claims
to &quot;be handled, will be between four and five-hundred thousand.I propose, therefore, to follow the precedent set by the late Government and to pay(l) as from 1st January, 1930, pensions to wives aged 65-70of men over 70 on 1st January, 1928, and all other minor classes brought into benefit by the Bill,(over 70,000); (2) as from 1st July, 1930, pensions to the pre-actwidows over the age of 60, (about 20,000); (3) as from the 1st January, 1931, pensions to the pre-actwidows between 55 and 60,  (about 85,000). My colleagues will* I think, readily appreciate how much more advantageous the present proposals are from the political point of view than those previously submitted.   What they do is to provide either immediate or contingent benefits for the whole body of pre-act widows of the insurable class and to get rid at one stroke of the anomalies and difficulties in regard to that class which have been one of our main grounds for the criticism of the Act of 1925.At the same time I ought to make it clear, if indeed it is not already clear, that we have not got rid of all the difficulties.   While we bring in the pre-act widow at 55 without reference to her means, we leave out such classes as the insured spinster of that age of impaired capacity who has to continue for 10 more years to pay contributions before she receives her pension, the widows of non-insured olasses such as the hawker or the small working craftsman, the deserted wife of an Insured man who cannot establish her claim, the insured woman supporting an invalid husband, who again has to wait till 65 for her pension.   We shall also bring into relief the hard case of those post-act widows whose claims fail because (despite the relaxation in this respect proposed by the Bill)
the qualification is&apos; just short of what is prescribed by the Act of 1925.Our answer to such criticisms will be that what we have sefi out to do is to dsal with anomalies within the purview of the Act of 1925 and that other, matters must wait for the wider survey of the social insurance systems which we are under obligation to undertake.Ministry of Heal October 4th,
WIDOWS PEK3I0H3.Statement by the Government Actuary as to the Cost of the Amended Proposals.Pension to wife aged 65-70 of an insured man who was over 70 on 2nd January, 1928.These pensions are to become payable as from the 1st January, 1930.The estimated number of pensions to be awarded is 24,000 and the cost in the first full year (1930-31) is  550,000.The number of cases will rapidly diminish as the age of 70 is reached and the. beneficiaries enter the over 7o pension class.    The oost for the full period to 31st March, 1936, is about  2 millions.Pensions to widow aged 55-70 of a man of the insured Glass who (%) died before 4th January, 1926, or (2) was over 70 years of age on 4th January, 1926.The pensions to widows in this category who are over the age of 60 are to be payable from 1st July, 1930, and to widows between the age of 55 and 60 as from 1st January, 1931,So far as can be ascertained the number of widows on whom rights will be conferred by this proposal is approximately 500,000.   Of these some 210,000 will become entitled to pension on 1st July, 1930 and a further 85,000 on 1st January, 1931.   In the remaining  00,000 cases the pension will become payable as from the date on which the
widow reaches the age of 55.The cost in the period of nine months from 1st July, 1930,  to Slat March, 1931, is about  4,600,000. In 1931-2 the cost will be  7,3oo,000 and during tbs  full perioa from 1st July, 193o, to 31st March, 1936, about  37,600,000.Extension, as from 1st January, 193o, of &quot;Pre-Act&quot; Widows&apos; Pensions till tho youngest child attains age 16.The cost in the first full year, 1930-31, is about  470,000 and in the whole period to 31st March, 1936, about  2,600,000.Removal, as from 1st January, 193o, of Reduction in Children&apos;s Allowances in cases where an Award has been made under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act.The cost is estimated to begin at about  100,000 a year and to rise to a permanent maximum of about  150,000 a year.     Estimated expenditure to 21st March, 1936, about  800,000.Removal, as from 1st January, 193c, of the Test as to Average number of contributions in the case of persons who had been continuously insured for ten years on reaching age&quot;60.It is understood that at the outset nearly 20,000 pensions may become payable to persons, including from one to two thousand widows, whose claims have hitherto been rejected, at a cost of about  500,noo a year.     In view of the probable reactions of the provisions of tho
National Health Insurance Act, 1928 which enable insured persons of advanoed age who have suffered heavy unemployment to retain their insurance qualification, it is thought that the cost of this concession will gradually diminish, and the total up to 31st karch, 1936, is put, somewhat speculatively, at about  2,400,000.F.Heduotion, as from 1st January, 193o, ox contribution payable by men in the forces by one halfpenny per week.The estimated cost of this concession in a full year is about  30,000.    The cost in the period from 1st January, 193o, to 3lst March, 1936, is about  200,000.The following is a summary of the estimated numbers of persons granted pensions, under the new concessions, at the outset and of the oost of the proposals in the full period to 31st Maroh, 1936.Pension to wife aged 65-70 of an insured man over 70 on 2nd January, 1928.Pension to widows aged 55-70 of men of the insured classExtension of &quot;Pre-Act&quot; widows&apos; pensionsRemoval of reduction in children&apos;s allowances in Workmen&apos;s Compensation casesRemoval of Test as to average number of contributions in certain casesReduction^of contribution payable by men in the ForcesEstimated number of new pensions granted at outse t.24,000295,000 18, tmo10,00020 .OOCEstimated cost in period to31st March, 1936.367 .0002,000,00037,600,0002,600,000800,0002,400,000200,0(0 45,600,000
The total of  45,600,000 is only a part of the cost of the new proposals.    The charge in respect of widows aged over 55 will run on for many years and will not fall to less than  3,000,000 a year till about 1946. The^estimated total expenditure under all the headings of the new proposals in the ten years 1936-45 is  49 millions, the aggregate for the first sixteen years thus being nearly  95 millions.The Exchequer Contribution. The present Exchequer contribution is  4 millions a year to the 31st March, 1936, and under the scheme as it now stands  (Act of 1925) it is estimated that an equated Exchequer charge for the ten years beginning 1st April, 1936, of  13^- millions a year will be required. To this must be added the additional cost involved in the new proposals.    It is accordingly proposed that the Exchequer contribution as from 1st April, 1930, shall be as follows:-Year	Exchequer Contribution.	Year.	Exchequer Contribution.	  millions .		  millions.1930-31	9	1938-39	171931-32	10	1939-40	181932-33	11	1940-41	191933-34	12	1941-42	201934-35	13	1942-43	211935-36	14	1943-44	211936-37	15	1944-45	211937-38	16	1945-46	21In arriving at these Exchequer contributions, effect has been given to the statutory increases of one
penny a week each, payable by employer and worker as from 1935.With the Exchequer contributions on the above scale it is estimated that the Pensions Account will be practically exhausted by 31st March, 194S.A.W.W.4th October, 1929.
Widows1, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory Pensions Bill.Brief Motes on Clauses.Clause 1 in the Bill gives effect to the proposals in the-original Cabinet Memorandum but it is now proposed to extend the class of pre-Act widows who are to benefit under the scheme.      A new clause will be necessary.This is a concession.The Clause (1)  extends the class of wives and widows who are not to suffer the disabilities ordinarily imposed to prevent abuse of the scheme in late marriage cases.      The principal Act provided that these disabilities should not apply if immediately before the marriage the woman was in receipt of a widows pension and the clause gives the same advantage to women who but for certain disentitling provisions of the principal Act would have been in receipt of widows1 pensions.(2) By an oversight five years in the proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 20 of the principal Act was not reduced to three years,  although that change was made in the corresponding provisions in Sections 3 and 7.      The anomaly is now removed.3ub-ciause (1) removes an unintentional hardship.      The amendment secures that in no case where the effective insurance has run for less than 208 weeks will the average test be applied.sub-clause (2)(a]C?/and (b) relax the conditions for widows, orphans and old age pensions by providing that the average test is not to apply in a case v?here the person on whose insurance the claim is based had been insured for not less than 10 years on attaining 60.sub-clause  (a)(11).    The object is to provide that the widow
of a man who was. entitled to an old age pension shall not he required to satisfy the ordinary conditions for a widow&apos;s pension, hut shall he entitled to such a pension aut omat i c ally.sub-clause (5).      This is designed to make it clear that a person in respect of whom the necessary qualifying contributions although due were not paid before he attained 65 cannot secure an old age pension by making up the minimum number of qualifying contributions after reaching that age.Under Proviso (Ib^ of the clause power is taken to make regulations giving credit for contributions paid after the event in certain defined circumstances. Clause 4. This clause is intended to repair certainomissions in the principal Act with regard to the disposal of additional allowances and orphans&apos; pensions in certain exceptional circumstances, e,g. where a child for whom an additional allowance is payable is living permanently with a grand-parent and not with the widow at the time of the father&apos;s death, the principal Act did not allow of payment to the grand-parent. Clause 5. This clause is intended to give certainprivileges (e.g. the right to become voluntary contribu-tors) to particular classes of persons engaged in excepted employment which experience has shown were unintentionally omitted from the provisions with regard to excepted employment in the principal Act. Clause 6. This clause extends the duration of the pensiongiven by the principal Act to pre-Act widows, and the widows of men who were over 70 at the commencement of the principal Act (non-contributory classes).     The Bill proposes to substitute IS years of age for 14- -, and anyof/
of these pensions&quot;which had ceased to he payable before the date of commencement of the new Act will be revived a3 from that date.** This clause relaxes in some respects the disqualification in the principal Act and in the Old Age pensions Act,  e...g. the general disqualification of persons detained in asylums within the meaning of the Lunacy Acts is removed and only criminal lunatics will be disqualified.      The wording of the schedule has been altered to incorporate the amendment embodied in The Local Government Act of 193)9 which allows for the continu ance of pension for the whole period of medical or surgical treatment in a poor law institution, whereas the principal Act restricted the payment to the first three months of treatment.It is considered that any claimant who can satisfy the contribution tests of the Act should not be denied pension and therefore this clause abolishes the residential test as regards contributory pensions which was imposed       the principal Act.      It is necessary, however, to retain a residential test for claimants to non-contributory pensions as there is no case for encouraging the return to this country of persons who might by so doing secure pensions   for which no contributions had ever been paid.Sub-clause (l)  allows a person in receipt of a war pension in respect of the death of a stepson to receive both the war pension and the pension under the Act.     The principal Act limited this concession to those cases in which the war pension was payable in respect of the death of the son.Sub-clause/3. .
Sub-clause (2)  is a drafting amendment. Sub-clause (3)  is to make clear that a woman entitled to an old age pension in right of her own insurance, which is not payable because she is receiving a widows pension, is to receive an old age pension if her widow&apos;s pension is terminated on remarriage. Iiuse 10. This clause abolishes the provision of theprincipal Act which cancelled or reduced additional allow-ances and orpuans&apos; pensions when Workmen&apos;s compensation was paid in respect of the father&apos;s death.      Cases which came under the original exclusion will be revived from the commencement of the new Act. ause 11. A person entitled to a pension may have to have recourse to the poor law authority for relief during the period that the claim for pension is under consideration and the principal Act allowed a poor law authority to recover from arrears of pension any relief which would not -have been granted if the pension had been in payment from the proper date.     Cases have arisen where after the pension has been put in payment, payment has through some accident ceased for a period and the pensioner has had to have help from the Guardians to tide him over that period. The main purpose of the amendment is to encourage this help to be given by allowing the poor law authority the right of recovery from the arrears due in the latter type of case.      The original section is being repealed by the Bill and both types of cases are provided for in this clause, ise 12. The principal Act required that, unless a claim was made within a month after the pension date, payment of pension was not due from that date but only from the date of the claim.This/
This clause extends the month to three months and provides further that, where more than three months have expired before the claim is made, the claimant shall receive three months arrears of pension instead of being paid only from the date of claim, lause 15. It was doubtful whether under the terms of theprincipal Act the Minister could re-open a decided case unless new facts were brought to his notice, and the principal Act also omitted to specify from what date a revised award or decision took effect where a decided case was re-opened.     The object of this clause is to rectify the position as regards these matters. Clause 14. Sub-clause 1 is to allow of the payment of sums by vray ofpension for more than six weeks during the interval between the receipt of a claim and the decision as to title to pension.     The main object of this sub-clause is to deal with the case in which the applicant for an old age pension cannot, owing to a doubt as to his age, be paid either insurance benefit or old age pension, although it is clear that he is entitled to one or the other according to whether he is under or over 65 years of age. Sub-clause 2 provides machinery for giving effect to sub-clause 3(b)  of clause 3 (see note on that sub-clause). Sub-clause 5.    The principal Act omitted to provide for the disposal of sums due to a pensioner at his death and this sub-clause makes the necessary provision. lause 15. This clause is concerned with a very minor point.The object of the provision in .the principal Act was to catch cases where a person knowingly obtained payment on account of a pension which was not payable to him, but the words used &quot;which he is disqualified for receiving&quot; were too limited.Clause /
q e5:0lause 16. This clause extends the classes of personsentitled to &quot;become voluntary contributors.The wording of Section 13(1) of the principal Act inadvertently excluded a small class from the privilege conferred viz. the revival of the right to become voluntary contributors.      Paragraph (a)  of sub-clause (l) provides for the inclusion of the omitted class.The main object of paragraph (b) of sab-clause (1)  is to allow persona who are compelled to be insured for widows&apos; and orphans&apos;  pensions purposes only, the right to become voluntary contributors and so qualify for old age pensions as well as for the benefits of the Insurance . Act s.The object of sub-clause (2) is to allow a person who before becoming insured under the National Health Insurance Acts was an exempt person or engaged in an excepted employment, to take credit for weeks when he was so employed towards making up the 104 weeks required as the qualification for becoming a voluntary contributor, lause 17. The object of sub-clause (1) is to alloy/ -(a) pensioners who emigrate to the Dominions to continue to receive their pensions;    (under the principal Act a pension is not payable while the person is outside Great Britain) -(b) insured persons who emigrate to the Dominions (i) an extension of their free period of insurance if that period would empire within a year of their leaving Great Britain;    (ii) a credit of free contributions for the period from leaving Great Britain to the date of claim if a claim for pension should arise within the period mentioned at (i);    and (iii) a title to become a voluntary contributor on payment of the pensionscontribution/
contribution only.      (The voluntary contributor in this, coimtry pa3&apos;-s the combined health and pension contribution).The remainder of the clause is mainly concerned with the modifications which will require to be made for such cases in the ordinary machinery for payment of contributions and pensions. Clause 18. The object of this clause is to remove ahardship -which a decision of the Courts showed to exist. Clause 19. The object of this clause is to alloy/ theMinistry of Labour or an Approved Society which has paid unemployment or sickness benefit to a person who turns out to be over 65 (and therefore no longer entitled to either of these benefits)  to recoup itself out of any arrears of old age pensions which may be due to the man for the period for which either of the above benefits was paid. Clause 20. The object of this clause is to make, for thepurposes of the principal Act, a child adopted under the Adoption of Children Act, 1926,  a child of the adopters and not of its natural parents. Clause 21. This clause which is applicable only to Scotland,is designed to put the referees in Scotland in the same position as the principal Act put the referees in England in the matter of stating a case for the opinion of the Court.
