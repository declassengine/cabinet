SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.With reference to the Memoranda by the First Lord of the Admiralty and by the     09.H Secretary of State for Air (OP. 243 and CP. 245 (29)&apos;) relating to the Singapore Base,     3604 I circulate for the information of my colleagues (A) a note by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on the military defences, and&apos; (B) a statement on the capital expenditure by the War Office in connection with the Base.T.S.23rd September, 1929.(A)NOTE BY THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF:1. The existing coast defences at Singapore consist of :- &quot;*S&quot;2-inch guns ...       ...       ...       ...       56-inch guns ...       ....       ... ...       4This armaWeUt was&quot; originally1 sited for the defence of Keppel Harbour only which is the commercial port of Singapore. The whole of the present armament is located at the extreme south of the Island of Singapore, and does not cover the water approaches to the Naval Base situated in the Straits north of the Island. It is, therefore, useless as a means of defence of the Naval Base unless augmented by the additions approved by the late Cabinet.2. The first stage of the&apos; Defences of Singapore as approved by the Cabinet on 4th April, 1928 (vide OLD. 317 C) was to be completed by the end of the financial year 1932-33.   These defences consist of (OLD. 329-C)-15-inch guns ... ... ... ... 39,2-inch guns ... ... ... ... 4 (including 2 already existing)6-inch guns ) ... ... ... ... 8 (including 4 already existing)A.A. guiis... ... ... ... ... 24A.A. lights ... ... ... ... 143. At the Cabinet meeting held on 19th December, 1928, the late Cabinet approved of the recommendation of the Committee of Imperial Defence that there shall be ho expenditure on the installation of 9&apos;2-inch and 15-inch guns at Singapore during the financial year 1929-30, in order to allow of adequate time for full investigation of the results of the Coast Defence trials held in 1928.(B29/17)   100   9/29   W.O.P.   4658
4. A Cabinet Committee in July, 1929, provisionally decided that &quot; whilst there is disagreement about defences the original scheme suspended by our predecessors will remain in that condition.&quot; &apos; This has been interpreted to mean that the first stage- of the programme for light guns, defence lights and anti-aircraft defences is not to be interrupted. The Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty, CP. 243 (29), Appendix I, points out &quot; The Chiefs of Staff have recommended that a squadron of torpedo bombers should be based on the port in order that the present works, oil fuel reserves, &amp;c, should not be entirely unprotected and on the assumption that the first stage of the programme of work for light guns and anti-aircraft defences is not to be interrupted.&quot;5. As a result of the Cabinet decision the following are the main items of work now in progress on which work has not been suspended : (a) Vickers&apos;  contract  for the first 15-inch gun mounting ordered prior todecision.(b) Installation of two 6-inch guns with accommodation for the garrison.(c) Installation of searchlights.(d) Construction of piers and railway line.(e) Construction of Ordnance depots and workshops. (/) Despatch of 4 anti-aircraft guns.(g) Manufacture of anti-aircraft ammunition and instruments.(B)CAPITAL EXPENDITURE BY WAR OFFICE.I.

III. Amounts that mioht be saved ie all work were closed down.In 1929.Armament. 1  the orders to  Vickers were cancelled ( 66,000), it would be necessary to pay heavy compensation of unknown amount. W(trks.- 31,000 could be saved.Subsequent years.Armament. If the Vickers orders were cancelled ( 123,000), heavy compensation would have to be paid. The remainder of the expenditure could be saved, but it might involve discharging men at the Ordnance Factories.Works. Approximately  800,000 could be saved.Land. Approximately  47,000 could be saved.But if work were closed down the War Office would of course lose the share of the future instalments of the New Zealand and Federated Malay States contributions ;  29,000 and,  92,000 respectively were allowed for in Army Estimates, 1929. The question might also arise of refund to those Governments of amounts received by the three Service Departments up to date, with a prospect of Supplementary Estimates.
