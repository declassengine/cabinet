This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]printed for the Cabinet.   September 1929.SECRET. Copy No.    32CP. 252 (29).CABINET.IRAQ.Incidence of Cost of British High Commission.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE question of the incidence of cost of the British High Commission at Baghdad was one of those discussed in the memorandum on &quot; Future Policy in Iraq,&apos;&apos; which was circulated to the Cabinet with CP. 239 (29). The points at issue are set out in paragraph 9 of that Memorandum. The minutes do not indicate that the Cabinet reached any definite conclusion on the subject.2. Briefly stated, the annual cost of the High Commission is  50,000, the whole of which is nominally borne by Iraq, although His Majesty&apos;s Government, in fact, contribute half the amount ( 25,000). It is, I think, generally accepted that, when Iraq enters the League of Nations in 1932, this arrangement must come to an end, and that the whole cost of British representation in Iraq, as in other foreign countries, must be borne by the British Exchequer.3. Even during the present transitional period the arrangement is open to serious objection. Our relations with Iraq are governed by a treaty of alliance, ostensibly as between equals. We have formally recognised the sovereign indepen-dence of Iraq. We have built up an elaborate edifice of independence, comprising a constitutional monarchy, parliamentary institutions, foreign representation abroad, and the various trappings of an independent State. Yet we give the whole edifice an appearance of unreality by requiring Iraq just as if she were a British Colony and protectorate to bear the cost of British representation in the country; and this, too, by a provision in a formal treaty which is published to the world. Little wonder that in Iraq, where amour-propre counts for much, this imposition is keenly resented. On this ground, the late High Commissioner, Sir Gilbert Clayton, strongly urged in a recent despatch that this anomaly should be removed.Iraq has in theory, if not in fact, attained to at least as great a degree of independence as has Egypt, and not unnaturally Iraqis point to Egypt, where the whole cost of the British High Commissioner and his staff is met from British funds.4. But apart from the fact that the present arrangement is very distasteful to Iraqi national sentiment, it is open to objection on practical grounds. So long as the full cost of the High Commission is borne by the Iraq Government, annual provision therefor must be voted by the Iraq Parliament, who have the constitutional right to scrutinize and amend the estimates of High Commission expenditure. In theory they could reduce the High Commissioners salary or even refuse supplies. If the Iraq Parliament were to exercise this right of financial control, and it is becoming increasingly difficult each year to dissuade them from doing so, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be placed in a position of considerable embarrassment.[19940]
25. If it were decided to do now (i.e., from the beginning of next financial year) what we must in any case do in 1932 (supposing that Iraq enters the League then), it would mean a total additional charge upon the British Exchequer that might amount to some  30,000 a year between now and then. (It is difficult to give an exact figure, because the charge would involve a revision of salary scales, to com-compensate officers for the additional British income tax to which they would become liable).I am personally satisfied that the advantage to be gained by this concession to Iraqi sentiment far outweighs the relatively small financial sacrifice. Moreover, the present arrangement seems to me anomalous in itself and inconsistent with the general character of our avowed policy in Iraq.P.Colonial Office, Downing Street, September 20, 1929.
