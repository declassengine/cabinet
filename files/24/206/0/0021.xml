HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT). CRET.P. 271( 29). COPY NO. :        ^ &apos;CABINET.THE DIRECTION OP OVERHEAD LINES ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS. Memorandum by the. Minister of Transport.As my colleagues will be aware, considerable public interest has been aroused In connection with the proposal of the Central Electricity Board to erect overhead transmission lines( between Brighton and Eastbourne, passing over the South Downs. The Prime Minister wrote to me personally on the 26th September, asking me to exercis-e my authority so that the routes to be followed will not mean destruction to the landscape.After careful consideration of the Report of the Inquiry which was held on lay behalf in September, and after personally inspecting the part of the route to which objection had been mainly taken, I decided to give my consent, subject to further consideration being given to the position of the line and its supports to the immediate south west and south east of Offham Village, and subject also to the reservation of a power to review the situation at any time after the expiration of a period of five years.I feel satisfied that this decision will not result in the . destruction of valuable amenities, but as members of the Government may be approached in the matter I append, for the information of the Cabinet, a statement showing some of the general and technical considerations which were before my mind in arriving at my decision and which may be useful in answering criticisms.(Intld. ) H.M,
A P P E H PI X,lo      There Is no practicable rente for an overhead transmission line out of Brighton which doss not necessitate crossing the Downs.:2., &quot;*  The route now proposed is agreed by ail the Local Authorities concerned to bo the least undesirable,,3c      To place this section of the 132,000 volt system underground would be ;(a) Technically impracticable, - neither the Electricity &quot;Coinmfssi oners\, the &quot;iisonau j t injg engineers who dealt with the technical aspects or the Scheme on their behalf, the technical officers of the Central Electricity Board, nor their Consultants are prepared to advise,, in the present stats of knowledge;, thatan underground cable at 3,30,000 volts would be feasible...(b) Commercially impossible - owing to the enormous expense Involved.,    the cost of the whole of the Brighton - Bastings line on the 132,000 volt overhead system will be under- 100,000s    the cost of 132y000 volt underground cables would be  900,000 Lie,,  at least nine times as much.(c),:Injurious to amenities,,      Even If underground cables at TS2&quot;rO&quot;O0 ioTts wire&quot;   either technically or commercially practicable v oil tank towers fifty feet high would he required at Intervals along the line,.      These would be definitely unsightly as they would require to be situated on all the high points of the route.,4,      The Central Electricity Board have already been approached by the Railway Company for a supply to enable tho electrification of the main line to Brighton,, and of a further section to vi/orthing, to be undertaken;    It is assumed that ultimately the electrification of the other sections serving the South coast towns will be undertaken,,The Board will be able to give a sufficient supply to the Hallway on terms which they believe will be satisfactory., but only if a &quot;grid&quot; sub-station on a main transmission ring Is located at Brighton
5o The immediate effects of omitting the Brighton - Hastings line would be :(a) Supplies required by Eastbourne, Hastings, Folkestone, Aghford and Dover by the winter of-    1930/31, and by Brighton in 1931/32, would not beavailable.     The Electricity Commissioners would have to agree to uneconomic extensions of all these stations.(b) It would be necessary to suspend during the coming winter construction of a large part of the transmission system, affecting the following contracts which are already heId up pending a decision, i,6.  -(1) Two large contracts placed with the English Electric Company and Callendars Cable Company&apos; amounting approximately to  320 j, 000 and  473,000 respectively.(2) Six other large contracts, aggregating over  863,000.The value of the work under these contracts which would be indefinitely suspended is some  750,000.(3) Further contracts which would be placed foT -       this winter would not be let;    value  400,000.(c) The Boapd would be unable to give supplies to the Railway for the electrification of the main line to Brighton and the coast extensions&quot;.&amp;a     Among the permanent effects would be:(a) That Brighton and Eastbourne would be definitely-cut out of the scheme and it would be made impossible for the wgridR to supply the coast towns above, referred top since extensions would have been given to their stations.     As a result the finances of the whole of the South East England Scheme would be so gravely imperilled that the Commissioners understand the Board consider its reconsideration&apos; would be necessary and that It would almost certainly be necessary to abandon the whole of the Kent ring,(b) The whole of the Board8s secondary development in Sussex and Kent would also have to be abandoned,,(c) This return to uncoordinated and individualistic development means that the cheaper electricity based on the National Scheme will not be available and all development, especially rural, will be retarded,7o     The reaction on other schemes of an adverse decision would be most serious.     All over the country the Board9s work has already been slowed up and they are falling behind with their programme for the execution of workso
