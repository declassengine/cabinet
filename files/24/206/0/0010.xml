5 &apos;i(&quot;J-tl?:.g document is the property of His Britannic- Ha jesty&apos; s G-overnment) SECRET .C.P.260 (29) . CJl BJ ][ 2 T .ARMISTICE DAY, hemoranduiii by the Home _Seoretary.At its meeting on the 17th July last  (Cabinet 29  (29)  Gen-elusion 10)  the Cabinet asked me to give,  if possible, more prominence to the civilian aspect of the Armistice Day ceremony than had been given on past occasions.      I have been consider-ing how effect could best be given to the wishes then expressed by my Colleagues and I think it right/ as the question involved is of some political importance, to report to my Colleagues the conclusions which I have now reached.The purpose of the annual  service at the Cenotaph is I thin]-: universally regarded as a tribute primarily to the memory of those whose death the Cenotaph commemorates - the sailors,  soldiers and airmen who lost their lives in the War. The ceremony is thus essentially military in character and it is particularly appropriate and fitting that it should be attended by representative detachments of the Fighting Services. These detachments from the Navy,  the Army and the Air Force are present somewhat in the capacity of Guards of Honour and have in past years been accoutred accordingly.Some of my Colleagues have no doubt received represent-ations that the troops should be unarmed as a symbol of the nation&apos;s will to peace.      At my request the Secretaries of State for War and Air and the First Lord of the Admiralty have examined this suggestion and have unanimously come to the conclusion that they could not contemplate the parading of Naval, Military,  or Air Force personnel on this solemn occasion otherwise than in full dress, and as the order of full dress imports the carrying of arms they are not prepared to recommend that personnel should parade without arms.      I must confess that I personally am in sympathy with this view, and subject to
the concurrence of my Colleagues I propose to arrange for the Armistice Day celebration on this basis.In my opinion, however, there should be no excessive military display and with this In mind I propose,  in consult-ation with the Ministers of the Service Departments; to reduce the number of troops on parade to approximately six hundred (300 soldiers and 300 other firms) as against eleven hundred men employed last year .      I do not think that any smaller number would afford an adequate representation of the Services These representative detachments would be dressed and armed as is customary on ceremonial occasions.This simple annual service has become more or less stereotyped during the last ten years;    it has been adopted as a model for similar services in many cities throughout the Empire and it seems to   me likely that any substantial alteration in its character would be the cause of public dissatisfaction.      1 propose therefore to make no changes in the traditional ceremonial beyond a reduction in the number of troops on parade, but before submitting a programme for The King&apos;s approval I shall be glad to know whether this will meet my Colleagues&apos; views.J.R.C24th September,  1929,,
