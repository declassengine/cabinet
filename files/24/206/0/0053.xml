ffASIOHAL ADVISORY 0 QUITO IL FOR JUVENILE MPSQXtEBNE(SHSLMD A1JD WALES t .SSOOKD      REPORE.%o the Right Honourable MarjLareJL Bondfield, &amp;UP/.,Ministry of Labour,Madam,1.     germs of Reference,At our first meeting on 22nd March, 1928, your predecessor asked us to give our earliest attention to two of the main recommendations of the Committee on Education and Industry over whioh Mr. Malcolm presided, namely, the future of Juvenile Unemployment Centres and the suggested institution of a system of Vforking Certificates in order to &quot;&quot;bridge the gapw whioh at present exists between the date of leaving school and the date of entry into insuranoe.We presented our First Report on the future of Juvenile Unemployment Centres on 9th May, 1929, and we are glad to note that this Report has received your approval.At the same time, we appointed a 3ub-Committee to consider the suggested institution of a system of V?orking Certificates, and that Committee had held three meetings when in July the President of the Board of Education announced that it was the Governments intention to raise the school leaving age to 15 in April, 1931.     Shortly afterwards you asked us to let you have our considered opinion upon the question of lowering correspondingly the minimum age for insuranoe against unemploy-ment.2.     &quot;the  Cap&quot;.At the present time the majority of boys and girls leave school shortly after their fourteenth birthday and do not become insured against unemployment until the age of 16.    Large/numbers
numbers oorne to the Employment Exchange or Juvenile Employment Bureau at the time when they leave school in order to obtain advice about their career and assistance in getting their first job, but experience shows that the contact with the Exchange or Bureau tends to decrease as soon as employment is obtained. Many Local Juvenile Committees endeavour to keep in touch with the boys and girls by different methods of &quot;industrial super-vision1&apos;, but there is no doubt that at the present time there are considerable numbers of boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 16 who are either unemployed or unsuitably employed and are not brought into contact with any official machinery or voluntary agency which could help them.     If they enter insured employment at the age of 16 they come to the Exchange or Bureau to get their first &quot;book&quot;, but they have to&quot;be in Insured employment for a period of at least thirty weeks before they are able to qualify for the receipt of benefit, and they are not therefore brought into contact with the official machinery by claiming benefit until at least thirty weeks after their sixteenth birthday.It will be seen that the raising of the statutory school leaving age by a year will automatically &quot;bridge the gap&quot; by that period, but that there will still remain a substantial gap after the age of 15. 3.     Working Certificates.We are in general agreement with the views of the Committee on Eduoation and Industry that the gap should be bridged, and we were proceeding to consider the recommendation of that Committee that for this purpose a system of Working Certificates should be instituted.     When, however, following the Governments announce-ment of their intention to raise the school leaving age, we were asked to consider lowering the age of entry into insurance, whioh in itself would go a long way to &quot;bridge the gap&quot;, we decided to postpone further consideration of the merits of a Working Oertifloate system.
LA 0 0 14*     Consideration of objections to lowering the age of insurance.In considering the question of lowering the age of entry into Insurance we had before us the first report of the Committee on Education and Industry, over whioh Mrs -Malcolm presided, and we could not ignore the fact that, whenever this proposal has been discussed, objections and difficulties have been advanced from different quarters.     We decided therefore to examine these oritloisms with some care and it may be well to set out shortly, the main objections and our views thereon.In the first place it is argued that the payment of benefit as a right to young persons is demorcliaingi  hose who receive benefit must, however, have been in insured employment and there-fore in receipt of wages for some considerable time, and must be presumed to have learnt the value of money. Moreover, boys and girls during a period of unemployment are perhaps more likely to lose self-respect and become demoralised if they have nothing in their pockets than if they are able to make a Contribution to their own support out of funds to whioh they have contributed.In the second place it is argued that the.proposal would have a prejudicial effect on the prospeot of raising the school-leaving age still further at a later date and would stereotype 15 as the proper age to leave sohool and enter employment.     It must be remembered, however, that at the present time children generally are in fact employed in industry at the age of 14, as defined in the Education Aot 1921, and that their employment is recognised by a mass of existing industrial legislation other than the Unemployment Insurance Aots, and if the question of raising the sohool leaving age to 16 does become a practical issue, it will be settled on educational grounds and will not, so far as can be foreseen, be affected by what has been the age of entry into insurance.     In order to avoid any possible doubt on this point, however, we suggest as one of the conditions (see paragralh 7(b) below) that the age of entry into insurance should be defined/without
without reference to any particular age but as. being not less than the statutory sohool leaving age as established by Statute from time to time.In some quarters the fear has been expressed that, if the age is lowered, children will be tempted to leave school as soon as possible so as to qualify for benefit at the earliest possible age.     Ihe primary consideration however that weighs with both parents and children in deciding when to leave school is in most cases the possibility of earning wages, and in comparison with this point the likelihood of qualifying for benefit must be a remote and negligible factor, especially in view of the anticipated shortage of juvenile labour following the raising of ,the sohool leaving age.     In order, however, to meet any possible criticism on this score, we suggest as one of the conditions (see paragraph 7 (e) below) that contributions should be credited in respect of continued voluntary education, so that it may be possible for a child to attend sohool and yet do something towards qualifying for benefit at the same time.From other quarters the proposal is oritioised on the ground that it will involve a further charge on British Industry already burdened by the cost of social services. Ehe contributions, however, whicn employers would have to pay in respect of juveniles under the age of 16 would be very small, and employers ought to reap a real advantage from the improved facilities for supervision which would be afforded under the proposal.Finally there is the argument that the shortage of juvenile labour available for industry as a result of the war-time birth rate and the raising of the sohool leaving age will for many years be such that there will be no juvenile unemployment and therefore no need for insurance against it./So
A ft Qu uSo far as oan be foreseen, however, there will always be packets of unemployed juveniles in certain areas, and in any ease it is wise for workers to insure daring years of good employment against the risks that are more likely to befall them in later years, 5*     Advantages of the proposal0On the other hand there are in the proposal certain definite advantages..One of the main problems, which we were asked to consider when the Council was first appointed, was how to &quot;bridge the gap&quot;, to whioh we have referred in paragraph 2 above.     We realise that to lower the age of entry into insurance to coincide with the school-leaving age would not completely effect that object, but it would go a long way in that direction.     It would, for instance, ensure that every boy and girl on first entering industry would have to go to the Bureau or Exchange to get an Unemployment Book, and could thus be brought directly into touch with the Voluntary Agencies concerned with the welfare of children during the early years of their industrial life.     Moreover, whenever juveniles became unemployed and claimed benefit, they would similarly be brought into touch with the official machinery and the Voluntary Agencies.In our First Report we recommended the establishment of Centres or Classes for unemployed boys and girls in all areas where there is a substantial amount of unemployment among them, but we were aware of the difficulty that, in the absence of compulsory powers whioh we were disinclined to recommend, there was no means of securing the attendance (other than of a purely voluntary oharacter) of unemployed boys and girls who were not entitled to benefit.     The requirement to attend was therefore limited to those boys/ and
and girls who had had at least thirty weeks1 work sinoe reaching the age of 16.     If the age of insurance were lowered by a year, the requirement to attend Centres- or Classes would also be extended automatically hy a year and would cover a large portion.of the unemployed juvenile population.     Experience shows that in most areas the great majority of children will rather attend a Centre than forfeit benefit.     As regards the children who will not be entitled to benefit, even after the age of entry into insurance is lowered, we provide in our reoommendations an inducement to attend the Centre by the system of crediting contributions in respect of attendance (see paragraph 7 (e) below).Apart, however,  entirely from all question of &quot;bridging the gap&quot;, there are reasons why the age of entry Into Insurance should correspond with the age of entry into employ-ment.     An industrial insurance scheme should cover the risks of industrial life, and it is wise to begin insuring during the years when the chances of unemployment are remote against the time when the risks are far greater.     There is no logioal reason why insurance should not begin until a year after entry into employment. 6.     Reoommendat ions.For these reasons we recommend that, when the statutory sohool leaving age is raised to at least 15, the minimum age for insurance against unemployment should be lowered correspondingly,     We would, however, recommend that, in the case of juveniles, certain specific conditions should be laid down in the statute, and without these conditions some of us would not have made this recommendation.     These conditions are set out in paragraph 7 below.It should be understood that the recommendation is entirely dependent on the raising of the sohool leaving age/to
to at least 15.     If for any reason that et ep is not taken, we would desire to review &quot;de novo&quot; the whole problem of how to &quot;&quot;bridge the gap&quot;.We have already explained (see paragraph 5 above) that our recommendations will not completely &quot;bridge the gap&quot;, hut they have &quot;the great advantage that, whereas at the present time, as explained in paragraph 2 above, contact tends to decrease between the ages of 14 and 16, under our proposals unemployed insured juveniles will, by the mere fact of being insured, attend regularly at the Exchange or Bureau and can thus be brought within the ambit of definite machinery comprising both official and voluntary agencies.     We desire to make it clear that our proposals will not lessen but will rather increase the need and create the fuller opportunity for the development of the services already -provided in most parts of the oountry by voluntary Committees and by the staffs of the Juvenile Employment Bureaux and the Juvenile Departments of Employment Exchanges for giving advice to children on leaving school about the choice of their career and giving them all possible assistance during the early years of their industrial life.7.     She Conditions.She conditions which we would recommend are as follows:-(a) the age should not be lowered until the statutory sohool leaving age is raised to at least 15;(b) the age should be the age of entry into insured employment, being not lesu than the school leaving age as established by Statute from time to time. Children who obtain employment at a younger age than the age at wnich they are legally exempt from school attendance should not be insured;
(a)    the clause in the Bill should he drafted so as to make any amending legislation in regard to unemployment insurance unnecessary if ana when it were decided to raise the school leaving age further(d) attendance at a Junior Instruction Centre or an alternative approved course of instruction should be the normal condition for the receipt of unemployment benefit by all juveniles under the age of 18;(e) unemployment insurance contributions should be credited in respect of voluntary continued full-time education and voluntary attendance at Junior Instruction Centres and Day Continuation Schools after the statutory minimum School leaving age, under conditions specified in the Appendix.We have the honour to be, Madam, Your obedient Servants,(Signed)    Shaft esbury Max J.

mNATIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR JUVENILE EMPLOYMENT (ENGLAND &amp; WALES).Minority Report by Mr. F. Holroyd, J.P*., Mr. John A. Gregorson, Mr. Herbert Kay, Mr. J. 0. A. Ward and Mr. J. B. Forbes Watson.(1) Wo find ourselves unable to subscribe to the Majority Report for the following reasons.(2) The present school-leaving age is 14 plus,  i.e., 14 years plus the remainder of the school term in which the juvenile reaches 14.The Majority Report recommends that, as and when the present school-leaving age of 14 plus is raised to at least 15, the present Unemployment Insurance age of 16 should be lowered to that new school-leaving age.It further recommends that, if juveniles remain on at school or attend certain classes beyond the new school age, they should be credited with Uhem-ployment Insurance contributions - up to a maximum of 20 towards, the 30 con-tributions necessary before a juvenile can draw Unemployment Insurance benefit.The Majority Report makes it clear that, unless accompanied by this ar-rangement, making it &quot;possible for a child to attend school and y6t do some-thing towards qualifying for benefit at the same time&quot;, some of the signatories to the Majority Report would not have signed it.(3) The Majority Report speakB throughout in terms of &quot;bridging a gap&quot; and we mayconveniently summarise our views by saying that, in our opinion, the so-called &quot;gap&quot; is, for practical purposes, imaginary and, further, that the suggested &quot;bridge&quot; will react prejudicially upon the juveniles concerned, upon the ^funda-mental principles of the Unemployment Insurance system, and upon the competitive power of British industry.(4) When a juvenile leaves school and obtains work and continues at work there is no situation which can be described as a &quot;gap&quot;.     It is only when juveniles are unable to find work and are at these critical years exposed to demoralisation that a wgap** can be said to exist.Such a &quot;gap&quot; has existed for some years past and, today, as against 10 per cent, of adult unemployment, juvenile unemployment is 2 per cent.Owing to the low birth-rato in the War years, however, we are now on the verge of a period when that &quot;gap&quot; will cease to exist, and when this country will be faced with an acute shortage of juveniles,(5) The/
(5) The following Tables, compiled from a Lfemoramdura submitted to the Council by the Ministry of Labour - Council Memorandum No.? - show the actual shortage of juveniles that will exist during the next 10 years (a) on the basis of a school-leaving age of 14 plus, and (b) on the basis of a school-leaving age of 15;   the number of available posts . or juveniles being throughout taken as no higher than those actually filled by juveniles in 1927 :-(A) WITH SCHOOL AGE 14+.Year.

n. shortage of 428,000, rising in 1934 to a shortage of 762,000 - by whioh time there would be only some li-million juveniles available to fill some 3 million juvenile posts.As above oxplained, the foregoing Tables express the shortage of juven-iles in relation to the number of posts actually filled toy juveniles in 1927. Any improvement, therefore, in trade within the next 10 years, reflecting an increase in the number of posts available for juveniles, would mean a still greater shortage of juveniles than that shown above. (7) The shortage of juveniles in the above Tables is not a matter of speculation but may almost bo stated as a mathematical certainty.     The number of births in any one year determines the number of juveniles who will be available to leave school 14 or 15 years thereafter, and, as above explained, it is the low birth-rate in the War years that accounts for, and is reflected in, the acute shortage of juveniles which we have roferrod to. (8) It is on these facts that we hold the view that the &quot;gap&quot; referred to in the Majority Report is, for practical purposes, imaginary.We, of course, recognise that even with this grave shortage of juveniles there will still be, from time to time and in varying districts, a certain number of juveniles unemployed for short periods while they change from one employment to another more suited to their inclinations and aptitudes, but, bearing in mind that the actual shortage of juveniles will amount to hundreds of thousands, these normal readjustments of juvenile employment can, in our opinion, be in no sense regarded as constituting a &quot;gap&quot; which requires to be &quot;bridged&quot; by the far-reaching measures contemplated in the Majority Report.On the contrary, cur view is that, even with a school-leaving age of 14 plus and inevitably more so if the school-leaving&quot; age is raised to 15, the problem which the industry of this country will have to face will not be that of finding jobs for unemployed juveniles, but of finding available juveniles to fill vacant jobs.(9) The &quot;bridge&quot; which the Majority Report recommends - the lowering of the Unem-ployment Insurance age and the crediting of Unemployment Insurance contribu-tions in respect of continued education - is, in our opinion, based on the payment of Unemployment Benefit to these juveniles. Th9 only/
The only compulsory contact v/hich the insured juvenile in question will have with the Employment Exchange - apart from the getting of his first unemployment insurance hook - will be when he is unemployed and has to visit the Exchange or attend-, a Junior Instruction Centre as a condition of his drawing benefit. &quot;*We held the view that the contact of a juvenile with the employment exchange should be with the Exchange as an employment placing agency and not,.as an unemployment benefit paying agency, and in that connection we wish torefer to the Report of the Committee on Unemployment Insurance - preside over by the Rt. Hon. Lord Blanesburgh - which, in its review of the wholeunemployment system in 1936, saidnIh regard to the unemployment benefit of juveniles, we should &quot;consider it unfortunate if, as a result wf receiving benefit through &quot;the Employment Exchanges, these young people were led to regard the &quot;Exchanges primarily as places for obtaining money when out of w*rk. &quot;At such an age an attitude of this kind is bound to be demoralising. &quot;Our desire is that the Exchanges shall be for them the places where &quot;they can, through the staff and the Advisory Committee, receive &quot;helpful guidance fer their future careers&quot;.It was to avoid such possibility of demoralisation that we originated and advocated before the Council a scheme of Working Certificates for bring-ing juveniles in touch with the Employment Exchange as a purely labour placing agency, and the reducing of the Unemployment Insurance age therefore destroys the whole purpose which that Working Certificate scheme had in view.(10) Finally, the principle of crediting fictitious Unemployment Insurance.contribu-tions to juveniles in respect of their continued education is, in our opin-ien, open to the gravest objections.(11) In the first place, it is a revival of the expedient which was temporarilyintroduced into the Unemployment Insurance Acts in 1921 for the purpose of paying &quot;Uncovenanted&quot; benefit and which gradually undermined and finally destroyed the fundamental principles of the original Unemployment Insurance Act, under which the solvency of the Fund was safeguarded, and the genuine-ness of the claimant tested, by an automatic rule which limited the number of benefits any olaimant could draw out of the Fund in direct ratio to the number of actual contributions paid into the Fund by, or on behalf of, him.(12) In the/
5.(12) In the second place, this crediting of contributions - without any payment being made by anyone into the Fund - must, so far as benefits are paid in respect of these contributions, add still further to the debt on the Unem-ployraent Insurance Fund **.ich already stands at fully  36 millions.(13) In the third place, it seems to us fundamentally wrong in principle that an Unemployment Insurance scheme, based on the contributions, not only of the State but of Employers and Soakers, should be used for. the furtherance of educational objects which are entirely outside the scope and objects of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme.(14) In the fourth place, the inducing of juveniles to delay their entry into em-ployment through the crediting of Unemployment Insurance contributions will aggravate still further the acute shortage of juveniles available for employ-ment in this country throughout the next 10 years.(15) In our view, the welfare of the juvenile cannot be divorced from the welfare of the country, and the welfare of the country cannot be divorced from tho power of its industry to compete in the markets of the World.It is, therefore, perhaps sufficient for us to point out, in justifica-tion of our attitude, -that such inducements to cause juveniles to delay their entry into employment find no place in competing countries such, for example, as France and Germany where the school-leaving age is already lower - in France more than a year lower - than the present school-leaving age of 14 plus in Great Britain.(Signed) F.

Hote of dissont from th&quot; second Report of tho National Advisory Council for Juvenile Employment  (Engl-yad .xad Wales).During the course, of its deliberations, tho SpecialSub-Committee of the Counoil received the following request from the Minister of Labour:-&quot;... that, having regard to the Government&apos;s decision to take the necessary steps to r.aise the school -leaving age to 15, the Minister wishes to have the considered opinion of the national Advisory Council for Juvenile Employment (England and Wales) upon the question of lowering correspondingly the minimum a.r,-e for insurance against unemployment&quot;.This reference from the Minister has been considered atseveral meetings of the Sub-Committee with the result that,by a majority vote, the Sub-Committee recommend the Councilto express approval of the proposal to lower the unemploymentInsurance age of juveniles from IS years to approximately15 years.     The Council, by a majority vote, approved therecommendation.as a representative, on the Council, of the Association ofEducation Committees of England and Wales and of NorthernIreland, I have opposed the proposal to reduce&quot; the age of insurance, and I desire to place such dissent on recordsThe following reasons are submitted for dissent:-The national Advisory Council was appointed &quot;to examine and discuss matters arising out of the Malcolm Committee&apos;s Report (First Part) and allied questions and to advise the Minister thereon&quot;;and the Sub-Committee of the Council was requested &quot;to examine how far a standard or pattern scheme of Juvenile Unemployment Centres can be drawn up which could be applied in localities as and when sporadic unemployment is found to exist, and to report on this question to the Council with special regard to the following aspects:-(l)    Criteria for determining the setting up and closing of Centres:(2)   Finance:
(3)    Organisation and Coo.trol:(4)   Character of the instruction:(S)   Methods of securing --^tendance.Also to explore the possibility of drarring up in detail a draft forking Certificate scheme which will focus before the Council the various issues involved&quot;.I have assumed that the value of any proposal of the NationalAdvisory Council should be tested by its effectiveness.In improving the position of unemployed juveniles, preventingdeterioration of such juveniles, a&amp;d establishing a meansof supervision,  care and training during the poriod ofunemp 1 oym ent.The proposal to reduce the age of insurance may have political significance, but with this the Council has no concern.      It is also stated that the inclusion within the insurance seheme of young people between 15 and 16 years of age will constitute a financial advantage to an insurance fund which is in debt to the extent of  35,000,000.     The National -advisory Council is^ concerned with educational and social advantages to the juveniles themselves, and not with means of improving the financial position of the insurance fund. In 1924, the association of Education Committees opposed a proposal to reduce the age of insurance for juveniles by deputation to the Minister of Labour, by promoting opposition in the douse of Commons, and, subsequently, by their evidence before the Malcola Committee.During the last six months, I have circulatised the 267 Education Committees which are members of the association requesting their vie?rs on the proposal in order that I might the more correctly represent their present vierfs on the proposals     Of those who gave a definite decision, a large majority was in favour of the forking Certificate, and agiinet the lowering of the age of unemployment insurance./immediately
Immediately before- the.-filial -decision was-taken. by the\National Advisory Council on the proposal, the&quot; sub-si^ajace-of this note of dissent was placed before the Executive Committee, of the Association of Education Committees with the result that the Executive passed a resolution dissenting from the proposal to lower the age of Insurance.I am, therefore, dissenting from the proposal to lower the age of insurance for reasons, of which some are as follows: -*(a) As a representative of the Association of Education Oommittees, I shall be carrying out the policy of the Association as previously expressed, and, for the purpose of this report,&apos;as ne-affirmed by the Executive Committee of the Association.(b) I am in full agreement with the policy of the Association.(c ) The lowering of the age of insurance is not an effective means of securing the supervision, care and training of unemployed juveniles.(d ) The Majority Report states -MIf the age of insurance were lowered by a year, the requirement to attend Centres or Classes would also be extended automatically by a year and would cover a large portion of the unemployed juvenile population&quot;.It will be seen what little justification there is for this claim when it is realised that, whilst there are 517 Local Education Authorities in England and Wales,- there are, at the present time, only 31 Looal Education Authorities administering Juvenile Unemployment Centres.(e ) In practice, beoause of the 30 weeks&apos; qualifying period, the lowering of-the insurance age will not effect either supervision or control or training in the case of juveniles from the time they leave school at 15 plus until they reaoh the age of 16 years.   .it) In the many areas where there is no Unemployment Centre, when juveniles between 16 years and 18 years be (Some claimants to /benefit, the only compulsion Imposed upoh tiiem is a dally visit to the Juvenile Employment Bureau, or, in a large majority of oases, the Employment Exchange. Indeed* there.are cases where such juveniles are only required to attend once or three times each week, as the case may be.     This seems to be regarded as keeping oonfact with the juveniles e So far as the officials of the Bureau, or the Exchange, are concerned) it Is little more than momentary contact and provides no contribution towards educational supervision and training./On
On th e s e visits, especially to tn.e ^^1^7vmJeinfc. Exchange, ther*e.,are other and more prolonged contacts that may be anything but desirable.(g) It is suggested that the forfeiture of unemployment pay is a sufficient lever to ensure attendance at Unemployment Centres yrhere the necessary training can be given.      In the first place, there are many areas in which no Unemployment Centres have been,  or will be, established;    in the second place, even ??here Centres have been established, attendance can only be relied upon ?there the juveniles are required to attend approximately half-time,in which case the remaining half of their time is entirely at their own disposal.     In Manchester where full-time attendance at the Centres has been required, it has been common for juveniles to forego unemployment pay rather than attend the Centres.(h) It is, therefore, suggested that the mere lowering of the age of insurance in the case of unemployed juveniles between 15 and 16 years of age will have none of the results desired;    in the caseof many unemployed juveniles between 16 and 18 years of age where no Centres have been, or will be established, will do no more than provide a daily visit to the Bureau or Exchange; and, in the case of juveniles between 16 and 18 years of age in.areas where Centres are established, will, In practice, provide only for a half-time training.(i) The Insurance Acts give a legal right of possession to the juvenile in respect of unemployment benefit.     As a general principle, it is not a desirable thing to reduce.theage at vrhich such legal right is vested in the child.(j ) Admission to unemployment insurance at 15 years of age will put the stamp of industrialism upon the juvenile more securely than is the case at the present time, and the bringing together, In the manner proposed, of the age at which educational compulsion ceases and industrial insurance compulsion begins will inevitably tend to stereotype 15 years as the definite passing of the juvenile from education to industry-     It is to be expected that the opposition to the raising of the school age in future will be enormously strengthened&quot;by the reduction of the insurance age.     At the present time, the period from 15 to 16 years of age may be regarded as neutral ground to which education has, for many years, maintained a claim.      It is ground which will be more securely occupied by industry.     It will certainly not be regarded as neutral ground by Industry or by anyone opposed to the raising of the school age in future.      In this connection it may be observed that if the financial advantage arising from the inclusion of juveniles between 15 and 16 years of ac*e in the scheme of insurance be regarded to-day as of some little benefit to the insurance fund, it is not the less likely that, in future, it will be regarded as something that should be retained for a similar reason./The

21st October, 1929.National Advisory Council for Juvenile Employment (Scotland)In a letter addressed to me as Chairman of the Council in August last, it was intimated that you desired to learn the Council&apos;s views at an early date on the question of the age of entry into Unemployment Insurance and other matters related thereto.     A copy of the letter to which I refer is attached, together with a Report setting out the considered conclusions of the Council on the points raised.The Council recognise that, whatever may be the virtues of a Working Certificate Scheme, there would not be sufficient justification for the introduction of such a scheme as a measure for the better supervision of boys and girls when the existing gap is so substantially reduced as it will be by the raising of the school leaving age.   We have accordingly endorsed the views of Lord SalvesenTs Committee and the Report which I now submit embodies our recommendations as to the lowering of the age of entry into Unemployment Insurance and the conditions under which the change might be made.I am, Madam,Your obedient Servant.(Sgd) ELGIN.CHAIRMAN.The Rt.Hon.Margaret Bondfield,M.P., Minister of Labour, Montagu House,-Whitehall, S.W.1.Madam,
NATIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL for JUVENILE EMPLOYMENT t (SCO TLAND)Divisional Office, &apos;Edinburgh,2nd August,1929.Dear Lord. Elgin,As you know we arranged to postpone the next meeting of the National Advisory Council for Juvenile Employment until we oould get further information about the wishes of the new Government.I have now heard that Miss Bondfield would be glad if the Council would give early consideration to the question of whether the age of entry into Unemployment Insurance should be lowered, particularly in the light of the recent decision to raise the school-leaving age to 15 in April, 1931.You will remember that the Salvesen Committee recommended that, when the school-leaving age was raised to 15 years, the age of entry into Unemployment Insurance should be lowered, and their recommendation in regard to Working Certificates was admittedly only a temporary expedient.Miss Bondfield is hoping to introduce an Unemployment Insurance Bill in the House in the Autumn, and would be glad of the advice of the Council by the middle of October.     Among the questions that we should have to consider are the following:-(1) Should the age of entry into Unemployment Insurance &quot;be lowered?,(2) If so, when?.(3) What should be the conditions for the receipt of   benefit?.(4) What should be the rate of &quot;benefit: should it be a flat rate or vary according to age?.(5) What should be the rate of contributions?.It is, perhaps, too muoh to hope that the Council may reach a conclusion on all these points at one Meeting, and I think) therefore, that we ought to be prepared to hold two Meetings, if possible, before the middle of October.     In that case, one meeting should presumably be held in September.     Perhaps you would be good enough to let me know what date would suit you.We are preparing a memorandum on the whole subject for circulation to the Council.Yours sincerely,J.M. CRAMOND.Rt.Hon.The Early of Elgin, CM.G..LL.D.,
MTIQHAL ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR JUVENILEEMPLOTIGH1   (SCOTLAND). Unemployment Insurance&apos; Age of Entry.1.      After the meeting on 11th April, 1929j the Council, having concluded their deliberations regarding a permanent scheme for the establishment and administration of Junior Instruction Centres, intended to proceed with the detailed consideration of a Working Certificate Scheme.     In view, however, of the General Election which was pending and the subsequent change of Government it was felt - particularly with the announcement of the Governments decision to raise the school-leaving age to 15 in April 1931 -that the general position should be reconsidered and in accordance with the request of the Minister of Labour, the Council turned their attention to the question of whether the age of entry into Unemployment Insurance should be lowered,2.      At the outset? it was pointed out that the raising of the school-leaving age in conjunction with the lowering of the age of entry into Unemployment Insurance would not close completely the exisiing gap in the public supervision of young persons between the ages of 14 and 16.     The Council, however, after very oareful consideration and taking into account that the raising of the school-leaving age would substantially reduce the gap, came to the conclusion that -(i) it is inadvisable to proceed with the-consideration of a Working Certificate Scheme unless, and until, Compulsory Day Continuation Classes are brought into general operation?(ii) the age of entry intoi Unemployment Insurance should &quot;be lowered if and when the school leaving age is raised to 15.The Council do not doubt that in the event of statutory effect being given to their recommendations the relative clauses in the Bill will &quot;be so drafted as to make it plain that there is no intention of stereotyping any particular age as the age of leaving school or of entering employment,3.      The Council, then, in submitting this as their considered recommendation desire at tho same time to add(a) that in the case of juveniles of 15 to 16, no difference should be made in the conditions for the time being existing and applicable to juveniles of IS to 18 years of age;/(b)
(b) that there should be only one class of juveniles for the purposes of Unemployment Insurance, and that this class embracing those between the ages of 15 and 18 should pay contributions and receive benefit at uniform rates subject only to such differences as may be determined in the rates applicable to boys and girls respective^.(c) that normally benefit should be paid directly to the olaimant.4.      Finally, the Council consider that continued education should be encouraged by crediting the boy or girl provisionally at the expense of the State with Unemployment Insurance contributions in respect of the -period spent at some full time day school beyond the statutory leaving age at the rate of one contribution for two ?;eeks&apos; attendance, but subject to an age limit of 18 years and a maximum of twenty contributions, Such contributions would&apos; become effective for the purpose of benefit only provided the juvenile claimant has actually entered insurable employment and has subsequently become unemployed.
