[This Docaineat ia the Propyty of His Bwtaiuiic Majesty&apos;g Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1929.SECRET.Copy No. .31CP. 267 (29).CABINET.RUSSIA.Conversations with Soviet Representative and Protocol.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues the accompanying record of my conversations with the Soviet representative, M. Dovgalevsky, together with the text of the protocol recording the results of these discussions.Record of a Conversation between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and M. Dovgalevsky, 11 a.m., September 24, 1929. *THE question was raised whether shorthand notes should be taken of the conversation, and it was decided that this was unnecessary.The Secretary of State then said that he proposed to indicate to M. Dovgalevsky the subjects for dealing with which a procedure had to be settled, and handed to M. Dovgalevsky a list of questions for discussion.M. Dovgalevsky said that his understanding was that the question to be settled was simply one of formal procedure. The sequence of events he contemplated was that the British Government should decide on the resumption of relations and that, after the necessary parliamentary approval had been obtained, outstanding questions could then be discussed by the appointed Ambassadors according to the procedure to be settled as a result of the present conversation.In reply to an enquiry from the Secretary of State, M. Dovgalevsky said that at first sight he saw no objection to the list of subjects handed to him. He was, of course, not familiar with the various questions involved, but if the procedure he had indicated was followed, he felt that there would probably be no objection to the list.The Secretary of State then reminded M. Dovgalevsky of the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government in this matter as explained to him during the previous negotiations at the end of July, and M. Dovgalevsky replied that he thought there was no misunderstanding, but laid stress on the fact that the procedure to be decided upon had reference to both the resumption of relations and to the questions for discussion. In reply to a further enquiry from the Secretary of State as to what exactly he had in mind, M. Dovgalevsky explained that, as the agreement of Parliament was necessary, any negotiations now undertaken would be of a purely preliminary character, and that, in his opinion, the best course would be that diplomatic relations should be resumed and Ambassadors appointed in the first place. After that had been done, the points at issue between^the two Governments could then be dealt with according to any procedure which might now be settled.* This paper was circulated at the last meeting (CP. 259 (29) ), but is repeated for convenience.A. H.October 4, 1929.[N 4293/18/38]No. 1.5066   [19985]b
There were also a number of practical questions which Would arise, such as the place where negotiations should take place, the appointment of delegates, &amp;c.The Secretary of State pointed out that his proposal was that he and M. Dovgalevsky should agree on suitable methods for dealing with the subjects enumerated on his list and with any other subjects which the Soviet Government on their side might wish to add to that list. If they succeeded in reaching an agreement as to ^ the procedure for dealing with these matters, their proposals would then be submitted to the two Governments for their approval.On M. Dovgalevsky enquiring what would happen if the two Governments did not approve the agreement reached, Mr. Henderson suggested that further meetings should take place, and that a settlement as to procedure could be reached before the meeting of Parliament.If so, when parliamentary approval had been obtained, the ordinary diplomatic machinery could be reinstituted, and the agreed procedure for dealing with outstanding questions could at once be brought into force.M. Dovgalevsky then enquired as to the present position of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Was he to understand that His Majesty&apos;s Government had definitely decided, as soon as parliamentary approval could be obtained, to re-establish diplomatic relations and to exchange Ambassadors 1 Was it, in fact, their decision to resume diplomatic relations as soon as an agreement on procedure had been reached and parliamentary approval obtained ?The Secretary of State again explained that the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government was as stated to M. Dovgalevsky at the previous meeting. If an agreement could be reached on procedure His Majesty&apos;s Government hoped to bring that procedure into operation after Parliament met and to proceed to the exchange of Ambassadors.M. Dovgalevsky expressed his agreement with the course of action indicated. He asked that further discussion should be postponed for two days in order to enable him to examine the list of subjects handed to him. He enquired whether it was proposed to make suggestions on the procedure for dealing with each subject on that list. The Secretary of State replied in the affirmative, and said that the 1924 treaty would afford a valuable precedent for dealing with some, at any rate, of the subjects to be dealt with. He offered to hand M. Dovgalevsky, at a subsequent meeting, a memorandum of his proposals for dealing with the questions enumerated.M. Dovgalevsky then returned to his previous suggestions and expressed the -opinion that a number of&quot; the subjects included in the list might preferably be dealt with by the Ambassadors of the two countries when appointed.. Considerable discussion then took place, during which the Secretary of State referred to M. LitvinofFs reply to his recent invitation, in which he expressed the Soviet Government&apos;s readiness to discuss methods of procedure, and explained that the kind of proposals he had in mind dealt simply with methods of procedure and not with the merits of the questions. M. Dovgalevsky laid stress on the difficulty of deciding details at this stage. He argued that the question now to be settled was how negotiations were to be carried out, whether by Ambassadors, commissions, conferences, &amp;c, and expressed the opinion that it would be better to leave all details for settlement later. The Secretary of State pointed out the great advantage of carrying matters as far as possible at the present stage. He asked M. Dovgalevsky to consider the programme given to him and then, if the programme could be agreed upon, to consider the procedure for dealing with the various items upon it. If the present negotiations resulted in an agreement on the programme and on the procedure, it would then be possible, so soon as parliamentary approval could be -obtained, to bring the whole system into operation.M. Dovgalevsky then returned to the point he had already made as to the difficulty of deciding the details of procedure at this stage, and asked whether, even if the list were agreed upon and the procedure for dealing with the various questions settled, much progress would have been made, as he had no authority to deal with any of these questions on their merits. The Secretary of State again referred to the termsrof his invitation, and pointed out that all he asked was that, in accordance with iVI. Litvinoffs acceptance, a start should be made with settling the procedure for dealing with outstanding questions. He pointed out that it was perfectly possible, for example, to settle whether the question of debts should be dealt with by a commission or by some other way. The Governments and publics of both countries expected some arrangement to be made on the question of procedure, and further delays were merely provocative of rumour and made the situation more difficult.
M. Dovgalevsky then agreed to proceed with the negotiations on the lines suggested by the Secretary of State and asked whether he could at once be given some indication of the procedure which His Majesty&apos;s Government proposed for dealing with at any rate some of the questions enumerated on the list.The Secretary of State said that he would prefer not to make definite proposals at the moment, but that he would be prepared to-morrow to hand M. Dovgalevsky a memorandum showing the procedure he suggested. After further discussion it was agreed that a further meeting should take place on Wednesday, the 25th September, at 4 p.m.Foreign Office, September 24,1929.List of Questions for Discussion with the Soviet Representative.

Propaganda.IN their note of the 23rd July the Soviet Government undertook, on the resumption of diplomatic relations, that they would &quot; assume the rights and duties of States in diplomatic relations between themselves as soon as the British Govern-ment takes upon itself these right and duties.&quot;It is proposed to interpret this by mutual pledges at the moment of the actual exchange of Ambassadors on the lines of article 16 of the 1924 treaty, which ran as follows : &quot; The contracting parties solemnly affirm their desire and intention to live in peace and amity with each other, scrupulously to respect the undoubted right of a State to order its own life within its own jurisdiction in its own way, to refrain and to restrain all persons and organisations under their direct or indirect control, including organisations in receipt of any financial assistance from them, from any act overt or covert liable in any way whatsoever to endanger the tranquillity or prosperity of any part of the territory of the British Empire or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or intended to embitter relations of the British Empire or Union of Soviet Socialist Republics with their * neighbours or any other countries.&quot;2. Arrangements in regard to Diplomatic and Considar Missions and their Staffs.(a.) Assuming that the Soviet representative will raise the question of special diplomatic privileges for the head of their trading organisations in London on the re-establishment of diplomatic relations and the exchange of Ambassadors, it is proposed to meet this request by a suggestion on the lines of article 2 (i) of the draft Commercial Treaty of 1924 under which the heads of the Trading Delegation would be regarded as members of the Union Embassy in London and as such enjoy the privileges and immunities appertaining thereto.* This memorandum was circulated at the last meeting (CP. 259 (29) ), but is repeated for convenience.
(&amp;.) The arrangements in regard to the selection of places at which consular missions shall be established in each country shall form the subject of discussion after the exchange of diplomatic missions. In the meantime, in order to facilitate trade between the two countries, it might be suggested to the Soviet representatives that facilities should immediately be afforded for the appointment of consuls in one or two of the more important places in each country.(c.) The expediency of the release of the Russian subjects previously employed at the British mission in Moscow should be emphasised to the Soviet representative if such release has not already been effected.3. Debts.(A.)-Inter-Governmental Debt and Claims including War Loan and Counter-claims (claims by the Soviet Government arising out of British inter-vention in Russia and financial relations between the Governments during the war).It is suggested that as provided in the treaty of 1924 these claims should be reserved for discussion at a later date.(B.) Claims of British Holders of Russian Pre-Revolution Bonded Govern-mental and Municipal Debt.(C.) Claims by British Companies and Nationals in Respect of Nationalised Properties and Concessions.(D.) Miscellaneous Claims (including shares in Russian companies, personal injuries, debt due from Russian firms, money confiscated, moveable and immoveable property, and corresponding Russian claims).It is suggested that a joint committee consisting of not less than five and not more than seven representatives of each Government shall be appointed with the following terms of reference :  &quot; To examine the problems arising out of the claims under (B), (C) and (D) set out above with a view to recommending to the two Governments an equitable settlement of such problems for incorporation in a later treaty between the two Governments.   Such a settlement should have regard to &quot; (a.) Its acceptance by a substantial proportion of the claimants affected; &quot; (b.) The financial and economic position of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics;&apos;&apos; (c.) The establishment of such financial and commercial relations between the two countries as will secure an early development of mutual trade.&quot;The British committee should be appointed by His Majesty&apos;s Government after -consultation with the interests concerned. It is suggested that it might be wrell to include as members of the committee the following : A nominee of the Governor of the Bank of England who could be regarded as representing the interests of bondholders.A representative of the Joint Stock Banks.A representative of industry, nominated after consultation with Federation of British Industries.A representative of concessionnaires and other British business interests established in Russia previous to the Revolution.A representative of the organised workers, to be appointed after consultation with the General Council of the Trades Unions.4. Fisheries.An agreement to be negotiated by nominated representatives of the two Governments on the lines of that contained in the treaty of 1924. In the meantime and simultaneously with the re-establishment of diplomatic relations the provisional arrangement of 1923 to be revived by which the Soviet Government undertook to instruct its officials on the northern coast of the territory of the Union to refrain from interfering with British subjects in vessels without the 3-mile limit. This provisional arrangement to be put into force by an exchange of notes.
[N 4353/18/38] No. 3.Record of Conversation between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andM. Dovgalevsky, September 25, 1929.THE Secretary of State reminded M. Dovgalevsky that he had undertaken to give him at the present meeting a memorandum showing the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom for the procedure to be adopted for dealing with outstanding questions between the two Governments. In accordance with.this undertaking, he handed to M. Dovgalevsky a memorandum (annexed) indicating the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government as regards the various questions enumerated on the list given to the Soviet representative on the 24th September.The Secretary of State then read the memorandum to M. Dovgalevsky, observing that, while it was the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to present a report to Parliament immediately at the beginning of the next session, it must be understood that, owing to British parliamentary procedure, this could not be done during the first two or three days of the session.M. Dovgalevsky said that he was not in a position to express any views on the memorandum during the present meeting. He asked, however, whether it was the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the reciprocal undertaking with regard to propaganda should be in the same terms as that contained in article 16 of the general treaty of 1924, or whether that article was only quoted by way of example.The Secretary of State replied that it was the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to ask for an undertaking in the same terms as those used in the 1924 treaty.M. Dovgalevsky made no further comments on the memorandum, and it was agreed that a further meeting should be held on the 26th September to discuss the list of subjects handed-to him at the first meeting.Foreign Office, September 25, 1929.Annex.Memorandum of Procedure for the Settlement of Outstanding Questions to become operative immediately on the resumption of Full Diplomatic Relations between the two Governments, including the Exchange of Ambassadors.THE British Parliament reopens on the 29th October, and it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to present immediately a report giving the results of the negotiations on procedure, and, on the acceptance of this report by Parliament, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom for their part will be prepared to proceed to the resumption of full diplomatic relations.Propaganda.In their note of the 23rd July the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics undertook, on the resumption of diplomatic relations, to &quot; assume the rights and duties of States in diplomatic relations between themselves as soon as the British Government takes upon itself these rights and duties.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom propose that this shall be recorded by mutual pledges, to be made at the moment of the actual exchange of5.

Ambassadors, on the lines of article 16 of the general treaty of 1924, which ran as follows :         .&quot; The contracting parties solemnly affirm their desire and intention to live in peace and amity with each other, scrupulously to respect the undoubted right of a State to order its own life within its own jurisdiction in its own way, to refrain and to restrain all persons and organisations under their direct or indirect control, including organisations in receipt of any financial assistance from them, from any act overt or covert liable in any way whatsoever to endanger the tranquillity or prosperity of any part of the territory of the British Empire or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or intended to embitter the relations of the British Empire or the Union with their neighbours or any other countries.&apos;&apos;Diplomatic Missions and Consular Posts.(a.) The places at which consular posts shall be established in each country shall form the subject of discussion after the exchange of diplomatic missions. In the meantime, in order to facilitate trade between the two countries, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom suggest that facilities shall be afforded immediately on the resumption of diplomatic relations for the appointment of consuls in one or two of the more important places in each country, e.g., Leningrad.(&amp;.) Certain Soviet citizens formerly employed at the British mission in Moscow are believed to have been exiled on that ground alone. His Majesty&apos;s Government are confident that the Soviet Government will realise the deplorable effect which would be produced in the United Kingdom by the continued detention of any such persons when once diplomatic relations have been resumed, and will release them forthwith if their release has not already been effected.Debts.(A.) Inter-Governmental Debt and Claims including War Loan and Counter-claims (claims by the Soviet Government &quot;arising out of British inter-vention in Russia and financial relations between the Governments during the war).His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom suggest that, as provided in the general treaty of 1924, these claims shall be reserved for discussion at a later date.(B.)

Such a settlement should have regard to &apos;&apos; (a.) Its acceptance by a substantial proportion of the claimants affected; &quot; (b.) The financial and economic position of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics;&quot; (c.) The establishment of such financial and commercial relations between the twro countries as will secure an early development of mutual trade.&quot;Fisheries.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom suggest that an agreement shall be negotiated by nominated representatives of the two Governments on the lines
of that contained in the treaty of 1924. In the meantime, and simultaneously with the re-establishment of diplomatic relations, the provisional arrangement of 1923 shall be revived, by which the Soviet Government undertook to instruct its officials on the northern coast of the territory of the Union to refrain from interfering with British subjects in vessels without the 3-mile limit. -This provisional arrangement shall be put into force by an exchange of notes.Commercial Treaties and Allied Questions. :. this Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom suggest that the two Govern -ments shall nominate representatives with a view to the conclusion of a treaty of commerce and navigation.Application of Previous Treaties and Conventions.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom suggest that the two Govern-ments shall nominate representatives with a view to the examination of the application of previous treaties and conventions and the inclusion of clauses in relation thereto in the new general treaty.Trade Delegation^His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom propose that the general lines of the arrangement embodied in article 2 (1) of the commercial treaty of 1924 shall be followed, and that the head of the trade delegation (and, if so desired, his deputy) shall be members of the Embassy staff and enjoy the privileges and immunities appertaining to members of diplomatic missions generally. Among these immunities will be the inviolability of any rooms forming part of the premises of the trade delegation, which shall by mutual agreement be regarded as occupied solely by the head of the delegation or. his deputy.[N 4355/18/38] No. 4.Notes of Conversation between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and M. Dovgalevsky on September 26, 1929.M. DOVGALEVSKY said that he had studied the list of questions given to him by the Secretary of State on the 24th September, and handed Mr. Henderson a Tevised list (Annex A).The Secretary of State enquired why the first item on the British list, concerning propaganda, had been relegated to the fifth place on the Soviet list.M. Dovgalevsky said that, logically, the consideration of the treaties of 1924 should take the first place. The question of propaganda was not a new one and was not likely to raise new difficulties.The Secretary of State replied that, in that event, the question should be easily disposed of. In the original invitation to the Soviet Government the questions of propaganda and debts had been specially mentioned, and Parliament had been so informed. In view of the importance attached to the question of propaganda, this should be dealt with at the start.M. Dovgalevsky said that it was not desirable to bind the negotiators by formal rules of procedure. They would not be bound to deal with the various questions in the order in which they appeared on the list; that order was logical, but not chronological.The Secretary of State pointed out that, as he had. already indicated, it was the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to ask for a mutual undertaking regarding propaganda as given in 1924. There was no need to waste time over this question, but it should be clearly understood that the procedure included the giving of these guarantees at the time of the exchange of Ambassadors.After further discussion as to the order in which the subjects appeared on the Soviet list, M. Dovgalevsky said that he officially declared that when the list was agreed upon there would be no obligation to deal with the different questions in the order in which they appeared on that list. He was ready to put this guarantee in writing.   The Secretary of State repeated that there was to be no misunderstanding* N.B. This section was drafted later and was not included in the memorandum handed to M. Dovgalevsky.
as to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government; it was their intention to ask for the guarantee about propaganda at the moment of the exchange of Ambassadors.M. Dovgalevsky argued that it was logical that a decision should first be taken as to the attitude of the two Governments towards the 1924 treaties. If those treaties were not to be brought into force, a number of questions would have to be otherwise dealt with. If, on the other hand, they were brought into force, these questions would vpso facto be settled. A third possibility was that the repre-sentatives of the two Governments might think it desirable to bring into force parts of the treaties and to abandon other parts. The question of propaganda presented no new features, and there were other questions of more actual significance.The Secretary of State referred to the past history of the propaganda question, and pointed out that it was essential, if the exchange of Ambassadors was to be approved by Parliament, that the question of propaganda should be dealt with. This question and that of claims could not be relegated to a- later stage in the programme, and the procedure which M. Dovgalevsky apparently had in mind would not help in reaching a solution. It must be perfectly clearly understood that the question of propaganda was not to be left to discussion after the exchange of Ambassadors.M. Dovgalevsky maintained his point of view as to the order in which the questions should be put on the list, but repeated that those questions need not necessarily be examined by the delegates in the same order.The Secretary of State then suggested that the two lists should be left for the moment until it was possible to discuss the British memorandum on procedure. He asked whether M. Dovgalevsky could give him a memorandum showing his views on the procedure to be adopted for dealing with the questions enumerated in the Russian list. The British memorandum already indicated the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom as regards most of the questions mentioned on that list.M. Dovgalevsky said that he was not yet in a position to put forward a written statement, but that he was prepared to explain why the 1924 treaties had been inserted in the list, and, also, why the item which appeared in the British list as regards the arrangements for diplomatic missions, &amp;c, had been omitted.The Secretary of State pointed out that the question of the attitude of the two Governments towards the 1924 treaties could not possibly be described as a question of procedure, and M. Dovgalevsky explained that he aid not wish to discuss the merits of the question, but only to include it on the agenda for future negotiations.The Secretary of State pointed out that he had already given his views in writing, and must ask M. Dovgalevsky to do the same. He had only proposed to use the 1924 treaties for guidance in various points dealt with in the British memorandum.M. Dovgalevsky was not ready to give any opinion on the memorandum. He repeated that the negotiators might decide to use all, none, or part of the 1924 treaties. He wished to express no opinion on the subject, but the question was one which should be considered.The Secretary of State pointed out that if negotiations had taken place on the basis of the British list of subjects there was no reason why the negotiators of a new treaty should not have made use of the 1924 agreements, but this could be done without the attitude of the Governments being stated. He would look into the matter, but thought it really quite unnecessary. If the Russian or British negotiators wished to suggest making use of any parts of the old treaties, they could, of course, propose it. M. Dovgalevsky was unable to discuss the merits of the 1921 treaties, though, in his private opinion, they might be useful as a guide. The Secretary of State having expressed his readiness to lay down, if desired, that either side of the negotiators were at liberty to refer to the clauses of the 1924 treaties, M. Dovgalevsky objected to the idea of giving instructions to the delegates in any way, and repeated that they should be left at perfect liberty to deal with the 1921 treaties.The discussion was then adjourned until the afternoon.At the adjourned meeting the Secretary of State handed to M. Dovgalevsky a revisecHist of subjects to be dealt with (Annex B), in which a distinction had been made between the matters to be dealt with at the time of the exchange of Ambassadors and those to be subsequently dealt with.M. Dovgalevsky observed that he noticed that the question of propaganda had been replaced at the top of the list.
The Secretary of &quot;State explained that this question was one which it was essential to settle. He had consented to include in the list of matters to be dealt with, subsequently M. Dovgalevsky&apos;s proposal to consider the attitude of the Governments towards the 1924 treaties, but it was necessary to settle the.matters included in Group (A) before seeking the approval of the House of Commons to the resumption of relations.M. Dovgalevsky then said that he accepted Group (B) in the list as drafted. As regards Group (A), he proposed to discuss propaganda to-morrow, when the British memorandum on procedure was considered. He strongly objected, however, to the inclusion of item 2 in Group (A), i.e., the reference to arrangements in regard to diplomatic missions and consular posts and their staff. He asked the object of this reference. The Secretary of State read the passage in the memorandum referring to the arrest of Russian employees of the British mission. He regarded it as essential to secure proper treatment for persons who might be employed by British repre-sentatives in Russia, and was fully prepared to guarantee similar treatment to Soviet organisations in Great Britain.M. Dovgalevsky made a further objection that the phrase used was too wide,, and would give the impression that His Majesty&apos;s Government desired not to act in-accordance with the usual international practice. He added that any arrests of employees of the mission which might take place were cases affecting only Soviet citizens who had been dealt with in accordance with Soviet law and were not proper subjects for discussion with a foreign Government.The Secretary of State declined to recede from the position he had taken up in the matter,- and pointed out that it is impossible for British representatives to carry on their work under conditions which permit the groundless arrest of their employees.M. Dovgalevsky argued that the arrests took place after the departure of the mission, and that the persons arrested were thus not employed by the mission when taken into custody. After considerable further argument, in which M. Dovgalevsky showed himself most unsympathetic, he eventually undertook to inform his Govern-ment of the British attitude in the matter, but without making any recommendation.M. Dovgalevsky then raised numerous objections to the proposal to make arrangements for posts at which consuls were to be established, a subject which he-thought should be dealt with by personal negotiation after diplomatic relations had been established. After various attempts had been made to meet M. Dovgalevsky by redrafting this item on the agenda, the point was deferred for further consideration.As regards the proposed provisional arrangement respecting fisheries, M. Dovgalevsky argued that the British proposal entailed a definite decision, and that he was only authorised to deal with questions of precedure, and he was unwilling to put forward to his Government a proposal which they would certainly refuse to entertain. His Government had declared that they would not discuss the merits of any question until diplomatic relations were re-established, and there was no chance of their accepting even a proposal to revive the provisional arrangement which existed from 1923-27. M. Dovgalevsky remaining firm in this attitude, this question was also reserved for further consideration.Foreign Office, September 26, 1929.Annex A.Soviet Revised List of Questions.1.

[N 4445/18/38] No. 5.Notes of Conversation between- the Secretary of State and M. Dovgalevsky,September 27.M. DOVGALEVSKY enquired what was the position as regards the lists of questions discussed on the 26th September (see Annexes. A and B of notes of conversation of the 26th September).The Secretary of State explained that he now proposed to dispense with the classification of questions at issue into those to be dealt with on the resumption of diplomatic relations and those to be dealt with subsequently by special negotiators, and to combine them into one list, which would stand as follows : 1. Definition of the attitude of both Governments towards the treaties of 1924.2. Commercial treaty and allied questions.3. Debts, claims and counter-claims, inter-governmental and private, andfinancial questions connected with them. 4. Fisheries.5. Application of previous treaties and conventions.The Secretary of State then read to M. Dovgalevsky the draft of a note which might be addressed to him recording the results of the conversations. M. Dovgalevsky was, however, unwilling to agree to the terms of this note as drafted.The Secretary of State observed that agreement appeared to have been reached &amp;s regards the five questions to be subjects of negotiations, but that it was necessary to deal with the question of propaganda.M. Dovgalevsky suggested that this question should not appear on the list of subjects to be dealt with, but that in the report of the conversations it should be recorded that both parties Avere ready to confirm the undertaking given in 1924 immediately on the exchange of Ambassadors.The Secretary of State reminded M. Dovgalevsky that the proposal made in the memorandum handed to him w7as to repeat the undertaking of 1924. What objection could there be to stating in the record of the conversations the exact form of the mutual guarantee to be given ?Af fcer a long discussion as to the exact moment at which undertakings in regard to propaganda should be given, it was eventually agreed that the mutual pledges should be &quot; made immediately on the actual exchange of Ambassadors, and not later than the same day as that on which the respective Ambassadors present their credentials.&quot; It would be arranged that the date of presentation of credentials in Moscow and London should be identical.Annex B.British Revised List of Questions.(A.)

The Secretary of State, summing up this discussion, said that he understood that M. Dovgalevsky was willing to recommend to his Government to place the Secretary of State in a position to inform Parliament that there is to be an exchange of guarantees at the time of the exchange of Ambassadors. The form of the engage-ment remained to be agreed upon. M. Dovgalevsky said that he agreed to the list of questions to be dealt with as stated above, and that he also agreed to refer to his Government the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom with regard to propaganda, including the text of the undertaking proposed. It would still be necessary to record in a protocol the results of the conversations and to settle the procedure for dealing with the various questions enumerated in the list.The Secretary of State drew attention to the proposal which had been communi-cated to M. Dovgalevsky for the appointment of a joint committee to deal with claims, and laid stress on the advantages of dealing with this question in the manner proposed. He expressed the hope that M. Dovgalevsky would refer to his Govern-ment the question of principle involved, i.e., the proposal to refer the claims to a joint committee. M. Dovgalevsky undertook to prepare as soon as possible a draft protocol recording the results of the discussions, and a further meeting was fixed for the 1st October.Foreign Office, September 27, 1929.Draft Note read to M. Dovgalevsky on September 27.Your Excellency, September    ,19AS the result of the conversations which have taken place between us on the 24th, 25th, 26th and 27th September, it has been agreed that we should refer to our respective Governments the following list of questions to be the subject of negotiation immediately following the resumption of full diplomatic relations and the exchange of Ambassadors :  (1.) Definition of the attitude of both Governments towards the treaties of 1924. (2.) Commercial treaty and allied questions.(3.) Debts, claims and counter-claims, inter-governmental and private, andfinancial questions connected with them. (4.) Fisheries.(5.) Application of previous treaties and conventions.2. Your Excellency will have understood from the verbal declarations I have made to you that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are prepared to enter into a mutual engagement regarding propaganda. The Government of the U.S.S.R. in their note of the 23rd July undertook on their side on the resumption of diplomatic relations to &apos;&apos; assume the rights and duties of States and diplomatic relations between themselves as soon as the British Government takes upon itself those rights and duties.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom propose that this undertaking shall be recorded by mutual pledges to be made at the moment of the actual exchange of Ambassadors, on the lines of article 16 of the General Treaty of 1924, which ran as follows : &quot; The contracting parties solemnly affirm their desire and intention to live in peace and amity with each other, scrupulously to respect the undoubted right of a State to order its own life within its own jurisdiction in its own way, to refrain and to restrain all persons and organisations under their direct or indirect control, including organisations in receipt of any financial assistance from them, from any act overt or. covert liable in any way whatsoever to endanger the tranquillity or prosperity of any part of the territory of the British Empire or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or intended to embitter the relations of the British Empire or the Union with their neighbours or any other countries.&quot; :3. As regards the question of debts, claims and counter-claims, inter-governmental and private, and financial questions connected with them, I have indicated to your Excellency that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom propose that the inter-governmental debt and claims, including war loan and counter-claims (claims by the Soviet Government arising out of British intervention in Russia and financial relations between the Governments during the war) should, as
provided in the general treaty of 1924, be reserved for discussion at a.later date. His Majesty&apos;s Government further propose that all the remaining classes of claims and counter-claims shall be referred to a joint committee consisting of not less than five and not more than seven representatives of each Government, to be freely selected from their own nationals, whether officials or non-officials. The classes of claims to be dealt with by this joint committee would be as follows : (A.) Claims of British holders of Russian pre-revolution bonded governmentaland municipal debt. (B.) Claims by British companies and nationals in respect of nationalisedproperties and concessions. (C.) Miscellaneous claims (including shares in Russian companies, personalinjuries, debts due from Russian firms, money confiscated, moveable andimmoveable property, and corresponding Soviet claims).The joint committee shall, it is suggested, be appointed, with the following terms of reference : &quot; To examine the problems arising out of the claims under (A), (B) and (C) set out above, with a view to recommending to the two Governments an equitable settlement of such problems for incorporation in a later treaty between the two Governments.   Such a settlement should have regard to &quot; (a.) Its acceptance by a substantial proportion of the claimants affected. &quot; (b.) The financial and economic position of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.&quot; (c.) The establishment of such financial and commercial relations between the two countries as will secure an early development of mutual trade.&quot;4. As I have already stated to your Excellency, Parliament will reassemble on the 29th October, and it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government then to present for parliamentary approval a report of our conversations. His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to be able to inform Parliament on this occasion that the Govern-ment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, on their side, are prepared to enter into a mutual engagement regarding propaganda, on the lines indicated above, simultaneously with the exchange of Ambassadors, and also that the Soviet Govern-ment are prepared to deal with the question of claims and counter-claims in the manner proposed. On parliamentary approval being obtained for the report to be presented, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, for their part, will be prepared to proceed to the resumption of full diplomatic relations and the appointment of an Ambassador in Moscow.]N 4441/18/38] No. 6.Notes of Conversation between the Secretary of State and M. Dovgalevsky,held at Lewes, October 1. 1929.M. DOVGALEVSKY referred to the classification of the questions to be dealt with as described in the list discussed at the meeting of the 27th September. He pressed that the word &quot;debts&quot; should not be used, as the definition &quot;claims and counter-claims, inter-governmental and private&quot; would cover all classes of claims. He stated, however, that in suggesting the omission of the word &quot; debts &quot; the Soviet Government did not desire to avoid the discussion of any aspect of the question.The Secretary of State declined to agree to the removal of the wrord &apos;&apos; debts,&apos; and it was eventually decided to retain it.M. Dpvgalevsky stated that the Soviet Government were prepared to agree to the proposed procedure as regards the mutual guarantee respecting propaganda.The Secretary of State welcomed this declaration, but said that he desired that there should be no misunderstanding as to the attitude of His Majesty s Government. They regarded the- wording of article 16 of the treaty of 1924 as covering propaganda by the Third International, and he desired that M. Dovgalevsky should make this quite clear to his Government.
M. Dovgalevsky said that he had no authority to discuss the interpretation placed by the Soviet Government on this article. He could only say that his Government would loyally carry out any obligations entered into. The Secretary of State repeated that this was a matter to which great importance was attached not only in the United Kingdom, but in other parts of the British Empire, and that there must therefore be no misunderstanding. His Majesty&apos;s Government, regarded the article as applicable to propaganda by the Third Inter-national, and they would act upon this interpretation of the guarantee to be given.M. Dovgalevsky then produced a revised draft of a protocol recording the results of the conversations, and the remainder of the meeting was occupied with the discussion and revision of this draft.[N 4466/18/38] No. 7.Protocol Relative to&apos;the Procedure for the Settlement of Questions outstanding between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, such Procedure to become Operative immediately on the Resumption of full Diplomatic Relations between the two States, including the Exchange of Ambassadors.aTHE undersigned, the Eight Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P., His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State&apos; for Foreign Affairs, and M.
