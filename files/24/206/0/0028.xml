COPY NOMi^ORlNpuM BY THlii MINIVER OF LABOUR. iCRJJi.P.  79(29).1, ^ince I took up ray present duties I have been giving close attention to the Unemployment Insurance Scheme.    The changes which can be made by administrative action are necessarily of a limited character, and 1 ne;,d not deal with this here beyond saying that I have made a number of suoh-changes and shall make others as I become satisfied that they are necessary.   What I am concerned with in this memorandum are the more important changes, which require legislation and for which I ask for the support of my colleagues. 2. Five major changes which many of our supporters will press for are:(1) the abolition Q.f the &quot;genuinely seeking work&quot; requirement and of &quot;suspension of benefit&quot;;(2) lowering the age of entry into insurance bwlow 16;(3) the insurance of agricultural workers;(4) a general increase in the rates of benefit; and(5) a reduction of the 6 days&quot; &quot;waiting period&quot; or its abolition altogether.3. She first point (&quot;genuinely seeking work&quot;) is discussed&amp;t some length in my separate memorandum on the Morris committee report (0.P.282(29)).       What I propose to do is to repeal thecondition &quot;genuinely se-king work and unable to obtain suitable employment^ and to substitute other provisions.     The wording of the new provisions will have to be carefully considered, butbroadly their effect will be that:-/ (a)
(a) except where he has refused a specific job of a suitable kind, the claimant in this class of case should! not lose his benefit unless it is first established to the satisfaction of the Court of Referees (subject of&quot;course to the usual rights of appeal to the Umpire) that rI1-.there has been work available which was suitable for him;(b) a claimant is not relieved from the obligation of looking for work for himself, but he will only be disqualified on account of not doing so if the Court of Referees is satisfied that opportunities of work existed which he might reasonably have been expected to follow up;(c) a claimant must be allowed a reasonable time in which to j find work in his own trade, and must not be required to   if look for work outside his trade unless he has first had written notice from the Insurance Officer that he is required to extend his search for work as mentioned in the notice;(d) on receiving such notice, the claimant may appeal against I it to the Court of Referees.4.     Closely connected with this question is that of the suspension::jrof benefit in cases when the right to continue on benefit has tobe challenged.     She subject is dealt with in paragraph (9) of the   memo.O*P, 82(29)    on the Morris Report.      In cases where aIspecific job is refused, it would clearly be wrong to continue to pay benefit, pending a deoision by the Court, except for the period prior to the date of the refusal..    But apart from cases of that kind, I propose to make provision for the continued payment of benefit up to the date of decision by the Court of Referees, when the point at issue is whether the claimant is making reasonable efforts to obtain work and in certain other cases of a similar .kind,  e.g. whether there has been a reasonable period of employment in the past two years.
5. I have referred-the question oi  lowering the age of entry Into unemployment Insurance to the National Juvenile Advisory Councils for   mglancl and Scotland for their consideration and advice.      I have not yat received their reports but I have reason to anticipate that they will support the lowering of the age.      If this proves not to be the case I shall have to consider the matter again.     Subject to this,&apos; I propose to lower the sga of entry Into Insurance to the new school leaving age and to pay the same benefit rates to those under 16 as to those aged 16 years (namely 6/-and 5/-),     The Initial step will be to bring the age of entry Into insurance Into line with the higher school leaving age when that takes effect in April, 1951.      The Clause will be drafted so that the age of entry into Insurance will rise with any subsequent raising of the school leaving age without the necessity for further unemployment insurance legislation.      I propose that the contributions to be paid in respect of the boys and girls under 16 shall be the same as the contributions payable in respect of boys and girls aged 16 and 17, viz.., 7-(id a week for boys of which the employers will pa-y 4d. and 6^d a week for girls of which the employer will pay 5fjd.      It is estimated that there will be an excess of Income over expenditure for this age group taken by itself of about  400,000 a year.6. The insurance of agricultural workers againstunemployment presents great difficulties both of policy and administrative detail.      I am consulting with the Minister of Agriculture on the subject and the matter is being examined inter-departmentally.      It must take some time to decide upon the right course and the Minister of Agriculture agrees with, me that It Is not possible to arrive at a conclusion In time for the present Bill.
7. As regards the fourth and fifth points (increasing ratesof benefit and modifying the waiting period), I will first of all indicate the approximate cost of various changes which might be made .8.      x with regard to rates of benefit, the extra annual cost for overy ls.Od. increase, would be approximately as follows: Adult,  (now 17/- for men and 15/- for 2,000,000women.)Adult dependant (now 7/-)    ...... 825,000Child (now 2/-) ....... 1,350,000If, therefore, we increased the weekly rates of benefit to those proposed, for example, by the Trade Union Congress in their evidence to the Blanesburgh -Committee, namely, 2o/- for a man, 18/- for a woman, 10/- for an adult dependant and 5/- for each dependant child, the extra cost would be  12,500,000 per annum.9. As regards the waiting period, the cost of reducing it to3 days would be about  2,000,000 per annum.     The cost of leaving it at 6 days, but paying benefit from the first day if the 6 dayj are satisfied would be about  3,000,000 &quot;per annum.      But the amounts take no account of the effect oi the changes in bringing in persons who now, owing to their short periods of Unemployment, do not trouble to register and the estimates would probably be materially exceeded in actual practice. 10.        Fow the plain fact is that the Unemployment Fund has no money with which to meet new charges.    It was practically in a bankrupt condition when we took Office and. in order to ensure the continued payment of  benefit we have already taken two steps : (a)     With the approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer In July, 1929,  3,500,000 was added to the annual revenue of the Fund by making the Exchequer contribution equal to one half of the combined contribution of employers and employed;(b)    It has been agrBed that the Exchequer shall bear thecost of the extension of the transitional period referred/to
1 u sto below - para,15 - an extension which, is quite *     unavoidable in present circumstances and must take precedence of any other new charge.     This will relieve the Fund to the extent of  (say)  3,000,000 in the next financial year and double that sum in each succeeding year if the transitional terms are further continued at the expense of the Ixchequer. 11, These two additions to the resources of the fund will cost the   exchequer next year (say)  6,500,000 and in succeeding years (say)  9,500,000;    this together with the previous contribution, which amounts to about  12,500,000 will make the total annual exchequer contribution for Unemployment Insurance  22,000,000.       Large as are the additions made, it is by no means certain that the total revenue will be sufficient to enable the Fund to continue to meet charges now existing and I am considering with the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether and to what extent additional money must be provided for this purpose. 12. It is clear, therefore, that the Funa is withoutthe resources to meet any additional charges.      if, as I assume, ray colleagues agree that the changes in the genuinely seeking work condition and suspension of benefit proposed above - paras. 5 and 4 - must-be made I shall have to take account of the quite substantial cost they will involve in my further discussions with the Chancellor./It
It would be folly to finance additional benefits out of further borrowings for It would seem openly to be incurring a bad debt, nor can further money be got by increasing the contributions of employers and workers.     As will be seen below, I am making certain proposals involving extra cfcst, e.g. (para.13) increases in the rates of benefit for persons below the age of 21j    but my proposals for reducing the age of entry into Insurance will provide as from April 1931 seme small margin of revenue which may on balance offset the cost of the improvements which I propose in para, 13. Apart from these proposals I feel compelled to advise against an increase of the rates of benefit or an alteration of the waiting period, although I should have been more than glad if money could have been found for reducing the waiting period to 3 days;    but I want my colleagues carefully to consider the matter, for it is certain that we shall be strongly criticised by our own supporters.
-ISO o o13. I propose to Improve the benefit scales ofpersons aged 17, 18 and 19.    Prior to the Act of 1927 claimants aged 18 and over drew the full adult rates. The rates no?/ operative in their case are the result of a reduction made by that Act in accordance with the recommendation of the Blanesburgh Committee, and reductions were- also made to the rates for persons aged 16 and 17.   The justification for the reduction was largely that some form of training ought to be provided for unemployed claimants of these ages in addition to their benefit.    It is clear that although I shall do everything in my power to increase the facilities for training it will not be possible to guarantee such facilities in all cases and I think therefore that the reductions in benefit should be reconsidered.    On the other hand I do not think it would be right to go back completely to the previous system of paying the full rate of benefit to all cases at age. 18; one serious objection to this is the large rise in the rate made in one step at that age and it is much better to have intermediate rates. My proposals level up the rates at ages 18 and 19 to those now payable at age 20 and increase by 50$ to rate at age 17.
1 G0Jfc t/ U14. The resulting rates of benefit,togetherwith those now   -operative, are shown in the following Table in which I hare included the rates for all persons Aged 15 to 20:-Male s. Females.Present     Proposed       Present      Proposed Hate, Rate .&quot; Rate .  ^ih.1Age 15                            - 6s,                 -               5s.Age 16                            6s. 6s.                 5s. 5s.Agft 17                            6s. 9s,                 5s.            7s. 6d,Age 13 10s. 14s.                8s. 12s.Age 19 12s. 14s. 10s. 12s.Age 20 14s. 14So 12s, 12s.At the age of 21 the adult rates of 17s. and 15s. respeotively become payable.      Claimants aged 18, 19 and   20 who receive additional benefit for a dependant already receive the full adult rates cf benefit.The cost of the improvements for ages 17, 18 and 19, will be about  370,000 per annum.
1 (M15.    I have examined the need for making ohanges in the classes of dependants eligible for allowances.     At present these allowances are paid, breadly speaking for wives, invalid husbands, widowed mothers living with the olaimant, house-keepers residing with the olaimant and having the care of his or her dependent children, and for dependent children. The Blanesburgh Committee gave very careful consideration to the whole question and the existing law embodies all their recommendations.     There are, however, one or two anomalies and I propose to make minor amendments in order to remedy them,16,    In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet (Cabinet 37(29) Conclusion 2) and pending the exploration of the general question of making the maintenance of the able-bodied unemployed a naVipnal charge, the transitional period will be extended for one year.     This will mean that those claimants for benefit who have not paid 30 contributions in the last two years will not be cut off as from next April but will run on at least until April, 1931.     As already stated, this will cost the Exchequer (say)  3 millions in the financial year 1930-31,17.   I regard it as important to develop largely the activities of the Ministry in the direction of providing or assisting training schemes and making arrangements of various kinds which are designed to help workers to get a new footing in industry.     The Ministry of Labour for some time past has been developing a system of industrial training, and of paying or advancing removal.expenses of workers.     These arrangements are not covered by any general statutory power to engage in these activities or to incur the consequent expense.     The Treasury have since 1928 been pressing the Ministry to regularise the position constitutionally by obtaining a general statutory power, and I am considering whether or not to include an appropriate clause in this Bill./Obviously
Obviously to do so would widen the field of attack and for this reason I should prefer not to include such a clause in this Bill unless it is really unavoidable, 18.   There are other points which I propose to include in the Bill, but as they do not raise any point of considerable political importance I need not bring them before my colleagues at this stage.     They will oome before the Cabinet in due course when the draft Bill is circulated. 19e   To sum up, I propose, apart from minor amendments:-(1)    To abolish the &quot;genuinely seeking work&quot; condition andto make other provisions as indicated in paragraph 3 &apos; ,   above.(2)   To abolish the praotioe of suspending benefit pending a decision of the Statutory Authorities in cases in which the question at issue is the general one whether the applicant is making reasonable efforts to obtain work, and in certain other oases of a similar kind (paragraph 4).(3)    [Subject to the reports of the National Juvenile Advisory Councils, to lower the ago of entry into Insurance to the new school leaving age as from April, 1931, when the higher school leaving age takes effect.   The contribu-tions and benefits to be the same as those now applying to boys and girls aged 16. (paragraph 5).(4)   Not to include the insurance of agricultural workers in the present Bill.    (paragraph 6).(5)   To provide increased rates of benefit for persons of both sexes aged 17, 18 and 19, but otherwise to make no changes in the rates of benefit,  (paragraph 13).(6)   To make certain minor extensions in the classes of dependants eligible for allowances.    (paragraph 15).(7)   To make no change in the present &quot;waiting period&quot; of six days.    (paragraph 12j.
(8)    To extend the transitional period for one year as already decided by the Cabinet, the cost of theextension to be met by the Exohequer.(paragraph 16). (9j   To consider the inclusion of a clause givinggeneral authority to provide training and removalexpenses,  (paragraph 17). 20.   These proposals are important and will go far to enable me to meet the cribicismy&apos;about the administra-tion of the scheme.     Other changes (for example, higher rates of benefit and the three day waiting period) which some of our supporters would like - and I would like - to introduce cannot be made in the absence of more favourable finance.     They must in any case be looked at as part of our general social insurance policy which, as the Cabinet are aware, is being examined by the Committee recently appointed.(Intd, ) M, CBo
