[This^ Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;&amp; Government. ]printed for the Cabinet.   October 1929,CONFIDENTIAL.Copy No.31CP. 284 (29).CABINET.I circulate to my colleagues the proof of a Command Paper containing (1) the text of the correspondence with the Soviet Government, leading to my conversations with M. Dovgalevski (including an official communique of August 2), and (2) the text of the Protocol of October 3.At the Cabinet meeting of Monday, October 7, we decided to publish the Protocol only, but this decision had special reference to the collection of documents contained in CP. 267 (29), that is to say, the records of my conversations with M. Dovgalevski in September.This Command Paper (which was already in course of preparation when the Cabinet decision was taken) contains, as it stands, the whole of the correspondence with the Soviet Government, all of which has been made public at one time or another. Parliament and the public do not realise this, however, and, in my opinion, it might be preferable to lay the whole of this correspondence on our own initiative, and thereby anticipate and possibly stifle criticism, rather than to publish the Protocol alone, and then produce or refer to the other documents when pressed to do so, a course which might give the impression that some of the correspondence was being suppressed.There is no question of laying the records of my conversations with M. Dovgalevski.A. H.Foreign Office, October 18, 1929.5072   [20007a]

Correspondence regarding the Resumption of Relations with the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.No. 1.Text of Communication from His Majesty&apos;s Government in I he-United Kingdom to the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics transmitted through the Norwegian Minister in Moscow on July 15, 1929.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have care-fully considered the existing state of the relations between this country and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and are prepared to re-establish the normal machinery of diplomatic relations between Great Britain and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, on the understanding that the reciprocal rights and duties which inter-national law recognises as incumbent on States in their relations with one another subsist between this country and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. &apos;To this end His Majesty&apos;s Government invite the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to send a responsible representative to London in order to discuss with the Foreign Secretary direct the most expeditious procedure for reaching as rapidly as possible a friendly and mutually satisfactory settlement of the outstanding questions between the two countries, including those relating to propaganda and debts.No. 2.Translation of Communication from the Soviet Government received through the Norwegian Minister in Moscow and dated July 23, 1929.The Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics note the communication from the British Government that they are willing to re-establish diplomatic relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the interruption of which was not the conse-quence of the fault or desire of the Government of the Union. The Government of the Union welcome this proposal in the interest ot both countries and of the cause of peace. The Government of the Union consider it necessary that there shall be established as soon as possible a lasting agreement regarding disputed questions, and believe that such a lasting agreement can only be attained throng)) both parties being treated as having equal rights and by the main-tenanee of reciprocal dignity and esteem.5072 wt. - 60 10/29 F.O.P. 20007
The Government will assume the rights and duties of States in diplomatic relations between themselves as soon as the British Government takes upon itself these rights and duties.In view of.the fact that the note from the British Government aims at a preliminary exchange of views exclusively regarding the procedure to be followed in the Subsequent discussion of disputed questions and not at an actual discussion of these questions, and being of the opinion that these deliberations regarding procedure can be concluded in the course of a very short period, the Government are requesting M. Dovgalevski, plenipotentiary repre-sentative of the Union in France, to journey to London for this purpose.No. 3.Translation of Note handed by M. Dovgalevski io the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on July 31, 1929.The Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have done everything on their side to facilitate the rapprochement between the Union and Great Britain and the resumption of normal diplo-matic relations between the two countries.   The fact, however, that the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has stated to M. Dovgalevski, the Soviet Ambassador to France, that it is impos-sible for the British Government to re-establish normal relations between the two countries before the solution of the questions out-standing between them, shows that the British Government do not desire or are unable to bring about the resumption of these relations. If such were not the case, the British Governemnt would not have proposed, as a preliminary condition for the re-establishment of normal relations, the solution of questions so complicated and con-tentious as the mutual claims and counter-claims.     This new circumstance, which was not foreshadowed by the note from the British Government addressed to the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs on the 17th July, requires a fresh examination of the question.   For that reason the People&apos;s ,Commissariat for Foreign Affairs finds itself compelled to ask for fresh instructions from the Praesidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Union, which will consider the new proposals of the British Government at its next plenary session.No. 4.Foreign Office Communique of August 2, 1929.The conversations between Mr. Henderson and M. Dovgalevski, which began on the 29th July, were resumed yesterday evening. M. Dovgalevski returned to Paris this morning, and the conversa-(ions will not be continued for the present.In his original invitation Mr. Henderson made it clear that it was the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government to resume regular
relations with the Government of the Soviet &quot;Union, and that a responsible representative of the latter would be welcomed with a view to discussing the most expeditious procedure for the settie-menfc of outstanding questions, including debts and propaganda. Though the reply of the Soviet Union to this invitation was some-what ambiguous, it was presumed that in offering to send M. Dovgalevski to London the Soviet Union had authorised him to discuss the procedure for settling outstanding questions on the lines proposed by Mr. Henderson.In their first interview Mr. Henderson explained to M. Dovgalevski the lines on which His Majesty&apos;s Government wished to proceed, that he was anxious to avail himself of the present parliamentary recess in order to set up the necessary machinery for dealing with such outstanding questions as debts, claims, trade, &amp;c. He felt sure that, with goodwill on both sides, sufficient progress might be made to enable him on the reassembling of Parliament in October to report what had been achieved, that the principles on which a settlement could be worked out had been defined, and to request authority, even if complete settlements of all outstanding questions had not been reached, for the exchange of fully accredited Ambassadors between the two countries.M. Dovgalevski, on instructions from his Government, replied that in the view of his Government the best method of proceeding was the immediate exchange of Ambassadors, that the Government of the Soviet Union could not at present accept Mr. Henderson&apos;s proposals, and would have to refer them to the next session of the Praesidium of the Central Executive Committee.His Majesty&apos;s Government adhere to their desire to resume normal relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and take note that the Praesidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union will consider the new proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government at their next session.No. 5.Statement made by the Secretary of State at Geneva on September 4, 1929.The actual resumption of relations cannot take place until a report has been made to Parliament.In the meantime, there is plenty of work to be done, and the interval between now and the opening of Parliament could still usefully be occupied in arranging the procedure and programme for the subsequent negotiations, which I hope will lead to the settle-ment of the outstanding questions between the two countries.The desire of the British Government is to re-establish relations as soon as possible on a friendly and stable basis, and the invitation
to the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to send a responsible representative to London in order to discuss the most expeditious procedure still stands.No. 6.Statement made by M. Litvinov on September 6, 1929.The point of view of the Soviet Government on the question of resumption of normal diplomatic relations between Britain and Russia is quite clear and well known. It was precisely stated by M. Piatakov on the 5th April last on the order of the Soviet Government to the British Trade Delegation, which visited the Soviet Union whilst the Conservative Government was in office. The same point of view was expressed in the note from Soviet Government, dated the 23rd July last, which was handed to the British Government through the Norwegian Charge d&apos;Affaires at Moscow. This note expressed the readiness of the Soviet Govern-ment to discuss the procedure of negotiations on the question of differences between the two countries, which negotiations were to take place after the complete restoration of normal diplomatic relations.If the declaration of the British Foreign Secretary is to be understood in the sense that he desires again to meet a repre-sentative of the Soviet Government to discuss only procedure  into which will naturally enter formation of the agenda of future negotiations no objection will be made on the part of the Soviet Government. The Soviet Government is ready to take corresponding steps as soon as the British Government states the place and the time of negotiations on procedure.No. 7.Text of Communication from His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, transmitted through the Norwegian Minister in Moscow, September 8, 1929.His Majesty&apos;s Government have taken note of the statement made by M. Litvinov in Moscow on the 6th September on the subject of the re-establishment of relations between the British and Soviet Governments, and as that has always been the purpose of His Majesty&apos;s Government would suggest that Tuesday, the 24th September, in London would be convenient date and place for the Foreign Secretary to meet Soviet representatives for the purpose of these negotiations on procedure. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would be glad to learn in due course the port and time of arrival of Soviet representatives in England.
No. 8.Translation of Communication from M. Litvinov received through the Norwegian Minister in Moscow and dated September 12, 1929.The Soviet Government have noted for their guidance a communication from the British Government in which, with reference to my statement of the 6th instant, they invite the Soviet Government again to send a plenipotentiary to London on the 24th September for the discussion with the Foreign Minister of the question of the method of procedure. In accordance with the above-mentioned statement and their note of the 23rd July in which is stated the Soviet Governments willingness to discuss, for the time being, only the question of the method of procedure at succeeding negotiations and not questions under dispute, the Soviet Government agree to send to London on the stated day a repre-sentative with the necessary powers. The exact time and English port of arrival of the Soviet Government representative will be stated later.No. 9.Protocol Relative to the Procedure for the Settlement of Questions outstanding between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, such Procedure to become Operative immediately on the Resumption of full Diplomatic Relations beUueen the two States, including the Exchange of Ambassadors.The undersigned, the Right Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P., His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and M. Valerian Dovgalevsky, Ambassador of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the French Republic, having, on instructions from their respective Governments, entered into an exchange of views on questions connected with the above-mentioned subject, have reached the following agreement: 1.

The aforesaid negotiations shall be conducted on behalf of the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics by the Soviet Ambassador in London, and on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom by His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.4. The plenipotentiaries of the two Governments shall, if neces-sary, be assisted by joint committees, the members of which shall be appointed in equal number by each Government from among their nationals, whether officials or not, specially acquainted with the matters under discussion.5. These experts shall report to each of the plenipotentiaries on the results reached in their joint examination of the respective questions and on the solution thereof which they suggest.6. All agreements resulting from the negotiations between the plenipotentiaries shall take the form of a treaty or treaties between the two Governments.7. Immediately on the actual exchange of Ambassadors, and not later than the same day as that on which the respective Ambassadors present their credentials, both Governments wil reciprocally confirm the pledge with regard to propaganda contained in article 16 of the treaty signed on the 8th August, 1924, between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.8. Simultaneously with the approval by both Governments of the procedure laid down in paragraphs 1-7, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will take the decision to resume normal diplomatic relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, including the exchange of Ambassadors.9. The steps to be taken, as set out in the preceding paragraphs, including the decision concerning the re-establishment of diplomatic relations, will be brought for approval before Parliament early at the beginning of the next session.

DOVGALEVSKY.London, October 3, 1929.
