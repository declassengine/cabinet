[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1929.SECRET.CP. 307 (29).CABINET.Narrative of events leading up to the publication of the letters between Sir J. Simon and the Prime Minister, and of the Viceroy&apos;s Statement.On the 13th July Lord Irwin arrived ih England. He brought with him certain documents containing proposals which he had thought out in conjunction with some of his official advisers in India and discussed in some degree informally with the Chairman and other members of the Statutory Commission in India, with a view to anticipating a possible boycott of the Statutory Commission^ Report when made, which might be anticipated as a sequel to the boycott of the Commission during its inquiry in India.The documents included drafts of imaginary letters to be exchanged between the Chairman of the Statutory Commission and the Prime Minister which had been prepared in India after the Statutory Commission returned to England the imaginary letters if brought into being to be exchanged about the end of July. In these drafts the suggested letter from Sir John Simon to the Prime Minister drew attention to the necessity of the Commission taking cognisance of the Butler Report and dealing in its own Report with the relations between British India and the States. The draft letter suggested as a corollary to this the desirability of setting up a tripartite conference in which His Majesty&apos;s Government would meet both representatives of British India and representatives of the States, not necessarily always together, for the purpose of exchanging views and seeking the greatest possible measure of agreement for the final proposals which it would later be the duty of His Majesty&apos;s Government to submit to Parliament. In this draft it was proposed that the conference should take place with representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government at a point when they had only framed provisional conclusions, and that such provisional conclusions should form the subject-matter for discussion. Lord Irwin understood that the members (except Lord Burnham, who was ill. and therefore not consulted) generally were disposed to favour this plan and its embodiment in a letter. In the suggested reply from the Prime Minister to Sir John Simon (not discussed with any members of the Commission) approval was to be given of the Statutory Corn-mission^ hypothetical suggestion of an extended scope for their Report (which in the draft letter was incorrectly described as an extension of their terms of reference), and of a revision of the later procedure &quot; by the adoption of such procedure as shall permit the most free interchange of opinions and ideas by all concerned, and to this end after His Majesty&apos;s Government, in consultation with the Government of India, have been able to examine this question in the light of all the material then available, they will accordingly propose to invite representatives of British India and of the Indian States to meet them for the purpose of such discussion.&quot; The Prime Ministers suggested reply was also to include a passage of some length pointing out, d propos of the inclusion within the scope of the Commission^ Report of the future relationship of British India with the States, a definition of the policy which, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, was implied in the Declaration of August 1917. The opportunity was to be taken of disposing of the doubts which had been expressed both in England and in India regarding the interpretation which is to be placed on the intentions of the British Government in enacting the Statute of 1919. The definite pronouncement was suggested that &quot; it is the definite policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government that India shall, thrcmgh the realisation of responsible government, be enabled to obtain in due season recognition as a self-governing Dominion.&quot;Informal discussions on the subject-matter of these draft letters took place between Lord Irwin and the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for India immediately after his arrival.It appears that Lord Irwin mentioned it also to Lord Reading, who, at that stage at any rate, expressed no objection.4037      100   11.29A
On the 18th July Sir John Simon saw Lord Irwin and the Secretary of State at ,the India Office and the same day circulated to his colleagues a minute, of which he communicated a copy to the Secretary of State, in which he laid before them proposals, in the shape of a skeleton draft letter to the Prime Minister, to take into the scope of the Commission^ Report the question of the relationship of British India with the States, and as a consequence to suggest to His Majesty&apos;s Government the setting up of a conference to consider draft, constitutional proposals put before it by the Government, in which conference His Majesty&apos;s Government would meet both representatives of British India and representatives of the States, not necessarily always together, for the purpose of exchanging views atid seeking the greatest possible measure of agreement for the final proposals which it would later be the duty of His Majesty&apos;s Government to submit to Parliament. In his minute to the Commission, Sir John Simon added, &quot;I understand that the Prime Minister, before replying to our letter, would take into consultation the leaders of the other Parties so that, if our proposals are approved, they will be approved as the result of agreement between all parties.   This seems to me important.&quot;On the 25th July Lord Irwin made a statement to the Cabinet. The Cabinet&apos;s conclusion was in favour of the proposal of the Governor-General &quot;that at an early date there should be an interchange of letters between the Chairman of the Statutory Commission and the Prime Minister, in the course of which the latter should make clear (J) that Dominion status was the ultimate aim of the Governments policy whioh they were trying to help the peoples of India to achieve by stages; (2) that the Government intended, after receipt of the Simon Commission^ Report to formally draft proposals for examination by a conference in London which representatives of different shades of opinion in India would be invited to attend.&quot;Following this decision, further informal discussions took place between Lord Irwin, the Secretary of State for India, and Sir John Simon, to consider the terms of the suggested letters to be exchanged between the latter and the Prime Minister. Sir John Simon now wishes it, to be understood- that he took part in these discussions in a provisional manner only, that is to say, he was concerned as a consultant in the terms of the letters, but was not committed to concurrence in them without the approval of his Commission, before which he was to lay the final drafts. Sir John Simon&apos;s position further w*as limited by the necessity as a prior condition to the exchange of the letters of obtaining the concurrence of the leaders of the other Parliamentary Parties. The inclusion in the first paragraph of the draft of the Prime Ministers reply of the words &quot; I have thought right before answering it to consult the leaders of other Parties. I have now been able to ascertain their views and they have been good enough to concur in the terms of my reply,&quot; was, it now appears, in Sir John Simon&apos;s view the proof that the concurrence of the other political Parties in the proposals embodied in the suggested correspondence was a prior condition to the submission of the correspondence to the Statutory Commission for its approval. It was on this basis that, as he has now made clear, Sir John Simon took part in the discussions of the drafts, which, as they stood after a meeting held on the 27th July, were telegraphed to the acting Governor-General for an expression of his views as to their suitability for the purpose held in view. (Lord Goschen was also consulted as to the most appropriate date for the exchange and publication of the letters. Lord Goschen on the 19th September was in favour of postponement of publication till Lord IrwhVs return to India;)On the 33 st July the draft letters as they stood on the 27th July were communi-cated to the Prime Minister who took them with him to Lossiemouth. On the 12th August the Prime Minister replied, suggesting certain alterations in his reply to Sir John, and sent the following covering note : &quot;The Prime Minister is willing to sign this letter provided he is advised that it will really improve the position. If it does not, it will only make matters worse. I gathered from Lord Irwin that it would make a difference. A final draft for me to sign should be prepared, provided the Secretary of State still thinks that it will be effective.&quot; On the 14th August the Prime Ministers alterations and covering minute were referred to Lord Irwin. On the 15th August Lord Irwin replied. He made certain counter-suggestions and proposed that Sir John Simon should see the proposed amendments &quot; as he was a party to the first part and is the prime mover in the business.&quot; At this time the Prime Minister, Lord Irwin, the Secretary of State, and Sir John Simon were all out of London. No further discussion appears to have taken place till the end of August. On the 4th September a conversation took place between Lord Irwin and the Secretary of State in the light of the Prime Ministers doubts as to the efficacy of the drafts put
&quot;before him at the end of July. Summarising the conversation in a letter of the 9th September, Lord Irwin suggested that &quot;we should stick to the plan already laid down with, if you so desire, such amendment of the Prime Ministers letter as may be required (a) to make the declaration about Dominion status more explicit and (6) to emphasise the freedom of the conference.&quot; The suggested amendment of the passage about Dominion status was inspired by comments received from Lord Irwin&apos;s advisers in India. In regard to the second suggestion it was realised that there might be some difficulty with Sir John Simon who had earlier insisted on the point that the proposed conference should only take place after Government bad formulated its proposals in the light of the Simon Commission Report.This second point of holding a conference to consider questions at issue before the formulation by Government of any proposals was put to Sir John Simon by the Secretary of State on the 15th September as the latter&apos;s own proposal. Sir John Simon thought he would find it difficult to get the concurrence of members of the Commission. The same day the Secretary of State saw the Prime Minister and discussed the position with him, and the proposal was examined (though not actually pursued) of dividing the suggested announcement into two parts, allotting to Sir John Simon the declaration about Dominion status and making the announcement about the conference separately. Following on this, a meeting was convened between.Lord Irwin, Sir John Simon, the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State on Thursday, 19th September. At this conference it was arranged to proceed with an exchange of letters between Sir John Simon and the Prime Minister, the former to point out the, desirability of giving such possibly extended interpretation to the Commission^ terms of reference as would permit it to include in its purview the relationship between the States and British India. The new suggestion was that the conference to be set up after the Reports of the Statutory Commission and the Indian Central Committee have been made should be made more free by excising the earlier suggestion that the conference should consider draft constitutional proposals put before it by the Government. Under the new proposal the conference would simply be for the purpose of exchanging views and seeking the greatest possible measure of agreement for the final proposals later to be laid before Parliament. The Prime Ministers draft reply remained substantially unchanged from earlier drafts and contained a passage reaffirming the purpose of the Declaration of August 1917, as inthe earlier drafts. Copies of these drafts are APPendlxL appended.These drafts were referred formally to Sir John Simon by the Prime Minister on the 19th with an expression of his earnest hope that the Commission would see its way to participate in the proposed correspondence. They were referred also to Mr. Baldwin in France under cover of a letter  from the Prime Minister, dated19th September, of which a cop,y is appended. Appendix II. They were referred also to Lord Reading bythe Secretary of Slate in person on the 20th September. Mr. Baldwin&apos;s particular attention was drawn to the new proposal inviting Indians to a conference and discussion before the Government has formulated any draft proposals of its own.No particular stress was laid on the passage in the Prime Ministers draft reply about Dominion status as that had been contained, subject to verbal alterations, in every draft prepared since Lord Irwin&apos;s return to England. The Prime Ministers letter also pointed out to Mr. Baldwin that Sir John Simon would be laying the matter formally before his Commission on the following Tuesday, 24th September. The Prime Minister in his letter said, &quot;I cannot, of course, predict what their attitude may be. If they feel difficulty about the role assigned to them, it may be that we should have to seek other, though less convenient, means of obtaining the same end. I am, therefore, sending these papers to you at the present stage on the supposition that the Commission will, in fact, agree to the course proposed, and on the understanding that should they fail to do so, a new situation would be created which may necessitate other treatment.&quot;   Mr. Baldwin, in his reply of 21st September,.which is appended, said that he had discussed Appendix III. the matter with  the  Viceroy before  he  leftEngland for France ; he thought Mr. MacDonald would understand the difficulty of his position, being unable to communicate with any of his colleagues. (Lord Peel was in the Highlands, Sir Austen Chamberlain in  the Mediterranean, Lord  Birkenhead  in America, Mr. Churchill in America,.
Mr. Amery in Canada, and Lord Hailsham in the Far East.) Nevertheless, in the circumstances, Mr. Baldwin said that he was prepared to concur in what was proposed, and that he might be relied on to do all in his power to secure the unanimous support of his part1-.Lord Reading expressed no objection on his own part to the revised proposal in regard to the conference. He did, however, for the first time, on the 20th September and on succeeding days, express a growing dislike of the proposed declaration in regard to Dominion status.On Tuesday, 24th September, the draft letters were put before the Statutory Commission. They accepted the proposal in regard to the conference, but objected to being concerned in correspondence which evoked in the course of the proposed reply from the Prime Minister a declaration in regard to the British Governments policy in India.   The Commission^ decision was communicated to the Secretary of State orallythat day. In a letter, of which a copy is r Appendlx 1V- - appended, dated 28th October, Sir John Simonwrites: &quot;The Commission decided, and I so informed you later in the day, that it could.not take part in any exchange of letters if this paragraph was included in the reply, though in other respects they were prepared to acquiesce in the modifications which you were anxious to make.&quot;On the 25th September the Secretary of State made a statement to the Cabinet on,r.   ;       r, . .  . OE the position.  The Cabinet approved in principleMinute 17, Cabinet 35. ,, -i   , i   j-   1 -    A   1the general plan embodied in the letters proposedto be exchanged on the understanding that in respect of the proposal regarding the conference it would be clear that the initiative came from the Statutory Commission. As regards the proposed statement on the subject of Dominion status, as that was now to be excluded from the correspondence, the Cabinet considered that such a statement should be made by Lord Irwin immediately on his return to India. The elaboration of details was left for settlement between the Secretary of State for India and the Prime Minister, who, in fact, saw Lord Irwin on the same day.It was then arranged and the arrangement was communicated in a minute of 26th September by the Prime Minister to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that in the altered circumstances &quot; the best way of making the proposed announcement on Indian affairs was for Irwin to make a speech after his return to India ; the speech would be on the lines which have already been approved by Baldwin and would deal only with the question of Dominion status and the conference procedure. When the speech has been delivered, it would be arranged that I should be interviewed so that 1 could confirm what Irwin has said. We thought on the whole that it would be better to announce both parts of our policy in lrwin&apos;s speech and to publish the letters at the same time.&quot;On the 26th September Sir J. Simon was informed of the Cabinet decision and communicated it to his Commission (letter of 28th October).On the 27th September the Secretary of State saw Lord Reading and showed him the suggested interchange of letters between Sir John Simon and the Prime Minister dealing&quot; with the conference (i.e. excluding as a result of the Statutory Commission^ decision, any reference to Dominion status). Lord Reading said that the Secretary of State might take it that this would be approved by Mr. Lloyd George. Lord Reading repeated his objections to an immediate declaration on the question of Dominion status on the ground, first, that he could not see within any measurable distance of time India being put on a footing with the other Dominions and that a statement now would become the text of immediate demands for its fulfilment ; second, that a Commission had been appointed to deal with the matter and it was not a moment, therefore, to anticipate the decisions of the Commission whose work would be rendered valueless and its Report discounted in advance. These were the views, not of himself only, but also of Mr. Lloyd George.The Secretary of State also saw Sir John Simon on the 27th September. Sir John agreed that it would be better, if Lord Irwin was making a statement in Bombay, that the correspondence between Sir John and the Prime Minister should be published at the same time. He thought he should inform the Commission of the Governments and the Viceroy&apos;s intentions, but the Secretary of State asked him to postpone doing this until the plan was finally settled. Sir John again expressed himself very strongly against any declaration being made.  (Secretary of State&apos;s note, dated 27th September.)Lord Irwin was informed the same day of the position, which was on the 27th September that the interchange of letters in regard to the widened scope of the
-Commission&apos;s Report, and the proposed conference was approved ; and that the declaration in regard to Dominion status was approved in outline By the Prime Minister ; that the making of some such statement had Mr. Baklwin\s support (in his letter of 21st September written in rather different circumstances), but/^Spp^osed by Lord Reading and Mr. Lloyd George, and that the Cabinet had approved the issue by Lord Irwin in India of a statement or the making of a speech embodying the substance of the Simon-Prime Minister correspondence, and also the declaration as to British purpose in India.Lord Irwin expressed regret, but no surprise, at Lord Reading&apos;s attitude, &quot; though in July when Simon still saw no objection to a Dominion status declaration guardedly made, Reading evinced no objection either.&quot; He added that Mr. Baldwin was going to see him on Monday, 30th September, and that he did not think the draft declaration was really exposed to Lord Reading^ fears of raising false hopes of immediate-conferment of some new status.It was subsequently arranged as the result of correspondence between Lord Irwin -and Lord Gosohen that it would be more convenient that the former&apos;s statement should be made, not in the shape of a speech on arrival at Bombay, but in a Gazette announcement to be made at a conveniently early date.At the beginning of October Lord Irwin drafted a statement. The draft of this statement and of the letters to be exchanged between Sir John Simon and the Prime Minister, together with an explanatory memorandum by the Secretary of State, were considered at a Cabinet on the 7th October. In regard to the declaration of Dominion status, the Secretary of State drew attention to the promise to give responsible government to India made in the Declaration of 20th August j 917 and embodied in the preamble to the Act of 1919, under section 84a of which the Simon Commission is appointed. He submitted that the repetition of the preamble and a declaration of its implications cannot therefore be held to be in anticipation of the findings of the Commission appointed under the Act. He also drew attention to and quoted many official statements reaffirming the Declaration of 1917 and submitted that it is desirable to reassert His Majestj^s Governments sincere belief in the purpose set out in the declaration and in the preamble in view of the growing distrust of late years -amongst Indian politicians of the sincerity of the declared intention of the British Government. On the 7th October, Lord Irwin agreed to an alteration of his statement in regard to the conference which was suggested by Sir John Simon. On the 8th October, in deference to representations made by Lord Reading and Mr. Lloyd George at an interview, he made two further alterations. The first was to substitute for the words &quot; I am authorised on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government to state clearly that, in their judgment, it is implicit in the Declaration of 1917 that the attainment of Dominion status must be regarded as the natural issue of India&apos;s constitutional progress,&quot; the wrords &quot; I am authorised on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government to state clearly that, in their judgment, it is implicit in the Declaration of 1917 that the natural issue of India&apos;s constitutional progress as there contemplated is the attainment of Dominion status.&quot; The second was to delete from the last paragraph of his statement the sentence &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have opened the door to a more excellent way.&quot;In letters exchanged with Lord Reading on the 8th and 9th October, Lord Irwin pointed out that the first alteration had the effect of linking up what is now said much more closely than it even might have appeared to be linked before with the method and atmosphere of the 1917 Declaration. Lord Reading, though grateful for the alterations, made it plain that they did not fully meet his objections.Lord Irwin  also prepared and^ gave to Lord Reading a note  distinguishing Ad appendix Y &quot; between the purpose and method or policy anda copy is appended. Lord Irwin sailed for India on the 10th October.On the 23rd October Lord Reading had a conversation with Mr. Benn. He admitted that the alterations made in his statement by Lord Irwin had gone some Avay to meet his point of view, but he reiterated his objection to the making of such a statement before the Report of the Simon Commission was completed, and said that considerable unrest had been created amongst Conservatives by newspaper rumours of some momentous declaration. Lord Reading thought that the matter would certainly be raised in Parliament, one of the strongest grounds of complaint being that such a declaration was made before the Report of the Commission and without the assent of Parliament first.being sought. On the 27th October he wrote at length repeating his objections and his fears of the consequences in this country and in India.   He drew attention to the point that so far as he was aware the Simon
Commission had not given its assent. He inferred from this fact and the intention to proceed immediately with the declaration that the Government regarded it as of capital importance. He pointed out that this would end the understanding at present existing between parties in this country that all questions relating to the constitutional development of India should be postponed until the Commission had presented its Report. He therefore urged that no action of the nature Appendix VI. contemplated should be taken till after the SimonCommission has reported and Parliament and the country were in possession of their conclusions and advice. A copy of this letter is appended.On the 28th October Sir John Simon addressed a letter to the Secretary of State for India pointing out that if, following the publication of the letters between the Commission and the Prime Minister, in which the leaders of the other Parties had expressed concurrence, a statement were made to expound or amplify the Declaration of 1917, Parliamentary challenge would result. Questions would be inevitable whether the Commission had been consulted on the subject and what its position was. He then gave a resume of the events after 24th September. He urged that a way might be found of keeping the Commission outside the area of controversy, andassured the Secretary of State that he would do -Appendix IV. everything in his power to this end.   A copy ofthe letter is appended.On the 28th October Mr. Baldwin addressed a letter to Mr. Snowden of whicha copy is attached. He drew attention also to the-Appendix VII. understanding between Parties that, in view of the peculiar status of the jSimon Commission, India has remained outside the field of party controversy. He pointed out that His Majesty&apos;s Government now proposed within a few months of the presentation of the Commission^ Report to make a declaration on future policy. Without commenting on the terms of the declaration, he, on behalf of his Party, urged that this action would be not merely inconsistent with the role assigned to the Commission, but would amount to a sudden reversal by executive action of a considered decision of Parliament. He submitted the Conservative view that to anticipate the Commission^ Report by a new declaration would impair the authority of the Commission, would defeat the intention of Parliament as expressed in the Government of India Act, and gravely compromise its liberty of action when the question should come before it. He appealed, therefore, to the acting Prime Minister to avert such a disaster and at any rate postpone action until the Prime Minister should have returned. In regard to his own position, he explained that, when he was consulted at Bourges, he understood that the proposed declaration as to Dominion status had the concurrence of Sir John Simon and had been arranged by consultation with him. His discovery that Sir John Simon now viewed the-consequences of the Declaration, with grave anxiety put the matter in an entirely new light. He drew attention to the following Appendix II. passage in the Prime Ministers letter6 of 19thSeptember: &quot;I am therefore sending these papers to you at the present stage on the supposition that the Commission will, in fact, ageee to the course proposed and on the understanding that should they fail to do so, a new situation would be created which may necessitate other treatment,&quot; and submitted that a new situation has in fact arisen. He pointed out that he had never applied his mind or was given the opportunity of doing so to the contingency that the Chairman of the Commission vigorously dissented from the proposals put before him at Bourges. In view of this letter an urgent private telegram was sent by the Secretary of State for India to the-Viceroy in the early hours of 29th October, stating that the Cabinet has in no way receded from its decision, but feels that, in view of Mr. Baldwiifs request, it would be reasonable to await the Prime Ministers return. The Secretary of State added a personal message that Mr. Snowden authorised him to say that the Cabinet view is unchanged. He therefore urged the Viceroy most earnestly to stand firmly by the declaration, even if it were postponed to await the Prime Ministers return.Lord Irwin replied that postponement would now be disastrous. He had privately intimated what was intended to political leaders and the Princes, and to alter the-time-table at the eleventh hour, when the atmosphere was one of intense expectancy, would inevitably arouse immediate suspicions and would incur grave risks of spoiling the entire effect. He asked that Mr. Snowden. should show this telegram to Mr. Baldwin if he thought fit. This Mr. Snowden did on the same clay (29th October).(
4*12JS zj l-J[AppendicesOn the 30th October the Cabinet had the position put before them and decided that there should be no alteration in the programme, that Mr. Baldwin and Sir John Simon should be informed that the Cabinet could not agree to their request for delay, though, in ordinary circumstances, this would have been a reasonable proposal, and left it to Mr. Snowden and the Secretary of State for India to meet Mr. Baldwin&apos;s request to have lor himself and his colleagues copies of the telegrams exchanged with the Viceroy.The Viceroy was therefore instructed to proceed in all particulars with the plan -already arranged, but was informed that in order to meet the Statutory Commission^ desire not to be made to appear closely associated with his statement, the letters were &quot;being published on the 31st October instead of 1st November.Mr. Baldwin was shown a copy of the Viceroy&apos;s telegram, excluding the personal portion, and at his request was given a copy, also a copy of the telegram sent to theViceroy on the 29th October, and in a letter of Appendix VIII. the 30tJi 0ctober which is attached, he criticisedit on four grounds as giving an inadequate statement of the situation and urged, even at the eleventh hour, the danger of authorising a statement which, in the deliberate view of himself and his colleagues, might render impossible co-operation between all parties upon which the whole future of India Appendix IX. may easily be found to depend.   A copy of these telegrams is appended.On the 1st November Mr. Lloyd George ashed a private notice question of which and of the answer a copy is appended.   The Appendix X. answers to the first and second part were pre-pared in full consultation with Sir John Simon, who promised to use his best efforts with Mr. Lloyd George to check supplementaries.W. B.4th November 1929.
APPENDIX I (1).Note. This is a draft approved by Simon and the (Jommission and it referred to the-earlier scheme of laying draft proposals before the conference. It is presumed, that his new letter would be on the same lines with the necessary amendments.Sir John Simon to the Prime Minister.My dear Prime Minister,The Joint Conference of the Statutory Commission and the Indian Central Committee which has been taking evidence in London, supplementary to the testimony and material collected in India, has now finished its sittings, and both wings of the Conference are entering upon the final stage of their work. Before proceeding further, however, the Statutory Commission desires to address you with an enquiry and a suggestion.As our investigation has proceeded, we have become more and more impressed, in considering the direction which the future constitutional development of India is likely to take, with the importance of bearing in mind the relations which may develop between British India and the Indian States. We are not at present in the-position to forecast the Report which we shall hope in due course to present to Parliament. It is, however, already evident to us that, whatever may be the scheme Avhich Parliament will ultimately approve for the future constitution and governance of Brilish India, it is essential that the methods by which the future relationship-between these two constituent parts of Greater India may be adjusted, should be fully examined.We have carefully considered the Report of the Butler Committee, but the terms, of reference to that body did not cover the whole ground to be surveyed so far as these relations are concerned. Our own recommendations, if we were to exclude from our purview the wider problem which we have indicated, would, we feel, be unduly restricted, and we therefore wish, before going further, to ascertain whether we should have the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government in giving this possibly extended interpretation to our own.terms of reference. It is not our purpose to seek to explore the field alread3r traversed by the Butler Committee ; but at certain points an inevitable contact takes place between the respective problems of the States and British India.We venture to point out that if the Report we are preparing and the proposals to be subsequently framed by the Government take this wider range, it would appear necessary, if only on this ground, for the Government to revise the scheme of procedure to be followed after these proposals are made known. It seems to us that what j would be required would be the setting up of some sort of conference [to consider be draft constitutional proposals put before it by the Government] after the Reports of   the Statutory Commission and the Indian Central Committee have been made and consideredjand their work has been completed, and that in this conference His Majesty&apos;s Government would meet both representatives of British India and representatives of the States (not necessarily always together) for the purpose of exchanging views and seeking the greatest possible measure of agreement for the final proposals which it would later be the duty of His Majesty&apos;s Government to submit to Parliament. The procedure by Joint Parliamentary Committee conferring with delegations from the Indian Legislature and other bodies, which was previously contemplated, and is referred to in my letter 1o the Viceroy of 6th February 1928, would still be appropriate for the examination of the Bill when it is subsequently placed before Parliament, but would, we think, obviously have to be preceded by some such conference as we have-indicated.We realise that it is not for the Statutory Commission to devise this subsequent procedure in detail, for our task will be discharged when we have reported. But we feel that it is desirable to obtain an assurance from His Majesty&apos;s Government that we shall not, in their view, be travelling beyond the terms of reference approved by Parliament if we pursue what seems to us an integral element in our investigation. We have also thought it right to make plain to His Majesty&apos;s Government the consequence that such an assurance from His Majesty&apos;s Government is likely ultimately to involve, in order that the future course of procedure may be so shaped as to provide means for consulting with the Indian States, and to promote the Ifull co-operation of all parties and interests in the solution of the Indian problem as.   a whole. \[The Indian Central Committee asks to associate itself with the above suggestions,?  and this letter may therefore be regarded as coming from both sides of the Jojint Conference. ]
APPENDIX I (2). Prom the Prime Minister to Sir J. Simon.My dear Simon,Your letter on behalf of the Statutory Commission [with which I understand the Indian Central Committee desires to be associated], raises issues of such importance that f. have thought right before answering it to consult the leaders of other Parties. I &quot;nave now been able to ascertain their views, and they have been good enough to concur in the terms of my reply.His Majesty&apos;s Government welcome the intimation that your letter affords of the desire entertained by [both] the Statutory Commission [and the Indian Central Committee] to deal in their [respective] report[s] with the wider aspects of the subject to which your letter directs attention. It appears to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, as it does to those on behalf of whom you write, that your work would be necessarily incomplete unless it included a careful examination of the methods by which the future relationship of British India and the Indian States may be adjusted.Events indeed have shown that such wider treatment is unavoidable if your Commission is to be in a position to render full assistance to Parliament in considering the development of the policy which, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, is implied in the Declaration of August 1917, and in the preamble of the Government of India Act. The policy of Parliament was there declared to be that of providing for &quot;the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government regard it as implicit in this statement of policy that India should, through the realisation of responsible government, be enabled to attain as early as may be full Dominion status, and further, that her political institutions should be so designed as to afford the surest means of directing her constitutional progress steadily to this goal. As this is the accepted purpose of all British parties, it follows that in any constitutional changes that may be made, it will be their single desire to lend all possible help to the people of India in its fulfilment.In the complete development of this policy it is evidently important that the Indian States should ultimately be afforded an opportunity of finding their place, and it seems, therefore, clear that your Commission should be in a position to secure that its recommendations, even if they cannot indicate the precise lines which this development should take, shall not be inconsistent with the attainment of the final purpose in view.His Majesty&apos;s Government have given full consideration to what you have said in your letter concerning the desirability from this point of view, if from no other, of some revision of the later procedure as at present contemplated, and I am glad to be able to inform you that they concur in the view that you have expressed. His Majesty&apos;s Government are, with you, deeply sensible of the importance of thus bringing the whole problem under comprehensive review ; and that under conditions which may promise to secure as great a degree of unanimity as may be. practicable. Bis Majesty&apos;? Govern-ment are also greatly concerned to find means by which they may approach the treatment of the broad question of British-Indian constitutional advance in co-operation with all those who can most authoritatively speak for British-Indian political opinion. It seems to them that both these objects can best be achieved by the adoption of procedure that will permit the most free interchange of opinion by all concerned, in advance of the stage at which His Majesty&apos;s Government have laid any proposals before Parliament which may be expected later, as you point out, to form the subject of examination by a Joint Parliamentary Committee. When, therefore, your Commission has submitted their Report and His Majesty&apos;s Government- have been able, in consultation with the Government of India, to consider these matters in the light of all the material then available, they will propose to invite representatives of different parties and interests in British India and representatives of the Indian States to meet them, separately or together, as circumstances may demand, for the purpose of conference and discussion in regard both to the British-Indian and All-Indian problems.It will be their earnest hope that by this means it may subsequently prove possible on these grave issues to submit definite proposals to Parliament which may command a wide measure of general assent.4037 B
JOAPPENDIX II.Letter from Prime Minister to Mr. Baldwin, dated 19th September, 1929. My Dear Baldwin,I think you had some conversation with Irwin as to an interchange of letters between Simon and myself dealing with the position of the Princes and the procedure to be adopted when the Commission has completed its report. Apart from the question of the States both Irwin and Wedgwood Been are greatly concerned if possible to take some step that may have a sedative effect on the Indian situation, which is causing some anxiety. The result of a good many discussions in which I have participated with them, is contained in the enclosed papers. Irwin attaches the greatest importance as do I to ensuring as far as possible that any important step we take in regard to India shall be taken with the concurrence of all British parties just as all parties concurred in the appointment of the Statutory Commission.You will observe that as my reply to Simon is framed, we should propose to invite Indians to conference and discussion before the Government has formulated any draft proposals of their own. I am advised that in this form the invitation will carry much greater chance of acceptance in India, but I need hardly point out that, before entering into conference, we or any other Government would be under the necessity of giving careful consideration to the problem and that no decisive step can be taken without the concurrence of the two other Parties which form a majority in the House of Commons. Simon is laying the matter formally before his Commission on Tuesday, and I cannot, of course, predict what their attitude may be. If they feel difficulty about the role assigned to them, it may be that we should have to seek other, though less convenient, means of attaining the same end. I am therefore sending these papers to you at the present stage on the supposition that the Commission will, in fact, agree to the course proposed and on the understanding that, should they fail to do so, a new situation would be created which may necessitate other treatment. I would have preferred to avoid inflicting these papers upon you at all till your holiday had been completed and the Commission had been able to reach their decision; but I am, unhappily, the servant of time in that, as you know, I have arranged to leave this country for America on Friday. If therefore you could send a rephy by the messenger who brings these papers, I should be very grateful.Yours very sincerely,J. Ramsay MacDonald.APPENDIX III.Letter from Mr. Baldvdn to the Prime Minister.Private. Bourges,Dear Prime Minister, 21st September, 1929.I have carefully considered the papers you have sent me with regard to the procedure of the Simon Commission.I did discuss the matter with the Viceroy before I left England, but you will understand the difficulty&apos; of my position, being unable to communicate with any of my colleagues.Nevertheless, in the circumstances I am prepared to concur in what is proposed and you may rely cn my doing all that is in my power to secure the unanimous support of my party.Yours very sincerely, (Signed) Stanley Baldwin.APPENDIX IV.Letter from Sir J. Simon to Secretary of State for India.lioyal Courts of Justice, London, W.C. 2, My dear Benn, 28*/i October, 1929.The newspapers make it clear that if, following upon the publication of the letters to which the Commission has agreed, and in which the leaders of other Parties concur, some statement is made at this time by the Governments authority in exposition or amplification of the Montagu declaration of the 20th August, 1917, parliamentary challenge will be raised. I regard this outcome as wholly deplorable, and, apart from other consequences, it is bound to involve questions to the
Government as to whether the Commission has been consulted on the subject and where it stands in the matter. On. this there can be no controversy between us, as I have kept you informed of the Commission^ attitude, but it none the less may be well to set out a resume of the facts.I put before the Commission, on the 24th September, the revised draft which you then proposed for Ihe Prime Minister&apos;s answer to our communication dealing with Indian States, and with a consequential change of procedure. That draft contained a paragraph dealing with a different subject matter, and expounding the Governments view of the declaration of 1917. The Commission decided, and I so informed you later in the day, that it would not take any part in any exchange of letters if this paragraph was included in the reply, though in other respects we were prepared to acquiesce in the modifications which you were anxious to make. Two days later you informed me that the Cabinet had had the matter before it and that you had told your colleagues of our objection. You also said that the Cabinet still desired that some statement on the subject should be made, but that it would be made independently of the letters. On the 26th September I reported this to the Commission. We have not been consulted upon, or made aware of, the terms of the proposed announcement, but we now understand that whatever it may be, its issue at this time will not carry the assent of all parties in Parliament.The Commission at its meeting to-day felt that it was necessary to put before you the view which we take of this latest development, as the prospect of parliamentary differences on the subject vitally affects the position, and is calculated to react seriously on the discharge of our own work. We do not for one moment claim to have any right to criticise or interfere with decisions on administrative policy. Our sole desire is to carry through our own work as well as we can undisturbed by parliamentary controversy. We assume, of course, that the interim declaration which is proposed does not involve any alteration of the conditions under which we agreed to serve, but we do not intend to offer any opinion on matters within our terms of reference until we sign our Report. Indeed, the complications of the questions referred to us are so great, and the importance of a right decision hereafter so grave, that we have not found two years, during which we have been working together, any too long to reach a conclusion on many points.I hope you will excuse me if I add one other word on my own behalf. The work of conducting the Commission has not been light or easy, and the most difficult part of its labours lies immediately before us. It is impossible to exaggerate the strength which I, as Chairman, have derived from the fact that there has been complete absence of parliamentary controversy about India ever since the announcement of our appointment was made in November 1927. It is this, and the unfailing loyalty of my colleagues, that have alone rendered the discharge of the task possible.I most earnestly trust that a way may be found of keeping the Commission entirely outside the area of controversy, if controversy there has to be; and you may be sure that I will do everything in my power to this end.Yours very sincerely,John Simon.APPENDIX V.Note by Lord Irwin on his Statement.1. THE Statement attempts to distinguish (and I hope succeeds in doing so) between Purpose and Method or Policy.2. It limits Dominion Status to the sphere of Purpose, and, therefore, the question is whether or not it is dangerous to proclaim Dominion Status as the purpose.3. The objection taken is that the explicit announcement of Dominion Status as the purpose will inevitably suggest to the Indian mind that its attainment as a practical policy is both less difficult and less remote than in fact it is likely to be, and that political pressure on Great Britain from India will be intensified.4. As regards the last point, it is axiomatic in the present Indian situation that the Nationalist pressure will be as strong as the quasi-democratic equipment of the 1919 Act, assisted by a Press almost entirely anti-Government, can make it. In these quarters this pressure will be maintained in any case. But the more important point is whether this pressure should be maintained upon the lines of demanding
the fullest development within the Empire, or whether it will gradually become a demand for independence outside the Empire. A declaration of Dominion Status as our ultimate purpose will, I believe, greatly strengthen the hands of those who want the first in the battle they are waging with those who want the second; without it there is danger of Indian opinion developing on separatist lines.5. As regards the objection that such a declaration as it is proposed to make will have the effect of suggesting that the Purpose can be earlier or more easily attained than the facts of India render probable, and that, therefore, while it is prudent to speak of Responsible Government it is rash to speak of Dominion Status, does not this argument really rest upon a reluctance to admit as your Purpose for India anything more than a form of restricted Responsible Government ? But I cannot reconcile this with the statements that have been made about &apos;&apos; equal partnership,&quot; etc., or with my own Instrument of Instructions.If, on the other hand, it is sought to distinguish between full Responsible Government and Dominion Status, as your Purpose for India, I suggest the distinction is not substantial. The problems that evidently have to be surmounted by India before she attains Dominion Status have not less certainly got to be surmounted before she can attain full Responsible Government, and I suggest that when she has got the latter (and British India can&apos;t get it except in association with the States) she will in practice have attained Dominion Status, or at least this will be the inevitable sequence in her constitutional development.6. It is quite clear that either will take a long time, and meanwhile, with an India encouraged to think politically on Western lines, the compulsory partnership between Great Britain and India is not likely to be free from difficulty and friction. I should feel it a task of even greater difficulty than in any case it is bound to be if by refusal, in face of alleged doubts, to make our ultimate purpose plain, we were to afford ground to our enemies to say that we intended India to occupy a permanently subordinate place in an Empire of white nations.APPENDIX VI.Letter from Lord Reading to Secretary of State for India.32, Cnrzon Street, May fair, W. My dear Secretary of State, 27th October, 1929.Ever since I left India it has been my earnest desire to give full support to Government in its policy regarding India, and it is therefore with greatest regret that I find myself at variance with Lord Irwin and you upon the pronouncement it is intended to make on the 31st October. By the courtesy of Lord Irwin and yourself I have already had opportunities of presenting my views. Nevertheless, I must return to the subject even at this late hour, because of the serious conse-quences which, in my judgment, will ensue, both here and in India, from the proposed action.The selection of this particular moment, immediately after the return of the Viceroy from consultation with you and His Majesty&apos;s Government, and when the Simon Commission is engaged in considering its Report, will lead Indians to the conclusion that the Declaration imports a change of policy, and brings the final stage of the constitutional development appreciably nearer in point of time. I am aware that both you and Lord Irwin maintain that the policy remains unchanged, and that the pronouncement is made merely for the purpose of setting at rest doubts Avhich have arisen in the minds of Indian politicians regarding the meaning of &quot;responsible Government&quot; and the ultimate destiny of India within the Empire. I cannot but think that Indian politicians will believe that the making of the Declaration now and without waiting for the Report of the Simon Commission is evidence of a new policy.In order to obviate misconception and misinterpretation, may I once more urge that a clear and explicit statement should be made in the pronouncement, to the effect that the conditions and reservations in the Declaration of 1917 and the Preamble to the Government of India Act, 1919. continue in their full force. Failing a precise, unequivocal statement of this character. I am convinced that misunderstanding will arise sooner or later in India, and all experience shows that this danger should be most carefully avoided.The effect in this Country must, I fear, inevitably lead to serious political con-troversy, which all Parties have desired to exclude in relation to the constitutional
position of India. The appointment of the Simon Commission and the selection oi its Members from the three Political Parties, with the assent of Parliament, led to a general understanding that all questions relating to the constitutional development of India should be postponed until the Commission presented its Report. For the course you are now proposing to take, you have failed to obtain the support of the Liberal Party and, 1 have reason to believe, of the Conservative Party. So far as I am aware, the Simon Commission has not given its assent; nevertheless it is intended, as 1 gather, to proceed immediately and to make the Declaration, which must be regarded as of capital importance, otherwise it seems inconceivable that Government should persist in the face of the opposition it has met.Whatever may be the effect of the Government action in India, there can be no doubt that in this Country and in Parliament there will be an end of the general understanding above mentioned.I would beg of you again to consider whether, in these circumstances, it would not be more to the advantage of India that no action of the character proposed should be taken until after the Simon Commission has reported and Parliament and the Country are in possession of their conclusions and advice.Yours sincerely,Reading.APPENDIX VII.Letter from Mr. Baldwin to Mr. Snowden.10,.Upper Brook Street, W. 1, Dear Mr. Chancellor, 28th October, 1929.Mr. Wedgwood Benn will doubtless have informed you of the statement which I made to him last Thursday after consulting with my colleagues in regard to the Declaration which His Majesty&apos;s Government propose that the Viceroy should make on his return to Delhi.The matter, however, is of such gravity that I think I ought also to communicate directly with you as Acting Prime Minister in the absence of Mr. MacDonald.Briefly, our position is as follows : We do not think it necessary to make any comment on the proposal to set up another Committee in addition to those foreseen by the Government of India Act or at present existing. Our concern is with the passage in the Declaration which speaks of Dominion status.When Parliament took into consideration the changes proposed in the Montagu-Chelmsford Report it was recognised on all hands that we were embarking on a great experiment. The co-operation of all parties was secured, and Parliament itself, after most careful consideration by a Joint Commit tee, as well as in the separate Houses, laid down the procedure which was to be followed.The Simon Commission is therefore not, like other Commissions, the creation of a Government of the day acting proprio motu, but the fulfilment of a provision definitely made by Parliament for the careful review after a lapse of years of the results obtained, and an unpredjudiced report on the lessons and consequences to be drawn from them. As a result of the procedure so carefully thought out and so definitely laid down in the Government of India Act, India has remained, as we earnestly hope it may continue, outside the field of party controversy, and the steps taken in fulfilment of the intentions of Parliament have throughout been taken in consultation with other parties and with the assent of all.It is now proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government that within a few months of the presentation of the Commission^ Report a Declaration of future policy should be made through the mouth of the Viceroy. We carefully refrain from commenting on the terms of this Declaration and from prejudging in any way the conclusions Avhich we may ultimately reach on the subject. Our only desire at this moment is to urge with all the force we can command and with a full sense of the responsibility which is shared by us as by every party in the State that to make any new declaration in anticipation of the Commission would be not merely inconsistent with the role assigned to the Commission, but would amount to a sudden reversal by executive action of the considered decision of Parliament.Whatever the action which Parliament may ultimately think it right to approve when it has received and examined the Commission&apos;s Report, it is our considered view that to anticipate that Report by a new Declaration would impair the authority of the Commission, would defeat the intention of Parliament as expressed in the Government of India Act, and must gravely compromise its liberty of action when the question comes before it.
We appeal to you as Acting Prime Minister to avert such, a disaster. Above all, we urge that no step of such consequence ought to be taken whilst the Prime Minister is on the high seas or until he has been made aware of the objections which we have thought it our duty to submit for his and your consideration.I desire to add a word as to my own position. When the intentions of the Govern-ment were communicated to me at Bourges, I understood that the proposed Declaration had the concurrence of Sir John Simon and had been arranged in consultation with him. I now learn that he, like others who in one capacity or another have been intimately concerned with the Government of India in recent years, views its consequences with grave anxiety. You will realise that this discovery puts, the matter in an entirely new light.Let me recall to your mind the following sentence from the Prime Minister&apos;s letter to me of September 19th when he sent me the draft of the letters to be exchanged between himself and Sir John Simon :  -&quot; I am therefore sending these papers to you at the present stage on the supposition that the Commission will, in fact, agree to the course proposed and on the understanding that, should they fail to do so, a new situation would be created which may necessitate other treatment.&quot;That new situation has, in fact, arisen.I was prepared to run a considerable personal risk as long as I believed that the Government, this Commission and the Viceroy were in agreement.I never applied my mind, or indeed was given the opportunity of doing so, to the contingency that the Chairman of the Commission vigorously dissented from the proposals put before me.Yours sincerely,Stanley Baldwin.APPENDIX VIII.Letter from Mr. Baldwin to Mr. Snowden.Urgent. House of Commons,My dear Chancellor of the Exchequer, 30th October, 1929.I and some of my colleagues have read the copy of the telegram which you sent to the Viceroy and his reply which you had previously made known to us.We are all of opinion that the telegram to the Viceroy wholly and most unfortunate-nately failed to acquaint him with the actual facts of the situation. For :1. Pie was not told that my personal assent was given on the assumption expressly made in the Prime Ministers letter to me that the Simon Commission concurred in the proposed declaration.2. He was not told that I and my late colleagues, on being informed that Simon and all the Commissioners resented any such statement being made, unanimously refused to be parties to it.3. He was not told that Reading and the Liberal leaders took the same view.4. He was not told that Simon had officially informed the Government that in the opinion of himself and his colleagues the proposed declaration would be gravely subversive of the authority of the Commission.The Viceroy&apos;s reply in these circumstances was given in ignorance of facts which it was essential that he should know.I must most earnestly press upon you, even at the eleventh hour, the grave respon-sibility which the Government will assume if they authorise a statement which in our deliberate judgment may render impossible that co-operation between all parties upon which the whole future of India may easily be found to depend.I am, dear Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sincerely Yours,Stanley Baldwin.The Chancellor of the Exchequer.
APPENDIX IX (1).Telegram (unparaphrased) from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 29th October, 1929 (3.0 a.m.).Immediate.86-U. Private and Personal. Baldwin has written Snowden saying that Simon and others intimately concerned with the Government of India in recent years view with grave anxiety the proposed declaration- on Dominion Status and he strongly urges that no step of such consequence ought to be taken until the Prime Ministers return on Friday. In view of this would it be possible without prejudice to your plan of publicity for you to postpone announcement till Sunday or Monday ?Please understand Cabinet has in no way receded from its decisions, but feels that in view of Baldwin&apos;s request it is reasonable to await Prime Ministers return.What follows is my personal view of the situation. This opposition is the outcome of Reading&apos;s campaign assisted by Birkenhead and others. Simon as you know originally assented to declaration.Although Snowden and I think it wise to await MacDonald&apos;s return, SnowTden authorised me to state that the Cabinets view is unchanged. I therefore urge you most earnestly to stand firmly by the Declaration even if postponed to await MacDonald&apos;s return. If you will refuse to budge I will support you absolutely and we can succeed.I do not believe there is any real danger in fhe House of Commons.APPENDIX IX (2).Telegram (unparaphrased) from Viceroy, to Secretary of State, dated 29th October, i929.Immediate.50-U. I have carefully considered your telegram No. 86-U. As regards the declaration itself, I have no hesitation whatever in adhering to it and should regard any suggestion that it should be further modified as impossible. As regards post-ponement, I scarcely see on what ground this can reasonably be pressed in connection with the Prime Minister&apos;s return, as he has already, after full con-sideration, reached the decision on the main question. From my own point of view I feel no less strongly that postponement would now be disastrous. I have conveyed a private message to the British Indian leaders and to the Princes as arranged. I have authorised the Governors to speak to prominent individuals, and several of those who are anxious to support the policy of the Government, both British Indian politicians and Princes, have arranged to be interviewed after the statement is made.All this is on the assumption that the statement will be made according to the time-table arranged. To alter it at the eleventh hour when the atmosphere is one of intense expectancy would inevitably arouse immediate suspicions and incur great risk of spoiling the entire effect. From information which has just reached me, I have now little doubt that the Congress, as well as other more moderate opinion, will be disposed to accept it, and I see a real possibility of the thing coming off as well as the Cabinet have always hoped. I most earnestly hope, therefore, that the Cabinet will not feel it necessary to instruct me to postpone, which for the practical reasons I have stated is now impossible without gravest damage, and that Snowden will explain to Baldwin, showing him, if he thinks fit, this telegram. Please let me hear very urgently.APPENDIX X.Private Notice Question, dated 1st November, 1929.Mr, Lloyd George, To ask the Secretary of State for India whether the Statutory Commission on Indian Government was consuiTed with reference to the passage in the important statement made by the Viceroy of India yesterday which relates to the constitutional status of India in the Empire; if so, whether the Commission concurred; and whether that passage is intended to indicate any change, either in substance or in point of time, in- the policy announced by previous Governments.
APPENDIX IX (1).Telegram (unparaphrased) from Secretary of State to Yiceroy, dated 29th October, 1929 (3.0 a.m.).Immediate.86-U. Private and Personal.

Please let me hear very urgently.APPENDIX X.Private Notice Question, dated 1st November, 1929.Mr, Lloyd George, To ask the Secretary of State for India whether the Statutory Commission on Indian Government was consulted with reference to the passage in the important statement made by the Viceroy of India yesterday which relates to the constitutional status of India in the Empire; if so, whether the Commission concurred; and whether that passage is intended to indicate any change, either in substance or in point of time, in the policy announced by previous Governments.
Answer to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s Private Notice Question, dated 1st November, 1929.The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. It is due to the Statutory Commission that I should make it perfectly clear that they were not consulted. The second part of the question, therefore, does not arise. As to the third part, the passage referred to is intended to set out the goal of British policy as stated in the Declaration of August 1917. In view of the doubts which have been expressed both in Great Britain and India regarding the interpretation to be placed on the intentions of the British Government in enacting the Statute of 1919 the Viceroy was authorised, on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, to state clearly that, in their judgment, it is implicit in the Declaration of 1917 that the natural issue of India&apos;s constitutional progress, as there contemplated, is the attainment of Dominion status.Questions of policy involving changes either in substance or in time cannot be considered until the Commission and the Indian Central Committee have submitted their Reports and His Majesty&apos;s Government have been able, in consultation with the Government of India, to consider these matters in the light of all the material then available, and after the meeting of the Conference which it is intended to-summon.
