1 c3-*- V (J2HIS X)OCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY Off HI3 BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.^ LSECRET 0 A B I H El, COPY HQ.. .1.cp.273( 9)    gIRSg REPORT Off HOURS OP EMPLOYMENT BILL 0OMMITS.EE.1.     At the International Labour Conference in June last, the British Government representative was authorised to state that His Majesty1s Government proposed to take the necessary steps to ensure at the earliest possible moment the ratification of the Washington Hours Convention, and that in introducing the hours legislation necessary, His Majesty1s Government would take account both of the Washington Convention and the London Agreement.     On 24th July, the Cabinet (Cabinet 29 (29) Conclusion 9), having considered certain questions arising on the proposed Hours of Employment Bill, appointed us a Committee to assist the Minister of Labour in the consideration of those questions and in the drafting of the Bill. 2.     Before this oountry can ratify the Convention, an Act bringing the law into conformity with it must have been passed.      In considering the neoessary changes in the law, we reviewed several points of very serious difficulty, the chief of which were:-(a)   Railways:Under the Convention, the existing agreements as to hours of work on the railways oould not stand. Putting the matter quite shortly, the arrangements under which hours worked on Sunday are not counted as part of the normal weekly hours but are, in effeot, systematic overtime not due to &quot;pressure of work&quot;, would have to be altered and (subjeot to exceptions which do not affect the main Issue), the normal hours during a week of seven days would have to be kept within the limit of 48.
(b)   Goal Mining:A strict interpretation of the Convention might entail a normal limit of eight hours from bank to bank for each underground worker.     Even if only on winding time need be counted as coming within the terms of the Convention, an appreciable decrease in present hours would be involved in many cases. (o)   Five-day week, etc.Broadly speaking, the Convention does not allow more than nine hours to be worked on any one day.     It would, therefore, not be possible under it to have (save in certain limited classes of cases) a 5-day week of more than 45 hours, or a 4-day week of more than 36 hours.(&amp;)   Averaging over a Period.Under the Convention arrangements for averaging hours over a period so as to have more than 48 hours in one week and less in another are only permissible in certain limited classes of employment and only when if covered by an agreement between workers1 and employers1 organisations. (e)   Overtime.Ihe Convention, apart from special provision for preparatory or complementary work, limits overtime to temporary exceptions for dealing with exceptional oases of pressure of work and under the Convention regulations have to be made fixing the maximum number of additional hours in each instance.     this reduoes the possibilities of working overtime to limits which are too strict for the ordinary requirements of many industries. 3*     After considering these points of difficulty (and a number of others of a less far-reaching nature) we have oome to the conclusion that i,t is not practicable to propose a Bill which
1 wwould give full effect to the Washington Convention without arousing very serious opposition, not only from employers&apos; organisations, but also from trade unions.     This opposition, moreover, would be on points where it would not be in the interests of the workers themselves or of industry generally to alter the existing practice.In our view, therefore, the right line to follow is to prepare a Bill which will be based on British conditions, and which at the same time will contain the substance of the Convention.     A Bill on these lines can we think be so framed as to give - what adherence to the literal terms of the Convention Will not give - the prospect of leading the way to International agreement in the future.     There is reason to believe that such a Bill would be welcomed by the International Labour Office.4.      On the-points of difficulty outlined above, our proposals are:-(a)   Railways:The substantial point is that the existing agree-ments must, we assume, be maintained.     V/e therefore propose either (a) that the Bill should apply to railways, but that it should expressly leave railwaymen to be dealt with solely under the provisions of the Railways Act,19 l; or (b) that the railwaymen should not be specifically exempted., but that power should be given to the Minister of Labour to approve, as being within the provisions of the Act, agreements that are not less favourable than the provisions of the Act.It depends to some extent on legal and technioal considerations, which will emerge more clearly at the drafting stage, which alternative will be adopted;   but we must also take into account the risk that a cla,use intended
only to exempt railwaymen may invite very wide extensions during the progress of tho Bill in the House, and that Continental countries may find in it an excuse for making &quot;breaches in the conve-ntion which would &quot;be more serious in the case of productive industries than in that of railways.We should point out also that either alternative would result in exempting from the provisions of the Act, broadly speaking, only the employees of the Railway Companies employed on the railways.     5?hey would not exempt Railway employees engaged in road transport. Under the powers conferred on the railways last year, the number of their employees engaged upon the roads is increasing and agreements providing for substantially the same conditions as to hours for them as for the employees on the railways have recently been made by the Railway Unions.       A difficulty obviously arises because if the railway road employees are not exempted, different provisions as to hours will apply to the two separate classes of employees of the Railway Companies and if exemption %&amp;**&amp;mm%fa*b&amp;n ia extended to the railway employees on tho roads, complaint will no doubt be raised by other road transport interests.   -(b) Coal Mining.We understand that a separate Bill is in preparation and therefore we need make no proposals here in respect of underground workers, though our Bill will include surface-workers and miners not covered by the Coal Mines Acts.(c) Five-day week, cto.We propose the enactment of a daily limit of 8 hours with a general sanotion for 9 hours in certain circumstances and further, the granting to the Minister of labour of power to sanotion, (subject always to the normal weekly
1 c;7maximum of 48), arrangements permitting a longer normal working day where two complete days rest or more are given during the week.     It should be pointed out that at the time of the signing of the Washington Convention, the five-day week was little known and accordingly our proposal for sanctioning it may be regarded as an advance in the conditions as compared with those contemplated by the Convention. Averaging over a period.We propose that a wider power than that contemplated by the Convention should be given to the Minister of labour. Instead of averaging being only permissible in certain limited classes of employment and only then, if covered by an agreement, we propose that the Minister should be given power applicable to any trade not only to sanction agree-ments, but to make regulations in the last resort in default of agreement and also in oases where employers or workers are not organised, (e)   Overtime.We propose that, apart from the special provisions for preparatory or complementary work or for emergencies, there should be a wide permission to work overtime in oases of pressure of work, aubjeot to the payment of the overtime rate of wageo of at least 25$. 5.     A Bill on the above lines, though suited to the conditions of British induatry, maintaining its standards of conditions of work and, indeed, permitting some practices more favourable to the workpeople than a strict interpretation of the terms of the Convention, will not allow of immediate ratification of the Convention.     Nevertheless, it should have the support of those who genuinely desire to see a real solution of the hours problem and should help in smoothing out at Geneva the difficulties that remain.
6.6.     A decision by the Cabinet on the points raised above is necessary before the details of the Bill can be settled. Moreover, it is important for the Minister of Labour to get into consultation immediately with the Trades Union Congress and the Employers&apos; Confederation, as well as to discuss the details of the Bill with the other Government Departments which are concerned, and this cannot be done until the questions of principle are decided.We therefore recommend that the Committee be authorised to proceed on the lines proposed.MARGARS2!    G.    BONDFIELB. (Signed on behalf of the Committee).Ministry of Labour. 14th October, 1929.
