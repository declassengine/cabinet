9C /IIS DOCUMENT IS TliE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOvTOiMENT^ ,SECRET * Copy No.CP. 300(29).CABINET. TOWN PLANNING OF BUILT AREAS. Memorandum by Minister of Health.At present, town planning schemes can cover only land likely to be developed,   except that (a) land already built upon can be incidentally Included for efficiency and (b) limited schemes can be made for built areas of special historical, architectural or artistic interest.There has been much demand for the extension of town planning to built up areaB by general legislation. The Municipal Corporations Association have again passed a resolution asking for it.   The London County Council have asked for legislation.     Many bodies concerned with development have done the same.   Some towns have already obtained powers by Local Acts.    The late Minister of Health promised legislation at a favourable opportunity.   There is no question that the redevelopment of the already developed parts of towns, which is now taking place to so large an extent, should be carried out to a settled plan.Town Planning is also important for dealing with the slum problem because, when areas are cleared,  there should be ready a considered plan setting out how the oleared area can be used to the best advantage of the community and making sure that the redevelopment fits in with the plans for the town as a whole.I propose, therefore,  that the present limits on the kinds of land to which town planning may be applied shall be removed, and that the powers may be exercised for any lands , not only lands likely to be developed but built areas
and also lands where at present there may ba no livelihood of development;    The reasons for the inclusion of this last are:-,  (a) in practice it is not feasible nicely to distinguish between lands likely to be developed and those not so likely;    (b)  there is a demand (deserving of encouragement) from local authorities for the inclusion of some agricultural land as part of the general scheme of control (for instance, arrangements are on foot, even under existing powers, for restricting building development on the South Downs to specified areas and providing that the rest of the Downs shall be kept free from sporadic development);    (c) there is a strong and general demand for the use of planning powers for controlling rural development, so that amenities may be preserved.There are a number of respects in which the powers of Town Planning Authorities should be extended and I propose that they should be dealt with in the Bill. (1)    Because of the laborious work of preparation, along interval usually elapses between the time that a resolution to town-plan is passed and the final settlement of the scheme.    In the meantime, a man develops without the permission of the Local Authority at his peril, because he may be required to undo his development if it should conflict with the final scheme.     Generally,  therefore, owners do not develop without previous permission.   But it may not be right that the Local Authority should stop a proposed development,  even if contrary to what they want, without paying some compensation. At present they have no power to pay compensation
until the scheme had &quot;been finally approved. It is proposed to give them this power - which will be the more necessary how that town planning is to be extended to built areas*(2)    At present compensation cannot be claimed in respect of provisions which prescribe the character or height of buildings to be erected or the space about buildings or limit the number of buildings, eo far as the provisions are certified by the Minister of Health to be reasonable. I propose to extend this exclusion from compensation.In the first place, I propose expressly to cover user as well as character of buildings.   It is clearly right that, if a scheme provides for residential buildings in an area, it should be possible to prevent the use of a &quot;residential&quot; building as a shop, especially where a specified area has been allocated for shops.    It is open to some doubt whether this power now-exists.Secondly, I propose also to cover user of land, to a limited extent, such as its use for dog-racing or the use for residences of land subject to flooding.(3)    Thirdly, I think that a right should be given to the Town Planning Authority to declare what areas of land are to be open to general building development.   At present,  broadly speaking, an owner can build on any land.    If the Authority wish to stop building,  they have to pay compensation.One result is the sporadic and ribbon developmentof which there is so much complaint.To secure more orderly development, town planning Authorities might be empowered to declare whether
particular areas are or are not ripe for general &quot;building development, without being liable to pay compensation if their proposals are certified by the Minister of Health to be reasonable,(4)    Complaint is made that the value of, for instance, arterial roads is sometimes much reduced because too many side streets are made by private developers,  thus interrupting through traffic.   Local Authorities can now regulate this matter in town planning schemes, but subject to compensation.    So far as proposals of this kind can be certified as reasonable,  they should not, I think, be the subject of compensation.(5)    As regards matters for which compensation is payable,  claim can be made as soon as a scheme is finally approved and the local authority oan be required to pay as soon as tho amount is settled, even though the claim be in respeot of a restriction in the scheme which has not yet become effective.    For instance, a building line may be fixed to which any new building must be set back;    compensation may be claimed as soon as the restriction is fixed even though there may be no intention at the time of erecting a new building.This does not work out badly in undeveloped areas, because, by paying at once,  the local authority escapes the heavy increase in value of land which may arise as the land becomes more ripe for development;    The value of the land at the time may be low and (as often happens) no claim at all may be made in respect of the restriction.In already developed areas, however,  the position may be very different.    The local authority may refrain from fixing a highly desirable building line if they are liable to be confronted at once with many substantial
A*a v O.claims for compensation.      I propose to retain the present system but at the same time to give the local authority an option of not paying compensation until the restriction becomes effective - until, to follow the instance already given, an owner has actually to set back a new building which he Is erecting.     The local authority would then be liable to pay compensation on values as existing at that time.(6) Local authorities can now claim only one-half of betterment. I propose that they shall be empowered to claim the whole.(7) Betterment in any specific instance is not by any means always easy to prove, and the fighting costs of proving it may be out of all proportion to the result.      It is common knowledge that certain classes of improvement may add to the value of properties within a particular area.      It is right that the benefited owners should make a special contribution towards the improvement.     Local authorities might be empowered to claim that improvement charges shall be levied, on a specified area.     The provision of this power in respect of improvements carried out under a town planning scheme would serve to introduce a principle which should later be made of general application. (8)   The redevelopment of built areas may be seriously hindered in many cases,  If the land continues to be owned in small plots. There is a strong case for pooling of ownerships where required for proper redevelopment;    but any comprehensive * system of pooling presents many difficulties.    I think that we might go so far in the Bill as to empower the local authority to acquire and redistribute separately-owned plots where a fair redistribution can be shown to be practicable and necessary to ensure proper redevelopment,
w *J oincluding power compulsorily to acquire lanr! on behalf of a majority of owners where there is a minority which stands &quot;in the way.     This wouV be a novel principle which may cau&amp;e considerable controversy. (9) At present, Town Planning Authorities are required to ascertain, and to issue an individual notice to   each owner of land, in the area for which a scheme is being prepared.     This is an onerous obligation, and. local authorities have pressed, that adequate public notice should be sufficient;Now that town planning is becoming so much a normal incident of local government, like byelaws, I think that public notice should be enough, but that ?/e should, couple with this an obligation individually to notify each owner who has registered himself with the local authority for this purpose.The ooints above mentioned are the principal matters requiring to be dealt with by legislation - there are also some minor points with which I need not trouble my colleagues.    Before finally deciding tire lines on which the amending legislation is to be drawn I propose to consult the local authorities and other interests concerned, but before doing so, I should wish to be assured, of the general concurrence of. tho Cabinet in my views as above expressed.I should add a reference to the question of appeals.It is unavoidable that a right of appeal shall be given from the decision of the local authority in many town planning matters.      At present,  the right of appeal is to the Minister, and there is much to be said for this course. But as town planning extends this work may become very heavy, and there is much other work of the same kind falling on the Ministry and. making heavy calls on the staff.
I should be glad either (a)  if all appeals could go to the Courts of Summary Jurisdiction, with an appeal to Quarter Sessions, or (b) if power could be given to the Minister of Health, with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor, to prescribe that all appeals or   specified classes of appeals shall be determined by those Courts, This question of appeals I should also propose to explore in consultation with the local authorities and other interests concerned.(Initialled)   A.G.1st November, 1929. Ministry of Health.
