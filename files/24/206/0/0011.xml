DOCUMENT 13 THE  PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GQV3RMKEN T).,,.C R S T. 261 (29 f.COPY NOCABINET.THE RELATIONS J)F THE PROPOSED BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS rlTlT THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS&apos; &quot;AND V:iTH THEHer-iorandu.n\ by trie Chancellor cf the Exchequer-.Proposals have been made that some relationship should Irt established between the Bank of International Settlements, proposed to be set up under the Report cf the Young Committee and the Hague Protocol of August 31st-,  1929,  and the League of Nations.      This matter was brought privately to the attention of the Prime Minister by Sir Arthur Salter, Director of the Economic and Financial Organisation of the League, at the beginning of this month,  and was later raised in a Resolution (since withdrawn) ?Jhich the Danish, Norwegian and Polish Delegations submitted to the Assembly of the League expressing &quot;the hope that the provisions setting up the Bank will be framed with due regard to the general principle laid down and enjoined upon the League members in the Covenant, and that arrangements will be made to establish an appropriate relationship, with such consultations as may be desirable for the purpose, which will take due account of the general public and -sorld interests which are involved&quot;.2. A-lthough Article 24 of the Covenant hardly applies in terms, there might theoretically be something tc be said in favour of -creating seme association between the League and*f    The allusion is to Article 24 of the Covenant which provides that &quot;All ...  International Bureaux and all Commissions for the regulation of matters of Inter-national Interest hereafter constituted shall be placed under the direction of the League.&quot;
the Bank for International Settlements if only because questions which the two organisations are dealing with may possibly (at least at some  future date) impinge0      I have no rigid views on the theoretical side of this question; buti,, on the practical side it seems clear that there would be the greatest difficulty in securing general acceptance for any such arrangement.      It must be remembered that in the earlier stages the Bank will be primarily concerned with reparations and one of the main objectives of the Young Committee in proposing its establishment was to ensure that the administration of reparations should in future be dealt with purely as a business matter and divorced from political considerations.      If any opportunity is given for the exertion through the League of Nations of political influence on the Bank (such as would be only too likely if the Bank&apos;s operations were the subject of an annual debate in the League Assembly) this object would be defeated and for this reason the German Government is likely to continue strongly opposed to any association between the Bank and the League. Furthermore,  any attempt at the present time to create an association between the Bank and the League v.;ould almost certainly involve the withdrawal of American Bankers from the unofficial co-operation with the Bank for International Settlements which is at present  contemplated.      The withdrawal of American participation would be fatal to the well balanced organisation of the Bank in regard to reparations and debts and would prevent all possibility;/- of the progressive development of those 7/ider aims which it is hoped that the Bank may eventually realise in international finance.      Any association
C 0 36&quot;between the League and the Bank must,  In my opinion, be-left to grow naturally out of the normal activities of the two bodies and not be forced upon either of them, 3c      In these circumstances, after consulting the Prime Minister, I sent the following telegram to the Secretary of State at Geneva on the 18th Instant;-&quot;The Young Plan proposed and the Hague Conference approved the appointment of an Organisation Coramitte to draft the constitution of this Ban ,     This Organisation Committee is abovtt to meet, and its proposal.s will be submitted in due course to the adjourned Hague Conference.     Any intervention by th League at the present stage is in my view premature and might have very unfortunate consequences.      I trust that y.&quot;*u will concert with the Delegations of the other five Hague inviting Powers,  i.e., France, Belgium, Italy, Japan and Germany, in order to secure the withdrawal or rejection of any Resolution tending towards League intervention.&quot; It transpired that the views expressed in this telegram were shared by all the principal Governments concerned with the Bank ana the Resolution        accordingly withdrawn.4.      There is a further aspect of the proposed Bank which also requires consideration and that is its relations with the Governments of the countries whose Central Banks &quot;are to be represented on the  Board of the new institution.The Bank project in the Young plan, If adopted literally, might have had the effect of creating a financial autocracy Inasmuch as the aankf3 constitution would, on a strict reading of the reccmmendations, n*t be
subject t-i any revision unless the Directors themselves so decided.The danger of an irresponsible autocracy of such a kind need net of course be exaggerated, because clearly an ultimate?&apos; power of revision must be inherent In the Governments by whoso authority or consent the central Banks exercise their functions, including the function of participating in the management of the Bank for International settlements. Nevertheless it Is I think desirable that provision should be included in the final document for revision of the constitution at reasonable intervals and for the approval by the Governments of such amendments, if any, as experience may show to be desirable.      Provision for this purpose could convenience-ently-be made by the organisation Committee for the Bank which is about to meet and which has to prepare detailed proposals for giving effect to the Bank project, for submission t^ the adjourned Hague Conference.      I have been in touch with the British members of the -Organisation Committee - Sir Charles Addis and Mr. Y/.T. Layton - and I understand that they are fully alive to this aspect       the question, which I propose to watch closely as matters develop^It will be appreciated of course that the foregoing remarks aro not intended to imply that the regular banking;business of the new Banks 3hould in any way be subject to political pressure or^intervention.(Intd.)
