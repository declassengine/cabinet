[This Bocament i&amp; the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1929.SECRET.Copy No.35CP. 283 (29).CABINET.CONFERENCE ON THE  OPERATION OF DOMINION LEGISLATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THE Conference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation has now made a preliminary survey of all the important subjects before it, with the exception of merchant shipping.The main subjects, apart from merchant shipping, which arise under the terms of reference, are as follows : The authorities now responsible for tendering advice to His Majesty in respect of reserved Dominion Bills or the disallowance of Dominion Statutes are His Majesty&apos;s Ministers in the United Kingdom. Whilst the discussions on this subject at the Conference have been so far of a tentative character, general agreement has been reached on the basis that it will be desirable to make it clear, in some suitable way, that the present position as regards both disallowance and&quot; reservation is not in accordance with modern constitutional developments. A proviso will, however, be necessary in order to make it clear that the power of disallowance still remains intact in respect of Dominion legislation which may affect adversely the position of holders of Dominion stocks which have been admitted to the Trustee List in this country. This proviso, with which it is understood that the Dominions concerned concur, is necessary in consequence of the fact that acceptance of the right of disallowance of Dominion legislation of this character is one of the conditions imposed under the Regulations made under the Colonial Stock Act of 1900.The position now is that, except for certain limited powers conferred by the Commonwealth Constitution Act, the Dominions have no express power to give extra-territorial operation to their legislation, though the extent to which Dominion legislation can, in fact, operate beyond the limits of the Dominion is a subject on which there is considerable conflict of legal opinion, and, indeed, of judicial authority. The discussions at the conference have been proceeding on the basis that there is no objection to the extension of the powers of Dominion legislatures, so that they may be able hence-forward to make laws with extra-territorial effect, subject to the proviso that no such legislation shall, by reason only of the power now to be conferred, be entitled to claim recognition in any court in any other part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions.An exception (which has not yet been discussed) will presumably have to be made so as to make it clear that the power to legislate with extra-territorial effect will not extend, without consent&quot;, to British ships, other than those registered in the Dominion itself, when&apos;outside the territorial waters of that Dominion. This matter is further mentioned in head (e) of this memorandum and the notes accompanying it.(1.) Disallowance and Reservation of Dominion Legislation.(2.) Extra-Territorial Effect for Dominion Legislation.[20031]b
(3.) Operation of the Colonial Laws Validity Act.In effect, this Act provides that any Dominion legislation which is repugnant to an Imperial Act applying to that Dominion, is void to the extent of such repugnancy.Since there are a large number of Imperial Statutes which apply throughout the Dominions, this Act constitutes a very real fetter on the present legislative powers of Dominion Parliaments.An examination of the Imperial Acts in question shows that they may be roughly grouped under three heads : (1.) Laws respecting matters with regard to which special provisions forsecuring uniformity are unnecessary. (2.) Laws respecting matters in which uniformity and general applicabilitythroughout  the  Commonwealth  are  very  desirable on  grounds of convenience.(3.) Laws fundamental to the structure of the British Commonwealth.No difficulty arises as to statutes falling within the first of these groups. It seems clear that the matters involved may very appropriately be left for the Dominion legislatures to deal with in future, should they so desire.As regards Group 2, it is admitted that the subjects included are matters in which uniformity of legislation is, for practical reasons, very desirable. But on account, in the main, of political necessities, it seems best to agree to put these subjects within the legislative competence of the Dominion Parliaments with the reasonable expectation that uniformity will be continued by the method of consulta-tion and agreement.The real difficulty arises with regard to matters falling under Group 3. These deal with questions of fundamental importance, and it is in connection mainly with this group that certain points have arisen which the Attorney-General and I think it necessary, at the present stage, to bring before the Cabinet.(a.) Legislation with regard to the Crown.In his opening speech at the Conference, the Attorney-General took the view that divergence of legislation with regard to the Crown would automatically put an end to the British Commonwealth as an organic whole, and that even the possibility of divergence would endanger it. In accordance with this view (which, I under -stand, is that held by the Cabinet), the Attorney-General put forward the suggestion at a recent meeting of the Conference that the existing law on this subject (which, of course, extends throughout the Empire) should be maintained with the existing safeguards, and that it should be positively enacted that, if and when any necessity for alteration should arise, there should be no change without the prior assent of every member of the Commonwealth (including, of course, the United Kingdom).From a private conversation with the Heads of all the delegations, the Attorney-General and I believe that a provision of this kind would be agreed to (unless the Dominion Governments, who are being consulted by telegraph, should raise objection within the next few days), but nothing else.There is no desire or, at any rate, no expressed desire to treat existing legislation relating to the Sovereign and the succession to the Throne as other than fundamental. The attitude taken up by some of the Dominions is due to political reasons (and mainly with the idea of carrying the doctrine of equality of status laid down at the Imperial Conference of 1926 to its complete logical conclusion).(b.) Certain Aspects of Defence Legislation.The Attorney-General, in his opening speech at the Conference, proposed in accordance with the express wish of the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry  that there should be special protection for the Disciplinary Code of Imperial Forces operating in any part of the Empire, so far as their internal discipline was concerned. What is necessary is to ensure that in all parts of His Majesty&apos;s dominions the armed forces of any part of the British Commonwealth should carry with them their own code of internal discipline, as enacted by their own Legislature, and to that extent should not be subject to local law.The discussions which have so far taken place at the Conference have indicated that, while there is no objection whatever to this principle, there is considerable objection to a mere continuance of the existing legal situation.
We believe that a clause to the following effect in the Imperial Act which will be necessary to give effect to the recommendations of the Conference, would be acceptable &quot;It is declared that, unless and until all the members of the British Commonwealth otherwise agree, the armed forces of each member wherever they may be shall be subject, so far as internal discipline is concerned, exclusively to^the Municipal Law of that member.&quot;If a clause on these lines is acceptable, it will be necessary to discuss at the Conference (and I should be glad to have the opinion of the Cabinet on the point) whether it should be made beyond the competence of a Dominion Parliament to repeal or amend the clause, or whether the declaration should be left to be its own safeguard.(c.) The Law of Prize.Hitherto the position has been that Prize Law throughout the Empire has been regulated by and under legislation of the Parliament at Westminster. In other words, uniformity is secured by the fact that the manner in which jurisdiction is conferred on Prize Courts in the Dominions, and the law which those Courts administer, are dealt with in Imperial Statutes, or by the Crown on the advice of Ministers in the United Kingdom, and cannot, therefore, be altered by a Dominion Legislature or Executive.The view held by the Admiralty is that if the Empire in time of war is to be regarded as a single belligerent, it is essential that there should be one uniform code of Prize Law operating throughout its constituent members.The discussions which have so far taken place at the Conference indicate that there is considerable sympathy with the view (which has been put forward by the Attorney-General and by Sir Maurice Gwyer as Procurator-General) that uniformity of Prize Law and Prize procedure throughout the Empire is essential. There has, however, been considerable opposition to the suggestion that this uniformity should be henceforth secured under an Act of the Imperial Parliament applicable to the whole Commonwealth. Moreover, it may well be contended that the present time is not appropriate for discussion of any change whatever, since the whole question of belligerent rights is likely to be the subject of international discussion in the not distant future.It seems possible that, for the time being, this question could be dealt with on the following lines, viz., by securing an agreement to the effect that no change in the existing law or practice should be made except with the consent of all the Members of the Commonwealth.(d.) Suggested Empire Court.There is another matter, to which I ought also to call attention, which has already had preliminary discussion by the Cabinet and has a very considerable bear-ing on the matters touched on above.At various points, in the course of the proceedings of the Conference, Dominion delegates have adumbrated the idea of setting up a new Court for the British Commonwealth as a whole; and the opinion has been expressed that such a Court might enable various of the difficulties encountered to be surmounted. Thus the necessary uniformity in the interpretation by various Courts of the Law of Prize might be secured by the establishment of an Empire High Court which could be used as a Court of Appeal. The virtual necessity for such a Court to determine disputes between the various Governments of the -Commonwealth brought into prominence by the reservations to the Optional Clause has been repeatedly alluded to. The Attorney-General and I have carefully abstained from committing ourselves to the proposition; but we feel that its adoption would generally conduce to obtaining a unanimous report on all the subjects that the Conference is considering, and that the establishment of such a Court would be a great achievement. It appears to us from the discussions that it would be indispensable to its acceptance (1) that the establish-ment of the Court should be declared to arise at the desire of the Dominions as well as of the United Kingdom; (2) that the panel of judges should be nominated by all the members of the Commonwealth; and (3) that the functions and jurisdiction of the Court should be only such as may be agreed upon. If agreement were reached on these lines, we believe that a clause establishing the Court by Imperial Act would not be objected to.  The discussions are still proceeding.[20031] b 2
We realise, of course, that the position of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and its relation to the proposed new Court, would require careful consideration.(e.) Merchant Shipping.Lastly, I ought to direct the attention of the Cabinet to the main points which seem likely to cause difficulty when the subject of Merchant Shipping legislation * comes to be discussed. In accordance with the procedure agreed to at a recent meeting of the Cabinet Committee set up to assist the United Kingdom repre-sentatives at the present Conference, it is proposed to lay special stress on the following proposals : (1.) That the definition of &quot;British ship,&quot; whatever form that definition may take, should, in principle, be included as one of those matters which can only be altered by the consent of all parts of the Commonwealth;(2.) That each part of the Commonwealth should agree that it will not legislate extra-territorially with regard to ships registered in another part without the consent of that part;(3.) That the law of the country of registration should prevail as regards the internal discipline and economy of the ship;(4.) That within each jurisdiction all British ships should be treated alike, and should be given national and most-favoured-nation treatment.These matters are more fully explained in the notes, approved by the President of the Board of Trade, which form an Appendix to the present memorandum. The third and fourth points seem likely to cause most difficulty, particularly the fourth, which raises the question of the power of a Dominion to reserve its own coasting trade to its own registered ships.I should be glad to have the views of the Cabinet as to the lines on which we should proceed in relation to the five matters more particularly discussed in this memorandum..p.Dominions Office, October 18, 1929.
APPENDIX.Notes as to Merchant Shipping. j. (1.) Definition of British Ship.IF alteration were possible without consent, each part of the Commonwealth would be able to alter the qualifications for owning a British ship without the consent of the others, and the term &quot; British ship &quot; would cease to have its present meaning. If the departures from the present system were at all serious, there would be uncertainty as to the status of the ships.(2.) Extra-territoriality.The proposal that no part of the Empire should legislate extra-territorially with regard to ships registered in another part without the consent of that part represents the practice followed by the United Kingdom for the last nineteen years, and we are only asking the Dominions to do what we are doing now. There would clearly not be equality if the Dominions exercised a right to legislate for our ships on the high seas while we bound ourselves not to exercise our right to legislate for theirs.At present, whether the Dominions have, or have not, in law the right to legislate for United Kingdom ships on the high seas, in practice this right has not been exercised without our consent, and it would cause the gravest misgiving in the minds of shipowners if they found, as the outcome of this Conference, that their ships on the high seas were to be subjected for the first time to Dominion legislation, while foreign ships were not, in fact, subject to this liability and the United Kingdom could impose no such liability on Dominion ships.All we are asking is that as the extra-territorial rights of the various parts of the Commonwealth are now being placed on a definite basis, there should at the same time be established by agreement a comity of nations within the Commonwealth.(3.) Internal Discipline and Economy.The proposal that the law of the country of registration should prevail as regards the internal discipline and economy of the ship covers such matters as the relations between masters and seamen and discipline on board, and at present the law on these subjects is practically the same for all British ships, this uniformity being secured by the existing law. Under the new regime each part would be free to make its own law on these subjects, and no difficulty would arise unless they tried to enforce that law on ships belonging to another part when within their jurisdiction.The United States have passed Acts to the effect that advances and allotments of wages given under British law, which are perfectly valid under British law, shall cease to be valid when a British ship enters an American port, and that the seaman can claim his full wages irrespective of advances or allotments that have been paid to him or on his behalf. This power to interfere with the internal economy of a foreign ship in American ports has not been fully exercised yet and is still before the United States Courts, but if it were fully exercised it would cause great confusion and be detrimental to the seamen and their families, for no owner would be willing in these circumstances either to give advances to the men themselves or allotments of wages to their families.In this country we do not in fact interfere with the internal economy or discipline of foreign ships, and it would be quite easy for us to agree to do the same thing with regard to Dominion ships. It would be reasonable that all of us should exercise the same restraint with regard to each other.(4.) National and Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment.The proposal that within each jurisdiction all British ships shall be treated alike and shall be given national and most-favoured-nation treatment is the point that may promote most discussion, as India certainly, and Canada possibly, want
to differentiate between ships registered at their ports and other British ships. They may say that they must have the right to develop their own Mercantile Marine by any means they think fit, and for this purpose use powers which are in fact used by some foreign countries. They may also say that this is an economic point and should not be discussed by a Conference on law.The answer is that the present law, Section 736 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, which gives power to British possessions to regulate their coasting trade, lays down definitely that all British ships shall be treated in exactly the same manner, and it would be unwise to agree to make this alteration in the law without con-sidering what the economic effects may be.If India and Canada do differentiate in favour of ships registered in their ports or owned by their own nationals as against other British ships, and all the other parts of the Commonwealth follow suit, British ships will be split up into seven different classes, and there will be an antithesis between the ships registered in one part and the ships registered in other parts which does not exist at present.Since the war we have had the utmost difficulty in resisting attempts by foreign Governments to differentiate in their own trades in favour of their own ships, and where we have been successful our success has been due to the feeling that, if matters were pushed beyond a certain point, the British Empire would act together and would resist the aggression. Italy has shut the Cunard and White Star out of the Atlantic trade from Italy, and was proceeding to cut down the Orient trade from Italy to Australia in favour of Italian ships. With the help of India and Australia it has been possible to induce the Italians to come to a satisfactory arrangement, but if British ships are split into classes, it would be much more difficult for any one part to resist aggression of this kind, and as we do not know from what quarter aggression may come next, it is desirable in the interest of all of us that we should stand together.This does not mean that each part would not be able to regulate its own local trade in any way it thought fit. Australia, for instance, has for years laid down special conditions as to wages, crews&apos; quarters, &amp;c, on all ships in the Australian coasting trade, but this law made no differentiation between Australian and other British ships.o
