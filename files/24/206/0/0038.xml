THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY     GOVERNMENT) .L1.LIL1?.&apos;THEJ70LUNTaRY SCHOOL PROBLEM,ECRET. Copy Ho o,Po 290/29 0MJ^^^J^^y ..^lJ)^SJ^m!r. Of thg. BOARD OP BDUCATIONtt We have got to &quot;be prepared for a determined move on &quot;behalf of Catholic hierarchy to obtain financial aid towards the building of Catholic Schoolsc      In all probability I shall be subject to considerable questioning and possible attack as soon as the Session opens9My colleagues will remember the situation.   Before the Election began the Catholic hierarchy made a definite move to extract promises from all candidates in favour of State aid for the building of Catholic Schools.     A Committee of the Party considered the matter beforehand and sent rdund recommendations to Labour Candidates advising them not to give any specific pledges but that they&quot;should make it clear to all concerned that the proposals made by the Catholics involve the re-opening of the settle-ment of 1902, and that any revision of the terms of that settlement, whether by way of greater denominational facilities or increased financial assistance,  can only be considered subsequent to a conference representative of the Board of Education, the Local Ed.ucafcion Authorities and the various religious interests affected6Undoubtedly if a Labour Government were to be elected the Minister of Education would facilitate the summoning of such a Conference,  if requested, and would only act, either by legislation or regulation, af fcer agreement had been reached&quot;0
our 0u &amp;In spite of this a good many of^/candi dates went a long way towards promising what the Catholios demanded.     Since we took office t have made one reply to questions on the subject, asfollows&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government is aware of the demand put forward by some of the Catholio community for building grants towards Catholio Schools.     The subject is part of a much larger one, namely, the position of the non-provided sohools, as regulated by the compromise bf 1902, The position of His Majesty1s Government is that if the arrangement of 1902 is to be varied it can only be after some general agreement has been reached among all the main interests concerned.&quot;I have as yet received no communication from responsible Catholic quarters asking for the calling of a Conference such as we might be prepared to contemplate.     But I have just got a request for an interview from a responsible Committee, whom I must of course meet.I have no reason to think that at present at any rate the leaders of the Church of England are anxious to raise the whole question.     The Archbishop of Canterbury in an appeal for funds for Church Schools on October 16th gave not the slightest indication that the Church wished to re-open the main question. In regard to,the reorganisation at   present proceeding in order to implement the Hadow report and the raising of the school age, he said, the Church could, he thought &quot;adapt some of their existing schools in the towns, and they could, with the encouragement of the education authorities group together some of their country schools and equip one of them as a higher top school, as the phrase went.      In that and in other ways, they could make themselves a very real and, he hoped, eager-hearted partner with the local authority.&quot;      I should however mention that the Archbishop1s Commission on religious education has not yet issued its report,  though publication is expected very shortly.
Then with regard to the free Churches.      They are &quot;beginning to show serious anxiety lost we should hold out any hopes to the Catholics of giving &quot;building grants.Hone of us protends to be satisfied with the existing dual system.      it has all the disadvantages of a compromise,.     On the other hand it has saved our country for a quarter of a century from bitter religious antagonism in the region of education.      I,  therefore,, suggest that we should resist any breach in it until we are absolutely certain that we can get an agreed settlement on other lines.It is absolutely impossible- to separate the Catholic case from the general case of voluntary schools, If we allow a Catholic priest to get public money to build his schools we have to concede the same to every Church of England parson in the land.It is quite impossible to alter the positipn withoutsecuring that the monopoly of tho Church of England of-ji-..&apos;.,&apos;^&quot;&apos;&quot;elementary education in 5,000 single(areas shall be in some way terminated.If we were to break the compromi.se of 1902 and give public money for building denominational schools we should have a vory large section of our party, and the whole of the Liberal Party furiously antagonisticIf on the other hand we brought forward any proposals for larger public control of voluntary schools, anything in tho nature of the Scottish settlement or otherwise, we should antagonise the Catholics and the advanced Church people and the fate of our legislation, however reasonable, would no doubt be the same as that of the Liberal legislation in 190S when the House of Lords rejected their proposals,I,  therefore,  propose to adhere to our present position and to reply to all pressure that the Labour
Government are unable to undertake to alter the settlement of 1902 until the main parties interested have come to some sort of agreement, and that it is impossible to suggest a partial alteration of the existing system unless the whole policy is agreed upon;    that the experience of the last 25 years has freed educational progress from the bitterness of the religious controversy which marked the preceding decade;, that the dual system has however caused great difficulties and complications for educational administrators, while it has failed to satisfy the ardent denominationalists or those who want complete public control;    that the situation is perhaps one where the good sense and absence of religious bitterness of the present moment might lead to the evolving of some agreed solution;    and that if the Government were approached by representatives of any of the main parties concerned they would do their best to see whether an authoritative national conference could be brought together in the hopes of finding a solution.25th October,  1929.
