GSgSBR&amp;X STOPPAGE OF 1926.__POSITION OP established a.TOLTRALTY EMPLOYEES WHO TOOK PART.MSMORAKPUlvI BY THE (51AIICBLLCR 0? THE EXCHEQUER.Sir &quot;Warren Fisher rs Memorandum puts the legal -view and the Treasury obligation in the matter of certifying fidelity of service before a full pension can be give no        In these cases,  even after the lapse of many years it will bo difficult for the Treasury to certify continuous fidelity.      But against this it may be said that the late Government condoned the act of striking in the cases of the men who returned to work on being warned, and also to aome extent in the cases of the men now under consideration by re-instating them with, a penalty.      The two points which weigh with me are    (1) was this penalty excessive?    (2) were the circumstances of the strike so exceptional as to deserve more considerate treatment than if the men had struck becar.se of some grievance of their own?It is a matter of * opinion whether if the penalty is removQG the men will regard it as a condonation of their action and an encouragement to do the same again or whether it will be a warning.-        I am inclined to agree with Sir Warren wisher that the remission will tend to loosen their feelings of obligation to conform to their terms of service.The point in the Pirst iGrd^ statement that tke men wereTTpenalisea&apos;T by losing their wages during the time they were on strike is surely a misuse of words.      It   cannot be intended that they should be paid when on strike.
^7*J bThe seriousness of the menTs action is that they refused to go-hack when the gravity of their offence was pointed out.      It often happens in the Civil Service that a person is degraded or deprived of promotion for a less serious offence involving far heavier loss of pension.The difficulty of remitting these penalties is mainly that it will have serious repercussions.      It will raise the penalties inflicted on the post office strikers and the Police strikers and also the innumerable cases where Civil Servants have forfeited some part of their pensions through some nisconduet.On the whole I think it would be dangerous if the request to remit the penalties in the cases under consideration was conceded.Po.Sc23rd September, 1929.
MEMORANDUM  BY S IE  WARREN  FISHER.In-a-memarau^uE to the Cabinet dated 19th September(CP.  248/29), the Hirst Lord of the Admiralty recommendscancellation of the penalties imposed on certain establishedemployees who took part in the general stoppage of 1926.The First Lord does not deny the force of representations which have been made to him that &quot;it is in the interestsof all Governments alike, whatever their political sympathies,that they should be able to rely with as much confidence ontheir established civilian employees as on tho officers-*     and men of the Fighting Services to carry on their duties,whatever the circumstances.&quot;     He proposes, therefore, that&quot;if the Cabinet should decide to r en it the penalties, thisshould not be acne on any ground that might be held to imply a general admission of the right of established,.employees of the State to go on strike, nor any condonationof the action of these particular men who have alreadybeen declared by the officials of their Unions te have actedwrongly.    The penalties could,&quot; he suggests,  &quot; be remittedpurely as an act of grace with the object of -removing a widely felt sense of grievance for what is felt to havebeen an unduly harsh decision1&apos;.This proposal is open to grave objection.Once it is accepted that t&quot;c first duty of H.1.1. Government is to safeguard the existence t-f the community, and that in order effectively to discharge this duty, the Government must at all tirr.es be able to count on the loyal support of the civilian and military employees of the State who are the instruments through which it o;.crates,  it is surely beyond question that the offence of striking Is the most serious offence against Government that a civil servant V could com-iit and the last offence which any Government mindful of its responsibility to the community, would lightly condone. ..3,.i .________
Consistently with this view, perl ifmoat has sanctioned the gra^t of pensions to civil servants on the condition that they shall have rendered faithful and satisfactory service,  and has in express terns decreed that it is unlawful for the Treasury to award the full rate of pension to a civil servant who cannot, when he retires, he certified to have served throughout his career with diligence and fidelity,,It is not disputed either th-.;t these established employees of the admiralty broke faith with His Majesty:s Government or that they did so knowingly., Tboy ucre given a cle-&apos; r warning of the consequences of their action but still refused to return to duty. On those established employees who returned to their duty i. fter being warned ox the consequences of their action, no penalty hi s been imposed.,The raeii who persisted in their wrong doing arc to lose periods of service  (otherwise rockonable for pension) varying from two to four years-    How can it be argued that the punishment inflicted on those men is &quot;unduly harsh&quot;?      They hewart * in fact been treated far less sevaroJy than the police strikers who in 1919 were dismissed from the Service and have lost tno whole of their pension,, And the penalty of     ten pp.r cent deduction from pension  (or of the loss of all pre-strike service for pension purposes) is still beinv liposed on the post office workers who vent- on strike in 1890*
It should perhaps he added that the penalty has so far been exacted in only one case, and that -the  case of r. man who retired of his own motion at the age of 60 when he might,  if ho had so chosen, have served for five more years,  all reckonable towards increase of pens ion;    and that in the ordinary course no further case will arise until November 1933 at the earliest, when the youngest of the men still remaining in the service will reach the rgr of 60.N.P.h.F.Treasury Chambers,24th  September,  1929.
