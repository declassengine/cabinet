[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1029.CONFIDENTIAL.Copy No.    3SCP. 302 (29).CABINET.THE  PROVISION  OF  AN AERODROME  ABOVE  THE  NEW CHARING CROSS RAILWAY STATION.Note by the Secretary of State for Air.AT the request of the Lord Privy Seal and the Minister of Transport, I circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a memorandum which has been prepared by the Air Ministry in conjunction with the Ministry of Transport on a project for the provision of an aerodrome above the new Charing Cross railway station.I should like to have the views of the Cabinet on this project at an early date for the reason given in the last paragraph of the memorandum.Air Ministry, October 24, 1929.Memorandum prepared by the Air Ministry in conjunction with the&apos; Ministry of Transport. - .One of the most serious handicaps of Air Transport operating over comparatively short distances, such as those between London and our great cities in the north, is the amount of time expended in reaching Croydon Airport.To make certain of arriving at Croydon in sufficient time for any scheduled air service, a, start from Whitehall 45 minutes before the time of departure of the aircraft is necessary. Other cities are more favoured; the airport of Hull is 15 minutes from the centre of the city, and that of Manchester 20 minutes.A journey to Manchester, therefore, involves the following times : that is, the car journeys between city and airport total more than one-third of the total time necessary for the journey.During 1923 the Civil Aviation Advisory Board made searching investigations ; with a view to discovering some more convenient site than Croydon for the. Airport of London, and presented a Report (Cmd. 1816) but no such site could be found.   Proposals were made at the time that it might be possible to roof over one of the big railway termini or a portion of the River Thames, but these were negatived as being too costly.The establishment of a new Charing Cross Station on the south bank of the Thames affords an opportunity of reviving the question, and it seems possible that the project of providing an aerodrome on the roof of the new station could be carried through without very serious extra expense.It is difficult to state exactly the size and strength required in such an aerodrome.T.Whitehall to Croydon ....

Aeronautical design is progressing rapidly; this advance, on the one hand, is tending to render the area necessary for operation smaller, whilst, on the other hand, the size and weight of aircraft are increasing.The ideal would be an aerodrome of 800 yards diameter capable of carrying aircraft of 20 tons weight; but this is probably too comprehensive a demand from the point of view of cost.A suitable area would be a circle of at least 400 yards diameter. This estimate is based on the assumption that by the time any aerodrome of this type could be constructed, certain accelerating and decelerating devices will have been perfected. It should be capable of carrying an aircraft weighing up-to 20,000 lbs. which would probably involve an impact weight of 60,000 lbs. on landing. If this demand was found to be prohibitive from the architectural point of view, it could be reduced. But such a reduction would limit the aerodrome to the use of small aircraft only.The height of the aerodrome surface should be at least equal to that of any obstruction situated within 600 yards of the outer circumference of the landing surface.The landing surface would probably need to fall slightly in every direction from the centre so as to provide for drainage. There would be no objection to the provision of gratings for the admission of light and air to the space below the landing surface, if these gratings could be made sufficiently strong.It is realized, of course, that a complete circular surface may not be attainable; the exact shape of the landing place could be modified to meet existing conditions, and details can only be settled by discussion with the architects and other authorities concerned.Lifts outside the landing area, and housing accommodation below it, will be desirable for the handling of aircraft after arrival. If this proved impracticable, the aerodrome could be utilized solely for picking up and putting down passengers and freight, the aircraft being maintained and housed in existing aerodromes outside the city.It is suggested that the Southern Railway Company might be asked to consider in planning their new station the provision of an aerodrome on the lines indicated. It would, of course, be unfortunate if such a suggestion were to lead to any delay in carrying out the general scheme of improvement, in connection with the new Bridge, on the southern side of the river, and this possibility must be borne in mind. It must also be expected that the Southern Railway Company, if they find that the Government presses the proposal, and if they are themselves prepared to contemplate the provision of an aerodrome, will seek some financial assistance from the Government, presumably by an application under the Development Act, 1929.Apart from these considerations, it is possible that such a proposal will evoke a good deal of public criticism from the point of view of the danger and noise which a. concentration of aircraft at this point might be alleged to involve. Experience goes to prove that the danger involved, even under present conditions, would be very small; in three years&apos; time, aircraft will be even more reliable than they arem to-day, and regulations and certain restrictions could increase this standard of safety still further. With regard to noise, steady progress towards the silencing of aircraft is being made. But before the Departments concerned approach the Southern Railway, it is desired to know that the Cabinet generally are disposed to favour the project.An early decision . is desirable in case any alteration to the plans to be deposited in connection with the Charing Cross Bridge Scheme is entailed.Air Ministry, October 23, 1929.
