HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT.281(29).    ^ Copy No.   4 3CABINET. TRADE OUTLOOK. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate for the information of the Cabinet the minutes of the October meeting of the Board of Trade Advisory Council dealing with the state of trade in September.    The Lord Privy Seal attended the meeting and gave an account of the steps he was taking to further employment with special reference to his visit to Canada.There was a considerable drop in exports of coal In August from the figure reached in July (the best month of the year), but some recovery in September.     The exports for the nine months this year exceed those for the same period last year by seven million tons.     There appears to be a gradual expansion of consumption on the Continent and the prospects for our export trade are fairly good.The iron and steel industry has not maintained the improve-ment promised earlier in the year;    Continental competition is again strengthening and prices of foreign steel are below British prices.     The tin-plate industry is comparatively prosperous. There is no marked change to report in the engineering, ship-building, electrical and motor industries.As regards Cotton, the export trade to the East was reported as very depressed   though there is some Improvement in the trade with India and South America.     Other cotton manufacturing countries, with the exception of Japan, seem to be sharing our difficulties.     The situation in the woollen industry is over-shadowed at the moment by the wages question.
As regards trade generally, a favourable sign is to be found in the railway receipts for ordinary merchandise and for coal, which are greater than last year, and are increasing.W.G.Board of Trade, 23rd. October, 1929.

CONFIDENTIAL.UNEMPLOYMENT AND TRADE WITH CANADA - STATEMENT BY --TO&apos;LORD PftlVt SEAT:--&quot;&quot;&quot;THE PRESIDENT informed the Council that the Lord Privy Seal had come to their meeting to address them briefly on his recent visit to Canada, and on certain questions connected with unemployment In this country, and to ask for their co-operation and help.     After his address, Mr. Thomas would be prepared to answer questions.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL welcomed the opportunity of addressing the Council for two reasons.     The first was that, being responsible for dealing with the unemployment problem, he wanted to tell the members how It was being tackled, and secondly because he would welcome any help or suggestions they oould give.    Many quite responsible people assumed that by   -merely spending money the unemployment evil oould be endeavoured, but he had never hesitated, before the election and after he was in office, to say publicly that there was   no short cut and no immediate cure, and that in the end the raising of the general level of industrial efficiency leading to greater trade prosperity was the only solution of the problem.    It was towards that end that ho was directing his efforts.At home, whatever might be said of road schemes and playing fields, they were not remunerative.      They gave work tomporarily, but at the end the same diffioulty had to bo faced.     Ho had, therefore, resolved that, if public money was to be spent, it should only be spent in the direction of improving the general Industrial efficiency of the country, that is to say by Improving the railways, docks, harbours and power services, so that any improvement of trade which might oome would find us better equipped to meet it.    For that reason the expenditure of public money that had been sanctioned for development at home had been restricted to public utility concerns and local authorities, and the conditions Imposed that the work would be accelerated and that it would tend to help the general trade and prosperity of the country.Secondly, the question of Colonial development had been tackled.   Mr. Thomas&apos;  experience as Colonial Seoretary had convinced him that there was tremendous scope there, and accordingly the Colonial Development Act had been passed authorising the expenditure of  1 million per annum.    The assistance to a Colony might take various forms, but It would havo to be shown that it would tend to the development of the Colony, while the materials to be used would be required to be bought in this country.     He was pleased to be able to say that already, as a result of the passing of the Aot, some very valuable contracts had been given to this country for steel and othor materials.Turning to nis visit to Canada, Mr.  Thomas said he went there to tackle certain very definite problems.    On the trade side he had been quite frank with the Canadian people.    He had been able to show that 2,000 million dollars of British money was invested in Canada, that much of it had been lent before American money was available and when monev was far more needed and did not produce the same return, he has pointed out that we were their beet single customers for their natural products,  that we bought a substantial

Those figures had startled them very much.He had concentrated on coal, and the initial steps as to this had had to be taken quietly to prevent American interests, coming in at special prices before any arrangements could be made.       He had taken out a oargo of ooal and had arranged for the Canadian National Railways and the Canadian Pacific Railway to test the ooal for him.    Its efficiency proved to be higher than any he had claimed for it,  so he was relieved of the task of boosting it himself.     On the question of prices, he had found that to compete successfully with American ooal, of which 16j million tons was imported into Canada every year, he oould not go beyond the Montreal and Quebec area beoause the unloading, reloading and rail charges would make sales beyond that area competitively Impossible.    Another difficulty was the heavy degradation, or what we called depreciation, of ooal from the time it left the pit to the time it arrived in Canada, which had a severe effect on the price.    He had inquired into the causes and had found that it was due partly to obsolete methods of screening at some of our collieries, partly to rough treatment in the small trucks coming down the valleys to the ports, and also partly to the coal being dropped from cranes into the holds of ships.    Some smashing also ooourred through rolling in holds of ships not completely filled..   He was arranging for the possibility of installing travelling oonveyors to replace cranes to be examined and for the screening equipment at the collieries to be looked into.His next step had been to interview a representative of as many concerns as possible in Eastern Canada using more than 500 tons of ooal per annum, and he had got them to agree to the principle of comparing British coal with other ooal on a basis of oalorific value and not of prioe alone. He hoped that, as a result of his talks with the railroads, the steamship companies and the other concerns, there would be an import into Canada in the Montreal-Quebec area of something like 1-g- million tons (soft coal and anthracite) next year.    He had called the owners in this country together and had suggested that they should set up their own organisation to deal with the Canadian export market.A serious obstacle to exporting coal to Canada was the difficulty in getting return cargoes of wheat, owing to the look-up of wheat in Canada,    Coal could bo carried at a freight of 6s. a ton to Montreal if a return cargo of wheat were assured, but if the ship had to come back in ballast it added immensely to the cost.    If some arrangement could be come to over wheat cargoes, the prospect of coal orders was so good that he understood private interests were prepared to build ten special ships for this work alone, without any Government assistance.
)unemployment and trade with canada - statement by-&apos;    gEITTOllTPRYvY sIaY^cWtdTHAnother difficulty which arose in Canada, and in meeting which he had had to face considerable political opposition, was the fear of the mining interests of Nova Scotia that any extension of the importation of British coal would injure them. He had endeavoured to meet that by suggesting the blending of British coal with Nova Scotian coal, in order to try to improve the latter and produce a fuel which was superior to Amerioan,   Experiments on these lines were now in progress.With regard to steel, of which 300,000 tons was imported from America into Canada each year, Mr. Thomas had been informed that for workmanship and price there was no reason why by far the greater part of it should not be made in this country, though there were complaints as to delivery and disinclination to meet Canadian needs.   He had persuaded the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Canadian National Railways to agree that all their steel tyres in future, as well as most of their other steel requirements,  should be bought in this oountry, subject to satisfactory price and delivery.    To faoilitate the carrying out of that agreement he had met the steel manufacturers here and had impressed on them the desirability of their having an organisation of their own in&apos; Canada of responsible men who could enter into engagements without having to cable to London.    They had.already made arrangements with this object in view.    In connection with electrical equipment what appeared to be a rather serious position had been revealed,    Mr. Thomas&quot; had been informed that English firms had been invited to tender for a contract, but had refused and American firms had secured the contract. The reason alleged for the British refusal was   an agreement, enforced by American controlling interests, under which the British firms were prohibited from competing in the Canadian market.SIR GUY GRANET observed that he had gone into this question from another point of view and he was very muoh surprised to hear of the existence of the arrangement.    It went to the root of the whole conception of the proper trade relations between England and America if it were true.    It was one thing for a cartel to apportion markets, but quite another for foreign concerns to put capital into one of our Industries and for that industry to pay the penalty of being sterilised in one of its markets for the benefit of the foreign oountry.SIR HUGO HIRST stated that he also was not aware that suoh an arrangement existed between responsible electrical firms in this country and firms in America.    He had no doubt that Mr, Thomas had good evidence of its existence, but he was not himself aware of it, nor would his company countenance suoh an arrangement,MR. THOMAS, said that the matter was one to which he would not, of oourse, make any public reference, but it appeared to   him to be so serious that he proposed to have it thoroughly inquired into-
UNEMPLOYMENT AND TRADE WITH CANADA - STATEMENT BY THEH3QW-pRlVtt SEAL TUCT3TBTT. -xOne other thing ?/hich he had taken up with the Canadians were the regulations governing the grant of preferential duties to British goods, under which the Canadian Government had recently raised the percentage of labour and materials to qualify for the preferential rates from 25% to 50%t     Under the new regulations some of the most important of the Lancashire cotton goods were excluded from participating in the preference because the raw material, the cotton, could not be grown within the Empire.     He had discussed our difficulties with&apos;the Prime Minister, Mr. Mackenzie King, and with Mr. Euler, the Minister of National Revenue, and he hoped within a short time to be able to announce that they had been straightened out by the suggestion he had made that raw material which could not be grown within the Empire should be excluded for the purpose of calculating the percentage.Finally, with regard to Canada, Mr. Thomas urged that business men in this country should follow up the preliminary work he had done there.     The coal and steel industries had already arranged to do so and there was a large scope for other businesses as well.      In order to assist industry in this respect, the Government had decided to strengthen our Trade Commissioners in Canada, and also,  incidentally, they had decided to Increase their number in other parts of the world.Returning to the stimulation of trade generally, Mr. Thomas stressed the importance of vigorously tackling the question of the export motor trade.     At present 80 per cent of the world&apos;s production of cars was concentrated in America and Canada, chiefly America;    five per cent only being made in this country.     An examination of our Dominions alone, excluding Canada, showed that, except in motor cycles, we were badly beaten, in spite of sentiment being in our favour.     The question of taxation would be re-examined, but although the Government might be able to do something, the problem would have to be tackled boldly by the industry itself, not with a narrow minded view of the interests of one concern, but in the interests of all concerns working together.THE PRESIDENT Invited members to ask any questions arising out of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s address, which Mr. Thomas would be glad to answer.SIR HUGO HIRST suggested that steps should be taken to&apos; expedite the Post Office programme of telephone development. The electrical industry as a whole was busy, but there had been discharges of employees In the section concerned with telephones and he was told that the Treasury would not give the necessary credit to enable the Post Office scheme to go on.As regards the electrical Industry in Canada, we had been organised for years to do business there in general electrical commodities and had been compelled to withdraw from Canada on account of the conditions as to testing.     There was no doubt that British electrical products were in no way Inferior to American or- those of any other country;   our very climate
1*4 UCOW IDEM1 IAL.UNEMPLOYMENT AND TRADE WITH CANADA - STATEMENT BY THE LORD PRIVY SEAL (CONTD).necessitated better insulation and better construction, yet Canada stipulated that all tests for Insulations should be made by the American underwriters in Chicago.     The Chicago laboratory was in the hands of American manufacturers, and British manufacturers found the greatest difficulty in introducing their standard goods, which any impartial laboratory would consider first class.ISR. THOMAS replied that, as regards Sir Hugo Hirst &apos;s point as to telephone development, there had never been any difference with the Treasury in this matter and he would not be handicapped.     He had discussed the question of telephone development with the Postmaster General and expected to receive shortly a report as to what could be put In hand.As regards the testing of electrical&apos; goods, his advice was to disregard past experience and to try again.     The American tariff proposals had so alarmed Canadian opinion that there would probably shortly be a strong reaction in favour of this country.MR. FUGH asked if the representatives of the steel industry who were to go to Canada to handle the steel orders would deal directly with the actual producing organisations in this country.MR, THOMAS understood they would be the representatives of the producers.     The whole of the producers were combining for the purpose.SIR WALTER RAINE inquired if Mr. Thomas was satisfied that a freight rate of 6/- could be paid at the present c.i.f. price of coal, after allowing for all other charges. Shipowners in the coal trade, for some years past, had had to take for freight whatever was left after other expenses were paid.     He knew of a line of steamers running from the Tyne and from Leith to Canada which found the utmost difficulty in getting this coal trade and in&apos;the winter they had had to accept a return freight of l/ioid. a ton, which merely paid the loading charges.MR. THOMAS thought the best answer was that, as he had mentioned earlier, a responsible shipowner was so satisfied about the position that he was proposing to order new ships for this very trade.      Mr. Thomas had considered the situation arising out of the fact that the St. Lawrence was closed for five months in the year and that cargoes had to be provided for both ways within the seven months period during which the St. Lawrence was open.      After making all allowances for depreciation of ships, fair profit, Insurance etc. he was convinced that 6/- a ton for coal out and 13/ a bushel for wheat back was a good paying proposition, but if ships had to come back in ballast or go out in ballast for wheat, the situation was entirely altered.     The difficulty In getting return cargoes of wheat had led him to offer the Canadian Wheat Pool to put up public elevators on this side. The Wheat Pool, however, quite frankly admitted that their policy was to keep the wheat in Canada, because when it came

WARHAM mentioned, as a matter of Interest, that last year the average freight paid on coal from here to Canada was 6/2d.      This year they had been paying more, chiefly because the shipowners had not heen able to get return cargoes.He wished to say that the British coal trade appreciated very highly indeed the efforts the Lord Privy Seal had made in attempting to help them to export their coal to Canada. They had appointed a strong committee representative of the exporting districts, under the Chairmanship of Lord Weir, and that committee was meeting Mr. Thomas that afternoon to go into the details.MR. HERBERT LEE thanked Mr. Thomas on behalf of the cotton textile industry for the action he had taken over the question of the Canadian preference regulations.     His solution, if accepted by the Canadian Government, would affect delivery from here to Canada of something like three-quarters of a million sterling.     He would not say we should have lost that trade, but it would have been prejudiced by the Canadian Government&apos;s original action,THE PRESIDENT expressed, on behalf of the Council, their thanks for the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s attendance and their appreciation of his address.     He had given them a great many facts regarding Canada and a good deal of material which must be recognised as controversial in character.     There was, however, a great contribution to be made on the lines of his address and he had certainly made it at that meeting.Kr. Thomas then left and the Council proceeded, with the usual reports on the state of trade.COAL.MR. WARHAK stated that In August the exports of coal from this country, far from reaching the high figure of July, which was, of course, a record for the year, were  (excluding those to the Irish Free State) only 4,778,000 tons, compared with 5,638,000 tons in July; a decrease of 860,000 tons.    The largest decrease was in South Wales, chiefly owing to a reduction in the exports to South American countries.     There was a slight improvement in Durham for gas and coking coal, owing to the extraordinary drought on the Continent, which had caused the draught of water in the rivers and canals to -be too low ibr open navigation and had hampered their trade during the month of August.     The exports from this country from January to August this year. Including those to the Irish Free State, exceeded the quantity for the corresponding period of last year by nearly six million tons, which was a very encouraging feature. The principal increases occurred in the exports to
COAL.     (CONTP.)Sweden, Norway and Denmark 825,500 tons,- the Netherlands nearly half a million tons; Belgium 1,186,000 tons; France 2,135,000 tons; Australia 298,000 tons (owing to the strike over there); and Canada 64,000 tons.    Exports by sea from Poland also showed a slight decrease from 763,000 tons In July to 758,000 tons in August, but they were still shipping at the rate of over nine million tons per annum.Schemes, both District and Inter-District, were still in the making, and, in the meantime, the Five Counties Scheme had only been renewed for three months.There seemed to be a gradual expansion of trade in the coal consuming industries of Europe, and the prospects for the coal trade for this and the next year were quite good.    It remained to be seen whether the diplomatic recognition of Russia would have any effeot in increasing their purchases of coal from this country.Tonnage had become a little more normal lately.    There was still some scarcity, but it was not troubling the collieries to the same extent ae it had been two or three months ago.SIR WALTER RAIIjE stated that the price of special coals had been maintained during the past three months in spite of the shortage of tonnage.    On the other hand Durham and second, class coals had fallen, though the lower price had brought more orders.He wished to call attention to the serious cases of firing which had occurred in the Australian coal trade in the last three or four months.&apos;   It had got to such a pass that under-writers were demanding special insurance premiums for the voyage to Australia,    he did not know whether the captains or officers of particular steamers were to blame in not taking the hatches off in fine weather, or whether the firing was due to steam pipes passing round the bunkers and causing heating. He thought it was worth while having the matter inquired into because, if there were a restriction of tonnage, this trade which had been increasing&quot; would come to an end.THE PRESIDENT observed that, with regard to the firing of coal cargoes, reports were always made to him on any casualties to British ships and he would give careful attention to those mentioned by Sir W. Raine.MR. MITCHELL wrote:-&quot;In the coal trade in Scotland there is still a fair demand.    Some time is, however, being lost for want of tonnage in the East Coast.    The exports shew an improvement over last year and prices are distinctly better.    Some business is
opal, (oontd.).being done over next year, but this may be due to the fear of some disturbance In the trade.    Polish competition is not decreasing, although the prices for Polish coal are higher.&quot;IRON AND STEEL.MR, BOND observed that the improvement promised at the beginning of the year had hardly materialised.    The reports from the north east coa3t stated that the production of ingots for the month of September was greater than for the month of August, but that,owing to the slackening off in ship building the demand for steel was not quite so good and there had also been a falling off in exports.    The prospects for October and the next three months were fairly good, but the steel makers were beginning to display some anxiety with regard to further business.    In Scotland business was not coming in as quickly as orders were being executed.    There was an increase in the imports of Continental steel, and the price at which it was being sold was rather Beriously affecting the steel industry in South Wales.    The price of imported semi-finished steel products was 20/- to 25/- a ton under the price of the Welsh products.    The sheet industry of South Wales remained in an unsatisfactory condition, but on the other hand the tin-plate industry was now working nearly 85/S of capacity - order books being well filled and the demand good and prices firm.    The tin-plate industry was perhaps in a better position than it had been in since 1925.MR. MITCHELL wrote:--&quot;The sorap position in the Scottish iron and steel trade is easier.      Some large purchases have been made for import into Scotland, and the export was small in August.     The price of scrap is slightly reduced.     The iron and steel trade is not busy and there is slackness at the works, especially in plates, and some time is being lost.      The Imports of iron and steel into Scotland for August were heavy, the total being 61,785 tons.      Of this 4,215 tons is pig iron from Belgium and Prance.     This latter point appears to be an indication that the competition in pig iron is again growing&quot;.NON-FERROUS METALS.CAPTAIN LYTTELTON wrotei-BConditions generally have been quiet.    In copper the month opened with considerable activity, which has since fallen away.    The cable trade is fairly good, but brass business la only moderate.    In lead the demand for metal for cables has
NON-FERROUS METALS  (CONTD).been good, but the sheet and pipe trade Is distinctly PQor.      In Spelter the orders taken by galvanisers are disappointing, and show a considerable falling off on last month.&quot;The tinplate Industry is working at about 84$ of its capacity.     This is due to the fact that the output has increased very much during the last few years.     The exports of tinplates this year will probably be a record, and the home consumption Is good.     The price today is about  1 a ton higher than at the beginning of the year and the market Is firm.&quot;ENGINEERINGSSIR ERNEST PETTER wrote :-&quot;The general statistical position of the engineering industry showed little or no weakening during the month of August.     Exports of engineering manufactures declined slightly in August from July figures, although still above the disappointingly low totals of June.     On the other hand, there has been a steady Increase during recent months in the imports.     Exports of machinery in August amounted to 44,896 tons making a total for the eight months of the year of 378,016 tons, some 2% below the corresponding total of 385,712 tons last year. Imports of machinery this year to date amount to 76,295 tons, compared with 67,065 tons in 1928.&quot;The index of unemployment for engineering in June, July and August has been 8.5$, 8.6$, and 9.2$ respectively. All branches of the engineering Industry have suffered increased unemployment throughout this period, with the exception of electrical engineering.International Iron and Steel Production.&quot;Iron and steel constitute the principal raw materials of engineering, and it is estimated that our Industry In Its various branches consumes about 30$ of the Iron and steel available annually for consumption in this country.     In view of that fact, and with particular regard to the coming Inquiry by the Civil Research Sub-Committee into the position of the Iron and steel Industries, it is important to examine the statistics of the recent output of Iron and steel, both In Great Britain and in the principal producing countries abroad. The United Kingdom was the only country in 1928, as also in the Intervening years, whose pig iron output did not equal that of 1924, while our production of steel in 1928 barely exceeded the 1924 level.     In each Instance the index figures of all other countries were well above the 100 per cent, basis of 1924.     The available data for the first six months of this year record a marked proportional improvement in the British outputs as compared with 1928 totals, but this is also the case in every other country. The enormous production of both Iron and steel In the United States during the half-year. IS particularly notable.&quot;
CONFIDENTIAL.MARINE ENGINEERING.MR. RICHMOND wrote:-ttIn marine engineering there is little change to report. In employment there is a slight decrease in September, compared with the previous month.&quot;The Olyde position is reported as showing a rather &apos; poorer outlook for the winter, as only a few contracts have been booked during the month.    The output for September was poor also;    10 vessels of 27,968 tons being launched, which was lower than any provious month this year.    The total Output for the nine months is less than that of the corresponding period last year by 84^722 tons.    The total for the year, however,  is expected to be substantial, but will be much below the capacity of the extended works.    A number of enquiries are in circulation, some for large liners,  and some for general trading vessels, but not enough are expected to materialise into contracts to justify hopes of maintaining the present level of employment during the winter.&quot;From North East Coast yards the July - September output exceeded that of the corresponding period last year by 30,524 tons, and there is a more favourable tone In the industry. The marine engineering works have a fair amount of business in hand, and will profit from recent foreign orders placed for general cargo boats and Diesel tankers.&quot;At Belfast most of the cargo ships awaiting completion of the Joiner work are otherwise finished and this has necessitated paying off large numbers of men in the engineering trades.      There are prospects for both the leading firms here securing new tonnage, and were the Strike out of the way, it is-probable that considerable activity would ensue.&quot;General engineering in Scotland showed signs of Improvement during the past month, and there was a small decrease in the number of the&apos; unemployed.    Some good orders for locomotives and structural steel have been secured&quot;.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.SIR HUGO HIRST said there had not been much change in the electrical industry since the previous month, when he had sent in a full report.MOTOR INDUSTRY.SIR WILLIAM MORRIS was pleased to be able to report that the position in the motor trade was still good and that prospects for next year were also bright.    They were at present waiting for the opening of the Motor Show and by the next meeting he would be able to give the Council an idea of the prospects as affected by the Show.
CONFIDENTIAL. MOTOR INDUSTRY  (CONTD. ).SIR CYRIL HURCOMB sent the following report:--     &quot;The number of motor vehicles (excluding motor cycles) newly registered in July,  1929, was 3,462 more than in the corresponding period of 1928.      Cars taxed on horse power increased by 1,436, goods vehicles by 1,883. and motor hackneys by 273;    there was a decrease of 130 In   other vehicles&quot;.     As regards motor cycles, the number registered in July,  1929, was 1,532 more than in July, 1928, but 2,393 less than in the corresponding period of 1927.&quot;COTTON.SIR KENNETH STEWART was afraid he had not a very good report to give for the cotton trade in September,     Most export firms continued to complain that it was difficult to obtain profitable orders and there were many signs that merchant businesses dealing with the East were feeling the depression very badly.     One firm after another was reducing its staff,  its salaries, or in some Y;ay displaying distress,, That was a bad sign, because the cotton trade depended, at the coarse end of the trade, on the Eastern business,,     The trade in China was still poor;    it was suffering from the continued drop in the price of silver, because the currency of that country was in silver.     There was some improvement in India, but the improvement was rather slow, though there was time for this to improve, because delivery was ordinarily taken right up to February.      South America seemed to be showing signs of improvement and there-was a good flow of orders beginning to come in.The rise in the Bank rate was a severe blow to the export trade, owing to the long time that merchants wore out of their money, and during which they would have to pay a higher rate of interest.     Such a rise was always apt to cause a reduction in stocks carried.     Most other countries were finding trade as difficult as we, except in the case of Japan, which still seemed to be expanding and making serious inroads into our trade with India.      Already Japan had captured most of the trade In China.The Lancashire Cotton Corporation continued to make progress,     About ten more mills had decided to join during the month and the necessary legal formalities were being accelerated.MR. HAYHURST asked if it were not true that some firms did not want to enter this merger, but were being forced to do so by the banksc     He thought the banks might help the individual firms far more than they seemed inclined to do.sir K. STEWART said the position was that no firm which was successful and which was solvent could have any pressure put upon it to join anything.     A large number of the firms who had joined the Corporation had done so voluntarily.     In a great many cases, however, it was true that the banks had found mills very heavily indebted to them, and with no chance
COTTON (CONTD. ).of that indebtedness being paid off in any way.     He had taken out a balance sheet of 200 mills;    these mills had a capital of  28,000,000, and they actually owed  29,000,000, while the w ole value of their property was nothing like that under present circumstances.     That meant that in a number of cases the mills were hopelessly Insolvent and they had nothing to offer their creditors except the mills themselves.     The banks were unwilling to liquidate and sell these mills because the only consequence would have been that the mills would have been shut down and a large proportion of the trade would have gone abroad.     They preferred the course of giving thera another chance.     At the same time the banks felt that there was no chance for such mills under their existing conditions and therefore the banks had to some extent backed up the new plan of amalgamation.      In certain cases the banks had had to put in Receivers In order to compel the mills to join the Lancashire Cotton Corporation, but the alternative was to put in Receivers and sell them for what they would fetch.     As far as he could judge, the banks had been extremely lenient, and the terms which they would take In present circumstances were such as it was quite impossible to get from any other creditors of the mills who were in the same position as the banks.     He was quite convinced that something in the nature of a merger was absolutely necessary, and that the whole object of the Corporation was to try and bring about an expansion in the cotton trade by introducing more scientific methods into production and distribution, which were exceedingly necessary in the cotton trade.MR. HERBERT LEE said he had nothing to add to the full report which Sir Kenneth Stewart had given.MR. LENNOX LEE handed in the following statement&quot;The three weeks stoppage owing to the strike and the extra week for holidays should have made September a good month, but. manufacturers who are well booked up are the exception rather than the rule.      The 6.41$ reduction in wages took effect in the second week in September.     The weavers organisation have expressed great dissatisfaction and suggestions have been put forward to apply for an Immediate advance.      American futures during the month lost 30 points, Egyptian, on the other hand, had wider fluctuations of about 120 points.&quot;As regards the bleaching trade deliveries during the first half of the month were very low in consequence of the small receipts of cloth during August.    Deliveries improved during the seoond half,but did not reach the pre-stoppage level. In the calico printing section the slowing down of production during
COTTON (CONTD.).September was general.,    All markets, particularly the Far Eastern, appear to have been lifeless.    As regards the Near and Middle East one of the difficulties experienced is that of the over generous credits granted by foreign competitors.    These enable small merchants with little or no capital to trade, they cut the prices in order to get ready money, and thus upset the general level of market price.    As regards Persia and Baghdad it is understood that the Russians, for political reasons, are selling prints in many cases at prices equal only to the price of the grey cloth plus packing, freight, etc. with nothing for the cost of printing.    In the South &amp; Central American Market (including West Indies) tariffs are seriously affecting business.    In Brazil stocks are now being liquidated which were accumulated in anticipation of the new tariff which came into operation in March last.    In Cuba the preferential tariff of 331/3$ which is accorded to the United States of America, as compared with this country,  is an aBset to United States of America competitors&quot;.WOOL.MR., HAMILTON said that his appointment was so recent that the Council would hardly expect a formal report from him.    The reason for Mr. Shaw&apos;s absence was, no doubt, that he was engaged in the    discussions on the wages question.    That matter was till unsettled.    The difference between the employers and employed was a very small one and it should be possible to get over it.    The woollen textile trade was still suffering to a large extent from the drop in wool prices.    Ever since January 1928 there had been a continual fall in prices;    the price of merino combed wool was then 57d,  and now 36d.,  so that wool was selling at present at practically pre-war prices.There was one matter to which he wished to draiv the attention of the Board of Trade and that was the effect cf the extension of the Export Credits Scheme to Russia on the woollen textile industry.    Russia intended as far as possible to import raw material or practically raw material.    Their requirements in manufactured textiles   -/ere great, but generally speaking they were placing their orders in Poland for manufactured goods.    The feeling in Bradford was that the manufacturers of textiles should have a good proportion of the benefits of the credit scheme, and that Russia should not be assisted to take up raw or semi-raw materials.MR. ARTHUR SHAW wrote:-&quot;There has not yet been any settlement of the wages question for the wool textile trade and to-day (8th October) a meeting of the Industrial Council will be held to receive the report from the trade unions.    Unless there is a definite agreement reached at the Council meeting to-day it
WOOL (OONTD.) .would almost appear impossible that an agreement will be secured to cover the industry as a whole.    The action of the trade unions in deciding to take a ballot vote of their members on the final proposals which will be made at the Conference with the Employers will at least prevent any immediate &quot;Cessation of work unless the employers decide to post notices forthwith, in which case instructions would be given to all the trade unionists to cease work before accepting any change in the present wage rates&quot;.HOSIERY.MR. WALKER stated that reports from the various centres continued conflicting, but on balance it could be said that trade, was still disappointing and not as good as it had been a year ago.      In Nottingham the underv/ear manufacturers were fairly well employed on goods for the autumn season and substantial deliveries were being made.    It only needed a spell of seasonable weather to make this section quite brisk.    Whilst the outer-wear trade had been quiet,  it was now improving and a good demand was expected for the two and three piece suit during the coming season.    Real silk fashioned hose and artificial 3ilk fine gauge hose continued in demand, but plain and fancy cashmere hose were rather neglected.    Cashmere half hose, both plain and fancy, were, however, receiving more attention than for some little time past.In Leicester business continued to be disappointing and orders were coming in slowly.    The fancy outer-wear trade continued good as far as novelties were concerned&apos;;    the desire for novelties was becoming more pronounced and the difficulty was to provide sufficient assortment to ensure a big turnover. The underwear section in Leicester was suffering from the long spell of warm weather, but it was anticipated that trade would soon improve.    In Hinckley, trade was very much the same as last month, but the artificial silk trade was undoubtedly feeling the uncertainty with regard to the McKenna duties.CHEMICALS.MR. HILL handed in the following notes:-&quot;Trade generally in chemicals appears to have quietened down, though there is a brighter tone in the forward delivery markets, particularly in respect of heavy chemicals and some coal tar products.      There is no change to report in the home trade as a whole, but export trade 3hows a slight improvement.
CHEMICALS (CONTD.)*&quot;A more hopeful tone in the British superphosphate industry now prevails.    The trade has been suffering for many years past from unrestricted foreign competition, and the hopeful tone arises only from the (apparently justifiable) assumption that the limit of foreign imports has been reached.     Aocording to statistics prepared by the Fertilizer Manufacturers&apos; Association, foreign importations were 154,534 tons in 1928, as against 202,092 tons in 1927 -a decrease of 23$.    Production in British and Irish factories totalled 498,800 tons in 1928 as compared with 510,900 tons in 1927j     decrease in consumption amounted only to 4,900 tons, so that stocks in British factories were materially reduced during the year - whioh is a point to the good.    Since the beginning of the year prices have improved somewhat and consumption has Increased, while imports have been on a lower scale.    On the other hand, freight rates on raw materials - phosphate rock and pyrites - have risen to such an extent as to neutralise the effect of the improvement in prices.    It is clear that the position is much stronger on the Continent, where, mainly as the result of the remarkable change in the sulphuric acid market in Belgium, prices have risen to a much greater extent than in Great Britain.&quot;An item of interest to report is the fact that the total British production of nitric acid is now obtained synthetically.&quot;The amount of sulphuric acid manufactured during the first half of the year 1929 was 488,000 tonB, calculated as 100$ acid - the highest recorded during any of the past eight years, and 31,000 tons in excesB of the previous highest record during the first six months of 1928. The following figures show the quantity of sulphuric acid manufactured in the United Kingdom and Ireland during recent years;-1925...............    848,000 tons  (100$ acid)1926...............    722,000      &quot;        &quot;        n1927...............    889,000      w        w        n1928...............    928,000      wwh1929 (six months)..    488,000     &quot;       &quot;H&quot;Owingto the depressed state of the market, three sulphuric acid plants have been scrapped during the past twelve months.     The percentage of the plant capacity in operation during this period was 69.3 - a figure which indicates that the problem of redundant plant which was a heritage of the war is still important.     There has been little change in the consumption of raw materials.     The whole of the Increased manufacture has been derived from further importations of pyrites, chiefly from Spain.    The amount of &quot;bye-product&quot; acid resulting from the manufacture of spelter in the United Kingdom remains at about 9^fo of the total.     During the last five years the selling price of sulphuric acid has shown approximately a 20$ decrease&quot;.
GENERAL TRADE.Co-operative Wholesale Society.MR. HAYHURST handed in the following report:-&quot;The sales effected by my Society during the month of September, 1929, shew that steady increases have been recorded. The last available statistics at my disposal reveal that sales of over 6-1 millions and 2f million pounds sterling respectively for 4 weeks and 2 weeks have been effected, being increases over the corresponding periods of last year of 6% and 5$ respectively.    The Increases I consider very satisfactory indeed.&quot;The production of goods in our factories - Groceries, Provisions, Textiles, Hardware, Boots and Shoes - are all of an increasing character.    In the Banking Section also, business has been of a very satisfactory character.    The number of Depositors have steadily increased during the month.    Stocks on hand in all our Sections call for no special comment, being of the character commensurate with the large trade done by us.BUTTER.- The production of Danish has been readily absoroed each week.    The recent drought experienced In all countries had the effect of diminishing production somewhat, with the result that prices moved upwards.    It may be taken that the production of Danish, at the moment, is about at the lowest point of the season and reduction in price is hardly likely until arrivals of the new season&apos;s colonials are to hand.    The best value offering at the moment is, probably, Irish Creamery.   Quality is&apos;all that can be desired and supplies have moved very freely into consumption.CHEESE:-   Receipts of Canadian make from May 1st to September 14th, 1929, shew a decrease of over 91,000 boxes as compared with the corresponding period of last year.    It Is estimated that the season&apos;s output will shew a diminished quantity of 20% below 1928.    The good demand prevailing is indicative of the present upward tendency in the market being continued.    There has been, and is still, an increasing demand for Lancashire and Cheshire make with prices shewing a tendency to advance.SUGAR. -   At the time of writing market was shewing steady. At the recent advanced price sugars of every description are shewing a firm indication.WHEAT.-   After ruling easy for several days, the wheat market, within the past week, turned firmer and higher prices were registered.    The Jolliers, however, did not follow the advance in view of heavy arrivals being in prospect.    Visible supplies of U.S.A.  continue very heavy.    It is reported that stores everywhere are fully loaded, and that the U.S.A. Government have found it necessary to make enquiries as to the length of time wheat will keep In a proper marketable condition, as there are still large quantities of 1928 crop In store.    The Canadian harvest is now practically complete. The crop is estimated to yield 300,000,000 bushels.    Prices of Canadian wheat are on a higher comparison than U.S.A.  or Argentine with the result that European Importers have Canadian in view of that fact.
GENERAL TRADE (CONTD. )Co-operative Wholesale Society.  (Contd.)BACON AND HAMS.-   Altered weather conditions and greatly reduoed supplies from all continental sources have forced up prices which seem likely to hold for the time being.TEA.- Markets as a rule hav6 continued steady, little change taking place in quotations.    The common and lower grade teas, of which there has been a too great quantity, have shown a tendency to decline in price, but quality has been correspondingly lower.    On the other hand good liquoring and fine teas, in all growths, have made top prices so that average prices, generally speaking, have been realised in public sale.    Later the prices for low Indian tea became steady with quality   from some of the better gardens improving and some higher quotations were realised^, especially for tippy tea.    The quality of Ceylon tea has been rather uneven.    All .good liquoring kinds have been in active demand, maintaining fully previous prices, and the quality from some of the higher grown Ceylon gardens showing an improvement caused keen competition in this class.    All other qualities realised the recent average rate.COFFEE.-   Only very small quantities have been offered for auction.    Costa Rica, generally poor of quality, realised steady prices, whilst British East Africa met with fair general competition at steady prices.   Generally speaking, the demand has been sluggish and only limited quantities found buyers.    Some support has been accorded to mountain grown Jamaica, but this, whilst certainly an item of interest, is an exceptional circumstance.COCOA.-   As the season has only just commenced, there is little to report.    Business in spot goods has been very quiet and remains so, whilst forward positions have been steadier.   With the advent of the season there will be much more to report next month.&quot;Retail Distributive Trade.SIR WOODMAN BUR3IDGE handed in the following report: -&quot;The figures this month confirm the current prese reports that September would prove to bo a bad month for the retail distributive trades as represented by the Departmental Stores.    The reports show a singularly uniform series of decreases as compared with the corresponding month of last year, and this result may be almost wholly accounted for by the exceedingly fine weather.   While no difficulty was met with in disposing of any light-weight summer wear left over, the public could not be induced to take an Interest in autumn merchandise, and there is now a considerable danger, with tho weather turning suddenly from summer to winter, that the autumn trade will not materialise at all.    That the unseasonable weather has been almost wholly responsible for the falling off in trade is confirmed by the considerable improvement that has taken place during the last few days.
GENERAL TRADE  (CONTD.).Retail distributive trade (contd.).m&quot;To analyse the various figures by districts,  in the West End of London only one increase is reported in piece goods as against a long series of decreases varying from 5$ to 20$, and showing an average of 13%.    In women1s wear, the decreases average 14$, with only one increase which is accounted for by exceptional circumstances.      The men&apos;s wear departments have also been badly hit, while in boots and shoes, against two small increases, tho decreases in turnover as compared with last year average 11^.    In furniture the variations are of minor Importance, and sales in the hardware departments have been slightly better, but in the other departments of the Stores an average fall of some 10$ is reported.    The Stores in the Outer London districts have suffered from a similar experience, though possibly to an accentuated degree.     Among the firms that have reported, piece goods are down 15$, women&apos;s wear 22$, and men&apos;s wear 25$.     The hardware and furniture departments report decreases of varying degree, while, in the other departments, there is an average fall of 13$.    The oause of these unsatisfactory conditions is attributed by the firms concerned to exceptionally warm weather which had the effect of prolonging the holiday season, and it is not thought that unemployment and short-time working have had more than their usual effect. In the North, retail trade has had, in addition,  the unsettled industrial conditions to contend with, and short-tim in the cotton trade together with the unfavourable situation in the wool trade, is definitely having its effect, apart from the unseasonable weather conditions which have applied generally.    In the piece good departments, one small increase of 3$ is reported, while against this there are a long series of decreases amounting to an average of 10$.    No single case of an increased turnover is reported in women&apos;s wear, men&apos;s wear, and the boot and shoe departments, the falls averaging 9$, 14$ and 11$ respectively.      Furniture, however, appears to have sold better,  and apart from one reported decrease, the increases average 21$, and the hardware departments also show a small rise.    In the South, there is no ohange to report in the general experience.    There is again a fair increase to report in the number of staff employed&quot;.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIPPING.SIR WALTER RAINE reported that In shipbuilding in the North of England there had been very few orders coming in owing to the fall in freights for large tonnage in the ocean going trade.      A shipbuilder in Sunderland had told him that he had three berths, one of which would be vacant next month and tho others would be empty by March, and at present he saw no prospect of any other orders coming along.    Ship-repairing continued in a fairly good condition, and on the Mersey there had boen a great improvement in the past two months.

Increase     217,200Coal, Coke and Patent Fuel..... &quot; 2,208,800&quot;The inorease in coal traffic was chiefly in North .East England and South Wales.&quot;The latest statistics available are for the month of July, 1929.      Compared with the corresponding period in 1928 the number of passenger journeys taken on all standard gauge railways in Great Britain (excluding the London tubes and Metropolitan District Railway) increased by nearly 5 millions equal to 5.8 per cent, but owing to the increase in cheap fares the receipts shewed a decrease of  50,000 equal to 0.7 per cent.&quot;Freight traffic increased by 3,700,000 tons or 15 per cent, coal, &apos;coke and patent fuel accounting for 2,700,000   tons.     Other commodities which shewed substantial increases in July were - iron ore, limestone for blast furnaces, pig iron, iron and steel, manure (paoked), and oil cake.    Iron ore, limestone, manure, and oil cake, as well as coal, coke and patent fuel, come within the scope of the Railway Freight Rebates (Anticipation) Scheme&quot;.EMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS wrote:-&quot;Since the end of August there has been a net increase in the numbers unemployed on the registers    of

The alight fall In the figures In the last three weeks of August continued until the 16th September, but was followed by Increases whioh amounted to a total of over 34,000.     The numbers wholly unemployed Increased in each week of the month and nearly the whole of the increase in the last two weeks has been in that catergory.&quot;In the Southern Divisions the figures have followed a normal seasonal trend,      In the Midlands the improvement in employment continued until the last week of the month when there was a slight decline, and this Division together with the North Western shows a net deorease in unemployment over the month as a whole.     In Scotland and&apos; Wales there has been little change, but in the North Eastern Division there was a sharp rise in unemployment in the last week of the month, principally at coal mining, iron and steel and woollen and worsted textile centres.&quot;The average Live Register during September was 1,160,503.&quot;In coal mining there has been a further improvement. At 23rd September, there were 119,095 insured persons recorded as wholly unemployed and 43,627 temporarily stopped giving a total of 162,722 as compared with 125,199 wholly unemployed and 48,777 temporarily stopped or a total of 173,976 at 26th August.     There was thus a fall during the month of 11,254 in the total number unemployed equivalent to, a drop of 1.0 in the rate of unemployment.      The rate at 23rd September stood at 10.7 wholly unemployed and 3.9 temporarily stopped or a total of 14.6 per cent, as compared with 15.6 at 26th August and 21.6 at 24th September,  1938. - &quot;       &apos;&quot;The net number of insured workpeople in the coal mining industry has decreased in each of the past three years, as follows:-Net decreaseJuly,  1926 - June,  1927  ......... 26,800&quot;      &quot;1927 -      &quot;      1928  ......... 48,470&quot;        1928 -      &quot;      1929  ......... 36,200(Frcvision-al__e stimate)Total net decrease  .. 111,470&quot;The &quot;surplus&quot; in the industry has therefore been worked off during the three years to the extent of 111,500.&quot;As the result of the new count of the insured population in connection with the exchange of unemployment books In July last the estimated numbers insured for each month since July,  1928, have been revised.

SANDERSON reported that the opening wool sales for the season during September showed prices averaging about 33:f lower than corresponding sales last year.    As far as could be seen the prospects of wool prices returning to the level of two or three years ago were distinctly poor, and Australia would have to face that position.Exports of wheat for this season were 79,206,000 bushels? compared with 47,491,000 last season.     A poll of New South   I Wales wheat growers rejected the proposal to establish a wheat marketing board under the State Marketing Act, but
AUSTRALIAN TRADE .(CONTD.)Victorian wheatgrowers had reqiiested the State Government to introduce legislation for marketing wheat.    Exports of flour this season were 465,000 tons compared \vith 339,000 tons last season.     Dairy production was steadily increasing in all States.    The Commonwealth production of sugar for the 1929 season was 517,000 tons compared with 522,000 tons last season.    Australian requirements were 335,000 tons, leaving 182,000 tons for export.Bank clearances In all capitals from 1st January to 31st August last were  1,549,517,000, an increase of  5,973,000 over the same period of 1928,      The Customs collections for September were  3,020,000, an Increase of  288,5 00 over the previous September.INDIAN TRADE.MR. GUPTA said the latest figures (those for August) showed a balance of trade in favour of India of 5,48 lakhs of rupees.    The imports for August showed a fair increase over those for the previous month and a slight one over those for August 1928.    The export figures were also higher than those for the previous month and slightly in excess of those for August 1928.    The detailed figures for August had not yet been received.    The final jute forecast figures were received in London on the 17th September, and showed an area under cultivation of 3,317,000 acres with an out turn of 9,767,000 bales.    These figures, as compared with last year&apos;s final forecast, showed an increased acreage, but a decrease in quantity, so that the average out turn of jute per acre was not up to the standard of last year.    The trade confidently expected, however, that the actual out turn would considerably exceed the estimated out turn this year, as it did last year. Jute prices, since the publication of the forecast, had gone down steadily, but It was anticipated that they would soon show an upward tendency.    The situation in the Bombay cotton mills showed a steady Improvement.    On the 18th September, 73 mills were working with 121,000 hands.    The strike in the Golmuri Tin Plate Company, Jamshedpur, continued though there had been an improvement in the number of men working.    The sporadic jute mill strikes in Bengal appeared now to have come finally to an end.The floods In Sind and the Punjab had caused heavy damage both to property and agriculture.    It had as yet not been possible to assess the damage accurately, but strenuous measures were being taken by the Government in every direction for the alleviation of distress and the repair of damage.    The Bihar and Orissa Governments had applied to the Empire Marketing Board for a grant to help towards the cost of sending an officer to this country to study the subject of the grading and marketing of Indian Shellac.    The Empire Marketing Board had sanctioned the grant and an expert forest officer had been deputed to carry out this research work in England.9 9 *
COiSlF IDEM? I&apos;AL. -     JCOLONIAL TRADE.MR. VERNON handed in the following report:-East Africa.    Statistical reports of the Kenya and Uganda Railway show that, for the first 6 months of 1929, as compared with the same period in 1928, there has &quot;been an increase of over 5% in the total export traffic carried to the Coast, a slight Increase In the total import traffic railed from Kilindini, and an increase of over 4z% in the total train mileage run,Tanganyika Territory.    According to the most recent estimates of crop production the total production of cotton will he 29,000 - 30,000 bales.     For the fir3b 6 months of 1929, the value of domestic exports was  1,490,784:    as compared with  1,380,063 in the corresponding period of 1928. One of the principal items in these exports is  cotton, of which 19,187 centals were exported, as compared with 3,983 centals in the corresponding period of 1928.     For the first 6 months of 1929, the value of the trade imports was  2,010,860, as compared with  1,861,341 in 1928.     The percentage of imports from the United Kingdom was 34$ in 1929 as compared with 39$&apos; in 1928.Kenya and Uganda.    For the first 6 months of 1929 the value of domestic exports from Kenya and Uganda was  4,249,977 as compared with  4,274,528 in the corresponding period of 1928.      With regard to Uganda, the export of cotton in the first 6 months of 1929 amounted to 543,951 centals as oompared with 454,454 centals In the corresponding period of 1928.     For the first 5 months of 1929, the value of the home consumption imports of Kenya and Uganda was  3,576,030: as compared with  3,210,810 for the corresponding period in 1928,     The percentage of imports from the United Kingdom was 56% in 1929 as compared with 57% in 1928.      Cotton crop prospects are reported to be good In Uganda:    and it is anticipated that the total production of tobacco will reach approximately 100,000 lbs.      The first Kenya crop report for the season 1929/30 is good.      It is not yet possible to estimate the yields of all the crops, but maize is considered to be above the average in all districts.Northern Rhodesia.     The value of mineral production in the first 7 months of 1929 was  620,296, as compared with  461,670 in the corresponding period of 1928.Gold Coast.     The value of the export trade during the first 6 months of 1929 was  7,177,313, as compared with  7,919,351 during the corresponding period of 1928.     The value of the import trade during the first 6 months of 1929 was  4,159,684,  as compared with  5,912,807 In 1938.      The percentage of Imports from the United Kingdom was 46% in 1929 as compared with 54% in 1928.Nigeria.      The value of the export trade for the first four&quot; months of 1929 was  6,996,455, as compared with  6,367,943 during the corresponding period of 1928.     The value of the import trade during the first 4 months of 1929 was  4,977,509:    as compared with  5,333,446 during the corresponding period of 1928.     During the first 5 months
9 9 COLONIAL TRADE (CONTD).of 1929, 393 motor cars and lorries of a value of  80,374 were imported, as compared with 561 of a value of  133,190 in the same period in 1928.     Of 236 motor cars Imported during the first 5 months of 1929, 172 were of British make and 97 of these were Morris cars.Trinidad.     The 1929 sugar crop established a new record: the total sugar made being 89,926 tons, as compared with 81,551 tons in 1928, which was the previous record year.British Malaya.     The amount of rubber exported from British Malaya in August totalled 50,441 tons, as compared with 46,454 tons in July, and 35,593 tons in August, 1928. For the first eight months of 1929 the gross exports were 580,989 tons, as compared with 219,717 tons for the corresponding period in 1928.     The output of tin and tin in ore from the Federated Malay States for the first eight months of 1929 amounted to 43,761 tons.     This compares with 40,934 tons in the corresponding period of 1928.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADEaMR. HOSE wrote:-&quot;The situation in Argentina continued to be adversely affected by the drought in the agricultural areas, to which I referred in my last report to the Council, until the middle of September, when general rains commenced to fall.     Prospects for the fine cereal crops became brighter on the occurrence of the rains, but the yields must show an appreciable reduction this coming season, as compared with the harvests last year. It appears probable that a compensating increase will take place In the area sown to maize - which is a later crop, not being harvested until about the beginning of March - owing to the fact that, in certain of the districts where ploughing ceased on account of drought, maize has been sown instead of fine cereals.     During the past month, shipments of wheat and maize have increased, owing to the more settled labour conditions at the Up-River ports.&quot;The full official returns of the foreign trade of Argentina for the first six months of 1929 show that the total value of Imports was 421,052 , 000 pesos (gold), against 441,619,000 pesos (gold) in the corresponding period of 1928, while exports also diminished to 531,971,000 pesos  (gold), against 577,355,000 pesos.     The export surplus in the first half of 1929 was therefore 110,919,000 pesos  (gold), against 135,7 36,000 pesos in January-June, 1928.     While the total value of exports from the Republic during the first six months of 1929 was less than in the corresponding period of 1928, owing to the generally lower level of prices, the quantity of shipments was higher, totalling 9,481,000 tons, against 9,237,000 tons.     At the same time, while the aggregate value of imports showed reduction, the volume was some 6.8 per cent, greater, the decline in prices amounting to about 11 per cent. Conditions in the Argentine markets for imported cotton and woollen goods are, on the whole, normal, although competition continues to be very keen.     Woollen articles, however, have
SQ7TH. AMERICAN TRADE  (CONTD).not been selling readily, and the market is reported to be somewhat over-stocked.&quot;Viewing the situation In Argentina as a whole, it is already apparent that the income to the Republic from her-export trade during the current year will not be so great as during 1928, and the possibility of any immediate or early recovery in the demand for Imported goods must be dependent upon the extent to which future weather conditions rectify the adverse situation created by the extended drought, which has only recently broken.&quot;The general commercial situation in Chile is characterised at the present time by seasonal dullness, but there are not lacking indications of sound basic conditions. The position of the various agricultural industries is considered satisfactory.     Production of copper continues at a high level, and active conditions are maintained in the manufacturing industries.     Sales of textile goods, however, are slow, especially in regard to cotton articles.     Sales of hardware, constructional machinery, and building materials continue good.     Official pronouncements as to the position of Chilean national finances continue to be of a very satisfactory nature, and as a further example of the goodwill of the Government towards the nitrate of soda industry, the Minister of Finance recently stated that the 1930 Budget estimates would limit the revenue from nitrate applicable to ordinary expenditure to only 170,000,000 pesos, any surplus to be set aside for direct and indirect assistance to the nitrate Industry.     Apart from Government assistance to the industry, the tendency for the Chilean producers to concentrate into a few large groups should prove of substantial benefit to the industry in its future development.&quot;in Brazil, trade conditions in the Rio de Janeiro districts give indications of a slow improvement, but the situation in Sao Paulo continues dull, business of all kinds at that centre being still very difficult.     The prolonged drought in the Sao Paulo areas has broken, rain having commenced during the last few days of August.     A scheme has been drawn up to float a private company to establish roasting and packing houses  in or near the Gity of Sao Paulo and to export ground coffee packed in airtight tins.      It is proposed to utilise only the finer grades of coffee and to commence advertising and exporting to encourage sales in the smaller foreign markets, where the per capita consumption at present is low.     This scheme, however,  is in abeyance for the time being,&quot;Exports of cotton from Peru have recently been restricted, the planters havin 5 shown a disposition to retain their supplies in preference to selling at the prevailing low prices.      The dull tone in the cotton market Is having a depressing effect on the general situation,&quot;Business conditions throughout Colombia are dull and there is no indication of an early improvement in the economic situation of the Republic.      Colombia is passing through a transitory period of credit stringency, which is the more
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE  (CONTD).unfortunate since the most urgent need of the country is for the extensive development of the railway and other transport systems, which, of course, calls for a steady inflow of capital, /&quot;The most favourable feature of the present situation in Venezuela is the continued increase in the production of petroleum.     Generally speaking, however, the situation is at present over-shadowed by political conditions and until these are stabilised it is difficult to forecast any substantial improvement in trading conditions.
