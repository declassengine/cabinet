9  *jTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANN1IO MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. BCBET CABINET,p73&quot;6o&quot;( 9). Oopx NoGRANTS TO NECESSITOUS AREAS.Memorandum by Minister of Health.I oiroulate for consideration a copy of a memorandum forwarded to mo by the Standing Joint Commit toe of Industrial Womens Organisations on the subject of distress prevailing in certain areas in the country.I saw a deputation of the Committee who urged strongly that special and early action by the Government was requisite.     I informed them in reply that I needed more specific information as to the actual conditions.     They undertook to furnish suoh information and they circulated a questionnaire widely in the distressed districts.    I attach to this memorandum specimen copies of the answers received which are fairly typical for such districts.At an earlier stage I prepared a draft memorandum to the Cabinet prbposing an Exchequer grant for the period of the winter to be spent in helping those authorities who are financially distressed to provide certain specified services. My proposal had the support of the Minister of labour and the President of the Board of Education, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer was unable to agree to it.     it may, however, be as well to add the draft paper to this memorandum with the observation that if action on it should now be taken, it would be necessary to extend it to areas other than those where the Coal Pields Distress Fund operates.I think it necessary to bring this question formally to the notice of the Cabinet before we separate for the Christmas holidays.
I v.m by no means satisfied that the efforts which are being made in the mining areas by the DistressFund combined with the operations of. the Boards of guardians in the relief of distress and of the local authorities in such matters as the provision of meals for school children or the supply of milk for mothers andbabies are adequate to the needs of the situation and thereare of course areas outside the operations of the DistressFund where conditions may be serious.The action which I can take ahd propose forthwith to take is to issue a circular to Boards of Guardians impressing on them the need for humane administration during this difficult period.     I have not in mind at the moment any alteration of the law or orders regulating the administration of poor relief but certain relaxations on detailed points of administration which are possible under the law or orders as they stand.There then arises the question whether, further aid from Exchequer funds should or should not be provided this winter.     I remain of the opinion that it should be so provided and that the arrangements should be on the general lines of the memorandum which I sent to the Chancellor with the exception that they must be extended to areas outside the mining areas, but without prejudice to a maximum expenditure which I put at  500,000 for England and V/ales only.      I should observe that if such arrangements be made, it will then be possible to avoid claims for Exchequer assistance from those areas where the Boards of Guardians though desirous of relaxing their practice on the lines above indicated may be unable to do so for reasons of financial stringency.(Intd.)

WINTER     D I 5 T R. E.S S.STATEMENT TO BE PLACED BEFORE HIMIBTJ&amp;t OF HEivLTH BY DEPUTATION OF STANDING JOINT COMMITTEE OF INDUSTRIAL WOMEN&apos;S ORGANISATIONS ON DECEMBER 5th 1929, at 12 of clock.1. The Standing Joint Committee represents women in thefollowing organisations:-Labour Party, General Council of the Trades Union Congress, Co-operative Union, Women&apos;s Co-operative Guild, Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society (Political Committee), N.U. Railway Womeh&apos;s Guild, Workers&apos; Union, National Union of General and Municipal Workers, Railway Clerks&apos; Association, National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers, Transport and General Workers&apos; Union, Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries, National Union of Clerks and Administrative Workers, National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Fabian Society, National Union of Boot and Shoo Operatives, The Amalgamated Union of Tailors and Garment Workers, National Society of Pottery Workers, Independent Labour Party, Women Sanitary Inspectors and Health Visitors&apos; Association, A.S.L.E.F. Women&apos;s Society.It thus covers over one million working women and represents the threefold organisation of the Political, Co-operative and Labour Movements.We have the full support of the Executive Committee of the Labour Party in putting forward the proposal in the following statement.    (See Paragraph 5,)2. The S.J.C at the beginning of the winter of 1928-9urged that special steps should be taken to protect the health of the children who as a result of distress due to unemployment were many of them Ill-clad and Ill-shod. It was on their Initiative that a Bill empowering Local Authorities to provide Boots for children under and of School Age towards the cost of which a grant from national funds would be made of 90$ was promoted.     The Bill In order to secure support from women M.P&apos;s. on all sides of the House was narrowed in its scope1 to the areas of special distress.     The Government of the day however net the /
the demand by a proposal to give a  1 for  1 grant to the. Lord Mayor1 s Fund up to a  1,000,000 grant.   The S.J.C. though dissatisfied with the method, was unable to do anything more.   It now acmes to the Minister of a Labour Government to ask what they will do under the somewhat similar circumstances this winter.3.     ^he position with regard to the Lord Mayor5s Fund is unsatisfactory for the following reasons:-(a) ^he area of distress is arbitrarily and often very unjustly drawn.    Thus there may be 2 families normally working at the same pit, but because they live in different areas, the one family may be assisted and the other not.   Moreover some areas where there is acute distress are not includedat all.(b) The Fund is almost exhausted.   We understand that there will be no further allocations in the Durham area.   In South Waie3, with the added need due to the Floods, there will be totally inadequate provision.&apos;(c)   A further appeal to oharity is not only veryhumiliating to the people in distress but we fear would not under present conditions be fruitful.(d) Though the administrative machinery is now much better than at first, it is still very inquisitorial and ineffective in its methods.(e) The use of this charitable fund for clothing workers who are coming under the Transferenceor/SMmmmmmmitmm..... i-^^^^mHMM^W^^-sm^v^ri^!
or Training Schemes is in our opinion not right.   It uses money contributed for somewhat different purposes. 4.     We note with great pleasure that the figures for registered unemployed are considerably lower than last year and we look forward to better administrative methods of Unemployment Benefit to help in the prevention of some part of the distress.   We realise that Unemployment schemes of public work are likely to take some time in coming into full operation and we therefore must regretfully point out that there is bound to be great distress during this winter.   It will we believe be leas than last year. But many families, having gone through still another year of acute poverty, will be still further in need of warm olothing, bedding and nourishing food.? 5. We therefore urge that the Government shouldwithout delay make arrangements for assistance through Local Authorities from public funds to those who are in distress due to unemployment.   We urge that this assistance should be specially directed so that these people may secure nourishing food, clothing, boots and fuel and that special attention bo given to theneeds of expectant mothers and children below school age whose need is very acute and often unnoticed and to young single workers without homea of their own for whom place a in the Training Centrea under the Ministry of Labour have not been available and who are in a very desolate situation.   In our opinion the need is acute andshould/

MORPETH ( NOROJRuMBERIARD).Practically this whdle area is suffering from   distress being wholly miningi. ..,Child of seven going to school crying for bread only last week.Is the Coalfields Distress. Fund, operating-in your area? Ii it is, can you send us any circulars issued by it dealing with distribution in your area at present?Yes.     The last award to this district was  600. I understand they provide outfits for men starting work, and girls going to Service.     Great dissatisfaction has always prevailed in this district to the method of distribution.     So much so that the Urban District Counci. has protested more than once.3.   Do you know whether your local Coalfields Distress Committee was asked by the Central Committee what assistance would be needed from the Fund during this winter?I don*t know. I beve tried time ah&amp;j again to obtain knowledge of the work, this eommitteo is doing but can never get to know anything very definite.4*   Is there distress which is not being mat and; what is its nature?     Can you give any special instances?Great distress prevails amongst the miners families.. (This district is  absolutely mining)..    The wages being very.small, these people get no relief from &quot;Mansion Fund&quot;.     Cases where men have as little as sevenpeuce to take home after deductions.     In my experience   have never known so much distress.5.   Do the Poor Law Guardians give Out Relief to single young men?Our Board do not grant any relief to single young men, they are all offered the workhouse, we have several of them inside just now.6.   Do the P-or Lav/ Guardians give Out Relief to able-bodied married men as well as to their wives and children?Ho relief to able-bodied men is granted by our Board and our scale for the wife is pitifully low (6/6 per week)    3/- If paying rent.
90Ae*&apos; O O7.   ire there any complaints that mothers and babies cannot get milk?Have not heard of any lately but had a . fight for them to get it.     Have now Labour majority on Urban District Council which makes things easier.8.   Have you any other observations to make?Should be glad if relief could be sent here for the winter, we &quot;succeeded last winter in helping a number of cases that: &quot;^&quot;&quot;refused by Mansion House committee.NAME.

3.    Is the Coalfields Distress Fund operating in your area?If it is, can you send us any circulars issued by it dealing with distributi on-in your-area-at.present?The Mansion &quot;Fund has done ^splendidly.   Last allowance we had a little over  6,000, but this allowance &quot;&quot;we have had  1,000 with other- 228 to o-omo-before 2mas^ which I understand will be the finish.    We .cannot possibly do all the cases &quot;who are eligible-.3.     Do you know-whet her yourJLooal Coalfields Distress &apos;t)oinmi-t^ee&apos; was asked by-the Central Committee what &quot;assistance would be needed from the Fund during this winter?If by this you mean the Mansion Fund - Yes, and they have allowed on the number of unemployed as far as the Fund would allow.    Last winter we had a consignment of old clothes, which helped considerably.4.    is there distress which is not balng met and what is its nature?   Can you give any special instances?Yes. Bedding.   We have not been able to give muoh bedding, which to my knowledge is urgently needed; had we had the same allowance as last (say  6,000) we did intend giving everyone in need a pair of blankets.5.   Do the poor Law Guardians give Out Relief to single young men?No.    Therefore the looal Council do their best to give the single men what work they can, especially where the unemployment pay is stopped, so as-to get them their allowance - again.6.    Do the poor law Guardians give Oat Relief to able-bodied married men as well as to their wives and children?They give relief up to the amount of the Unemployment pay.    In this area it is a purely Labour Guardian, and the Central Board has a majority of Labour and they do all that the law allows for persons on relief.Yes,    Dip ton particularly as many of these men folk have not worsed for five years, and the people who are -working are in many cases worse off than when they were on the unemployed insurance.   So many of them are on Guardian rslief and that only gets them bars necessaries after paying their rent.
7.   Are there any Yhmr&amp;adotrS &quot;that motJoeT?*-and.Jbabd^a. jfta^mot get milk?No.      The M. &amp; C. W. in Durham County has been a Godsend to mothers and children up to June;    it is only tho mothers&apos; fault if they do not receive assistance here out of the Mansion Fund.     We have had in Durham  1,000 to send mothers to convalescent homes;    also they have had butter, eggs and milk, and the clothes have been got for them through the Mansion Fund.8.    Have you any dther observations to make?I know you will understand that when a mother does get,  say,  1.0.0. for herself and 10s. a head for her children it does not get her a change of under-clothing and boots.     We laid it down that children must have boots first.      I think the greatest need is for bedding and for boots where needed.     I am sorry I cannot send you a list of all the amounts of money wo have expended, but will send you the last one.

DIVISIONAL OFFICE, Circular No.12.I Issued, to the Honorary secretaries of the Durham and Northumberland local Committees of the Coalfields 11 stress Funds)._JCOALFIELDS I1STR333 FUNDS (Including the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund).T*l^phon* 5066 Central,81. at. Lary&apos;8 Place,Newc astle-upon-Tyne.20th September, 1929.3CAL3 TO B2 USED FBOM 1st QCT033B. 1929.Circular No.7. was intended to emphasise the necessity for restricting the operations of the Fund * save in a few quite exceptional circumstances, to the assistance of families of unemployed persons, and for excluding its application to those of men in full time work, even though their wages might be considered too low.     Under existing rules, there is no maximum limit to the scale in operation/ and assistance is given, provided there is a large family, in cases where the gross income, less rent, is as high as 40/- and over, i.e. where it, in fact, exceeds the amount that many men earn when in full time employment.     This arrangement appears to be in conflict with the principle explained in Circular No.7.as the result of a suggestion from the Lord Mayor of London and the Central Committee, the Divisional Committee for the Northern Coalfield have decided to modify the existing scale before general distribution from the Fund is resumed in the autumn.If it may be assumed that a figure of 44/- per week represents a fair average weekly wage for an unskilled labourer in Northumberland and lurham for a full working week, and if 10/- per week can be regarded as a reasonable deduction to be made for rent and rates, then a figure of 34/- Is indicated as a maximum figure for the standard net income limit, provided no margin is to be left between the smnloyed and unemployed man.     Obviously some margin must be left, apart from the fact that men in employment have to meet certain compulsory or quasi-compulsory charges on their earnings (such as insurance premiums, trade union subscriptions eta.), which need not fall upon men out of emnloyment. In these circumstances, therefore, a maximum figure for the standard net income limit in excess of 33/- cannot be accented,suggest that the following scale and the Central Committee should be adopted . Household of 2and12child children20/-34/-27/-30/-or-over.&quot;33/-net income,
9 O r3. The Divisional Committee are satisfied that the abovescale will j^oi normally exclude the family of any unemployed , man from being regarded as eligible for assistance from the Fund.      xhey also wish to take this opportunity of emphasising again that the income limit standard should not be applied rigidly and automatically.     Whilst it is intended to serve as a general guide, it will be for the Local and Ward Committees to exercise a wise discretion in particular cases according to circumstances, not only as regards the inclusion of cases nominally outside the scale, but also as regards the exclusion of cases nominally within it.( igd . )   J.Y7.

.7? f fl^    (L/HIE DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;   GO VERMONT.)GRANTS TO NECESSITOUS AREAS. Draft Cabinet--Memorandum by Minister of^ Health.I desire to consult my colleagues as to our policy with regard to what are known as the necessitous areas during the coming winter.At the present time some of the Local Authorities in the coal fields are in the most acute financial difficulties.     Their rate poundage in several cases exceeds 25/- in the  , there are heavy arrears^of rates and owing to the prevalent distress it is impossible for them to collect sufficient in rates to meet their current expenditure.In these circumstances It is clearly impossible for them to discharge adequately their functions in regard to the health and well-being of their population, and I am satisfied that we must do something to help them.It will be recollected that the late Governments method of meeting the situation during the past winter was to make a   for   grant to the Mansion House Fund for the relief of Distress in the Mining Areas.This fund was administered by local committees and was applied largely to th,e* provision of boots and clothing, but also for such purposes as special emergency grants in cases of sickness or to enable recipients to undertake fresh employment, for extra nourishmenty for employment and welfare schemes for single men, Supplementary feeding of school children, transfer of juveniles from the depressed areas and allotments.1.
/M13i jl Jlf/ The total receipts amounted to  1,700,000,and I understand  600,000 is ,available for distributioni .    Cm&quot;-&apos;:this winter.I am clear that both from a political point of view and on general grounds of principle we should not continue to work through the Lord Mayor &apos;s Fund.Widespread distress arising from national causes should be tackled nationally and not left to private charity even when assisted by grants from Exchequer Funds.But it has to be recognised that any attempt to deal with the problem by government action bristles with difficulties.     The question has been before my predecessors almost constantly in recent years and they have none of them felt themselves able to recommend a scheme to the Government of the day.But I have come to the conclusion that notwithstanding the difficulties, something must be done i and I have given much anxious consideration to the question of how the problem should be tackled.^I at first explored the possibility of making a grant to the Local Authorities in the distressed areas which would enable some reduction to be made in the rates, but I am advised that any such proposal would require legislation, and in the present congested state of Parliamentary business and in view of the urgency of the matter, any such solution must be ruled out of court.Then I examined the possibility of grants based cn bulk figures of expenditure estimated to be
incurred during the current half year.     This is difficult to devise and is open to criticism as a direct incentive to Local Authorities to spend more money irrespective of need.     Alternatively, it would not go far enough where Local Authorities cannot afford to spend what they are already spending.     Moreover, it would have awkward repercussion on the scheme of the Local Government Act, 1929, which comes into operation on the 1st April next, and incidentally provides a considerable amount of new exchequer money for these very areas.     The scheme of that Act may or may not be found to require amendment, but I think that until we see what its effect will be, it would be undesirable to take steps which would prejudice its working in advance.In the result I have decided to reoommend to my colleagues the scheme set out in the Appendix to this paper.It will be seen that the main outline of the scheme is to take throe specific services, which may be regarded as among the most vital, namely the provision of boots and clothing, the feeding of school children, and the provision of milk for children under 5 and expectant and nursing mothers., and to secure that, subject to certain safeguards (including a maximum sum of money), the balance required to provide what is reasonably necessary under these three heads beyond what tho Local Authorities can themselves afford in their present financial circumstances shall be met by the Exchequer.
I think that this scheme oan he defended on the ground that it will enable adequate provision to he made for services which command general sympathy, and cannot otherwise be provided by the responsible Looal Authorities, while at the same time it avoids a subsidy in aid of scales of poor relief, which I am satisfied would be fraught with danger.But at the same time I feel bound to warn my colleagues that even the present proposal is full of difficulties, as ^naeau is any proposal dealing with this most awkward subjectBIn the first place, I propose that it should be limited to Local Authorities in the coalfields, and this will inevitably lead to feelings of resentment on the part of Local Authorities outside the coal areas who are themselves in financial straits which feelings will probably be accentuated if they see the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund still operating only in the coalfields.   But I do not see how we can extend the scheme to other areas as it would then be impossible to know ^ere to draw the line. Whatever the defects of the limitation proposed, it is at least fairly clear cut.   Again the scheme is nothing more or less than a 100 per cent exchequer grant and whatever safeguards we attempt to impose, the objections to such a proposal are so obvious that they need not be elaborated.But as the essence of the plan is that the Looal Authorities are so embarrassed financially that they cannot be asked to provide any extra money out of the rates, it is difficult to see what other basis could be adopted.Moreover, the grant proposed is a grant for current expenditure.   It oan at least be said in reapeot of a capital grant that once given it is done with; but in/the
the oase of a grant for current expenditure, it should logically continue so long as the necessity lasts, and the appetite of Local Authorities is likely to grow rather than fail and to extend e.g. to Unemployment Grants.Notwithstanding these difficulties, I recommend the proposal to my colleagues as on the whole the best way of meeting the position.(Init:)      A.
