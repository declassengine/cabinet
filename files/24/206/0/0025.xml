STATE FOR WAR.- Active enquiries are now being made from several quarters with a view to the      57 purchase from my Department of surplus arms, especially rifles&apos; and machine ^un&apos;s&apos;, for       8 ultimate supply to the Chinese government. &quot;&apos; &apos;J &quot;&quot;&quot;&apos;    &quot; &apos;n;i  :J-       3489I am well aware of the arguments against permitting such sales to take place, but there is another point of view which I wish to take this opportunity of placing before my colleagues in&apos; order that a considered decision may be arrived at as to the manner in which these applications should be met. I accordingly attach a memorandum on this question which has been prepared in my Department, bringing out the advantages to&quot; he gained by permitting such sales to take place. &quot;T. S.The War Office,5th October, 1929.MEMORANDUM BY THE WAR OFFICE.1. A summary of relevant Cabinet decisions since April, 1924, is attached. (Annexure A.) &quot;   &apos;2. From the standpoint of broad policy, there are, it is submitted, certain considerations in favour &quot;of permitting the sale of surplus munitions to foreign Governments : (1) The main case for prohibiting these sales presumably lies in the moral value of such a step:as a gesture in favour of disarmament. But there appears to be little real virtue in a&apos; Government refusing to&apos; be a party to the supply of arms to other: Governments, when it impdsesno limitation of any kind in this matter up0n:iitself, ;but; continues (as it necessarily must&apos; in -the absence of an accepted general scheme of&apos;international disarmament) to obtain such arms as it&apos;desires; both by manufacture In its Qwn&apos;factories and by purchase from its own armament firms and, when necessary, lfrom abroad. 1 a(2) In any case/such a prohibition can hardly, it is ^ubmittedjhe regarded as either &apos; &apos; logical or effective !as a moi&apos;al gesture so long as British armament firms are not:&apos;prohibited from- manufacturing -munitions &quot;for export to foreign Govern -ments. Our own sales are insignificant in relation to&quot; the transactions of the armament &quot;firms, the&apos;&quot;former having&apos; amounted in 6 years only to about  l(V0,000:(apart from  233,000 in respect&quot;of a!sale of rifles to Afghanistan now iikely to prove abortive) while the &quot;latter have&quot; amounted to  1,828,000 -during&apos;1929. ::,&apos;-;f;    1On the other hand, to prohibit sales by the armament firms to foreign Governments would &apos; leave these firms entirely dependent on British Government orders with the result that, &quot;if they did not go out of business altogether, they&quot;1&apos;&apos;vvould either reduce their&quot; productive capacity to the minimum needed to meet our peace requirements (thus leaving us without(B39/17)   75 &quot;10/39 &quot;W.0.PT 1(589 &quot; &quot;
any reserve capacity to fall back on in case of war), or else would demand heavy subsidies for tbe maintenance of such capacity, while foreign countries which did not impose a similar restriction would benefit by. the orders previously secured by our firms. (3) Prohibition of the sale to foreign Governments of our surplus stocks would not prevent those Governments from obtaining munitions, either from armament firms in this country (unless that also were prohibited) or from other countries. In the absence of an international agreement to adopt a similar policy, the only result of taking this step-apart from such moral significance as it might possess would be to benefit foreign countries, both in finances and in increased employment, at our own expense.3. If the above arguments are sound, it follows that, however appropriate&apos;it might be to include, as a feature of an3&apos; scheme of international disarmament, a general prohibition of the sale by the signatory Governments of their surplus munitions, the effect of the British Government binding itself, in the absence of corresponding action by other Powers, by a self-denying ordinance of this kind unaccompanied by any restriction upon the exporting activities of armament firms in this country or elsewhere, or. upon its own power to manufacture, such stores or obtain them by purchase either at home or abroad;  would merely be to place Great Britain in a disadvantageous position in relation to other Governments, and incidentally to expose it to a charge of inconsistency, without achieving anything in the nature of a really effective gesture on behalf of disarmament.4. Such a prohibition, moreover, would be far in advance of any international action hitherto contemplated. Two international instruments have, in fact, been drawn up affecting traffic in arms, viz. :  ....,(a) The Convention for the Supervision of the International Trade in Arms andAmmunition and Implements of War* ; and(b) The Draft Convention with regard to the Supervision of the Private manufacture and Publicity of the Manufacture of Arms and Ammunition and of Imple-ments of War,neither of which seeks to prohibit the sale of surplus warlike stores by governments to other governments.These two instruments are, however, not yet in force. The Traffic in Arms Convention has been signed on behalf of Great Britain, but has not been ratified. The draft Convention on Private Manufacture has not yet. been considered by a plenary conference. It would seem inconsistent to reach a decision regarding the sale of surplus warlike stores which goes further even than would the international agreements themselves, if and when brought into operation.5. From a departmental point of view, there are important advantages in retaining &quot;the power of sale of surplus munitions.(1) Prohibition of sale would entail a considerable financial sacrifice, though one of which it is impossible tq give an estimate of any value, in view of the extreme uncertainty of,the demand, , It is true that, as mentioned above, the amount actually realised;since 1923 has not been very large, but the disposable assets include certain items,of high potential value ; in particular, e.g., the stock of 1914 rifles, if atpurchaser could be found, (and ,seA-eral times&apos;during the last few years we have seemed to be on the brink of a firm deal), might well realise, l,000,00Q. Moreover, the cost of storing and caring for stores held as surplus is ,by. no means negligible,; and, they are subject to continuous depreciation in value,.through.obsolescence and loss of condition ; the process of breaking, them down.to a form in which they could be safely marketed as scrap would he extremely expensive..       ,.    In particular, enquiries have recently been made by contractors (acting for agents of the Chinese Government) whose requirements are Firm.	Rifles.	Lewis guns.	Ammunition.B.S.A Guns, Ltd.      ...      ...... A. Field &amp; Co., Ltd.   ...      .7. Gellatly Hankey &amp; Co., Ltd.......	100,000 350,000	5,000 2,500	10,000,000 100,000,000 350,000,000* A memorandum by the War Office on this subject is being circulated separately, CP. 276 (29).
It is not known whether these figures are mutually exclusive, but the War Office have large stocks of surplus rifles and Lewis guns which are slowly depreciating, for the disposal of which this seems an excellent opportunity. Assuming the quantities issued were 350,000 rifles and 5,000 Lewis guns,, Army Funds might expect to benefit to the extent of rather over  1,000,000. Apart from the direct receipts from the sale of these arms, their disposal would release valuable storage accommodation and save other expense of storage. Moreover, the sale of these &quot;rifles and Lewis guns would mean that the Chinese Government - would depend upon Great Britain for ammunition, as it would have to be rimmed and this country has practically a monopoly in the manufacture of this type of ammunition. Thus there would accrue to this country the economic advantage of manufacturing future supplies of ammunition for export to China. With regard to the present demand for ammunition, there would be obvious advantages in meeting it as far as possible and replacing army stocks in so far as it is necessary by manufacture.(2) The prohibition would preclude the sale not only of surplus stores, but also of all army equipment as it becomes obsolete, thus making it impossible to realise receipts which would help to meet the cost of more.up-to-date equipment ; with the result that the whole cost, instead of only part of the cost of the latter would have to be met as a new charge. This means that the process of re-equipment would necessarily be retarded, with effects adverse to military efficiency.(3) There is considerable military advantage in inducing foreign armies to adopt armament of British design, as once this has been adopted the power to refuse supplies which cannot be obtained elsewhere if homogeneity of equip-hieht is to be maintained, presents a potential means of influencing the policy of &quot;the country concerned.(4) As the proceeds of the sale of surplus or obsolescent stores would normally assist towards placing orders for new equipment, such sales would pro tanio directly tend to, relieve unemployment, since there is no probability that the foreign Governments who are the most likely purchasers of our stores would, if the latter were not on the market, be able to afford to place orders in this country for the corresponding new equipment. In addition a certain a mount * of additional employment would be likely to accrue in the course of time in the form of orders to Great Britain for replacements and repairs as an indirect result of the adoption by those Governments of equipment of British design.6. An early decision is requested in view of the demands referred to in paragraph 5 (1), action oh which has been suspended pending a decision on the general policy.
ANNEXURE A.Summary, qe Cabinet decisions since April, 1924, in relation to the question qe the disposal oe surplus, warlike stores.1. Oh 15th april 1924, after consideration of a Treasury memorandum on the Control of Sales of Arms, the Cabinet agreed (Cabinet 27 (24), Conclusion 5) (a.) That the disposal of Government-owned arms and munitions of war to foreign States, whether directly or through private contractors, should not in future be sanctioned ;(fi) That, as a corollary to the above decision, such superfluous stocks as had not been or could not be made use of by the Service Departments or disposed of to the Dominions, Colonies, &amp;c, should be destroyed.2. On 25th June, 1924, the Chancellor of the. Exchequer circulated a memorandum (CP. 360 (24)) asking for a decision upon two points of interpretation arising out of the Cabinet decision referred to above : -(a) Was. the sale of machine gun parts to Messrs. Vickers, for incorporation in guns tp be supplied to Russia^ prohibited by the Cabinet decision ?(5) Did the Cabinet decision limit sales to Dominion and Colonial Governments, or were sales in the Dominions and Colonies permissible subject to strict precautions for the prevention of re-export to foreign destinations ?3. On 10th July, 1924, the Seoretary of State for Air circulated a memorandum (OP. 393 (24)) asking for the views of his colleagues regarding a proposed sale of British aircraft (not being surplus Government property) to the Persian Government.4. On 15th July, 1924, the Cabinet re-affirmed the principles laid down in their previous decision of 15th April, and set up a Standing Committee, composed of the Lord President of the, Council, the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretaries of State for War and Air, and the President of the Board of Trade, to consider any question referred to it, whether by the Cabinet or by any Government Department, in regard to the interpretation of that decision.    (Cabinet 41 (24), Conclusion 7.)5. On Hist July, 1924, this Standing Committee decided against the sales of machine gun parts, to Messrs, Vickers and of aircraft to Persia (paragraphs&apos;2 (a) and 3 above), but agreed to. the disposal of munitions to contractors for sale in Dominions or Colonies (paragraph 2 (6)), subject to the Government of the Dominion or Colony being informed and to special precautions against .re-exportation. They also ruled that the Cabinet decision was not retrospective, and did not bar the completion of a contract entered into by a Government Department before 15th April, 1924, for the sale of arms, &amp;c, to a foreign Government.6. On 12th November, 1924 (after the change of Ministry), the Cabinet decided that approval should not be given to acceptance by Messrs. Vickers of a contract to supply arms and ammunition to the value of  7,500,000 to the Soviet Government (Cabinet 59 (24)). On 5th January, 1925, after consideration of a memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade (OP. 2 (25)), they re-affirmed the decision not to sanction the equipment of Soviet Russia with munitions of British manufacture, and ruled that it applied to the export of arms already licensed (Cabinet 1 (-5), Conclusion 9). On 21st January (Cabinet 3 (25), Conclusion 8), they referred to the&quot; President of the Board of Trade and the Chancellor of the Exchequer the question of compensation to contractors arising out of this-dee-ision, and on 1st July (Cabinet 32 (25), Conclusion 12), they decided to refuse the claims for such compensation.7. On 18th February, 1925, the Cabinet decided, after consideration of a memo-randum by the Secretary of State for War (OP. 15 (2o) ) That the Service Departments should be authorized to take steps to find markets for the surplus and obsolescent equipment amongst the allied and friendly powers eithei? directly or through private contractors who are recognized dealers, and that the decisions of th*e late Cabinet on i 5th April, 1924 (Cabinet 27 (24), Conclusion 5), and 15th July, 1924 (Cabinet 41 (24), Conclusion 7), forbidding the sale of surplus Government arms and munitions to foreign States and ordering their destruction if they could not be made use of by the Services or sold to the Dominions or Colonies, should be cancelled (Cabinet 9 (25), Conclusion 5).
8. On 7th August, 1925, the Cabinet decided that proposals to grant applications for export licence covering a period longer than 3 months (where the Service Depart-ments, the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade were agreed that they were not open to objection) should not be acted upon until they had been laid before the Cabinet. (Cabinet 44 (25), Conclusion 12).9. On 19thJanuary, 1926, the Cabinet agreed that the decision of 12th November, 1924, prohibiting the supply of war material to Russia should be reconsidered in cases where the war material was of a purely defensive character (Cabinet 1 (26), Conclusion 5) ; and on 29th January, they decided to allow Messrs. Vickers to supply that country with small coast defence vessels and submarine mines.   (Cabinet 2 (26), Conclusion 6).10. At various dates in 1927 and 1928 the Cabinet agreed to the grant of long term licences : (a) To B.S.A. Gruns Ltd., for warlike stores to Japan,(b) To Nobel Industries Ltd., for warlike stores to Yugo Slavia,(c) To Nobel Industries Ltd., for ammunition to Turkey,with an intimation in each case that the licence would not be withdrawn &quot; save in the event of circumstances of an altogether exceptional character arising which the Board of Trade are at present quite unable to foresee.&quot; (Cabinet 18 (27), 36 (27), 20 (28), Conclusions 17, 9 and 16, respectively.)
