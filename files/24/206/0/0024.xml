QOUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITAfi&amp;IO MAJ.dSTYTo G^VERIuyISNT ).JR ET 4 .(29)CABIN E&apos; T,COPY m.  SjfMINING   ROYALTIES.Memorandum prepared in the Treasury.Circxilated by direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade.1. Themain question is when and how the mineral rights in coalare to be acquired by the State.2. There are various possible schemes.One alternative would be to take over both the ownership,and the administrative responsibility, of all mineral rights in coal, bothdeveloped and undeveloped, simultaneously on one day.    This at first sight seems simple but in fact is full of practical difficulties dealt with below.On the other hand there is the plan advocated by the Mines Department under which the mineral rights are taken over by the State only as practical advantage demands.    Under this plan no new grant of rights could be made except by the State, but undeveloped minerals ould be taken over only when they were about to be worked, and inerals at present in lease would be acquired only as and when xisting leases ran out, unless in any case there was any practical  vantage to be gained by earlier acquisition (e.g.  for the purpose f varying a lease,  consolidating a number of leases, rearranging oundaries etc.)    In such cases the State would have power to acquire he never it thought fit.The advantages of the Mines Department; plan are  chat it preads the acquisition over a number of years.    There would be o necessity to value ail minerals within a limited time; no flood f doubtful and petty claims for compensation; tvO serious addition o the national debt at any one time; no vast distribution of mor o royalty owners at any one time; existing leases of minerals and face would not ordinarily have to he examined     d their rights
ISOand obligations analysed and divided;    the questions of staff and organisation would be immensely simplified;    and at the same time the whole of the &quot;utilitarian&quot; case for nationalisation of the minerals would have been met0The ^political&quot; disadvantage of this scheme is that, subject to the operation of the proviso, the acquisition of some of the minerals now on lease may be postponed for as much as 50 years.      The average unexpired length of existing leases is nearly 30 years.3. The &quot;gradual&quot; scheme could be modified in various ways...All coal now in lease could be acquired immediately and simultaneously, the acquisition of undeveloped or unlet coal being postponed until an application to work it is received.      This how-ever would leave the immediate cost as say  70 millions and the practical difficulties of administration and valuation would still be very formidable.Another plan, designed primarily to meet this latter point, would be for the State to be empowered to take over all coal, or all developed coal, as fast as it was ready to take over its administra-&quot;fcion, by separate notice in respect of each area or each colliery undertaking.     Any plan which tends to lessen the difficulties of ^taking over&apos;  is worth consideration.     There are however objections to airy scheme which leaves the present royalty owners in control for a short and indefinite period, and without any interest in the future of the property.The scheme could, again, be varied so as to make the legal ownership in all developed coal pass at once over to the State but leaving the present owner to continue the collection of royalties etc.  (as agent of the State) until the State is ready actually to take over.      But there is more in the management,  even of an existing lease, than the mere collection of royalties, and it is difficult to visualise such a plan working very Batisfactorily.     The Mines Department &quot;gradual&quot; plan is not entirely free from this objection but it is more free from it than the variants of it just discussedc
Imme d i at e s imu It ane ou 3 pur chas e.4.      This policy &quot;cannot be carried through without the payment of compensation to existing owners of at any rate  70-millions and possibly  100 millions in some form or other0 One course would be to give each owner an annuity for a term years, but it is probable that payment in perpetual Government stock would have to be conceded.      The former course would probably have rather less serious effect on Government credit than the latter.      It would In any circumstances be extremely desirable to avoid this heavy new issue of Government obliga-tions, but the present moment is specially unpropitiouso     We have to contemplate borrowing on a big scale in the next six months to deal with heavy debt maturities next spring and also if possible to reduce the total of Treasury Bills which is swollen and dangerous.     These operations must be made more -expensive and even impossible by a fresh creation of Government securities in payment for mineral royalties.Nor is it clear that immediate simultaneous purchase at an early date is a manageable proposition from an adminis-trative point of view. There would be great difficulties in improvising the large staff required more particularly as most or all of the experts whose services would be essential to the Government would at the start be fully occupied in the service of their present employers in pressing claims to compensation,.Undeveloped Mineralsa5,      Under the Mines Department plan the purchase of undeveloped minerals would be postponed until they came to be worked or leased.     They say - &quot;It might be possible-to attach to the scheme a proviso that nothing should be paid for any coal the existence of which cannot be proved within 5 year3 from the passing of the Act to have a commercial value&quot;.    With
some such safeguard, which is essential, there is no difficulty under their plan in dealing with undeveloped minerals.Under a plan for simultaneous immediate acquisition the position would be as follows.      The valuation of undeveloped minerals is profoundly speculative in every way but particularly because the valuer must judge the length of time that is likely to elapse before they are developed.     How the amount of coal which will actually be worked in the next 5C or 100 years depends on the demand for coal:  it may be a fraction only of our undeveloped resources.      If it is left to a Tribunal tc give compensation to the individual owners of all these undeveloped resources the State will fare very ill and the only remedy would be to fix by Act the total compensation which the Government is prepared to give under this head, leaving it to a Tribunal to distribute the total among the different claimants.The Inland Revenue think that it may be possible to arrive by recognised processes of valuation at a total -likely to be in the neighbourhood of  24 million - which if inserted In the Act as the over-riding figure could be supported by closely reasoned arguments.      This is a practical method of handling the matter.      It raises political difficulties&quot; as on the one hand the over-riding figure will be denounced by the Conservatives as confiscation:    on the other hand the Liberals may manoeuvre to appear more democratic than the Government and attack the payment for undeveloped minerals at all. .An alternative is to take over all undeveloped minerals paying nothing for any of them - in fact to confiscate them.      In considering this it must be remembered that many such minerals have a definite commercial value, and that of these some have recently-changed hands by purchase at a price and some have puid death duties  (it may be at high rates) on official valuations.
\. S 3Points for decision,,Whether the plan is to be the.Mines Department plan or immediate simultaneous acquisition or any of the inter-mediffte plans suggested in paragraph 3?In the event of a decision for immediate simult miscellaneous acquisition, whether the plan should provide a lump sum for compensation fox&apos; undeveloped minerals (Paragraph 5)?By what date must draft legislation be ready?There are very many difficult administrative questions which await settl- ment,  connected with &quot;dead rontc&quot;, the title to property In the coal shaft and surface buildings and other matters.      These unsolved ouestions involve very large suras and raise many points of controversy and It may prove difficult to hrve workable solutions in time for a very early bill.Is the State property in the mineral rights when acquired to be managed by an existing Government Department or is a new permanent Board or Commission to be set up?The latter course may be held to be desirable in view of constant pressure from coal owners and miners to reduce.or suspend royalties whenever they are in difficulties.      The income to be managed will be about  5,000,000 a year.   .Treasury Chambers,  S.W.I. October 15th, 1929.
