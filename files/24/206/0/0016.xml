MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.Following the suggestions made by Lord Irwin when he was invited to the Cabinet in July, the subsequent discussion on 25th September, and consultation between the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Irwin and myself, the following proposals are made.Lord Irwin on his return to India will announce: (a) A Free Conference.That after the Simon Commission have submitted their Report and the Govern-ment have been able, in consultation with the Government of India, to consider the matter in the light of all the material available, His Majesty&apos;s Government will summon in London a Conference of representatives of different parties and interests in British India and of representatives of the Princes. (This Conference will take place before any proposals are formulated by the Government.)(6) A Declaration of Purpose.That, in the judgment of His Majesty&apos;s Government, it is implicit in the Declaration of 1917 that the attainment of Dominion status must be regarded as the natural issue of India&apos;s constitutional progress.The Prime Minister suggested that, on the issue of such a statement, he should be interviewed in support of it.At the same time as Lord Irwin&apos;s statement is issued, correspondence will be published between Sir John Simon and the Prime Minister, suggesting that the Conference mentioned in (a) should take place. In this way the proposal for the change of procedure will originate with the Simon Commission itself.A provisional draft of the statement to be isisued by Lord Irwin and of the correspondence between Sir John Simon and the Prime Minister form Appendices I and II to this document.It is submitted that these proposals are dictated both by right and by expediency. (1) The Conference.&apos; Sir John Simon&apos;s Commission will have reviewed effectively a large part of the field, but, at least so far as its official sittings were concerned, there is no doubt that it was effectively boycotted. This boycott was practised, not only by members of the Congress Party, but by the Liberals and many of those leading Indians who have been co-operating with the Government, and have been responsible, on the Indian side, for whatever measure of success has attended the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms. I may mention as an example that even an Indian Member of the India Council declined on grounds of principle to give evidence before it. When the Simon Report has been received, therefore, the Government will still be left with a picture not wholly complete, until further means have been taken to ascertain the views of those sections of Indian opinion which have maintained silence.As a matter of expediency a helpful atmosphere for the operation of any future changes is more likely to exist if Indians have been allowed to express themselves fully at a stage in the proceedings when their opinion may be supposed to have weight, that is to say, before the Government has come even to jjrovisional conclusions.While the proposed Conference cannot from its nature assume the character of a negotiating body (for there will be no draft proposals on which to negotiate), there will be great weight in any agreement it reaches, for it must be remembered that it is intended to summon representatives, not only of the Hindu Nationalists, but. also of the Moslems and other classes in British India, as well as representatives of the Princes. In the light of the Simon Report and the discussions in the proposed Conference, all the inherent difficulties of the Indian problem will be brought out into the light of day. The delegates therefore will have, not the congenial and simple task of attacking the British Government, but the far more difficult, constructive and 395S      75   10.29[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.

helpful duty of settling their own differences. The role of the Government representatives will be that of attempting, where possible, to harmonise disagreement between the Indians and of summing up the results of the debates for the information of the Cabinet. ,The grave objection that the calling of this Conference might be held to be derogatory to the importance and authority of the Simon Commission has been completely overcome, because this new step originates in a letter from Sir John Simon with the concurrence of his Commissioners.(2) The Declaration.The promise to give responsible government to India was made in the famous statement of Mr. Montagu on 20th August 1917, and is embodied in the Preamble to the Act of 1919. The Simon Commission is appointed under section 84a of that Act. The repetition of the Preamble and a declaration of its implications cannot therefore be held to be any anticipation of the findings of the Commission appointed under the Act.The promise made to India under the pressure of war necessity in 1917 was no doubt distasteful to many, but it was not challenged in Parliamentary debate, and many official statements reaffirming it and of the highest authority have since been made. I would especially direct the attention of the Cabinet to Appendix III, which contains some of these statements. Of late years, however, there has been among Indian politicians a growing distrust of the sincerity of the declared intention of the British Government, and although there has been no repudiation in any British quarter of the oft-declared policy, there are no doubt many in this country who, to say the least, are halfhearted in their desire to make it effective.Whilst therefore it is patently impossible to grant the Congress demand for immediate Dominion status, it is desirable to reassert His Majesty&apos;s Governments sincere belief in the purpose set out in the Preamble and their determination so to shape their policj^ as to make it, as soon as may be, effective.In Mr. Montagu&apos;s words : &quot; Where did we start ? We started with the pronouncement of the 20th August 1917. 1 propose to ask : Is there anybody who questions to-day the policy of that pronouncement ? It is no use accepting it unless you mean it; it is no use meaning it unless you act upon it ; and it is no use acting upon it unless your actions are in conformity with it.&quot; June 1919.The Indian Situation.As the Cabinet is aware, the Indian National Congress has declared that, in the event of a failure to grant its demand by 31st December next, an extensive campaign * . of non-co-operation will be started. This campaign, if begun, would involve not only political disturbances, but tax-refusal on the model of the Bardoli dispute and also extensive strikes. For some years past there have been serious labour &quot;disturbances in Bombay. Recently 200,000 operatives were on strike in Calcutta, and I am informed that a General Strike in Calcutta is projected for the new year. The politicians, assisted by the Communists, will foster and use these troubles for their own ends. Further, as the Lahore case shows, a campaign of assassination may accompany mere public disturbance. The excited and unhealthy state of public opinion may be judged from the general approval given to the hunger strike of two men, Dntt and Singh, who had already been convicted of throwing bombs in the Assembly.The administrative outlook, therefore, is not bright. On the other hand, the understanding which existed between the Moslems and Hindus in 1921 has broken down, and the older leaders of Congress (whose influence is, however, rapidly declining) are not in their hearts sympathetic with extremist plans. In view of this situation a statement is needed which will re-establish faith in the sincerity of the British promise. Coupled with an invitation to Indian leaders to confer, such a statement may deprive the extremist section of their Liberal support and render their plans abortive. Such at least is our hope. In any case disorder can, and, of course, will be suppressed, although, as things are at present, extended powers may be needed for this purpbse. ... But it is inconceivable that the settled and permanent policy of,any British Government should be to hold India by force without attempting to win to the side of Government the support of thinking leaders of Indian opinion.W. B.3rd October 1929.
&quot;[ APPENDIX I.Draft Statement to be made by Lord Irwin.I have just returned from England where I have had the opportunity of prolonged consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government. Before I left this country I said publicly that as the King-Emperor&apos;s representative in India I should hold myself bound to tell my fellow-countrymen, as faithfully as I might, of lndia&apos;s feelings, anxieties asid aspirations. In my endeavours to discharge that undertaking I was assisted by finding, as I had expected, a generous and sincere desire, not only on the part of His i\lajesty&apos;s Government but on that of all persons and parties in Great Britain, to hear and to appreciate everything that it was my duty to represent.These are critical days, when matters by which men are deeply touched are in issue and when, therefore, it is inevitable that political feeling should run high, and that misunderstandings, which would scarcely arise in conditions of political tranquillity, should obtain firm foothold in men&apos;s minds. I have, nevertheless, not faltered in my belief that behind all the disquieting tendencies of the time, there lay the great mass of Indian opinion, overflowing all divisions of race, religion, or political thought, fundamentally loyal to the King-Emperor, and, whether consciously or not, only wanting to understand and to be understood. On the other side I have never felt any doubt that opinion in Great Britain, puzzled as it might be by events in India, or only perhaps partially informed as to their true significance, was unshaken in its determination that Great Britain should redeem to the full the pledges she has given for Indians future. On both countries the times have laid a heavy and&apos;in some ways a unique responsibility, for the influence on the world of a perfect understanding between Great Britain and India might surely be so great that no scales can give us the measure either of the prize of success or the price of failure in our attempts to reach it.In my discussions with the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State, it was inevitable that the principal topic should have been/the course of events in India. It is not profitable on either side to discuss to what extent, or with what justification, the appointment of a Parliamentary Commission two years ago has affected the general trend of Indian thought and action. Practical men must take facts and situations as they are and not as they would have them be.Sir John Simon&apos;s Commission, assisted as it has been by the Indian Central Committee, is now at work on its Report, and until that Report is laid before Parliament it is impossible, and even if it were possible, it would in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government clearly be improper, to forecast the nature of any constitutional changes that may subsequently be proposed. In this respect every British party is bound to preserve to itself complete freedom of action. But what must constantly engage our attention, and is a matter of deep concern to His Majesty&apos;s Government, is the discovery of means by which, when the Commission has reported, the broad question of British Indian constitutional advance may be approached in co-operation with all those who can speak authoritatively for opinion in British India. I would venture to recall some words which I used in addressing the Assembly eight months ago in a reference to the then existing political situation. &quot; On the one side,&quot; I said, &quot;it is as unprofitable to deny the right of Parliament to form its free and deliberate judgment on the problem as it would he short-sighted of Parliament to underrate the importance of trying to reach a solution which might carry the willing assent of political India.&quot; We shall surely stray from the path, at the end of which lies achievement, if we let go either one or other of these two main guiding principles of political action.But there has lately emerged, from a totally different angle, another set of considerations which is very relevant to what I have just stated ou this matter to be the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Chairman of the Commission has pointed out in correspondence with the Prime Minister, which, I understand, is being published in England, that as their investigation has proceeded, he and his colleagues have been greatly impressed, in considering the direction which the future constitutional development of India is likely to take, with the importance of bearing in mind the relations which may. at some future time, develop between British India and the Indian Stales. In his judgment it is essential that the methods, by which this future relationship between these two constituent parts of Greater India may be adjusted, should be fully examined. He has further expressed the opinion that if the Commission&apos;s Report and tne proposals subsequently, to be framed by the Government take this wider range, it; would appear necessary for the Government to revise the scheme of procedure as at present proposed. He suggests that what might be required, after the Reports of the Statutory Commission and the Indian Central Committee have been made and considered, but before the stage is reached of the Joint Parliamentary
Committee, would be the setting up of a Conference in which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should meet both representatives of British India and of the States, for the purpose of exchanging views in order that the final proposals, wlrioh; it will later be the duty of His Majesty&apos;s Government to submit to Parliament, may be supported by the greatest possible measure of agreement. The procedure by Joint Parliamentary Committee conferring with delegations from the Indian Legislature and other bodies, which was previously contemplated and is referred to in Sir John Simon&apos;s letter to myself of 6th&apos;February 1928, would still be appropriate for the examination of the Bill when it is subsequently placed before Parliament, but would, in the opinion of the Commission, obviously have to be preceded by some such Conference as they have suggested.With these views I understand that His Majesty&apos;s Government are in complete accord. For, while they Avill greatly desire, when the time comes, to be able to deal with the question of British Indian political development under conditions the most favourable to its successful treatment, they are, with the Commission, deeply sensible of the importance of bringing under comprehensive review the whole problem of the relations of British India and the Indian States. Indeed, an adjustment of these interests in their view is essential for the complete fulfilment of what they consider to be the underlying purpose of British policy, whatever may be the method for its furtherance which Parliament may decide to adopt.The goal of British policy was stated in the declaration of August 1917 to be that of providing for &quot; the gradual development of self-governing institutions, with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire.&quot; As I recently pointed out, my.own Instrument of Instructions from the tving-Emperor expressly states that it is His Majesty&apos;s will and pleasure that the plans laid by Parliament in 1919 should be the means hy which British India may attain its due place among His Dominions. Ministers of the Crown, moreover, have more than once publicly declared that it is the desire of the British Government that India should, in the fullness of time, take her place in the Empire in equal partnership with the Dominions. Bat in view of the doubts which have been expressed both in Great Britain and India regarding the interpretation to be placed on the intentions of the British Government in enacting the Statute of 1919, I am authorised on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government to state clearly that in their judgment it is implicit in the declaration of 1917 that the attainment of Dominion status must be regarded as the natural issue of India&apos;s constitutional progress.In the full realisation of this policy, it is evidently important that, the Indian States should be afforded an opportunity of finding their place, and even if we cannot at present exactly foresee on what lines this development may be shaped, it is from every point of view desirable that whatever can be done should be done to ensure that action taken now is not inconsistent with the attainment of the ultimate purpose which those, whether in&apos;British India or the States, who look forward to some unity of All India, have in view.His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that both these objects, namely, that of finding the best axjproach to the British Indian side of the problem, and secondly, of ensuring that in this process the wider question of closer relations in the future between the two parts of Greater India is not overlooked, can best be achieved by the adoption of procedure such as the Commission has outlined. When, therefore, the Commission and the Indian Central Committee have submitted their Reports, and His Majesty&apos;s Government have been able, in consultation with the Government, of India, to consider these matters in the light of all the material then available, they will propose to invite representatives of different parties and interests in British India and repre-sentatives of the Indian States to meet them, separately or together as circumstances may demand, for the purpose of conference and discussion in regard both to the British-Indian and the All-Indian problems. It will be their earnest hope that by this, means it may subsequently prove possible on these grave issues to submit proposals to Parliament which may command a wide measure of general assent.It is not necessary for me to say how greatly I trust that the action of His Majesty&apos;s Government may evoke response from and enlist the concurrence of all sections of opinion in India, and I believe that all who wish India well, wherever and whoever they are, desire . to break through the webs of mistrust that have lately clogged the relafioSs^between i India -amh Great Britain; His Majesty&apos;s Government have opened the doortolamore: excellent way. I am firmly assured that the course proposed is at once the outcome of a real desire to bring to the body politic of India the touch that carries with it healing and : health, and is the method by which we may best hope to handle these high matters, in the way of constructive statesmanship.
APPENDIX II.Draft letter from Sir J. Simon to the Prime Minister.&apos;.^y    &apos;&quot; Revise. 24th September 1929-.My dear Prime Minister,The Joint Conference of the Statutory Commission and the Indian Central Committee wfiich has been taking evidence in London, supplementary to the testimony and material collected in India, has now finished its sittings, and both wings of the Conference are entering upon the final stage of their work. Before proceeding further, however, the Statutory Commission desires to address you with an enquiry and a suggestion.As our investigation has proceeded, we have become more and more impressed, in considering the direction which the future constitutional development of India is likely to take, with the importance of bearing in mind the relations which may develop between British India and the Indian States. We are not at present in the position to forecast the Report which we&apos; shall hope in due course to present to Parliament. It is, however, already evident to us that, whatever may he the scheme which Parliament will ultimately approve for the future constitution and governance of British India, it is essential that the methods by which the future relationship between these two constituent parts of Greater India may be adjusted, should be fully examined.We have carefully considered the Report of the Butler Committee, but the terms of reference to that body did not cover the whole ground to be surveyed so far as these relations are concerned. Our own recommendations, if we were to exclude from our purview the wider problem which we have indicated, would, we feel, be unduly restricted, and wre therefore wish, before going further, to ascertain whether we should have the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government in giving this possibly extended interpretation to our own terms of reference. It is not our purpose to seek to explore the field already traversed by the Butler Committee, but it seems clear that we cannot afford to ignore the reactions of the presence of the States on the problem we are studying in British India or the possible repercussions on the former of any recommendations we might frame regarding the latter. At certain points an inevitable contact takes place.We venture to point out that if the Report we are preparing and the proposals to be subsequently framed by the Government take this wider-range, it would appear necessary, because of the need for consulting the States, for the Government to revise the scheme of procedure to be followed after these proposals are made known, it seems to us that what would be required would be the setting up of some sort of ^conference after the Reports of the Statutory Commission and the Indian Central &quot;Committee have been made and considered and their work has been completed, and that in this conference His Majesty&apos;s Government would meet both representatives of British India and representatives of the States (not necessarily always together) for the purpose of exchanging views and seeking the greatest possible measure of agreement for the final proposals which it would later be the duty of His MajestyV Government to submit to Parliament. The procedure by Joint Parliamentary Committee conferring with delegations from the Indian Legislature and other bodies, which was previously contemplated, and is referred to in my letter 1o the Viceroy of 6th February 1928, woidd still be appropriate for the examination of the Bill when it is subsequently placed before Parliament, but would, we think, obviously have to be preceded by some such conference as we have indicated.-We realise that it is not for the Statutory Commission to devise this subsequent procedure in detail, for our task will be discharged when we have reported. But we feel that it is desirable to obtain an assurance from His Majesty&apos;s Government that we shall not, in their view, be travelling beyond the terms of reference approved by Parliament if we pursue wdiat seems to us an integral element.in our investigation. We have also thought it right to make plain to His Majesty&apos;s Government the consequence that such an assurance from His Majesty&apos;s Government is likely ultimately to involve, in. order that the future course of procedure may be so shaped as to provide means for consulting with; the.,-Indian States; ;and to promote the: full: co-operation of all parties and interests in the solution of-the Indian problem as -a whole. &apos;     . .v,- -r-^-h 5.&quot; wA^sh Iswi 8     sntopii/o c-ti. fy:[The Indian. Central. Committee asks.to associate itself with the above suggestions, and this letter may therefore be regarded as - coming from both sides of the Joint Conference.]
GDraft letter from Prime Minister to Siv j. Simon.Revise.-24th September 1920. (Initialed by the Prime 2Iinister, 2\5th September.)My dear Simon,Your letter on behalf of the Statutory Commission [with which I understand the Indian Central Committee desires to be associated] raises issues of such importance that f. have thought right before answering it to consult the leaders of other Parties. I have now been able to ascertain their views, and they have been good enough to concur in the terms of my reply.His Majesty&apos;s Government welcome the intimation that your letter affords of the desire entertained by [both] the Statutory Commission [and the Indian Central Committee] to deal in their [respective] report[s] with the wider aspects of the subject to which your letter directs attention. It appears to His Majesty&apos;s Government, as it does to.those on behalf of whom you write, that your work would be necessarily incomplete unless it included a careful examination of the methods by which the future relationship of British India and the Indian States may be adjusted.His Majesty&apos;s Government have given full consideration to what you have said in your letter concerning the consequential necessity of some revision of the later procedure as at present contemplated, and I am glad to be able to inform you that they concur in the view that you have expressed. His Majesty&apos;s Government are, with you, deeply sensible of the importance of thus bringing the whole problem under comprehensive review ; and that under conditions which may promise to secure as great a degree of unanimity as may be practicable. His Majesty&apos;s Government are also greatly concerned to find means by which they may approach the treatment of the broad question of British-Indian constitutional advance in co-operation with all those who can authoritatively speak for British-Indian political opinion. It seems to them that both these objects can. best be achieved by the adoption of procedure that will permit the free interchange of opinion by all concerned, in advance of the stage at which His Majesty-&apos;s Government will lay any proposals before Parliament which may be expected later, as you,point out, to form the subject of examination by a Joint Parliamentary Committee. When, therefore, your Commission have submitted their Report and His Majesty&apos;s&quot; Government have been able, in consultation with the Government of India, to consider these matters in the light of all the material then available, they will propose to invite representatives of different parties and interests in British India and representatives of the Indian States to meet them, separately or together, as circumstances maj- demand, for the purpose of conference and discussion in regard both to the British-Indian and All-Indian problems.It will be their earnest hope that by this means it may subsequently prove-possible on these grave issues to submit definite proposals to Parliament which may-command a wide measure of general assent.With my best wishes for the success of your further labours,I am,Yours very sincerely,kotk.--The retention or omission of the passages in brackets in the above t\yo letters depends on whether Sir J. Simon decides to consult the Indian Central Committee before publication.
APPENDIX III.Selection of Official Reaffirmations of the Declaration of20th August 1917.Extract from Report on Indian Constitutional Eeforms.On 20th August 1917 the Secretary of State for India made the following announcement, in the House of Commons :  &quot;The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, with which the Government of India are iu complete accord, is that of the increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration and the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in India as an intregral part of the British Empire.&quot;June 1919. Mr.. Montagu on Second Reading of Government of India Bill.&quot; That pronouncement (i.e. of 20th August 1917) was made in order to achieve what I believe is the only logical, the only possible, the only acceptable meaning of Empire and Democracy, namely, an opportunity to all nations flying the Imperial Hag to control their own destinies.&quot;February 1921. His Imperial Majesty the King-Emperor&apos;s Message tothe Indian Legislatures.Iror years, it may be for generations, patriotic and loyal Indians have dreamed of Swaraj for their motherland.

Extract from Speech of H.E. the Viceroy at the Inauguration of the Council of State and Legislative Assembly.The conception of the British Government as a benevolent despotism was finally renounced ; and in its place was substituted that of a guiding authority whose role it would be to assist the steps of India, along the road that in the fullness of time would lead to complete self-government within the Empire.May 1921. Extract from Lord Reading*&apos;s reply to the Address presented bythe Simla Municipality.I need not assure you that f assumed my office actuated by the earnest desire that I might be privileged to contribute to the happy and peaceful development of that high destiny which awaits India, if she chooses to avail herself of it as a partner in the British Empire.

Lord 01ivier&apos;s Speech in the House of Lords as Secretaryof State for India.His Majesty&apos;s Government, having themselves the same ultimate aim as the India Swaraj Party, namely, the substitution of responsible Indian Dominion government for the present admittedly transitional political Constitution, are earnestly desirous of availing themselves in whatever may be found the best possible method of this manifest disposition towards effectual consultation.April 1924. Statement made by the Under Secretary of State for India in theHouse of Commons.The object of that (Government of India Act) was gradually to train the peoples of India in the art of self-government so that eventually they might, as I have suggested, take their place alongside the other free nations in the British Commonwealth.May 192&apos;?.
