C.1.1J2J,Pear Mr. Graham,In accordance with the arrangements arrived at, at the last meeting of the miners officials and the Government representatives, on Friday the 25th of October, I shall be expecting on Wednesday evening, October 30th, the proposals of the Government in relation to legislation dealing with Hours, nationalisation of Royalties and regulation of production and prices, which the Government intend placing before the House of Commons during the month of November.When you forward these proposals, I shall be glad if you will send us the date that you intend introducing the legislation - what form reduction of hours will take - and when they will operate.    Also what means the Government intend to adopt, in regard to the stages they propose, in view of the declaration of the Government, that they are reducing hours by stages.You are aware, that we have asked the Government to call both sides - the ooal owners representatives and ourselves together - to discuss and negotiate a national agreement   .  In view of the termination of agreements in the near future, will you kindly let us know what the Government has done on this question ana what is their opinion.In view of the statement made by Mr.  Snowden, acting Premier, that wages must not be reduced in the mining industry, what steps coes the Government interia to take towards that end.I am writing for this information so  that the Miners * Executive shall be fully acquainted with the proposals of the Government and their intentions.    It is very necessary that there will be no misunderstandings between us on these matters.It is quite possible that the miners officials and Executive may desire to meet the Government representatives after they have examined the proposals.    I am, therefore, asking you to make provisional arrangements, if possible, sometime    on Thursday after mid-day, to meet us, if necessary.Yours faithfully,(Sga. )  A.  JoCOOK.Secretary.

While of course it is understood that the members of your Executive Committee will be supplied   with copies of the proposals, 3-ou will appreciate that the document must be treated as strictly confidential until the Government have  announced their coal policy in the House of Commons.As regards tne second paragraph of your letter the Government intend, as sorn as the legislation now under consideration has been disposed of, to proceed with&apos;&quot;  measures\ires for the fux-ther re-organisation of the industry, followed by a further reduction of hours as soon as economic conditions permit,,The answer to the third and fourth paragraphs of 7/uur letter is that one of the objects of the Govern-ment in framing their proposals in respect of the Mining Industry has been to secure, the maximum reduction of hours which in, their opinion the industry can bear without the necessity for a reduction in wages, but that the actual settlement of wages must remian, as at present, a matter for arrangement between the employers&apos;  and workmen,^ S representative ives.The Government have endeavoured to&apos;bring about national, wages negotiations,  and have urged this upon the owners at every opportunity.    They regret that up to the present their efforts have been without success.Yours faithfully,

With regard to Nationalisation of coal royalties, it is proposed to provide for the gradual acquisition by the State of the mineral rights in coal and other minerals necessarily worked with coal.&apos; Under this proposal the State would have the exclusive right in future to grant rights to work coal, and it would also have the right to take over the ownership of coal areas now being worked under existing grants as and when it sees that any practical advantage is likely to enure to the industry.Compensation at market value would be payable to the owners of the property when it is acquired, but no compensation would be payable In the fixture for any&quot; coal which has no market value at the present time. Provision would be made to secure, amongst ether things, that all surface and other rights reasonably required to work and market the coal could be obtained.III..     With regard to the regulation of output and sale, it is proposed to take powers to establish schemed dealing with these matters and to put all collieries under a statutory obligation to conform with the  terms of such schemes.Provision would be made for the establishment of a scheme for each district and also for an inter-district or central scheme to co-ordinate the whole.
04 Qrj L all such schemes would require to ho submitted- to the Board of Trade for approval, and after 1st January, 1930, (or if a scheme for any particular district Is not approved by that date,  after a date to be appointed by the Board of Trade for that district), it would be the duty of tho owner of every cord mine in every district to comply with the provisions of tho inter-district and district schemes-The Board of Trade would be empowered to approve schemes submitted to them or in the alternative themselves to frame a scheme or schemes.More detailed particulars of this measure arc as follows:-Regulation of Output.(a) Regulation of output.(i)      It is proposed that the inter-districtscheme shall make provision for the regulation of output  (for both tho inland and the export trade) as between districts, to be effected in consultation with all the districts, by fixing from time to time tho permitted output of each district.(ii)     Bach district scheme would be required tomake provision for the regulation of putput to be secured by determining a basic tonnage for each pit and by applying to that basic tonnage a quarterly quota (or percentage), calculated to produce from the district as a whole tho output allocated to it under the inter-district scheme.        In every district scheme there would be power to fix varying quotas for different classes of coal and to enable quotas to be increased if necessary before the end of tho period prescribed by the scheme.      Provision would also be made for tho purchase or transfer of quotas.(b) Regulation of price.(i)      It is proposed that any district scheme may include proposals for tho regulation of the price of coal by means of the classification of tho coal produced in tho district and by the determination from time to time of the class into which any coal produced in the district falls and the
til t* vjfminimum price at which, each class of coal may be sold. If price regulation is included in - a scheme,, by resolution of a majority calculated upon output, and the scheme is approved, the observance of the price regulations  would then be Obligatory on all coal owners in the district.(li)       Provision wpUld also be made for the inclusion in theinter-district scheme for devising schemes of ce-ordination of prices and conditions of sale as &quot;between districts on .   application from any district.(c) Po&quot;Ter to grant financial assistance to  the export trade or oTher sections of the coal trade by means of a levy upon output.In the inter-district scheme provision may be made for the grant of financial assistance to the export trade or other sections of the coal trade by means of a levy on output over the whele country.(d) Machinery for reference of matters in dispute to arbitration.(i) In every district scheme there would have to bemachinery approved by the Board of Trade for the appointment ef an independent arbitrator or arbitrators whose decision will be  final.,   to whom colliery owners maV appeal against any decision of a district committee as to the terms and conditions upon which conformity with the principles of approved schemes is required..(il)       A similar provision would be made in the inter-district scheme for appeals by Districts against a decision of the inter-district committee.. &quot;(e) Penalties.Provision would be made in every district scheme and the Inter-district scheme for monetary or other penalties for contravention er failure to comply with any of the provisions of tho schemes.(f) Representation of workpeople and consumers.(I) In each district,  it Is proposed that there should be constituted a committee consisting ofone coal ownerone coal miner and two representatives of consumers with an independent chairman,  to consider the operation of the -scheme and advise the&apos;Board of Trade, from time to time,  of any action taken which in their view is contrary to the best interests of the community,  Including consumers of coal and workpeople engaged In the coal industry. These Committees would be given access to all the relevant information necessary to carry out  their functions.
ft 9 Iiv AIa so far as any recommendations of- these Committees involved an amendment of a district 3cheme as approved and the Board of Trade accepted the recommendation, power would be given for the Board to require such amendment.      If any re-commendation of those Committees necessitated the amendment of any decision arrived at by those administering a district scheme, and they were not prepared to give effect to such amendment of their decision the matter would be referred to .the Independent Arbitrator, whose decision would be final.(ii)    It will also be proposed to constitute a Committee with the same proportionate re-presentation and similar functions in re-gar d to the inter-distriot schemecSize of districts,.The districts for the purpose of the scheme, should, it is proposed, be the wages ascertainment districts,  except where a majority of coal owners in each of two or more wages as-certainmerrt districts approve a scheme covering those districts as one unit.
