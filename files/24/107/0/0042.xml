&apos;   &apos; 145^Translation,--The Czecho-Slovak Republic, London Legation.31st May, 1920.Sir,In the name of the Czecho-Slovak Republic&apos;, which is a Member of the League of $Tationsj I submit to the League, a particularly urgent request :-As you are aware, a serious conflict has arisen between the Czecho-Slovak and the polish Republics on the subject of the Sileu an territory of Teschen,   The supreme Council of the Allies decided last September to hold a Plebiscite in the Silesian Teschen which was to settle to whom this territory should belong.From that moment an -agitation was started in these regions which constitutes a grave menace to the relations between the two States.   At the present time the situation in the silesian Teschen is becoming increasingly grave.   I hare had the honour to lodge a protest with the Paris conference against the many acts of . violence to which citizens of Czech nationality have been sub-jected at the hand of irresponsible Polish elements.   I presented a considerable list of acts of this character, and requested the Paris conference to intervene with the International Teschen Corn-mission.   I am compelled to-day to renew with particular emphasis these protests to the League of Nations.   In the Plebiscite territory houses are being*pilla^ed, burnt and demolished; people are bein^ murdered; attacks with hand grenades are being made, and personal safety no longer exists.   Without wishing in any way to accuse the Government of Warsaw. I must very clearly state the opinion of the czeoho - &quot;Slovak Go rernment on this subject.The czecho - sic 7ak Government as convinced that the poles of the sile&apos;.:ian Teschen are determined at ail costs to prevent the carrying out of the Plebiscite.   After having themselves demanded
it, they realise that they can no longer hope to obtain from it what they ciesired.   The Czecho-Slovak Government was at first opposed to the idea of the   Plebiscite, but when the Supreme Council ordained it, we acquiesced; all we demand now is the ape cay, just and exact execution of the orders of the supreme Council and the carrying out of the plebiscite with the least possible delay. To-day, however, this is becoming more and more illusory.   The poles of the silesian Teschen are endeavouring by every possible means to make the Plebiscite impossibleirinety Polish municipalities have refused to draw up lie at oral li3ts; polish workmen have embarked upon acts of violence against Czech workmen, which, in turn provoke a reprisals by Csech workmen.But, in everybody&apos;s opinion and accordin   to the very definite statement made last week by the president of the Teschen Commission,, the Count de Manneville, to the leader of the Czecho-Slovak Social Democratic party, v. Hemec, the- czecho-31 avaks are infinitely the calmer and&apos;more moderate.As I have already had the honour to inform you, large numbers of workmen of both nationalities are being expelled.   Moreover, the poles are now beginning to expel Silesian agricultural labourers who, though polish-speakin::, are in favour of the union of the Siletian Teschen with Slovakia.   To-day, I have received the news that armed bands* formed by the polish Terrorist organisations are overrunning the silesian Teschen and, with bombs- and hano. grenades, are committing outrages of every description which, so far, remain unpunished.The result of this situation is complete anarchy, which is enabling the anarchist elements to begin&apos;an intensive Bolshevist campaign with purely revolutionary aims.   The Intente troops are quite power less to restore order.   Bein ,; very few in number, they are quite unable to ensure liberty of votin: in some hundreds of communes.
As j have said, anarchy is complete, and each aide accused the other of having prepared and fostered these outrages.In a protest of this kino., it is obviously difficult for me to prove that the responsibilities  ty for these outrages rests with the poles of the fjilesian Tewchen.   But of this the Czecho-Slovak Government is convinced.   ICy object is not to make random accusations; I an only anxious to find means of putting an end to this state of affairs at the earliest possible moment.I must however, point out with deep regret, that, recently the Warsaw Government has taken certain steps to which the attention of the public must be drawn.   A few days ago; in a speech in the v/warsaw Chamber, v. patex, Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs, declared that the Polish Government could not recognise,the result of the Plebiscite if the.czecho-Slovak Government die not put an end to the reign of violence in the Teschen territory.   Moreover, the Chamber discussed a Resolution asking the government to hreax off diplomatic relations with the czecho-slovak Republic.In this connection I must mention certain very regrettable incidents which may have escaped the attention of the League of nations and of the Conference of Ambassadors, but which are nevertheless very characteristic.   I was obliged to protest most emphatically against the words of the chief polish Delegate on the Teschen commission, M. zameyski, who declared in a speech referring to the Teschen territory that a war with the Czecho-Slovak Republic would be most popular in Poland.
moreover the cracow pre a a and.....certain newspapers in T7arsawra.recontinually waging a campaign of intiai-dation against the Czech 31 ova/. Republic; some of them threaten it daily with imr, and declare that, if the territory of Teschen is not obtained by the plebiscite it will be won for Poland by the sword.I consider it very important to draw the attention of the League of $rations to the ;e facts, in order that 1*. may at the sa!..e time formulate precisely the opinion of the Czecho-&apos;]l o vak go ve rament.The Ozecho-Slovak Government has never menaced the Govern-ment of Warsaw either by breaking off diplomatic relations, or by declaring insolf unwillin . to reconi^e the result of the Plebiscite, or by wishing to wage war.   on the contrary, it has a]ways laid stress on its peaceful intentions and its absolutely firm determination to settle the Teschen conflict by pacific means.As the territory of Teschen is at present under the sovereignty of the Allies,  and administered and governed by the International T-schen Commission, the- czecho-Slovak Government has abstained free interfering in any way in the administration of the affairs of Teschen, and has never inter-intervened in, nor helped, either directly or indirectly,any mani-festation or act cf violence.In thus clearly stating the views and actions of the Czecho-Slovak Government, I have tried to make clear to the League of nations that the Czecho-Slovak Government profoundly regrets the levity with which an agitation has been stirred up in a nei hbourin \ state against the Government of our country without any valid reason.   I will add that the Czecho-Slovak Government would not allow for a Gingle moment any newspaper whatever to threaten another Ally with warThe Czecho-Slovak Government feels obli ;ed to protest particularly against this continual ca paign of incitement
&quot;which is endangering not only the peaceful relations he-tween two neighbouring countries, but all central $mope and the situation in Europe generally.An attempt has been made to stir up a campaign with the object o   proving to public opinion and to the Allied Governments that the originators of the acts of violence in the plebiscite territory were the Czechs, if not the..Czec:;o-Slovak Government - certain polish deputies did not hesitate to declare this publicly a few days ago in the Warsaw Chauber. The czecho-Slovak Government has no fear of a strict enjuiry into the origin of the terrorist proceedings in the plebisciteterritory.   For these reasons, I respectfully request the-League of nations to *end a Commission of Enquiry to the terri---tory, in order to denounce vigorously before the people of theworld and before the Allied Governments these: acts of violence,by v/homsoever committed. -I have already had the honour to inform, the Paris Con--ference that I should send this request to the Secretariat of- .the League of Rations.The League of Rations includes among its aims the furthering of friendly relations between the Rations, ana the prevention of all conflicts between them.   The weight of its authority gives it a great role in the future life of the peoples.   I base my request on Article 11 sub-paragraph 3, and the whole of Article 15 of the Covenant of the league of Nations, which are applicable to the case I have had the honour to submit to you in this letter,     I appeal to-aav to the Leaaue of Nations to intervene without loss of time, so as to put an ena to an impossible situation, and to occurrences whioh exercise a demoraiisin.&quot; influence on the t&quot;o nations in conflict, by em-bittering them to so dangerous a decree that the Teschen con-troversy has become a general European danger.   I seek to give a...proof of the goodwill and oeacefui inclinations of the Czecho--iSlovak Government by addressing myself to the League of yation3
while there is yet time, and by requesting its.-intexrejtitionJLn a matter-^ich-.Xsw7iJihi The Czecho-Slovak Government issjady&quot; to supply the secretariat with documentary evidence, and with further information bearing on the conflict in question.I have the honour to remain, &apos; Sir, etc., etc.,(Sgd.)   DR. EDWARD BEEPS,Minister of Foreign Affairs of the czecho-Slovak Republic.
