. 0 A B I N :g ri. .MeffloraMuni by the ff irst 0ornmissioner of 7/orks4I&quot;have road -with some concern the Chancellor^ Memorandum upon the -financial- position of the Housing question. (0*P*1330).The results arising from the scheme whioh has been adoptedof placing on Local Authorities the burden of tho execution of Ho.uaing schemes, while&apos; In reality leaving the financial responsibilitywith the Exchequer, were obviously to be foreseen.   The inducement to Looal Authorities to carry out economical schemes, even if theywers capable of doing so (which most of them ire not^ is veryslight, and, on the other hand, the very high standard of buildingset up by tho Ministry of Health for these Housing schemes makes the financial aspect of the question more formidable than if thehouses had been left to private enterprise^ whioh would have beencontent with a lower standard of achievement.    In addition to theone of financial control, a still more serious aspect is the impossibility under the present system of really making that progress which is required.    This has been reoognised by theGovernment by their offer of subsidies to builders and others.While this undoubtedly may have some effect, I do not feel thatit will really solve the problem which lies in front of us.   Ata very early stage I suggested that the most pressing and immediateshortage of housing requirements should be treated as a national and not a local matter being consequential upon the cessation ofbuilding during the war, and that, only the Government with its resources (as has been shown during the war) could deal adequatelywith the problem, the solution of which to my mind, was to selectthose areas where the housing need was greatest and prooeed immed-iately to erect there a sufficient number of houses to break: the back of the question, &quot;and the rest might be left to the more normal procedure/
procedure existing ?*efore the war of both Municipal and private enterprise.    I have observed in the Memorandum addressed by the Minister of Health to the Cabinet (CP.1396) that he himself has come to this conclusion as he now wishes my Department&apos;to undertake the building of houses on a very considerable scalo.    While natur-ally only too ready to assist and oo-operate with the Ministry of Health in its difficulties in connection with the Housing question, I must confess that it soems to me very unsatisfactory that in this, as in other instances, I am called in only when the position has be-ootaa critioal, merely in an executive capacity, without any power of direction in matters of principle which are also involved.   I origin-ally claimed that my Department was the proper Department to deal with tho whole of the Housing question, as it has a technical staff to deal witl. the building question from a practical point of view, and I think that events have provod that my views were fundamentally sound.There appear to be only two alternatives for dealing with the problem, namely;-(1) To revert to Government control of the building trade, such as was undertaken during the war, with rate-fixing by Conciliation Boards in areas, representation being given to operatives, employers and the Government.(S) The re-organisation of the industry by recognition of the Guild principle.With regard to (1); Government control of the industry would not be accepted by the men to-day, while it is inconceivablo that the Government would control one industry only, leaving all other industries free and uncontrolled.    The Cabinet have already rebooted thi3 alternative and I could certainly not oontemplate asking them to reconsider their decision.- z -
I am, therefore, anxious to impress upon the- Government the absolute necessity of considering my second alternative.To enable the Cabinet to do this it is desirable to show as definitely as possible how the various difficulties which we know of to-day can be overcome.   The following. ; points require agreement on the part of the operatives before much progress can be made :-(a) Agreement in the whole industry on the questionof dilution; the idea being that men should be taken, on as trainees in the trade and&apos; actually given improvers&apos; rates on the work, where it is thought that one trainee to every four men would rapidly get a fair working knowledge of his trade, particularly as regards the character of that work in Housing. (See (5) below) .(b) Agreement to re-introduce the apprenticeship system direct on the work., where it is thought that one apprentice to every four men would be efficiently absorbed.(c) Agreement to overtime at reasonable rates when required.(d) Agreement to a longer Summer Time working hours, which would always in such a trade as the building trade be in excess.of Winter Time hours (See (l) below).(e) Agreement to any suggested methods for the increase of output by bounties on an agreed basis of special payment for all work above a fair agreed daily average.(f) Agreement to abolish all stoppages and disputes; settlement of vexed questions to be referred to Boards, upon which the Guild would have large representation.(g) Agreement to a measure of trade control of labour
by-the &quot;Guildv ..T^.s&apos;^rad0-oojatrol of. labour to extend to all works other than housinp and works of national. jjnpoTtance; the aim being to make the Guild exercise the control over luxury and less important building in consultation with the Government. Such a scheme would save the undesirable effect of -local influence when luxury building is controlled through the, Local Authorities; and would also save the criticism which might be addressed to a rational control of luxury building without -the intervention of the Guild.It is unlikely that labour would agree to- any of these demands without the general agreement of the Government to some of their principal demands.   These may be summarised as follows(1)    To abolish the seasonal character of the building trade and to grant a guaranteed minimum week on all building work.-   At present men in this trade lose much time in the winter months which they cannot possibly make up in the summer months; they should &quot;have a guarantee that throughout the year they would receive a weekly living wage. (See. (d) above)..(2)   To grant trade control through the Guild of its own labour in common with the control of the central authority in charge.of the work, which should, of course, he Government control.(3)   Grant the Guild idea in connection with the organisa- -tion of the building industry for all the trades in that Indus ory and acknowledge the Guild as contracting party in any arrangement which it might be thought desirable to make for building.(4)   Give the Guild powers,, in consultation with the Govern-ment to stop all work in the building trade other than work such as housing and work of national impor tance and of high importance to industry and trade generally.-4-
(5)     Give the Guild or the component Unions ran under-taking that their funds should be relieved of any liability for the unemployment pay of diluted labour.   The fear of anemploy* ment is the main cause of the objections of the building tradesmen to dilution^ and as the Government are pressing them -to yield on the point they must ^nr-return assj. me the liability f cr dm employment pay.   This could be done either by making an actuarially calculated contribution to the funds of the Guild cr Union in respect of each dilutee, or by direct payment by the Government to the dilutee over a stipulated number of years,    (See (a) above.)In order to surmount the formidable difficulties, a very [bold policy would appear necessary^ involving the organisation of the building industry for housing on National Guild lines, the Contractor to be eliminated - and he has really eliminated1 himself0 Some strong organising force is required to direct the oadriinistra-participator. of these works.   The labour side of the industry is not sufficiently advanced to be able to undertake successfully the organisation of larg^building schenies-, nor have they the necessary financial machinery.   r!hat seems to me a practicable proposition is that my Department, which has had considerable experience in direct administration work, should take the place of the Contractor the Guild taking its share in the Organisation of the laboir forces under the supervision of, and in co-operation with, the officers of my Department.   This scheme, if successfully dealt with.,&apos; as I think it could be, as far as Government work is concerned, would then become more generally aob pted throughout the country *My Department has already an important scheme in operation for the Oamberwell Borough Council   which is being run successfully on these lines and on which I attach a report made by Sir Prank Baines, the Director of Works, who conceived and organised the idea which I think-5-
H.M. OFFICE- OF &apos;&quot;OhKSj S.r;.14th June, 1.920.think of very great value,- and which has encouraged me to put forward recommendations which might, on the face of it, appear too idealistic for practical application.I feel that I must add one word, of warnings   Labour1 is naturally syspicioiis,.. especially of formal Government pro-posals, and the greatest tact and. discretion will be needed in approaching the interested parties.   My view is- that if the Cabinet approve my suggestion in principle they should give me authority to depute experienced and capable officers to open up negotiations onthe lines above indicated,(Sgd)   ALFRED mm.
O-itKSai/ELL HOUSING SOME.    * ORGANISATION BY DDggj ADMINISTRATION IN CONJUNCTION v/ITH THE LIB OUR AND TRADES COUHOIL,fffonort by Sir Prank Bainos). 1 &apos;First 0 commision si oner,..The Camborwell Borough Council originally was considered most retrogressive in pushing forward with its Housing Programme, but when the present Labour Council came into power an effort was made to get them to recognise thoir responsibilities and proceed with all speed with their scheme.As a result, I was asked to meet the Council, who had agreed in principle that we should carry out their scheme for them, the Council urging that the whole of the labour feeling in the Borough demanded tho elimination of Contractors and the institution of direct labour in building.I therefore hold a Conference between the &apos; representatives of the Labour and Trades Council at iiri-ibcr-n well, and tho Housing.Commit bee of the CamberwolL Borough Council,, the members of which were all labour representatives and agreed a general basis for proceeding with the works1st.     It was agreed to obtain all the labour required through the Labour and Trades Council of Camberwell, it being stipulated that the Council must meet our requirements as made known to them and supply labour in the proper categories and of the rr^rht quality,.At the beginning of the negotiations considerablesuspicion/
M Vf ysuspicion ox Government&apos; control was evinced, but I am happy to say that it is now entirely dissipated.Certain o^cossivo demands wore presented by the Labour- and Trades Council, namely a guaranteed week, travelling time lor.labour brought from a distance, railway faros for labour brought from a distance, and other similar unreasonable claims,   I was able to convince&apos;&quot;the Labour and IPriidce Council that ro could not grant those demands at the moment; that they acre ilationml questions and implied a necessity of a national settlement with regard to them.  . ri&apos;he Council therefore gavo way to my re pro sent at ions, and have not starved tho jobs in Labour as a consequence; although it was represented to no that the difficulties in mooting my requirements in such circumstances were grave.&quot;J        The Council further asked for full details of the nature of our supervision, and expressed, suspicion as to its costi    V/hen I stated that I could give a definite guarantee that tho total cost of supervision would be less than 5 per cent, they expressed themselves as fully satisfied, and further I gave them an undertaking to keep all supervision charges separately, and to give them a return of tho final cost.   I am quite assured that wo shall keep the total below 5 per cent,,The Labour and Trades Council then asked for tho power to approve the appointments of Clerks ox Worksf. etc I explained that I could not grant this, and illustrated that tho nature of tne duties of Clerks of Works was to supervise the erection of tho scheme from the point of view of tho Architect, and to sec that his design and specification woro properly carried out..  This I pointed out, was primarily the concern of tho architect, and I was assured that our experience was greater then theirs on such work.   lrhey admitted my arguments and gavo way on this point.They insisted, however, that Foremen should beappointed/
appointed, with their concurrence.    To this I agreed, and formed A Se:eotion Committee of two representatives of the Labour and Trades Council, one Architect of this Department, and thisDepartments Labour Officer,    The General foremen wore all appointed by this Committee and our best nominees were accepted by them without question.    We also wore able to accept some of the Labour and Trades Council!s nominees .as we. regarded thorn as entirely satisfactory.   The appointments na o have proved excellent,.-further they demanded that all leading hands should be appointed by the foreman.    I agreed to this, as I considered it a proper arrangement *We have thus got the whole of the supervisory labour on . the site agreed with the Labour and Trades Councils    As a net result, the labour control has been completely satisfactory from the start, the number of workmen has steadily increased from approximately 50 on May 1st to 460 on June 9th% no disputes or stoppages have occurredrandevery complaint of the men has-been met and answered immediately, and without friction.The Labour and Trades Council asked for agreement to the principlo ofa VJorks Committeo for the men.    To this I agreod on condition that tho Works Committee acknowledged tho control of tho Trades Unions, and acted through tho Labour and Trades Council.   This has boon done and has proved entirely satisfactory.Generally the output of the labour on the site is better than on any contract Job, and the general description of the Jobs on the part of tho workmen is that they arc &quot;sweet&quot;.    Ac a not &apos; result, tho jobs havo got a good reputation among Trades Unionists and labour in coming forward satisfactorily and is working well.The Labour and Trades Council agreed generally in principlo that they woro not qualified, nor had they the requisite oxperienco to run tho job, -purchaco the material, -and control tho whole cite.. V/c aro therefore agreeing each step and acting with thorn, and controlling/
&apos;   208i jcontrolling and organising tlio work in consultation with thornbut purch:xing all tho material directly oursolver.Representations wore m;:,do that wo should make tho joinery from Timber supplied directly ourselves,, owing to the fact that joinery obtained through contractors was unsatisfactory and bad in quality;     I thoroforo prevailed upon the Labour representatives of tho Borough Council to grant&apos; mo facilities iriythoir own shops for making tho joinery for tho Housing Schemes by direct labour..    Those facilities have boon granted at the most reasonable charge of 8-J$ which charge includes tho use of machinery, power, light and buildings, etc.    Tho joinery work is being done by direct employment, tho Joinery, $orcmon, and loading hands being appointed in agreement with the Cambcrwoll Labour   nd Trades Council,, and has been done to a very high standard at very reasonable cost,One peculiar feature of tho job is that practically no labour has left the- site after its first engagement.   In my experience this is quite unusual.   So serious has been theinstability of building labour on contract work, both during the War and since the Armistice, that on certain contractors jobs tho number of men leaving the site during the progress of tho work has boon equivalent to a complete change of the labour on the job every 8 weeks0   This moans serious disorganisation, which at Camberwcll is entirely eliminated,Throo weeks after tho commencement of the job I pressed tho Labour and Trades Council to give way on the principle of allowing tho dilution of tho skilled trades by the employment or Trainees and improvers.   After some discussion they have agreed to this principle, and. I am now increasing the number Ctf men by placing trainees and improvers on the work in the skilled trades to tho extent of 1 in 7.     Tho Unions are, I tlunla, prepared to give way oven further when they arc in a position %qsee/
sec- how the dilution wgrka.Generally the spirit of the whole of the negotiations with the Labour and Trades Council has been admirable.    They now TulJT*t^U5t-the Department and shew no suspicion in dealing with us.The work has, of course, entailed a good deal of labour in keeping in personal touch witlr the Labour representatives but the results have been so admirable as fully to warrant the time spent upon this.&apos;I am now pressing the Labour and Trades Council to agree to the principle of apprenticeship and I am assured that they would agree to this providing this Department could guarantee a form of Article by which apprentices could be bound to the Department for a period of 5 years.    All that the Labour and Trades Council stand out against in this particular is the appointment of apprentices who cannot obtain their full $raining for a satisfactory period.Generally the job is in extraordinarily &quot;good heart&quot;, the increase in numbers of both skilled and unskilled trades is steady and effective, no wastage of labour through dismissal, dispute or dissatisfaction has occurred, and the output is decidedly better than that on any contract job.&apos;I attach for your information the notice which has been issued to the Trades Unionists working on this scheme by the Camberwell Trades Council.     This notice shows the admirable spirit which has been displayed by the labour Representatives   . dealing with the work, and which is having excellent results with the men.(Sd.) FRAME BAIKES9.6.20*
TO TRADBTTJUrONISTS IN THE- BUILDING INDUSTRYTeOlow^orkere,&apos;Labour Is fit to govern and to participate in the direction of Industry.    Labour has fought for ideals, for co-operation and the reconstruction of the&apos; social order.&apos; labour is opposed to the middleman, tho profiteer, the private contractor.    It believes In doing things for itself. The Camberwell Borough Council Scheme is now approved by the Ministry of Health.    The Scheme will be carried through by the Office of Works in conjunction with the Camberwell Trades Council.    A   Committee   of the Trade Unions in the Building &quot;Trades has been set up to carry the scheme through. In consultation with the Office of Works it has appointed tb* General Foremen; the stewards will be responsible to their Union represented on/the Committee; the Committee will deal with all complaints;. Labour will.be supplied through the....Committee and 1&apos;rades Council; only Unionists will therefore be&quot;employed and Union rates will prevail.,   trade the Trades Council and Building/Unions appeal to your craft traditions, your best instincts, your public spirit^ your1 Labour idealism.    &quot;e want your loyal co-operation In-the work.    \7e want to   show what Trade Unionists can do.    We want to show that a   Garden City Scheme can bp built in record time/ at economic rates, with the utmost efficiency, best workmanship and execution,&apos; by Direct Labour and/Trade Union Co-operation.    The success of this will mark a historic milestone&apos; In the history of labour. It will be the death-knell of the&apos;contractor, it will keep rents down, it will prove the turning point in building schemes in this country.We appeal as Labour men, to you an Citizens and Trade Unionists.     Give us -of your Labour and Co-operation
If you are prepared to work on tho Scheme, give your name to your local Branch Secretary.(Signed)   A. C, WARWICK, Chairman. , it Signed)   A. CREECH JOKES, Secretary&apos;.Camhorwell Trades Council.16 Peckham Road, S.E.
