SKIS DOCUMBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRXTAMIC MAJESTY&apos;3 .RET.THE TRjJglflg AID RBSETTLmMT OP EX-SERVICE MEN. &apos; &apos;.1493.        &quot; &quot; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;       * *       &apos;MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OP LABOUR.I have now completed three months in my present office, and  &quot;daring that time have devoted myself very closely to the case of the ex-Servioe man.   I should like to submit to my colleagues a statement of the situation.(1) TRAlglgg FOR DISABLED MM.(a) We have trained 11,469 men under the Ministry of Labour since August last, in addition to about 11,000 who had been trained under the Ministry of Pensions, making a total of rather over 22,000.(b) We have now in training 23,821 men.(c) There are still on the &quot;Waiting&quot; list 23,721 men. As regards (c), progress is-painfully slow.   Theacquisition and adaptation of premises;   the supply of equipment and tools:   and the discussion with National and Local Technical Advisory Committees as to how many &quot;trainees&quot; &quot; can be admitted to this or that craft with their approval -all make for delay.   But these proceedings are now being speeded up, and I am not entirely dissatisfied with results * to date,   then the adaptation and equipment of the existing training centres has been completed, further places will &apos;be provided for the following approximate numbers of trainees:-Building 3,500Basket Making 70Watch and Clock 300Sheet Metal 93 Mechanical and electrical Engineering 2,205Pattern Makers 125Furniture taking 1,900Tailoring 580Vehicle Building 1,300.10,073.I hope that very shortly we shall be turning out
1   34between 400 and 500 men a week, and in these circumstances the absorptive capacity of the various trades la a matter requiring the most careful attention.In the meantime the length of time that disabled men are on the &quot;Waiting1&apos; List for training, some as much ,aa 18 months or more, is a source of grave irritation amongstAnother source of irritation which 1 find very well marked, not only in my relations with these organisations, but in the oeuree of personal visits which I have paid to various training centres, is the inadequacy 6f the training allowance.   The basic allowance for a single man in training is the same m the maximum disability pension, viz. 40/- p^r week. When the num. of 40/- was fixed, the &quot;cost of living&apos;&quot;&apos; figure stood at 115*   It is now. at 160*   The ex-Service man constantly draw attention to those facts, and, furthers to the numerous bonuses and increases of wages awarded from time to time to workmen la industries generally, to meet, and la some oases to more than meet, the increased cost of living.   In conjunction with the Minister of pensions X am putting forward proposals for a bonus tc meet this position.Beyond this there ara certain respects in which the existing scale of allowances la constantly stated to be unjust.    I shall be hound to preea for a more generous dispensation of the &quot;Dependant SeXativesff allowance, and for its extension to aingle men in such a way as to place. the single man with a widowed mother whether he is living at home, or away, in substantially the same position m the married man with the eame obli^ationjay some very   hard   oases    have    been    brought    to    my  notice
where trainees have to keep themselves, a widowed mother, and one or two brothers and sisters on the 40/- a week.rThis is a serious problem, and, again, is creating great bitterness of spirit in ex-Service circles.   We have now 24 j ECO disabled men drawing the Unemployment Donation. Their chance lies in the King&apos;a Soil.   At present 17,389 firms are on the King1s Boll, end they are employing 145,536 disabled men.   The^jiumber of firms on thelying&apos;s Roll ought easily to be doubled and tho men in this tragic category provided for.      To do- this a brief but well-backed and well-directed campaign should be all that is necessary.   At present the Municipal Authorities are not doing very well; neither are tho Railway Companies;   and the results so far as private employers are concerned show considerable variations as between one place and another.   In order to get these important gaps filled up, I am convinced that a strong lead is necessary.   Local authorities should certainly be on the Holly and in my opinion all newspapers should bear the King1s Seal.   I have just received from the Chancellor of the Exchequer a letter stating that he is ready to agree that the name of the Treasury on behalf of Government Departments generally shall at once he placed on the roll.   This will be of enormous assistance to me.   It is true that the Chancellor stipulates that it shall be clearly understood and recorded in my Department that the Government reserves full liberty to reconsider its position, if and when circumstances necessitate such a course,   But this, of course, is the position also  ,of a private employer.   If X can get
other things for whioh I am pressing. I think the Cabinet may feel easy about the question of the disabled men unemployed   With proper support, I believe that problem can, substantially, be solved.f3&apos; IM&apos;S3EU?TED APPRENTICESHIPS.Schemes for rendering State assistance for^s^epvioe^ apprentices,,have- bean. $rexared&apos;&quot;hy organisations r^^re-eaiitative of employers and trade unions in 39 industries, including, about 800 different trades.   Over 37,000 apprentices have been brought under these Schemes;-   about 31,000 are now in receipt of assistance and some 6,000 have completed their training.These Schemes have set the standard of conditions for ex-Service apprentices in. those establishments -$here State assistance is not desired.   A considerable section of private employers, the majority of the Railways and the various Government Factories come into this class.   It is probable that nearly as many apprentices are employed in these establishments as in those where State assistance is being paid.It has not, up to the present, been found possible to secure the absorption of all the ex-Service apprentices. There are between 3,000i and 4,000 who still remain to be dealt with.   Exact figures are now being collected.   About . half the persons concerned belong to the Engineering Industry, which is still suffering from a shortage of materials consequent on the Moulders7 Strike.The Department have throughout received full co-operation from the associations of employers and trade unionists who prepared the Schemes.
This is a very serious problem indeee., and I wish to warn my colleagues that bad trouble may arise any day. There are now about 167,000 fit ex-Service men drawing the Unemployment Donation - many, of course, with wives and families, drawing 2-0/-. a wee.k (the actual number unemployed is certainly higher than this).   In the great centres, naturally enough, these men are a storm centre of grave discontent.   I give the numbers in the 35 centres where unemployed ex-Service men are most numerous.

As at present arranged the Unemployment Dentition ceases on July 5.1st - except where m^u having been more recently demobilised, may have outstanding rights under the existing regulations,, .Most of these Msg(0G0 fit. ex-Service men now receiving unemployment donation are unskilled,, and unless either the problem is tackled as that of &quot;dilution&apos;&quot; was in March 1915, or these men are entered for &quot;training&quot;, the difficulties which confront us will not be reduced to any considerable extent.Here, of course, the attitude of organised labour, is a most important factor.   With regard to fit men 1 am advised that few of the skilled Trade Unions have done anything except to secure the re-employment- of their own members *   With regard to the training and employment ofdisabled men, most Trade Union leaders and many Trade Unions have been, and are, helpful, but a number of local Branches and members have not been helpfulc   They are afraid of luiemploynient, and in some cases they are unduly apprehensive on this0This situation needs the most careful examination, and I have taken as a basis of consideration tfte facts summarised in &quot;the following table,,   The table compares . what has been, or is being done in the training of disabled men (columns A, b and c) with, for each Industry, the number registered as unemployed during the week ended May 28th (column D) and the vacancies notified and unfilled
at tho end of the same week (column E); finally, correct-ing the bare figure result with the expert knowledge of my labour advisers, 1 have said (in column P) whether there appears to be room for further training or absorption,.It has, of course, to bo remembered that the Exchange figures do not give the total number of vacancies unfilled, nor, though the difference is less marked here, the total number of unemployed.   They are, however, a ;:ood index of the general situation.

The outstanding; feature&apos; of the above list is the opening in the Building Industry, and for that Industry,, I have consequently given the detailed figures in each trade,.   My own view is that if the bricklayers1 labourers were placed on the simpler forms of bricklaying, and their places were filled by unskilled labourers, opportunities would be provided for the absorption of a large number of fit ex-service men as builders&apos; labourers.   This proposition, I think, should be put to the trade, and I have called the attention of my colleagues (CP. 1485) to a recommendation by the Committee on the Re-Employment of Ex-Service Men, which appears to provide a very favourable opportunity for the Government to again approach . the Industry.Here and elsewhere, it appears to me that it ought to be possible to fix up something corresponding to the Treasury agreement of the 17th, 18th and 19th March, 1915.On another&quot; Paper (CP. 1315) I am asking the Cabinet to decide whether we shall not now push on wherever possible with the training of fit ex-service men.   The particular ease raised there is a very small one, but, if the principle is approved,I anticipate that in many cases it will be,possible to arrange for ohto training of fit men in employers1 workshops, under conditions which, having regard to the present large number of ex-Service men unemployed, I cannot but regard as in the interests of true economy.I sub-join a table which will no doubt interest my colleagues as further evidence on the question of the employment of fit ex-S-ervice men - either with or without training.The Exchange figures indicate clearly a continuous shortage of labour in staple trades.

(5)   OTICERS^I turn now to the officers, and men of similar educational-qualifications, who are the responsibility of our Appointments    i Department-.   213,094 officers have been demobilised, but no corresponding figure for other ranks as defined above is available-   Posts have been found by the Appointments Department for 33,737 and a further 46,564 have been trained, or are in training under the Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme for the Higher Education and Training for those who have served in the Forces, which is administered by the&apos; Appointments \/*        .   a department, and the respective Educational and Agricultural Departments for England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland * (The bulk of this figure are in trainings   When that js- completed theiquestion of employment will become^aoute ^so far asjfchese officers and men are concerned.) 4,451 are waiting training.13,263 are registered with the Appointments Department as unemployed.   (The total number of ex-service men of these classes who are unemployed is no doubt very much larger.)The preliminary work on applications under the Training Scheme is nearing completion and all applications will have been dealt with by the end of August.On the employment sido the efforts of the AppointmentsDepartment have been increasingly successful.   The weeklyaverage of candidates placed in employment has steadily risen! butindications are..-not lacking that a difficult time-, is ahead.The 13,263 candidates remaining on the books as unemployedrepresent, by reason of their lack of qualifications andprevious experience, a residuum regarding which i feel a grave concern, particularly as the existing avenues of employmenthave been thoroughly explored, amd success in the future mustto a large exnent&apos;deoend on the exixuision of industry.-14-   .
In its work the Appointments- Department has had the sympathy and assistance of many outside organisations, andhas in fact established a comprehensive voluntary agency in its Interviewing Boards and Appointments Panels comprised. * iof over 2,200 professional and business men.   These Jpoards have&apos; performed work of the utmost value during the past 16 months, but I fear that there will be an increasing difficulty in keeping them together*In the light of this Important factor, and of others, I have recently made a ^a^ful survey of the future of professional employment and considered amongst other points the suggestion that the employment side of the Appointments Department, work might be made over io Lord Haig*s Officers1 Association^   This suggestion 1 tras unable for various reasons to accept,^ but Lord Haig*s Association can help us in various directions, particularly at this time in strengthening the voluntary agency of the Department, and I have arranged to meet the Association in order to discuss with them plans-iof co-operations(6)   TEE EX-SERVICE MI IN IRELAND.There has been experienced over since the armistice considerable difficulty in finding employment for ex-Cervioe men in Ireland *   Although every effort is made by the Exchanges to place these men in touch with suitable vacancies, and they receive, so far as the Exchanges are concerned, preference over civilian applicants for any work which, may be available and equally suitable, only 10,557 Ex-service men had been placed by the Irish Exchanges between the armistice and the 7th May 1920.   The total number placed during the four weeks ended 7th May, 1920., was 496, and the total number on the registers of the Employment Exchanges in Ireland as requiring employment on the 7th May 1920, was 20,873.   The number of men discharged or demobilised exceeds 100,000.-15- The/
The special difficulties which attach to the work of finding employment for ex-service men in Ireland are as followsj-(a) Before the war some 30,000 people emigratedevery year.   During the war emigration was &apos;prohibited with the result that, at the conclusion of hostilities, there wase large numbers of applicants for employment who, under normal conditions, might have been absorbed by emigration.(b) Large numbers of civilians who had taken tho placeof the men who had enlisted became members of Trade Unions *   During recent years there has been a considerable growth in Trade Union organisa-tion in Ireland*   If those civilians who have taken the place of soldiers during the war were displaced, serious labour trouble would be anticipated, which few employers are prepared to face.(c) There is political antagonism to the employment of ex-soldiers especially in the South and West. Local Authorities and employers holding public positions are afraid to run counter to this feeling. -(d)   The state of the country prohibits new enterprise and trade is irregular and constantly subject toi- disturbance through political troubles. (e)   There is considerable unemployment even among civilians.The/
The main hope lies in the provision of fresh openings for employment.   I have already been in communication ,wlth certain of my colleagues with a view to putting in hand various forms of public works, and 1 am considering what other steps can be taken.As regards Training also, the position is far from satisfactory.   The number-of men in industrial training on 1st Kay was 1,508, of whom 1,184 &quot;/ere disabled.; 55 men completed a discontinued training during the preceding month, and 2,430 were a^Riting training on 1st Kay.   The main difficulty has been to get accommodation.   Sanction has recently been received to acquire an aerodrome and a camp for use as training centres, but the military have now found it necessary to resume possession Of the aerodrome,   A good deal of trade union opposition is being experienced in certain trades.As regards the Higher Training Scheme, on 11th June 199 officers and 260 other ranks were in training, 77 officers and 99 other ranks had completed training, and 50 officers and&apos;32 other ranks had had grants sanctioned and were awaiting trainings(Signed)   T.J.MACJ?AHARA,Ministry of Labour, 19,6.20,
