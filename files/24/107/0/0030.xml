uwm itIflLThis Document is the Property of^7EPORT OP THE DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON WHOLESALE . POOD MARKERS*Waste of Fisho the Pood Controller.In accordance with your instructions, we have investigated he waste, of fish and the causes underlying such waste, and have leasure.in submitting our report on this question.1. ActualCondemnations,2, Condemnations at Ports.3, Condemnations . .at Billingsgate,ITables are attached showing:-(a) Tonnage of Pish landed at the principal Fishing Ports, and Tonnage and percentage of Fish Condemned for the period 1st January -30th April, 1920.(b) Similar statistics applicable to Billingsgate Fish Market for the years 1913, 1918, 1919 and 1st January - 30 April 1920.Figures have not been obtained of the waste at the 12 principal ports (other than Billingsgate) previous to. 1st January 1920* For the period from this date to the 30th April 1920,, however, the percentage is only, .33, representing 6,31 tons as compared with a percentage of 1.16 representing 966 tons at Billingsgate for the same period.It will be seen from Table C attached that&apos; the percentage of fish condemned at Billingsgate.shows a considerable increase In 1918.and a further increase In 1919 as corn-pared with ;1913.   .This increase, is also apparent In a comparison of the returns for the first \f.our months:of each of these years. In this period of 1920, the percentage of condemnations fras&quot;declined from 1*202 in -1919 to 1.16 on a much larger tonnage handled.In considering the Billingsgate figures
it is important to bear in mind tht relation- -ship of thb watbr-bornb to thb rail-borne fish.   For the period of 1920 under review,., condemnations of water-borne fish amounted to 10 tons &amp; &quot;20 per oent on a total landing of 4794 tons as compared with 056 tonp - 1*22 per cbnt on a total dbllvtry of 77,899 tonsfl On tht. othbr hand tho condemnations of waters home fish in 1913 were lrlB per cent aw compared with c&apos;33 for land-borne only.Figures art? not available for loss occasionally oourring in the case of exoep-tional landings at small ports (b,gt pilchards maokerbl, sprats eto0);which have no regular provision of railway transport; and sometimes no market at which inland buyers are repre-sented t(a) Ports of Lap dip/;.   The; principal r basons given for condemnation at thb ports are thb following :**- Landings of immature fish too email to be marketable and not suitable for curing*   At Flbbtwood, in April last,large quantities of small or immaturb fish of low grade failed to find a salb owing to plentiful supplibe of better qualityb   The Fish distribution Officer selbottd 3 tons of the best of 1his fish and sent it to Prbston for salb in the poorer quartbrs of the town*   Supplies hbre were also go plentiful that this fish could hardly be sold at nominal prices and as a matter of fact the whole consignment only rballsbd  3. 10,0. which would not cover costs, t- Landings of rough fish not markbtable as foodo(Note j- It has always been jshb custom for
these classes of fish to bb utilised as * i manure.)- Landings of fish in bad condition, a considerable proportion of whioh is Danish, Norwegian or Iceland fish caught by boats at sea for long periods,Ko evidence has been given to the effect that fish is often wasted at. the principal ports owing to absolute lack of transport.   A recent case occurred at Milford Haven where heavy landings synchronised&apos; with a railway aocldent with the result that fish arrived too late for market, buyers const-quently wired to withold supplies on the following day and the congestion thus brought about caused the loss of about 100 tons of fish,(b) Transport by Rail. A reference to Table C will show that the condemnations at Billingsgate in 1918 and 1919 of fish, which during th ese years was almost entirely rail-borne, rose to more than five times in e percentage of rail-borne condemnations in  . 1913Q   This certainly suggests that the  -increase was due mainly to new deficiencies of railway transport caused by the war, the difficulties of Billingsgate Market being a factor present in each of the years compared.These railway deficiencies have not yet been remediedo   Evidence of traders Is unanimous as to the serious effect of fre-quent delays in forwarding fish by rail. Retailers must make their purchases in time for a morning trade and if consignments of fish do not reach the market early, there is difficulty in disposing of them, the stocks
- 4-are held over till the following day and. de-Wr^ ioration and waste must occur.It is stated by witnesses that undue delay on rail is caused, in the cross-country traffio, at the Junctions.Aberdeen supplies are brought to  Southern markets by the slower Midland route instead of by the East or IVtst Coast houtes, thus entailing later delivery at the markets.There is a serious deficiency of properlyconstructed wagons such as are suitable forthe conservation of the fish and the conveyance of it by -Spast trains.   The high percentage ofcondemnations ,shown by Table C for the summer months indicates the great urgency of this need,5, Deliveries to Railway representative attribute much ofBillingsgatetthe delay in marketing fish to the difficulty in bffbofclng delivery at thb market owing to thb &apos; congestion of its approaches.   Tht avbra^ dbl&amp;y4&apos; is admitted to be      hours which appears to the Committee to be altogether bxeessive.   Thb practice of holding up railway vans until their contents are sold adds greatly to the difficult t/ibe of the situation but appears to be intvit-able under present conditions.   Loads of fish unsold, in such circumstances are taken back to the railway or carrier&apos;a yard until next day, sometimes without being re-iced, and waste occurs in oonoe-quencfc.   This condition existed at Billingsgate before the war on an average daily supply of 500 - 600 tons, of which nearly 40$ Were water-bornt.   The dailj? average for April last was 881 tons.&apos; of which only about 7fo were water-born^.
The Committee is informed that London condemnations (in the case of wholesale supplies) take place only at Billingsgate and that Pish at a railway or other depot found to he unfit for human food cannot be there condemned but must be brought to the market precincts for the purpose; thus adding to the congestion of traffic,A considerable proportion of the   fish condemned consists of arrivals too late for the Saturday morninr market, which must then be held over until Monday; consignees (selling on commission) often refusing to accept delivery when first tendered 0Billingsgate does not at present possess ice plant or suitable storage for carrying over surplus quantities of fiahj but it is understood that such is now being provided *The Committee is investigating the question of the provision of oold stores in the ordinary sense of the word,   It is important that, if a freezing process be adopted; Wwrt1 the. fish should be subjected to it as soon as possible after being caught. For this reason; oold storage-should be established at ports of landings In addition? Inland markets should be provided with such ice plant and storage as is necessary to supply temporary accommodation0   Much is expected from the hew brine-freezing process which is now being   introduoed into this country.,&apos;It must be pointed out,, however, that such palliatives as the provision of oold stores can hardly do nructy to improve the situation   The essential remedies will be found In the provision, of suitable rolling-
