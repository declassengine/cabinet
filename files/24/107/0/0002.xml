Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.   y^BIlT^CP. 1402    Y; 3SECRET.I circulate the annexed Memorandum to iiiv colleagues &quot;in compliance with the Prime Ministers request. I. regard the proposals wade therein as developments of the suggestions which I placed before the War Cabinet in November 1917 and in subsequent memoranda. The area with which we have to deal is much larger than the responsibilities I had in contemplation 2\ years ago, and I have had to modify or bring up to date suggestions that I made then. Perhaps, however unusual in forwarding for consideration such a document, and in recommending the trans-ference to another Department of administrative work hitherto discharged by my Office, I may be allowed to express my admiration of the work which has been done in Mesopotamia, and my appreciation of the ready acceptance and efficient discharge of new responsibilities by the officials in my Department. I would also add that 1 recognise, even more fully than in 1017, the services rendered to the Government by Lord Curzon&apos;s presidency of the Eastern Committee and its successors. Any proposals that I have made, in conformity with the principles that I think ought to govern the distribution of functions between Government Departments, for transference of work from the Foreign Office to a new Department, are to me the more acceptable, because if the scheme which I have suggested for a Standing Cabinet Committee is accepted, Lord Curzon&apos;s great qualities will still he-available in discussing the problems of an area to which he has devoted so much time and of which he has acquired such knowledge.E. S. M..   2nd dune 1920.Mesopotamia and Middle East: Question of future Control.(Memorandum by Secretary of State for India.)1. The war lias brought us into special relationship with various areas in the Middle East formerly included in the Ottoman Empire. The character of this relationship varies in the different areas. It is closest in Mesopotamia and Palestine, for which we have accepted a &quot; mandate&quot; ; less close in the Arabian peninsula (excluding the Hejaz), where we merely enjoy a &apos;&apos; predominant influence &quot; ; loosest of all in the Hejaz, which has been recognised as an &quot;independent &quot; State. But all these varieties have one feature in common : they all differ from anything that existed before the war. Even in the mandated territories, our position falls far short of) sovereignty or even suzerainty, and our duties will, it is hoped, be transitory and diminishing. It does not amount to a &quot; protectorate &quot; as hitliertg understood. On the other hand, it differs entirely even in the &quot;independent&quot; llejaz from the ordinary diplomatic connection between nations of equal status. The novelty of this relationship is the measure of the need for some new controlling agency at head-quarters. The India Office and the Colonial Office are accustomed to administer and to &quot; protect&quot; ; diplomacy inter pares is the business of the Foreign Office. No Depart-ment of His Majesty&apos;s Government has hitherto conducted (at any rate on any considerable scale) the delicate relations which circumstances have now imposed upon us.2. It has always appeared to the India Office that the proper solution of the difficulty lies in the creation of a new Department (the &quot; Middle East Office&quot; might be a suitable designation) to control our relations with all the areas in the Middle East with which we have now been brought into direct contact. These would comprise Mesopotamia, the Persian Gulf, the whole Arabian peninsula (including the Gulf littoral, Oman, the Aden Hinterland and the Hejaz). Palestine, Syria (in so far as concerns British interests in that area), Armenia and Kurdistan. Egypt and the Sudan would naturally pass under the control of the same Department. Probably also Persia, with whom the agreement, of 1919 has brought us into a new relationship 10 1628     120 6.20
which, while it certainly does not amount tp, a protectorate, falls short of the diplomatic equality that existed (in theory at any rate) in the past. The advantage of co-ordinating all these spheres of activity under a single controlling agency needs no demonstration. It has, in fact, become an urgent practical necessity. The only question is what the agency is to be. The Parliamentary and financial objections to the creation of a new Ministry are fully appreciated; and it is possible that, in the circumstances of the time, they may prove to be insurmountable. But the India Office feels so strongly that the best solution lies in this direction, that it cannot refrain from pressing the suggestion once more upon the consideration of the-Cabinet.3. Failing a new Ministry, it remains to consider which of the existing Depart-ments of State is best qualified to undertake the task. Of all the practicable selections, that of the Foreign Office appears to be the least appropriate. The Foreign Office does not possess, and would not pretend to possess, administrative or .quasi-administrative experience. It is not organised on an administrative basis ; nor are its training and traditions such as to qualify it for administrative work. If it were to undertake the direction of Middle Eastern affairs, its personnel and machinery would have to be completely reorganised, with results that might seriously impair its diplomatic efficiency without providing a really adequate instrument for the discharge of its new liabilities. The point need not be laboured; so far as is known, it has never been in serious contemplation to entrust the new task to the Foreign Office.4. Next, in order of consideration conies the India Office, which lias already supervised the civil administration of Mesopotamia for over three years. The manner in which this task has been discharged comes in for severe criticism in a recent memorandum circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for War. It may not be out of place to offer a, few comments on some of Mr. churchill&apos;s strictures. In the first place it should be emphasised that the India Office, and not the Foreign Office (as Mr. Churchill suggests), is primarily responsible for what has been done, and must bear the chief blame if the work has been done amiss. Mr. Churchill, in the second paragraph of his memorandum, quotes various examples of what he regards as ill-advised activity on the part of political officers in Mesopotamia. Of these, the survey of a pipe-line to the Mediterranean was merely an appanage to the Haifa-Hit railway project--a purely military affair which in no sense derived its inspiration from the civil administration or the Secretary of State for India. The care of the Chaldean and Assyrian refugees was also undertaken by the military, not the civil, authorities; but in any case the duty of providing for people who had fought forms, and had in consequence been driven from their homes by our enemies, was a debt of honour which it would have been disgraceful to repudiate. What is meant by the &quot; general reconstruction of the Turkish province &quot; is not clearly understood. This is not the place to discuss the general considerations affecting administrative action in Mesopotamia. Perhaps the best answer to criticism is to be found in the actual situation as it stands to-day. Peace reigns in Mesopotamia, and law and order are effectively maintained there. Of what other area in the Middle East can the same be said ?5. Turning from the past to die future, it is not contended that the India Office is a suitable Department to control Middle Eastern affairs. It is true that, so far as Mesopotamia is concerned, the local authorities are in favour of remaining under the Secretary of State for India. Hut the India Office has its hands quite full enough already. The supervision of Mesopotamia has subjected its resources to a heavy strain, which has only been bearable because it was believed to be temporary. Increase of staff, or the creation of new Departments within the Office, might ease the situation, but would not go to the root of the difficulty. India is an all-sufficient preoccupation for a single Minister of State. To throw in the Middle East, with all its novel problems and complications, would impose upon the Indian Secretary a burden too great for one man. Moreover, Indian opinion would probably be all against the innovation. We should be told that India expected her Secretary of State to mind her own affairs, that it was derogatory to her dignity to be treated as a part-time job, and so forth, There would also be practical, administrative-difficulties. In India the Secretary of State in Council is the final financial authority ; in the Middle East the Secretary of State (the Council would have no authority ?) would be subject, like other. Ministers, to Treasury control.   This is not perhaps a.
&apos;     10necessarily fatal objection ; but the duplication of the Secretary of State&apos;s personality and functions would be a serious practical inconvenience. On every ground &quot;the India Office is of opinion that, in the best interests of the public service, the task should not devolve upon itself.G. :liere remains the Colonial Office. It is clear that this Department, in its present form and under its present designation, is not qualified to deal with areas which cannot by any stretch of imagination be described as &quot;Colonies,&quot; and which would undoubtedly take strong exception to such a description. It is, moreover, very desirable that nothing should be done to encourage the belief that a mandate is merely annexation in disguise. It is understood, however, that there is already some question of transferring from the Colonial Office the conduct of relations with the Dominions. If this transfer were accomplished, the amount of business left to the Colonial Office would presumably fall far short of its capacity. It is suggested that the vacuum might be filled with the Middle East, and that a renamed and reorganised Department, occupying the present Colonial Office building, might combine the function of administering the Crown Colonies with that of supervising the areas dealt with in this memorandum. The Secretary of State for India would be prepared on his part to accept transfer of Ceylon, which is becoming&apos; every day more closely connected, racially and economically, with the Indian peninsula. A point for con-si deration is the difficulty that may arise if the Foreign Office continue to control Persian affairs while the reconstituted Colonial Office deals with Mesopotamia. This difficulty might be met to some extent by the maintenance, in some permanent form, -of the present inter-departrnental Committee on Eastern Affairs; but the case of Persia, with which the Colonial Office would not perhaps be very well qualified to deal, affords an additional argument in favour of a new Department. In any case it need hardly be said that the Colonial Office would require a new staff recruited from those with special knowledge of, or service connected with, the Middle East.7. But whether the work is entrusted to a new Department or to a reconstituted &quot;Colonial Office, the need for consultation with other Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government will remain. The India Office and Foreign Office cannot disinterest themselves entirely, by a stroke of the pen, in the affairs of the Middle East. Questions will constantly arise upon which one or the other, or both, will have to be -consulted. Nor can the War Office, or the Treasury, be altogether eliminated. It would seem desirable, in order to ensure co-ordination and the maintenance of effective Cabinet control, to retain a standing inter-departmental Committee of supervision on something like the lines of the existing body. But it should be clearly laid down that the function of the Committee is to direct policy, not to interfere in everyday administration. Finally, it seems essential that, concurrently with the creation of the new Department, a new administrative Service should be organised for employment in the Middle East. The present arrangement, by which the local administrations have to depend on officers borrowed temporarily from any available quarter, is obviously a makeshift which cannot be continued indefinitely.8. To sum up, the India Office recommends (1) that all the Middle Eastern areas dealt with in this memorandum should be placed, under a single controlling agency in London; and (2) that that agency should preferably be a special Middle East Office, created ad lioc, and,failing that, the Colonial Office renamed and reorganised on the lines indicated in para. 6. It is considered that the Foreign Office should be definitely ruled out. Whatever Department may be selected, the retention of an. inter-departmental Committee of supervision, with functions limited to the direction of policy, is considered desirable. The creation of an administrative Service for the Middle East is also recommended.India Office, 1st June 1920.
