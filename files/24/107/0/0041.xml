gang -pocwm is Tia prokrty of his briiamic MM  !1 -2CABIMBtt. Copy 2toCP. 1441.Control of Wheat Prices.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries.The Agriculture BUI, to which the House of Commons has now giyon a second Reading by a large majority, has been well received, go far as its main principles are concerned, but much serious criticism hae been levelled by Agricultural Members against what they, consider to be the inadequacy of the inducements to grow wheat at home.The general trend of these criticisms has been that the guaranteed minimum price which is offered by the Bill is not sufficient to persuade farmers to increase, or even to maintain, the present area under wheat.   If this be so, the Bill obviously fails in one of the main essentials which the Government set out to secure, and it is important to consider, without delay, what - if anything - ban be done to make its policy effective.Personally I am unwilling to recommend that the basic minimum prices specified in Clause 2 (1) of the Bill should be increased, or extended to cover other kinds of produce.   Apart from the undesirability of adding, unnecessarily, to the prospective liability of the -Exchequer, there would be obvious objections to rejecting the advice of the Royal Commission on this point, more particularly as we have no other authoritative recommendations to accept in its place.There is, however, the concurrent recommendation of the Royal Commission (which appears in both the Majority and. Minority Reports ) that farmers should be allowed the free play of the market - above the minimum guarantee - subject to the State retaining the right to control prices in case of a national emergency.At present the position is that home-grown oats and barley are permitted to fetch their full prioe in the market, whereas wheat is still strictly controlled, at maximum prices of 76/8 for the 1919 crop, 95/- for the 1920 crop, and 100/- for the 1921 crop.   This control of wheat is a very sore point with the farmer, who finds&apos;in it, not merely what he regards as an injustice, but a deliberate discouragment by the State of wheat-growing as compared with other cereals.In consequence he is progressively disinclined to maintain, much less to increase, his wheat acreage, and last year&apos;s shrinkage of some 400.000 acres bids fair to be repeated this year - making a total reduction in two seasons of nearly all that was gained during the war.This is a lamentable, and most serious, development and it is imperative to check it.As already stated, 1 do not ask that the minimum prices set out in the Bill should be increased, but I do urge, most strongly, that the Cabinet should accept the&apos;advice of the Royal Commiseion and remove from home-grown wheat the present restriction of maximum prices. This concession, if announced immediately, would, I am convinced, greatly assist the passage of the Bill, and have a most stimulating affect upon this autumn&apos;s sowings of wheat. , The benefit to the farmer would be mainly psychological and the financial effect very small, so far as can be foreseen,   For example, the average free market price for the last few months has been undwr 100/*t whereas the controlled maximum prices are 95/- for 1920 and 100/- for 1921, The increased cost to the consumer should therefore &quot;be almost
negligible, whereas I am satisfied, not merely from the course of the Parliamentary debate, but froin consultation with many of the best agricultural authorities, that the announcement of a &quot;free market,&quot; if promptly made, would profoundly affect the situation and meet the main criticism of the Bill.I venture to urge the Cabinet to sanction this concession.L of P.11th June, 1920.
