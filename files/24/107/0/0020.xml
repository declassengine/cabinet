Referred to Committee of Home affairs this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC JA JESTYIS GOVERNIEENTp.0      iMiQR.iUDUM fffR HCH3, Ai^AIRS COMMITTED BY THE HINITER OP JJABOUR. PROVISION OP EARES AT RGDJOED RATES EOR SEASONAL AGRICULTURAL WORKERS.The question of the provision of travelling facilities for seasonal agricultural workers and especially for fruit pickers is now one of extreme urgency.    For the gathering ef tho fruit harvest, as well as of other crops, (potatoes, flax, etc.) it is always necessary for large numbers cf workers to bo imported to the districts ooneerned, to supplement the available local labour supply.     Thus for instance, the Kent and Wisboch and other fruit growers, regularly look to London to supply neoessary fruit-harvesting labour.    In Scotland the large fruit growing districts of Blairgowrie and Auohterarder draw their thousands if seasonal hands-from all Glasgow and parts of Sootland end North England.The soft fruit season is now imminent, but in the abBenoe of any arrangement being made with regard to travelling facilities, the greatest anxiety is being felt with regard to the recruitment of labour, and the neoessary arrangements cannot be completed until the question of railway fares has been decided.For many years a considerable proportion of the migrated labour required has been recruited by tbe Employment Exchanges.     It is regarded as impossible for this labour to be obtained in the neoessary numbers, unless some arrangement comparable with that in former years is made to reduce the cost of travelling to the workers,    The type of worker who, f*r years past, has been reoruited for this work is drawn from the labouring clasc, who are not in a position to pay, and have iniffact never been acoustomed to pay the normal fare.     The present enhanced rate of fares is, prohibitive for this class of worker having regard to the short duration of the work and the uncertainty of the earnings.ftfi
In view of the importance of the food supply question, it would be a very serious natter should there be, owing to lack of labour, a failure to harvest the various crops.It would appear that the cost involved in tho issuo of railway tiokots tc tho bona fide seasonal agricultural worker would in the circumstances bo a proper national charge and one which might reasonably bo borne by the Ministry of transport.    The Ministry of Labour would, of course bo preparod to render assistance to the Hallway (Jompanios with a viow to preventing uisuso of such cheap*warrants.In pro-war times and up to midsummer 1917 it was the normal.practice of tho various railway companies concerned to issue toseasonal workers proceeding to harvost work,,.fruit picking, etc.return tiokota at reduced fares, tho usual rate in the case of the1English railways being a return ticket for 1^ single faro, while in the case of Scotland (Blalrgowrle) return tickets were issued fora single fare.In the summer of 1917 the Railway Executive Ocmmittee decided to cease tho issue of any specially reduced tickets.     In that year the Ministry of Labour and the Board of Agriculture after consultation with the Ministry of Food, and Ministry of National Service jointly sought and obtained sanction from tho Treasury, a3 a war measure, for the issue of return warrants for persons proceeding tc seasonal agri-cultural work at tho rate of return ticket for      single fare at pre-war rates.    In the case of Scotland a further concession was obtained for tho issue of a return fare at pro-war single rate.    Similar sanction was obtained foie tbo harvest season of 1918, the difference between the full fare and the faro aotually paid in respect of the    worker being charged to tho vote of the two Departments concerned./In 1919
*^   MlTn. 1919 similar responsibility was undertaken by these two  apartments as an emergency measure, the Hallway &quot;Executive Committee having stated that the Railway Companies wore not at that time in a position to resume their pre-war arrangements for this purpose.    Later, the Board of Agriculture having transferred to the Ministry of Labour their share of recponsiblity in connection with recruitment of labour, the Ministry cf Labour undertook tho entire charge.It was hoped that in the present year such emergency action on the part of the Ministry of Labour would no longer be necessary and that railway companies would provide the facilities afforded in pre-war times to this class of worker.    Accordingly early ir. the spring of this year the Ministry of labour approached the Ministry of Transport on the subject.    Similar representations a  to the necessity of cheap travelling facilities being provided have been made by the Board vf Agriculture and Ministry of Food.    All these departments are in accord as to the extreme importance cf the necessary concessions being granted, and as to the desirability of these being provided in the normal pre-war method by the Railway Companies.     The issue of warrants by the Ministry of Labour and Beard of Agriculture involved not only an additional heavy burden of work en the Departments but proved inconvenient to a number of workers who for geographical and other reasons could not readily avail themselves of these arrangements.    Up to the present, however, the Ministry of Transport have not seen their way to accede to the representations made.     In oonsequenco, it has not been possible either for the machinery of the Exchanges or for the growers to make the necessary arrangements for securing labour for this work and the fruit harvest is now Imminent.    From the growers expressions of great 1 anxiety have been received, notably from Scotland and from the East Anglian areas; and appended is a resolution recently forwarded by the Parliamentary Committee of the Scottish Trade Union Congress.
I desire to point out that a worker procec. ing tp fruit picking cannot be regarded as ,m excursionist on pleasure bent, but is a bone fide worker, engager&quot; on productive work, and that the question of the granting of cheap faros to such workers should not bo prejudiced by the decision that no concessions can bo made in the case of holiday rankers.In vIyjw of the importance of the harvesting of the&quot;fruit crop, the impossibility of obtaining the requisite labour if tho worker is required to pay tho full faro, and tho hardship which will accrue to the fruit growers, if, at this late hour, the usual concession is withheld, it is urgci! that special facilities should bo afforded by the Railway Companies.    The cost to the Ministry of Trabsport should be considerably less than  16,000*    Tho total cost to tho Hxchocuer in the year 1919-19 20 for advances of fares in respect of all classes of workers (including seasonal workers) did not exceed . jih&amp;t araohnt*This Statement has been a greed by representatives of the Mini .tries of pootf, (Mr, j. J3. Beresford) Agriculture, (Mr. Bt. V&quot;. Taylor) and Labour, and I now forward it with a request that in&apos;view of the urgency of the matter, a very early decision may be given.(Signed)   T* J, MACJSApJUMinistry of Labour, 7,6,20.
APPSNDI1 I.RESOLUTION OF THE PARLIAMENTARY CCMMITTES OF THE SCOTTISH TRADES UNION CONGRESS 31.5.20,&apos;Hc doajjrci to express our Indignation that natyrlth-standlngthe urgent noud for inoroasei prcduio^lc.n^o j ood stuffs and employment, the Government, while granting reduced faros to Juvenile holiday Oampss are proposing to withdraw the cheap Railway faros granted for tho last 15 years to thousands of womon works rei in Scotland going to the Fruit Harvest, thereby not only inflicting, a jgr oat, hardship-on- a specially necessitous class ot? workers, many of whom are engaged in the season trades, but also involving sorious loss of valuable crops of food stuff, and inflioting a further blow on the Fruit-growing Industry, which in Sootland is largelycarried on by working-men Small Holders.V,n protest against tho proposed withdrawal of the necessary travelling facilities to the workers, and demand that the reduced faros bo continued as usual.
