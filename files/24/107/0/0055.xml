Government of Ireland Bill.FURTHER FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM.I.The memorandum on the Financial Provisions of the Grovernment of Ireland Bill (Cmd. 645), which was circulated last March, contained a number of financial statements which were based on the latest available estimates of revenue and expenditure for the then uncompleted financial year 1919/20. The amount of the Irish contribution to Imperial liabilities and expenditure fixed by Clause 21 of the Bill, and the apportionment of the contribution between Southern and Northern Ireland, were based on the same estimates.It is now possible to revise the calculation on the basis of &quot;the actual net receipts of Revenue and the Exchequer issues for the past financial year. It must be borne in mind that Exchequer issues are only an approximate measure of the expenditure of the year. It should also be mentioned that so soon after the end of the financial year the figures of net receipts of Revenue must be regarded as provisional.Details of the revenue and expenditure so revised will be found in Tables I and II below.   The results may be stated as follows :-Expenditure-(Exchequer Issues 1919-20).	Total.	Southern Ireland.	Northern Ireland.Irish Services...............

It is also possible now to show the financial effect of the Bill on the basis of the Budget Estimates of revenue and expenditure for 1920/1 and details are shown in Tables III and IY. In the previous estimates.a sum of  2,000,000 was included on the revenue side to represent the yield of a permanent tax in place of the Excess Profits Duty, while a sum of  4,000,000 was included on the expenditure side to provide for new services about to mature. Having regard to the new taxation imposed in the current year, it is no longer necessary to include any margin for a further tax in place, of Excess Profits Duty. It should be mentioned, however, that, on the ultimate cessation of the Excess Profits Duty there would, under existing business conditions, be a material increase in the yield of income tax, and nothing1 has been inserted on account of this increase. A part of the new services to be covered by the  4,000,000 included on the expenditure side for 1919/20 is now provided for in the Estimates for the year, viz. :  Old Age Pensions under the Act of 1919      ......    1,380,000Housing   ...      ..................      825,000Land Purchase (Bonus and Excess Stock)      ......       106,000 2,311,000There remains a sum of  1,689,000 still required.But the Budget estimates for 1920/1 do not include the yield of the new taxes for a complete year. The additional yield anticipated for a full year in Ireland is  1,740,000. If the margin for future expenditure is included, this future revenue clearly ought also to be included.As before, Excess Profits Duty is entirely excluded, along with the Bread Subsidy, and any other Ex-War services which could be treated as Irish services under the Bill.The following are the estimates of the financial results of the Bill on the basis of the year 1920/1 with the modifications explained above : 	Total.
