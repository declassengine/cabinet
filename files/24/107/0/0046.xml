SECRETyFor the information of Members of the Board.This Document \s the Property of weekly   APPRECIATION OF   MATTERS   OF   NAVAL   INTEREST.    No.77.Transport &quot;STEIGERWALD&quot; and Hospital Ship t!AGADIR&quot; sailed from England on 4th and 5th Juno respectively, for Flensburg.Cruise of Battle Cruisers.&quot;HOOD&quot; and &quot;TIGER&quot;, with &quot;SPENSER&quot; and accompanying T.B.D&apos;a, arrived at Kioge Bay on 1st June,   The T.B.D&apos;s proceeded to Copenhagen on the 2nd to fuel, returning to Kioge Bay on the 3rd. Next day the Battle Cruiser Force proceeded to Kalmar.   Approval has been given for the visit to Kic^e Bay from 12th - 14th June to be omitted in order to enable the Squadron to return the hospitality shown them at Kalmar and Stockholm.   The Squadron will therefore proceed to Apenrade from Nynashamn on 14th June-The recent visit of H.K.Ships to Swedish ports is reported by Naval Attache to have had a marked beneficial effect.   The Swedish official attitude is most friendly and reflects the changed public opinion.Commander H.R.IL Prince Axel of Denmark, in the capacity of Naval Officer of Danish Mission? inspected the sloop &quot;Asphodel&quot; at Devonport on 4th June; and negotiations continue as to the. sale of, one of these vessels to the Danish Government.   The Danish Government have authorised the Danish Minister in Paris to sign Schlesvig Convention without alteration.   They intend to carry ratification Rigsdag as soon as possible after signa-ture.   After ratification it is the present intention of H.M. King of Denmark to pay five days&apos; visit to Schlesvig.Aaland Islands.The political agitation over the future of these Islands has assumed a more critical phase.   The Aalanders themselves are determined to be united to Sweden, this view being encouraged &quot;by the latter.   The Finnish Government consider that if the Supreme Allied Council were to make a declaration to the effect that they are taking into consideration the just claims of both Finland and Sweden,, it would have a sedative effect and prevent the Aalanders from taking impulsive and drastic action, which may lead to serious consequences between Finland and Sweden.   The.previous Allied decision was that, in view of the geographical and strategical position of these Islands with regard to the command of the Gulf of Finland, the wishes of a future stabilised and recognised Russian Government must be considered, and until the latter matured the cuestion should be held over. The inference was to leave it to the League of Nations to settle, but this latter course,in view of recent developments, is not acceptable to the Scandinavian and Finnish Governments ao n-cerned.   H.M.Minister at Helsingfors points out that, while sympathising with the principle of self-determination, the close proximity of these Islands to Finland is in favour of Finnish claims, as the practical difficulties of Customs, etc., if under. Swedish control, will lead to constant friction between Finlandx and Sweden.&apos;VA\For   the   week   ended   5th   June   1920.BALTIC.Denmark.
Finland..The torpedo craft presumably reported as lost on 22nd -23rd December 1919, are new stated to be Cvl, 0.2 and C.3, - all old torpedo boats.   The loss is attributed to snow storms and drifting ice,Reported Movement of Bolshevik Ships. . ;It is reported from   Helsingfors that the Soviet Government-has announced its intention to send warships from lielsirigfors for &quot;hydrcgraphical and pilotage purposes&quot; .Esthpnla.The Government have expelled all Russian anti-Bolshevik elements and have forbidden citizens to bake part in anti-Bolshevik agitationsv    H.M.Commissioner reports that the Esthonian Government is fully alive to the importance of economic reconstruction, and that economical agreements based on timber and flax trade with the United Kingdom will mature. This satisfactory attitude is of particular Naval interest; as it tends to insure the necessary financial guarantee with regard to the sale by the Admiralty of the craft asked for by the Esthonian Government in formation of a defensive Navy, It may also be mentioned that a similar a&amp;bnomlo attitude Is shown by Latvia., which Is satisfactory with regard to her desire to acquire British ships.   Their power to provide and pay for defensive forces In the early future must be.kept in view, and their orders will undoubtedly be courted by the Great Powers. Reliable reports show that their inclination is to go to Britain for ships and also direction in the formation of these inevitable police forces -   The Esthonian Government has started negotiations for the Importation of Esthonian gold into England and for the use of one of H.M.Ships-for this purpose.Latvia,.Slight disturbances occurred at Riga on 1st June between soldiers from Libau and. Jews.    It Is reported from Moscow that a part of the Lettish peace delegation has returned to Latvia on the pretext that negotiations are not going well.   The Latvian Government have reiterated their offer through S.N.O., Baltic, to purchase the following craft from II,M.Government to form a nucleus of a Latvian Naval Force, viz:-pour submarines, 650 to 800 tons. 8 Coa. 1 burning T.B.Drs .20 Minesweepers of about 300 tons displacement for s/M. Chasers.10 Flying Boats.Outfits of ammunition for all vessels.Also to charter some minesweeping sloops for sweepingand cargo carriers -   They press for an early reply.RVM.Commissioner reports that the recent negotiations for setting up economic machinery to stabilise currency between Great Britfin and Latvia had a set-back, owing to the fault of M.Purin, Latvian&apos;Minister of Finance, but that the Government were repudiating M.Purin&apos;s action in order to resume the negotiations *W/^huanla.The progress of the peace overtures with Soviet Russia isslow
slow and obscure.   The Chiefs of the delegation were returning to Kovno from Moscow.    Indications point to Soviet policy being directed to make use of Lithuania&apos;s antagonism to Poland by using her as a threat to the Polish left flank.   Bolsheviks insist upon Lithuanian help to clear and protect their right flank,   Lithuania still refuses to treat with Poland or give any promise unless the independence of Lithuania with Vilna as capital is acknowledged by the latter.   They promise, .however, to take no action until the opinion of the British Government is received^   Lithuania has mobilised her army, but states it is only a precautionary measure.   The Government earnestly desires the guidance of the British Government in their policy. Commercial agreements have been signed between the Government and British Chemical Bank of London governing the flax and timber trade.   This should have a marked stabilising influence on the commercial situation.Trade.M.Krassin and his confederates continue negotiations in London with H.M.Government.. The Admiralty and War Office have put forward their respective demands on the Bolshevik Government which. In their view, must be met before any economic agreement is effected.Russian Internal Conditions,Krassin is stated to be convinced that the extreme type of Bolshevism is dying out, and is therefore struggling hard to keep things going by exaggerating the good trade prospects In Russia,KI!:r!L LeJL Relief Expedition.Press reports of 2nd June state that the Icebreaker &quot;SVIATOGOR&quot; will leave as soon as M-Litvinov confirms the statement that the Soviet Government will undertake entire economic responsibility Including insurance of the &quot;SVIATOGOR&quot;.Murmansk Area.The Soviet Government have instituted the Free Trade policy with regard to the fishing trade, in order to encourage this industry.Poland.The Poles claim to have held up the   Bolshevik offensive. The line on 2nd June ran Woloki - Dolhinov - IDody - Drissa in the Northern sector.   Fighting with Budenie&apos;s cavalry continues, General pilsudski remains convinced of the imminent internal disruption of the existing Bolshevik Government.   Reports from reliable Lithuanian sources state that the Bolshevik counter-offensive Is temporarily stopped to prepare for the offensive in a month or more to give time to re-organise transport, which is the main difficulty.   The Russian Bolshevik strength and war ardour with the will to win even If war continues into next year is re-affirmed by the same reliable source.   The mestion of the small Russian detachment under General Makhov at Danzig, who volunteered to serve with Poland1s Army is not yet settled by the Paris Cound 1.

Ukraine.Latest reports received from Kiev state that the town itsalf and surrounding districts are in a terrible state.   No factories are working.   Agricultural industry has been brought to a standstill by recent military operationsi   The Polish-Ukrainian troops1 entry into Kiev was wildly acclaimed by the population, but this attitude Is attributed more to relief after passing through a period of severe tension than affection for the Poles.   British Military Mission, Crimea, have been asked to report on the truth of reported agreement between General Wrangel and the Ukrainians.   M.Tc dtcherin has sent to the Foreign Office a protest by Soviet Government on the Polish^ression against the Soviet Ukraine.B&amp;ACK SEA, CASPIAN AND MEDITERRANEAN.Crimea.The situation in the Crimea is unchanged.   Patrol activity only, on both sides, is repotted.   General Percy reports that the morale and the discipline of General irangel&apos;s forces are now very good.Armistice Negotiations.iGeneral ifrangel&apos;s proposal to send M.Struve to London as a delegate to state his case In view of altered conditions has been replied to by Lord Curzon, who states&apos;that he sees no reasons for the delegate^to come to London.   Admiral de Robeck has been instructed to make it quite clear to General Wrangel that he must not expect any change in our policy as the result of the Polish offensive.   H.to.Government are determined to bring hostilities in South Russia to a close as soon as possible.   It Is aiso to be explained that General Wrange! is not being left to negotiate with the Soviet Government.   The latter have agreed to participate if a British Military representative and a political Officer - Mr.Picton Bagge - is being sent to assist as soon as possible.Caucasus.It is reported that the version of Bolshevik intentions, current in the Caucasus, is to the effect that Persia will be attacked, and Georgia also, if the latter accepts the Allied occupation of Batum.   Both the Commander-in-chief, Mediterranean and General Headquarters, Constantinople, report that there is considerable anti-British feeling amongst the Georgians, the former stating that this is-especially so at Gagri.   The opinion among the population of Sukhum province is that Georgia will attack Batum.   The Bolsheviks and Georgians have established a neutral zone between the Mekhaduir and Psu Rivers (in the coastal area, between /idler and Gagri).Russian Volunteer Fleet.Admiral Gerasimov has been relieved as Chief of Staff by Admiral Sabline;   Captain Phillimore, R.N., of Naval Mission,reports
reports that this appointment should have a beneficial effect and hasten much-needed reforms in the Fleet5 s organisation.,A^erbai;jan.Commander-.in-Chief, Mediterranean, reports 60,,0,00 Red troops in country.   Polish Mission arrested at Baku.   Latest reports of the British Naval prisoners at Baku indicate that they are receiving more severe treatment than other Allied nationals by being kept under arrest when others are on parole.   They are detained outside the town but are allowed to play games.   The government have forbidden all persons either to enter or leave Baku.   Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, reports that the Italians still have official representatives at Baku.    A Chresvichaika has been established and many executions are taking place.(^eorgl^a.Commander Luke renews his appeal to lord,Government that Georgia be supplied with arms and states Georgia is ready to pay cash for them.   He considers that unless -material support is given to the Georgian Government, it will turn Bolshevik.    He considers the risk of the arms being used against us if Georgia subsequently turns Bolshevik must be taken, and Is well worth it In view of our loss of prestige through recent events at Enzeli.   Armistice negotiations with Bolsheviks have been unsuccessful and fighting continues on Eastern frontier, C-in-C, Mediterranean, considers prolonged resistance unlikely unless immediate help in munitions is sent&quot;Armenia.commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, reports that Armenians are taking severe measures against internal. Bolshevism but are in urgent need of help.   They are willing to conclude a military alliance with Georgia,   He also states that Bolsheviks are making preparations for an Invasion of Georgia and Armenia.Black Sea Provinces.A neutral zone now exists between Medjadir and Psu Rivers, Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, reports two Divisions and two Regiments of-Red troops are identified by fairly reliable information at Novorossisk;   Djubka one regiment and at Sochi an artillery regiment of 3 battalions with 6 British guns each, together with 96 machine guns.-    Cossack anti-Bolshevik risings are reported in Ekaterinodar and Rostov districts.TURKEY.Nationalist Movement -The Nationalists are tlying to impress the Allies by the position   which they can create by uniting with the Bolshevists. The danger of such co-operation is undoubtedly being increased by the present Bolshevist action in Trans Caucasia.   As regards (I the Treaty Mustapha Kemal at present refuses to acknowledge the powers of the Turkish peace delegation.The
ft .   - 6The Nationalists;, whose intention now that they have cleared the Bigha - Panderma area of Government troops appears to ho an advance on Haldar Pasha via Shile, boast of their intentions to reach Constantinople; but say they do not wish to attack the British, though they will do so if tide movement is &apos; opposed * Anti&quot;British feeling now runs high in Anatolia and especially about Broussa.    Outside the area between Ismid and Chataidja&apos; the Government are powerless, and here they only hold sway thanks to the Allied forces.General Milne intends to hold the Ismid - Shile line and to resist any aggression in the Isnid Peninsula..   This is absolutely necessary since there will certainly be trouble In Constantinople if the Nationalists are allowed to get any closer.    They are at, present little more than an armed mob., but may ciuickly develope into an Army once they are in touch with the Bolshevists In the Caucasus&quot;A serious situation will obviously arise should the Nationalists decide to advance to the Bosporus, as this must bring them into contact with our military and naval forces.   The British High Commissioner is pressing for a decision as to our policy in the event of such an advance.A dieouieting feature is that no assistance can be. looked for from the French or the Italians.   The former wish to discredit our policy,, the&apos; latter are frankly Nationalist.    (In this connection it is of interest to note that while British officers are prisoners of-war in Anatolia there Is a French Mission established at Broussa).:The employment of Greek troops near Ismid is impossible and would probably lead to the mi ssacre of Christians in the interior,Fnance and Italy endeavour to hold us entirely responsible for the existing situation and at the sane time carry on an anti-British propaganda to the effect that the Ottoman Government are backed by the British alone in their endeavours to crush the Nationalist movement, and that the drastic Peace. Terms ere due -solely to British insistence overcoming French and Italian un-willingness to deal so harshly with Turkey,   The arrival of an Italian Division&apos; at Stamboul will &quot;be therefore u;ore a source of weakness than strength.As regards Smyrna the embargo placed by the Supreme Council on Greek offensive &quot;action there-, is evidently appreciated by the Nationalists, whom it sets free to deal piecemeal with the opposition to them..East of Ismid the Government: have failed to make, any headway against the Nationalists, who represent the intensity and energy of the Turkish nation.   Following on the capture of Sabanje and Arifie the Nationalists surprised and captured Adabazar.    The Government troops declined, to fire on their, co-religionists and either bolted.or melted away.   There were no casualties but twelve leading citizens were hung.   The British Military Intelligence officer was captured but was treated with courtesy nid has now been released.On the 1st instant skirmishing was reported S. and S.E. of Ismid and a railway bridge was blown up between Ismid and Hereke, and.in consequence railway.and telegraphic communication between Constantinople and Ismid was. severed but has now been restored.Sharp
Sharp fighting between Nationalists and anti-Nationalists in the Ismid area was reported on the 3rd instant -At the moment the Turkish Government appears to contemplate no fresh hostilities.   Anzavur has withdrawn to Constantinople in disgust 5The interior of Anatolia is ouiet, but at Blgna :tli&apos;o Christians are showing signs of panic-   They are not allowed to leave the town or to receive or send telegrams.The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean; in a telegram dated the 31st May, reports that Nationalist Troops hold Ismid,K, M, Shi ps n Kami Hies&quot;, &quot;Pegasus&quot; and &quot;Sirdar&quot; are at present at Ism id.Peace .The full test of the Treaty has now arrived in Constantinople and Is under discussion.The Sultan has addressed a- personal appeal to the King for the mitigation of the Peace Treaty and has received a reply that the future of Turkey is in the hands of the Allied Governments who may be trusted to act with justice to all parties and interests concerned. - .A. report of the 1st instant from Rome states that the des-p.-ton of Italian troops to Constantinople is still undecided. The advent of the troops, If it takes place,, will confront our .High Commissioner with a serious problem;  in view of the activities and methods employed by Italy   at Constantinople.   The Italians   -are anxious that these troops shouldpccupy a zone on the Asiatic side of the Bosporus-   British troops at present hold.the Ismid Peninsula and bar the Nationalist advance to Haidar Pasha;    should this occupation pass to the Italians this security vanishes and our position would be weakened both politically and militarily. It is preferable that the Italians should take over the Asiatic shore of the Sea of Marmora as far as Panderma, with Headmarters at Chanak.    This arrangement would leave the French In G-allipoli, the Italians retaining two battalions in Constantinople as at present.It has been reported, and denied, that the French are about to withdraw from. Cilicia.They are also reported to have concluded an Armistice with Mustapha Kemal   nd to have advised the Armenians to come to terms with Turkey.Thrace,Thrace remains ruiet but the situation Is,threatening and the population undoubtedly intends to oppose the Greek occupation. The Turks are carrying out an extensive mobilisation, on the ground that Greek agents provocateurs are about to provoke disturbances in order to precipitate Greek intervention,There are reliable reports that the Greeks intend to land two divisions at an early date on the N, shores of the Sea of Marmora,    Such action; before tie signing of the Treaty, will precipitate a crisis in Thrace and Constantinople.   The Greek Government is being pressed to consult Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, before taking such a step.Three
Three large Turkish magazines at Bulair were blown up on&apos; the 28th May,On the 12th May the Greek Gov rnrnent was reported to be much oerturbed by the news that til French troops in Thrace had been ordered to concentrate near Constantinople, so leaving the Turks in E.Thrace free to make all preparations for resisting the Greek occupation. , -  ;On the 14th May MvVenizelos was informed that French troops were a bout to evacuate VI.Thrace and Coritza, and that the&apos; Allies agreed to immediate Greek occupation of these districts.   Pie was greatly pleased at this news as indicating (a) that evacuation of W,Thrace would mean a temporary increase of French troops in 5cThrace, (b.) that Greek occupation of E.Thrace would soon be authorised.The French troops commenced their withdrawal on the 21st May, and immediately the Bulgarian population of Thrace commenced to leave, destroying crops and abandoning all they could not take with, them,On 29th May the situation was reported as follows: - &apos; The French troops&apos; had completed their evacuation of W.Thrace   being replaced by three Greek battalions, one at Dedeagatch, one at Gumul-ihno, one at Xaragatch.   Three Greek divisions were available, one of them being of bad ouality and doubtful loyalty.   The French civilian administration of W.Thrace had withdrawn (this had been remarkably successful) ?..nd no staff of Greek adminis-administrators had replaced them.   The Bulgarian population had emigrated en masse taking all their cattle *nd waggons with them. As they possessed practically all the means of transport the-harvest will be ruined.&apos; The railways which were worked by Bulgarian personnel had d s-continued service and the telegraphs and civil administration had likewise/ceased functioning, /entirelv Skirmishing between Greeks and Turks &apos;was reported.In S.Thrace Jaffar Tyar disposed of 12,000 men and it was understood he would dispute a Greek advance.   He had re-ceived arms from Bulgaria and also possessed a large number of mo chine and field guns.   -There were no Allied troops in E.Thrace vi of Hadem Eeui.        C&apos;YRIAThe Emir Feisal has addressed a message to the British Prime Minister in which he accuses the French Military authorities of Beirut of arming Syrian Christians ,gainst their Moslem fellow-countrymen.   Ke claims that the Moslems and Christians have hitherto always lived together like brothers, and points to the fact that In the Eastern Zone no animosity appears to have set one against the other.   He thus ignores the attacks by Arabs on Christian villages and the massacre of their in-habitants, which are probably to some extent&apos;the reason for any arming of Christians which may have taken place.Feisal begs the British Government to intercede with the French to stop it, and to hand over the administration of the Syrian coast to the Government at Damascus.The Emir concludes by again excusing himself from leaving for Europe on account of the disturbed state of the country.It is reported in the press that General Gouraud, Frencti High Commissioner in Syria, will pay a visit to Lord Allenby at Cairo about June 15th.The
Tho Emir Said, grandson of Abd-el-Kader, with the permission of the, Conference of San Rerno is returning to Syria, whence he was previously expelled during the British occupationo   In an interview v*ith a French Journalist at Tunis he has stated that his arrival at Damascus will be the signal for the fall of Pel sal1.   Cues tinned as to the future constitution of Syria he replied that it must be one and indivisible under the one power to whom all Syrians appeal with all their heart, viaj- France and Prance alone . lie pro-poses to visit Constantinople on his way, where he hopes to find a means of being useful to France, as, though Syria is now independent, of the Turks there is still a religious bond between the Moslem world and StambouiUThe report of the occupation of Tlbnln on May 22nd is confirmed.   It was effected by a French column from Tyre,Northern Syria arid^ Cilicia.General Gouraud has arranged an armistice with Mustapha Kemal, to last for 20 days from midnight May 31st - June 1st. General Gouraud pointed out that, as Prance did not intend to retain Cilicia, no reason existed for further bloodshed-The country to the west of Adana is reported in the press of June 4th to be quiet, but the situation to the east is still causing considerable anxiety.ITALY,The resumption of negotiations between Great Britain, France and Spain -regarding Tangier has been the signal for a manifestation of interest in that country by Italy.In an interview at the Foreign Office the Italian Charge d!Affaires asked if Italy could participate in these,negotia-tions and was told that it was unlikely France or Spain would welcome her inclusion in   them,The reasons which prompt these activities are at present obscure.GERMANY.With reference to the situation .at Wilhelmshaven (and Kiel), where all naval officers have been relieved from duty and replaced by warrant and petty officers, the German Press announces the Reichswehr Minister Gessler proceeded to Wilhelmshaven on Whit Monday and Informed the present naval authorities that he had appointed Rear-Admiral Zenker to the command of the North Sea Station; that the Court of Eneuiry had established the fact that a considerable number of the officers of the base had committed no political offence and were therefore entitled to be reinstated; and that the 31st May had been fixed as the limit by which officers would have to declare whether they were prepared to resume duty under the republic or not-Note:-   Rear-Admiral Zenker was Assistant to   Admiral von Pohl w&apos;hen Chief of the Naval Staff early in the war,HUNGARY.The Hungarian Peace Treaty was signed on the 4th June and
and will be known as the &quot;Traite de Grand Trianon&quot;.PRANCE;S,S.&quot;Oigan is expected to sail from Rosyth to Brest oh or about 9th June.   She will have no escort and has been allowed to Increase bunkers by 200 tons, in order that her British charterers may direct her for foreign ports without returning to the United Kingdom on discharge of French munitions *MEXICO.The Commander-.in-Chief, North America and. West Indies repor that the situation in Mexico no longer requires the presence of a British man-of-war.H.M.S*&quot;Cambrian&quot; has left Mexican waters.MISCELLANEOUS HOME INTELLIGENCE. Merchant ^Shipbuild ing in Devonport Dockyard.Fresh proposals for a solution of the Shipwright problem (waiving of demarcation rules) have been under discussion by the National Executive of the Amalgamated. Union,   The Shipwright ballot, reported in last week2s Summary, being the vote of one section of the Union only, is not apparently effective, and a fresh ballot of the whole of the members in the organisation, which includes Shipwrights, boilermakers., iron and steel ship-builders, blacksmiths, etc.&apos;&apos;, has been recommended.BMphreaklng Company at Dover.The Stanlee ship breaking Company are negotiating for the Submarine Harbour and an area of ground at Dover.   The Company has bought the &quot;Canopus&quot; and &quot;Duncan&quot; and has been granted permission to berth them at Dover shortly.Dartmouth Harbour.The Dartmouth Harbour Commissioners propose to ask the Admiralty to move . H. M. S.&quot; Pomone&quot; and. the mooring trot further to the N.W. in order to give more room to mercantile vessels using the Port.Royal Marines for Ireland.A Battalion of Royal Marines left Devonport on the 3rd June in H.M. Ships &quot;War-spite&quot; and. &quot;Valiant&quot; for Queens town, for the protection cf Coast Guard Stations.Attack on Coast Guard Station at Fenit.An attack in force was made on the Police Barracks and Coast Guard Station at Fenit at 3 a.m. on June 2nd.   H.M.S. &quot;Urchin&quot;&apos; was in the vicinity at the time and landed an armed party.   The Ship also used her searchlights and armament, which caused the rebels to retire, leaving some shot guns and signs of casualties behind.   The Coastguard Station was untouched, but the Police Barracks and two adjoining houses were gutted.
Hull S3 a Wool Port.The Government are going- to erect in the King George Dock, Hull, the largest wool sheds in the world, covering ten acres of ground.   Steamers from Australia and New Zealand will bring their wool cargoes to Hull Instead of London and Liverpool,.: the &quot;former port being in closer proximity to the Yorkshire woollen &quot;&quot;mills.Iron Trade in the North.The export of iron from the N.E. ports has practically ceased, owing, to the serious decrease in output.   The iron masters, by refusing to export and reserving the supply for home demands, are adopting a patriotic attitude, as continen-tal firms are offering fabulous prices for iron ore.General Situation in Ireland.The Railwaymen continue their policy of refusing, to convey or load munitions or military stores for the forces in Ireland. A similar course was adopted by the Dockyard Riggers and the&apos; crew of a dockyard tug detailed, to secure the Transport &quot;Czaritza&quot; on arrival at Queenstown.    It is believed this was due to Intimidation of the men.Attacks on Police Barracks continue.   Five or six took place during the week, but were in most cases beaten off.;MIRALTY, S.W.9th June 1920.
