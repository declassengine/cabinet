tociunent is the Property of Eis Britannic Majestys Governments     2 75I it 47 1Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1920.[&apos; Hall g ^CONFIDENTIAL.The following letter from Mr. Bobertson, Deputy High Commissioner . on the Rhineland High Commission, has been received in the Foreign Office. It seems to me of sufficient interest to be circulated to the Cabinet.0 of K.Goblenz, June 9, 1920. THE latest figures which we have to-day received from Berlin (they are not necessarily final) give the following resultsMajority Socialists Independent Socialists... CentreBavarian Volkspartei ...Deutsch Nationale YolksparteiDeutsche Volkspartei ...DemocratsCommunists ...OthersMaking a total of110 80 67 21 65 61 45 2 9460As was anticipated, there has been a heavy slip both to Bight and to Left, and the Centre Party is divided by the uncertain attitude of the 21 Bavarians. The Majority Socialists have lost about 55 seats, the Democrats about 30. The, Independent Socialists, the Nationalists and the Detftsche Volkspartei have made very heavy gains.As a result of all this, the situation is, to my mind, fraught with considerable danger. The present Coalition (the Majority Socialists, Centre and Democrats) together only total 243, if the Bavarians stick to the Centre. They would, therefore, scarcely have a working majority. If the Centre and the Democrats were to join with the parties of the Right, such a coalition would total 259, and be opposed by all the Socialist elements. There is one further possibility, the Deutsche Volkspartei might conceivably be taken into the present Coalition, but this would sound the death knell of the Majority Socialists.Nobody at present knows what is going to happen, but one thing is quite certain, and that is that the parties of the Right will wield very considerable influence in the Reichstag. If the Deutsche Volkspartei do join the Government, or if the parties of the Right form a Government with the Centre and with the Democrats, the Peace Treaty is likely to prove another &quot; scrap of paper.&quot; There is also the possibility to be borne in mind that the workmen may rise against a Government of the Right, which would certainly not make any serious effort to disarm or to disband the famous Free Corps, and would probably not really reduce the Reichswehr.The workmen of the Ruhr are, rightly or wrongly, genuinely afraid that the Monarchists are now going to make another &quot; Putsch &quot; and that they will make directly for the Ruhr in order to control that great industrial area. The workmen themselves would be powerless to resist any serious attack by force of arms. They have a certain number of rifles and a certain number of machine guns, but they have practically no guns nor aeroplanes nor tanks, nor anything to enable them to put up a prolonged resistance. They affect.to fear that the Monarchists, after having overrun the Ruhr, will proceed to attack the little force of half-trained boys whom we have sent to garrison the Cologne district, but I doubt if even the German Monarchists would be such fools as that.I have little doubt that we are in for a period of considerable unrest, and that even if civil war is staved off, no Government, formed as a result of the present elections, can last.   Ultimately we shall probably have a straight fight between the Right and the[3504]
Left, in which all the military power will be on the side of the former. The Allied Governments will, I hope, contemplate the probability that a considerable strengthening of the Armies of Occupation will become imperative.As to the Spa Conference, I hardly know what to say. The German Government represented at it will have no power to carry out any promises they may give and they will, of course, wriggle in all directions.In fact, the outlook, to my mind, is thoroughly bad&apos;aud the internal situation in Germany wants very close watching. If the Allies cannot speak with one voice, and that voice decided and firm, we shall have reaction back in the saddle in this country sooner than ever I had originally feared.Lord Curzon asked me, when I was in London, what were the powers of the President of the German Republic. The answer is that they are practically nil, and far less than those of the President of France. He is elected directly by the people for seven years, but cannot stir hand or foot without the consent of the Reichstag, and may be deposed by a plebiscite at the suggestion of the Reichstag. Treaties and alliances with Foreign Powers require the consent of the Reichstag, and a declaration of war or conclusion of peace require an Imperial Law. The Imperial Chancellor is appointed and dismissed by the President. Ministers are also appointed and dismissed by the President, but at the suggestion of the Imperial Chancellor. The Chancellor and the Ministers, however, require the confidence of the Reichstag in order to remain in office. Any one of them must retire if the Reichstag passes a vote of want of confidence against him.I see from the papers that the Spa Conference has been put off until the 5th July. By that time the new German Government should be&apos; fully formed, and the Allies will be able to judge what faith can be placed in it. If there is an element of the Right in it, it should be treated with the greatest suspicion, and I most earnestly hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government will realise that it is not France but the British Empire that is the ultimate goal of Prussian ambition, now as before the war. They feel that they can overrun France in a few weeks, and then will come our turn.. That that is the basic thought which in the future, as in the present and in the past, will guide the policy oi the Prussian Right, whether &quot; Deutsche Nationale,&quot; or the less extreme &quot;Deutsche YolHpartei,&quot; I have no doubt at all.   France and we must stick together !
