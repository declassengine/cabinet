DOCUMENT. IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJggTY^S GOjTOTjjgNTX.SECRET.. CABINS T.-Pc 147-9* J?LTOTITIONS (CESSATION)   BILL.Memorandum by the financial S-ecretary to the Treasury.r.&apos; ,       ; JThis Bill is drawn in view of the decision not to set up a Ministry of Supply, and the apparent desire of Parliament that the Ministry of Munitions should now be brought to an end.Under section 6 of the Ministry of Munitions Act 1915 the powers of the Ministry revert on its termination to the Depart- . ment from which they were transferred..    By separate Order in C-oun-, cil the normal functions of supply and the management of the Ordnance Factories are King retransferred to the War Office. Certain minor matters such as the purchase of Housing materials . and the duties of the Minister under the Petroleum Production Act will be transferred to the appropriate Department. . . iThere remain two important functions-, ,the disposal, of . surplus Government property and the liquidation of War Contracts . entered into by the Ministry which it is not practicable or   ... desirable to transfer to the War Off ice...,. It may be mentioned that It. is hoped to. realise from recoveries from Allies and the sale of surplus stores and of raw materials belonging to the Government, especially wool, some  20.0 millions of    revenue this   -financial year and upwards of  150 millions in 1921/22.    This work will continue for some two years, but it is hoped that the greater part of the liquidation work will be completed in about six months,   In order therefore to terminate the Ministry at an earlier date than that named in the Act of 1915 (twelve months after the termination of the war) it is necessary to make statut-ory provision for the exercise of the functions of disposal and liquidation.   In any case legislation would eventually be necessary to deal with the rights and properties; held by. the Minister,, the reversion of which is not covered by the Act of 191.5.
In view of the fact that the various branches of the Ministry&apos;s work enjoy common Finance, Accounts and Stores Depart---ments and a common secretariat which it would be administratively impossible to split up, it will be neoessary under the new scheme to retain,for the time being, a central organisation for those purposes.     It is proposed that this organisation should bestyled Disposal and Liquidation Commission and that it should beigiven power to sue and be sued and should be presided over by Lord Inverforth as Honorary Chief liquidator the Chancellor of the Exchequer having ultimate Ministerial responsibility.   It should be explained that Lord Inverforth while still willing to give the Government the benefit of his advice and assistance desires to be relieved of Ministerial duties in order that he may be free to give attention to his private affairs..It will be necessary that a Minister should be available to answer questions in the House of Commons and to introduce the estimates as is now done by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry, and it is accordingly proposed that one member of the suggested organisation shall be a member of the House of Commons. Fr,sh estimates for the current year will be required in the place of those already presented, but it is not anticipated that  here will be any considerable reduction of the net amount, as a result of the Bill, though, of course, considerable, liabilities-ties have already been taken over by the War Office from the Ministry.;I ask for Cabinet approval, of the introduction of the Bill.An alternative scheme which has been considered and whichwould also be possible under the Bill itself would.be to givestatutory existence under the Treasury to (a) the existing Dis-posal Board and (b) a new Board to be constituted, the liquidation-tion Board, the Treasury directing them to follow the instructtions of Lord Inverforth, as Honorary Chief Liquidator, whowould have a b&amp;eII staff of existing officials attached to him for/
for the purpose.    This schrirae while perhaps less open to tho criticism that it is a continuance of tha Ministrjr-of Tfluai.tj.ons under another name would have certain, administrative objections and is not preferred&apos;to the scheme&apos;put forward above.(ltd) S.B,Treasury, S.W.I.June 17, 1920,
