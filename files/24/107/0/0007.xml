curoent is the Property of His Britannic M^estya Government.)        jJQ* -Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1920.CONFIDENTIAL[201264]EXPORT OF COAL TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES.IN a memorandum of the 24th March, attention was drawn to the serious political and economical situation created by the shortage of coal in Italy, France, Portugal, Greece and Egypt, and the political results likely to How from our neglect to meet the minimum demands of these countries. The recent conference between representatives of the Foreign Office, Board of Trade, Ministry of Shipping and Coal Mines Department showed clearly that nothing further could he done to increase the quantity of coal for export without Cabinet sanction.2. The present coal situation is approximately as follows : Out of a production of 240,000,000 tons annually, home consumption can account for about 204,000,000 tons, whilst another 15,000,000 tons are needed for bunkering in the United Kingdom vessels engaged in the foreign trade. It is estimated that there will only be available for export during the coming twelve months 21,000,000 tons, or not more than 1,750,000 tons monthly.3. A specific agreement has recently been made with France whereby we engage to send to France monthly 45 per cent, of the output available for export, and special measures are now being taken by the Coal Controller to increase the quantities sent to Italy, up to about 20 per cent, monthly of the output available. As a result of these measures there will only be available for export to the remaining countries, dependent on the United Kingdom for their coaP supplies, a monthly quantity of 650,000 tons, of which overseas bunkering depots require at least a moiety.4. It will not therefore be possible for countries like Portugal, Greece, Egypt, not to speak of Switzerland and other ex-neutral countries, to secure supplies of coal for their bare,necessities : railways, other^public utility undertakings and various industrial concerns.Even with the special effort made to assist Italy, whole sections of industry in that country have been closed down, and the number of mechanics and metal-workers thrown out of employment has reached a dangerous level.In Portugal, unless coal supplies arrive from the United Kingdom in the near future, the entire railway system, gas and electric light and power works will be paralysed, and thousands of men thrown out of employment.In Egypt it is of primary importance that railway stocks, at present dangerously low, should continue to be maintained, as well as stocks required for raising water for&quot; the irrigation of the cotton and cereal crops.5. The dangers of economic or other reprisals, to which our present policy is leading us, cannot be minimised, and no amount of propaganda can counteract the impression which is prevalent now in many countries that Great Britain is deliberately hampering their industrial reconstruction by selfishly reserving for herself a raw material of which she, in present circumstances, holds what almost amounts to a monopoly. The delicate economic machinery of Europe is such that anarchical upheavals in any unit of the European system or political disturbances in the gateway to the East, due in large measure to the continued coal shortage, must inevitably have a psychological reaction on the masses in our own country.6. The policy of reserving our entire supplies for our own needs and of doling out favours to a few foreign countries to the exclusion of others is causing resentment, which will not diminish in the near future. It seems imperative that the question should be reviewed with the object of increasing, if possible, the quantities available for export. When this has been done, a more equitable system of distribution should be devised in the interests of the various countries concerned.130 [3400]
