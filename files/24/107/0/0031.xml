From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,Th!G D^&apos;&quot;*-!&quot;!&apos;:&apos;&apos;:8th June 1920. (Received 8tli, 10.30 a.m.)Clear the line.706 (? S). Very secret. Following appreciation of the present Bolshevik Afghan situation submitted in support of our telegram of 31st May, 673 S. 1. Bolsheviks, partly as&apos; the result of Polish successes which have necessitated transfer of troops to west, are very anxious regarding their position in Bokhara, * Khiva and Eerghana, and are nervous about Afghan assistance to Bokhara against Bolsheviks. Suritz has impressed upon Moscow that Afghanistan sets small value on mere promises of Bolsheviks, and is likely to be placated by nothing short of large and prompt supply of Bolshevik money and arms, both to Afghan and to frontier tribes. Moscow is willing to supply arms in return for definite quid pro quo, and Suritz proposed to submit to Amir draft of an agreement about 22nd May, but Moscow is apprehensive lest Amir, once he had obtained arms, may employ them not to aid Bolsheviks but to establish an Afghan hegemony of Mohammedan elements in Middle East.2. Bolsheviks are learning by experience that Afghans are not worthy of reliance, On the other hand, Bolsheviks&apos; power of offence is limited, and their position in Trans-Caspia insecure, unless they receive Afghan help; while Afghans realise wisdom of coming to terms with us, unless they can obtain certain and active Bolshevik help.3. We are entirely opposed to attempting any entente with Afghanistan as against Bolsheviks, and even were it possible to help Bokhara, which is inclined to look to us for help against Bolsheviks, we should be unwilling to do so through the medium of Afghans.4. Our policy should be to detach Bolsheviks from Afghans, vide our proposals of agreement with Soviet Government. In the meantime, in our conversations with Mahmud Tarsi, we have secured (corrupt group)&apos; initial success by the Afghans continuing conversations despite our categorical refusal to abandon Waziristanoperations.Ra
