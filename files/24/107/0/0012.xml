Dear Mr. Fisher.

I am desired by the Prime Minister to forward you the enclosed letter in regard to the Places of Worship (Enfranchisement ) Bill, and to say he is anxious that facilities should be granted for the passing of this bill. With this object in view, he will be glad if you will kindly have it considered soon by the Home Affairs Committee.

The Bill has been before Parliament on two or three occasions previously, and Mr. Lloyd George believes that it would be accepted in a non-controversial spirit.

Yours sincerely

As you well know, this Bill has in somewhat similar form &quot;been &quot;before tho two Houses in previous Parliaments, has passed its second Reading and boon subject to very thorough investigation and elucidation in Grand Committee.is his, to all intents and purposes/a measure which has tho approval oi all soctions in tho House, but as a private Member^ opportunities are very limited, we have venture .to approach you and the Government through the medium of the enclosed appeal for facilities, bearing the signatures of        Members of the House of all different parties.    We feel that the  1st of Signatures is by no means exhausted, and wo purpose to obtain and forward to you further Lists, &quot;but in view of our anxiety to secure facilities for the discussion and passing of the Bill through its various stages through the House with as small delay as possible, I am asked toiappeal to&apos; you to afford us such measure of benevolent consideration for.facilities for tho Bill as you- may find possibly consistent with the programme of Government business.-4Believe meYours Sincerely,(Signed) JOHLI HI1IDS. 0?he Right Don. U. Lloyd Georgo, M.P. 0J&amp;aTo the Right Hon. D. Lloyd George, M.P.We the undersigned Members of Parliament desire to appeal to the Government to afford facilities for the further stages I of the Places of Worship (Enfranchisement) Bill, which is now awaiting its/Second Reading.A Bill with the same objects in view was presented to parliament as long ago as 1895.   It was based on the recommendations of
a very strong Committe-o composed of Members from both sides of the House of Commons which reported in the year 1889.Since then tho Bill, has received a Second Resding on three distinct occasions, the last occasion being on April 3rd, 1914, whun it was passed without e. Division and sent to a Grand Cor-mittov, from which it emerged with slirht siritndments.The Bill now before the House is in the identical form in which it passed through Grand Committee in 1914, whop the outbreak of wa!r&quot; -prevented its further progress.It may further be pointed out, as indicating the general approval of both Houses, that an identical measure h-: s pass through the House of Lords on two o casions.(Signed by 147 Members from all sides of the House-f Commons) .2, Whitehall Gardens, S.
