summary.The predominant interest of the month has been in events and conditions in Russia, Germany and Poland.russia.The disarray in the affairs of the Bolshevik Delegation to Great Britain, due to the divergence of the policies of Krassin and Litvinoff, is now complete. Krassin, afraid that Litvinoff&apos;s threatened return to Moscow will end in his being stabbed from behind, pressed for Litvinoff s admission to the United Kingdom, and threatens to leave himself unless it is accorded. Despite this simulated solidarity, due as much to the need of having Litvinoff under his eye as to the hopo that by presenting a united front the Soviet regime may yet obtain the rolatkms with Great Britain which are its one chance. Krassiu&apos;s position in London is one of acute discomfort, largely because of the growing enlightenment of the press as regards the facts of the situation in Soviet Russia.GERMANY.There are indications of the imminence of another and more serious reactionary Putsch. Ludendorff and Falkenheim will be at its head, and have this time secured the co-operation of Monarchists in Hungary and Austria supported by a supply of arms from Italy. Matters are likely to be brought to a head late in June or in July. The policy thereafter is indicated as (1) a passive sabotage of the terms of the Peace Treaty, and (2) attacks on Poland, the Plebiscite Areas, the Occupied Territories, and Alsace-Lorraine.In the German elections which are shortly to take place it is probable that the majority Socialists will lose both to the Right and to the Independent Socialists, now hard pressed by the Monarchists, who advocate direct action.MAY DAY AND PRANCE.May Day in general passed off quietly. The exception was France, where the general revolutionary strike organised by the Confederation General du Travail ended in failure, a large number of Extremists being arrested, and the C.G.T. itself prosecuted. The C.G.T. itself will not be dissolved, the Government finding it necessary to balance tho influence of the Right.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.Information has been received from several sources of a Hungarian Polish sacret alliance against Czecho-Slovakia.JJ 2
CONFIDENTIAL.A review of Revolutionary Movements in Foreign Countries.part i.1. latin COUNTRIES.FRANCE.1. The Confederation Ge&apos;ne&apos;rale du Travail and the Strike.The great strike by whose success or failure the C.G.T. said it was prepared to stand or fall, has come to an end. The victory of the French Government is complete, and the prestige and power of the C.G.T. are for the time being broken.The strike lias been so fully reported in the newspapers that more than a bare summary of it here is not required.The French Government was aware that the O.G,T.&apos;s plan of revolution was largely the work of the followers of M. Caillaux and had taken early precautions.For the past six months, French secret agents have been warning the Government that the extremists in the country were preparing a revolution, which was to be preceded by a general strike. This strike was to be manipulated in such a manner as to paralyse the economic life of the country and bring about the resignation of the existing Government. The revolutionaries hoped then to be able to abolish Parliament and to set up a system of Soviets similar to those in Russia. This plot not only got to the knowledge of the Cabinet but to the ears of deputies outside, and some political juggling has undoubtedly taken place as regards recent Government action towards the C.G.T. It must be remembered that the C.G.T. is supported by a considerable Radical and Socialist element in the Chambre and in this way it becomes a powerful weapon in the hands of the Government against the Right Party. The Right Party is amxious to abolish the C.G.T. but M. Millerand is believed to be keenly averse to anything in that direction.At the instance of the C.G.T. a general railway strike was ordered at midnight on April 30th ; on 2nd May the C.G.T. ordered out the Dockers, Merchant Seamen and Miners and later the omnibus and underground services, with other trades less directly essential. The response to their, call was general, but the Government took prompt and firm action. Volunteers maintained the transport services. The most dangerous extremist leaders, e.g., Monatte, Director of &quot;La Vie Ouvriere,&quot; Sirolle, Secretary of the Railway Federation and Loriot, of the Federation Socialiste de la Seine, were arrested. Arrests of revolutionaries of varying degrees of redness amounted to 2,000 in all. Of these only about 200 have been charged, the rest being called upon for an explanation and then liberated. The railway companies also took the chance of dismissing some 5,000 &quot; undesirables &quot; in their service.
On May 11th, when it was clear that the situation was well in hand, many of the men having remained at or returned to work and the whole country being hostile to the strike, the Government ordered legal proceedings to be taken against the C.G.T. under a law of 1884, which limits the objects of track; unions or confederations of trade unions to &quot; the study and defence of their economic interests.&quot; Article 9 of this law of 1884 empowers the authorities to dissolve unions in the event of any infringement by them of the law under which they exist.The case against the C.G.T. was, in M. Millerand&apos;s words, that it had called the strike &quot; not in order to safeguard professional interests, but with a clearly defined political object that of obtaining a reform which the C.G.T. itself declares opposed to the wishes of the Govern-ment and of Parliament.&quot; M. Le Trocquer, Minister at Public Works issued a statement reminding the public that on February 24th, just before the railway strike, he undertook not to introduce a proposed Bill for the reorganisation of the railways without having previously discussed the question with the Economic Council of the C.G.T., and that the Confederation had ignored a thrice-repeated invitation from him to confer.The C.G.T. will not be dissolved ; now that it has got rid of its revolutionary elements it is likely to be asked to share in the govern-ment of the country, and it will work more closely with the Radical-Socialist section in politics. One outcome of the attempt to dissolve the C.G.T. has been to cause a greater antagonism between the Royal -ists who desired its dissolution and the Radicals. Had the Govcrn-ment been forced to resign on account of the recent troubles, Mons. Aristide Briand would have stepped into the place of M, Millerand.The revolutionaries had prepared elaborate plans, and in the event of a successful rising their Cabinet would have been as follows : Jou-haux, Minister of Labour ; Midol, Minister of Public Works ; Loriot and Souvarine, Ministers for Foreign Affairs ; Ex-Captain Sadoul, Minister for War and Prime Minister ; Monmousseau, Minister for Justice ; Sirolle, Minister for Commerce, etc. The chief plotters will be tried collectively and heavy sentences are likely.Special stress was laid in the C.G.T.&apos;s programme on the constitu-tion (1) of a national economic Committee to reorganise production ; (2) of an international consortium for the distribution of raw material; (3) of an international fleet to regulate freights. The programme also insisted on the necessity to control imports and to reorganise rail transport. It further included the International allotment of war burdens ; the economic entente of all peoples on a basis of eo-opera-tion ; the surcease of Colonial expeditions; and international d is -armament.The Right Party has been following the plot with attention. They were hoping to be able to take over power from the present Govcrn-ment, and their policy would have been a severe repression of the Syndicalists.The Confederation Generale du Travail permitted the Socialists, led by Tomasi and Francettc, to amalgamate with them in arranging the May Day demonstration, but decided that it would itself maintain control.May Day itself in Paris resulted in rioting, two persons being killed and 120 injured, including police, who charged the crowd and used their arms. Amongst those injured were Alexandre Blanc and Paul Vaillant Couturier, both Socilaist Deputies. Many rioters Avere arrested and some thrity sentenced to imprisonment.
The Confederation Generale du Travail has appealed for support against the action of the French Government to the Second Inter-national, which has replied that the. action of the French Government will be considered at the Brussels Congress in July next.During the Communist rising in Berlin letters from French Com-numists were found which showed that the leaders of the Communist movement in Paris have little hope of an immediate revolution. They complain of the ignorance and passivity of the mass of the people, and describe the organised workers as still under the influence of Nationalism and Chauvinism.2. French Socialists&apos; relations with Soviet Russia.In a letter to the Third International of Moscow, brought to LitvinofT early in April by Bombacci, the Italian Socialist envoy, Longuet writes that he cannot make his French comrades work to-gether with the Germans, the former being French before anything else. He says he has hard work righting against the military spirit of the workmen, who have formerly been soldiers, and are proud of having saved their country. The Bolsheviks&apos; French comrades cannot accept any money from Germany. An accusation by the Bourgeois press that they were in touch with what might be denominated &quot;camouflaged militarism &quot; would probably stop the already slow revolutionary movement altogether. The Soviet authorities must therefore contrive to send untainted money direct. Longuet, Loriot and others request the Bolsheviks to send them all possible information regarding the intrigues and suspicious conduct of the French bourgeoisie, so that they may publish it in their press.An American journalist named Paul de Mott was arrested by the German Government troops in the Ruhr district (Mulheim) with German soldiers of the revolutionary movement. He was sentenced to death, papers and letters of an extremely compromising character being found on him, including two lettters addressed to Trotsky and Losovosky (Dridzc) sewn into his shirt. These letters were written in French by L. Monatte from &quot; La Vie Ouvriere &quot; (a Bolshevik French paper of which Monatte is editor) dated 13th March, 1920. They alluded to the opportunity afforded by &quot; an American &quot; to transmit a &quot; few hasty words.&quot; La Mott was shot by a sentry when attempting to escape.3, The Confederation Ge&apos;ne&apos;rale du Travail and the French Occupation of Frankfurt.French Socialists and Syndicalists have made no serious pro-test against the entry of the French troops into the Ruhr district; but a delegation of the Confederation Generale du Travail recently waited upon M. Millerand who explained his conception of British policy in this connection and assured the delegates that the French advance was simply a manifestation of warning that France was determined to secure the fulfilment of the Peace Treaty. The extreme Socialists rejoice at the idea of a rupture between Great Britain and France, which would leave France free to make an alliance with Germany and Russia against Great Britain. The French Press, particularly the Radical and Republican-Democrat section, has recently shown great hostility to England ; Rowkanowski, a deputy in the Chamber, has declared that British Imperialism and British egoism go hand in hand as regards the Peace Treaty and the manipulation of the exchange. British action in the Near East has been severely criticised.
4. Extremists.The Congress of Ilailwaymen in Paris late in April came to an abrupt end when the delegates, rather than vote the resolution of the Minoritaires for an immediate general strike, preferred to close the meet-ing. The directing officials of the Railwaymen&apos;s Federation were changed soon after. The extremists, considering the dismissed leaders too weak in their policy, appointed successors with moro violent tendencies. Even Bidegaray was replaced as Secretary by Sirollc, one of those arrested during the recent railway strike. Other notorious extremists now elected as officials arc Levesque and Montmousseau.The French authorities are concerned about the large number of professors in French Universities whose political tendencies are con-sidered as detrimental to the welfare of the student and to French interests.  Several of these professors are Jews.- - Loriot has been elected General Secretary of the Socialist Federation of the Seine, a financial deficit having been discovered in the accounts of which he, as treasurer, had charge. Grandvallet, the new treasurer, is an ex-railway official and an ardent supporter of direct action.Von Schubert, of the German Embassy in London, was recently at San Remo, as was also Malatcsta. An organisation, whoso chief agents are known to the French police, has been formed there, to link up with the German agents and foment labour troubles in France.Alexandre Schliapnikoff, Russian Soviet Minister of Labour, has notified the Paris extremists of his intention to visit France to explain to the working classes the exact state of affairs in Russia. He was signalled as leaving Stockholm for Germany, England, France and Italy towards the beginning of the month. Steps have been taken to refuse him entry to the United Kingdom. The French Comitc des Syndicats Minoritaires intend to reciprocate by sending a delegation to Russia.The journal &quot; Clark&apos; &quot; has, since its inception a year ago, been supported by voluntary contributions from sympathisers and adherents to &quot; De Groupe Clark&apos;.&quot; It is now in financial difficulties. The price is being raised to 25 centimes, the directors having announced a deficit of 4,000 francs on the working expenses. When, during the war, Romain Rolland received the Nobel prize of 150,000 francs, he gave a large proportion of it to support &quot; Clark&apos;,&quot; and John de Kay is believed to have given money to Henri Barbusse for the same purpose.BELGIUM1. Political.In spite of the pre-arranged opposition of a number of liberal and Catholic Deputies, the Cabinet over-rode the dissent of the Ministers of the Interior and Public Instruction and decided to accept the Belgian-Dutch Frontier Treaty, a step which should improve commercial rela-tions between the two countries.A political crisis was expected early in April, when it was doubtful whether the three Socialist members of the Cabinet should remain in office. The annual Congress of the Belgian Labour Party decided that unless the Government dealt promptly with the high cost of living, guaranteed the liberty of the Trade Unions, and imposed a levy on capital, the Socialist Party would proclaim its independence. The Congress also decided to send representatives to the next International at Geneva. The result of the San Remo Conference, however, had a steadying effect, and the much talked of crisis has, for a time at least,been averted.
92. French Anglophobe Propaganda.In the first half of April Belgian co-operation with the French in the occupied districts was supported practically by the entire Press, while on the other hand the attitude of England had much intensified anti-British feeling. This Anglophobe propaganda was attributed to French influence, through newspapers full of French news, obviously inspired from the Quai (1&apos;Orsay or other French official sources. The French ambassador is most active in the interests of his country and the French have given a large number of decorations to Belgian sub-jects. Cinemas in Belgium are almost all in French hands, and give the French point of view. Topical films show current events in France only. Anti-British feeling is, of course, largely due to the adverse exchange. The Belgians are sore because they say that commercial competition on their part against Britain is impossible. When business becomes more normal this ill-feeling should grow weaker.3. Economic.Unrest in Belgium is solely due to the high cost of living, and the frequent strikes have no other significance. During the Ruhr dis-turbances there was anxiety, which was not, however, shared in official circles, as to the possibility of a general industrial upheaval. A league of volunteers to ensure the maintenance of public and economic services in the event of a general strike was spoken of.4. Extremists.The Third International at Moscow decided in March to send money to Belgium via Holland.Armand Lebrun, editor of a Communist newspaper, has been sentenced to one year&apos;s imprisonment, with costs, for advocating revolution in sympathy with the Bolsheviks. This is likely to have a salutary effect on other Belgian revolutionaries. The ease is the first of its kind, but will probably not be the last.On April 18th a military procession in Brussels in honour of citizens who fought in the war evoked the greatest enthusiasm, especially in working class districts.In spite of appeals issued by Extremists the 1st of May was not marked by any special Labour disturbances.italy. The Official View.An official dementi appeared in the *&apos; Stefan! &quot; of April 10th, concerning what the Italian authorities describe as the false and misleading information circulated abroad as to the internal condition of the country. This communication states that the truth regarding the disturbances at San Giovanni in Persicato (Decima) near Bologna, is that during a public meeting held in the open the police were com-pelled to use their arms, owing to the violence of some of the demon-strators, of whom unfortunately seven were killed. When the news of this event spread, a general strike was proclaimed at Bologna, Florence, Piacenza, Leghorn and Modena, at which latter place three clemon-strators were killed. The local railway organisations took part in the strike, but the attempt to extend the strike throughout Italy failed. The announcement ends with the glowing account of the economic recovery of Italy.
2. The Turin Strike.The general strike in Turin, which lasted from April 14th to 26th, may be considered a defeat for the extremists owing to the failure of the rest of Italy to join in sympathy. The point at issue was the composition of the Works Commissions, which the anarchists and advanced socialists desire to transform into Soviet Works Councils. Where it was limited by carefully thought out regulations, the regime of the Internal Commissions was gradually getting into working order, but subversive minorities are now trying to amend these regulations so as to give them a political character.3. New Extremist Tactics.The extremists have lately adopted new obstructive tactics to prevent the movement of troops or police to strike areas. The railway-men have refused to allow trains containing troops to move and sailors and dockers arc adopting a similar attitude. The Government took no measures to insist on the movement of troops by rail, and may therefore be considered to have yielded to the strikers on this point, a weakness which is reported to have brought them into some contempt. Comm. De Come, head of the State Railways, characterised a srtike of the kind at Turin as purely political, and indeed revolutionary. He said he had had his hands tied by the Government, who had issued strict orders that no measures were to be taken against the railwaymen until after the conference at San Remo. This he considered a mere excuse for procrastination. Prince von Buelow, who is in Rome in a semi-official capacity, is reported on good authority to have been exercising an influence on the Italian Government.On the whole the 1st of May in Italy passed off quietly, though in riots at Turin and Pola a few persons were killed and wounded.4. Trade with Soviet Russia.The experience of the Italian negotiators sent to Copenhagen to arrange the resumption of trade with Soviet Russia appears to have ben as depressing as that of our own. The Italians sent two representatives-sentatives in March to Copenhagen to negotiate with Litvinoff, one a Socialist Deputy, Bombacci, and the other a naturalised Italian of Russian origin named Kobolinski. Kobolinski&apos;s endeavours to obtain the recall of his co-clclegate who, in the name of the Italian Co-operatives, signed a convention with Litvinoff for the exchange of commodities through the Co-operative Societies of the two countries, may be inferred to signify what he thought of the value to Italy of the proceedings. It was indeed reported at the time as unlikely that this Convention would be recognised by the Italian Co-operative Societies. Bombacci is said to have returned to Italy very subdued, silent, and uncommunicative.5. The Army.The opinion of diverse Italian soldiers has been taken regarding the situation in Italy. All were agreed that revolution would never get beyond talk,and thatwhen the danger became imminent the people would draw back. Though sick of serving, the troops, they said, could be relied on. Even disaffected men, if abused by the populace, whilev XX
on police duty, became so incensed that they were ready to murder everybody.&quot; The bulk of those under arms were peasants, and for that reason the more reliable.In April, nevertheless, a general strike was proclaimed in Venice, because an officer, losing his temper with a soldier, drew his revolver and shot him. That such a cause should have had such an effect was regarded as particularly interesting and significant.To placate the Socialists and effect economy, a drastic reduction of the Italian Army to 175,000 men, with a more than proportionate reduction of officers, was proposed in April.0. Italian Socialist Party.At a meeting of the National Council of the Italian Socialist Party which took place at Milan on April 19th, a resolution was passed in favour of continued adherence; to the; 3rd International. Many ex-tremists, however, including Serrati himself, were in favour of helping the sincere socialists once in the 2nd International in their attempt to form the so-called Reconstruction International. A motion for the institution of Soviets was defeated at a Socialist National Congress by 88,000 votes to 5,000. information was received lare in March that Malatesta, the Italian Anarchist, wanted to go to Egypt. Steps were taken to prevent the visa being granted.7. The Government.Signer Nitti&apos;s resignation was ostensibly due to the failure of Catholic support. It is believed, however, that the Cabinet were by no means certain of their position and deliberate^ rode for a fall. Whether the reconstructed Cabinet will be firmer in the saddle than its predecessor seems open to doubt.SPAIN.1. Communist Activities.The Committee of the Federation of Young Socialists led by Francisco Layret has proposed to a number of affiliated unions to form a .Spanish Communist Party with adherence to the Third Inter-national. Whether the Syndicates have found themselves able to support this Party does not yet appear. The Anarchist section opposes it and the Russian and German branches, in their expectancy of a general revolutionary movement in Latin countries before August, show it small favour.Rodrigo Siniamo, the leader of the Spanish Communist Party, is reported to be in Berlin. Boal, Buencasa and Bejerano connect Madrid with the Bolshevik element in Barcelona, while Francisco Correno, the head of the Syndicalist group in Algeciras, acts as an intermediary for foreign Bolshevist correspondence.When Buencasa was reported in April to be leaving Barcelona to organise the revolutionary movement (which will take place, not, as originally intended, in May, but in June or July) he was to meet English and French agents at Bilbao. Money is reported to reach the syndicates-calists principally from Russia, but South America, the United States and France also contribute. Spain will be represented on the Labour Commission to Russia by Fernando de Los Rios, a moderate Socialist.
2. German Intrigue.The return in March of certain well-known Germans to Barcelona much increased the activity of the Syndicalists, and left no doubt that the German element was behind the extremists . A secret German office was opened in April at Barcelona (60, Calle Barmes) when; meetings attended by members of the new German Consulate General and by the war time agents of Ruggerberg and von Roland were and arc held nightly. The attacks on employers, bomb-throwing and violent disorder in Barcelona are reported to be driving trade to other parts of Spain.Marshal JoiTre&apos;s visit to Barcelona was made the occasion of a demonstration for the independence of Catalonia, and the collisions which occurred were, unpleasantly enough, between the troops on the one hand and the police, with the crowd, on the other.3. Industrial Unrest.The Railwaymen have gradually returned to work, but little progress has been mack; towards a national settlement of the railway problem. There is distinct unrest amongst the troops, though till the middle of April it was only betrayed in Saragossa and Pamplona. The very existence, however, of the Juntas de Defensa and the attempted formation of a Sergeants&apos; Junta show that the army is not well in hand. A general strike was declared in Saragossa on April 27th as a protest against the arrest of certain Syndicalist leaders implicated in the recent bomb outrages. May Day in Spain as a whole passed off fairly quietly.The Budget was passed on April 27th and on the fohWing day the King accepted from the Prime Minister, Senor Allende Salazar, the resignation of the Cabinet. Senor Dato&apos;s new Liberal Conservative Cabinet appears to have been fairly well received.PORTUGAL.1- The Government.The firmness of Batista, the Prime Minister, in suppressing revolu-tionary disturbances has won him the respect even of the Monarchists, who now declare that they will sacrifice party interests to the good of their country under a strong Government. Batista has arrested many extremists and now proposes to deport to Portuguese Africa the ring-leaders in the recent bomb outrages and other disturbances.The Government has taken steps to improve the police of Lisbon. The town is now guarded by 500 Infantry patrols and 200 mounted patrols of the Republican Guard.The Government has also introduced a Bill by which persons making murderous attempts or interfering with public order will be tried and deported without the lengthy formalities hitherto in force.Since Portugal became a Republic in 1910 no less than 36(5 persons have held office, including 27 Prime Ministers and 41 Ministers for Foreign Affairs.2. Newspapers of the Left.The &quot; Batalha &quot; which is supposed to be the official organ of the General Confederation of Labour in Portugal was suspended on the 6th of April, 1920, on the charge of inciting to strike and publishing
revolutionary propaganda. More violent even in tone is the &quot; Ban-deira Vermalha &quot; published under the direction of Ribeiro of the Labour Confederation. This paper is avowedly the organ of the Bolsheviks in Portugal, and gets its funds from Lenin via Switzerland and Spain, as well as from secret contributions within the country by Soverino and Antonio Maria da Silva, the same who held the post of Prime Minister for a period of 24 hours during the Cabinet crisis in February, and was formerly Commander-in-Chief of the Republican Guard.Great preparations made in Portugal for the celebration of May 1st melted into nothing in the drenching rain a never-failing remedy for civil disorders.2. SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES. NORWAY.i. Trade and other Relations with Soviet Russia.In Norwegian Labour circles it was believed in April that the Government was inclining towards the resumption of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Government. Their attitude in the case of the &quot; Solovei Budimirovitch,&quot; which was ice-bound in the Kara Sea, and their official requests to the Soviet Government to help them in a search for Tessem and Knudscn,two lost members of the Amundsen expedition, are cited as indications of this tendency, which is attributed to Socialist pressure, fear of revolution, and economic neccessities. The Norwegian Governments attitude is also largely influenced by the trend of affairs in Sweden, with which in this regard it is reliably &apos; reported to be acting in concert.Recent information from Christiania indicates that the Norwegian Delegation which negotiated Avith Krassin has transmitted to the Foreign Office the broad lines of the Bolsheviks&apos; economic projects for Northern Russia and Norway. The Soviet Government on its part intends to enlarge and make free the port of Murmansk, to double the Murmansk-Petrograd railway line, and to exploit the forests of the Governments of Archangel, Olenetz, Vologda and Perm. It offers the Norwegian capitalists participation in all these enterprises, especi-ally in the forest concessions, and guarantees the labour for them. Krassin is trying to induce the Norwegians, as their part of the scheme, to enlarge the ports of Tromsoe and Varcloe, which are to receive the goods and timber sent via Murmansk.Norwegian fisheries have decided, at their own risk, to enter into relations with the Bolsheviks, and sent them 400,000 tons of salted fish. Two ships have been chartered to bring the latter to Petrograd. Norway hopes to get flax in exchange, presumably from the small stocks reported to be available near Petrograd.2. Socialists and Extremists.International negotiations are taking place at the present moment between Communist leaders in the various European countries with the object of arranging a Communist Congress to be held at Christianiaabout the end of June.The delegates of this Congress hope to obtain the necessary Nor-wegian visa under some pretext or other, and delegates from the following countries will meet England, France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Netherlands, Scandinavian countries and Russia.
Some of the members of the Congress intend proceeding to Moscow from Christiania after the Congress.The Russians intend proceeding to Norway to attend this confer-ence via Vardo.  Zinovielf is taking a leading part.Endeavours are being made to form an International Revolutionary Union, for which purpose a preliminary conference will probably also be organised at Christiania.The Russian, Sohliapnikoff, has arrived at Stockholm from Moscow with this object in view, and will continue his journey to England and France.The National Socialists&apos; meeting in April derives interest from the fact that the; opposing revolutionary and parliamentary groups were all determined to oppose their respective views and programmes upon Norwegian labour. The agenda included in the establishment of Work-shop Councils, the socialisation of industry, the control of strike subsidies by national organisations, and the resumption of unrestricted intercourse with Soviet Russia. On the whole it seemed probable that, even if successful, the extremists would not be able to enforce more than workshop committees. Much was said to depend on events abroad, especially in Sweden and Denmark, as well as the attitude towards Soviet Russia of Great Britain.At a recent meeting early in April of the Central Committee of the Labour Party it was decided to take financial control of all Socialist press and printing undertakings in Norway. This idea is supported by the extremist organs &quot; Klassekampen &quot; and &quot; Revolt.&quot; The forma-tion of an amalgamated Press and Editing Company, comprising Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark was also discussed.3. Labour.At the recent International Transport Workers&apos; Congress held at Christiania (See Report No. 18) a general strike of transport workers throughout Scandinavia was discussed. No date for it was, however, fixed. The Russian delegates to the Congress signed an undertaking not. to participate in any political meetings in Norway without the consent of the Norwegian Authorities. When one of them abused his privileges, the Ministry of Justice asked them all to leave the country.The May Day demonstrations were uneventful. There were some violent speeches which, however, barely aroused interest, let alone enthusiasm. Members of the British Delegation in transit through Christiania took part and spoke from one of the platforms.The Bolsheviks have offered Norway six million roubles in kroner for concessions of coal on Bear Island. The Soviet Authorities attach the greatest importance to the success of this deal, which was to be carried out through the intermediary of a Norwegian.SWEDEN.1. Political.The present Swedish Government is doing its utmost to consolidate the Social Democratic Party as a bastion against the extreme Socialists. Should it succeed in thus fixing a gulf between the two Parties it hopes that the Right Socialists will gain many votes, both from the Liberal Bourgeoisie to its Right, which will now see the need of far-reaching social concessions, and from the not quite out and out extremists. The Government hope thus to obtain a really useful majority and to this end they are bringing before the present Riksdag bills for a diversity
of reforms. Should they fail to carry the municipal taxation bill, the Extremists will doubtless draw the moral of the uselessness of political adjustments, and even of political action as a whole.In the Governments favour and against the Extremists are the fact that the working classes have never been better fed or clothed than now, and the warning of events in Germany and Russia ; even Left Socialists often say that Branting&apos;s Ministry is just as good as the last and probably the; right one for the situation.&quot; Politiken,&quot; the organ of the Extremists, and their main weapon against the Government, seems to be financially in a bad way. In a recent article the editor compares his paper to a village donkey : while everybody thought his neighbour was feeding it, the donkey died.2, Trade Relations with Soviet Russia.At a meeting of the heft Wing Socialists late in March it was decided to demand the immediate resumption of unrestricted intercourse with Soviet Russia. A Delegation of Industrial magnates, on the other hand, visited the Foreign Minister soon after to discuss the same question, and it was then agreed that no business could be done with Russia until all claims for property destroyed, or confiscated has been settled.Though negotiations between the Government and the Krassin Delegation apparently broke down, at first on the questions of free trading and transport facilities, the Swedes sent a delegate to Copen-hagen to watch negotiations between the Russian Centro-soyus and trade delegations of other powers. This delegate, Consul Ertzstrom, was soon negotiating with Krassin on behalf of the Swedish Industrials and has quite lately been urging the Swedish Government to authorise the Soviet Government to open an official commercial agency in Stock-holm. Ertzstrom believes that the Danes are benefiting largely by the present situation and that it is important that the Swedes should Avork preferably in concert Avith Danish and Norwegian capitalists  to get into business relations Avith Russia. Towards the end of April a first commercial contract between a Swedish firm and the Soviet Government was reported. The firm, Avhich has a factory in Stockholm, undertook to deliver agricultural and dairy machinery to the total value of six million crowns, against payment in gold, the goods to be shipped via Reval. A transport bearing ten million roubles in gold from Reval, in payment for the Soviet Covernmenfs first order, was expected in Stockholm early this month.It is credibly reported that Sweden and the U.S.A. as creditor countries, Avere more than doubtful about accepting gold from the Bolsheviks in payment for goods sold to them, since the flooding of the gold markets in both countries might cause a rise in the paper crdit currency so serious that the stability of the whole International exchange system might be endangered.3. Extremists.Arrangements for the Communist Congress at Christiania (vide NorAvay : Socialists and Extremists) are being made at Stockholm, Everything is being arranged from Stockholm : Bolshevik funds are also being controlled from there. They consist of jewellery, pearls, etc., Avhich are converted into money. A sum of 50,000 kronen has already been sent to Holland, and attempts are being made to send a sum to France as soon as this can be arranged without any risk.
Arrangements for several transmissions of money have been made.Frederick Strom is, it is believed, in charge of these arrangements in Stockholm. There is a courier service between him and Russia, and through him with Litvinoff (Copenhagen), Rutgers (Holland), Herzog (Switzerland), Loriot and Monatte (France), Kopp (Germany).At present there are three courier services per week between Stockholm and Moscow. Letters and printed matter sent from Holland through ibis channel reach Moscow in 9 days.During the Ruhr insurrection many Swedish workmen are reported to have hoped that the German Reds would not succeed, since if they had it would be difficult to keep Bolshevism out of Sweden.A secret conference to be held at Stockholm, presumably in May, was to promote co-operation between the Extremists in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland and to discuss, among other questions, the formation of a Bureau of the Third International for Scandinavian countries.At an Extremist meeting at Stockholm the Trades Union Propa-ganda League was formed and resolutions passed urging the organisa-tion of trade unions on class principles and socialisation of any and every enas of industry, banks, etc. This programme is reported not absolutely to represent the views of responsible Labour Leaders in Sweden. ,  .4. Workers&apos; Emigration to Soviet Russia.Litvinoff was strongly opposed to the proposed emigration of skilled Swedish workmen to Russia. He considered that if they saw the real conditions in that country their visit would do real injury to the Bolshevik cause. The lack of raw materials in Russia offered Swedish workers only the barest prospects of work, and their presence would only aggravate the already disastrous situation in Sweden in districts to which they were sent.Branting and Palmstierna, the Swedish Ministers for Foreign Affairs for these very reasons would not let the matter drop, and decided to send a labour deputation of the Young Socialist Party (i.e. non-Bolsheviks) to study economic conditions in Russia. The deputation had the full confidence of the Swedish workmen. Two of its members, Hellberg and Grimlund, therefore went to Copenhagen to see Litvinoff, who, unable to refuse them admittance, rather tremulously decided that the delegation of six should be met at Murmansk and led about, as far as possible, blindfolded. His refusal to admit skilled labour when Russia is calling out for it must be regarded as highly significant.Politiken has started a campaign against America and its treatment of workers, hoping to dissuade people from going to the United States and instead, to incline them towards Russia. Most Swedish labourers, however, are cautiously inclined to await the result of the Commission of Investigation.5. Industrial Unrest.The conflict in the building trade continues with small hope of concessions from either side. Last year a proprietor in one of the Villa suburbs contracted for some building. The price was fixed and the work completed and paid for. In February this year the workmen came clown upon this gentleman for 3,000 kr. more for walking time and as compensation for the high cost of living. He referred them to the final written receipt.  The men replied &quot; We don&apos;t care for any
paper &quot; and threatened to have him boycotted. The local Syndicalist organisation eventually imposed a compromise and for 1,500 kr. the employer was left alone. This is said not to be a solitary case. Such action by Syndicalists is not uncommon in Sweden, even in other trades.6. Miscellaneous.Mr. Branting was attacked by the Extreme Socialists for refusing to admit Litvinoff into Sweden. He replied that he did not see why Sweden should deal with Litvinoff, who had been rejected by the British Authorities and attributed the desire of the Extremists to obtain his entry into the country to ulterior motives of a revolutionary nature.The British Labour Delegation, on their way to Russia, arrived at Stockholm from Christiania on the morning of May 2nd. Mr. Ben Turner and Dr. Guest visited the Legation. In reply to the British Ministers wish that they might obtain really reliable information in Russia and avoid being shown only such conditions as their guides wished them to see, Mr. Turner said that they were bent on getting genuine information and that he thought it would be difficult to hood-wink Britishers when they really wanted to get at the truth. Mr. Turner knows no Russian, and if the wireless accounts of his speeches are accurate, he has been hoodwinked already.DENMARK.1. The Elections.The Danish elections resulted in a victory for the Liberals, who gained everywhere, in a check to the Socialists, who had hoped to become the largest individual party, and in disaster for the Radicals, who have everywhere lost.2. Trade Relations with Soviet Russia.Allegations by the Copenhagen correspondent of the &quot; Hamburger Fremdenblatt &quot; regarding seditious activities by Litvinoff during the political crisis in Denmark last month are being investigated by the Danish authorities. Should the charges be substantiated, warning will first be given to Danes still in Russia and Litvinoff will shortly there-after be expelled from Denmark.The Commission of the Danish Government is believed to have urged an agreement with the Krassin Delegation, by which all goods purchased in Russia by Danes before the Russian Revolution shall be returned to their rightful owners, and permission for their export from Russia given, in default of which there value in gold must be paid. In return the Danes say that they will export to Russia 19 million kr worth of seeds ; 20 million kr. worth of agricultural machinery and 1200 railway wagons. In the negotiations the Danes seem to have laid stress on the apparent failure of the Soviet negotiations with the Allied Powers and on the need for Russia, if it wanted to remain in Europe at all, of an agreement with Denmark.The establishment of a clearing house in Denmark to facilitate commercial exchange with Soviet Russia is viewed with scepticism in commercial circles in Copenhagen.r
3. Labout Unrest.The Dockers&apos; strike at Copenhagen continues. Disturbances have occurred between Syndicalists and the police. Members of various Copenhagen firms have begun themselves to unload their goods from vessels in the Harbours. The &quot; Helpers of the Community,&quot; an organisation recently formed in Denmark to supply the Government with the services of voluntary workers in case of stoppage of essential industries, has been at work.On the 1st of May a few meetings were held but there were no disturbances or demonstrations.3. CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.HOLLAND.I. Relations with Soviet Russia.The Dutch Government intend to await the result of the investiga-tion by the League of Nations before deciding to renew relations with Soviet Russia.2. The Transport Strike.There was evidence of a close connection between the; German Reds operating in the Ruhr districts and Communists in Holland, where the Extreme Labour Unions and Communist Party were in close touch.In the earlier stages of the Transport strike the Dutch Transport Workers&apos; Federation refused to touch supplies which were waiting at Rotterdam for transport to Essen. When, however, the Red Army gained the upper hand in the Ruhr, their attitude completely changed, and they did their utmost to get the supplies through.During a debate late in March on the export of food stuffs to dis-tricts occupied by the Red Army, Troelstra supported the Dutch Foreign Minister against Wynkoop. The Dutch took precautions on the Eastern frontier against possible Red influence and even mobilised some of the Landsturm.The Central Union of Transport Workers in Holland, at the request of the Delegation of German Transport Workers, agreed early in April to transport foodstuffs to Germany and Central Europe on condition that the work should be carried out under the direction of the Union and the men paid 8 florins a day.Towards the end of the month the strike, which began on February 14th, came to an end, the dockers deciding by ballot to resume work on April 26th. The workers&apos; demand of 8 florins (13. 4d.) a day instead of 7 florins (11s. 8d.) offered by the Wages Council was acceded to. The upshot was a defeat for the workers and depletion of the Union&apos;s funds. Moreover the revelations at the; outbreak of the strike of the connection of certain of its leaders with Communists and Bol-sheviks brought clearly before the men the fact that their own material welfare was being used as a bait to entangle- them in a political move-ment.As regards the refusal to handle Dutch cargoes in foreign ports there was, indeed, some display of International solidarity during the strike, but the supply of funds from abroad broke down at the crucial moment. Some ieaclers of foreign Transport Workers&apos; Organisations made small donations, but direct appeals to the workmen themselves
wore unprofitable. Robert Williams&apos; efforts to obtain funds from the British dockers met with poor success.Among the rank and file of the Dutch workers a desire to form a single union to work for the improvement of material conditions for the workers, regardless of political purposes, is said to be common,3. The Third International Bureau.The Soviet Authorities are reported to be dissatisfied with the Berlin Bureau, which is under the direction of James Reich, and is thought to have gone too far in the way of embezzlement. For some time past considerable jealousy has existed between the James Reich organisation and the Amsterdam Bureau under Wynkoop and Mrs. Roland Hoist. Early this month the; Bolsheviks reported by wireless that the mandate of the Amsterdam Bureau had been annulled and its functions transferred to James Reich&apos;s Berlin office. This was regarded at the time as bluff to divert attention from Wynkoop and his associates. It now appears, however, that the dissolution of the Third International Bureau at Amsterdam has really taken place, Lenin arguing that as Holland and England were not yet ripe for Bolshevik revolution, no more money could be sent to Amsterdam for propaganda, and that those capitalist countries would, in future, be attacked by intense propaganda in their colonies.4. Extremists.At a recent conference of the Dutch Labour Secretariat it was agreed that no independent revolution could be organised in Holland, since the country was politically and economically dependent upon surrounding states. The Dutch proletariat must therefore be economi-cally organised to do its share when the real revolution breaks out in the large countries.The Union of Bolshevik Intellectuals in Holland is at present engaged in instructing the more intelligent classes of workmen to take over the management of factories etc., in the event of a revolution.A Union of Religious Communists is reported to have been formed under the leadership of A. R. de Jong. It pursues a new religious world culture, opposed to force of arms but favouring all tendencies to Communism.   Its organ will be entitled &quot; The Free Communist.&quot;The Secretary of the Dutch Federation of Esperantists is suspected of having Bolshevik sympathies. It is noteworthy that Esperanto is now taught to all Russian Soviet schools.5. Counter-Bolshevik Organisations.Events during the occupation of the Ruhr basin by the Red Army have been not only a strong deterrent to advocates of Bolshevism in Holland, but a proof of the small hold Communism really has upon the working classes in that country. The Dutch army and police were unshaken by the conflagration over the Border and there were no defections to speak of from the Volunteer Lanclsturm sent to guard the frontier.The Volunteer Intelligence section of the Burgerwacht appears well organised and has earned the respect of the Dutch police. It has branches throughout the country, especially in the frontier towns, and can supply reliable information regarding the activity of Com-munists, and especially of revolutionary Socialist Intellecruals.C 2
An important Bill against revolutionary agitation was introduced into the Dutch Chamber in April, This Bill makes it an offence to have relations with foreign institutions or persons preparing, furthering, or creating revolution ; to import or possess any object or funds known or suspected to have a revolutionary purpose ; or to utter in public, verbal or written incitement to disobedience of a lawful order, or violent opposition to public order. Punishments under the Act run from five years&apos; imprisonment to fines. Penalties arc; affixed to attacks upon the form of government or against the Law of Succession to the throne. This legislation is&quot;of course being hotly opposed by the extremists, notably by the Federation of Social Anarchists.(i. Unrest in the Dutch East Indies,Uneasiness due to Nationalist and social unrest is reported from Java, where natives arc; getting out of hand and forming societies which advocate independence arid attack tin; capitalists. The planters, who fear an Indian rising, complain of lack of protection from the Government and of the weakness of the alleged pro-German Governor. Both Army and Navy are considered unreliable. The unrest is put down to Japanese intrigue. Japan as a power is greatly feared, since; she is known to have made preparations to occupy the Dutch East Indies if Holland had made a move during the war to join the Central Powers. Her peaceful penetration, on the other hand, which takes the form of buying up sugar interests and commercial enterprises of other kinds, is reported to be not unwelcome,, though the Dutch like the British better.GERMANY.It was indicated in the last two reports that there were serious grounds for believing that the Commissariats for Military and Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Republic on the one hand, and on the other the Cerman Reactionaries, into whose embrace the German Government had been flung by the recrudescence of Spartacism in the Ruhr District, were at least weighing the chances of a military combina-tion, which after extinguishing Poland and Roumania would turn and fling its weight, first upon the occupied territories and then upon France.During the past month evidence has been accumulating which, though it does not absolutely prove the Soviet Government itself to be a party to the plan, shows, at any rate, that it very carefully and exhaustively weighed its possibilities, and went so far as to give pledges of its adhesion to.the other parties in the bargain. Opportunism as regards means is absolute in the Russian Commissariat of Foreign Affairs and does not exclude an alliance with opposites as a step in the dictatorship of the proletariat. Were Soviet Russia to be rid of her economic disasters, the Germano-Hungarian monarchists would find that the catspaw has claws. The tangle of affairs in Russia is their opportunity The Soviet Authorities require German and Russian Monarchist help for the reorganisation of their armies and of their industries, a fact which the reactionaries and Right Socialists of Ger-many and in Central Europe believe can be made instrumental to their several purposes.The evidence, moreover, shows&apos; that the contagious frenzy of Nationalist reaction is spreading and that the plans of the German Reaction now include Hungary, Austria, Italy and Turkey, all of
which its leaders believe can be brought to participate in varying degrees in a serious reactionary military&apos; movement to mop up the humiliation and disabilities which are the legacy of their failure in war.1. The Bolshevist Standpoint.Viewed from the Bolshevist standpoint the matter is in substance entirely different, but, in structure, up to a point, the same. Lenin has no thought for humanity, no shrinking from the disasters with which his policy may afflict it in the intermediate stage. To him, leaning upon the rim of the world, wars and pestilences, should they come, merely usher in a new age. Compared with the establishment of the regime of Individual Liberty and Capitalism they are not disastrous, but transitory wisps of cloud which will clear. Ho is not unwilling that they should come, for they arc among the former things that must pass away. They are instrumental merely, to be taken up and laid down like an artificers tools.Lenin and his Commissariat of Military Affairs are, therefore, all for the international organisation of military forces which, in case of need, would support any revolutionary movement inspired by the dictatorship of the proletariat which required it. Sporadic movements without international connection they regard as doomed to failure. Special consideration of military factors is therefore required, and upon the relations between Russia and Germany the future organisation of the world-wide Communist Revolution, supported by military force, principally depends.The Soviet Government are therefore willing to go part of the way with European Reactionaries and Monarchists in that they wish to establish a League of Nations for purposes of war. A document recently passed by the French to the British Military Mission in Paris sets their policy in a very clear light. The French Authorities attach particular importance to this document, which is supposed to have been despatched from Moscow by Flatten, the Swiss ex-deputy who became a Commissar in the Soviet Government, to a Swiss correspon-dent. Speaking of the alliance between Russia and Germany this document says that the Soviet Governments real desire is of course an alliance with the German Soviet Government.&quot; But, meanwhile, we have obtained from the present German &quot; Government the assurance that a secret military alliance is &quot; possible between the two countries, an alliance for the purpose &quot; of thwarting the manoeuvres of the rulers of the capitalist&quot; Entente.....&quot; This alliance will be founded upon solid economic bases, &quot; that is, whilst looking forward to the common employment of &quot; the military forces of the two countries, we shall endeavour il meanwhile to support each other by reciprocal commercial &quot; dealings which can but strengthen a military alliance.   .   .   .&quot; The German military forces which could, in case of necessity, . &quot; operate outside Germany, have an approximate strength of &quot; (500,000 men. The strength fixed by the Treaty of Versailles &quot;does not affect the question . . . Our (Russian) military &quot; forces also able to operate outside the country for the purpose &quot; of maintaining any revolutionary movement in Western Europe, &quot; may be estimated at one million men. But we must take into &quot; account the fact that we should, in this case, require the indus-&quot; trial support of Germany for equipping and arming these troops,
&quot; just as \vc have promised help in food supplies and agricul-&quot;ture  .   .   .&quot; This military alliance would naturally be subsidiary to a &quot; revolutionary movement in Poland, removing the fictitious &quot; barrier created by the Entente between Germany and Russia.&quot; In Hungary our activities will be enabled, within a certain &quot; period, to re-establish a Communist Government.   Austria is &quot; considered as a military satellite of Germany.   .   .   .  Jugo-&quot; Slavia depends in a military sense upon Italy, which country &quot; we have gained over.&quot; On the question of the lines on which an alliance between Soviet Russia and Germany would be able to support revolutionary action breaking out in a country of the Capitalist Entente, the formulators of the scheme divide such countries into two categories, (a) those like France and England which, shaken, impoverished and indebted by the war, are considered as possible spheres of action, (b) those like the United States and Japan, countries unshaken and with a great concentration of capital.As regards (a): In England the Soviet Government seems to rely on syndicalist and social forces undertaking revolutionary and direct action, which the Bourgeois Government will be powerless to meet with force of arms ; the implication being that, since the British fleet would &quot; perhaps &quot; prevent the landing in England of a foreign military force, England must cure herself. Altogether the document does not seem very hopeful about England.France, on the other hand, the &quot; centre of capitalist reaction,&quot; would suppress a workmen&apos;s revolution with great bloodshed, when the German Russian military alliance would bo able to intervene actively.&quot; We must give strong financial support to the intelligence &quot; and propaganda services established in France.   ...   At &quot; present we may count on about twenty French regiments   . .. &quot; the remainder of the French Army is fiercely reactionary, and &quot; that is a serious danger.&quot; It will thus be necessary to maintain in France an intense &quot; anti-militarist propaganda amongst young men in order that &quot; in time, the military forces upon which the bourgeoisie could &quot; now depend may be   .   .   .   disintegrated.  Defenders of the &quot; rights of the proletariat must understand that the keystone of &quot; the world-wide capitalist organisation is in France   ...   On &quot; the day when we can destroy even relatively, the French military &quot; forces in the service of a capitalist government, the world-wide &quot; revolution will be at hand.&quot; As regards (b) :    America and Japan, now the two capitalist countries par excellence, it will be necessary to prevent the armed intervention between these two countries in any action against the countries under (a).   A rational scheme of sabotage, preventive in purpose, will therefore be begun in these countries at the inception of the military phase of the world-wide revolution.On the whole, &quot; the resumption of commercial relations with &quot; these countries is favourable to the development of our revolu-&quot; tionary action, and we shall be able to take that into account &quot; in the events now preparing in Europe.&quot;2. Corresponding Policy ol the German Reactionaries.The attitude and policy of the German reactionaries is described
2723by an excellent report which has reached us from an exceptionally intimate and reliable source and which is here incorporated en bloc. The scope and purpose of the scheme of the German and Central European Reactionaries may be compared with the plan of the Russian Commissariat already described. It seems not impossible that out of the identity of the interesst up to a certain point of the two parties, a common policy disastrous to the peace and reconstruction of exhausted Europe; may arise.&apos;&apos; Plans for New Reactionary Coup.&quot; The German Reactionaries profess to regard the late &apos; Putsch&apos; &quot;as a &apos; ballon d&apos;essai,&apos; and, if we credit a report from what is &quot; believed to be an exceptionally good source, far from being &quot; discouraged by 11 s result, they arc plotting for a new coup d&apos;ctat &quot; on a far larger scale, to take place in two or three months. &quot; This time the German Reactionaries are not to act alone, but .&quot; hope to secure the co-operation of Austria, Hungary, Turkey &quot; and tlx; Bolsheviks. Ludcndorff is said to be at the back of &quot; the movement; Noske is to take part in it and come into the &quot; open ; and von Kuhlmann, von Jagow and Zimmerman are &quot; working at the plans.&quot;The leaders of the German plot are in communication, through &quot;the agency of trustworthy conspirators, with their coadjutors &quot; in the other countries involved. The general character of the &quot; scheme; may he learnt from the plans which an emissary of the &quot; German Reactionaries laid before a meeting at Budapest on &quot; the 11th and 12th April. Among those present on this occasion &quot; were Count Apponyi, Baron trawlers, Count Andrassy, Baron Gjorfy, &quot; Graf Sandor, Tibor Haray, Vilnius Sebastiany, and the former &quot; Hungarian Minister to Mexico, who did a great deal of talking. &quot; We are not aware how his name is spelt, but it sounds like &quot; Cuniaire,&quot; Some time before the meeting of the 11th April, the German &quot; Monarchists had sent to the Monarchists at Budapest an offer &quot; of assistance from Lenin to make a concerted attack on the &quot; Roumanians, but to this offer the Germans had up to then &quot; received no satisfactory reply. They now, therefore, sent &quot; another emissary to explain matters more fully, and to bring &quot; back a definite yes or no.&quot; The emissary first of all explained that the German Monar-&quot; chists were not dissatisfied with the results of the last &apos; Putsch.&apos; &quot; They had gained very valuable information, and now knew &quot; pretty accurately what the Reds would do, and how far they &quot; would be able to react. They also knew where they stood with &quot; regard to the Entente. This knowledge would be invaluable, &quot; and, on the whole, matters appeared to be rather less difficult &quot; than they had expected.&quot; In the next place, the emissary promised that Noske, with &quot; all his following, Avould join the Monarchist party openly. The &quot; Monarchists would have at their disposal about 500,000 well-&quot; trained and thoroughly equipped men, on whom they could &quot; place absolute reliance. With this force, and with the co-opera-&quot;&apos; tion of their neighbours, the blow would be struck in two or &apos;* three months with every prospect of success. In the opinion &quot; of the German Monarchists, the emissary proceeded, Hungary &quot; should sign the Peace Treaty, and should, on various pretexts,
&quot; delay the negotiations for ratification for at least two or three &quot; months. Lenin had promised that during this time he would &quot; send his armies to over-run Roumania through Transylvania. &quot; Munitions would be sent to them through Raly. (Reports in confirmation of this have been received).&quot;After the &quot;Putsch&apos; had been successfully accomplished in &quot; Berlin, the Monarchists, in suppressing the resultant Bolshevik &quot; movement in Germany, would take and over-run the occupied &quot; territories on the Rhine. If the Turks, Germans, Hungarians &quot; and Austrians were then to attack their objectives simultaneous-&quot; ly, whilst the Bolsheviks invaded Poland and Roumania, then &quot; the Entente, who are believed to be even now almost impotent, &quot; would be taken by surprise;, and would be incapable of putting &quot; up any strong resistance. The Hungarians were also told that &quot; forces which arc now being mobilised in Austria, for the osten-&quot; sible purpose of attacking the Western provinces of Hungary &quot; would be ready to join in the general fight, when they realised &quot; that it freed them from certain clauses of the Peace Treaty. &quot; In fact the officers, though not perhaps the Government, know &quot; that they are destined for this purpose.&quot; The position of Admiral Horthy was freely discussed during &quot; the meeting. Those present were told that he would not oppose &quot; the project in any way. He is evidently considered to be weak &quot; and easily led, especially into a policy which he has been per-&quot; persuaded will benefit his country.&quot; During the second day of the meeting, Apponyi left for &quot; nearly an hour. While he was out of the room, someone said &quot; that it was very fortunate that the plan did not involve overt &quot; hostility to England, because many people were beginning to &quot; compare Hungary with Egypt, and had conceived the hope &quot; that, like Egypt, a peaceful Hungary under the British aegis &quot; would soon become wealthy and prosperous. These remarks &quot; occasioned a storm of prote t. The speaker was abused, and &quot; several persons indignantly demanded to know whether Hun-&quot; garian patriots would sell their land and their pride for English &quot; gold.&quot; It was finally decided at the meeting of the 12th that the &quot; Hungarian conspirators would accept the Berlin and Russian &quot; proposals, and act in accordance with them.&quot; In Austria, Graf Schoerborn and &apos; Staatssecreta &apos; Weis, &quot; (presumably Dr. Wcis, Under Secretary for Military Affairs) &quot; and a certain Major Trochanka von Kulmsieg are leaders of &quot; the conspiracy. Major Trochanka appears to be the most active &quot; among them. He is constantly in communication with the &quot; Emperor Charles, and it is to him that the Budapest meeting &quot; conveyed its approval of the Berlin proposals.&quot; We have no information as to what arrangements the German &quot; Reactionaries have been making with Turkey, but it is known &quot; that Major Trochanka acts as intermediary between the Turkish &quot; Nationalists and the Berlin Military party, and all Turkish &quot; couriers are received at his house. When it is necessary for &quot; any Hungarian, Turk or other Nationalist to go secretly to &quot; Berlin, Weis is then taken into confidence, and secures a diplo-&quot; matic courier passport.&quot; We have also no direct information as to the negotiations &quot; between the German Reactionaries and the Soviet Government, &quot; but it is noteworthy that there is always a certain number of
&quot; Russian officers in Budapest. Thus a short time ago a Baron &quot; Frieherr von Halm, who, although he speaks only German, calls &quot; himself a Russian and goes everywhere in Cossack uniform, &quot; arrived in Budapest with three Russians, among whom was a &apos;&quot; Prince Kasimir Biegitschiff, The three have left, but the Baron &quot; still remains. More recently a Colonel Seinrikoff from Pctrograd &quot; visited Vienna, and then came on to Budapest.&quot; Leading Hungarian Communists also appear to know well &quot; that Lenin, for his own far-seeing end, is at the moment support-&quot; ing the Reactionaries.&quot; The plans will remain in abeyance until after the elections &quot;for the National Assembly have; taken place, which should be &quot; about the 6th of dune.&quot; According to the Monarchists these elections will result in a &quot; complete victory for the &apos; Parties of the Right.&apos; It is claimed &quot; at present that the Conservatives will obtain the greatest number &quot; of seats, at the lowest estimate 90. The Independent Socialists &quot;will double or treble their present number of seats, but the &quot; combinations of the Right parties will undoubtedly have a large &quot;majority. The gain will of course be at the expense of the &quot; Majority Socialists.&quot; The idea is that after the Conservatives come to power &quot; through this general election, they will then by systematic &quot; organisation of provocation and agitation engineer an enormous &quot; Spartacist rising in the Ruhr district. This future Spartacist &quot; revolt will be something on a far larger scale than anything &quot; which has happened up to the present. I was told that the &quot; Monarchist organisation and plans for the pro vocation of this &quot; new Spartacist revolt were; brilliant, and also those for the &quot; attacking of the Entente after the Spartacists have been sup-&quot; pressed.&quot; In the German military espionage organisation they claim &quot; that they have not only trustworthy information, but ample &quot; proof, that the Entente have not a quarter of the military &quot; resources now at their disposal which the Germans have. They &quot; are under the impression that the Entente will not be afraid to &quot; fight again, but if she fights they feel sure of a German victory &quot; and their own Peace Terms.&quot;&quot;The present position in Poland and Ukrainiais not considered &quot; as sufficiently permanent to effect the recent arrangements&apos; &quot; made with the Hungarians and Turks because Petlura has no &quot; real following in Ukrainia, Amongst the Ukrainians Petlura&apos;s &quot; alliance with Pilsudski is considered a flagrant act of treachery. &quot; All those who know the feeling in Ukrainia must be cognizant &quot; of the almost general hatred now felt towards the Poles.&quot;*&quot; That they hate perhaps equally the Bolshevik rule is no doubt &quot; true. , It will be remembered that the last time when Petlura &quot; was defeated in his attempt to obtain the power in Ukrainia, &quot; he had to escape to Poland, and the idea is that only by bringing &quot; the whole of Poland behind him, could he have dared to return. &quot;In the opinion of the German Militarists Petlura&apos;s and Pid-&quot; sudski&apos;s expedition is sure to meet with the same fate as Denikin&apos;s &quot; According to their information the situation in Ukrainia will* An regards the hostility of the country districts of the Ukraine to all intruders, whether Poles or Bolshevik-^, see April report, Part .11, article : &quot;The Situation in the Ukraine.&quot;
&quot; not last two months, as the Bolsheviks have tremendously &quot; strong forces commanded by some of the best German Staff &apos;&quot; Officers concentrated in the Caucasus and two to three monthsis the outside limit of the time it will take to get these troops &quot; across. Then the retreat will be as rapid as the advance, with &quot; this advantage, that the Russian forces will have a good pretextto carry out their earlier obligations to Berlin against Roumania &quot; for the assistance of Hungary.&quot;3. Reactionary GermanyWhile these reports deal with the; external policy of the Gentian reactionaries, the conclusions drawn from them arc, with a few excep-tions, confirmed by incidents and from sources both in the country itself and in adjoining countries where the same sort of intrigue appears to be active;, and also, what is more curious, from reports emanating from a Bolshevist milieu in a neutral country.A meeting (possibly that which sent the envoy to Budapest on April 11th) was held on Easter Monday at Koenigsberg by the Russian-German reactionaries. It was attended by all the leading-Russian reactionaries in Berlin, as also of a number of German bankers. Either at this or at a similar conference at Koenigsberg at a later elate it was decided that the; leaders of the counter-revolution in Germany were; (1) opposed to demobilising the Army ; (2) desirous of erecting a National fund to support a secret army ; (3) desirous to support the Russian reaction in Germany and abroad and maintain the agreement formerly made with Biskupski-Bermont.A report from Berlin dated April 13th gives the plans for the new reactionary coup as described by Herr Ledebour to a secret conference of the labour parties.   Led ebon r declared :&quot; The Counter Revolution disposes of considerable capital. Luden-ludendorff has worked out a military and peditical plan for a new coup (Veldt. &quot;Lucttwitz, Bischoff and Bauer will be the leaders of the &quot; operations in East Prussia, Silesia and Pom morn and General &quot; Wattcr in the centre.&quot; In South Germany, and specially in Bavaria, the leader will &quot; be General von Mehl.&quot; The direction of the counter-revolution is concentrated in the &quot; hands of the secret General Staff.&apos;f There has never been a question of reducing the &quot; Reich-&quot; swehr,&quot; on the contrary it grows every day.&quot; The peasants have had orders not to bring their goods to the &quot; markets but to put them aside, awaiting the given signal. The &quot; Counter-Revolutionarics have decided to employ part of their &quot; funds in buying these products, they will be stored for the &apos;: supply of the army.&quot; Numerous detachments which are being dissolved hide their &quot; arms and ammunition, which are fetched during the night by &quot; men who transport them to the interior of the country.&quot; It is interesting in this connection to note that labour leaders of the Hamburg Opposition Party, which is working for war with the Entente, have recently been in secret conference with officers at the Reichswehr Ministerium af Berlin.4. The Aftermath o  the Putsch.In Germany in fact the Putsch has not cleared the political atmo-sphere.   The parties of the Right are impenitent, describe it merely
as premature, and speak of Kapp as ludendorff&apos;s &quot; Probekaninchen &quot;  a mere &quot; cony for vivisection,&quot; Dr. Harnisch, an eminent journalist of the party, points out that the government, in spite of ludendorff&apos;s known share in the Putsch, has not ventured to impeach him and draws the pardonable conclusion that it feels itself too weak to do so.* The truth is that the Socialist Government can keep in power only with the permission of the reactionaries. It has not been able to disarm the Marine-Brigade, the Baltihm and other counter-revolutionary troops, or to get hold of the; leaders against whom it has issued warrants. The Government are still, in the words of i 1 err Gessler, the Eeichswehr-minister, &quot; considering ways and means of doing if.&quot; Countcr-rovolu-tionary forces have again been assembled in Pomerania and the adherence to them of Zeitfreiwillige and students appears to be as ardent as ever. The Marine Brigade Ehrhardt was at the Munsterlagcr. near Hanover, at the end of April, and Luettwitz, Bischoff, and the Baltikum troops in Pomerania seemed then only to be waiting for the moment to attempt a blow.The Kapp affair, in fact, did not reveal anything like the depth of the movement. Officers of the; &quot; secret army &quot; then received the option of remaining quietly at their posts in the; Eeichswchr, if they did not want to be compromised. The demobilised troops are now told not to forget that, though, workmen, they are soldiers still. Those ostensibly employed on agricultural Avork on the; estates of the Pomeranian Junkers, are said to be excellently fed, and to receive 14 marks a day, 8 paid by the Agricultural League and 6 by the Keichswehr. The &quot; workman &quot; camouflage is carefully maintained. A large number of the Baltic troops arc now reported in the Eeichswehr.5. General Conclusions.To try to summarise what may happen after the German elections, when it is probable that the Bight Wing of the independent Socialists will come into power, would be to look too far ahead. Meanwhile, information received generally tends to confirm the story of a plot to amalgamate the monarchist interests of the different countries, with a view to bringing German efficiency to bear upon the present chaos in the conquered lands. The one contradiction of importance is in respect of Bolshevik participation. &quot;A report from an almost invariably accurate informant in Copenhagen states that on April 10th  a day, that is, before the meeting at Budapest-Kopp, the Bolshevist representative in Berlin, arrived in Copenhagen in great fury because the reactionaries in Germany, despite a promise to the contrary by Radek, had now been refused military support by the Bolsheviks This, taken at its face value, may signify either a reference to the lack of Bolshevik participation in the Putsch, or a change of policy, momentary or permanent, on the part of the Soviet Authorities. But, if true, it also indicates what their policy was, and what their entire opportunism as regards the means to their end. may make it again.* During the Putsch Ludenilorif himself is I bought, when he disappeared from Berlin, to have withdrawn to the forest home of his friend, Dr. Gcorg I leini, the Bavarian Bauern-Koenig,&quot; described as flic most- Bismarckinn in general character of present day Germans, a convinced Monarchist also, but of the constitutional kind. There, at any rate, in the end of April LmdendorfE received a representative of the Hearst papers and told him with a blunt diplomacy which almost made anything more persuasive look mean, how &quot; the minds of the most fervent Conservatives had adapted themselves to a, changed order of things and how French imperialism - was trying to foment trouble to justify aggressions.&quot;
Much would appear to depend on the success or failure of the Polish Offensive. The Poles have forestalled the impending Bolshevik-cum -Reactionary coup by a couple of months. They may have upset it altogether. On the other hand, it is possible that by over-running the Ukraine thay may not only arouse that Bonapartism in the Red Army which Radek so dreads, but may, by cutting off the only region in Russia which is rich both in coal and food supplies, divert Soviet-Russia from the policy of reconstruction for which the Soviet Regime is so unfitted that it must almost certainly fail, into paths of foreign aggression which would weld it to the Central European Reactionaries.One shrinks from the conclusion ; but Lenin&apos;s inhuman aloofness may have set the intricacies of the European situation in a true per-spective, and his calculation that he will have his way whether the peoples fight or refuse lo light, has an appearance of foresight which is both disquieting and sinister.SWITZERLAND.0. Labour and Extremists.The Swiss Labour Party has issued confidential circulars warning its adherents not to attempt any strikes for the present, especially isolated ones. The reason for this is probably the unsatisfactory conditions at present existing in many industries which might induce employers to think it preferable to close their Avorks rather than carry on trade under existing conditions.Events in Germany are being closely Avatched but the possibility of a general strike for purely political ends has lately somewhat receded into the background. The Zurich Socialists have, hoAvever, worked out plans for a revolution as soon as a favourable opportunity presents itself, Recent events in the; 1111111&apos; district arc having a considerable effect on the extreme elements in Switzerland, where the Communists are reported to be actively preparing for a general strike in which postal and telegraph employees are to join. Arms and ammunition are being constantly smuggled into the country and a regular corre-spondencc is being maintained with foreign extremists.In reply to a question in the Swiss National Council concerning tin; resumption of diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia, Motta, the President of the Swiss Confederation, stated that there can be no question of such relations being opened until a lasting Government has been established which definitely represents the wishes of the people and a definite guarantee has been given that propaganda for Avorld revolution in foreign countries shall cease. The International connections of the Extremists appear to have been strengthened and there is little doubt that they are receiving money for propaganda and other purposes from abroad. The principal centres of Bolshevik activity are apparently at Zurich, Wintertliur, Basel, Lucerne and Zug. An alarming tendency has manifested itself anomg a great many of the Government teachers and even among certain Professors at the various Universities, who appear to be responsible to a large extent for Bolshevik ideas in their respective establishments. On the other hand, the Swiss Party of Order is losing no time or opportunity in bringing its propaganda before the labouring classes and the rising generation, and is apparently meeting with a certain amount of success.Angelica Balabanova is reported to be in Switzerland and to be directing the Bolshevik movement in that country. Platten, as soon as he is released from his internment at Kovno, is to act as her assist-
ant, with the title of Commercial Attache. There are indications that the Swiss authorities intend to carry ou a general re-examination of foreigners with a view to their expulsion in the event of their being found undesirable.7. Bolshevist Propaganda Abroad.Jean Debrit received 100,000 Swiss francs for &quot; La Feuille &quot; on February 10th from the Deutsche Bank in Berlin, where a sum con-sisting of several million marks is said to have been deposited for Bolshevik propaganda abroad. Kopp, Radek and Litvinoff are said to be drawing in this fund.It is believed that the German Government have refused to sub-sidise &quot; La Feuille &quot; unless its penetration into France is guaranteed.During the last- two months de Kay has received 42,000 francs from a Russian source in support of &quot; La Feuille.&quot; But the Bolshevik Authorities have now lit upon the fact that &quot; La Feuille &quot; is not a purely humanitarian journal, as they thought, but that its main object is pro-German propaganda. Subsidies from Soviet Russia are likely to cease in consequence.There is, in fact, definite evidence that &quot; La Feuille. &quot; is a secretly financed German organ, and that as recently as February 10th of this year, Jean Debrit, the editor, received 2,000,000 marks from the Deutsche Bank. His recent appeals for financial assistance and threats to close down if it was not forthcoming, were published to hide the fact that the paper was making the best of both worlds and subsidised as it were from both sides of the screen. Possibly as a set-off against the discovery by the Bolsheviks that &quot; La Feuille &quot; is receiving money from another source, Jean Debrit has now organised a Society called &quot; Les Amis de la Feuille&quot; to rope in the humanitarians to engage in revolutionary propaganda pure and simple.8. Ex-Service Men&apos;s International Conference.Under the presidency of Henri Barbusse the International Congress of ex-Service men opened at Geneva on May 1st. France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Russia and Austria were represented as well as Great Britain, whose delegates were Ernest Mander and Alexander Scott, both members of the National Union of Ex-Service Men. In spite of the efforts of the Extreme French and Italian delegates, the motion for affiliation with the Third National was abandoned, the British and German delegates insisting that the ex-Service International was purely pacifist and not revolutionary or political,9. Miscellaneous.Italian agents are reported to be trying to create a movement among the population of the Ticino for a union with Italy. Their effort is having little success except among the Extreme Socialists who ap-apparently think that by joining Italy they would be in a better position to carry out their policy. In this movement the Italians appear to be receiving the support of the Germans, who are very much in evidence in Switzerland and with whom they maintain a close liaison.AUSTRIA.1. Militarism.The report that arms were being made by Austrian firms for the Polish and Czech Governments was confirmed in the latter part of
March. The contracts for Bohemia and for Poland are large, and are known to include machine guns and 100,000 rifles for the former. The Workmen^ Councils as sympathisers with Soviet Russia were trying to prevent the execution of the contracts.During March there were several Austrian Monarchist meetings in Vienna. The movement appears to he linked with its headquarters at Geneva by a certain Imperial Counsellor Wilczek. At a recent meeting the funds of the Party were given as 14,000,000 Crowns and it was resolved to send money to all important towns for propaganda among the Communal Police and Volkswelir.2. Communists.On the whole, however, Communism is on the increase. Two new Extremist papers have recently been published. It was rumoured in March that a secret Communist Conference, with delegates from Moscow and Italy was to be held in Vienna.The organisation of the Workmen&apos;s Battalions was also reported as proceeding apace both in Vienna and Wiener-Neustadt, and in other industrial regions. The workmen have arms, and the Authorities, though they know it, appear afraid to intervene. Indeed, the harmony between Soldiers&apos; Councils and Workers&apos; Councils indicates both a common doctrine and a common plan for revolutionary action.In March, therefore, there were indications that the Austrian Government was inclining towards peace with Soviet Russia, Social Democrats, thinking that relations with. Russia would strengthen the position of their party, while the Communist Party pressed for Russian representation at Vienna. The great bulwark against a Communist rising lies in the Police and the present Police President who is a man of marked ability and decision. He recruits his men from the country peasantry who have no sympathy with the town-bred Communist.The strain of the economic situation has gained the Vienna Com-munist Party many adherents. The Party displayed considerable activity during the; Kapp Putsch in Germany and even went so far as to demand the calling out of the Volkswelir and the occupation of munition depots as well as of official buildings, a demand eventually acceded to by the Government. Plans for the overthrow of the Govern-nient and the inevitable Dictatorship of the Proletariat were only not executed because of the timely warning of the Hungarian Bolshevik emigres (including Dr. Kunfi and the journalist, Franz Condor) who have lately transferred their allegiance from the Vienna Communist Party to the Social Democrats. These men urged that an Austrian Communist Republic would only have a few weeks&apos; life, and even if Germany momentarily became a Soviet Republic, it would soon return to ordered democracy. As a result Communist activity was confined to the occupation of the Wireless station in Vienna by a well armed mob led by Toman.More recently the Left Wing of the Austrian Social Democratic Party under the leadership of Joseph Prey, President of the Soldiers&apos; Councils, has declared its adherence to the Third International as a protest against Adler&apos;s Bill for the establishment of a regular army instead of the Volkswehr. The Austrian Socialist Democratic Party itself is inclined to participate in the Reconstruction International.May Day was declared a public holiday by the National Assembly and was celebrated without incident in Vienna. 100,000 Social Demo-crats paraded the streets of Vienna and 4,000 Communists met under Police supervision. It was significant that no police uniforms were to be seen about the streets.
HUNGARY.P&apos;Annunzio&apos;s foreign secretary, Leon Cochnitzky, has told an informant in a burst of confidence that the Hungarians have recently made proposals to the Poles for an attack on Czecho-Slavakia. This information has now been confirmed from three other independent sources.Many alarmist rumours and reports regarding the Bolshevik menace are being circulated, with or without the personal knowledge of Admiral Horthy. They are probably intended to justify the retention of armed forces which might eventually be used for a reactionary coup in con-junction with Germany and Russian Bolsheviks. Thus in April a member of the Hungarian Government alleged the discovery of a plot in which Friedrich, flu; ex-Premier, was to be induced to play the same; part as Karolyi prior to the Communist revolution. Friedrich, that is, after assuming power was to be made the cafs paw of the Reds, who would assume power as soon as it suited them. The plan was further stated to include the assassination of Horthy and certain members of the present Government.In March Karolyi was still in Prague, apparently in close touch with Czecho-Slovakian Ministry of the Interior, who explained their dealings with him as concerned with the arrest of Hungarians like Boehm, former Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army under Bela Kun. Karolyi&apos;s mother then said that if her son got into power again in Hungary he would hand the Government over to the workmen.May 1st passed off quietly in Budapest.At a meeting in London on May 11th the Bureau of the Inter-national Federation of Trade Unions decided to give effect to the resolution which it had passed in March to boycott Hungary in protest against the persecution of the workers there by the White Government. Trade Union centres are being circularised and organisations which are in a position to make the boycott immediately are being asked to devise measures to do so.CZECHOSLOVAKIA.The Czecho-Slovak elections have resulted in a three-fourths majority for the Czech and Slovak parties over the Germans and in a modified, but still considerable, success for the Socialists, who, however, will require the support of the Agrarians to form a solid and workable majority.Mutual efforts for a rapprochement between Saxony and Czecho-Slovakia are impeded by the active dislike of the Germans in Northern Bohemia for the Czecho-Slovak Republic.Militarists in Hungary were; reputed early in April to be conspiring against the life of President Masaryk, loyalty to whose person is held by Hungarian reactionaries as the sole bond between the Slovak troops and the Slovak-Czecho Republic. Masaryk&apos;s friend-liness for, and faith in Russia, even in her present distress, is bound to make him distrusted by reactionaries in many quarters.Communist activity was reported in March, especially in the mining district all round Kladno, by Prague, where flic question of nationali-zation was used by the Extremists to cause trouble. In the Brux district anarchists and communists appear to have joined hands in preparation for the demonstrations on May 1st, at which, however, there was eventually no disorder.
4. RUSSIA AND BORDER STATES. RUSSIA.1. General.British refugees of standing who have returned from Soviet Russia represent Communism as having no following among the people them-selves. This is more completely true of the peasantry, whose one desire now is a free press, free voting and above all the recognition of their individual rights to the property they now hold.Two such informants, including mr.. Boyden, The Rev. Frank North&apos;s principal assistant, said they believed that friendly propaganda, directed by persons who had lived in the country, carefully worded, also to indicate that the Entente stands for the policy mentioned, would be the most effective means of bringing about the change of regime which is continually in the minds and on the lips of workmen and peasants. Our own late propaganda on the Northern Front was described by one of the informants as a model of what it should not have been. Good propaganda pamphlets, however, with a striking cover and sown broadcast by aeroplane, would now, this informant says, prove effective. Even if, as is probable, they fell into illiterate hands, they would soon reach the village schoolmaster or priest or someone else who could read them aloud, and would, in the dearth of newspapers, be eagerly assimilated.In German trade circles it is believed that a new Bourgeoisie is being formed in Soviet Russia, which consists of those workmen who have proved themselves to be above the average and who have acquired a certain amount of wealth and property under the Soviet regime. This class is now actively casting about for ways and means to defend what it has acquired and in due course will probably become a serious menace to the Bolshevik authorities. Rosowski, one of the Trade delegates in London, has stated to a confidant that recently (presume-ably early this month during the stopping of the wireless) there had been serious disturbances both in Moscow and Petrograd, and that in July further disturbances, which might even result in the downfall of the Soviet re&apos;gime, were to be expected.The Purists among the Soviet Authorities are well aware of the clanger of the Bolshevik regime which this birth of a new pro-pertied class of peasants and workmen has created. Their schemes to abolish capitalism and speculation grow more fantastical as the danger increases. The value of money in Russia is steadily decreasing and a new issue of notes printed in sheets like stamps and torn off as required was reported in April. It has not been ascertained whether these notes are identical with the proposed issue of an anti-speculative currency spoken of to Mr. Boyden by Jacobowitch shortly before Mr. Boyden&apos;s journey home. The purpose of this alleged new currency was to prevent individual thrift and speculation. It was to consist of notes valid for one month only, and of different colours for each month. These would be issued to workers on the last day of each month. During the ensuing month they could be used for purchases from Government stores and depots all commodities, etc., being by this time in the hands of the Government. On the expiry of that month they would be valueless. Meanwhile, to forestall hoarding in kind, which might defeat the scheme, the vigilance of the authorities and the number of domiciliary visits would be redoubled. Klishko, late Secretary to Litvinoff and now Secretary to the trade delegation to England, denies that any such scheme has in fact been
devised. It is his present business, however, to bring out harmonies and silence discords, in order that Communist Russia may receive the recognition of Capitalist England. He might, therefore, be expected to leave in the shade the plans of his more thorough-going colleagues. Meanwhile Mr. BoydenS testimony stands, and has since been confirmed from an independent source.2. Personnel of the Foreign Office.During Litvinoffs absence at Copenhagen a new Department has been formed at the Foreign Olfice called &quot; The Department of Allied Countries.&quot; Litvinoff is at its head, and is represented in his absence from Moscow by Rosenberg and Fincberg. The latter was previously in charge of the propaganda department of the Third International, in which post he has been succeeded by one Bloomfield or Blomfield, said to be a British subject. Fineberg has been some years in this country prior to the revolution and has relations still living in the East end of London.3. The Jews.According to a Wireless message from Moscow early this month the Jewish Bund has decided to accept the Bolshevik programme on condition that its autonomy be recognised by the Russian Communist Party. As a result of this action the more moderate elements have seceded from the Bund. The announcement of the British mandate for Palestine has caused great enthusiasm amongst the Jews in Russia and the news has been spread to the remotest corners of the country. Many Jews are reported in consequence to have applied to the Soviet Authorities fpr permission to emigrate. It is not impossible that this step, probably taken by the British Authorities without special regard to the situation in Russia, may yet do much to sap the Bolshevik power.4. The Polish Offensive.The Polish Offensive appears to have proved the most effective of the successive attacks against Soviet Russia in forging th Red Armies into a really dangerous weapon. Speaking in Moscow about the middle of April on behalf of the Foreign Office at a secret meeting of the Russian Communist leaders, Tchitcherin fulminated against the traitor Petlura, who is said to have signed an agreement with the Poles by which the latter would have Polesia, East Galicia, Cholm and the use of the port of Odessa. It had been further agreed that the Poles were to have two ministers in the Ukrainian Council, one acting for Polish affairsj and the other for general questions. Speaking on the army at the same meeting Trotsky declared that he did not fear the Poles. His best troops were concentrated on that front. They included several thousand of Denikin&apos;s officers who had offered their services to the Soviet Government. The Russian Military Schools, he stated, would be able to contribute 20,000 officers before the end of the year, who would become leaders of the Communist workmen in peace as in war. Brusiloff, the famous Russian General, is now chairman of a Special Commission, composed of military and political experts, to advise as to the rapid concentration and most advantagous disposition of troops against the Poles.   According to a member of the Commission whop
recently returned from Soviet Russia great pressure is being used to keep ammunition and aeroplane factories at work.Prior to the Offensive, Radek, who is now directing a special bureau for propaganda against the Poles, stated in the course of conversation that the Bolsheviks could trust the Ukrainian peasant to deal with the Polish troops as he had dealt with the Germans. Me might add as he had dealt with the Bolsheviks also. Bolshevik rule in the Ukraine was confined almost entirely to the railways and large towns. The rest of the country consists of small Republics whose support Petlura hopes to gain. Probably, however, a Petlurist administration would only obtain a hold upon the Ukraine as superficial as that of the Bolsheviks, Germans and Poles.According to a Wireless message dated Moscow, April 9th, an appeal by the Ukrainian Soviet Government to the people calling on them to take up arms against the invader, found small acceptance with the Mcnsheviks, the Bund, and the Social Revolutionaries of the Left. Only the few Communists and Independnets responded.5. Resumption of Trade Relations.There are ever stronger indications that Litvinoff regards an arrange -ment with England (temporary of course and representative; of no change of the Bolshevik heart) as vital to Bolshevik policy in Europe, not to mention the safety and fortune of himself and of his satellites, Rosenberg, Fineberg, etc., which are bound up with the success or failure of the Soviet regime.The threats to Transcaucasia and Persia and the eagerness with which the Soviet Authorities look to successes or reverses in Poland are indicative of the policy of bullying England in the East while wheedling her in the West. Litvinod is convinced that Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s advances are made without conviction, that representative English policy is really that of Lord Curzon and Mr, Churchill, and that victories of the Red Armies alone will really shake it.As long as Litvinoff thought that there was a chance of getting to London himself he intrigued against Krassin going there, but as soon as the Polish offensive began he urged that Krassin should start without delay. He is much exercised at the prospect of being deported from Denmark, especially as his position has been much shaken by the recent refusal to negotiate with him ; accordingly, he made it a condition that if Krassin went to London the British Government should ask the Danes to allow him (Litvinoff) to remain in Copenhagen. This suited Krassin, who was afraid that if Litvinoff returned to Moscow in his present mood he would stab him in the back. Though for the moment the two are double-harnessed by circumstances and have to pull the same way, they dislike one another very cordially and Litvinoff is now suggesting to Moscow that Krassin is at the bottom of the &quot; conspiracy &quot; which prevents him coming to London.Before Nogin and Klishko left for England there was a serious quarrel between Krassin and Litvinoff about the disclosures in the &quot; Hamburger Eremdenblatt &quot; of Litvinoff&apos;s activities during the Danish strikes. Krassin insisted that Litvinoff should insert a de&apos;menti, as he had undoubtedly seen many of the Danish Syndicalists; with great reluctance Litvinoff consented and the iWmeiiti appeared in the &quot; Arbejdet &quot; of the 15th May. Litvinoff thereafter refused to see any more Danish Syndicalists. When asked why he was so anxious for the Delegation to go to London, he replied that the object was to get into touch with the Sinn Fein leaders, with whom he was in the best relations; Nogin and Rozowsky agreed to do this, but pointed
out that there might be difficulties, as they would be under strict surveillance. As a consequence of the quarrel Litvinoff has now given an ultimatum to Tchitcherine that if Krassin is allowed a free hand he, Litvinoff, will be compelled to return to Russia.Krassin is greatly disturbed by the Polish Offensive, which he argues was only undertaken after Allied consent had been obtained at San Remo, He is in consequence more inclined than ever to doubt the Allies&apos; desire to resume economic relations with Russia.Krassin, who really represents the policy of a capture of the Soviet regime by International Capitalism, has undertaken the responsibility of securing from the Soviet Government a guarantee of compensation of the legitimate foreign claims against Russia.An attempt was made with the aid of M. Scavenius to establish a clearing-house in Copenhagen for European trade, but the latest information is that the Danish side of the organisation has fallen through.Meanwhile, the last shred of pretence that the Centrosoyus (*) is independent of the Soviet Government has been torn away by the dismissal of Berkenheim and the three members of the Central Bureau ; the last named were arrested on a charge of assisting the Whites during Udenitch&apos;s advance on Petrograd.A reliable report indicates that the gold reserves of Soviet Russia are running low and that payments will soon be made in platinum.A Moscow Wireless states that Finnish commercial firms have consented to contract with the Soviet Government for the delivery of agricultural machinery to the value of six million kroner in gold.In an interview at Copenhagen, Rosowski, one of the Russian Co-operative delegates, said that owing to lack of sea transport the Bolsheviks would much rather have goods delivered to them by rail. The Polish war, of course, now blocks the one route by which such delivery would be possible. Rosowski added that Germany had offered Russia up to 12 months credit but that England wanted cash for her goods.An offer by the London manager of the Russian Commercial and Industrial Bank to place his bank at the disposal of the Russian Co-operatives for the purpose of undertaking financial operations tu the United Kingdom, was accepted late in April by the Soviet Authori-ties.Krassin has broken off all the negotiations for the purchase of naphtha, mentioned in the article on the Reval delegation in Part 2 of this issue, owing to the Bolshevik occupation of Baku.Klishko, the Secretary, of the Trade Delegation, who has been in London for some days, has already broken his agreement, in the spirit if not in the letter, by negotiating in political matters with Theodore Rothstein, the secret agent of the Bolshevik Government.(i. Concessions to and Employment of Foreigners in Russia.Acute tension has existed for some time between the Extraordinary Commission, (Chrezvycfoiika), headed by Dzherzhinsky, and Lenin&apos;s party, which for this purpose includes Krassin as well as Tchitcherin, on the question of the rights and status to be accorded to foreign experts coming to Russia. LemVs party recognises that without foreign help, advice, and organisation, the early economic reconstrutionc* &apos;l lie one Russian trading body that had Borne independence left (vide March Report, Part 2),p 2
3Gof Russia, which is the sole chance of the Soviet Government, is im-possible, the Gargantuan cannibalism of the revolution having deprived Russia of all ability to set her own affairs in order. The Soviet Authorities&apos; single aim as far as home politics are concerned, is, there-fore, now, the economic reconstruction of Russia, which Lenin regards as an indispensable bridge for the advent of world Communism. Djerjinsky&apos;s party, barbarian, hot-headed and uncalculating, protest against the infringements upon the doctrines of pure Communism which the new Party implies. The difference between the two Parties was indeed reported to be so acute that for a lime a coup dhHat one way or other was regarded in competent quarters as not impossible.Recently the balance seems to have tilted to the right. Extremists like Djerjinsky and Zinovieff have, for the time at least, lost the day. All parties are desperately anxious to trade with foreign countries and eager to invite foreigners to aid in their internal reconstruction, it has been arranged that foreigners who wish to (some to Soviet Russia will have to live as the Russians do, and will receive 3000 roubles a month, a room, and the usual rations of flu; first category. An additional salary will be paid to them in their own country. Whether, once in, they will be allowed out again, is another matter.Perhaps the most interesting individual instance of a foreigner so employed is that of Mi:. Kelly, an American engineer, now employed by the Soviet Authorities on a roving commission through Russia to help in the reconstruction of transport. Mr. Kclly&apos;s wife in New York is said to receive 200 dollars a week, while he himself has all his expenses in Russia paid. Kelly is said to have been the real contriver of Trot-sky^ much vaunted labour armies.Meanwhile, it is evident that even the party which regards the admission of foreigners as indispensable does so unwillingly and with great fear lest the truth about Soviet Russia and her utter disorganisation-tion and lack of provisions should be spread abroad once foreigners are admitted. LitvinofFs objection to the admission of Swedish workmen (see under Sweden) shows this. Applicants from Holland were also dissuaded from coming.A recent Wireless message sent by the Chairman of the Supreme; Council of National Economy also makes it clear that the Bolsheviks are not particularly anxious to receive foreign workmen. Workers coming from abroad are instructed to send a delegation in advance to study the economic situation and warned to expect no better conditions than Russian workers. Delegations are required to make a declaration that they are aware, and that the foreign workers whom they represent are aware, that in coming to Russia they must expect privations.7. Industrial Conditions.At the 9th Communist Congress which came to an end at Moscow on April 5th, a resolution was passed in favour of the supersession of collegiate control in industrial affairs by responsible individual control. Rikoff, the head of the Commissariat for Internal Economy, together with Krassin and Litvinoff, recommended concessions to factory owners and that they should be given back their factories to run with a guarantee of percentage of profits. The importance of this as a proof of the breakdown of Communist theory applied to matters of economy and as evidence of a return to bourgeois individualism cannot be over-rated,
The 3rd Trade Union Congress recently held at Moscow recognised that in the present economical and financial condition of the country, further monetary increases of wages could neither benefit workmen nor act as an inducement to them. It was therefore resolved to establish an obligatory minimum output for each worker, to introduce a system of premiums in order to increase production, and to establish an army to supply the workers with food and other prime necessities in kind. As this form of payment, however, only amounted to about half a pound of bread daily, it was, at the same time, found necessary to devise a new method of obtaining food. What is known as the &quot; self-support-ing scheme &quot; came into being. This scheme consists in licensed foraging expeditions of factory hands into the country to requisition grain, etc., from the peasants and bring it back for the benefit of the factories. It is, in short, the system of Robin Hood and his merry men.  Those sent on these food expeditions are in many cases simplybands of marauders.On the other hand this method of obtaining food is often supple-in entary to the scheme of payment by rations. A factory will bo given a train consisting of an engine and thirty trucks to repair in its spare time. It finishes the work. As a reward for its industry its workmen are allowed to drive and man the train to a district where there is still grain or other food and to return with the trainload of it to help the factory rations.Robin Hood, however, predominates, and a perverse ingenuity has contrived to superimpose legalised anarchy on legalised serfdom.The introduction of piecework into the factories has been a disastrous failure and has resulted in a decrease of 30 per cent, on previous production.8. The Failure of Labour Conscription.The Polish offensive has come just in time to stem the utter ckr moralisation of the Red Army.   In March and the earlier part of April Labour Conscription had virtually failed, and that from the worst possible cause, the indifference or active distaste of the workers themselves.    The labouring classes and the peasantry look upon Trotsky&apos;s labour battalions as only another way of robbing them of their produce.   The peasants, being withheld from the land and not being allowed to work in their own way what they persisted in regarding as their own, were more and more unwilling to apply their energies to the holy task of reconstruction.   Ill-fed and hopeless, nourished like children on rations with a promise of more if they were good, they were more than inclined to melt away to their homes.   In the garrisons of Petrogracl and Eronstadt men of the same parish collected, together arms, machine guns and field kitchens and made off home with them. The Moderates took advantage of the bad conditions to spread anti-Communist propaganda.The Soviet Authorities becoming the while more and more helpless, at first tried severity. The Central Executive Committee decided to establish a special Flying Inspection Commission, composed of com-petent men with technical knowledge, to check the individual output of the workers. In all. cases where slacking was discovered a protocol was drawn up and the guilty summoned before a Tribunal. They announced further that those who shirk skilled work in which they are specialists are to be regarded as deserters and treated accordingly. Late in April they were obliged to reiterate orders to no less than 26 districts to send delegates for transport work.   The original order
that 10 per cent, of the population should report for such work had not been complied with.The Central Executive Committee later also found it expedient to issue, certainly not for foreign consumption, but yet with no accept-ance at home, assurances that undemobilised Red Army soldiers employed in the Army of Labour need have no anxiety for their families and fields, which local Executive Committees and Village Soviets would look after. This, however, was exactly what the peasant soldier did not want; he wanted to manage his land and his family himself, or, if he belonged to the regions of Communal ownership, he wanted to look after his interests in the commune and not leave it to be neglected or worse by others.Things had come to such a pass that early in April Trotsky was fain to announce that the Red Army would be dissolved as soon as possible and that a militia would take its place. His armies turned to Labour were melting out of his control, if he declared for a militia it was as the one solution which did not divide defence and labour or put the peasants and working classes out of touch with the Army.At a secret meeting of the Russian Communist leaders held in Moscow about the middle of April it was declared that the Labour Army had been a disappointment and that the only hope for Russia depended on the success of Krassin&apos;s economic peace negotiations. Lenin was on this occasion very bitter against the Entente. &quot; Their greed,&quot; he said, &quot; had induced them to seek peace with Soviet Russia. Litvinoff seems to be right when he advises us not to give in to the Allies in the least. Naturally we must make peace, but we must not permit those human hyenas to devour Russia little by little.&quot;9. The Land Problem.When the workmen came to know that land was being distributed in the country a large number of them left their factories. They now till just enough of the big estates to keep themselves and their families.A British subject who worked for some; time on a Soviet farm testifies to the unpopularity of the Communist method of farming, and says that in many cases the old system, by which everybody receives the same treatment, but can leave, taking his belongings with him, has been reverted to. Employees on these farms do not share in profits. They receive fixed wages. Seed is given to the farmers by the Authorities without payment. None but a little barley sold last autumn has been received for the coming year.According to an informant who has recently returned from Soviet Russia, the old system of the Mir or village community, by which peasants receive one strip of good land, one strip of medium quality and one of poor land, is a considerable obstacle to the Soviet farm. The strips of land are often miles apart, a fact which, taken with the peasants obstinate way of clinging to his holding, makes a more de-developed co-operative treatment impossible. Just before the Polish offensive, the Bolsheviks were considering the formation of an agri-cultural army, since commencement of agricultural work on a large scale was seen to have become imperative.According to a Bolshevik Wireless message the Government Committee of Youth, working in conjunction with the Labour Com-missariat, has started mobilising children and has formed both school children and students of both sexes into detachments for working on Soviet farms. Reliable information has been received that estates of Russian subjects are now being sold to certain Englishmen who are
unmolested in Russia and handed over in good order to the new owners. The buyers require that the Russian owners must have title deeds and that the transaction must be antedated to before the Bolshevik re&apos;gimc.10. The Release of Mr. North and British Intercession for the Remnants of Denikin&apos;s Army.The inhumanity of Bolshevik diplomacy (perhaps also, more charitably considered, the desperation of the Bolshevik re&apos;gimc to obtain peace and recognition) has come out in their calculations and balancings of the value of Lord Curzon&apos;s intervention on behalf of the remains of Denikin&apos;s forces, against their own desire to open trade and diplomatic relations with Great Britain. They have; used the lever for what it was worth, taking into account that the intervention came from the &quot; sentimental &quot; British and increasing accordingly the equivalent demanded. Radek&apos;s reply to Lord Curzon&apos;s intervention, issued by wireless, was a master/piece of hypocritical subtlety. The Bolsheviks, he said, could afford to show mercy to the Whites since they knew that the possibility of a counter-revolution in Russia had now been finally removed. Since the British Government had advocates-catccl so humane a policy towards Russian counter-revolutionaries the Soviet Authorities hoped that it would assist the Hungarian people&apos;s Commissaries at present interned in Austria in their journey to Russia and would take vigorous measures with regard to the Communist prisoners in White Hungary. No reply to these suggestions was returned.Much the same state of mind and temper was displayed in the case of Mr. North. The question in this case was whether it was more expedient to release him with the rest of the British refugees with a view to conciliating the British, on whose favour resumption of trade relations depended, or whether, on the other hand, he should be involved in a trumped up accusation of conspiracy against the Soviet Authorities and disposed of by imprisonment or otherwise. Mr. North knew too much, and Litvinoff thought he would carry too much weight in England, Litvinoff, in the full discussion of the policy to be followed with regard to Mr. North, pressed consistently and mercilessly for his arrest. There is now no doubt that the accusations of Maria Ivanowna and Grehgross, two White Russians, who, before the Bolshevik Tribunal, accused Mr. North to his face of having sub-subsidised anti-Bolshevik plots and of having been connected with Paul Dukes, were made at the instance of the Soviet Authorities. Mr. North&apos;s return is only due to better counsels, for which the economic necessities of Soviet Russia are responsible, prevailing at the last moment.11. The Soviet Authorities and Religion.Although religion in Soviet Russia is outwardly tolerated, severe repressive measures still continue. Under the present re&apos;gime all priests must obtain from the Government a permit to officiate and none are released from any of the manual tasks of citizenship. Their permits arc valid only for three months. In schools the Ikons have been removed and religious teaching forbidden. Government articles attacking religion as &quot; the opiate of the people &quot; are published by news-paper and pamphlet. Church marriages are no longer considered binding, nor funeral services allowed without a special permit.
12. Dr. Martini.A good deal of discussion has arisen around the recent actions and postures of Dr. Martini, late of the Danish Red Cross. This gentleman was reported in March to be at Helsingfors engaged in some capacity in the repatriation of British subjects from Russia. He at the same time allowed it to be pretty widely understood that he had been deputed by the British Government, which was unwilling itself openly to communicate with the Soviet Government, to enter into negotiations with the Bolsheviks. In April he went to Russia with a consignment of drugs and is reported to have assumed the same pose and to have occupied the British Embassy in Petrograd.His Majesty&apos;s Representative at Helsingfors knew nothing of Dr. Martini&apos;s alleged mission.13. A Possible Trend of Events.Those Russians who are bold enough to make forecasts believe that the next phase may be a dictatorship by Trotsky. They point to the fact that, when he was asked to sign the decree establishing industrial conscription, he declined, on the ground that if he was to be in charge of the system, the orders must be addressed to him by a higher authority, and he insisted that the decree should be signed by Lenin himself and should contain a paragraph to the effect that Comrade Trotsky was ordered to take charge of the Industrial Army. Thus, when the time comes, he will be able to say that he had nothing to do with this most unpopular measure, but was conscripted like the rest.FINLAND.1. Failure of Peace Negotiationswith the Bolsheviks.Peace negotiations between Finland and Soviet Russia were broken off towards the middle of April, owing to the Bolsheviks unconscionable demands, which included, alternatively, payment by Finland of 17 milliard roubles for Russian property left in Finland, or the cession of the whole Viborg province. These conditions were thought scarcely to hide aggressive intentions on the part of militant Bolshevism. During the negotiations the Bolsheviks, despite the shortage of fuel, prepared their fleet for action.2. Trade Negotiations with Soviet Russia.Finnish business men are reported to have engaged very tentatively in trade negotiations with the Soviet Government. The visit late in March of the Russian Co-operative delegates under Krassin at first whetted their ardour. The conditions proposed by one Metchnikoff, the self-declared official representative of the Soviet authorities, who became active in Helsingfors early in April, seem rather to have damped it again. Grain, furs, leather, gold coin, gold or platinum bars were offered by Metchnikoff in payment for manufactured goods, chemicals, and especially paper. Incertitude regarding Bolshevik promises and the rumours of extraordinary conditions remaining behind are said to&apos;have frightened Finnish business men, who have little to offer Russia except small manufactured articles and chemicals.. 3. The Left Socialists.The Left Socialists under Dr. Lassy and Sulo Vuolijoki have been
fighting hard and apparently unsuccessfully to absorb the Social Democrat organisations. Labour adherents to the Social Democtatic Party were induced not to pay their party subscriptions so that the connection might lapse and their subscriptions be devoted to the new Left Party, winch professes the Third International. Sulo Vuolijoki always seems to be well in funds and is prepared to pay almost any sum to get work carried out, probably out of Bolshevik money. According to Mr. Lansbury, Vuolijoki is about to undergo a course of treatment for alcoholism.The Finnish authorities, who have already imprisoned Dr. Lassy, are watching for an opportunity to do the same by Sulo Vuolijoki. Deprived of its most important leaders, it is improbable that the Left Socialist Party, even if it desired representation in Parliament  which its principles reject would stand any chance in the elections.Nevertheless, the Social Democrats were much alarmed, and pro-posed that their whole Party should move to the Left, to act as a brake on the Left Socialists. Their new Bureau, intended to counter-act Dr. Lassy&apos;s &quot; Workers&apos; News Bureau,&quot; is now to absorb the latter and to be the instrument of Socialists from Right to extreme Left. It is to be International in scope. The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; is said to be interested in it. The move seems to constitute a victory for the Left Socialists.Finnish Socialists in America have decided to give 1,000,000 marks to the new Party, which is to publish a daily paper.4. German Activities.The policy of the Allies towards the Bolsheviks is reported to have very much increased German influence in Finland. It is reported that at the time of the Kapp Putsch the Jews in Finland knew of the impending outbreak. One well known Jew sent his wife to Germany, just before, to remove his money and valuables from German banks. Jaeger organisations in Finland are reported to have received large sums of money and to be directing their energies to undermining the authority of President Stahlberg. The recent visit to Berlin of General Mannerheiin is considered significant.Most newspapers are under German influence in some way or other. In spite of this, however, German traders are looked upon with suspi-cion, and the Finns much prefer to do business with the British.The anniversary of the capture of Helsingfors by the Germans on April 12th, 1918, was celebrated by laying wreaths on the graves of Germans who fell on that occasion. Representatives of Mannerheim and members of the Schutz-Corps were present.Arms and ammunition addressed to the Finnish Government and believed to be for the Finnish Sehutz-Corps are reported to have been unloaded from German ships at Helsingfors during April as follows : One ship : 292 tons of small arms ammunition. Another : 100,000 rifles and 400 machine guns. A third : 6 motor lorries, 2 motors, 40 field kitchens, ammunition limber and a box containing rifles.Sixty guns in all are reported to have been unloaded in Finnish ports for the use of the Schutz Corps.5. Extremists.A Central Committee of the Finnish Communist Party is being
formed at Viborg and several leaders of the Finnish workers have already been appointed to posts on this Committee.There is a tendency at Labour meetings and in lied circles gener-ally to discourage open revolution at the present juncture unless matters are brought to a head by a Bolshevik attack. It is thought that all that makes for disorganisation in Finland is detrimental to the Soviet Government, since it incapacitates the country as regards the supply of food, etc., to Russia. By keeping quiet and sending assistance to Russia the Bolsheviks will strengthen their position and the position of the Finnish Proletariat. Besides the Left Socialists prefer that the odium of making peace with the Bolsheviks should fall on the Right. Among the more moderate Socialists the old hatred and distrust of the Russians is still reported to exist.0. Miscellaneous.A religious revival led by Pastor Sirenius, once of the Finnish Sailors&apos; Mission in London, is looked to as making for mediation between parties.Reports indicate that the Finnish police are extremely corrupt and not above receiving bribes for the release of imprisoned Com-munists.It is reported that the Swedish Diplomatic Bag between Stockholm and Helsingfors has been used for transmitting Bolshevik propaganda to Finland.Baltic  tates. ESTHONIA.The new land legislation, the Bolshevik methods for the confiscation of factory output adopted by the Government, and compulsory labour for procuring firewood, are reported to have brought the country into utter confusion.The foreign policy of Hellat, the Esthonian Minister of the Interior, is being severely criticised by his colleagues in the Government, as tending to create bad feeling between Esthonia and European Powers. Tennison, the Prime Minister, would seem to he honestly pro-Ally. The sentiments of other members of the Cabinet are doubtful. They realise, however, that it would be imprudent meanwhile actively to oppose the Entente ; an attitude due to Esthonia&apos;s indebtedness to the United States and Great Britain. (For further particulars re Hellat, Tennison and their policies, as well as an explanation of how the Minister of the Interior comes to be meddling with Foreign Affairs, sec Part II. of this issue).A Bolshevik Diplomatic Mission, under Radck, is expected to arrive shortly in Reval.There is much corruption amongst the officials of the Esthonian Government which is becoming more and more unpopular among the peasants. The murder of Y. Poska, late member of the Constituent Assembly and one of the Esthonian Peace Conference delegates with Soviet Russia, is attributed to his having been in the pay of the Bol-sheviks, who are said to have rewarded him well for the concessions he made them during the negotiations.The army formerly comprised about 30,000 men. Since the peace it has been reduced to about 10,000 by granting leave to the bulk of the soldiers. Peasants among the latter have been sent back to their homes, leaving the workmen with the colours, since the economic
situation deprives workmen of employment, and since also a workman force will be more amenable to a Red or Bolshevik Government than a peasant army. The Baltic contingent, which was, of course, strongly reactionary, has been dispersed among the rest of the troops.The peasantry in Esthonia now bear a grudge to the Government, because, having given them the land, it has not given them.stock, seed and implements along with it. Many peasants, therefore, desire the return of the former proprietors who provided them with these necessaries, The labouring classes further complain that in splitting up the land, consideration is always given, first to the soldiers, then to the people with a small capital, and only in the last instance to the labourers. Hellat, in his fear that the peasantry and labouring classes will vote for the Right under Laidoner in the elections now almost due, is trying hard to postpone the latter for 4 years. Should he succeed he will be virtually dictator. Latvia.Peace negotiations between Latvia and Soviet Russia have opened in Moscow. The Latvian Government is claiming the recognition of the Independence of its country and an indemnity of 271- million roubles.POLAND.1. The Offensive.The Bolsheviks are seriously alarmed by the Polish advance and the capture of Kicff. Trotsky has been issuing appeal upon appeal, each more feverish than the last, to the workmen to bring their whole effort to bear on the destruction of the capitalist adversary. These appeals, however, are probably for consumption abroad. With their own nationals the Soviet Authorities have methods of persuasion more potent than appeals.The Bolsheviks were reported about the middle of April to have little confidence in their troops on the Polish fronts ; in consequence they were forming two other armies, said to be specially imbued with Bolshevik doctrines, one in Siberia and the second in Turkey. The danger for the Poles lies in the North, where the anticipated Bolshevik counter-offensive is at present developing, and where they are reported to have none too many reserves. It is reliably reported that, prior to the Polish offensive, Litvinoff was told by the Foreign Office in Moscow that the situation in the Ukraine had become serious, by reason of frequent anti-Bolshevik risings, which it would require a large number of troops to quell.Early in April a &quot; Daily Herald &quot; correspondent who went to War-saw was officially told by the Polish Foreign Office that it would allow no telegrams to the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; to pass-out of Poland, and that inasmuch as Poland was at war with Soviet Russia and the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; was a staunch defender of the enemy of Poland, any attempt on his part to give information or to correspond with the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; would render him liable to instant arrest. The correspondent returned to England.2. Bolshevik Emissaries,Sturm, a Russian, noted for his participation in the Hamburg revolutionary movement, was reported early in April as about to be sent by the Bolsheviks on a special mission to Poland. He was to join Kaminski, the People&apos;s Commissioner, who was to be sent to Warsaw, from Russia several months ago, and between them they were to
prepare the soil for a Bolshevik invasion. There has been no further news of this ill-timed mission.A certain Simon Misanowitch, reputed a courier for the American Industrial Workers of the World, reached Moscow in August last. He was commissioned by Trotsky to take reports to Berlin ami Chicago and also to deliver 3000 roubles to the Revolutionary Party in Warsaw. 3. May Day.On the 1st May processions totalling probably over 80,000 persons, marched through the streets of Warsaw, with banners on which were written inscriptions in varying degrees of redness &quot; Down with the Government,&quot; &quot;Down with the Army, end the war,&quot; and &quot;Long live the Revolution ; down with the bourgeoisie ; long live Lenin and Trotsky.&quot; Cabmen in the town were given 1.00 marks apiece to drop work and join the processions. The processions were well organised but there was little enthusiasm, and no riots or disturbances.5. BALKAN AND EAST EUROPEAN STATES.ROUMANIA,Labour conditions seem generally to have improved since General Averescu, Avho does not deal gently with disturbances, came into power.In a strike at the Petroshani coal mines, upon which the State Railways at present depend, several strikers who were Hungarians, and had fired the mine, were shot.JUGO-SLAVIA. Strikes and Demonstrations.Unrest among the Students of the University at Belgrade, which culminated recently in the declaration of a strike, was ascribed to the inadequacy of the scale, of State assistance to students under present abnormal conditions. But the movement had also a political aspect. Numerous meetings have been held by the Students advocating the overthrow of the existing order. The Communist successes in the April Municipal elections in Croatia-Slovenia are thought to be an index of the increasingly unruly spirit among the people.A Railway Strike; called at Belgrade on April 10th and ending on April 29th, resulted in a victory for the Government, but not before a general sympathetic strike had been declared for 48 hours in Belgrade on April 20th and other sympathetic strikes at Laibach and Agram.Government restrictions on the May 1st celebrations were so severe that the majority of the people stayed indoors There were no incidents, and all the shops remained open.The conflict about Fiunie.An April report on the situation in Fiume stated that the Jugo-Slav army was then ready to rise at any moment, having received artillery, arms and ammunition in Salonica. The military authorities were said to expect a war with Ita\y and to aim at the conquest not only of FiUme, but of Trieste, Gorizia and the Isonzo territory.There were, indications early this month that malcontents with Italy&apos;s share of the spoils of the European war were endeavouring to stir up trouble further afield than Fiume. General Beppino Garibaldi (son or grand-son of Garibaldi) went to Agram where he was enthusi-astically received by the Italian Minority to whom he announced&quot; that he would soon return.
BULGARIA.1. German Penetration.The economic situation in Bulgaria is reported as extremely grave. In the industrial world tilings are going from bad to worse and unless machinery can be repaired, many factories will be compelled to close down. The cost of living is extremely high. The Germans appear to be taking advantage of this situation to spread pro-German propa-ganda.Matchboxes and cigarette papers are being given away by German Commercial agents. Enclosed in each is a message: &quot; Warm greetings to our Brothers of an oppressed nation,&quot; or promise-! that the Germans will soon come to help.2. Political.The Bulgarian elections early in April passed off quietly. Although the Agrarians under Stambolisky beaded the poll with 110 seats, they did not succeed in getting an absolute; majority, probably owing to the use made by the Opposition of a scheme proposed by the Govern-ment for introducing obligatory service for men and women alike, including a sort of Labour army to be trained for the first three months in barracks and then to be sent to work of national importance, such as road-mending, etc. (It may be said in passing that this scheme is quite possibly in reality a cover for military training in excess of Treaty provisions).If the elections at Burgas, Varna and Plevna were found technically faulty by the special Controlling Commission, the Agrarians would get-five.or six more seats at the expense of the Communists, thus assuring for themselves an absolute majority in the Chamber. Communism in the towns is certainly not to be despised, but is not expected to make headway with the peasant proprietor class which Stambolsky is detcr-mined to make the ruling factor in the state.After the Agrarians, the Communists appear to have obtained the largest number of seats (50). Their gains were achieved at the expense of the Broad Socialists, who, having instigated the recent strike of the railway, post and telegraph employees with the object of overthrowing the Agrarian Cabinet, at the last moment left &quot;the Avorkmen in the; lurch. As a result they obtained only 9 seats in the present Chamber, as compared with 38 in the last, the workmen giving their votes to the Communists who during the strike had supported them with flour and bread purchased with funds sent from Russia.GREECE.1. Political.The Greek King&apos;s morganatic marriage (See April report) is now an open secret. For the time it led to a belief in Greece itself that he would abdicate, and Prince Arthur of Connaught was mentioned as a possible successor. The King appears, however, again to have realised the expediency of maintaining the dynasty and to have mastered the fervour of romance with which he was credited.The success of M. Embericos&apos; new Party (See Report No. 18) was reported early in March to be small. Several of his followers, all personal friends of M. Venizelos, wished to save the latter from Repoulis and other ministers who were said to be coquetting with, and even offering posts to, members of the Opposition,
There was some talk late in the same month of a fresh. Party, the &quot; Party of the New Countries &quot; to represent Epirus and Macedonia, and to act with the Government on all except local matters.2. Royalist Intrigue.Pro-Constantino intrigue appears to centre at Geneva round a certain General Khajanesty, uncle of Demetrius Theophilatos, the ship owner and head of Greek Royalist intrigues in the United States. Theophilatos&apos; steamers were to run guns to places indicated by Kha-jancsty. The latter is in close touch with Gounaris, the ex-Prime Minister and the former Greek General Staff Officer, Colonel Metaxas, both of whom are living at Siena. The intriguers in Switzerland were said to be trying to make mischief between the French and British by suggesting to the French Minister in Berne that British pro-Veni-zelism was another instance of the classic perfidy of England.Early in March the Turkish Charge d&apos;Affaires at Athens was trans-mitting to his Government, through the Dutch Legation, information received from Greek Officials regarding alleged Royalist tendencies in Greece.3. Greek Extremists.There is little labour unrest. Workmen are earning good wages and Trade Unionists are, for the most part, moderate.Since the March strikes the workers of the; Piraeus have been reacting against the Bolshevik minority. The Executive of the Workmen&apos;s Centre has issued a communique, disowning &quot; Rizospastis,&quot; the organ of the Extremists, and appealing to workmen to show no favour to Bolshevism. The Government have been pursuing their stern policy against the Socialists in Macedonia and have arrested many.   They have also threatened to suppress the centre at Kavalla.The Greek Extremist Party, which already adheres to the Third International, is advocating a Balkan Labour League, of which Racovinski, a Bulgar, is to be the representative at the next Inter-national Socialist Conference. Such representation bespeaks the little popular support of the Movement.About 4,600 Russians of Bolshevik proclivities, probably part of the Russian contingent withdrawn from the line in France in 1917, recently arrived at Salonika from that country. They have apparently attempted no Bolshevik propaganda.6. NEAR EASTERN STATES. TURKEY.Nationalist Activities and Effect of the Allied Occupation ofConstantinople.The impotence of the new Government against the Nationalists is now clear. The Grand Vizier has relied on tAvo means of combating them : (1) Religious proscription, which might move the peasants to insistence and split the Nationalist forces ; and (2) the recognition of the anti-Nationalist fighting leader Anzavour as Governor-General. Both these methods have failed. Kemal has responded to the religious condemnation by forming his own Government, and Anzavour has been signally defeated. There is now no serious opposition to the Nationalists,Thor
The Young Turks attribute the movement against them, which is headed by Ahmed Anjuman, to British influence and support, and have sent a mission to Aleppo whose; object is believed to be the pro-motion of anti-Allied feeling among the Arabs. They are spreading a report that feeling in Germany regarding the Peace terms has reached such a pitch that a revolution has broken out, and that the new German Government has decided to support Turkey in every way.According to a report of the1 proceedings of the; Nationalist meeting at Sivas in March, the; Young Turks were then finding it difficult to obtain recruits. In Anatolia they have frequently been obliged to resort to force of arms.Since; the allied occupation e)f Constantinople, the economic situation cannot he said to have1 improved ; owing to the interruption of Railway communications with Anatolia and the1 activities of the profiteers, there has been a very marked rise in prices. The presence of the1 Allied troops and of Russian and either immigrants eloes not, naturally, alleviate the situation, for which the population, however, was, until recently, inclined to blame the Young Turks. The; latter are trying to make anti-British propaganda out of incidents connected with the Allied occupation. Wild tales of British atrocities are being circulated and photographs have been taken of the bodies of Turkish rowdies, who were killed at Sheikh-Zade Bashi. Cinematograph pictures to be shown as depictions of British brutality were also taken of an unruly crowd outside the passport offices at Galata, as it was being dispersed by the Military police.A paper called &quot; El Lev/a El Tarabolsia &quot; which is being published in Tripoli by Giovanni Martini, an Italian, and an ex-officer of the Egyptian Coast Guard Service, Abu Shadi, is being distributed in Constantinople. Its tone is Pan-Islamic and anti-Christian but particularly anti-British and anti-French, It has a considerable sale among Tripolitans in Turkey and also, more generally, among Nation -Nationalists.  Its funds come from Italy.Mustapha Kemal and the Nationalists.While Turkish Nationalists in Switzerland are considerably alarmed by events in Constantinople, Djavid Bey, the Turkish ex-Minister of Finance, thinking the Entente would never succeed in coming to an amicable settlement over the partition of Turkey, expressed himself as little disturbed by the occupation of Constantinople. Djavid declared that Mustapha Kemal would never give way, and stated that he was of opinion that the Entente would never be able to send enough troops to subdue the country. Djavid was certain, probably for propaganda purposes, that the Young Turks would have the moral support of the whole of the Moslem world in their struggle against the Entente.It is reported that in Constantinople the general opinion early in April appeared to be that the Nationalist movement in Anatolia could not continue for very long owing to want of munitions and the bad morale of the troops, who were said to be tired of fighting.Even in the light of recent events it does not yet appear whether facts will bear out the view expressed by Djavid Bey, or the view just given. Both may have their modicum of truth. The provisions of the Treaty will undoubtedly tend to obliterate differences amongst the Nationalist leaders, but may not animate in the same degree the troops on whom they are bound to depend, while the opportunist unbelievers who hold the reins of the Young Turk Party are not likely to be able really to enlist the sympathies of &quot; the whole Moslem world.&quot;   Much
appears to depend on the firmness of the Entente For, the provisions of the treaty once known, any vacoillation in their application- will both weld together the Nationalist power and gain adherents for Mustapha Kemal,Enver Pasha, who was recently reported to be at Moscow, is now said to have arrived at Baku, where a mixed Russo-Tartar Force 50,000 strong is said to be concentrating against Georgia and Batum, with the intention of joining hands with Mustapha Kemal. Support from this quarter, linking up the Nationalists in Anatolia with the mass of Soviet Russia, is likely to do much to harden the resistance of the Nationalists to pressure by the Entente.Islam and Bolshevism Two Absolutes.In an interview early in March Hedja At if Effendi, a leader of &quot; Taali-i-Islam Jemiete &quot; was reproved by the Sheikh-ul-Islam for a recent anti-Bolshevik proclamation issued by his Society. The Sheikh-ul-Islam stated that it was wrong to be antagonistic to Bolshevism as Turkey would surely derive benefit from its influence. The Turkish Nationalist Delegation which recently arrived in Constantinople via Baku is said to have come with the object of obtaining a &quot; Fetwah &quot; in favour of a fusion of Bolshevism and Islamism from the Shcikh-ul-Islam and the Ulema of Constantinople.A report received from Constantinople states that the most in-fluential of the theological professors are taking a large part in the spreading of Pan-Islamic-cum-Bolshevik propaganda. A mission of theological students under the leadership of the Revolutionary poet Akif Bey, was recently sent to Anatolia to this end.Unification of Pan-Islamic Propaganda.Certain Pan-Islamic leaders in Constantinople including, among others, Dr. Essad Pasha, the Red Crescent leader, have initiated a scheme for internationalising the entire Moslem Press under the direction of the Khalif and the Sheikh-ul-Islam. The adhesion of the Shams Press in Constantinople, already notorious for its Pan-Islamic publications, has been secured and the promoters hope to obtain the co-operation of similar organs in Egypt and Persia. Briefly, the object of this scheme, which is so far unknown to the Sultan or the Sheikh-ul-Islam, is to unify Pan-Islamic propaganda under Turkish direction. Friction between the various nationalities to whom the welfare of Islam was a secondary consideration, is responsible for the creation also, of a new pan-Islamic Committee in Switzerland, which will unite all such committees, the Turkish, the Egyptian, the Persian, etc., previously constituted on natioal lines. The new organisation is to be purely Mohammedan and non-national.Mouvahidin Society.According to a report of a meeting of the Mouvahidin Society which took place at Angora on February 21st, the Syrian branch of this Society was to meet at Damascus on March 11th and proclamations of the usual kind were to be issued. It was also reported that a number of the most important Kurdish troops had informed the Society that they were ready to take military action against the Christian Govern-ments on orders from the Society&apos;s headquarters. It appears that one branch of the Mouvahidin Society has been established at Tunis and
others in Algeria. A Society called &quot; Kavkasia Taali-i-Islam Jemiete,&quot; which is under the leadership of Said Tahir and Dr. Ali Bey Husainoff of Baku, was founded in Constantinople in March with the object of strengthening the relations between the Caucasian Muslims and the Turks.Turkish Nationalists and the Caliphate Deputation.The Indian Caliphate Deputation was reported early in April to he making strenuous efforts to get into touch with leading men in Turkey. It was even rumoured that the Mussulman Congress of India, which this delegation represents had forwarded  18,000 to the Commander of the Turkish Nationalist Forces, in the conviction that these forces have had for their object the defence of the Turco-Islamic Union. Turks in Switzeland were reported in April to be in direct communication with Mohammed Ali and the Khalifat Delegation. Mohammed Ali&apos;s presence in Europe is due in part at least to the Turkish Nationalists, who urged him to remain and direct Pan-Islamic and anti-British propaganda. They were reported in April to have guaranteed the necessary funds both for himself and his work, and were, in the event of his declining to remain in Europe, to ask him to undertake the Indian side of the agitation.7. CENTRAL ASIATIC STATES. CENTRAL ASIA.*We have indications that early in February the Soviet Authorities in Moscow were much disquieted by the double-faced policy of Kabul and the growing influence of the British there, with consequent in-acceptable demands addressed to the Bolsheviks by the Afghans. All these were apparently reported to the Soviet Authorities from Tashkent: from the same information they seem to have been afraid also of an alliance between Bokhara and Britain.A month later they learnt apparently direct from Suritz at Kabul that a new orientation had been given to Afghan policy, and about the middle of April they proposed to enter into an agreement with the Afghans, probably anti-British in effect, and stipulating that neither side should enter into any alliance directed against the other. About this time, namely, the middle of April, the Moscow Authorities found that Eliava and Broido, their representatives at Tashkent, were not transmitting their instructions to Suritz at Kabul, but were on many points carrying out an independent policy tending towards the establishment of a Turcoman Republic and so undermining the whole structure of Ail-Russian foreign policy as conceived by the people&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, more particularly in Persia. The idea of a Turcoman Republic seems to have originated with Broido, and he Avas sent by Eliava to Khiva, thus in the view of the Soviet Government hindering the realisation of its Mussulman policy.A report has been received that a new school for Eastern Propa-ganda, possibly intended to take the place of the Moscoav Moslem Bureau recently closed down, has been opened at Tashkent and that agitators are being trained there for propaganda work in India. The report is not recent: a fact which may affect the validity of the information.* A Special Report regarding the Bolshevik amps ftrtat in Transcaucasia is being prepared and will shortly be issued,e
8. FAR EASTERN STATES. JAPAN.The Japanese Home Office have now a special Department to deal with the spread of communist theory and propaganda in the country.The authorities arc apparently anxious about the situation, and are resorting to strong repressive measures, not only against Extremists but against moderate Labour leaders. Foreigners are to be more; strictly supervised. Strikes are many, and generally result in an in-crease in wages and a consequent increase in the cost of living. The platform of labour in Japan at present appears to include universal suffrage and the right to form Labour Unions.CHINA.According to the Moscow Wireless a Chinese delegation has arrived in Soviet Russia to open up diplomatic and trade relations with the Bolsheviks.   A special trade Mission is also being sent to Tashkent.Negotiations arc said to be afoot for an Italian loan to China for the purchase of submarines and arms. Colonel Varalda, tlx; Com-mandant of the Italian Legation Guard at Peking, is the agent in the Negotiations, which, it is believed, will prove abortive.SIBERIA.An agreement between Semenoff and the Japanese on the Mon-golian question was reported in February. The former was to obtain recruits among the Buriats in Mongolia and cause trouble to the Chinese in that country. Recruits were to be trained by him and to serve with him for six months, when they were to be replaced by others and to take their weapons a rifle and 500 rounds of ammunition per man, with a machine gun for every ten men home with them. The idea was that when they returned to Mongolia they Avould fight the Chinese for their independence. All expenses were then said to be paid by the Japanese.Semenoff is reported to be still at large and supported both by Chinese and by Mongolians. He has indeed been receiving arms, but from an unknown source, now stated pot to be Japanese.9. BRITISH COLONIES. CANADA.Not only was May Day quiet, but it seems to have had a beneficent effect on some of the smaller strikes which have been vexing Eastern Canada. The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; reports that an attempt has been made to secure British labour to blackleg the Toronto moulders who came out on May 1st, 1919, in favour of an eightdiour day and other reforms. The International Moulders&apos; Union has issued a warning to British moulders against going to Canada for this purpose.In the cities of Winnipeg, Montreal, and Sydney, May Day was devoted to protests against the imprisonment of.the leaders of the now famous Winnipeg strike, and the Toronto District Trades Council passed a resolution in favour of an appeal to the Privy Council for the men&apos;s release. Mr. J. H. Trueman, K.C., of Winnipeg, is, it is said, now on his way to London, to make a personal application for leave to appeal against the conviction.  The &quot;Bradford Pioneer&quot; of the
16th April contained a letter by J. Kavanagh, President of the British Columbia Federation of Labour and a prominent member of the One Big Union (see April report), asking that British donations towards the expenses of the trial should be paid to Sydney Gage, representing the Winnipeg Workers&apos; Defence Committee. Kavanagh, who is now in England, is described as a persistent and violent agitator, possessing unusual powers as a speaker. It is reported that he intends to meet the Parliamentary Labour Party and to induce them to urge the British Government to use its influence to dissuade the Government of Canada from its present policy of antagonism to the Winnipeg strikers. Kavanagh, it is said, will also attempt to induce Liverpool clock labourers to boycott Canadian produce until either the trials are dropped or the prisoners released. Kavanagh himself is an old soldier of the King&apos;s Boyal Rifles who left with an exemplary discharge but was subsequently embittered by difficulty in obtaining work.The Press is now advocating an increase of salary for teachers, of whom there is a serious shortage, to compensate the cost of living. The Canadian Veterans an; demanding an increase of soldiers&apos; gratuities or the resignation of the Government. The obverse of such demands is the news that the firm of F. W. Fearman &amp; Co. of Hamilton, one of the oldest pork packing houses in Ontario, has decided to give up business owing to the cost of material and labour and that similar losses have compelled the &quot; St. Catherine&apos;s Journal&quot; of Ontario to suspend publication.Anti-German feeling has found expression in a Bill brought forward by Senator Stanton, which requires that all firms trading in goods made by the late enemy should display a sign &quot; Dealing in German goods,&quot; on their premises and on their stationery. Many Senators approve the Brill in principle, but there are doubts whether such ameasure can be enforced.The adverse rate of the exchange with America has, it appears, cans cl some anti-American feeling, and it is even said that in some districts posters have been exhibited advising Canadians not to buygoods from America.The Irish Canadian National League held a National Demonstration on April 26th, when a mass was said for the souls of those who died in recent years for Ireland. Men executed in connection with the Easter rising in Ireland in 1916, and the late Alderman MacCurtain, Lord Mayor of Cork, were mentioned by name. Efforts are being made to extend the Irish Canadian National League and its activities.Thirty-five thousand Jews of Toronto have held a demonstration to testify their loyalty to the British Empire and their gratitude for its acceptance of the Palestine mandate.AUSTRALIA.Labour and Capital are likely to come to a quarrel on the question of shorter hours. Employers throughout Australia, it is said, are determined to oppose to the uttermost direct action designed to secure a 40-hour week, and Melbourne builders have already announced their decision not to employ men unless they agree to work for 44 hours. Mr. Hughes declares that if the building employees insist on a 40 hour week, the Repatriation Department must discontinue building soldiers&apos;The timber workers have laid a claim before the Arbitration Court at SoZe for a 44-hour week, and Judge Higgins, who is hearing thecase^s^gested that delegates of the employers and the trade
unions, together with the representative of the Federal Government should appear before him to discuss making 44 hours into the standard week. The majority of the Unions have already pledged themselves to reduce the week to 44 hours, and Mr. Hughes intends to convene a conference of employers and employees in Melbourne to promote industrial peace.In order to assist discharged soldiers to establish co-operative industries the Government proposes to contribute an equal amount to that which the men may put into the business.The miners employed at the Broken Bull mines who have been on strike for nearly a year, have decided to remain out until a 30-hour week has been granted. Their decision follows on a conference which has been held between the miners and the owners at which the owners&apos; proposals for a settlement of the dispute were considered. The proposals included increased wages together with a modification of the working hours. It is estimated that the strike has resulted in the loss of over five million pounds sterling of silver.Meanwhile the agitation has provoked a curious side issue. The wives of advocates of the five day working week insist that if that arrangement comes into practice hotels must bo closed throughout the Saturday holiday. The &quot; Housewives&apos; Association &quot; which advocates increased participation by women in national activities has put in a protest against the increased cost of sugar and has won Mr. Hughes&apos; consent to its representation on the forthcoming Conference to consider the causes of industrial unrest.As a result of the passing of the Aliens Registration Bill, all aliens residing in the Commonwealth of Australia must register, failure to do so involving a penalty of  500 or six months&apos; imprisonment.The acting Prime Minister has announced that incomes of over  1,000 are shortly to be regularly published.An isolated and rather pathetic figure in Sydney is Simonoff who describes himself as Consul General of Soviet Russia, and justifies his officially unrecognised titlj by preaching revolution. Simonoff is not in the good graces of the Moscow authorities, who do not want him back in Russia and think him ineffectual where he is, an attitude in which they appear to be in virtual agreement with the Australian authorities, who are taking no steps to deport him.New South Wales.In an interview, Mr. Storey, the new Labour Premier, has set forth his views as to a &quot; go slow &quot; policy with regard to the Labour programme of his Government. He declared that the Government would only go as far as the people desired and no farther, for Labour did not aim at the demolition but rather at the reconstruction of the social structure with the consent of the electors. Mr. Storey explained that though the strength of Labour at the polls had increased, yet the Government realised they had but half a mandate, referring to the small majority which Labour enjoyed over the opposition parties.Mr. E. G. Theodore, the Premier of Queensland, was. one of the speakers at the National Convention of the Socialist Party held at New York on Saturday.An American pamphlet entitled &quot; Bond Certificate Campaign for the&apos;first loan of the elected Government of the Republic of Ireland &quot; has been prohibited by the Australian Government from entering the oountry.
The Prince of Wales was received in New Zealand with immense enthusiasm, only a few malcontents laying themselves out to create an appearance of discord. The Labour members of the Auckland Council absented themselves from the public reception held by the Prince in the Auckland Town Hall and extremist leaders attempted to use the visit to enforce their demands,Of the general outbreak of strikes threatened by the extremists, one, that of the Railwaymcn, did take place.  It was settled, however, and the Prince was able to carry out his tour.  Even whilst the strike lasted special trains were run for the Prince, who was vociferously cheered by the strike pickets and also had a warm welcome from their families. This fact is notable as indicating that whatever the extremists themselves may have desired, the men they led were in no wise disloyal to the British Throne.   It is said that there was some provocation for the men&apos;s action in that the Government had unduly postponed any serious consideration of their ease for revision of their wage scale, when rises had already been granted to the miners and dockers.Many agitators are, however, said to be in the country and the existing laws do not permit of measures being taken to deal with thorn effectively.BRITISH EAST AFRICA.A correspondent writing to the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; affirms that the tension between the European and Indian communities is becoming acute, the outstanding grievance being the franchise question. Other sources of friction arc the question of non-admission to higher grades of the Civil Service and other public offices ; the right to obtain pro-specting licences ; and the question of the methods of land transfer. The Home Authorities are held to be responsible for the present policy of &quot; racial discrimination &quot; in favour of the European population which &quot; consists largely of officials, military and missionaries.&quot;Rhodesia.The Rhodesian elections resulted in sweeping majorities in favour of the immediate application of responsible Government as opposed &apos; to representative Government, coupled with union with the South African Commonwealth.  Labour ideas were prominent.The new Legislature contains a majority of 12, who will immedi-ately demand responsible Government ; should it be refused by the Authorities, it is anticipated that the present Administration will continue for a few years providing financial difficulties can be sur-mounted.The Union of South Africa.The profiteering Bill, which Parliament tackled after the recess, led to various manoeuvreings by the different parties for political advantage. A threatened crisis was averted when, finally, the second reading of the Bill was passed by a majority of 62 to 40. The minority of 40 consisted solely of Nationalists, Labour members abstaining from voting. The net result is to strengthen the hands of the Covern-ment in pushing forward its programme. A further important result is to drive deeper the wedge which now divides the Nationalists andNEW ZEALAND.
Labour, the latter of whom greatly resent the rather ludicrous position into which the Nationalists at one time twisted them by certain proposed amendments to the Bill.The Budget has been presented to the House and shows a surplus of  2,271,000. Tins will be applied to the redemption of debt, and more especially of war advances from the Imperial Government. Mr. Burton&apos;s speech was a striking review of the buoyant trade and industrial conditions prevailing in the Union.A shadow of the Labour troubles which disturbed Johannesburg earlier in the year may perhaps be found in the action of the Tramway men of that City who lately started a lightning strike, because one conductor was suspended.10. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.1. Armed Extremists.In view of the public attention which revolutionary and semi-revolutionary movements have attracted in America, a statement of the reported approximate insurrectionary strength of the various parties of the extreme left may be of interest. Their total number of armed men is roughly 600,000. Of these 215,000 may be classed as pure extremists and 182,000 represent advanced labour. The negro rebel strength is reckoned as 100,000 ; alien groups as 50,000, and the floating criminal population, which may be calculated on to join any violent movement, is roughly 50,000.2. Communist Party and Communist Labour Party.The superficial lull which has been observed of late both in rovolu-tionary and official counter-revolutionary measures continues. Part 2 of this issue contains a special article on the Communist Party and Communist Labour Party. It is sufficient to add here that though these two parties are adopting much the same tactics as regards going underground, their attempted union is reported to have been un-successful. The effort was made by a Russian named Agurski who reached the States via Holland with money and a message from Moscow for Martens.The distinction between the two Communist bodies has also been recognised by the Secretary of Labour, a Labour man himself, Mr. Wilson, who has ruled that membership of the Communist Labour Party does not in itself render aliens liable to deportation. The Communist Party, on the other hand, Mr. Wilson has pronounced to be definitely revolutionary, and its members are so liable. (See March Report).3. Measures against Extremists.The question of the deportation of Martens is still undecided. His followers assert that should he be expelled from the country, Russia will declare an embargo on American goods and order all American citizens to leave.The probability that he will be deported has been strengthened by the result of the recent enquiry into his case by a Sub-Committee of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which may be briefly summarised as follows : The Committee finds that 1. Martens had no diplomatic status of any kind.
2. The Russian Federated Soviet Republic has never been recognised by the United States, and is not a constituted authority according to international law.3. Martens has received no recognition officially or personallyby the Government.4. Martens is a German subject and an Alien enemy. 5. Martens&apos; propaganda in the United States for the overthrow of governments is established by his own testiminy ; he continued to employ on his staff persons advocating the bringing of Bol-bolshevism to America, and he admitted to the Committee that &quot; any means which would produce this condition would be justified.&quot; The Committee considered that Martens&apos; activities in the United States had been of a nature to render him more suitable for investiga-tion and action by the Department of Justice than by the Committee of the Senate.The question of whether or not the United States shall trade with Russia and the modified plan laid down by the Government to permit individual trading (See April Report) have been met by Lenin with a demand for the recognition of his Government. A delegation of the American Socialist Party is now nearing Switzerland, where it will meet the; Swiss Socialists and then visit Russia via Germany.The New York State Assembly&apos;s ejection of its five Socialist members has been followed by two Bills for the exclusion of the Socialist Party of America, as now constituted, from the official election ballot.News has been received that the State Department refuses to permit Jean Longuet, who has proposed to make a somewhat extended tour in America, to visit the country.The American Courts have now settled the cases against Jim Larkin and Benjamin Gitlow. Gitlow, like Eugene Debs, the Socialist candi-date for the forthcoming Presidential election, has received an inde-terminate sentence of from 7 to 15 years. Larkin has been given from 5 years to 10 years&apos; hard labour. He conducted his own defence with the assistance; of Mr John 0&apos;Leary, the brother of Jeremiah 0&apos;Learj, the anti-British agitator. Larkin&apos;s claim to be Irish born appears to be without justification. A birth certificate produced at the trial proved he was born in Liverpool.Sentences which have provoked considerable hostility are those passed upon four misguided young people, Jacob Abrahams, Samuel Lipman, Hyman Lachowsky and Mollie $timer, for the publication and distribution of leaflets, urging that pressure should be brought to bear upon the Government to oblige the Allies to raise the Blockade on Russia. The three boys were sentenced to twenty years&apos; imprison-ment, and the girl, &quot; a determined young rebel &quot; of 20, to fifteen years. Two of the Supreme Court Justices dissented from their brethren who sustained the verdict of the trial court, one of them, Mr. Justice Holmes, recording his belief &quot; that the defendants were deprived of their rights under the Constitution of the United States.&quot;The Department of Justice has also been examining Andrea Salsedo, alias Tony Tazio, implicated in the bombing outrages of last June. Salsedo terminated the proceedings by committing suicide.4. Aftermath of the Railway Strike.By April 19th the Railway officials were able to announce that all but a few of the strikers had returned to work after the lightning f; outlaw &quot; strike. It is estimated that the Railway strike cost the public  1,200,000 a day.  This is additional to the Government loss
of  25,000,000 sterling on its guarantee in regard to&apos; the earning capacity of railways, to cover which deficit Congress has voted a sum of  30,000,000. As long as the strike lasted there was a good deal of unemployment amongst factory hands in the Middle West. The Middle West State of Kansas has lately passed a drastic anti-strike law, which is claimed already to have prevented stoppages and to have increased output. The new law prescribes as a misdemeanour, liable to fine or imprisonment, the ordering of or participating in any strike which interferes with the transport or the supplies of fuel, food or clothing of the community. As regards disciplinary action by the Rail Road Brotherhoods against their rebellious followers, the &apos;&apos; Daily Herald &quot; states that the Brotherhood of Trainmen has revoked the charters of nine local bodies whose members participated in the unauthorised railway strike, the revocation affecting at least 2,000 men. Meanwhile, the transfer of the railways to private ownership has proceeded, a definite set-back to Radical hopes, the Act of Restoration showing a minute care for the rights of private property.5. Wages and the Cost of Living.The high wages recently granted in certain industries are said to tend to reduced activity in the Trades concerned, and in some quarters there are forebodings of an economic crisis.Living still grows dearer and the public temper testier and more uneasy. The Railway workers have demanded a minimum annual wage of  500, which Mr. Lauck, of the Railway Brotherhoods says is barely sufficient to maintain a working family in &quot; decent poverty.&quot; The &quot; overall campaign &quot; has been extensively advertised, and has reached the Argentine, not to speak of London. The Chicago Uni-university Club has abolished shirt collars as well.6. Strikes: De Valera and Sinn Fein, etc.To thwart the van drivers of New York who are refusing to handle goods from places where strikes and lock-outs are in progress, certain merchants are proposing to purchase and run ex-Government vans and trucks, eschewing Trade Unionist Labour. Quite recently it was said that no fewer than 14,500 men employed in various capacities at the docks, as well as 20,000 van drivers, were on strike. From Florida there is news that cigar makers to the number of 13,000 men have come out in order to enforce their demand for Union recognition.The decision of the Washington Labour Conference of October last recommending a 48-hour week is now being considered by the Inter-national Labour Bureau in its application to Seamen. A report by a Committee of Experts will be submitted to the next Labour Conference in Genoa next June.- With the idea of promoting union and mutual understanding and forbearance, the American Red Cross has established an Information Service to explain the Governments aims to persons of alien birth who do not understand English, and to instruct English speaking Americans regarding the foreign communities in their midst.The first celebration to be held in San Francisco in honour of the Irish Republic took place at the Valencia Theatre on the 21st April, 1920. The usual&quot; high-falutin &quot; rubbish was talked. Praise was given to the Irish Navy ! Apparently a sense of humour is lacking in these people, &quot; who talk a great deal but prefer to leave the dirty work to others.
Do Valera still continues to make friends and enemies up and down the country.   On the one hand, the City of New Orleans has granted him its Freedom and the; Loyola University the degree of Doctor of Laws ; on the other, a mass meeting in the City of Alabama passed a strong protest against the indulgence of his activities. The Methodists of New York have placed on record their disapproval of American support of Sinn Fein ; and other Free Churches are passing similar resolutions.  Certain members of Congress still concern themselves with affairs in Ireland and a protest signed by 02 Democrats and 26 Republicans, regarding the imprisonment without trial of persons arrested in Ireland for political offences, has been sent to Mr. Lloyd George.  Still, that, on the whole, anti-British feeling may be dying down is the view of, among others, Mr. Edward Price Bell, London correspondent of the &quot; Chicago Daily News,&quot; who has written to the London &quot; Times &quot; describing tin; growing impatience in the United States with the &quot; Sinn-Fein-Hun-Hearst&quot; agitators and all their works.Feeling against England is more bitter in the west than in the east of the United States. The picture of the Prince of Wales, shown at a &quot; movie &quot; show in New York was cheered. At San Francisco the same picture was loudly hissed.Many houses in San Francisco have a notice in the window, &quot;I,   X.Y.Z.  have purchased an Irish Liberty Bond value X dollars.&quot;Attempts to form an American Brigade for the service of Lithuania are still reported. The Brigade, it is said, will be compose! of lithuania-anians in America and Americans of Lithuanian descent. The two men concerned with the scheme are J. .J. Bielskis and Lazdynas. The Authorities made short work of their former organisation in Washington. Lazdynas is now in Kovno and Bielskis probably in London, trying to enlist men and raise funds for Lithuanian propaganda. A report has also been received that the American Merchant Fleet is trying to get Russian Naval Officers.11. CENTRAL AMERICAN STATES. MEXICO.The Revolution in Mexico, which Carranza himself is believed to have started in the Province of Sonora for political purposes, quickly spread through the country. It resulted in the fall and ultimate murder of Carranza. Some years ago President Wilson gave his sup-port to Carranza and refused to recognise General Huerta, who sought the Presidency after being implicated in the brutal murder of President Madero.   Carranza returned Presidents recognition by consistentlyflouting the United States.The Revolution was for a time described as &quot;the most bloodless in the history of Mexico,&quot; a definition apparently not intended to cover the wholesale slaughter of political prisoners in Santiago prison, which was the epilogue to the Carranza regime, and is said to have included15 Mexican Generals.The famous bandit, Francisco Villa, has laid down his arms and promised to retire from Mexican Politics. It is hoped that the new regime may establish a more liberal policy towards foreign capital.Luis Gonzales, described as a director of an artillery foundry, is reported to have sailed for Europe in February bearing a letter of recommendation from J. B. Loss, Vickers&apos; agent in Mexico, to the English firm.   It is believed that Gonzales has been commissioned
by the Mexican Government to buy war material and that Loss has assured Gonzales that Vickers will now give credit providing they are paid for what they have already supplied.12. SOUTH AMERICAN STATES. ARGENTINE.In the April report increased activity amongst extremists was described as reasonably attributable to discontent in the Police Force at Buenos Aires. Matters have now improved. The Police movement has sub-sided and the men are more; zealous in the suppression of anarchism. Two hundred Bolsheviks were arrested during the raids in March, when elaborate plans for a revolutionary outbreak were discovered, The document showed that control of the streets was to be secured by large numbers of chauffeurs and carters who. at dusk, would turn their vehicles into barricades. All public services would at the same time be cut, and terrorism let loose. Lists had been distributed giving the names of prominent persons who were to be murdered.Sporadic outrages actually did break out about the same; time in the provinces; telephone; wires were cut and the railway bridge at Rosario-Mendoza was blown up. Other attempts to derail trains and bomb attacks on factories and private houses arc reported. Three of the revolutionary ringleaders, A .Column, M. Barrajon and F. Protta were said to have beeen in touch with numerous agents in the country districts, as well as with men of the convict class. It is satisfactory to note that the authorities are now believed to have the provinces as well in hand as Buenos Aires itself.The Argentine Government has instructed the Minister at Monte Video to initiate negotiations for framing a Convention with reference to the control of immigrants, the idea being to prevent the arrival of agitators. In addition to the Argentine and Uruguay it is hoped to extend the Convention to Brazil, Chili and Paraguay,Brazil.It is reported from Lisbon that the Brazilian Government has arrested over a thousand persons of Bolshevik tendencies for having created Labour tremble. Many of the prisoners are foreigners and will be deported.   Europe will doubtless have the benefit of them.Chile.Senor Luis Manuel Rodriguez, who represented Chile at the Inter-national South American Police Conference which is being held in Buenos Aires, incurred the odium of the Argentine Press for the drastic character of the anti-extremist recommendations which he laid before the Conference. The underlying motive which led to the holding of the Conference was anxiety amongst the South American States about the immigration of subversive agitators. Chile has adopted the Argen-tine measure which requires from immigrants not only medical and police certificates but a thumb print on the passport. Besides this check on the visits of foreign agitators, the Chilian authorities are firm and foreseeing on the approach of disorders and it was their measures-ures, laid by the Chilian delegate before the Conference, which roused the ire of the more easy-going Argentinos.The Conference, it is reported, has accepted the Argentine proposal for an annual interchange of visits bctAvecn the police officials of the different South American States.
Guatemala.The Revolution has been successful and PresidentUbimte fallen.   An armistice signed between, the contending fac - condition that President Cabrera shall leave the countiy.  bcnoiCOnCUtlon tnai- rresmeiiu ^mw^^. ------ PWairlrmnviarlos Herrera, the Opposition leader, has assumed the liou cy nd Don Luis P. Aquiere has been given the portfolio of Horeigna. (and AffairsPeru.The Peruvian Government has issued a decree providing for financial assistance for immigrants. At the same time emphasis is laid on the fact that their identity and bona (ides must be; established. Passports must bear the finger prints of the immigrant and his family. The establishment of identity by means of finger prints is already in practice in the Argentine, and has, as noted above, been adopted by Chile.San Salvador.A Bill has been passed by Congress proposing the creation of an Arbitration Court in Latin America. In view of the relationship of the United States to the South American Republics it is perhaps significant that the Bill omits the former from a place in the Arbitration Court.13. WEST INDIES (cuha).Two bomb outrages are reported from Havana and May Day was celebrated by a strike of transport workers who threatened a 72-hour stoppage.Sta. Lucia.During February there was unrest in the island of Sta. Lucia, the first body to be affected was the Police ; about 30 per cent, of the younger men struck for an increase of 15 per cent, in their wages. These were dismissed, and loyal men will have a special bonus of  5. During the short time the Police was affected, the strike wave involved coal carriers, bread boys, crews of Government steamers and the em-ployees of the Castries Town Board. The Administrator of the Island asked for a British man-of-war. On her arrival all returned to work.The trouble would appear to be racial rather than economic. The authorities trace the disturbances to an organisation of agitators, the leader of whom, Norville, is a native of Demarara, and connected with the Universal Negro Improvement Association. A local contribution of 3d. per week is already being collected from the labouring classes in Sta. Lucia, ostensibly to support Marcus Garvey&apos;s Black Star Line, but also in aid of revolutionary efforts. Secret meetings are being held and one or two of the police have been abettors. The propaganda has made the natives markedly truculent toward the authorities.From the Barbadoes press it appears that large tracts of fertile land in Santa Lucia remain undeveloped, so that the labourers, at-tracted by higher wages, are emigrating to Cuba. The press urges more thorough development as a remedy.-
part if.A SOVIET ENVOY IN PARIS: IVI. DEGOTT.A circular from the Government of Moscow addressed in antieipa-tioii of the 1st of May, to the Groupe Communiste Internationale at Geneva, contains the following passages :. . . &quot; The masses will soon rise against the exploiters of &quot; their class and that rising will see our irresistible military power &quot; overwhelming Capitalistic Europe.&quot; It is primarily in Prance that Socialists and Syndicalists &apos;&apos; ought to make a determined effort to gain power. We believe &quot; that within a few weeks the tactics of Jouhaux and his band in &quot; the C.G .T. will be realised and they will be chased from authority. &quot; Then the French workers will lead a revolution, and the French &quot; Socialist Party will have realised their ambition.. . . &quot; At Paris work for the Revolution must be rapid &quot; and sure. A handful of men are doing wonderful work in &quot; France but they cannot advance far in face of the Socialist and &quot;&apos; Syndicalist chiefs . . . These lying and false leaders should &apos;; be attacked by any means. . . . Should a Revolution arise &quot; in the agricultural and industrial country of France, it will &quot; prove the powder train which will in turn ignite all Europe. &quot; Italians and Germans would no longer fear France ; the Span-&quot; iarcls would join the movement; the English would be forced &quot; to follow, after perhaps a period of hesitation. France, half &quot; agricultural and half industrial, is a highly suitable country to &quot; essay a rational communist experiment in uniting Communist &quot; agriculture and Communist industry.&quot; That is why the Communists are carefully considering the &apos;&quot;&apos; possibilities of a successful revolution in that country.   That is &quot; why, moreover, the Government of Moscow has just added to &quot;its Budget for foreign propaganda a new and special chapter &quot; for secret propaganda in France.&quot; That these words were in intention at least no empty threat became clear when the President of the Workers&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Councils at Moscow, and one time President of the Soviet Government in Odessa, M. Degott, arrived in Paris incognito on April 10th, by means of an etat civil given by the Russian Consul at Stockholm.   Degott arrived accompanied by several delegates and members of the Soviets a.t Moscow.   His presence was first discovered on the 13th April at a meeting of the Confederation Generale du Travail.    He was taken about by the important extremists, Loriot and Monatte, and by Russians residing in Paris.Degott has rented a villa at Vaucresson. The French have sure information that he is in possession of one million five hundred thousand roubles in gold. This money has entered France by way of &apos;Holland and Brussells at different times within the last two months.&apos; It is not known how it passed the French frontier undetected, but it must have come in small packets or with various persons.A certain Chernin is suspected of supplying him with funds. This man has a bank at No. 22 Rue Caumartin and his private address is 6 Avenue Malakoff.Degott came to France to organise the May Day celebrations throughout the country. He came prepared either to further the revolution or to treat with the French Government as occasion should serve.    The secrecy of their entry into France was not of Degotfs
and his followers&apos; choosing and he and his colleagues propose, if more violent methods fail, to enter later on into relations with the French Government.Tchicherin has written officially to M. Millerand submitting the Soviet Government^ conditions of peace, but he makes no reference to Degott. It is made plain, however, in his despatch, that delegates from the Soviet Government can arrive at Paris very quickly if required. Degott holds letters accrediting him the representative of the Soviets, but he prefers to get into touch with the Socialist leaders before; meeting members of the French Government, for he will only treat with the latter when he has decided that a revolution in France is impossible.Degott has announced that he will attend the International Congress of Ex-Soldiers at Geneva, where Russian delegates will appeal to all able-bodied men in Capitalist Europe to rise in revolt against those who caused and were responsible for the war. This identifies him with the violence of men like Raymond Levbure who, at a meeting of the Parti Socialiste in Paris in the middle of April declared himself for &quot; 12 bullets in the skin of M. Poincare &quot; and said he would do the same to Lloyd George, Clemenceau, Orlando and others who &quot; caused the war.&quot; Lefebvre hoped soon to see Councils of Workers and Soldiers sitting at London, Paris, Rome, etc., to judge and sentence the men then about to assemble at San Remo.Degott is constantly at the headquarters of the Confederation Generale du Travail and French Socialist Party. He has perused their dossiers and examined their respective plans in case of a revolu-tion and has offered his advice on certain points. Deference and earl nest attention are shown to him. - Conferences with the Confederation Generale du Travail leaders and with Loriot continued up to the eve of the 1st May.It is stated, though reservations on the point should probably be made, that Krassin may join Degott in Paris, the idea being that he should compare notes with him before seeing M. Millerand, to whom Krassin&apos;s arrival is said already to have been officially announced by Tchitcherin.THE SOVIET AUTHORITIES REASONS FOR DESIRING PEACE.A further interesting report has been received from the German Trade Commission of Investigation to Soviet Russia :We were able, it runs, during our stay in Russia to obtain an inter-view with Lenin, after his return from Kasan.Lenin stated that the reason why the Soviet Army had been able to fight successfully against England, France, Japan and America, was because the Bolsheviks had- allies in those countries, namely, the organised workmen. The British and French were forced to withdraw their troops from North and South Russia, because they refused to fight against the. Bolsheviks. Lenin admitted there were still many difficulties to overcome, but the Entente was now powerless to prevent Bolshevism.We are convinced that the Soviet Government really desires peace, but now it is no longer a military necessity as it was at the time of theBrest-Litovsk Peace.The following are some of their chief reasons for desiring peace :  1. Desire to extend their activity to other spheres than warfare and to improve their economic position.   The Labour Army has not been a great success as its output has been very small, partly because the men have forgotten&apos;their former skill and
partly because their military duties interfere to some extent with their civilian work. 2. To quiet the population, which objects to conscription. 8. The change which has taken place in the personnel of the Bolshevik Army. Formerly it consisted of hordes, without discipline and officered by the men themselves, whereas to-day the Army has become well-disciplined through the number of officers of the Old Army who have joined it.This state of affairs does not altogether suit the Moscow Government. Although they require a well disciplined Army to carry on successful warfare, they have now become some-what nervous about the new spirit with which the men are instilled and which might some day threaten the Government^ power. The demobilisation of the Army appears to them to be a solution of this difficulty. 4. Peace is also desired to re-establish foreign trade and generallydevelop the resources of Russia. The trend of this report strongly confirms what has been several times advanced in this Monthly Report, the fact, namely, that the present Soviet Authorities are haunted by a fear of &quot; Bonapartism &quot; in their Army.ESTHONIA AND THE BOLSHEVIKS : GUKOVSKY&apos;S MISSION AT REVAL.Till about flu- middle of March there were three parties in Esthonia, the Right, the Middle and the Left, represented respectively by General Laidoner, Poska and Hellat. Poska&apos;s sudden and mysterious death which followed upon an acrimonious discussion with Hellat, the native extremist, and Gukovsky, the Bolshevist envoy, deprived his party of the bond that united it, so that it was practically dissolved, while Laidoner and the bulk of the senior officers of the Army, finding their positions untenable, resigned their posts.At present, therefore, there remain only two parties, Laidoner&apos;s party of the Right, and the Left, which now controls the Government. The real chief of this party, and by far the strongest personality in it, is Hellat, who, rough, ill-mannered and unscrupulous, is to all intents and purposes the instrument of the Soviet Government. He dominates his own venal Government by bribery and is believed to bo working for the incorporation of his country in Soviet Russia. At present Minister of the Interior, he proposes to take over the Ministry of War, in order to control the situation through the Army.The measures Hellat takes are largely devised in consultation with the Bolsheviks and his administration is a blurred image of theirs. The purpose of their mission at Reval under Gukovsky has hitherto been nominally commercial, but really commercial, propagandist and political.On the political and propagandist side the purport of the secret agreement concluded between Esthonia and Soviet Russia is reported to be as follows : 1. In the event of definite fighting with the Poles, Esthonia agrees to maintain a neutrality favourable to the Bolsheviks. 2. The Bolsheviks undertake to do no propaganda work in Esthonia, but have the right to appoint three agents in a port to be chosen by them (they have chosen Reval) to enable them to push their propaganda in the West.
3. In consideration of Clause 2, the Bolsheviks agree to pay the Esthonians fifteen million roubles in gold.During the negotiations the Bolsheviks are said to have explained that they did not want to Bolshevise Esthonia but wanted an open gateway to the West, through which they could distribute their propa-ganda. The Esthonians agreed that what might happen in the West did not matter to them, They did not want Bolshevism in England at present, but if Bolshevism took bold in the West they would be prepared to accept it in Esthonia.The Bolsheviks are reported already to have violated their under-faking to eschew propaganda in Esthonia, where in point of fact such propaganda is being carried out among the sailors and workmen.Cukovsky regards Esthonia as politically helpless and its absorp-tion as a matter of weeks. It is not worth while; to worry much now about political matters or to awake suspicion in the minds of the Es-tbonians, since, when the time comes, Esthonia will turn Bolshevik at a touch. Cukovsky regards the country as important only from the point of view of transport.The political and propaganda side of its mission being thus accom-plished the delegation addresses itself to economic questions. The delegation is trying to get all it can (1) out of Esthonia, and (2) out of Scandinavia and in Europe. The delegates are most anxious to have as much merchandise; as possible when navigation is opened through Reval to Petrograd and before1 new developments ejecur in the summer.On the spot the1 eklegates are hot getting much. The; gooels in Esthonia imported on transit licences are&quot; said to be; too few to be of much use;, Scp, the manager e)f the Department tor purchasing foreign gooels in the Esthonian Ministry eif Traele; panel Industry, secured the cancellation of licences received for transit of goods already in the Reval Custom House Stores, so that new permits have^ to be obtained for the advance sale of transit goods, which must fulfil the regulations prescribed for local sales. In short, documentary evidence of absence of speculative gain must be produced. Gukovsky has been offered mainly sole leather, calicoes, chemicals, tinned foods and tools, as well as a certain amount of narrow gauge1 railway material. Purchases from abroad are much more important. Cukovsky has had many notable offers panel has been the intermediary in several important commercial transactions between Soviet Russia and the outer world, relating, of course, mainly to rolling stock panel industrial and agri-cultural machinery. Prominent among them are his negotiations in April with a representative of Morgan&apos;s (U.S.A.) for the delivery of locomotives variously stated as a total of 5,000 or as 300 or 400 a month for an unspecified number of months. It is believed that early in these transactions, Gukovsky pointed out the anomaly of trading with a country whose government you do not recognise, and that the Director of the Locomotive Company was sympathetic. The American Government, however, seemed in April inclined to temporise, and Litvinoff in particular is said to have urged his Government to taunt the Americans, through Gukovsky, with being led by the nose by the British into absurd and hysterical hostility to the Soviet regime, and to offer them financial and commercial concessions as a bribe.Another prominent deal in which Gukovsky appears to have been the intermediary in February and March, was the exchange of Russian wood and iron for oil from Baku, a deal in which, through a good deal of obscurity, a connection with recent events in Azerbaijan may perhaps be traced. Timber, etc., was to go to Baku via the Volga and As-trakhan,
In the peaceful penetration of Soviet Russia through Esthonia, Great Britain has her place. Until the middle of April the idea of a British Bank for Esthonia and Soviet Russia appears to have held&apos; the ground. Later, however, the suggestion (more acceptable to the Bolsheviks as giving them wider scope to enter into trade relations with the rest of the world) of opening a credit with a London bank against payment in gold at Reval, seems to have entered the field, if not to have superseded the original scheme, The effect of these transactions has been to produce the impression at Reval that the British are in a hurry.Meanwhile it is stated from Reval that the commercial agents of the Bolshevilc Delegation add 10 per cent, to their bills for their own profit and divide the proceeds with the Bolshevik Commissars.Gukovsky makes transportation to Petrograd a condition in the case of all commodities, as transport is the great difficulty for the Soviet Government. He has offered to buy any amount of transport material and to pay for it in gold. Such material is needed in the following order of precedence : (1) Locomotives, (2) Permanent way, (3) Rolling stock. This corresponds with the scheme of restoration of transport facilities worked out in Moscow.RUSSIAN LAND TENURE UNDER THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT: FORMER VILLAGE COMMUNITIES AND PRESENT SOVIET FARMS.The greater part of the agricultural lands in the former Russian Empire were in the possession of the peasantry and private owners. The peasantry held their land either communally as in the centre and East, or individually : as in Western Russia. The private owners were, in order of importance, (I) the nobility, and (2) persons who had purchased their land from the Agrarian banks.The system of communal landowning extant in Central and Eastern Russia gave small hopes of improvement in agriculture. Each peasant held his land only for a term of years, after which the land belonging to the Mir or village community was again redistributed. The three-field rotation of crops was made obligatory by the majority of such communities, and the more advanced peasant had no means of improving his land without consent of the majority of his fellows. Jealousy, needless to say, often stood in the way of this consent being given.The peasants of Western Russia, owning their land individually, on the so-called &quot; farm-system &quot; (really small holdings) were thus more progressive, and able to do more with it than the village com-munes, though the sole difference in fact was that each peasant owned his land in perpetuity, no redistributions being made, other conditions (scattered plots, communal pastures and meadows, etc.) remaining the same, The first Russian revolutionists, some of whom even obtained posts in the old Government, were firm partisans of communal land-owning, thus accidentally or purposely playing into the hands of the extremist Revolutionaries, who had long agitated among the peasantry in favour of confiscation of private lands.The revolution of 1905-06 was accompanied by plunderings and burnings of private estates, but only in regions of communal land-owning.] Stolypin, the Prime Minister of that period, then initiated a series of land reforms, tending to the total abolition of communal landowning, reforms which different schools of thought regarded sever-ally as progressive and reactionary.   The premature decease of that
Minister stopped the course of reform. It is possible that if his plans had been carried out in full, the Revolution of 1917 would have found small support among peasant small-holders, who must have under-stood that an intensive development would give them better chances of prosperity than an extension of their already unwieldy farms by the requisition of private lands.The &quot; nationalisation &quot; of private estates reached its height after the October (Bolshevist) Revolution. The new leaders appealed to the baser instincts of the village proletariat, and divided up the last estates, centres of agricultural progress, whoso produce constituted the main portion of Russian exports in foodstuffs.Simultaneously the villages decreased the intensity of their cultiva-tion. The formation of the Red Armies bled the country of agri-cultural labourers, till the population of the villages was first com-penaated and then increased by numbers of civic workmen, who flocked to the villages from the starvation in the towns. These workmen had lost all touch with the soil except the legal fiction of having a right to a share of it. They hung about the villages as drones, utterly unable to take their part in cultivation, A great shortage of implements and other material, followed by mass requisitions of horses and cattle, placed the villages in a very critical condition. When even corn and other foodstuffs began to be requisitioned to feed the starving towns, the peasants countered by sowing only enough to feed themselves and their families. The towns, unable to support themselves on their own immediate neighbourhood, could bring food from no further afield by reason of the general crisis in both railway and water transport. Starvation pure and simple afflicted the cities, while the looted estates lay barren and abandoned.In the spring of 1919 &quot; Soviet Farms &quot; made their appearance. Timidity, fumbling, mistakes, and hesitation characterised their organ-isation. No definite system was adopted, Those estates not taken over by the State still remained at the disposal of the Regional Land Committees, which strove to organise &quot; agricultural communes &quot; on them. These latter have had a sorry experience. Owing to the lack of technically skilled workers, the Regional Land Committees were unable to control the Communes&apos; activities or to suggest measures to increase the yield of the farms. The lack of convinced Communists gave rise to great disorder. An &quot; agricultural commune &quot; was usually formed by starving people from the towns, who, having &quot; liquidated &quot; or rather devoured, all stocks of foodstuffs still remaining on the estate, immediately dissolved its organisation. Few farms were passed over to the State ; still fewer were worked by &quot;agricultural communes.&quot;The remainder of the land was held in reserve for the increase of peasant allotments and a large area was seized by the peasants themselves, who tilled the land taken from the estates, which was of better quality than that which they abandoned. In the now prevalent and for a long time to come inevitable lack of horses, implements, fertilisers and manure, the land thus seized must, however, inevitably deteriorate. Then the present peasant proprietors will find themselves in exactly the same case as before.The presence of responsible persons, who hold in check the appetites of the local proletariat, renders the state of the &quot; Soviet farms &quot; better than that of the estates left at the disposal of the Rural and Regional Land Committees, on which it is common to find neither implements nor stock, nor frequently indeed a single living soul.The organisation of the Soviet farms commenced with the establish-inent of Regional and District Administrations, with various sub-
departments, such as production, supply, distribution, finance and control. A Committee of Bolshevists was at the head of each such Administration.Then red tape came into its own. Staffs for administrative offices were found without much difficulty, hunger (hiving many people to them. Each estate was managed by a Technical Adviser, by whose side sat a Political Commissar. There were thus two heads on each estate, constantly in conflict with one another. The Technical Ad-visers won the day and the Commissars were finally removed.The Management of the farm was now entrusted to the Technical Adviser and a Committee of Workmen on the estate. This meant that dualism of authority was maintained with an increased surface for friction. Regional Committees suspected their subordinates and one another in an atmosphere of distrust and a tangle of red tape, the latter being a special impediment to the supply of implements and stock.As two recommendations from members of the Communist Party were required for the appointment of every Technical Adviser, it proved extremely difficult to find skilled agriculturists for the business, and in fact, the majority of such &quot; advisers &quot; were and are former gardeners, cattlemen, etc., with neither the special not the [general education necessary for their work.The workmen were for a time in better case. They received free housing and rations for themselves and their families, with an 8-hour working day. Not for long, however. Presently the working day was altered to 11 hours, and though the added three were paid at overtime rates with 50 per cent, increase, the benefit to the workmen Was small, money having by this time lost all value in Soviet Russia. As a result, the workmen lost what heart they had to their tasks, performing them with the sloth and dilatoriness which betoken loss of incentive.Though the present Government in Russia pretends to represent &quot; Workmen and Peasants &quot; yet all workmen arc not treated alike. The Soviets discriminate openly in favour of the town workers, whom they rightly regard as politically more dangerous. Agricultural labourers, scattered among the Soviet farms, not being dangerous, are forgotten.The yield of the Soviet farms is not encouraging. They produce in most cases just enough to feed their own labourers. Money spent on them is lost. The urban population still remains without food. Possibly, were they rationally organised, Soviet farms might do some-thing towards lightening the situation in the towns. But only on condition of being no longer Soviet farms.Meanwhile several informants recently returned from Russia tell a story which throws light on the attitude of individual small holders. These have no faith in the continuance of the Soviet regime, and are extremely anxious about their ownership of the land under its successor. Not content with registration in the Soviet records, these new peasant proprietors are purchasing titles to their land from the notaries of pre-revolution days, and insist upon the documents being written upon paper with the old heading and stamped with the old seal. That the whole transaction is an infringement of the Bolshevik regulations, and is therefore always conducted in secrecy, only adds cogency to the conclusion to be drawn from its prevalence.
THE REORGANISATION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND COMMUNIST LABOUR PARTY IN THE UNITED STATES.The Communist Party of America lias now been entirely reorganised into small groups, the existence of which is known only to the National Executive Committee of the Party.   Each group of ten or twelve men, sometimes more, has a Secretary and Organiser, who is in direct communication with the National Executive Committee.   None of the members of the groups are known to members of other groups, to that Government agents, who might be in the rank and file, are deprived of the opportunity ity to give away the entire membership of the Party.   These groups are said to be a greater menace than was the whole Communist Movement before the Government raids upon the Communist Party and the Communist Labour Party took place.The plan of reorganisation is broadly a copy of that of the old Russian Revolutionary Movement. To combat such small groups is practically impossible unless the services of the main leaders of the Communist Party are obtained.On instructions from the Amsterdam Bureau of the 3rd Interna-tional a sub-bureau has been established in the United States to unite the revolutionary forces of the North, South and Central America. The establishment of the Bureau makes it possible for the revolu-tionary movement in America to receive greater financial support fromthe Third International.Definite information shows that Martens was recently possessed of about 75,000 dollars cash and about 100,000 to 50,000 dollars in precious stones, not yet disposed of. Instructions have been given by Martens to his confidential man that in case he is arrested and deported to Russia, the Soviet Government money left in this country shall be divided equally between the Communists and the CommunistLabour Party of America.Great anxiety prevailed in April amongst the leaders of the Com-munist Labour Party because of a rumour which was being spread in the inner circles of the Communists and Anarchists that on the day of May 1st, very small groups of Anarchists and former Communists intended to take extreme measures against some of the Government officials, as well as private individuals, who had made themselves conspicuous in the &quot; persecutions &quot; of the Radicals.Later information indicated that several Russians avIio participated in the Steel Strike, and suffered at the hands of the Police, had come to New York with the determination to work out plans of assassinating some of the leading owners of the United Steel Corporation. Some of them were said to be former members of the Union of Russian workers.Information appears to have reached the Authorities in time for May 1st and Mr. Michael Palmer&apos;s announcement, that the Government was taking precautions, was probably the reason that, when the time came, these precautions seemed unnecessary.It Avould be unsafe, however, to infer that all danger of terroristic acts is past. The leaders of the Communist and Communist Labour Party, who are generally opposed to Terrorism, still fear that such acts may give the Government additional reason for drastic measures, But such a fear is not shared by them all, and others think that the more drastic the Government becomes, the better for the movement, since repressive measures anger the working masses, and, by making them class-conscious, prepare their temper for a more serious upheaval.At present it is reported that the Revolutionary forces in the
United States intend to keep quiet, and later to resume their activities on bigger and more definite lines.THE SITUATION IN EGYPT.The diversity and complexity of Egypt, due to the mixture and conflict within a relatively small compass of so many races and creeds demands a sort of miniature plebiscite, or at least something like a corresponding variety among informants regard ng the state of affairs at any given moment.  The following is a general view of them based on recent information and opinions obtained from (1) Sir Alex-ander Baud, who has lived in the country for 40 years and who has a large acquaintance among Egyptians of all classes; (2) a Pasha of Turkish descent and moderate Nationalist tendencies ; (3) a Sheik who professes scholastic philosophy at Al Azhar  University and astrology outside1, panel (4) several minor informants of widely different castes panel nationalities.   Sir Alexander Baird holds that the recent collapse in administration is due to the confusion cemsequent em the war, which has, he says, led to olfieial inefficiency.   New men are called upon constantly to deal with the situation, which  n Lord Kitehener&apos;s time! would have been foreseen, and with which want of experience and sympathy has unfitted them to cope.   As the result of thirty-nine years of British rule, of promises of self-government held out, panel of an educational system encouraging self-assertion, the sub-missiveness of the people to government which existed in 1882, is now a thing of the past. We have, in fact, a new Egypt to deal with. The mistakes admittedly made with regard to recruiting for the Labour Corps panel the; collection of funds for the Reel Cross, etc., during the; war, pressing as they did on the Fellah, destroyed belief in the; justice of our rule.   These measures finally made the; peasantry hostile to British Administration for the first time since the Occupation.&quot; It was easy enough,&quot; says Sir Alexander Baird, &quot;to rule Egypt in &quot; spite of Nationalist obstruction and Effendi hostility, so long as the &quot; Fellaheen were content Avith our Government, as Avas the case until &quot; 1914. Lord Allenby&apos;s task, therefore, is much less simple than was &quot; Lord Kitchener&apos;s, a fact to be remembered in making the obvious &quot; comparison between our present failure panel our past success.&quot;This led Sir Alexaneler Baird to elescant on the outcrop of a sort of Prussianism among the more recently appointed English officials. &quot; This,&quot; he said, &quot; is no country for the Englishman out of sympathy &quot; with the Egyptians, avIio thinks that you can only govern by fear &quot; based on bayonets. Men of this type have recently done much &quot; harm. On the other hand, all Englishmen Avho understand and &quot; sympathise with the people (and among the older British officials &quot; there are not a few) are still liked panel respected. For Avhatever &quot; certain critics may have Avritten, the Egyptians Avith all their petu-&quot; lance and childishness are not Avanting in natural affection.&quot;Harshness and unnecessary evidence of the rule of force will, noAv that discontent has spread from the half-baked, semi-denationalised Effendi, who Avere once the staple of the Nationalist movement, to the Fellaheen, on whose good-Avill Lord Cromer Avas so careful to base his rule, can only call forth dislike and discontent; and these are bound to lead to further violence. Thirty years ago it Avas easy to cow the Egyptians. This, our informant says, is no longer the case, and it will take many years of Avisc gOA^ernment to recover our lost prestige, which, never based on power, was due to their respect of our sense of justice.
The opinons of a Pasha of Nationalist tendencies, and late Minister, now in touch with Saad Zaghloul, the extremist leader in Paris, are believe 1 to reflect pretty accurately the views of this class, most of whom arc, like the present Sultan, of Turkish descent. In con ersa-tion with a person of eminence of his own milieu he said that he and other moderate Nationalists were growing tired of Zaghloul&apos;s unreason-able attitude. It was plain that Egyptians neither fcould expect nor were likely to get complete&apos; independence. He himself, therefore, with other reasonable Nationalists, was prepared to make the best of whatever measure of self-government Great Britain would concede. The Army of Occupation, he considered, must remain, not necessarily as a permanent measure. He also thought that certain Brit ish advisers to Egyptian Ministers might with advantage be retained, specifying in this connection the Financial Adviser. With the advisers to the Ministries of the Interior and Education he thought they might dispense, The English, of course, would safeguard their interests in the Canal and would probably want Alexandria as a Naval Base, bid, generally speaking, it was his view that Egypt would be wise to begin her experiment in relative autonomy on such moderate lines as these, and unwise to insist, as Zaghloul was apparently insisting, on Complete independence as the one and only solution.These views are, of course, those! of the class which, since 1882, has been in continual contact with British Administrative methods. It is unlikely that they would have been expressed to anyone not of the entourage and mind of the speaker, whose public utterance would assuredly he much less moderate.    For the situation is such that prominent men of the ruling caste have to outstep their moderatism in order to come into line with the more ambitious views of the educated Egyptian Effendi, who really does want complete control of Egypt and her future, and whose aspirations have ended by giving their colour to the press and to what passes for public opinion of the country^ The fact, however, that such moderate views are held, even in conceal-ment, among men of the present ruling and land-owning caste, makes the prospect of political readjustment in a sense more hopeful.   That they may be held in self-defence, and that this class may rely upon the British Occupation for its own maintenance in place, does not diminish, but rather enhances, its value as a prop to British Administra-tion.   In this connection recent public attacks by Sir Valentine Chirol and others on the present Sultan seem curiously ill-advised.   Italianate Sultan Fouad may be, and cheaply continental in his assumed en-lightenment.   He is painfully conscious, moreover, of his unpopularity with the enemies of the Government, and hence possibly treacherous, should occasion arise, to the British cause.   But he is nevertheless representative of a class whose unity and position it is now important, from the point of view of British interests, to maintain.The views of the Al-Azharite Sheik, who is also a preacher in one of the Mosques, and an Astrologer of influence, indicate that in another quarter a little tactful encouragement might do much to foster support for British Administration. The personal complaint of this old gentle-man was that the Government offered no encouragement to learning such as his, while upon ignorant young men of the Effendi class they lavished well-paid posts, which a superficial modern education unfitted them to fill. Discontent of this particular kind in the heart of Al Azhar itself is at least interesting, especially when the difference with the Nationalist Effenclim is borne out by the old gentleman&apos;s general expose&apos; of the situation.The Sheikh ascribed the continuance of the troubles to the absence
of a singleness of mind on the part of the British Government, Egypt, he declared, could not be independent because she was too important and backward to be entrusted with her own fortunes, but although&apos; the English, as he read the stars, would go, another power would take their place until, perhaps in another hundred years, the country might be able to govern itself, The English should know, he said, that the stick is the only argument the Egyptians can understand. &quot; In this country it must still be the final instrument of Government.&quot; He then proceeded to explain that as a Sheikh, a teacher in the Azhar University, and a preacher in a Mosque, he himself had no fear of the Government, his position removing him from all such risks.Before leaving the vicinage and atmosphere of Al Azhar it has to be recorded that a qualified informant comments in strong terms on the recent attampted assimilation of the standard and type of educa-tion at that University to that of the Government schools. This V reform &quot; due to the initiative of a brother of Saad Pasha Zaghlul, the extremist leader now in Paris, is described as the last word in fatuity. An attempt suddenly to &quot; modernize &quot; a genuine mediaeval University (Al Azhar is the senior of the Sorbonne and, mutatis memorandum-tandis, has maintained in the 20th Century the likeness of a European University of the 12th), to bring into line with the free-thinking Effendi culture &quot; of the modern Egyptian University, the centre of learning to which the whole of the Islamic world looks up, was bound to exacerbate, the hostility between Moslems of the old school and the raw Agnostics of the new, and to result in further dislike of the pro-tecting power that allowed it. Meanwhile, we learn that the Scools of Medicine and Law and the Nationalist Universite Egyptienne have lost such friends as they had, are, as often as not, on strike, and cannot raise audiences even from the; class by and for whom they were created.Viewing the situation as a whole,it must be confessed that agitation, though carefully concealed and perhaps to some extent alleviated by the censorship, has rather been driven underground than stopped. Those; who know the country best doubt whether there; is any real improvement in the situation. Incidents e)f the war, including the recruiting for the Labour Corps panel the collection of funds for the Keel Cross above referred to, have shaken the; belief of Egyptians in the wisdom formerly associated with the; British methods of government, a loss of prestige increased by the reading of English newspapers by Effendis to whom education has only brought a perversity of outlook.As usual, nothing can happen which is not used as an argument against the continuance; of British &quot; tyranny.&quot; If the Egyptian land-owners grow cotton in place of wheat the British are accused of &quot; starv-ing Egypt for the sake of Manchester.&quot; If, on the other hand, it is proposed to curtail the number of Feddans under cotton and to grow more corn &quot; England is bent on ruining the wealth of Egypt for her own selfish ends.&quot;No charges is too absurd to be believed or too silly to be repeated. The other day a deputation of landowners from the country i reported to have come to Cairo to expostulate with the Nationalists responsible for the attacks on the P.W.D, and the Nile Scheme. &quot; If,&quot; they pro-tested, &quot; as you say, the English have the power of robbing Egypt of her water, for Heaven&apos;s sake don&apos;t go on exasperating them as you are doing or they will end in cutting it off.&quot;The idea that we control their water and may use it as a mean 5 of coercion is sinking into their minds. An Englishman, whose liation-ality is well hidden under a Tarbush and a gift of tongues, asked an
Egyptian who was reading an Arabic paper, for the news, explaining that he had only just landed. &quot; There is no fresh news,&quot; was the reply, &quot;the English are still robbing Egypt of her water, for Syria this time.&quot; Probably the Egyptian had seen the conduit by which water is carried to beyond Al Arcsh from the Sweet Water Canal. &quot;This work, carried out during the war, was not noticed at the time, but the wild propaganda against the Nile Projects has made the people so suspicious that they regard the miles of piping across the desert as evidence of another crime against Egypt.A curtailment of trains on Sunday instead of Friday, the day which good Moslems devote to meditation and prayer, was pointed to as another instance of the manner in which the English flout the feelings of Egyptians, the loudest protesters being Egyptian Effendis who neither meditate nor pray.To stun up, the general trend of information from many sources is to the effect that British ovorlordship in Egypt would be safest in identifying itself positively with the secular drift of affairs. The true followers of Islam and the landowners on the one hand, and on the other, though now in a modified and uncertain degree, the Fellaheen, would seem, if wisely managed, to be the classes most susceptible to sympathetic treatment. Neither Islam not the landowning class (even when! these are moderate Nationalists) like the Effendi revolutionaries, the former for religious reasons, and the latter because of their fear of the Effendi influence upon the Fellaheen. A reversion to the simple broad policy of Lord Cromer and Lord Kitchener, which lay in the upport of the latter against all comers, may be possible with time. Meanwhile, in order to rcstor 1 iheir confidence in British guardianship it would seem necessary to approach them indirectly, by encouragement to their religious teachers, by a steady, firm and just administration by men properly selected and willing to learn, and by, at all events, refraining from attacks upon the landowning classes, whose interests are, for the moment at least, identical with our own.Printed by the Beceiver for the Metropolitan Polico District, Row cotland Yard, .W. 1
