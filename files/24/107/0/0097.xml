This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET.&apos; ymTHE CABINET.GAS WARFARE.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith the observations of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on the memorandum recently submitted to the Cabinet by the President of the Board of Education (CP. 1301),w. B; c.121622The War Office,ISth June, 1920.A memorandum on the subject of gas warfare has recently been prepared by the President of the Board of Education and sent to all members of the cabinet this memorandum appears to Call for some observations from the General Staff. For instance, the following paragraph appears : As to the argument of cheapness^ all experience shows that a new development in the art of war invariably involves additional cost The cost of gas will not be a substitute but an increment.Experience shows that every war is more expensive than the last; but gas shell in the Great War proved to possess, under suitable conditions, at least two or three times the casualty producing power of ordinary shell, and, in the long run, such a weapon must be an economy. There is always a certain amount of initial cost in introducing a new weapon, but m any case this initial cost has already been borne.2. The following observations are contained in the memorandum in regard to the question of the humanity of this weapon : -(i.) That we are not yet in a position to judge of the permanent effects of gases upon the constitutions of the men who have been gassed.(ii.) That the British estimate of the comparative lightness of many of the casualties inflicted upon our Army by gas in the recent war is largely affected by the experience of mustard gas, a temporary expedient to which German military science would not again recur for the very reason that it does not inflict a sufficient proportion of major casualties.(iii.) That although it may no doubt be possible to invent painless or comparatively painless gasesj it is equally possible to discover gases whioh are even more painful than those which have hitherto been empkiyedi(ivi) That the use of poison once admitted, its extensions are infinite and so easy of employment that &quot;the populations of large cities might easily be destroyed. e.g., by the use of germs in bombs or by test tubes in water supplies, (v.) That the use of poison gas in bombing from the air is probably calculated to increase the evilsj already far too great, inflicted upon civilian non-combatants by modern warfare,As regards (i), there is little cause for pessimism in this respect; medical opinion as a whole does not anticipate that the proportion of permanent effects will be as high from gas as from ordinary wounds.As for (ii), it is not clear upon what foundation this argument is based; mustard gas was by far the most efficient gas used in the wrar, and is the first- gas in order of priority that all armies would wish to use.&apos; Major casualties are not the aim of gas warfare ; its object is to render men ineffective as combatants for a more or less prolonged period, not necessarily to kill.(B20/289)   100  6/20  HAS  8325wo
2 NMBM&apos;Regarding (iii), it is submitted that this is at present a matter of opinion, and cannot be stated as a fact.  .Sub-paragraph (iv) reveals a misconception which is very common among those who have not studied science in its relation to military problems. There is no prospect of the annihilation of the populations of lnrge cities; for every new weapon there is a counter-measure. Nations which do not study science will probably be more easily defeated in future by those which do, and for this reason alone the study of chemical warfare seems to be essential to our safety. ,   ,Poison gas and germs are two wholly separate things. The former ,has been introduced into war because it can play a major part in operations, and the latter has not because no way has so far been found of employing it as an efficient weapon, nor as one from which the army using it will not run large risks simultaneously with the enemy.Strictly speaking, all our high-explosive shell have been poison shell for more than 20 years, in that the products of the explosion contained lethal gases. As regards (v), this is true.3. There have been several cases since the war when British lives have been sacrificed owing to our refusal to use gas; a typical instance is the capture of the Afghan Fort of Spin Baldak.On this occasion we suffered 40 or 50 casualties, although if gas had been used the place might have been taken without suffering one and, incidentally, without killing a single Afghan.Mr. Fisher maintains that The use of this weapon against an uncivilized enemy possessing little or no medical equipment, is clearly open to special objections, apart fro in the psychological issues touched on in the minute of the Secretary of State for India.But the consideration of the saving of lives of our own men must weigh with us as much as the effect of this weapon on enemies who, despite the chivalry claimed for them by the Secretary of State for India, nevertheless before killing our wounded perpetrate such horrors as it is unnecessary to dwell upon here.4. The next paragraph runs as follows : It is no doubt true that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to supervise and to limit chemical research which may be undertaken in laboratories for the purpose of elaborating the art of gas warfare. It should, however, be possible to ascertain whether an army is providing itself with an expensive gas equipment, whether it is using a Manual of Gas Drill and making chemical warfare the basis of part of its regular discipline. There is no country in the world in which a million men can be made to undergo a particular kind of discipline in secret. If, therefore, the Governments of the Great Powers were to undertake to abstain from preparing chemical warfare and were to break their undertaking, the far*.t would certainly become known.There is no doubt that chemical warfare is a matter which can be studied and elaborated in secret, and in order to obtain the great advantages accruing from the element of surprise, a future enemy, could conceal his preparations by postponing the training of his troops in chemical warfare measures until the outbreak of war. In the case of a country like Germany where there is a well-organized organic chemical industry which can always become the producer of poison gas at a momenfs notice, the advantages of surprise and initiative which could thus be obtained over an adversary who had made no preparations during peace would be enormous. Though Germany failed to, reap the full benefit of the tactical success which she gained by the use of gas in 1915, contrary to the Hague Convention, it would not be safe to assume that a similar mistake would be made in another war. With our present knowledge of the potentialities of chemical warfare, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that its use against a nation unprepared and unprotected would prove a deciding factor.5. In regard to the following :-There is nothing whatever in the argument that the permanent interests of the Army .will be injured by a halt in the development of this department of military activity,it is submitted that this is one which cannot be so summarily dismissed. We maintain that the direct opposite is really the case, since scientists seeing no safe prospects of
June, 1920.employment in the Army are therefore leaving to take up other work; all touch between soldier and scientist will then be lost. Moreover, our study of gas will be injured by a halt in its development in the same way as any science or trade would be on a sudden closing down of research.6. With regard to the statement that We do not propose to embark upon another great war at present and there is plenty of time before us in which to develop this branch of chemical knowledge if it should be found necessary to do so.I am as anxious as the rest of the nation to avoid another war, but the argument that we should not develop the science of gas warfare because we ourselves do not propose to embark upon another great war, appears dangerous.  The war may be forced on us.The same might be urged in respect to the development of artillery or any other military weapon.Even if we are not prepared to use gas offensively, it is our duty to study the question from the defensive point of view, in order to provide our troops with adequate protection against an enemy who is not handicapped with scruples as to the employment of gas. It must not be forgotten that the provision of adequate protective measures requires prolonged research into both the offensive and defensive aspects of chemical warfare, and a nation which delays this research places itself at a grave disadvantage.7. I have nothing new to add to the views that I have already submitted, but I CP. 1211 feel it incumbent upon me to repeat that until the League of Nations ensures that all other nations will give up the chemical side of war, I cannot advise the Cabinet to forgo the study of .a weapon which, in the opinion of the General Staff, is necessary to safeguard; as far as is humanly possible, the safety of the Empire.Henry Wilson, Field-Marshal,Chief of the Imperial General Staff.
