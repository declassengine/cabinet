f%13 DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY 0? HIS 3RITAimiO MAJESTY&apos;S GQyE3N CUT).SEC RET.Copy No.vCP.-1413.CA.BIB.E T.PROPOSALS FOR N3W EXPENDITURE.-Iviomorandum by tho Chancellor of tlio Excnaquar.-riousIt is my duty to call /a ttontion to tho indications which reach the Treasury almost daily of 8 further growth of publicof expenditure which was hoped for last autumn end which is pressingly demanded (in general terms) by tho Hjuso of Commons and public opinion, but there is every reason to suppose that supplementary expenditure is likely to be incurred in the present financial year in addition to that proposed in tho original estimates presented to Parliament and ovor and above the margin included-in the /Budget calculations.   Proposals for new expenditure in future yeare not allowed for in the calcula-tion for tho &quot;Normal Year&quot; ara also being daily received by the Treasury.In view particularly of tho situation in the Wear and Middle Bast it would bo optimistic to orpoot that Army Estimates will not bo exceeded.   A Navy supplementary is apparently already inevitable owing to tho failure of the Admiralty to carry out diachargos from the dockyards in accordance with the programme intended and to wages rises.     Tho Admiralty are also proposing new expenditure at the rate of  10,000,000 a year on the maintenance of a Naval force in the Baltic.The jpiehory Departments have proposed an oxpondituro of  7,000,000 on the repetition on a large scile of the Government purchase of Herrings undertaken o oootianally last year.expsndi:tenjrr.Not only are tiiero no si^ns of that reductionThe
The Agriculture Bill involves a guarantee of minimum prices for cereals which may involve very largo expenditure before many years have passed, particularly in regard to Oats.Lord Lee has also placed before the Cabinet proposals for the settlement of disabled ox-sorvico men on the land wnich are estimated to ost  3,000,000 in addition to the  20,000,000 already allocated for Land settlement generally.As the Cabinet are alroady aware, unless the price of broad is further increased in the autumn, there is likely to be a largo increase of the Breed;/ Subsidy,The latest proposals of the Labour Ministry as to unemployment Insurance involve an increased expend!turo of nearly  2,000,000 per annum in addition to the increase of  13,000,000 per annum on pre-war expenditure involved by the Bill as introduced.Dr. Macnsrnara is also reviving proposals which were not pressed by Sir Robert Home for the training of fit ex-servico men and the continued training of women which are roughly estimated to cost  6,00^000 and  400,000 respectively.The Ministry of Health which has already had this Session a Health Insurance Bill costing  2-j millions a year has put forward proposals for capi1.pl expenditure estimated at  2,000,000 and annual subsidies lively to reach  150.000 a year fur the establishment of Village Settlements for Tuberculous men and for a   for   grant.to Voluntary Hospitals estimated to cost  500,000 this year.     There is also every possibility of proposals in the near future for new expenditure on Poor Law and Medical Services.A Supplementary of  1,000,000 is already suggested on the Public Buildings Vote in respect of Ministry of Pensions Buildings.An application has boon received from the University Grants Committee for an addition of  1,000 ,-000 a year to the grant in aid of Universities which was raised to  1,000,000 only in 1919. The proposals of the Asquith Commission in respect of Oxford and Cambridge are yet to be received.Lord Mil rer/
L&apos;--rd MiInor is asking for s loan of  1,000,000 (spread ovor 5 years) t:  tho Uganda Protectorate*      Tho acquisition of Nauru also moans a Supplementary on tho Colonial services vote for this yo--r of sbout  1,500,000. -The Foreign Office propose the continuance of the subsidy at tho rate of  300,000 a yoar to tho King of t:ie Hadjaz which . is not provided for in the Estimate.Tho passing of the Irish Education Bill will involve an increased expenditure of about  1,000,000 a yoar on. Irish Education and further large eoponditure will bo involved by tho proposed Land Bill.Apart from largo proposals of this kind. Departments still show the greatest reluctance to terminate minor kinds of expenditure which grew up during the War, o.g. on propaganda: secret service.     Tiro continuance of expenditure of this Kind, though possibly not very considerable in amount does not assist to create an atmosphere of oconomy in the public service.The foregoing are merely samples taken at random during the last few weeks to illustrate the growing tendency of Departments to revert to tho attitude towards public expenditure which prevailed immediately after the Armistice and which was temporarily eneexod during the economy&quot;campaign of last autumn*Unless steps ore again taken&apos;to chock this tendency, it is clear that expenditure during the current year will be largely in excess of the original Estimates.     further the reduction of Naval, Military and Air Expenditure to the peace standards . laid down by the Cabinet (total  135,000,000) will bo indefinite! postponed and Civil Service Estimates will sh)w a persistent, rise year by year and will always enormously exceed tho figures given Tor tho &quot;Normal Year&quot;, .    Tho result will be completely to falsify my anticipations of tho provision available for Debt reduction in the nrosont and future years.
Much of too expenditure may bo vary desirable ra merits, if it is thought light to rank it before the reduction of &amp;9tfb.&quot; It is im;: impossible Cor the Treasury to deal effectively in detail \;ith such proposals as we have mentioned, unless definite instructions are given as to the general policy to bo pursued. Hitherto the Cabinet or Home Affairs Committee has considered such proposals one by one as they arise *     I must now ask the Oabioot for a general ruling..g&apos;.&apos;-   1 hh/ -&apos;:-&apos;-&apos;:vv&apos;..&quot;^-&apos;--0 0&apos;-&apos;h^;,,:..;i.;;:--0&apos;,- - OhOO-&apos;    \h h 0 i&apos;.&apos;.-.&apos;The Budget estimates held out the prospect of a debtreduction of  234,000,000 (of which some  70vCOO..000 onlymight be available for Pleating Debt).   It is a commonoritie ism that there is no certainty that those prospectswill bo realised.   Public opinion is frankly incredulous:and the small response to Treasury Bonds (even thoughhypothecated to floating debt redemption) reflects thisincredulity.    If there is a largo difference between theBudget Estimate and the ultimate result it will prove impossible to persuade the public to Stcppoft Government issues or to believe in Government /professions of economy &quot;and to recognise the reasonablenessof taxation on the present scale,     But unless a very,definite halt is called, it is pretty clear that there willbe this discrepancy between original estimate and finalresult 0It was argued the othor day in CaOTnet that the limit of taxation had boon reached,   I believe this to be substantially true.       The public - at least our public - will not support us in imposing further burdens and will be bitterly and angrily disappointed if the reduction of debt to secure which they have submitted to those heavy taxes is not obtained.   At / the best my calculations may be gravely upset by any slackening &apos; of trade or any considerable industrial disturbancet but these &quot;are circumstances beyond our control.   Expenditure is within /our control and the time has come when the control must be rigorous and effective.(Initialled)      A/Co
