RATION, The Committee had under consideration the outlinesof a, Scheme of Reparation, representing the outcome of the jj discussions between British, French and Belgian experts.(A copy of the Scheme as submitted to the ;   - Committee is attached hereto and marked&quot;Appendix I&quot;)..Before entering upon a detailed consideration of the Scheme, the Committee discussed the question whether its terms were, in the circumstances, practicable, and, in particular, whether the amounts which it was proposed that Germany should pay were not excessive, particularly as regards the earllor years.   It was .suggestion that Germany might prefer to default under the terms of the Treaty rather than accept the Scheme, and it was not altogether out of the question that the German Government might default in any event in the first year.It was generally agreed that the success of any Scheme, depended, on the re--establishment of German credit, and that it was essential to do everything to revive confidence in Germany itself and to encourage her-to raise large external loans as quickly as possible.   As she must look to the neutrals for capital, any Scheme must be made attractive to the/pros-pective neutral bondholder.Sir John Bradbury doubted whether the Scheme was prac-ticable; personally he was dubious whether Germany could pay  150,000,000 per annum during the next two or three years, though it mi gilt be possible for her to pa^y some such figure as this after a revival of confidence in the country had been followed by the sending of remittances - from America.   On the whole, he felt that the amounts In.the Scheme were too high.Mr. Blackett said that, while he realised that the -amounts were on the high side, he did not believe that they were beyond Germany1s capacity to pay, provided that she set-tied down to work.   He felt that the best line was to press Germany to capitalise as much and as quickly as possible.
.ause 5* Clause 5 was agreed,.ause 6* It.was decided that as Clause 6 was not really partof .the arrangement with Germany, it had better be&apos; transferred to the end of the document as a matter for consideration*Reference was made to the effect of tho treaty provisions under which the value of ships handed over toGreat Britain was credited to the Reparation Commission., and part of the credit was ultimately devoted to meeting the costof the American Army of Occupation, which cost was out of all proportion to the size of that Arnly.The Committee then considered the &quot;document Clause by clause, and agreed that it would be better to reverse theorder of Clauses 1 and 2, and open with a statement to theeffect that the German Government agreed to the establishment Clauses - f1 and 2.        by the Reparation Commission of a body to be designated by someisuch title as &quot;The German External Debt Commission&quot;,fciause 3 (a). These provisions were admittedly insertedv   in terrorem; and the CoLFivotse felt doubtful whether&quot;they should be insisted upon.plause 3 (b). In agreeing to this sub-Clause; the Committeerequested Sir Robert Home to consider certain proposals which had been submitted by Sir . Laming Worthington Evans t-j the Treasury, . respecting the possibility of the imposition of an Export Tax on German commodities, which it might be possible to make use of as security,ub&apos;,-Clauses Sub-Clauses (c) and (d) were agreed, subjectc) and (d). to the omission in the latter Clause of the con*eluding sentence:-- &quot;and in that event it shall have complete liberty to increase or modify the German Customs Tariff or impose new Customs Taxes,,&quot;lause 4. It was agreed that a provision should be Insertedto the effect that the Reparation Commission should facilitate the flotation of any external loans, and that, subject to The assent of the Reparation Commission, Germany should,be at liberty to charge her Customs revenues or other assets; the Committee*c intention being that the position of the Reparation Commission might be somewhat analagous to that of a Trusteo for the foreign bondholders in cases where the Commission had given approval&apos;for the loan,
duse 7. Considerable discussion took place on Clause 7, andit was suggested that it might be better,, from every-prolnt.... ^of view, for the Allies to. forego the annuity payments fort(say) the first three years, thus giving Germany time to turn round, in consideration of Germany raising a loan, for, say,  500,000,000, charging it upon the Customs and distributing it among the Allies and any Neutrals who might take it upt    No annual payment would then be .., necessary for three years apart from interest and sinking-fund on the loan, which, at 10 per cent, would equal  50,000*000 per annum, an amount which it might be snticipa-ted the Germans could find.    With a view to assisting Franoe, Great Britain might agree not to put her script on the market for,, say,, five years,, provided that France put a minimum price below which her script was not to be sold.It was pointed.out that it was doubtful whether France would accept any proposal of this kind,, but in any case it was certain that the first loan which Germany could&apos; raise wouJ.d have to be. for a very small sum,, and that it was out of the question to consider a loan of  500,000,000 ;   at the present time. ,&apos;Ultimately the Committee decided to accept , Clause 7 substantially as drafted, and to let the Germans raise the question of a loan.on the above lines.:for discussion at , &apos;: Spa., I &apos;;&apos;uses 8, Clauses 8,..9,. 16 and 11 were&apos;agreed. -10, n -.,12. As regards Clause, 12* it was agreed that itwould be to the interest of the Allios to allow a higher percentage than 10 of any.;, German external loan to be retained by Germany for her own internal purposes * It was. suggested that the Allies might go as high as 25 per cent..
With regard to part II of the Aoenmkt, &quot;Arrangements to he made between the Allies&quot;, the Committee decided to omit Paragraphs 1 and 3.The Chanoellor of the Exchequer stated thathe would at once inform the Prime Minister of theConclusions reached by the Committee, and he hopedthat it would be possible to Issue a Revised Draftiof the document in a day or two.NOTE,     A Revised Draft has accordingly heen prepared, and is attached hereto as Appendix II, This Draft contains the alterations made in . the light of the discussions at the Committee, and also certain tables showing the financial effect of the proposals contained in the Scheme.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I., June 19, 1920.

Germany should agree that neither the German Government nor any German ^tate government, nor any provincial or ; municipal authority in Germany, nor any controlled society &amp;c. should participate directly or indirectly in any credit operation in an external market without the. approval of the Reparation Commission.2.    In this connection a Commission of &apos;,control of - German External Debt should be sot up by the Reparation Commission.     It shall include in additionto delegates of the lowers already represented on the Reparation Commission, a neutral delegate and a German delegate.   Its place of business shall be in Germany. 3.     By way of guarantee for the complete execution of this contract and far the undertaking entered into in accordance with heading 1 above, Germany will agree(a) to place in the hands of the ReparationCommission within 3 months certain securities representing German rentes or similar securities. The amount of such deposit shall be fixed bj the Reparation Commission which shall; -also determine in accordance vvith proposals to be made by . the Gorman Government the libt of the securities to be deposited as guarantees.   In the jevent of -Germary failing to carry out in full her reparation -contract
contract or in case she violates tho iindeirtakijag. entered into in virtue of heading 1 above, tho Reparation Commission; shall bo at liborty to sell at the risk of Germany the.whole or a part of the sccuritios deposited,-(b). to admit that the gross produce of the. Gorman Customs by land and sea shall be taken as security for the execution of the Reparation Contract and that no phango shall bo introduced into the Gorman Customs Tariff without the leave of *tho Reparation Commission.(c) to agree to tho appointment by tho Reparation Commission of a Receiver General of Gorman Customs through whoso hands all Customs receipts in Germany shall bo encashed for the account of tho German Government.(d) that in the event of Germany*c failing to carry out in full the obligations contained in the Reparation Contract or in case of Germany1s entering into credit operations on extcrnail market^:without having received the approval of the Reparation Commission as&quot; required under heading 1, the whole or part of tho Customs revenues shall be intercepted in the hands of, the Receiver General of Gorman Customs by the Reparation -Commission and shall bo applied by tho Reparation Commission to the fulfilment of the- obligations in respect of which Gormany has defaulted.    In 3uch event the Reparation Commission may, if it regards it as necessary, through tho intermediary of the Commission of Control of Gorman External Dobt, itself assume,/tho
tfc^swforilan^ mfatx&amp;le^l&amp;^f -GermanCustoms,. and., in that event it shall har^^i^-et^ liberty to increase or modify the German Customs Tariff or impose new Customs taxes.4..     Germany agrees to use its best endeavours, under the Control of the Reparation Commission to issue a series of External Loans for the purpose of paying off in full the principal of the Reparation obligations as soon as possible.     Germany may give special pledges to sub-scribers to foreign! loans of such kind as may be judged fit including, if necessary, the pledge of her Customs Revenues.5.       In consideration of Germany&apos;s agreeing to tfee Conditions contained in headings 1, 3 and 4 above, the Governments of the Allied and Associated Powers agree not to enforce those Clauses in Parts 8, 9 &amp;nd 10 of the Treaty of Versailles ^hich give extensive powers of inters ference in Germany&apos;s financial and economic life, except in the event of Germany&apos;s defaulting in respect of the Reparations Contract and the engagements entered into in virtue of headings 1, 3 and 4 above, 6.      It is for consideration whether the Governments which have received deliveries in kind or cessions of property should not hold the cash value thereof at the disposition of the Reparation Commission as a contingent reserve to be applied by the Commission in oa:se of German default in the payment of interest for a period of years on the first loans issued for the purpose of capitalising her Reparation liability.7.

Germany may make proposals at any time through the Reparation Commission for paying off by means of a capital sum the whole or any part of the additional annuity mentioned above, and  he Reparation Commission may by unanimous vote, but not otherwise, accept such payment,10.   As security for the Reparation contract Germany shall deposit bonds in accordance with the Treaty with such modifications as may be agreed. 11.   Any balance of the cost of the Armies of Occupation up to May 1st 1&amp;21 which may not have been paid off out of the proceeds of the.value of deliveries/in

Up to 10 per cent of any German External.,.Loan may be retained by Germany for her own internal purposes and the Reparation Commission ^ay take into &apos;1 consideration further the.admission of some arrange-ment with Germany&apos;s existing neutral creditors in ccraacOifcion with the Issue of External Loan.II.   Arrangements to be made as between &quot;the Allies..1,    The United Kingdom to agree not to demanda share of the proceeds of any External Loan issuedby Germany for a period of 5 years except so far asmay be necessary to pay (a) Armies of Occupation.&apos;(b) her share of the annuity.&apos;   -,(Note       This clause is not intended to bind any portion of the British Empire other than the United Kingdom.)2.     In pursuance of conversations at LympneMonsieur Celier has made it quite clear that he regards an arrangement for treating Prance1s debt to Great Britain on lines analogous-to the treatmentgranted to Germany1 s Reparation Debt as- an integral part of any arrangements to be entered into for fixing Reparation-. - I understand his suggestion to be thet fcr 5 years Great Britain should not.take any payment whatsoever in respect of France*sdebt and that thereafter the total of Prance1a debtshould be&quot;paid off in more or less equal annualinstalments without interest over a period of, say,/30
30 years.   Great importance is attached to no claim &quot;bein.? made during thr f 1 &quot;&quot;it 5 years.It 1*4 of course oeeri- j^apctosible,! oi deajr&quot;Xn any way with.the question of France&apos;s debt to the United States or britain&apos;s debt to the United States, but it will obviously be essential that any arrangement which we may make with France as to our treatment of her debt to Great Britain shall be conditional on France*s debt to Great Britain being treated In the same way as France1s debt be the United States, in the event of Francefs conceding to the United S&amp;ates m*re favourable terms than are offered her by Great Britain.3. In covinection with the proposal thatGreat Britain should not demand capitalisation for a period of 5 years of. her sJaira on German Reparation, Various proposals have been &quot;\entatively discussed which would have the effect of avoiding the United Kingdom profiting at the, expense o/ France by her ability to wait for her money.   One 3u, gestion which seems worthy of further consideration is J,hat while Great Britain might take her due proportion out of the proceeds of any loan for the purpose of capitalising her claims on Germany, she should agree during the first 5 years to re-lend to France at &quot;The same rate of interest any sums so paid off in Advance by Germany,,

II,   Arrangements to be made as betweentlie A,*J. iea.$In pursuance of conversations at hympne Monsieur Ceiier has made it quite clear that he regards an arrangement for treating France&apos;s debt to Great Britain on lines analogous to the treatment granted to Germany1s Reparation Debt as an integral part of any arrangements to be entered into for fixing Reparation.   I understand his suggestion to be that for 5 years Great Britain should not take any payment whatsoever in respect of France&apos;s debt and that thereafter the total of France&apos;s debt should be paid off/in more or less equal annual instalments without interest over a period of, say, 30 years .   Great importance is attached to no claim being made during the first 5 years.It has of course been impossible to deal in any way with the question of Francers debt to the United States or britain s debt to the United States, but it will obviously be essential that any arrangement which we may make with France as to our treatment of her debt to Great Britain shall be conditional on Francels debt to Great Britain being treated in the same way as France!s debt to the United States, in the&apos; event of France!s conceding to the United States more favourable terms than are offered her by Great Britain.
