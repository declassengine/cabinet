HERRING    L11 SHEET    1920.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland and the President of the 5oarTWUxireV^--&apos; &apos;1.     In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet we have considered the possibility of applying the Export Trading Credits Scheme to the export of pickled herrings.   In so doing, we have consulted representatives of the Industry.2,     It is understood that the Government would be prepared to include Germany and Russia within the scope of the Scheme for this purpose.     On that assumption it appears that if the fishing were started and maintained the&apos; holders of any pickled herrings cured during the season might be exoected to utilise the Soheme only to a limited exf&amp;RV/if the amount . of the Government advance were increased from 80 per cent to (say) 90 per cent.3.     The amount of the trade which might be done under the Scheme cannot be gauged very accurately.     I-t is clear, how-ever^. that it would not represent a large fraction of the production of the fishing fleets,4,     The possibility of the Scheme coming.into operation for this purpose is dependent on the fishing being started and maintained.     ?!e are informed, however,, by responsible authorities in the Industry that while the readiness of the Government to apply.the scheme, possibly with favourable modifications, is fully appreciated, the prospect of assistance from this source cannot alone be a material factor in starting and maintaining the fishi/ig.,     This results not from any unwillingness on the part of the curers and exporters to co-operate to the best of their ability, but from the   fact that any improvement in the general situation which the Export Credits scheme could produce would not be such as to enable s the fishermen to put to sea and make a living in view.of the absence of immediate opportunities to dispose of the goods for cash.5.     &quot;/e have also examined the possibility of piokled herrings being purchased from the funds provided by the Government for Relief Credits and supplied to the countries to be assisted from such Credits,     It appears that no great reliance can at present be placed upon this means of disposal. &apos;lr. Oorvin, General secretary to the International Committee for Relief Credits, informed the Scottish Office on 28th Kay that the Committee had already had various offers of supplies of pickled herrings from neutral countries, and that at present the markets in Central Surope where these supplies might, be disposed of are not large.     He offered to communicate further if it were found that markets will be available for British herrings.    The matter was discussed on 10th June with ^ir William Goode in London.     It is understood that each borrowing country (or recipient of assistance) is free to take or refuse any class of food offered by any of the countries providing credits.   Sir William confirmed the view that the borrowing countries are not at present disposed tc take pickled herrings. He said that all that could d*.be - -ies
be done was. to put forward offers with prices, and he and Mr. Gorvin would do whatever they could to assist the object in view,     It is possible that the superiority of the Lritish -pickled herrings will lead to demands for them in preference to-the supplies offered by II or way, etc,   At the moment, however, the , prospects are indefinite.f oicned) Robert Kunro, (   tf     ):&apos;R*zi* Borne,Whitehall Gardens * 5.* .7.1, 11th June, 19SO.
