This document is the property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.391SECRET.%J &apos;.....THE CABINET.( C P&apos; 1 497    hjj SITUATION IN TURKEY.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith a telegram from General Milne on the present military_21^situation in Turkey.W. S. C.The War Office,18*A June, 1920.From General Milne to Secretary of State.Despatched 17th June, 1920, 1300. Received 18th, 0930.No. G.C. 823, cipher, 17th June.   In 4 parts.Part 1.   .Personal and secret.   Reference your telegram No. 8523d, 17th June, and in continuation of my No. G.C. 820, 17th June, to War Office.The complete failure of the Turkish Government troops, whom I have now disarmed, has now thrown on Allies following responsibilities : A. The defence of the Chatalja lines (including Constantinople water supply). B. The maintenance of order in Constantinople and Scutari. C. The defence of the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus. D. The defence of the Gallipoli peninsula. E.-r-The defence of the Asiatic side of the Dardanelles.Part 2.The (?) French consider that their reserve division (?) though largely (?) composed of young untrained troops could garrison the Chatalja lines and at the same time supply 1 battalion to hold the Bulair lines which, with the French battalion already in Gallipoli, they consider would assure the Peninsular since they do not consider the Tracian Nationalist forces of very great account.After deducting the number withheld to maintain order in Pera, Stamboul and Scutari, I have only 10 battalions to guard the Asiatic sides of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus.This is after withdrawal (?) of the troops from (?) Ismid, but does not include the two battalions now at Batum. The attitude of the Nationalists is (?) becoming increasingly menacing. ,Part 8.I consider the - following additional troops are required here to deal with the situation:  . ,] Aeroplane Squadron (bombing and reconnaissance). 2 Cavalry Regiments.1 Infantry Division with 2 Brigades of Artillery (chiefly howitzers). 1 6-inch Howitzer Battery. 1 60-pr. B.L. Gun Battery.1 Mountain Artillery Battery (if possible Howitzer). 1 Battery 8 light Tanks. 1. Battery 4 L.A.M.B. Cars. 1 2 Batteries (each 8) Stokes Trench Mortars.Proportionate increase in staff, transport (chiefly Ford vans and A.T. carts) and Administrative Services.   An efficient Signal Service is especially important.
Part 4.These reinforcements would enable me to swiftly resist an attack in force on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, and to have some reserves to meet developments elsewhere, such as on the Asiatic side of the Dardanelles which is too long to hold continuously.I would again impress on you that from the report I received as to the; relations between the Italians and the Nationalists I would regard Italian troops&apos;,.&apos;as more of a danger than a reinforcement.Latest reports indicate that the French appear to expect Nationalist attack on the Heraclea, mines (Zungulk) which form the coal supply of Constantinople.
