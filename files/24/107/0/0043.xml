Nil.Part II. Departmental.The Ministry and Oversea Settlement.The work of the Ministry in connection with oversea settlement within the British Empire, as well as in foreign countries, is now in process of development on the lines laid down by the Inter-Departmental Committee formed late in 1919. This body consists of representatives of the Oversea Settlement Committee, formed earlier in the year on the resignation of the voluntary committee responsible for the work of the Emigrants&apos; Informa-tion Office, of the Department of Overseas Trade, of the India Office, and of the Appoint-ments and the Employment Departments of the Ministry of Labour. The application of the general principles established by the Inter-Departmental Committee for the co-ordination of the. work of overseas employment, and the general line of action to be taken in the acceptance and filling of vacancies overseas, lie in the hands of the Oversea Employ-ment Branch.The main task which the Ministry have to fulfil is naturally to see so far as possible that those who intend to settle abroad should be of suitable type, and that on leaving this country they go, whenever possible, to employment already secured.  The Ministry(c 2008)  150  6/20  h &amp; s 2 I
are therefore aiming, so far as the self-governing Dominions are concerned, at establishing close co-operation through the Dominion Departments for Labour or Immigration with the officially recognised employment agencies. It is intended that employers overseas offering work shall submit full particulars to the local employment office, and that the bona fides and suitability of the offer shall be subject to the scrutiny both of the local officials and of the appropriate central authority of the Dominion Government before the vacancies so offered are laid by the Ministry in this country before intending settlers. In this way information will be available as to the prevalent conditions of employment, the attitude of labour organisations, and other essential features of the position lbefore any attempt is made to fill the vacancies. The position as regards other parts of the Empire, which are not s ?lf-governing, and as regards foreign countries, is perhaps likely to cause more difficulty. The parts of the Empire which are not self-governing have so far not developed employment services. The great bulk of vacancies, however, at present notified from the Crown Colonies and Protectorates come from the Crown Agents for the Colonies ; and it is hoped to arrange that, so far as possible, all vacancies should be notified to the Ministry through the oversea Government concerned. In the case of foreign countries, the information at the disposal of the Department of Overseas Trade will be used to measure the desirability of accepting or rejecting any vacancies offered.The full establishment of such a system of co-operation will naturally be a matter of time ; but the negotiations necessary, so far as they have proceeded, show very hopeful prospects. *The question of the oversea settlement of women is receiving special consideration. It is intended that vacancies for women workers shall, so far as possible, be endorsed only in consultation with an accredited women&apos;s organisation, and that women intending to settle overseas shall have at their disposal the advice of special local interviewing com-mittees.It will be remembered, in this connection, that a joint Committee of the Oversea Settlement Committee and the Committee of the National Relief Fund are administering a special grant of  250,000 from the National Relief Fund to assist persons suffering from hardships arising out of the war and wishing to settle overseas. The work is being carried on with the assistance, among other bodies, of the Employment Department, and in particular, of the Local Employment Committees attached to the Exchanges.Part III.-The Labour and Socialist Press. Topics of Discussion.The matter which receives most general notice in the papers reviewed this week is the reports of Lord Hunter&apos;s Committee of Enquiry into the Indian disturbances which took place in the &quot;spring of last year. As might be expected, the majority report is criticised, and the minority report approved. Mr. Philip Snowden makes a favourable reference to the despatch of the Secretary of State for India on the subject, but generally this despatch is overlooked. The prominence given to this report is another illustration of what may be termed the international bias of these papers. The principal other topic dealt with is the question of the relations of the Trade Union movement and the Government towards Russia.The Labour Movement and Ireland and Poland.It cannot be said that the vital issues now pending as to the action the Trade Union movement should take on the question of Polish and Irish war material,receive the con-sideration in these papers which their importance deserves. One of the difficulties of the whole policy of industrial action for political purposes is the difficulty of setting a bound to its legitimate use. This difficulty is admirably, though unconsciously, illustrated by an article in the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; and by Mr. Ramsay Macdonald in &quot; Forward.&quot; The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; points out that unless the dockers and railwaymen refuse to handle munitions of all kinds, some of the munitions ostensibly shipped to other countries may find their way to Poland or countries hostile to Russia. Particular complaint is made that the London dockers have loaded aeroplanes for Egypt within the last fortnight. The demand of this paper is that the dockers and railwaymen should see that no munitions or troops should be moved about from place to place within this country. Only by such root and branch methods does the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; think that this anti-munitions
(C 2008)* See also p. 260, below.212policy can be made water-tight. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald makes an attack upon the Secretary of State for War, and his suggestion is that &quot; if our industrial colleagues who&apos; are doing such good work by refusing to transport war material to Poland would only add to their demands the resignation of Mr. Churchill, they would show a true appreciation of the things they are up against.&quot; The &quot; Nation &quot; makes a series of academic points which endeavour to show that this action of the dockers and the N.U.R. is a typical illus-tration of the present-day decadence of Parliamentary institutions. The &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; shows a better appreciation of -the facts of the case in its appeal to the dockers and railwaymen not to wait for their executives or the Triple Alliance but to take action on their own account. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; refers to the press rumours with regard to statements alleged to have been made by members of the Labour delegation now in Russia. &quot; It is impossible to believe in the accuracy of the statement to the effect that a member of the delegation assured the Russian proletariat that there was a likelihood of the British proletariat following the example of Russia.&quot; He notices the reports that the Russian press disapprove the reticence of the delegates and agrees that a reticent attitude is the only sensible one for them to adopt.The Government and Russia.The Merthyr&quot;&quot; Pioneer &quot; expresses the opinion that the presence of the Russian trade delegation in this country is a proof that inevitable circumstances are compelling capitalism &quot; to a course which ultimately means its death.&quot; In &quot; The Call,&quot; Mr. W. H. Ryde cKal-lenges the Government to give M. Krassin an opportunity of meeting and refuting the current charges being made against Soviet Russia. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; deals in a special article with the whole Government policy towards Russia. The article is based upon the opinion of this paper that there are only two courses open : we must consider whether we wish, or do not wish, to destroy the Bolshevik Government; between the policies of war and peace there is no third course. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; then presents its view of the facts in support of a policy of peace : which view contains nothing novel.Government Policy.The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; makes reference to the second clause of the Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill. This paper sees no danger that the clause will mean the working of two shifts in the Lancashire textile industry. It is, how-ever, suggested that real misgivings do exist regarding other industries, that an attempt may be made to make permanent temporary war-time relaxations of the provisions of the Factory Acts. The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; is confident &quot; that the prominent Trade Union officials and workers present at Washington will not be parties to this legislation.&quot; A paragraph on the matter, circulated by the Labour News Service, appears in many of the Labour papers.*The Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; discusses what should be the attitude of the Labour move-ment to the housing bonds campaign, with special reference to a meeting of the Local Trades Council to decide this matter. The ordinary objections to the scheme are rehearsed. These are, firstly, that the scheme is doomed to failure ; secondly, that the burden of pro-viding funds for housing schemes should be undertaken by the National Exchequer ; and, thirdly, that the Labour movement ought not to have any connection with any campaign which has for its purpose the investment of working-class savings in a security not imme-diately realisable at par. The Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; further expresses the opinion that Labour opinion should instinctively revolt from official alliance with any campaign asso-ciated with interest bearing investments. Nevertheless, in another article in this paper, the worker is recommended to invest his spare cash in the interest bearing investments now being issued by the Co-operative Wholesale Society.The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; in a leading article, endorses the prospectus of the London Building Guild which was dealt with in this report last week, p. 251. &quot; No more inspiring document has emanated from the Trade Union movement in this generation.&quot; The docu-ment is regarded as a crushing blow to those people who criticise Trade Unionism as a movement concerned only with the material conditions of labour. It is somewhat remarkable that no reference is made in this article to the Manchester Building Guild.The Socialist Movement.The decision of the co-operative congress to postpone for another year consideration of the proposals for an electoral and political alliance between the Co-operative Movement,
the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress is nowhere regretted in these papers. Mr. Philip Snowden severely criticises the capital levy resolution passed by the congress as being ambiguous and too radical. In &quot; The Call,&quot; Mr. A. H. Hawkins attacks the Labour Party for making efforts to win the support of the middle classes. His argument is that the proletariat properly so-called is already a majority of the people in this country and provides a sufficient field for propaganda.The progress of the movement for the formation of a United Communist Party is noticed in &quot; The Call &quot; and the &quot; Socialist.&quot; Mr. A. A. Watts, in &quot; The Call,&quot; states that the result of the negotiations is that they may go forward with the formation of this new Party. Mr. Watts believes that all that is necessary for the success of this Party is the sincere reception by its members of the principles of the Third International and their loyal acquiescence with majority decisions as to methods and tactics. In the &quot; Socialist &quot; Mr. James Clunie maintains that the elements do not exist for communist unity and that communist unity can only be set up now as a result of compromise, and he advocates the claim of the Socialist Labour Party that its continued existence, undiluted by any corn-promise, is essential to safeguard the revolutionary development of the working-class movement.Part IV.-General Topics.General Survey of the Week.With regard to the industrial situation, the most important event of the week under review has been the issue of the Award of the National Wages Board giving increased rates of pay to railway employees. The details of the Award are somewhat complicated, and it is as yet too early to judge their reception by the men concerned. The hearing of this case and the issuing of this Award have been the first work done by the Board. Important developments may be anticipated as a result of the meeting of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain on Thursday, 10th June, to consider the policy to be adopted in reply to the increase in the coal prices which were made last month.With regard to the more general situation, particularly the attitude of the trade union movement towards Ireland, Poland and Hungary, the situation has been simplified during the week by the reference of these matters without exception to the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress with requests for the summoning of a special congress to deal with the matters, and by the suspension of all further action.Two Bills now before Parliament are attracting attention in the trade union and labour world, namely, the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Bill, and the Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill. The provisions of the first Bill are being received with much hostility in Scotland, but the proposal to oppose the Bill in dramatic fashion by rent strikes and general strikes should not, perhaps, be taken too seriously. The latter Bill has in general met with approval but Clause 2, which allows double shifts for women and children between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. has provoked strenuous opposition in several quarters, particularly in the textile industries. The manifesto of the Standing Committee of Industrial Women&apos;s Organisations has appeared somewhat late in the day in view of the fact that the Bill was introduced into the House of Commons on the 4th May.The Unemployment Position.The number of H.M. Forces policies current for the week ended the 28th May, 1920, was 196,508 (195,152 lodged by men and 1,356 by women). The previous week (the .21st May) there were 203,800 policies current, of which 202,300 were lodged by men and 1,500 by women.66,897 unemployment books (44,938 lodged by males and 21,959 by females) remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts at the 28th May, a decrease of 1,801 since the 21st May. At the latter date 46,078 books were lodged by males and 22,620 by females (a total of 68,698).At the 21st May, 54 policies remained lodged by short time workers, a decrease of four on the number recorded the previous week. Of these, 30 were in the insured industries (70 per cent, being in the Engineering and Ironfounding Group) and 24 in the uninsured.The total live register at all Employment Exchanges at the week ended the 28th May was 264,199 men, 43,749 women and 20,196 juveniles compared with 270,336 men, 46,560 women and 21,529 juveniles a week ago (the 21st May) and 276,939 men, 48,976 women and 25,406 juveniles a month ago.
Ireland, Poland and Hungary.During the week under review a decided modification has taken place in the attitude of the National Union of Railwaymen towards the question of the transport of munitions to Ireland and Poland. The instruction of the executive that members of the union should not handle munitions which might be used by the Polish Government against Russia, has been withdrawn, and, following upon an interview with the Prime Minister on Thursday, the 3rd June, the Irish members of the union now on strike in Dublin, were instructed to return to work, &quot; in order to give the Labour movement an opportunity of acting on their behalf.&quot; Negotiations were opened in Dublin on the 7th June between the strike committee and the local officials of the London and North-Western Railway Company with a view to a settlement of the dispute, but no agreement has yet been reached.The visit of Messrs. Farren and Johnston to the annual conference of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation is dealt with below; and cannot be said to have been successful. The Executive of the Irish Trades Union Congress and Labour Party met in Dublin on Tuesday, the 8th inst., to review the situation, and a manifesto expressing: their opinion on the current situation and the proposal for joint action with the British T.U.C.is expected. Thedecision of the Dublin railwaymen to negotiate with the L. &amp;N.W.R. may perhaps be regarded as a defeat for this body in its attempt to take control of the movement in Ireland against the transport of troops or munitions.The executive of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation has replied vigorously to an appeal from the &quot; Hands Off Russia &quot; Committee to the members of its constituent bodies to take &quot; strike action against the attack on Russia by Poland.&quot; The executive protests against the attempt of the Committee to influence industrial action on a political object, and expresses the opinion that such appeals over the heads of executives to the rank and file, endorsed by individuals who hold official positions in the trade union world, are destructive of trade union discipline. The proper bodies to deal with such matters are the executives of the unions.A further complication has been introduced by the decision of the International Federation of Trade Unions to boycott Hungary as from the 20th June, and the publication of the report of the Labour deputation to Hungary, which returned last week from its tour of investigation. The decision of the International Federation will be considered by the Trades Union Congress Parliamentary Committee on the 16th June, which will have before it also the report of the joint delegation. Should the Parliamentary Committee determine to call a special Congress to consider these problems, the Congress will meet with advantage of all the issues involved being before it in a definite, practical and urgent form.It is reported that the Scottish Trades Union Congress intends to hold a special meeting on the 10th July to consider the questions of Ireland and Poland, as well as high prices and the Increase of Rents and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Bill.Two general conclusions may be drawn from these facts. The first is that the respon-sible leaders of the trade union movement realise the close connection of these questions. The withdrawal by the N.U.R. of its instruction with regard to Polish munitions must be attributed to the fact that this instruction was creating a precedent by which their freedom of action with regard to war material for Ireland would be considerably hampered. This is borne out by the fact that Mr. H. N. Brailsford has written an article to the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; advocating a boycott of Polish munitions because of the effect it would have on British Government policy towards Ireland. The reversal of the N.U.R. instruction and the N.T.W.F. circular mean that all action taken with regard to Polish munitions, pending the decision of the Trades Union Congress, will be entirely unofficial and against the wishes of the trade union leaders. The second fact is that the trade union movement thinks that these questions are of such a character that decisions upon them can only be properly come to by the Trades Union Congress, as representative of the British trade union movement as a whole.This latter conclusion contains two further implications. The method by which the International Federation of Trade Unions has proposed to put its boycott of Hungary into operation has been rejected in this country. The proposal of the International Federation has been that the boycott should be organised by the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation, and that the latter body should instruct its members to carry out the mandate. The National Transport Workers&apos; Federation at Southampton, however, virtually refused to accept these instructions and expressed a preference for the obverse method of action, namely, that the mandate of the International Federation of Trade Unions to the national Transport bodies should be conveyed through national trade union bodies and not through sectional international organisations. The second implication is that the transport workers find themselves in an awkward position through the frequent demands which are made, in view of their strategic position, that they should(C 2008) 21 3
take independent sympathetic action on behalf of all varieties of causes. It does not appear that they will take official action in these matters unless they are first assured that they will be fully supported by the whole of the British trade union movement. Mr. Thomas at Battersea on the 6th June declared that if it were wrong for railwaymen to carry munitions of war it was wrong for others to make them, and the same point was made in the protest of the Executive of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation against the action of the &quot; Hands Off Russia &quot; Committee,Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill.The Standing Committee of Industrial Women&apos;s Organisations, over which Miss Mary Macarthur presides, has issued a manifesto protesting against the provisions of Clause 2 &apos;0f this Bill on the ground that it has no part in the conventions agreed to by the Inter-national Labour Conference at Washington, and that the ratification of these conventions is being used as a cover for the introduction of objectionable measures, and secondly that it would legitimise the two-shift system for women workers and therefore mark a retro-progression from the Factory Acts. The terms of this clause were first attacked by the &quot; New Statesman &quot; on the 15th May, and the question has since been taken up by the &quot; Manchester Guardian &quot; and the &quot; Yorkshire Observer,&quot; which papers may be taken in this connection as representative of the cotton and wool textile industries.Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Bill.The Scottish Labour Housing Association is making active preparations for a campaign against the provisions in this Bill which allow rents to be increased. A conference of Labour, Socialist, Co-operative and ex-Service organisations took place at Edinburgh on the 5th June under the auspices of this association, and other meetings are reported in Dundee and Glasgow. The Glasgow Labour Housing Committee, a constituent body of the Scottish Labour Housing Association, is reported to be forming committees in the leading Clydeside industrial establishments to organise strike action. The ambition of the association is to secure a rent strike against the provisions of the Bill should they be passed into law, this rent strike to be supported by a 24-hour general strike and periodical Trade Union demonstrations. The Labour Housing Association has called a national conference to be held at the Essex Hall on Saturday, the 19th June, to discuss the Bill.The Parliamentary Labour Party.Complaints have been common during the whole of the duration of the present Parlia-ment of the inefficiency of the Labour Party members of the House of Commons. Attacks upon Labour members from Socialist extremists could always, of course, be expected, but the more damaging criticism was that of the more moderate men, principally those I.L.P. leaders who were unseated at the last general election, that the Parliamentary Labour Party often failed through lack of expert knowledge of procedure and Parlia-mentary technique. A committee&apos;consisting of Messrs. J. H. Thomas, W. Brace, Tyson Wilson, Neil McLean, T. Griffiths and B. Spoor, was recently appointed to consider how this state of affairs could be remedied. The committee decided to recommend the appoint-ment of Mr. Ramsay Macdonald as a kind of technical expert and &quot; coach &quot; to the party. Mr. Macdonald is believed to have agreed to the proposal provided that the invitation extended to him were practically unanimous and that he were given a definite official position. A party meeting on the 2nd inst., however, negatived the proposal, the bulk of the trade union members being in the majority. This action illustrates the division which does exist between the trade unionists in the party and the others, and shows how loath the former are to adopt any arrangement which may savour of I.L.P. leadership. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald believes that the Parliamentary Labour Party has not shown sufficient interest in foreign affairs, but his criticisms of the party, on this count, have been less bitter than Mr. Philip Snowden&apos;s.The Cost of Living.It is announced that the special committee of inquiry representative of the Parlia-mentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party and the Co-opera-tive movement, which is to investigate the causes of high prices and to formulate remedies, will hold its first meeting on Thursday, the 17th June. The Labour Party representatives will be Mr. C. T. Cramp and Mr. Ramsay Macdonald.
A conference of representatives of Lancashire and Cheshire trade unions, socialist parties, and co-operative organisations was held in Manchester on the 5th June to discuss this matter. It is reported that the remedies suggested were : a capital levy ; the estab-lishment of state and municipal banks, the removal of restrictions on international trade ; the readjustment of the local rating system, and an energetic campaign by the Co-operative movement.The National Wages Board.The award of the National Wages Board with regard to the railwaymen&apos;s wages was published on the 5th June. The National Union of Railwaymen had applied for  1 a week advance for all their members covered by the January national settlement, and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen for a standard rate of  1 a day for enginemen, 15s. for firemen, 10s. for cleaners, and new improvements in working con-ditions with regard to holidays, payment of overtime, Sunday and night duty. The Board awarded increases ranging, for locomotive grades, from 2s. per week for cleaners to 7s. for drivers ; for signalmen ranging from 2s. to 8s. Qd. per week, pending the con-clusion of the classification of signal boxes which is now in progress ; and for other grades ranging from 4s. to 7s. 6d. per week in London and industrial areas, and from 2s. to 3s. Qd. for rural districts. These advances are in addition to any increases due under the sliding scale and come into operation as from the 14th June. Questions of demarcation between industrial and rural areas are to be referred to a committee consisting of two members chosen by the railway companies, two members chosen by the unions, and an independent chairman. The demand of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen with, regard to holidays, overtime and Sunday work are not granted. In their conclusions, the Board record their view that the absence of any effective system of co-ordinating changes in rates of wages is largely responsible for the fact that wages settlements tend to be disturbed not because of inherent defects but because of changes in the comparative level of wages in different trades brought about without due regard to the position outside the industry immediately affected. The Board suggest that every effort should be made to ensure that movements of wages in the different industries should come effectively under review by a co-ordinating authority. The report was signed by all members of the Board except Mr. D. A. Matheson, one of the railway companies&apos; members, who dissented from the clauses granting the increased rates of pay.Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.A special national conference of this body will open in London on Thursday, the 10th June, to formulate the miners&apos; policy in reply to the action of the Government in increasing the prices of coal last month. In preparation for this conference meetings have been held of the members of the Federation for the purpose of instructing delegates. The Lancashire and Cheshire Miners&apos; Federation has instructed its delegates to move for a new wages advance of 40 per cent. The delegates of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation will move for an advance &quot; commensurate with the ascertained surplus profits of the mining industry,&quot; the advance to take the form of a flat rate increase for all workmen. The Scottish miners have decided to adhere to the resolution of their annual conference for an increase in wages equivalent to the recent increases in prices.Mr. Brace&apos;s remarks at the South Wales conference may be quoted. The miners had failed to get the public or the workmen of other industries to believe in their honest desire for nationalisation to secure the coal of the country for the use of the people at a reason-able price. There was nothing left for the miners but to insist upon receiving their fair share of profits and to press for the removal of control of prices. When this was done the general public would see that nationalisation was inevitable. Mr. Hartshorn at this conference declared that the profits of the South Wales coalfield were now  50,000,000 per annum as compared with  4,000,000 before the war.The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; is endeavouring to create bad feeling out of the fact that the arrangements for the decentralisation of the control over the distribution of coal have been communicated to, and discussed by, coal factors in private conference.National Transport Workers&apos; Federation.The annual general council meeting of this association was held at Southampton on 3rd and 4th June. In his presidential address Mr. Gosling reviewed the current Labour situation.  He agreed that the present high cost of living resulted from a general world
shortage of goods which could only be overcome by increased production, but insisted that before the worker could with safety increase production, he must be assured against his old insecurity of tenure of employment. The establishment of world peace was, however,, an equally important condition for a reduced cost of living, and the Government should do its part in securing this. If the Hours of Employment Bill should, in its final form, exclude the seafaring section of their members, he foresaw that they would have to decide an important question, whether they would take industrial action to amend a Parliamentary Bill, or whether they would declare that this was not a political question and would proceed to deal with it on industrial lines. Mr. Gosling showed special satisfaction with the result of Lord Shaw&apos;s Court of Inquiry, and congratulated his audience on the fact that this result had been achieved without the loss of a single meal to a single child.With regard to the internal organisation of the union, the principal topic of discussion was the question how to promote the further amalgamation of the constituent bodies of the federation. It appeared to be generally agreed that the activities of the federation were impeded by the number of unions catering for similar classes of its members. Apart from the smaller unions, there are two great dockers&apos; unions, two seamen&apos;s unions and many vehicle workers&apos; unions. Mr. Gosling declared that he was in favour of the federation taking ,over all the organisers of the constituent bodies so that they could concentrate upon organising occupations rather than sectional unions. Mr. Bevin declared that the time was not yet ripe for the formation of a One Big Union &quot; of transport workers, and the conference adopted a recommendation to the affiliated unions to proceed with amalgamation by groups. Mr. Cathery expressed a hope that before the next congress they would be able to announce that the whole of the seafaring unions had joined up in one group.The conference passed a resolution calling upon the Government to schedule as industrial accidents cases of smallpox and other diseases to which dock workers are exposed in the course of their employment.A considerable part of the second session was devoted to the questions of Hungary and Ireland. A communication was read from the Secretary of the International Federation of Transport Workers. The communication stated that this body, after consultation with the International Federation of Trade Unions, had decided to boycott Hungary from the 20th June. The conference signified its agreement with the policy suggested, but adopted the views of Messrs. Tillett, Sexton and Gosling that the matter was really one for the British Trades Union Congress, and the matter accordingly was referred to the Triple Alliance and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress. Messrs. Farren and Johnston made a statement to the conference on behalf of the Irish Trades Union Congress and Labour Party with regard to the shipment of munitions to Ireland. Their intervention does not appear to have been particularly welcome to the leaders, and the conference decided to endorse the decision of the Triple Alliance that the matter was one for the Trades Union Congress.An interesting feature of the proceedings was Mr. Bevin&apos;s report on the action of the International Federation in calling a boycott of Dutch ships in support of the Dutch seamens and dockers&apos; strike in the spring of this year. He stated that the whole question had been reviewed by the federation, and there was a consensus of opinion that had the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation been able to consider the position prior to the strike, a long struggle might have been avoided. It had been decided that before international support could be given in the future, the facts should be submitted with applications for assistance to the International Secretariat, and that the General Council of the International should approve all disputes before international action could be taken.The N.T.W.F. has recently met with marked success in its conduct of two important wage negotiations on behalf of groups of its constituent unions, namely, the claim of the dockers for a minimum wage which resulted in Lord Shaw&apos;s Court of Inquiry, and the negotiations for an advance in wages for omnibus men employed in London. These successes will considerably assist in the process of consolidation which is contemplated by the leaders of the Federation.Building Guilds.The agreement which has been reached between the Ministry of Health and the representatives of the Manchester Building Guild with regard to the form of contract between Building Guilds and Local Housing Authorities which the Ministry will approve, should allow the Manchester Building Guild to commence operations at an qarly date.With regard to the progress of the London Building Guild, the formation of which was dealt with in this report last week, it is reported that the Architects&apos;, Surveyors&apos; and Assistants&apos; Professional Union is in negotiation with the Building Trades Federation and the London Building Guild with a view to becoming definitely part of the movement.
All inquiries relating to this report should be addressed to :-Intelligence Division,Ministry op Labour,Montagu House,Whitehall,London, S.W. 1.International Federation of Trade Unions.The decision of the bureau of this body to put into operation a boycott of Hungary was noticed in this Report last week. After a conference with the General Council of the International Federation of Transport Workers on Wednesday, the 2nd June, the date on which the boycott is to begin was fixed for the 20th June, and instructions to this effect have been sent to all transport workers&apos; and railwaymen&apos;s unions. The scheme is to cut off all communications whether by rail, sea, post, telegraph or any other means between Hungary and the countries in which this international body has con-connections. The decision of the English National Transport Workers&apos; Federation on the matter is given above. It is reported in certain quarters that this action is not at all welcomed by the masses of the Hungarian population, who will mainly suffer as .a result of it, and who have already suffered from action of a rather similar kind taken against their previous Government.Trade Union Topics.Boilermakers&apos; Society. This society has made an offer to the Newcastle Corporation to invest  30,000 in local housing bonds, subject to the assurance that the bonds may be redeemed at par in the event of a demand being made on the funds of the union, and this offer has been accepted by the Corporation.National Union of Foundry Workers. The National Union of Foundry Workers comes into existence on the 28th June. It will embrace the Friendly Society of Iron-founders, the Amalgamated Society of Coremakers, and the Associated Ironmoulders of Scotland, and will have an approximate membership of 46,000, of which 34,000 are contributed by the Friendly Society of Ironfounders. Its financial position will, however be very weak for a considerable time as a result of the protracted foundry strike of last year.Three moulders&apos; trade unions the Associated Society of Moulders, the Central Ironmoulders&apos; Association, and the Amalgamated Moulders and Kindred Industries Trade Union remain outside the new organisation. They are, however, connected with it through the National Federation of Foundry Unions, which exists partly for the purpose *of promoting amalgamation amongst its constituents.T. J. MACNAMARA.
