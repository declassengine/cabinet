Dickson, C.I.E.I.-General.(a) Authorities. On my recent visit to Hasa to meet Bin Sa&apos;ud (January 29th to February 20th) I went to pains to try and discover as much about the &quot; Akhwan &quot; movement as possible. This I found a rather difficult task as wherever I made enquiries I seemed to be looked upon with suspicion. It was obvious to me that people had been given the hint by some one or other in authority to give away as little as possible. One could not help but come to the conclusion that Bin Saud himself was at the bottom of the matter. I believe now he had issued general instructions that as little as possible regarding the new movement should be divulged to strangers. The reason for this is not far to seek. I think, firstly, Bin Sa&apos;ud is alarmed at the notice which the outside world has taken of the movement; secondly, he is annoyed to think that such advertisement has been brought about by wild and exaggerated reports as to the goings on of the Akhwan; thirdly, he realises that in some quarters the movement is looked upon with distinct distrust and alarm ; and lastly, he does not want it to be known that he himself is at the bottom of the whole thing and is fostering and guiding the movement for his own ends.A good deal of the information I was able to gather, I obtained from the following persons : (a.) Bin Saud himself, in general conversation. (6.) &apos;Abdul Aziz Al Qusaibi &quot;1 (c.) Fahad Al Bassam VMerchants of Hasa.(d.) Sulaiman Al Hawwas   J(e.j Ibrahim bin Juma&apos;, Bin Sa&apos;ud&apos;s confidential servant, (a Shammari) who sawMr. Philby through to Jeddah. (/.) Members of my personal guard, put at my disposal during my stay in Hasa. (g.) Muhammad Etfendi (Kurd) Treasury officer to Bin Juluwi, Hasa. (h.) A member of the Akhwan, whom I was able to do a good turn at Jishah, andwho visited me after dark at least five times.   He was my best informant.(b) Nature of the Movement. Generally speaking from what I saw and heard, one thing appears certain. Akhwanism is not the entirely bad movement it is made out to be. It seems to be a genuine&apos; religious revival, an attempt on the part of the masses of Central Arabia to improve themselves religiously and mentally, and especially is it an attempt to purify Islam of all the many evils which contact with so called European influence has brought in its train. However that may be touching the actual ideas and ambitions of men like Bin Sa&apos;ud, it is certain that the masses are genuinely stirred by a very intense enthusiasm and desire to live better lives. The Akhwan consist principally of the ignorant classes, and the movement may be said to include all. the Beduin (Badiyah) tribes of Najd and adjacent countries. The more educated classes, such as townsmen and merchants, are nearly all orthodox Wahhabis, and though these do not approve of some of* the tenets of the. Akhwan, more especially their earlier intolerance, they consider the movement God-given, and an infinitely preferable state of affairs to the beast-like ignorance and idolatry which existed among the Beduin previously. It is true that the original movement took the most fanatical form, but under the Imam Bin Sa&apos;ud&apos;s firm and tactful guidance it has lost most of its unreasonable, bigotry and its members now devote themselves to self improvement and prayer, where before their only thought was forcible conversion and interference with others. It is on record that when the Akhwan first appeared in the streets of Hufuf, the capital of Hasa, they set upon and beat any women they found in the streets and shot in cold blood many a citizen, whose only crime was that he was seen smoking cigarettes. At that time Bin Sa&apos;ud and Bin Juluwi, the Amir of Hasa, had summarily to shoot several of the Akhwan before they could bring them to their senses. Things, however, are vastly changed now, and both Bin Sa&apos;ud and his lieutenants have the movement well in hand. The only possible way in which the movement could break out again and get out of control would be for some deep and universal resentment of a religious nature to take place.   At the present moment suchio   1428  100  5.20  j.o.*.   [3107]
exists, in the form of Najdis not being allowed to sro to Mecca. Government would do well not to neglect the storm clouds which are gathering. This is the only anxiety Bin Sa&apos;ud has at the present moment in his dealings with the Akhwan. He is anxious about the future, and his repeated requests to me to warn His Majesty&apos;s Government about the high feeling that was running throughout Najd was a sufficient indication of Bin Sa&apos;ud&apos;s state of mind. Finally, in a general sense, Akhwanism may be said to be a revival of Wahhahism. It is, however, in no sense a heresy, but an ascetic movement among Moslems to revive the Salifi school of Sunniism, as taught by the Imam Ahmad. At the present moment, as I mentioned above, it may be said to have chiefly affected the Beduin of Central Arabia, as opposed to the more educated townspeople. Bin Sa&apos;ud himself is at the head of the movement, and on one occasion, when 1 asked about the Akhwan, he said, &quot; I am the Akhwan.&quot; Bin Sa&apos;ud himself told me that the Akhwan were practically the same as the Wahhabis. &quot; To-day Wahhabism.cum-Akhwanism was the purest of all religions in the world,&quot; said Bin Sa&apos;ud, &quot; its members were to be found all over Central Arabia &quot; According to Bin Sa&apos;ud, the attack on the Wahhabis by Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian, in 1817, by order of the Sultan, was not so much because the religion of Najd offended as that a personal insult had been offered to the Sultanah of Turkey by the Amir of Najd, who ordered her caravan to turn back from Madina. At the time, however, it was considered by Turkey to be a political move to make out that Wahhabism was a menace to orthodox Islam. As we know, the result of Ibrahim Pasha&apos;s campaign in Najd in 1817 was the destruction of Dharaiyah. the capital, and the carrying off of the Amir Abdullah ibn-Sa&apos;ud to Egypt. This crushed Wahhabism for a time and rendered Najd innocuous as a menace to orthodox Islam, as the Sultan knew it. Wahhabism, however, has existed throughout Najd and in parts of Oman, Trucial Coast, Hasa and elsewhere, ever since, though not in a militant form.11. A Short History of Akhwanism.(1) The actual date of the new revival under the name of Akriwan is difficult to determine. Certain it is that up to five years ago the term &quot; Akhwan &quot; was practically unknown.&apos; It is also certain that the few members of the sect, though existing in the township of Artawiyah, always a fanatical spot, played no part in the recovery of Najd by &apos;Abdul &apos;Aziz, the present Imam, in 190&apos;J. It vyas only after 1913 when Bin Sa&apos;ud, the present ruler, recovered Hasa from the Turks that the movement first came under his notice. In 1914-15 the term came into general use, and began to spread to an alarming extent. It was then that Bin Sa&apos;ud decided to turn his attention ^to Akhwanism as a means of strengthening and consolidating his power over the many disruptive elements which he had to, contend with in Najd and his new dominions generally. To-day the principal religious leader of the Akhwanism is Shaikh &apos;Abdul Karim-al-Mughrabi. This individual was, at one time, Chief &apos;italian to the late Palih Pasha Al Sadun, Shaikh of the Muntafiq. He later became &apos;italian to Mizal Pasha, father of the present Ibrahim Beg Al Sa&apos;dun. He left the latter&apos;s service, however, and departed to Najd, where he ensconced himself as &apos;italian in the town of Artawiyah, a small nest of Wahhabism. There is a story that in the year 1899, when. Miz&apos;al Pasha went to Mecca, he returned via Najd, and on his way visited Artawiyah. In place of a welcome, as he expected from his old friend, &apos;Abdul Karim, the latter rudely drove him away, cursing him for a &quot; Kafir&quot; and a &quot; Mushrik.&quot; Among other Akhwan religious leaders we have Ibn &apos;Abdul,Latif, Qadhi of Riyadh and Shaikh &apos;Isa, Qadhi of Hasa.(2) That the present Ruler of Najd, Bin Sa&apos;ud, has been forced to associate himself with the movement and became its leader, I think, there is little doubt. In my opinion he, in the first place, thought to make use of the movement to strengthen his position, but in the end found he was forced to spread its doctrines and become its leader lest he should go under himself. ]jb would appear that in about 1915 or 1916 Bin Sa&apos;ud found that Akhwanism was definitely getting control of affairs in Najd. He saw he had to decide between being a temporal ruler and crushing Akhwanism or becoming the leader of a new kind of Wahhabism. He deoided on the latter course as being the less risky. Having once taken them up he saw that it was vital ^ to get the members of the new cult under proper control. There was a danger of their running &quot; amuck&quot; both in the direction of Hijaz and &apos;Iraq. He issued his famous order in 1916 that all Beduins of Najd and Arabia must join the movement and must pay.him &quot;Zikafas their recognised leader. This led to much fighting, and was incidently one of the reasons leading up&apos;to the &apos;Aj man tribes resisting him in Hasa in 1915.   It may.be said,
that Bin Sa&apos;ud during 191(1-17-18 was engaged in one continuous series of wars with his recalcitrant tribesmen, and rarely was he able to visit Riyadh during this time and earn a well deserved rest. In 1918 Bin Sand had already forced all the Beduin of Najd (except the &apos;Ajman) to adopt Akhwauism and recognise him as their Imam. In order to ensure these tribes behaving themselves and remaining under his control Bin Sa&apos;ud got his religious leaders to is^ue a Fatwah that it was necessary that Akhwan should build themselves cities and till the soil, this being incumbent on them from a religious point of view and a necessary measure to divide them from the &quot;jahl&quot; (ignorant ones), the term given to those Beduin who had not. adopted Akhwanism. The order appears to have been responded to with enthusiasm in most cases, and already Bin Sa&apos;ud tells me there are fifty-three new cities in Najd which have all come into being within the last four years. The progress of the movement from step to step has been most cleverly managed, and Bin Saud has showed great genius in working his scheme out without estranging his people. Nay, more, lie has been able to instil a wonderful enthusiasm for Akhwanism among the Beduin, until to-day all are anxious to join the movement. It has now become a matter cf pride with a Beduin to call himself a &quot; Hadhar,&quot; or town-dweller, as opposed to the term &quot;jahil&quot; (ignorant one). The skill with which the tribes have been forced into the movement and compelled to settle down and plough without feeling resentment at the change shows Bin Sa&apos;ud to be no ordinary leader. He has given the wandering tribes a stake in the land, so to speak, and has definitely made them &quot;settled&quot; tribesmen, while he has left the system sufficiently elastic to allow of portions of each tribe to remain throughout the year in the desert tending their camels and looking after the breeding of same. The selection of the site of each new town is made entirely by Bin Saud himself, and in accordance with whether the tribe is a difficult one to manage or otherwise, he places them near or far from Riyadh, his capital. Incidentally the reason why the &apos;Ajman tribe has been so long in coming in is because of their knowledge of Bin Sa&apos;ud&apos;s determination to &quot; bring them to heel&quot; thoroughly and in a fashion all his own. This is to take more or less the following form, and to one who knows the Beduin is a really harsh punishment: the Ajman are to be transferred to Najd as a whole, and are there to be broken up, each of the twenty different sections of the tribe being split up among the different new townships of the Akhwan. In this manner their power for doing evil will be broken. Bin Saud tells me himself that they twice played the traitor to him once in the fight with Bin Rashid near Majma&apos; in March 1915, and once again in 1916, when they attacked and nearly overcame him in Hasa. Since then they have been successfully playing fast and loose with him, sometimes living in Kuwait territory and sometimes in British. They are now near Zubair, and have practically come to terms with Bin Saud. As a matter of fact, from subsequent conversation I have had with Bin Sa&apos;ud, I rather gather he is prepared to mitigate the punishment outlined above.   He realises that he could perhaps carry severity too far.To go back to the growth of the movement, the methods of Bin Sa&apos;ud would seem to have been something as follows with a tribe that was not of itself anxious to become Akhwan. He would send for the Shaikh and tell him in blunt terms that his tribe had no religion and that they were all &quot; Juhl.&quot; He next would order the Shaikh to attend the local school of &apos;Ulama, which was attached to the great mosque in Riyadh, and there undergo a course of instruction in religion. At the same time half a dozen &apos;Ulama, attended by some genuinely fanatical Akhwan, such as Al Duwaish, the Shaikh of the Mutair, were sent off to the tribe itself. These held daily classes teaching the people all about Islam in its original simplicity. Much enthusiasm was then aroused in the tribe, and. the teachers were careful &quot;to appeal to&quot; the sleeping fanaticism inherent among all simple and serious savage men. The teachers insisted on all new converts wearing a white turban over their head-dress, and, among other things, they filled the new converts with wonderful ideas regarding the &quot; Imam.&quot; To them he is their father, spiritual leader, and shaikh, all in one. Those who joined the new movement (tadaiyanu) were told they were now members of the new brotherhood, and so the name &quot; Akhwan &quot; arose. These &apos;Ulama are, of course, very carefully selected by the Imam for loyalty to himself before everything.When the Shaikh of the tribe was supposed to have received sufficient religious instruction, he was invited to build a house in Riyadh and remain in attendance on the Imam. This .again was part of the control scheme. Should Bin Sa&apos;ud to-day desire to mobilize his Akhwan forces, he merely gives the word to this bodyguard of Shaikhs;and the country side is in aiflame inside 50 hours.(3) Prayer. Much importance is attached to this, and it is part of the Akhwan creed that men should pray together.   The result is remarkable.   At the call to prayer^
on all sides you hear men shouting out &quot;Arise, you lazy ones, get up and pray.&quot; A group is then formed and a leader appointed, and prayers are said in regular military style. If there are a large number of men, such as 100 or more, the sight is quite impressive. I myself have seen Bin Sa&apos;ud&apos;s bodyguard of 500 Akhwan saying prayers, and was greatly struck with the military precision of their movements. Added to this, the fierce, fanatical abandon of the leader of the prayers made one realise the danger of the force behind the movement.III. Beliefs.(1) An akh (brother) puts before everything else two things : (a) Worship of One God.   (h) Brotherhood among all true believers.Under (a) actual articles of faith required of him: (1) Indivisibility of God (to say there is no god but God). (2) Zikat, giving of. (3) Fasting, Al-Ramadhan. (4) Charity to poor.   (5) Haj, Mecca.Under (6) actual articles of faith required of him: (1) Worship of country. (2) Implicit obedience to Imam. (3) Help his brother Akhwan, whether in financial difficulty or otherwise.(2) A man should always say God is God and Muhammad his prophet, but it is forbidden to think of or use the name of Muhammad as an interceder with God. God is all that matters ; Muhammad is only a man who gave out God&apos;s word. He is dead and gone and has no further significance, except of course that his name should be spoken with reverence and his memory kept alive out of gratitude.(3) Zikat requires every subject to give annually one in ten of all he possesses to. the Imam. The latter distributes money so collected among the poor and needy as he thinks fit. This is not to be confused with the paying of revenue, though the Beduin like to confuse the two.(4) To couple any other name with God in prayer is an abominable sin, such, for instance, as the names of Husain, Hasan, &amp;c. To do this is to be a &quot; mushrik.&quot; Such a person is a kafir, and his possessions, life, women, &amp;c, are &quot;halal.&quot; Shfahs come under this category.(5) The offering of vows, &quot; Nadhr,&quot; as commonly practised among Shiahs and some Sunnis, is a deadly sin.&apos; (6) The erection of tombs or monuments over the graves of the dead is a sin. Hence the Akhwan&apos;s duty is always to destroy such if found.(7) Smoking tobacco is a deadly sin, as also the smoking of hashish, opium, &amp;c. If he sees a man smoking, an akh will assault and probably kill him. Throughout Bin Sa&apos;ud&apos;s kingdom smoking is strictly forbidden. (Exception : Hasa, where people may smoke in private.)(8) The drinking of alcohol is forbidden, and is treated in same way as in (7).(9) If an akh is in debt, he has only to go to his companions and inform them. These will pass the hat round, collect the necessary money, and pay the debt off at once. tIV. Other Customs, Observances and Befiefs among Akhwan.(a) The belief is held that the present is the period immediately preceding the second coming of Christ.(b) Houses must be of only one storey.(c) Simplicity of living and dress is to be enforced. (Most Akhwan present a most ragged appearance.)(d) A white turban is to be worn instead of the &apos;Aqal as a sign manifest that you are a brother. The Imam has since issued orders that this is not necessary, but the custom continues among all the newly-converted Akhwan. All the Imam&apos;s followers whom I saw recently in Hasa wore the white turban. The Imam himself and his bodyguard of negroes wore the &apos;Aqal, as also did the garrison (&apos;Askar) of Hasa, though these admitted to me, when.questioned, that they were all good Akhwan.(e) Salaams are not returned except to another akh. This was very marked in Hasa. My Sunni Moslem companions from Bahrain regularly salaamed to any Akhwan they met in the streets, but only once did I notice the answer &quot;&apos;alaikum al .salam &quot; given.   Usually the salutation was utterly ignored.(/) If a Kafir or Mushrik meet a group of Akhwan in the streets, the latter cover their faces with both hands, rather than be poluted by sight. This was done to me on scores of occasions in Hufuf, and even inside the Imam&apos;s own house and by members of
this own bodyguard. It was the more remarkable as the Imam himself was always most cordial and regularly returned my salaam in public.(g) Whenever I happened to enter a majlis in which there were Akhwan present, these at once left the room in a body.(h) Fanaticism is still very marked among some of the Akhwan and without the Imam&apos;s protecting influence, 1 should probably have had a poor time in Hasa. Over and over again, as one passed an &quot; akh &quot; you heard him murmuring under his breath the well known &quot;There is no power or glory except in God, &amp;c, &amp;c.&quot; At the same time one could not take offence; on the contrary, one felt great pity for these poor men, firstly, because their fanaticism was not of the aggressive type; and secondly, because one felt intense earnestness and desire to live a good life dominated all their thoughts.(i) Practically speaking, all the Beduin of Najd are Akhwan now, though, as I said above, only the newly initiated and a few townsmen wear the white head-dress. I asked some of Ibn Juiuwis men who came to Ojair to meet me if they were Akhwan. They answered &quot; of course, but we have been for some time now, and therefore have discarded the turban.&quot;(j) The Shi&apos;ah population of Hasa is forbidden to smoke even in their own houses, or have readings in the Husainiyahs. Failure to obey the rules is visited with the direst penalties. Many Shi&apos;ahs in the past have been murdered by the Akhwan. But now things have changed, and the Shiahs, provided they conform to the smoking and drinking laws, enjoy full freedom and protection. On the whole their lot is better than under the Turks, for to-day they get protection from the Beduin ; in the Turkish times they could not call their lives their own, much less their property. In the last &quot;five years the prosperity of Hasa has increased 100 per cent.(k) Forcible proselytising was an article of faith among the Akhwan up to a short time ago. It was their methods in this matter which caused such consternation among the people of Hijaz and surrounding countries. Bin Sa&apos;ud tells me he never countenanced these acts at all from the first, but was unable to stop them till the end of 1919. To-day all forcible conversion or spreading of the faith by the sword has been definitely abandoned. Bin Sa&apos;ud, I am told, about six months ago passed the strictest orders on the subject. In public majlis he explained that such acts would only bring down the wrath of God and of friendly nations on to Najd. Bin Sa&apos;ud himself told me that he had been compelled to execute several Akhwan for disobedience to his orders in this respect. The Akhwan, he said, were 90 per cent, better and more amenable to-day than they had been two years ago. Great strides were being made daily, and strong civilising elements were at work, which, he hoped, would entirely alter the character of the people of Najd in the next few years. Such a thing as forcible conversion was not a thing to be surprised at from a nation who had suddenly found religion, so to speak. His people, said Bin Sa&apos;ud, had the purest form of religion in the world to-day. All that was the matter was that those whose hearts had been touched were some of the wildest and most ignorant of all human beings. Their new religion had to be given them gently and not all at once. Its purity would always remain the same, he hoped. It was natural, he thought, that men who had never before heard the simple teachings of the Quran should go off their heads to start with. Bin Sa&apos;ud assured me that so ignorant had the Beduin of Najd been in the past that until the new revival came 90 per cent, of them had never heard of religion, marriages had never been solemnised and circumcision had been unknown.y. System of Bin Sa Ws Government and its Connection with the Akhwan.(a) Administration. Bin Sa&apos;ud&apos;s dominions were divided up into provinces, over each he had appointed a Hakim (Amir) whose duties were preservation of order and collection of Zikat. Every town in the province was self governing, and had its own elected Amir also.   The latter was responsible for law and order inside the town area.(b) Judicial.- Shari&apos;ah Law was the only law that was recognised throughout Bin Sa&apos;ud&apos;s territories now. Both Akhwan, Najdi and Hasawi were treated alike in the matter. Qadhis had been appointed in every big city, and the Amir of the province or cities, as the case might be, sent all cases for trial to the Qadhi. The latter passed sentences according to the strictest letter of the law, and the Amir saw such was carried out. As Sultan in&apos; Najd Bin Sa&apos;ud could overrule the Shariah decisions, but only in his capacity as Sultan (Amr al Sultan nafidh).Mutilation was practised, if Shariah ordered it, and the place for execution was usually the public market. In Hufuf it was on Thursdays. The body of a decapitated criminal was allowed to remain twelve hours in the market square for people to see.[3107] C
Tribal laws and customs, such as &quot;Dakhalah&quot; (refuge), &quot;Fasal&quot; (blood-money), &amp;c., were not recognised either by Bin Sa&apos;ud, his Qudhis, or his Amirs.(c) Military. Bin Sa&apos;ud kept up a small standing army of regularly paid soldiers. Each province had its garrison, and the chief strategical points were held by these men. The garrison of each province came under the direct orders of the Hakim. Ibn Juluwi in Hasa had 700 men to keep order with, distributed as under. Hufuf 500, Mubarraz 200.   These so-called regulars are half mounted, half dismounted.Bin Sa&apos;ud&apos;s chief strength lay in his Akhwan (Badiyahj forces. These numbered 300,000 men, he reckoned. He could mobilise these in an incredibly short time if the war was a Jihad, such us it would be if it were against the Sharif.Rifle practice was regularly carried out under the eye of the Hakims of the provinces ; also individuals were encouraged to hold private matches. Rifles in use among regular &apos;Askar were all of small-bore magazine type (Mauzer mostly). The Badiyah possessed every type of rifle, though the majority had small-bore weapons. I saw many 30*3 Mauzer, Manlicher among them.(d) Revenue-For the collection of Zikat and Miri from the settled population, the Governors of Hakims of the provinces were responsible. At present Bin Sa&apos;ud himself collected Zikat from the Akhwan, both those who dwelt in towns, and those out with camels. Bin Sa&apos;ud allowed no one but himself to interfere in this matter as a matter of policy. He himself toured round all Akhwan settlements every three months, and kept himself in closest touch with their leaders. Bin Sa&apos;ud told me his revenue did not at present cover his expenditure. He did. not know what he would do if His Majesty&apos;s Government reduced his subsidy. He would be faced with lawlessness again, he thought. He was improving his taxation and financial position fast, but it would be long before he could show a proper budget. His future hopes lay in the ports of Ojair and Jubail and customs accruing therefrom. He wished to discourage entirely goods coming from Hijaz as he got no benefit, but with two good ports of his own on the east coast and properly managed customs, he hoped to make 40 lakhs of rupees annually.   But this was not yet.A tribe that paid Zikat to Bin Sa&apos;ud ipso facto could claim absolute protection from all its enemies. Hence the desire of many tribes in Oman, Trucial coast, Yaman, Shammar to pay the tax,   It meant they were guaranteed from raids.(e) The following is a list of the^new towns that have arisen in Najd under the Akhwan movement: Al Artawiyah.
