Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    y(1) I wish to draw the attention of the cabinet again to this question which was raised in my memorandum of 11th November last (C.P.102).(2) As stated therein this camp was formed inAugust 1918 and contained at the time of my memo, nearly 50,000 refugees of whom 30,000 were Christian Assyrians from Kurdistan and the remainder Armenians from other parts of the Ottoman Empire. The cost was at that time estimated at  6,500 per day or no less than  2,372,500 per annum.(3) This expenditure had been provisionally met from Army funds but a decision as to the ultimate incidence of charge had not been reached.   I suggested that the Foreign Office should be made responsible and that the Secretary of Stats for Foreign Affairs be requested in consultation with the Secretary of State for India and the Army Council, to devote his immediate attention to the problem of securing effective economies,(a) by repatriation, or(b) by local settlement, of the refugees, combined with(c) reduction of current expenditure on maintenance, closer supervision of rations, etc., and by putting all who are physically fit to some use-ful t )jm of work.I also suggested that Armenian refugees fromCilicia etc., should either be repatriated or their cost reclaimed from the French Government.
(4)     In his memorandum of 24th November (CP.192) theSecretary &quot;of State for Foreign Affairs commentedon these suggestions and expressed the view that itwas impracticable.to make the Foreign Officefinancially responsible for this expenditure, andthat the charge should fall finally on.Army&apos;Funds.(5) In a letter ta me of 12th December the secretaryof State for war said that while he was willing that the local military authorities should act as agents for the foreign^n Office the War office should not be finally responsible for the camp,since they had not and could not have the controlof the policy which dictated this expenditure andthe steps necessary to terminate it.(6) As however no final decision had been reachedwhen the Estimates were prepared  643,000 was included in Army Estimates 192o-l covering 4 months expenditure upon the camp, without pre-(juaice to the question of final charge. &apos;(7) The difficulties in the way of repatriatingthese refugees are still acute.   The 30,000 Assyrians have been removed to Mosul but are unable to proceed to their homes in the Tjrumia district which is in the hands of the Kurds,The Armenians are similarly^unable to reach Erivan. No definite information is available as to the other steps bein.3 taken to reduce expenditure and it has not been found possible to recover any part of it from the French Government..
(8) At a conference held at the treasury on 4th June between the Financial secretaries to the Treasury and the War Office and the -Under-Sec re tar y of  tats fox- Foreign Affairs-it was agreed by the War Office to accept the  643,000 provided in this years Army Estimates and the expenditure in previous years as a final charge against Army Votes on the understanding that they should not incur any further liability,I submit that the Cabinet should confirm this decision and should direct   (1) that no further expenditure should be incurred upon these refugees beyond what can be met from the  643,000 already provided; and (2) that the Departments concerned, namely the Foreign Office, the India&quot; Office and the war Office should confer forthwith with a view to devising measures for bringing this expenditure at once to an end?(Intd.) A*C.Treasury, S.W.11th June, 1920.
