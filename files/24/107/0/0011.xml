Military Secret. 1391From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India, c2nd June 1920. (Repeated to -Minister, Tehran, and Malmiss.) (Received 3rd.)Priority A.6917. Your telegram No. nil of 5th May re withdrawal of Meshed force. We presume that mission and consular escort at Meshed will be maintained from Tehran after force has been withdrawn, as was case in pre-war days.Alternative line of maintenance from Duzdap is so unreliable that we deprecate its use, and we could not undertake maintenance of escort unless road is kept in constant state of repair, is adequately protected and posts provided at regular intervals for protection of convoys en route. We propose, moreover, that ultimately the escort at Meshed should bo round from the Indian troops which we furnish for the post-war garrison in Mesopotamia.We will arrange to furnish and maintain consular escort in Seistan.Arrangements for withdrawal are in progress but no move can take place until water arrangements are complete.   You will be kept accruainted with situation.
