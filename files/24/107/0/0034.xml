[Ting Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government!]Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1920.CONFIDENTIAL.FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF THE MIDDLE EAST.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.1. THE events of the war have precipitated an issue which has long been impending, viz., the regulation of the policy and administration of the countries lying between the western frontiers or outskirts of India and the eastern end of the Mediterranean. Our responsibilities in these regions have been greatly increased by the imposition upon us of the Mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine, by the creation of an independent State of the Hejaz, by the probable emergence of a quasi-independent State of Syria, by the closer relations into which we shall inevitably be brought in the future with countries such as Kurdistan and Armenia, by the obliga-tions that we have assumed in connection with Persia, and by the new complexion of our policy with regard to Egypt. There is a general recognition in every paper so far submitted that, to deal with this situation, a new machinery is required; and that no existing Office, as at present constituted, is fully qualified for the task.2. I have for years been of the opinion that there should one day be a Department of the Middle East, with a Secretary of State at the head, and an administrative service of its own, which it should recruit and control. To such a Department under such a head might safely be transferred the management of our relations with an independent Kingdom such as Persia, or a quasi-independent Protectorate such as Egypt neither of which would consent to be placed under either the India Office or the Colonial Office, because they would fear the loss of importance or influence which such an association might be held to involve. I understand that this solution is favoured in theory both by Mr. Montagu and by the group of Members of Parliament who have addressed a Note to the Prime Minister. On the other hand, it may be held that, in the present state of our finances, the creation of an entirely new Ministry with a Secretary of State at its head is inexpedient; while it ma\ also be argued that, if the newly mandated territories (Palestine and Mesopotamia) pass at a comparatively early stage from the Mandate status to that of independence, the need for so costly a mechanism will no longer exist. It may be thought therefore that a less elaborate rearrangement will suffice provided always that all the terri-tories and interests affected shall be grouped under a single departmental head and shall be administered by a single service. It is upon these general lines that my colleagues have noted. What should this department be, or what form should such a department, if it be not identical with any now in existence, assume ? That is the question which we have to answer.3. There appears to be a general consensus that it should not be the India Office : and in this opinion the India Office itself concurs. Not only has the Secretary of State for India responsibilities sufficient for the shoulders of any one man responsi-bilities which are likely to increase as time goes on, not, I hope, in range or extent, but in complexity and anxiety; but the countries concerned would greatly resent being placed under Indian control, both because they regard with often exaggerated suspicion the methods of Indian administration and the traditions of Indian officialdom, and because they would fear the possibility of Indian immigration or Indian competition in trade.4. Mr. Churchill prefers the Colonial Office, but I think must be very imperfectly acquainted with the views or interests of the States of the Middle East, if he thinks that such a transference would be contentedly acquiesced in by them, or would lead to an immediate solution of the difficulties by which we are confronted. The work that the Colonial Office has done in East Africa and elsewhere, to which he refers in terms of well-merited eulogy, does not bear the remotest resemblance to that which will arise in the countries of the Middle East. In the one case we have been dealing as a rule with native tribes, commonly in a very backward-state of civilisation, with few or no traditions of sovereignty or independence, and with none of the organisa-143  [3453]
lion of a civilised State. In the other case we shall have to manage States with an ancient history and a high conceit of their own importance, such as Persia; communities as advanced, ambitious, and cosmopolitan in outlook as the Jews and Egyptians; countries which are and will continue to be as much the focus of interna-tional rivalry and competition as Arabia and Syria; interests which will for years to come require constant appeals to the Foreign Office and delicate handling by the Foreign Secretary, whatever his degree of connection with, or responsibility for, the new Department may be. It is safe to say that a lethal blow would be dealt at the pride of Egypt if it were to be placed under the Colonial Office; and that the mandated territories would utter a cry of rage if their condition were, by even the implication of a misnomer, to be assimilated with that of British Colonies. Again, when Mr. Churchill points to the successful results that have followed the taking over of African and other Protectorates from the Foreign Office by the Colonial Office in the past, he omits to recall that, in nearly every one of these cases, the burden of the early years, when acquisition was taking place and foreign complications, often of the most anxious nature, were being straightened out, was borne by the Foreign Office, and that the Colonial Office entered into an inheritance which others had won and nursed through an early and often tempestuous youth.5. Again, while the Foreign Office has in its service a very large number of administrators and experts possessing Oriental experience, and speaking Oriental languages (Arabic, Persian, Turkish), the Colonial Office is necessarily almost wholly unequipped in these respects, and could only slowly and laboriously acquire the staff and the experience which would enable it to grapple satisfactorily with such problems as those of the Middle East.6. Like others of my colleagues, I look forward to the day when the Colonial Office will probably part with its control of the great self-governing Dominions to a new Imperial Department of State; and I have long held that the Privy Council, with its traditions, its name, the titular precedence of its official head, and its existing connection with the Dominions, in respect of the Judicial Committee, is marked out for the purpose. But it does not follow from this that the remaining functions of the Colonial Office, namely, the management of the Crown Colonies and the British Protectorates in Africa and elsewhere, will best be combined with the control of a great Eastern sphere, with which the Colonial Office, its staff and its services have hitherto had. nothing to do. Indeed, it is a matter of knowledge that the administration of Cyprus by the Colonial Office which is its sole Middle Easter^ responsibility has not resulted in anything like that development of the island which its interests and opportunities demand. The Department of the Middle East will have, to a large extent, to be a specialised Department, attracting to its service a particular type of ability, knowledge, training, and experience.7. Mr. Churchill, as has been pointed out by Mr. Montagu, seems to be un-acquainted with what has been passing in Mesopotamia. Had he been present at the meetings of the Eastern Committee, he would have known that the Foreign Office has had nothing to say to the expansion of our responsibilities in those regions, except in so far as the Chairman of that Committee, who happens to be myself, has on a score of occasions laboured to contract the area of responsibility into which an almost exclusively military administration has dragged us, and to prevent the extension of our activities into regions where he seems to think that the Foreign Office wishes to spread itself of malice prepense, but where in reality in the majority of cases it has not the slightest desire to go. When he says that &quot; the Foreign Office, rather than the India Office or the War Office, gives the directing influence, and that the political officers under the civil administration push out into all sorts of remote regions on various pretexts,&quot; he seems to be unaware that the civil administration has been exclusively Indian, that the remote districts have been penetrated because the military insisted upon it, that the Foreign Office has had nothing to do with the matter at all. except when the activities of the military have involved us in foreign complications, and that, if the Foreign Office were disestablished to-morrow, not a single one of the difficulties of which he complains would be diminished or would disappear; on the contrary, they would be almost immeasurably augmented. - -8. The Foreign Office has assuredly no desire to add to its already overwhelming labours, or to undertake administrative duties for which it does not profess to be fitted. If I were dispensed altogether to-morrow from having any say to the present or the future of these regions, I should breathe a sigh of intense and jubilant relief. But let not my colleagues imagine for a moment that, by a decision of the Cabinet or by a stroke of the pen, this can be effected. The immediate future of Egypt, with all the negotiations with foreign Powers in respect of the Capitulations, the Mixed
Tribunals, the Caisse de la Dette, and the like, will involve an immense strain upon the Foreign Office. Palestine, with the jealous and complex interests of foreign Powers arising out of their ecclesiastical pretensions, their commercial interests, and their acute rivalry, will give us a great deal of anxiety. The League of Nations, to whom the Mandatory will be responsible, will hold the Foreign Office answerable for explanation or defence. The Zionists throughout the world will look to us for the protection of their interests and the reconciliation of their position with that of the Arab inhabitants of Palestine, a problem which must in any case be dealt with by the Foreign Office, since it brings us into sharp and immediate contact with the French in Syria and with Feisal at Damascus. For the execution of the Peace Treaty with Turkey, with its infinite opportunities for international complication, the Foreign Office will have to answer, at any rate for some years &amp;to come.9. Let me give to my colleagues a single illustration of a situation that is sure to arise. On the north-west frontiers of India lies Afghanistan, hitherto almost exclusively in the Indian orbit, but certain, as time goes on and it secures diplomatic representatives in foreign countries (for we have practically now surrendered all control over its foreign relations) to be brought into closer contact with the Foreign Office. On the near side of Afghanistan lies Persia, which must remain under the Foreign Office so long as it is an independent kingdom, with foreign Legations stationed at Tehran and with its own diplomatic representation in foreign capitals. North of these countries lies Turkestan, now a focus of Bolshevik agitation and intrigue, and an active breeding-ground of Foreign Office anxieties for years to come. Next to Persia on the west lies Mesopotamia, whose problems of security, of frontier defence, and of trade will be closely bound up with those of Persia. Is it seriously proposed to leave Afghanistan under the divided control of the India Office and the Foreign Office, to leave Persia under the Foreign Office, but to place Mesopotamia under the Colonial Office? No present overlapping of functions or conflict of jurisdiction would be comparable with the friction produced by such a system or lack of system.For these reasons it seems to me impossible to dispense with the Foreign Office connection at any rate at the present stage. If the attempt were made, it would merely mean that the work would have to be done twice over, and that there would be general confusion. At the same time, I realise that the Foreign Office, as at present constituted is inadequate to the task, and that in addition to all the foreign anxieties that will overwhelm us in the initial years, much administrative work will have to be done for which special aptitude and experience will be necessary10. I therefore propose that there should be created a separate Middle East Department, with a Parliamentary Under-Secretary to represent it in the House of Commons, subordinate and responsible to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, much as the head of the Department of Overseas Trade is an Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office and in the last resort takes his orders from the Secretary of State. Such ,a Department would have Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Palestinian, Persian and Arabian Sections with officials of local and administrative experience, who as time passes on would be drawn from the services instituted in those countries, there being a constant interchange of talent and experience between them. Failing the discovery of a neighbouring building, the Department would have to be housed for the present in the Foreign Office, where indeed the majority of the officials dealing with these areas already are. Later on, when the existing Colonial Department has assumed its final shape, the Department will probably overflow into the present Colonial Office. As is well known, the Foreign Office is already so crowded that all the big rooms once available for receptions or purposes of State are now partitioned into sections for the accommodation of a grossly overcrowded staff.11. For the service of the new department, however, a new Service of the Middle East is essential. At present in addition to the Foreign and Diplomatic Services (now amalgamated) and the General Consular Service, there is a special Levant Service, applicable to the Ottoman Dominions, Persia, Greece and Morocco (just as there is a Far Eastern Service for China, Japan and Siam). There are also special administrative Services for Egypt and the Soudan. The bulk of these would require to be amalgamated into a special Middle Eastern Service, to deal with the whole of the areas under the new Department, with sections dedicated to the various countries, according as a Turkish or Arabic speaking official was required. Thero mighit be interchange, but there would also require to be specialisation.12. I have not raised the minor questions whether the Soudan should continue to be united or partially united with Egypt and should fall within the new adminis-tration or whether it should now or later be taken over by the Colonial Office, not
ofeeling sure how far its problems will in the future have an Egyptian or a Central African orientation. Nor have I discussed whether Cyprus should be added as I think it probably ought to be to the new Department. Lord Milner will give us much more authoritative advice upon, both questions. Nor have I at this stage attempted to draw a line of division between the spheres of the Ottoman Kingdom of the future and the Middle East, not being at all sure in what shape the former will survive.13. With one suggestion, however, that has been made, I concur. I think that it will be necessary to have an Eastern Committee, or something like it, to co-ordinate the interests and work of the various Departments that will for many years to come be concerned in the administration of the Middle East. They are the foreign Office, India Office, War &quot;Office, Admiralty, Air Force, and Treasury. I doubt if the Cabinet is at all fully aware what the activities of this Committee in its various forms have been during the last three and a-half years, or of the extent to which it has relieved the Cabinet of the labours and responsibilities of Middle Eastern politics. In the successive garbs of the Mesopotamian Administration Committee, Persian Com-mittce, Middle East Committee, Eastern Committee, and Inter-Departmental Conference on the Middle East, this body, over whose deliberations I have had the honour to preside throughout, has held 120 meetings, with an average duration of over two hours each, since January 1917, and the general condition of the Middle East during that period, in spite of some startling vicissitudes, until the collapse of Denikin and the appearance of the Bolsheviks as a militarist and aggressive force, has furnished a not unfavourable comment upon its labours.14. But to render it a really effective instrument of co-ordination, responsible Heads or Representatives of Departments should attend. The Foreign and Indian Secretaries should always be, as they have hitherto been, members. The War Office should be represented, if not by the Secretary of State, at any rate by the C.I.G.S. &apos; or D.M.I. or D.M.O. The functions of the Committee, by whatever name it be called, should continue to be political and deliberative, not administrative; and the superior authority of the Cabinet should in no circumstances be impugned.15. The advice which I give to the Cabinet therefore is this :-1. That a Middle Eastern Department be created.2. That if it be considered inexpedient or premature at the present juncture to constitute this Department a Ministry, and to place it under a separate Secretary of State, the Department be placed provisionally under a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, responsible to and taking his orders from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.3. That a Middle Eastern Service be created for the areas concerned.4. That a permanent co-ordinating Committee be set up.These recommendations do not differ in essence (except intone particular) from those in the India Office memorandum of the 1st June./C./, jJ+OSl^Foreign Office, June 8, 1920.C. of K.
