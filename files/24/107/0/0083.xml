(P 4690)       From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,15th June 1920.Clear the line.Your telegram of 13th June, 732, makes me rather &quot;anxious. If I understand aright, Mussoorie Conference takes shape of informal discussions without definite agenda paper. I realise therefore that it may be difficult to exclude Turkish Treaty from discussion. I also realise - political importance of having Amir on our side as against Indian Moslem extremists. But I hope you will impress on Dobbs necessity of holding firmly to fundamental position that Afghanistan having for its own purposes chosen to remain neutral during war, has no locus standi whatever as between Allies and Turkey, and that however much Government of India may sympathise with Moslems in their religious difficulty, we cannot allow Turkish peace terms to &quot;be made a factor in regulating our relations with Afghanistan./     ,   -  -\
