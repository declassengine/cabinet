COPY Off LijTTEii Wdli THL. THUbUHY TO THE MIMsTHY 01 ----------------- .PEKSIOKS. ^TKSaSUEY CHAMBERS, 22nd June, 1920.JSir, . ;.; s)I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty1 s Treasury your letter of the 16th instant (12878/1) enclosing a joint memorandum relative to a bonus on war pensions prepared by the Minister of Pensions and Minister of Labour.In reply I ara to request you to call the attention of the Minister of Pensions to the reply given by the Lord Privy Seal to a Parliamentary question by Mr. Charles White on the 16th instant.   The terms of this reply which My Lords un&amp;er-stand were considered by the Cabinet make it clear that His Majesty^ Government are not prepared to re-open the settlement made last Autumn and embodied in the Eoyal Warrant as to the adjustment of war pensions with the cost of living.   The objections to any such proposals are set out briefly in the reply and must, idy Lords consider, be held to apply to the scheme now recommended by the Minister of Pensions and the Minister of Labour.   I am   to add the following observations on the special features of that scheme.1.   The present proposal does not in terms amount to an all round increase of pensions for it is limited to certain classes only, viz; men in receipt of total disablement pension, widows over 40 or having children under their care and dependants in receipt of a pension based on need.   Nevertheless the proposal is open to many objections.   It is one 3ided because it involves payment of a bonus in respect of a rise in the cost of living though had the circumstances been reversed and the cost of living fallen, there would have been no reduction in pension.. If the concession is made, pressure will at once be experienced to extend it to all war pensioners
-at a gre atlj increased cost.   Assuming however that tha diatincrt-ion when made can be maintained a precedent will have been established for giving exceptional and disproportionate treatment to the totally disabled man as compared with say the 80$&apos;disabled man.   It is assumed that on the 31st March next it will be possible to review the situation and presumably withdraw the bonus if the cost of living has then fallen.   The ctelect Committee (Section 19 of their first report U.C.149) strongly condemned temporary bonuses as unsatisfactory and causing irritation.     It may be doubted fehether once the bonus has been granted it will be possible to withdraw it in the manner suggested,   Should it  -continue until the next general revision at the end of 1922 the Government will, in view of the precedent now proposed to be created, find it difficult to refuse to continue exceptional treat-ment to totally disabled men, even if the general rates of pension are then due to be lowered in accordance with the lower cost of living.     The special needs of the totally disabled man already receive consideration e.g. the grant of a constant attendant allowance where required,J&amp;r: jay JUords 4Q no&amp; undoxsctfjuu the oasis vii witch it is calculated that the increase to the; totally disabled man should be5s. a week.   It is common groundTthat repeated variations in the rate of pensions even if practicable would lead to most wasteful expenditure on administration.   Equally it is wrong to base pens%*n charges on the Cost of living figures in a particular month.   The Eoyal Warrant takes as the standard by which the future cost of living is to be measured, the average cost in 1919. This is 215 points (Pre-war cost M 100).   Por the first 6 months of 1920 the average is 234^. This is an increase of 9 per centor, in terms
terms^of money 3s.6d. a week instead of the 5s. proposed.   The ne\j rates were granted from September 1919,   If, instead of adopting the method of the Royal Warrant, comparison is made between the cost of living in the period of twelve months pre-ceding September 1919 and the average cost of living since, the percentage rise works out at 1% or, in money a little under 3s. Qd. a week.   Under neither method does the increase appear very high and there is no evidence that it will be other than temporary.   It is a reasonable assumption that between now and the 31st March 1923 the cost of living will.so far decrease as to make it clear that the decision of the Cabinet last autumn, .viz. that 1919 rates of pension should continue for 3 years whether the cost of living rose or fell, was a fair and equita-ble arrangement,   in the meantime My Lords strongly deprecate any tampering with that settlement by the grant of a &quot;Temporary&quot; bonus to any class.I am,Sir,. Your obedient servant, (Sgdo)    GoL. BARSTOW.
