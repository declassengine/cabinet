P. 14^3.GOVSaBggftT, OF IR5LAHD 3TIL.     &apos; SUSPMSORY CLAUSE, Report of Committeo a up orated by Cabinet 35 (20) Minute 1.Tho Committee divided their enquiry under two heads:-(a) the question of an oath of allegiance being taken by all candidates--for Parliament before-   being allowed to stand, and whether provision &quot;should not be made for such an oath to be administered by a representative of the Crown.(b) the question of powers being inserted in the...Bill &apos;to suspend its operation in the event of the Parliament&apos; of Southern Ireland either refusing to function or endeavouring to act unconstitution-ally.With regard to (a) the Committee wore informed that a Bill (Sheriffs (Ireland) Bill) was now before the Imperial Parliament , which, if passed, would authorise the Lord Lieutenant to nominate the Sub-Sheriffs who would be the Returning Officers.     TheIs, -Committee felt that if this Bill passed into law it *&apos;7ould be a sufficient guarantee that the oath would be properly administered and leave no loop hole for evasion.The Committee had before them, in this connection a letter from the President of tho Board of Education (&quot;ho was unable to be present) and the points referred to by him received consideratfon*The Committee decided to re commendThat provision should be made in the Bill for an Oath of Allegiance to be taken by candidates for Parliament before they could be allowed to stand as such and that such an oath should be administer^ ed by the Returning Officer.it
j &quot;       &apos; ,0&apos;::...... &quot;   2  r - ..... ,, ,The Comro.ittoo then passed on to tho consideration of tho powers&apos; to &quot;be inserted in the Bill to suspend.its operation in the event&apos; of the Parliament of Southern Ireland either refusing to function or endeavouring to act unconstitutionally.They reviewed the following alternatives, as directed &quot;by the Cabinet, to the Draft Clause (CP. 1438) having Mr. -lonar Law&apos;s.pledge given on the 30th March, 1920&quot; in the House of C ommons, in mind: -?.:&apos;.&apos;:&apos;(i)N   That Southern Ireland should revert as nearly as possible; to the status&apos; quo ,totfining the right to send members to the&apos;Imperial Parliament, and tho administration&apos; remaining as at pre sent:(ii)   That a nominated assembly, perhaps of smaller size but sufficient to form a quorum, should be sub-stituted for the elected assembly, with the same &apos;  powers as are provided in&apos;the Bill,The Committee decided, to reject the first alternative for the following reasons the proposal seemed to the Committee to&apos; be inconsistent with the framework of the Bill and to involve such radical alt era-tions as to make it impracticable.   For instance(l)   No Council of Ireland could bo found and railwaysand fisheries would be left &quot;in the ai^&quot;. (2)   It would be impossible to justify the reduction of the numbers, of members, returned, to the Imperial Parliament by the part of Ireland which remained under the Imperial administration. (3)   Fundamental charges -would have to be effected in the provisions relating to the Imperial Contribution,, the collection and appropriation of pUrchaso ;&quot;  annuities;, the constitution of the Joint Exchequer
Board, and the Civil Service Committoe all of which would affect Northern aa well as Southern Ireland,-  - -     (4) The provisions as to the Judicature framed on .the... analogy of tho judicatures in the federal * dominions could hardly stand,.(J) The arrangement would &quot;be open to the criticism that &quot; .  .        the only part of Ireland for vrhich a separate -. legislature was established was the part which&quot;wished to remain under the Imperial Legislature,After a discussion, during T&apos;hich the&apos; suggestions made by the President of the Board of Education in his letter received consideration, the Committee decided to suggest that the second alternative quoted above bo adopted, i.e. an Assembly nominated by the Crown.-  The Committee examined the clause already submitted to the Cabinet in detail,     ...    ...&quot;Tney came to the conclusion that in the events contemplated in the clause the Parliament should be dissolved as proposed by tho clause and not merely suspended..They made a few minor alterations in the clause and the -clause as&apos; settled, by. the Committee is attached to this Report the changes being shown- by under-lining.2 &quot;hit oh al1 .
