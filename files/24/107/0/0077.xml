Wi u this Document it His Britannic Ma) ;r a Pki   i\\J \ IL. i From Viceroy, Foreign Department, Ylih June 1920.(Received 15th, 9 p.in.)730 S. Following telegram has been received from Dobbs, No. 70 S. of 11th June: &quot; Tarsi has sent written note in reply to note handed to him by me at meeting of 7th June. It is full of stupid and perverse arguments to which Afghan (corrupt group)ics have accustomed us, but was accompanied by all sorts of deprecatory private and secret messages assuring me that display of fireworks is intended for consumption of Kabul, and that attitude of delegation is sincerely friendly and conciliatory. Note starts with repetition of report by General Wakil Khan regarding reoccupation of Lambarbat, attempting to make out that this is breach of undertaking-given in my letter dated 15th ultimo, No. 22, and asking for withdrawal of guards. Note proceeds to deny instigation of our tribes by Afghans, trots out well-worn arguments of right of Afghanistan over frontier tribes, saying without help from us in arms and money Afghanistan is not strong enough to incur displeasure of Russia by preventing her from sending arms and emissaries through Afghanistan to our tribes, and. concluding as follows : &quot;&quot;Afghanistan is ready to assure your Government of its acceptance, in con-tormity with its rights of freedom, of demand mentioned by you, but this we do conditional upon fulfilment of your promise. You wish to help us to become free, strong and prosperous. Real essence of question lies here. If you will favour me with full details in this respect we shall have nearly reached final settlement.&apos;&quot;Receipt of this note will necessitate a good deal more plain speaking, but this will not do any harm. I hear its tone is due to arrival of letter from Nadir Khan, bitterly reproaching Tarsi with being too complacent. Tarsi has been haranguing his entourage,&quot;telling them that if ever he comes to India again on diplomatic mission he will insist on Amir accompanying him, as anyone coming alone and trying to make reasonable agreement is immediately supplanted at Kabul.&quot;
