New demands from the miners are imminent and sections of the rail&apos;railwaymen ere dissatisfied with the recent award.The advocates of Direct Action for political ends have received a set-back during the week from the reilw&amp;railwaymen and transport workers.   On the other hand, the transport workers seem inclined to sympathise with an International labour boycott on &quot;White&quot; Hungary from June 80th.Ill feeling between British ai;d Irish labour seems to be growing.   Sinn Pein speakers have violently attacked the Labour Party and the National Union of Railwaymen.There are rumours of active trouble in Ireland on June 21st. Meanwhile a Railway strike is imminent.There will be determined opposition by Labour to any increase in ronts.If the Herald League may be taken as an incise of revolutionary feeling, public interest in revolution is declining.In its anxiety to &apos;raise the wind&apos; the &quot;Dailv Herald&quot; is considering working m a connection with Germany.
THE &quot;BAUDS OFF RUSSIA&quot; MOVISIiaflTThe agitation against      JPoliah, oa^ensXvo-appears to bo waning slightly.   Meetings continue to be held in Grosvenor Square, twice a week; on June 5th several members of the audience, including R. Hease, took exception to the presence of reporters and seized a note-book.   The audience on this occasion numbered about 250, The most regular speaker oh the subject at London meetings is Mr, Mai one, 11.3?,The removal of .the embargo on Polish munitions by the Scecutive of the National Union of Railwayman has been a severe blow to the extremists who had hoped that the example of the dockers would be followed bj; all trade unionists.   The &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committee has also received a rebuff at the hands of the Transport Workers&apos; Federation, which resents the Committee&apos;s invitation to its members to strike against the Polish offensive.   The Transport Executive &quot;emphatically protests&quot; against the methods adopted by the Committee which are &quot;calculated to undermine the authority&quot; of the Trade Union Officials. The Executive further enquires if the Unions of which members of the &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committee are leaders have instructed their own members in the sense of the manifesto.   This rebuff has brought a hasty disclaimer from W, P. Coates who says:   &quot;If such a document has been received by the Transport Workers1 federation it is a v, forgery,&quot;   The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; understands that the letter !S&amp;s one addressed to .;r. I3evin by Mr, Coates.&quot;Mr-. Turner and Mr, Shaw of the British Labour Delegation, have arrived in England from Russia; they have brought an interim report, which will be published as soon as possible.    Mr. Turner has made it dear, in an interview, that he aoes not wholly  , approve of Bolshevik methods.
tins utmmmThe negotiations-with the railway-men are not yet i smooth water.   There has nardly been time for feeling-on the award of the National Wages Board-ijo-crystallize but there is little doubt that there is extreme,disappointme: in many sections, notably London, Liverpool, Glasgow,. Cardiff and Derby.   It is not improbable that the award will be accepted by a majority of the railwayraen and a fresh demand advanced at an early date: this question wi probably be fully debated at the annual general meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen in Belfast on July 5th. . In any case it is a good sign that Mr, J, R. Thoma M.P., was able to hold his own at a meeting of the zone Elms branch on June 6tht although his defenoe of the recent award was severely criticised by some members of the audience, which numbered 3,000. .The extremists among the railwaymen are also much concerned with, the ruling of their ISxeoutive in regard to Poland and Ireland.   The GUx^ow District Cotinoil has decided by 4j votes to 1 to induce all affiliated branches to demand the resignation of the Executive of the National Union of Railwayman.   A sp-eoial campaign to gain support for this resolution will be conducted -during the week, culminating in a mass meeting on June 13th, -:The order of the National Union of Railwaymen to the Irish railwaymen to handle munitions seems likely to lead to strife inside the Union and has enraged agitators in this country.   Mr. Cramp declared at Buskin College on June 7th that hie Executive was divided on the Irish question and that the line taken was not in accordance with his own inclination or choice Re thought that action taken only by the Railwaymenwould/
would be ineffective; &quot;the matter must be dealt with by the Triple Alliance, backed by the whole Trade Union movement.-If thr?ro U a general strike on the Irish, railways Labour men in this country will be forced to take a decision.THB COAL MINERSThe threatened seoession of the coal miners of South Wales from the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain has not yet been settled.   While the officials favour an inorease in the contribution a large body of the ranX end file oppose it.   Another ballot is to be taken and if the vote goes  gainst tho increase the South Wtdes end Monmouthshire Coalfield automatically becomes dissociated from the Miners1 Federation.At a Conference held at Cardiff on June 5th it was decided that a demand should be made at the National Conference on June 10th for an allowance in wages &quot;commensurate with the ascertained surplus profits of the mining industry ...... in the form of a flat rate for allworkmen&quot;.The Lancashire and Cheshire liters1 Fedoration has instructed its delegates to press for an advance of 40 per cent.In an article which is probably inspired the &quot;Billy Herald&quot; declares that tho Conference will demand -the removal of the recent addition of 14s. Ed. to the price of house coal and that wages be increased to cover the profit realised from tho advt.noo of 4s. 2d. per ton on industrial ooal or, alternatively, that the whole of the profits derived from the increased prices be absorbed in wages.Mr. Prank Hodges claims that, in spite of the recentadvances/
M     4advances, minors&apos; wages are still 21 per cent below the actual level of living in pre-war time.THE COST OP LIVINGThe Conferenoe-^ef.Lal*yur^ So^ organisations, referred to in my last report, was held at Manchester on June 5th under the Presidency of Mr. B. J. Rookway.   A resolution condemning the increase in the cos of necessaries, advocating a lovy on capital and the abolition of indirect taxation on food stuffs, together with the demands familiar on extremist platforms, was passed.   The Co-operative Societies were urged to sell as near cost price as possible and to unite with the Trade Unions and the Labour Party in an educetional camps to &quot;expose the evils of capitalism&quot;.   The Conference also resolved that &quot;no permanent solution of the problem of prices can be found until production, distribution and credit are controlled by organised labour&quot;.There is to be a &quot;Socialist Conference on High Price convened by the City of London branch of the Independent Labour Party on June 12th. This advocates the &quot;supersesi of the capitalist system by the Co-operative Commonweal^ of International Socialism&quot;. The Secretary says that nearly 200 Labour, Co-operative and Ex-Servicemen&apos;s organisations are to send delegates.THB HOUSING question the opposition to the proposed increase in rents is spreading. In Glasgow a &quot;No rent&quot; strike is contemplate and resolutions are bein&apos;  passed in various parts of the oountry, recommending a boycott of the measure.LABOUR/
Besides the propaganda -againeir recruiting&apos; on the part of extremist societies, Labour Councillors, especially in Yorkshire, aro beginning to oome out against recruiting schemes.   At Wakefield, when tho question of paying Corporation employees when absent for training oaiae  u;t Councillor Sherwood drew a picture     * of a young Territorial being conscripted to take his father1 s .job.   &quot;Are the Territorials&quot;, he asked, &quot;to be used in an Industrial fight to crush their own flesh and blood?&apos;fTHE 4MRITSAR INCIDENTPublication of the majority report of Lord Hunter^ Committee has created a commotion among the Indian and Irish extremists, who held a meeting on June 3rd in the Eingsway Hall, whioh was addressed, among others, by Major Barnes. M.P., Mr. 0. Rornlmanf Mr, Hell Maclean, H.P.t and Mr. George Lansbury.   The two last named ?;ere severely heckled by members of the audience and at times the meeting was in uproar, but the resolution demanding the impeachment of Lord Chelmsford and Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer was carried with six dissenting votes.On June 6th a similar meeting was held at Birmingham, hut only 250 people attended.   The speeches were more violent than in London.There are indications that Indians in London are getting into touch with Libour leaders and Trade Councillors with a view to introducing their methods among Indian labour.THE RER&amp;LD league     I &quot;&quot;I &apos; 1 &quot;.....&quot; &apos;t    &apos;   11.1*1111.111 *Speakers at the week-end meetings have latelyencountered some opposition, probably because the steadyelement/-XABOUR OPPOSITION TO MILITARY SERVICE
 ^jeiaeirt^-^^ -air.speeches when he would not trouble to attend indoor meetings.   The attendance, however, has fallen off.   On June.7th only seven people attended a meeting of tho Camperwe11.Branch and it was stated that the membership had declined from 100,to 40 and that the iunds were reduced to a few shillings.THB INTERNATIONAL UNION Off SZ-SERVIOE MBMTho members of this organisation are avowed revolutionaries, and they have little importance except among the worst elements in Glasgow and With a small following in Bristol.  At a recent Glasgow meeting, however, their speakers made a scurrilous attack upon the Government and practically advocated murder of the capitalist classes.   Copies of the speeches have been submitted to the Lord Advocate for consideration.gSORGE NICHOLSON -Nicholson has been fairly quiet for some time but he appeared last week at the International Socialist Club.   He said that he was now employed by the League of . Nations Union and promised to have Claude McKay, the negro extremist, put on the UnionTs list of speakers. Nicholson added that he had offered Mr. Lansbury a copy of an Air force circular relating to railway strikes and asked him to publish it.   Lsnsbury was, however, afraid of the consequences and refused to  do so unless Nicholson gave him a printed copy.JOHN IjoLjANJohn McLean&apos;s lack of mental balance appears to beprogressive/
M     ^    a*v-progressive.   Hir late-s-k fjpo^cJ^ .axKruslng tkc Government of having com&amp;iilrted the murders which are attributed to the Sinn PeinerB, has been submitted to the Lord Advocate for considera-tion.THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;&apos;Ever anxious to increase its revenue, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is now considering a scheme for circulation in Germany.   Tho business manager cf the Manchester Office is of opinion that &quot;as the Herald is the only Labour and Socialist paper published daily, is international in its outlook and is therefore more friendly towards Germany than any other paper ....... a very great postal circulation could be workedup in Germany.&quot;  He suggests that specimen copies should be distributed, together with a circular letter advertising a Gorman agency and adds;-   T&apos;Tfcere is another question ; that of advertising.   There should be large amounts of money which the German liamfacturer iB prepared to spend in advertising his goods, and as no other BeUish Newspaper is accepting any German advertisements, there is, I believe, an enormous revenue to be collected from approved Gorman Advertisements for the &apos;Ltiil^ Herald&apos; \SINN P5IN IN GREAT BRITAINThe Irish element in London has been comparatively quiet during the week although a certain number of meetings and several dances have been held.   Tie most important : meeting was held in Parliament Hill Pields under the auspices of the Irish Self-Deo agination League on June 6th; about 1,000 people were present and the speakers included Cathal 0TShannon and Sean lucGraith.   The former stated that he had just come over from Ireland and reprimanded E^lish labour for not supporting the Sinn Peiners.   HoGraithstrongly/
strongly attacked-the-actions of the military and police in Ireland,The annoyance of the average Englishman with Irish extremists was in evidence at the Ililitary Tournament, where the Leinster Re&amp;imont, usually very popular, evoked neither applause nor sympathy-It is reported that a convention of representatives of Iribh Self-Determination League branches will be held at Manchester in September, when arrangements will be made for a further campaign.An enthusiastic meeting of some 800 people was held at Liverpool on J..ne 6th with the object of enrolling all the Irith of Liverpool in the Irish Self-Deterraination League and forming new branches, Mr. James Moran, Mr. Sonv Miiroy, M.P., Hr, Jr^es Whelan and I*r. SeAc-us CK&amp;lly were the speakers and in each case made a violent attack upon the Labour Prrty and Mr. J. E. Thoiaas, M.P. Mr. Hilroy emphasising the secrecy of Sinn Fein plans said:-&quot;$very Irishman and woman must be organised so that when the time comes we can act unitedly,   tfou must trust your leaders but we are not going to say what we shall do.   We will put a cordon, round Great Britain and when the time comes, when we receive the call from the Cc;itel of tho Irish Bet*rt*Iic to act, we will act and every man and woman must be prepared to do his or her share even if it means making the supreme sacrifice for the cause of Sinn Fein.&apos;mr. Milroy was slightly more commimicative when he spokeat a Manchester meeting of about 350 people on Juno 5th.&quot;Tho Government is trying very hard to urge us on to insurrection, but they cannot do so.   The time is not yet here and we will wait our time.   If England wants peace they must send over plenipotentiaries to discuss peace terms, and thereafter leave. Ireland to its own resources.   Only by this moans can we remain, friends with iSngland.   The altarnetive to this is to strike and strike herd when the time comes,   I cannot tell you what form the fight may take, as it may be oy negotiations with other countries, or by the shedding of Irish blood, but I hope when the time does come we shall ell be ready.   Remember when the time comes for striking that the whole civilised world is looking on, and that we have America, Canada, Australia and other foreign Powers at our backs and possibly South Africa.&quot;
- 9 -My correspondent reports that Sinn tfein meetings in Liverpool and Manchester are now advertised chiefly by means of handbills which are distributed at the Roman Catholic , ,Churches and not ty posters.It is rumoured in t*io Manchester district that a large demonstration will be held on Jr.ne 21st. &quot;when trouble is expected in Ireland.&quot;On I*ay 30th.tho Bradford branches of the United Irish ; League resolved to amalgamate with tue Irish Self-Determination League.. , My Glasgow correspondent reports that the progress ofSinn Fein in his district is &quot;abnormal&quot; end that all the Irish with the exception of the Ulstermen are supporters of the &quot;Irish Republic&quot;.IRELANDThe situation in Ireland remains unchanged and intimidationis rampant.   163 indictable offences had been specially reported during the 6 days preceding June 4th.   Of tnese outrages 113were directly attributable to Sinn rein, 32 were agrarian, andother serious crimes affecting the oeaee of the country nrmbered18.   Bight attaoks were made on Police Barracks; gelignite. &apos; and&apos;bombs/ petrol, being used :,y the raiders who wore in all cafes driven off: many of them are. said to have Veen wounded.The attack on  illmallock  arracks is by far the biggest planned by the rebels since the Rebellion.   Reliable information shows that altogether 2,000 men took part in it.   500 were employed in actually attacking the  tracks and the remainder were used for blocking roads and scouting for a radius of 20 miles.   Machine or Lewis guns were used.   One is reported to have been placed in position on the Provincial Bank and another at Rolycross where the roid was blocked.A significant niece of information has boon received which states/
&apos; V,    vi / \     H- 10 -Istates that the-o^ehals-^Kmiiexrted with the illegal purchase   * of armsvam^TDUBitions have decreased the prices they offer, as they state that such arms are comparatively easy to obtain without payment.   The well planned capture of rifles, ammunition and equipment from the Military guard at Kings Inns, Henrietta Street, on June 1st, is looked upon as1another Sinn Fein victory.On June 1st Drumsna Courthouse in Co. Leitrim was raided and all official books and documents were taken outside and burned.   A &quot;proclamation&quot; was found near the building stating that anyone upholding British law would meet with the same fate as the police.On May 29th, 12 head of cattle were driven off a farm at Rathmpre.   This is a continuation of a series of outrages to compel the owners to surrender land.   In Co. Salway notices were posted up warning herdsmen and others that unless they left their employment in cases where the land was demanded they would he shot.The refusal of dockers and railwaymen to handle munition&apos; for troops in Ireland continues, although it is reported that many of the men are grumbling.   The strike of London and Horth Western Railway workers following their refusal to handle military stores still drags on.A number of Sinn Fein courts are being held and several &quot;arrests&quot; have been made by hands of Irish Volunteers. Particulars as to these oroooedings are being inserted in the Press by the Sinn Fein party with a view to showing how it has assumed control of the country. ,i 1
