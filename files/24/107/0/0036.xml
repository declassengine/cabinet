This document is the property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.ILUIILITHE CABINET. AI venture to hope that the Cabinet will give an early decision on the questions raised by me about the future methods of control in Mesopotamia? The troops have /3^10 now been living for many months in tents, which is not only very costly in wear and tear but most severe upon the, troops and productive both of sickness and discontent. Either hutments or permanent barracks must be provided at an early date. It seems a great pity to spend several millions of pounds on building squalid hutments which in a few years will have to be replaced by permanent buildings, when forethought and decision now would enable the permanent buildings to be erected where absolutely necessary in the first instance. On the other hand, uncertainty as to the extent of the country to be occupied immediately, as to the strength of the garrison needed to hold such territory, as to the character of that garrison and as to the method of control, makes it impossible to decide where these permanent buildings should be made and what their size and character should be.The same considerations arise in the case of Palestine, where the troops ought not to be asked to face a third winter under rigorous climatic conditions in tents.The military expense of garrisoning Palestine and Mesopotamia will exceed 28 million pounds in the present year, or nearly the yield of sevenpence on the Income Tax.Secondly, I would ask that a decision be given about Persia. The military expenditure on Persia is now proceeding at a rate of 570,0007. per month. It is for the Cabinet to define the nature of our military obligations towards Persia, in order that the necessary measures can be taken&quot; either to defend Persia or to evacuate Persia. At the present time we seem to have the advantages of neither policy with the inconveniences of both.w. s. c.War Office,7th June, 1920.121FUTURE METHODS OP CONTROL IN&quot; MESOPOTAMIA.       ^1859(1320/274)   100  6/20  H&amp;S  8297wo
