PGR NEW EXPENDITURE. :-&apos; -Memorandum by the Minister- of^Labour ^ ,   .I desire to refer to that portion of the memorandum C,P, 1413, by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which states that I am &quot;revising proposals which were not pre seed by Sir Robert Home for the training of fit ex-service men and the continued training of women which are roughly estimated to cost  0,000,000 and  400,000 respectively.&quot;(1)    So far as the training of fit ex-service men is concerned, industrial training for able-bodied men, as I pointed out In my memorandum CP. 1315,, was an integral portion of the programme put forward by the Prime Minister and mr Bonar Law in connection with the last General Election,I am now asking not for a departure in principle but for a decision as to how far we shall implement a pledge already given a(2)    With regard to the proposal for the continued training of women, it does not give a correct impression to say that I am reviving proposals Milch were not pressed by Sir Robert Home and which are estimated to cost  400,000,   The question of the continuance of women5 s training beyond. June 30th was, I am Informed, carefully considered on Its merits by Sir Robert Home, who decided, and had in fact arranged, to put forward the proposal to the Treasury *   Sir Robert Home left the
Ministry of Labour before he could actually put forward the proposal, but after independent examination 1 found myself in complete accord with his conclusions&apos;; &quot;&apos;this   proposal does not involve an estimated new expenditure of  400,000,    An expenditure of  250,000 had already been sanctioned for the period to June 50th, and of this, some  40,000 will remain unexpended.The proposal which I now put forward to extend women&quot;1 s training for a further six months involves an estimated expenditure of  200;, 000 only, making a total for the year of  410,000, or  160,000   more than the amount already sanctioned.(Signed)     T.J.KACMAMARA.Ministry of Labour, 13. * 6 * 2 0 *
