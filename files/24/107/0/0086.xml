Mussoorie conference. Following telegram from Dobbs, No; 72 S., dated 14th June, repeated for information :--&quot; Discussion on Turkish peace terms was concluded to-day.   Attitude of Afghan delegates was extraordinarily reasonable and subdued.  Afghans first asked whether there was any prospect that Turkish terms could be modified in any way out of regard, for Afghan feelings.  I replied in negative and gave resume&apos; of principles on which -Turkey had been dealt with.  Afghans then asked whether we would facilitate journey of Afghan delegation to Paris to represent their view there.   I replied; in tlie first&apos;&apos; place, that Afghanistan, not being one of belligerent nations, has no locus slaiidi for making of such representations; and, in second place, delegation would be useless as &apos; terms are already finally settled with exception of such very ininor alterations as Turkish representatives may be able to induce Allied Powers to make at last &quot;moment. Principal Afghan suggestion was;that nominal suzerainty oE Turkey might, be retained over Arab and other nationalities, which are to be made independent under present terms.   This, they . said, would largely satisfy sentiments of Afghans and other Moslems.&quot;
