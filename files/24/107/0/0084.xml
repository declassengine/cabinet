Sir,, ,  ,With reference to your letter to the j&apos;irst lord, dated the 4th June enclosing a paper issued by Monsieur lii lie rand on the subject of the execution of the treaty of Peace with Germany (CoP.1381),- I-am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the xidmiralty to- state that they concur in the list, with the exception of page: 37, paragraph 4 (laval Clauses).1    The question of violation of Article 19E,in so far as it.refers to material destroyed between July 9th and January 10th, appears to be affected by the legal view taken by foreign Office advisers on the reading of Article 169 (foreign Office telegram 636 of&apos;the 3rd June, 1920, and 669 of the 10th June, 19- 0.-This view states that Germany cannot be taken to account for destruction of war material referred to in Article 169 between July 9th and January 10th.   this legal opinion presumably covers the war material referred to in Article 192.I am, oir,Your&apos; obedient servant,(Sd. ) ALLI jplim.The Secretary, CABIMT.

SECRET.THE CABINET.EXECUTION OP THE TREATY OF PEACE WITH GERMANY.-    MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.&apos; &apos; I circulate herewith the observations of the. General Staff on the memoranda of M, Millerand concerning Germany&apos;s violation of the Treaty of Peace.   (b.r. 1381.)V;. &apos; * Wf S. C. &apos;-War Office, [7th June, 1920.1. The General Staff are in general agreement ,with, the memoranda transmitted by M. Millerand concerning Germany&apos;s violations of the military terms of the Peace Treaty, and submit the following remarks thereon ; 2. Article 211 (page 1 of General Weygand&apos;s covering fetter).   Alteration of1 -     .   &apos;-German laws.- .On 1st June, 1920, the German Government issued to the Press a. semi-official statement to the effect that compulsory service was automatically abolished by the ratification of the Peace Treaty by the National Assembly. &apos; -     -In the opinion of the General Staff, this does not appear to be- sufficient, and it is considered that a law should be promulgated definitely abolishing compulsory military service in Germany.- Similarly, laws should be passed to abolish the organization of reserves and to establish the Reichswehr as the only armed force in Germany, in accordance with the military terms of the Peace Treaty. - &quot;It is understood that a new draft law, for the abolition of compulsory military service, has recently been laid before the Reichsrat. :&apos;3..(a.)&apos; Article 162. &apos; Police effectives.-       .. . ;&apos;. *This is a fair indictment. In view of the decision of the Supreme Council (Note of ,12th December, 1919), the Sicherheitspolizei should be abolished at once; the German Government has taken no steps whatever to comply with this decision.An early reply should, as suggested by General Weygand, be given to the German Governments-request of 20th April informing them that sanction cannot be granted for the maintenance of an army larger than 100,000 men, and demanding its immediate reduction to this figure. \It is for consideration whether we should, at the same time, inform the Germans that we intend to agree to an increase in the numbers of their police, provided this is a genuine police force, without any military character of any kind.3. (b.) Glauses which are being executed (page 2 of General Weygand&apos;s covering letter).-V; This is a reasonable proposal, with the sole exception of the increase in the numbers of the police; Surely the reduction of the Reichswehr from 200,000 to 100,000, and the abolition of the Sicherhekspolizei (60,000 men), should be carried out simultaneously with an increase of the police. -(B20/288) &quot;lOO  6/20  H&amp;S  8323woThis document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.
4. Article 180 (page 3 of Memorandum). General Bingham&apos;s latest report (2nd June, 1920), shows that, although the disarmament of the fortifications has been carried out, the dismantling will not be completed until the, end of September, i.e., nearly three months after the time fixed by the Peace Treaty (10th July). &apos;,,5. Article 169 (pages 4-6).  &apos;vThe figures agree generally with those given by General Bingham. There is no doubt that the German military authorities are doing their utmost to prevent the execution of this article by the concealment of material, the action of liaison officers, and by making use of various pretexts and supposed loopholes in the Peace Treaty.A large quantity of German guns and war material has been reported as destroyed by the Germans &quot; without control,&quot; but checked. We should ascertain how the Commission of Control have verified this destruction, and especially whether they are absolutely certain that guns destroyed were really modern German material, and not obsolete guns or material captured from the Allies, e.g., British, French or Russian guns. It seems of the utmost importance to prevent any destruction &quot; without control,&quot; as of course the Prussian military authorities are certain to make every possible use of such an opportunity.The General Staff have always emphasized the paramount importance of a thoroughly complete execution of the terms of Article 169, regarding which there must be no yielding whatever. It is absolutely essential for the Commission of Control to continue their work until full compliance has been obtained.6. Article 168 (pages 6-7).-. This is in agreement with General Bingham&apos;s reports.7. Articles 160 and 163 (pages 8-10).-^We are in general agreement with the French statement.General Nollet reported on, 15th April that the Demobilization Staffs were incapable of undertaking any measures of mobilization. If, however, these offices are no longer required, they should be abolished at once.  -The abolition of all irregular formations is another point on which the General Staff have always insisted. It is of the greatest importance to disband the various free corps, Zeitfreiwillige and Einwohnerwehren with the least possible delay, and this should be impressed on the German Government.The question of the Sicherheitsjoolizei has already been dealt with in paragraph 3 above.8. Article 176 (pages 10 and 11).-Our reports agree with this statement. We should insist on the complete execution of this Article.9. Articles 199 and 202 (page 11).-Our reports agree that the execution of these air clauses seem to be going on fairly-satisfactorily.   .10. Article 208 (pages 11-43).-This statement is correct. As stated in paragraph 5, the German military authorities are doing their utmost to impede the work of our Commission of Control, and the German Goverment have failed to carry out their obligations. We must insist on rigid execution of this clause of the Treaty, and should punish severely any violations of it, as also any such outrages as are reported in the French memorandum.11. Article 167 (page 14).-General Bingham characterizes this Article as the most serious difficulty that we have to face in the execution of the Treaty. The Germans argue that, by the. word &quot; armament!&apos; of the forts and strong places, they are justified in keeping mobile defence artillery for all of them. They consequently asked (in January, 1920) to be allowed to retain 5,246 pieces of artillery in these fortified works.This request is, of course, preposterous, and was refused by the Commission of Control.   Correspondence still continues and as the matter stands at present the number
General Staff,War Office,10th June, 1920.of fortified places for which artillery may be allowed has been reduced to five, and the latest German claim is for 836 guns (of which no less than 596 are heavy guns and howitzers). This number is still far too high, and a considerable reduction will no doubt be demanded by the Commission of Control..This is one of the methods by which the Prussian military party are endeavouring to evade the terms of the Treaty, other methods being concealment of material,&apos; delay and obstruction, falsification of documents, &amp;c. Although the wording of the Article is perhaps not as clear and emphatic as it should have been, we must not yield to German arguments, but must insist on the execution of the clause in accordance with its spirit and our reading thereof.12. Article 170 (page 15).-There is no doubt that a large quantity of material, mainly stolen, has been sold to foreign countries. General Bingham is of opinion that the German Government are doing their best to stop this export of war material, and states that they are now employing more stringent methods at the ports to put an end to this illicit export. It is, however, undoubtedly true that a law should have been passed to prohibit the import and export of arms and war material.13. Articles 160, 162, 163 (page 15).-These questions have already been dealt with, vide paragraphs 3 and 7 above.14. Article 211 (page 15).-This statement is correct, vide paragraph 2 above.15. In general, the French indictment is quite fair, and does not give an exaggerated picture of the situation. The Germany military authorities are undoubtedly doing their utmost to prevent the execution of the military terms of the Treaty; the German Government, or at any rate the responsible heads, seem to have been trying to comply, but are too much in the hands of the Prussian military party. *The whole action of the Germans, i.e., the Kapp &quot; Putsch,&quot; the claims re fortress armament, the behaviour of the liaison officers, failure to repeal the law of compulsory service, delay in abolishing the Zeitfreiwillige, JSinwohnerwehren, &amp;c... shows that the German Government, however willing it may have been to carry out the terms of the Peace Treaty, has been too weak and too much in the hands of the Prussian junker and military party, and quite unable to assert itself.Now that the elections have increased the power of the military party and weakened the strength of the Government, it is of the utmost importance to insist on the complete execution of the military terms of the Treaty, with the sole exception of an increase in the number of police.
