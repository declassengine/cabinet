This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,SECRET.iTHE CABINET.The Situation in Mesopotamia should it be decided to evacuate North-West Persia and withdraw on all Fronts, within the area covered by existing Railheads.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate to my colleagues the following memorandum by the General Staff on the situation in Mesopotamia if North-West Persians evacuated and our troops withdrawn to the area covered by existing railheads.W. S. C.The War Office,12th June. 1920.I.The following calculations are based on the assumption that the. forces in Mesopotamia are not required to meet organized aggression from without: 1. Railheads. There are three fronts to be considered, viz.: (a.) Persian, with railhead at Qaritu.(6.) Northern, with railhead at Kifri and Shergat.(c.) Euphrates, with railhead at falujah.2. Advanced troops. Weliave at present in advance of railheads (a.) Persia 2 squadrons cavalry.2 brigades infantry.1 battalion pioneers.1 mountain battery.1 battery Royal Horse Artillery.Ancillary troops.1 light armoured motor battery.These were maintained by a fleet of about 200 lorries and 700 Ford vans, but probably these numbers have since been increased.(b.) Northern Front-2 regiments cavalry.2 brigades infantry.2 mountain batteries.1 battery Royal Field Artillery.Ancillary troops.1 light armoured motor battery.These are maintained by a fleet of about 700 Ford vans.(c.) Euphrates Front ljj regiments cavalry.1 battery Royal Field Artillery.2 battalions infantry.Ancillary troops.1 light armoured motor battery.These are maintained by the 17th Divisional Train.(20/253)  100  6/20  h&amp;S  8253wo
id.) Total in advance of railheads 1 cavalry brigade and 1 regiment.4 infantry brigades , 2 battalions and 1 pioneer battalion. 1 battery Royal Horse Artillery. 2 batteries Royal Field Artillery. 3 mountain batteries.Ancillary troops.    , J3 light armoured motor batteries.And some 200 lorries and 1,400 Ford vans.3. Advanced troops required. On withdrawal of the above it is fair to assume that we should have to retain at or near railheads : At Qaritu and Kifri 2 squadrons cavalry.If- brigades infantry.1 pioneer battalion.2 mountain batteries.1 light armoured motor battery.At Shergat 1 regiment cavalry.1 brigade infantry.1. battery Royal Field Artillery.1 light armoured motor battery.At falujah-1 regiment cavalry.1 battery Royal Field Artillery.2 battalions infantry.1 light armoured motor battery.Total-      m .2j regiments cavalry.3 brigades infantry and 1 pioneer battalion.2 batteries Royal Field Artillery.2 mountain batteries.3 light armoured motor batteries.4. Reductions in troops. Our possible reduction in troops would, therefore, be, deducting total, paragraph 3, from paragraph 2-(d).: If- regiments cavalry.If- brigades infantry.1 battery Royal Horse Artillery.1 mountain battery and ancillary troops, motor transport, &amp;c, as in 2 (d).And, in addition, the infantry brigade at Baiji could be dispensed with when an infantry brigade was stationed at Shergat.5. Remaining garrison. The total garrison of Mesopotamia and North-West Persia, at and beyond Baghdad, is at present: 7 regiments cavalry.32 battalions infantry and 3 pioneer battalions.1 battery Royal Horse Artillery.2 brigades Royal Field Artillery.2 brigades mountain artillery and 1 mountain battery.1 heavy battery.5 light armoured motor batteries. And, if the reduction shown in paragraph 4 should be effected, we should have remaining of- regiments cavalry.5f- brigades infantry and 3 pioneer battalions. 2 brigades Royal Field Artillery. 2 brigades mountain artillery. 1 heavy battery.5 light armoured motor batteries.
6. General reserve. By deducting from this total garrison the &quot; railhead garrisons,&quot; shown in paragraph (3), we shall have remaining as our &quot; general reserve &quot; the following: 3 regiments cavalry.1\ brigades infantry and 2 pioneer battalions. \\ brigades Royal Field Artillery. -\\ brigades mountain artillery. 1 heavy battery.2 light armoured motor batteries.From this general reserve we might spare 1 regiment of cavalry and possibly some Field Artillery; but, having regard to the wide dispersal of the three fronts, the nature of the country, and the fact that we may have trouble on all sides simultaneously, while also dealing with local disturbances at Baghdad, it does not appear safe to rely on any other reductions. Apart from reinforcing the three fronts mentioned this reserve may be drawn upon to maintain order in Lower Mesopotamia, which must prove a source of anxiety until disarmament has been completed.7. Summary of reductions. By withdrawing to our railheads we could reduce the force by: 21- regiments cavalry.2^ brigades infantry.1 battery Royal Horse Artillery.1 mountain battery.Ancillary troops, including some 200 lorries and 1,400 vans.8. Our suggested dispositions would then be :  Persian front 2 squadrons cavalry.1-g- brigades infantry and 1 pioneer battalion.2 mountain batteries.1 light armoured motor battery.. Northern front 1 regiment cavalry.1 brigade infantry.1 battery Royal Field Artillery.1 light armoured motor battery.Euphrates front 1 regiment cavalry.2 battalions infantry.1 battery Royal Field Artillery.1 light armoured motor battery.General reserve 2 regiments cavalry.2^ brigades infantry and \ pioneer battalions. \\ brigades Royal Field Artillery. \\ brigades mountain artillery. 1 heavy battery.2 light armoured motor batteries.II.9. Possible results of withdrawal. From a purely military point of view the situation would not be much affected strategically. We should be in approximately the same position as at present, i.e., we should have.a central striking force with outposts at the head of the main communications in the occupied territory. (It must be noted that the main roads leading out of that territory practically follow the same line as the railways.) A glance at the map, however, shows one very important point, i.e., that if the Euphrates Force be withdrawn to falujah, the Northern Force will be(8253) a 2

By deducting from this total garrison the &quot; railhead garrisons,&quot; shown in paragraph (3), we shall have remaining as our &quot; general reserve &quot; the following: 3 regiments cavalry.2f- brigades infantry and 2 pioneer battalions.

From a purely military point of view the situation would not be much affected strategically. We should be in approximately the same position as at present, i.e., we should have.a central striking force with outposts at the head of the main communications in the occupied territory. (It must be noted that the main roads leading out of that territory practically follow the same line as the railways.) A glance at the map, however, shows one very important point, i.e., that if the Euphrates Force be withdrawn to falujah, the Northern Force will be(8253) a 2
exposed to attack from its left and rear, and its communications with Baghdad will be in a precarious condition in the event of attack from the west. It -therefore appears that the Euphrates Force cannot safely be withdrawn east of (about) Ana.10. The abandonment of Mosul and of the more turbulent districts of Southern Kurdistan could not fail to lower our prestige in the whole of the Middle East, especially just at this time, when holshevik successes, Turkish Nationalist aspirations, the formation of the Arab State, and the doubts as to the future of Kurdistan, are producing a considerable amount of unrest&apos; throughout Mesopotamia and the adjacent territories; and the advancement of railhead to that town is an obvious alternative.11. Without considering the question of aggression from outside, i.e., hostile action by Bolsheviks or Turks, there are three possible sources of trouble in the event of our withdrawal: (a.) Refugees. We have at present some 40,000 Assyrian refugees under our care at Baqubah. These are a constant source of trouble to us, and form. a heavy charge against our expenditure, and a scheme is now on foot for repatriating them. They are very much afraid of getting out of reach of our protection. The danger which they fear, from. Turks and from certain sections of the Kurds, would be much enhanced by the shortening of our protecting arm ; and, in the very probable event of molestation, it is practically certain that not only they, but also a horde of Armenians and others, would make their way within our borders, trusting to our assistance, which, as champions of oppressed peoples, we could hardly refuse. Thus economy in present expenditure will very probably lead to increased charges in the future.(6.) Arabs. The Mesopotamian Arab is always a potential danger. Inter-tribal dissensions have hitherto been the chief safeguard against a rising, but increased knowledge of affairs, and improved facilities for intercommunication, are slowly tending to promote unity where formerly there was division.The two fronts which are opposed to Arab aggression are the Euphrates and Northern Fronts.There is to-day trouble on the Upper Euphrates in the Deir-es-Zor district, and only the presence of our small force there is preventing a serious outbreak. Behind that force, between Ana and Hilla, lies the powerful, and unfriendly, Dulaim tribe, which can muster some 6,000 to 7,000 rifles. This tribe, moreover, is friendly with Maulud and Ramadan Shalash, who have a force of some 6,000 rifles in the desert south-west of the Euphrates.Any withdrawal on our part would inevitably be treated as a sign of weakness, and might weigh down the scale on the side of open hostility, which would no doubt be shared by the Shammar Zarba, who live between the Tigris and Euphrates north of Baghdad, and who are already to some extent under the influence of Turkist Nationalist propaganda.The Northern Front is chiefly exposed as regards Arabs to the attack aud depredations of the Shammar Zarba, but, should we withdraw from Mosul, it will also have to reckon with the large and very mixed population of that town. In pre-war days, Mosul was always considered to be a hotbed of intrigue, and its population was even more polyglot than that of Baghdad Persian, Arab, Turk, Kurd and every variety of Christian were then, and would no doubt be again, a forcing house for every form of political trouble. . ,(c.) Kurds. The main danger, setting aside the Turkish and Bolshevik menace, to both the Northern and Persian fronts lies with the Kurds. To the north and north-east of the line Mosul Kirkuk Qaritu lies the territory of a great number of Kurdish tribes, who amount to a total of some 35,000 rifles. It is not suggested that the whole of these would be likely to join against us, owing to their own tribal discords, but many of the Kurdish chiefs are, even now, only kept quiet with difficulty, and a withdrawal of our influence, which would leave the ground open for the reception of all sorts of anti-British propaganda, would inevitably result in open hostility. Especially is this the case in the districts of Mosul itself, Erbil, Kirkuk and Altun Keupri.12. Summary of conclusions. The Euphrates Force cannot safely be withdrawn below (say) Ana, so long as the Northern Front is at or near Shergat.13. By withdrawal we shall increase our potential dangers in two respects, viz. : (a.) Economic, due to probable influx of refugees.(b.) Military, due to tne combined effect of the removal of our own influence and of the spread of hostile propaganda, on our potential enemies, which may neutralize any saving which now appears possible.
Note. -A map to illustrate the present situation is being circulated separately.14. We have concluded that, by withdrawal to railheads, we could reduce the mechanical transport of the force by some 200 lorries and 1,400 Ford vans.15. It may be taken that the following movable columns might be formed from &quot;the railhead garrisons shown in Part I., paragraph 3  Persian Front 2 squadrons cavalry. 1 brigade.2 mountain batteries (less 2 sections), 1 light armoured motor battery.Northern Front 1 regiment cavalry.1 brigade (less 1 battalion).2 field batteries.1 light armoured motor battery.   -Euphrates Front 1 regiment cavalry. &quot;1    This column would presumably2 battalions. I be maintained as at present, partly1 held battery. (by river and partly by divisional1 light armoured motor battery. J transport.16. The greatest distances which we need consider (as regards movements of railhead garrisons only) are, probably 1        Persian Front Qaritu to Kermanshah ...      ...      ...      ...   100 miles.Kifri to Suleimaniyeh ...      .:.      ...      ...   130 miles.Northern Front Baiji to Suliemaniyeh ...      ...      ...      ...   120 miles.17. To maintain &quot;a force of 1 British battalion,      * 2 Indian battalions, 1 regiment Indian cavalry, 2 mountain batteries,requires daily 120 Ford vans, or , -18-3-ton lorries.This is based on food for men and animals only. For ammunition, stores, &amp;c, an allowance must therefore be made : (say) 10 Ford vans or 2 lorries.   Total daily-130 Ford vans, or -   20 lorries.For a force of this size, operating 125 miles from railhead, six such daily echelons would be needed.Therefore, our requirements may be taken as being (allowing 6f- vans as being equal to 1 lorry) (a.) Persian Front 455 vans and 50 lorries. (b.) Northern Front 455 vans and 50 lorries.Total, (say) 900 vans and 100 lorries,18. Comparing this total with the statement given in (1), we find that our nett reduction, due to withdrawal, would be approximately 500 Ford vans and 100 lorries.
; ^ 7 iTHE CABINET.The Situation in Mesopotamia should it be decided to Evacuate North-West Persia and withdraw on all Fronts within the area covered by existing Railheads.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate the observations of the Chief of the Air Staff on the Memorandum by the General Staff.w. s. c.The War Office,12th June., 1920.Secretary of State.I have carefully considered the attached General Staff Memorandum, but the fact that it is based on an entirely different conception from the view put forward in the Royal Air Force scheme prevents me from expressing any opinion on the size of the garrisons proposed for each place.2. The General Staff scheme makes provision for garrisons at railhead strong enough to permit of large mobile columns operating 125 miles away, whereas in our scheme it is not proposed to undertake punitive expeditions other than with light armoured car batteries and aircraft.3. It is noted that no provision appears to be made for the maintenance of order by local levies ; this was an integral part of the Royal Air Force scheme. ,4. Although no mention of Royal Air Force units is. made in the General Staff Memorandum, I assume that the garrison of the country will include the three squadrons of modern machines for which provision has already been made.5. I always understood that it was important to maintain a garrison at Mosul and that the ultimate intention was to continue the railway to that place ; in the scheme referred to it appears that troops are not to be stationed further north than Shergat.&apos;6. In the War Office scheme provision is apparently made to garrison Southern Kurdistan with a large number of troops, whereas in our scheme it was not intended that we should do more at the outset than administer the fringes of that country, neither was the possibility of a Bolshevik advance through Persia many hundreds of miles from their base thought to be sufficiently menacing to demand measures to be taken against it.7. A great point that stands out to me in all this discussion on Mesopotamia is that a large part of the force is not required for the protection of Mesopotamia, but in order to garrison and safeguard Persia, and therefore I think it should be plainly put down that a proportion of this force is meant for the internal protection of Persia, and it should be called the Persian Force, and should be in addition to the Mesopotamian Force, and distinct from it, though working, of course, in co-operation with it.8. To sum up, it appears to me that we must either make up our minds to reduce the garrison to the force I have outlined in the air scheme and take the risk that it entails, or clear out of the country altogether, or pay to continue to hold the country by force of arms by means of a large garrison as outlined in the attached scheme, which will probably not be any more successful in maintaining peace and quietness and preventing alarms than the much larger garrison there at present.I am confident that the air scheme would be a success if both the civil and the Service side work as suggested. If it failed it would be impossible to reverse the policy without having to reconquer the whole country with the aid of a large army, but I do not anticipate failure. If the Air Force scheme of control is to be adopted it must be remembered that it was not drawn up with a view to fighting a Bolshevist army in the neighbourhood of Kasvin and Enzeli in Northern Persia. It must also be realized that no serious withdrawal can take place beyond what is justified by the state of the country until we are in sufficient strength in the air to carry out our proposals. In this connection I must once more remark that we shall have to enlist and train the men before we shall be ready, and further that any delay in starting this work means -additional delay in providing the Air Force necessary for the air scheme.H. Trenchard,Chief of the Air Staff..
