(Translation),OOviS&amp;ttini JOL&amp; ISSIOH OF ifHS .SAAil-oTEKRITORy&apos;,&apos;^Office of the President Saarbruek.1st Hay, 1920.ti ITo sum up, April.was for tho Governing Commission, and tfspeoiallr for its President, a month of work in the course of which important questions of a legislative, administrative and financial character had to be examined and settled.Tho Commission.was not spared difficulties of a political and economic order, but it taicos pleasure in recording that, despite an agitation fostered from abroad, the&apos; public peace was not for a ,moment disturbed, nor work interrupted.     No strikes have taken plac* during April throughout the Territory.This re, alt is the more t* teworthy, as three-qttarteraOf the population of the&apos;Saar Basin belong to the workingclasses and as the metal-workers and the miners of Lorrainehad downed tools for the greater part of the month.   Boththe metal works and the miners of Lorraine maintain the closest contact with their comrades of the Saar, and carried on in their midst an active propaganda to induce thelatter to throw in their lot with them.   When, about theend of the month, the railwayman of Lorraine proclaimed astrike, they did not fail to exhort the employees on the saar lines to follow their example.     These incitementsmet with no resoonso in the Territory.too ;joverman commission must, novercneiess, not do too optimistic.   The proximity of a much-troubled Germany and of alsace-Lorraine, where strides are of frequent occurrence, aswell as tho difficulties, cleverly exploited, which tho setting upof a new administrative regime entails; make it incumbent upon theCommission to face tho possibility of grave occurrences.     There
is no guarantee that the Saar Basin will be soared political strides, such as nave occurred in several territories whore a plebiscite was taon, Jor. ins19no0 , in Uppar Silesia and tho Eupen-Halmedy area.     But tho 0 warning Commission to ice 3 pleasure in recording that in the tir-e months which have elapsed sinco its asoumption of pawar it has successfully uphold, amidst troublod neighbours, the reign of low and or do 2 upon t.10 Saar Basin Territory, in loyal fulfilment - of the mandate with which it was entrusted by the league of nations.(Signed)     V.
