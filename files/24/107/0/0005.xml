Military Secret. 1389From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India,2nd June 1920.(Repeated to Teheran and Meshed,)(Received 3rd.)Priority A.679 S. Reference Minister at Teheran&apos;s telegram 301 of 23rd May. Owing to difficulties as regards water, first actual (corrupt group) movement of troops from Meshed cannot begin until early in July. By the time that Bolsheviks on Enzeji front become aware that withdrawal from Meshed is in progress, Enzeli situation may have been satisfactorily settled. On the other hand, if after another month Enzeli situation has become increasingly serious, this in our opinion will of itself constitute additional and weighty reason for withdrawal of Meshed force with least possible delay before it becomes involved locally. The smallness of Meshed force and the length and vulnerability of lines of communication render it a tempting bait to Afghan aggression, and its maintenance is draining us dry of transport which may be urgently required elsewhere and cannot be replaced from India.We are therefore reluctantly compelled strongly to oppose Cox&apos;s suggestion to retain force at Meshed for even a day after commencement of withdrawal becomes practicable.
