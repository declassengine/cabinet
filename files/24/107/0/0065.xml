Htol.l357&quot;ffo. 7bV- Cols. 124J&quot;- i244tt&apos; Pensions..) 49. MR. CHARLES TOTS asked the Prime Minister whether he is aware of the distress existing amongst ex-service pensioners and their dependants owing to the continually increasing cost of living; that since the present pension scale became operative the cost of living, as shown by official figures, has largely incroaa*v ed; and that the Royal Warrant of 6th December, 1919* stipulates that no re-adjustment of pensions in consequence of the rise or&apos; fall in the cost of living shall take effect before 1st April, 1923; and whether, under the exceptional circumstances, he will recommend the Government to increrase pensions to ex-service men and their dependants on the same basis that increase of wages is paid to railwaymen and others, namely, that where the cost of living increases by 5&quot; per cent., a corresponding increase shallrbe made in pensions, such increase to be retrospective to 1st January, 1920?(A.)       MR; BONAR LAW (Leader of the House):   The pensions of ex-service men and their dependants were revised last September, at a rest of  22,000,000 per annum, when, apart from an increase in tfce flat rate of pension ample to cover any;increase in the cost of living to that date, many other benefits were given such as
the wife&apos;s allowance&apos; of 10s. a week.   Aft-ar rory oanredTul .6oiv sideration it was..de-eided to denl with future flu^uatious in the cost of living as follows.   Tho continuance of rates ofIpension &quot;based on the cost of living in 1919 was guaranteed to 31st March, 1923, at which doin (and thereafter annually) the rate^of &quot;pension will, subject to a minimum flat rate of 33s* a week in any oase, be varied up or down according as the cost cf living in the previous year is above or below the figure in 1919.I am aware that the cost of living in the first, five months of 1920 somewhat exceeds the cost of living in 1919* but it is obviously, impossible that the State should increase rates of pension all round to meet increaues in the&quot; cost of living while not reducing them in the event of a fall.   I see no reason for supposing that the pensioners would benefit on the whole from a continually fluctuating rate of pension as.compared with the guarantee they now&apos;enjoy that there will be rio reduction for three years.   The immense number of pensions now paid and the fact that it is necessary to issue the appro^ priate documents (pay books, etc.) three months in advance would in any case render impracticable alterations in the rates at frequent intervals.
