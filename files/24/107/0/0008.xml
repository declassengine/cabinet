(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CABINET.SECRET. - 3RAILWAYMENrS WAGES.MEMORANDUM FOR THE CABINET BY THE MINISTER OF /TRANSPORT.It will be remembered that during the War the men employed on the Railways in what are known as the Conciliation Grades - that is men engaged in the working and manipulation of traffic and the maintenance of the permanent way* * received war wages in addition to the pre-war rates, and that at the time of the armistice the war-wage amounted to 33/- per week; making an increase in the wage bill to these men of approximately  35,000,000.In addition the principle of an elghti*hcur day had been acknowledged, and the Government had undertaken to consider sympathy etlcally after the end of hostilities Other demands of the men.Following on the Armistice both the National Union of Railwayman and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen put forward demands, and a long period of negotiations followed.The eight-hour day was brought into operation in February 1919, and&apos; in March a settlement was come to as to overtime and Sunday dutyrates, a guaranteed week, a guaranteed day, holidays etc.     The costbetweenof these concessions involved an increase in the wage-bill of/eleven and twelve million pounds.    Further&apos;negotiations as to rates of wages followed, and in August a settlement was come to as to the locomotivemen, drivers being placed on a scale rising from 12/- a day to 15/- after 8 years service as compared with rates varying from 5/6 to 9/- in the pre-war period with similar large advances to firemen and cleaners.Increased rates for the other grades were offered, but not accepted, and a strike at short notice followed in September.
On October 5th a settlement was effected on the &quot;basis that negotiations should be resumed forthwith.This was done, and it was ultimately agroed that each grade other than the locomotive grades should receive as an abnormal weekly wage a rate &quot;based on the average prewar rate of the grade + 38/^ representing an increase in the wage bill of about  100,000 a week.      This increase was to be subject to a sliding scale involving an increase or reduction of l/- a week for each rise or fall of 5 points in the cost of living above the-prewar cost, the increase at the time of settlement being estima-ted at 125% in accordance with the Ministry of Labour figures. Seduction in the wages of any grade   was to cease when the rate had come down to a level of approximately IQOfo above the prewar rate.Under this arrangement the men received an increase of l/-a week in April, and a further 2/- has now accrued, the cost of living being 140^ above the prewar costs.     It had been agreed as part of the settlement in Odtober 1919 that machinery should be set up to&apos;deal with future Claims by the men, apart from the negotiations then in progress.    This machinery consisted of a Central Wages Board composed of an equal number of representatives of the Railway Management and the men, and a national Wages Board composed of 4 representatives -each of Railway Management, Men and Users with an independent Chairman appointed by the Government. Claims as to Wages and conditions of service were to be dealt with in the first instance by the   Central Board, and if that body oould not come to an agreement were to be referred to the National Board. There was an understanding that no strike was to take place until one month after a -claim had been so referred.
r-fIn March and April both Unions put forward fresh claims, the National Union of Railwaymen asking for an addition of  1 a week for men of all grades, and the Associated-Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen asking for -a rate of 20/- a day for drivers, 15/- for firemen and. 10/- for engine cleaners, with increased overtime and Sunday rates, etc. These claims were referred to the Central Board, which agreed to an increase to the locomotive men of 5/- a week in view of the increased cost of living since the settlement of August last, subject to the sliding scale which had not hitherto applied to locomotive men.The Central Eoard could not however come to any agreement as to other demands and the matter was referred to the National Board, of which Sir William Mackenzie,Chairman of the Industrial Court, had been appointed Chairman.That body has^now issued its findings signed by the Chairman, the 4 Users of Railways, the 4 representatives of Railway Labour, and 3 of the 4 Railway Managers who served on the Board at the request of the GovernmenteThe arguments, adduced by the men were mainly based &apos; on the advances that have been received by the Miners, by the Police, and specially by the Dockworkers under the report of Lord Shaw1 a Committee.,This report which recommended for a dock labourer a higher daily rate of wage than an engine driver receives had rendered, the position most difficult, and the Board has recommended increases of pay to the railwaymen varying for the different grades from a minimum increase of 2/- a week.
in agricultural areas to a maximum of 8/6d a week in industrial areas.     TJhis is in addition to the increases under the sliding scale, and the total increased yearly cost under the &apos;2 headings is estimated approximately at  6,000,000, and  4,.000,000, respectively.The claim of the National Union of Railwayman if conceded in full would have involved on increased yearly cost of some  28,000,000 and of the concessions no*w recommended  4,000,000 accrued automatically under the sliding scale which will apply to the further increase now recommended as cost of living falls.The other claims of the A.S.L.E.F. as to overtime and Sunday rates etc. have been rejected by the National Board, and that Board also includes in its findings the following note-worthy paragraph.&quot;In publishing their conclusions the Board express the view that the settlement should not be diaturbed for such period as will facilitate a return to that stability of industry and commerce which is so necessary to-the well being of the community^    This expression of view is without prejudice to alterations of rates consequential upon changes in the cost of living,&quot;It will be necessary for me to issue directions to the controlled Railway Companies to give effect to the findings      the National Wages Board and this I propose to do forthwith*The increase is to become operative as from the 14th June, This Memorandum is submitted for the information of my Colleagues.ERIC GEDDES.Ministry of Transport, 5th June, 1920,
