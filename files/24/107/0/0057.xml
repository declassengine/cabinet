(THIS DOCUMENT 13 TH3 PROPSKTI OP HIS BlilTAHHIO IIAJ^STY^ GOVlCTiffiilT) 0,P.1458 (Revised)MOHAIIDIJIl 3701 j THE GABIHlilT BY THE MTCSICER OF TIMSPO^iT^ In CP. 1408 I explained the effect of theto Railv/a-yi&apos;iien!s Tfages in Great.Britain, which the Board recommended should take effect from the.14th of JuneA It is now urgently necessary that I should be&apos; enabled&apos; to communicate the Government^ decision to Mr. Thomas of the II.U.R, and Mr. Bromley of the A.S.L.E.the Agreement take effect from the Frist day of the new quarter, based on the index number for the preceding . month.    The liarch index figure justified an increase of l/- from the 1st of April;    but in view of the withdrawal of the Bread Subsidy, the Board recommends that a further increase of  /- based on the April figures should take effect exceptionally as from the 12th of April.     They also recommend that in order to avoid clerical labour in compiling the actual amounts due retrospectively in respect of overtime, etc., payment should be at the flat rate of 2/od per week, for the period 12th April to loth June.According to the latest estimates of the Railway Companies, the annual cost of this increase under the sliding scale is  2,400,000,    This is automatic and the Cabinet have not any option as to its acceptance or otherwise.CABINET.recent findings of the national Wages Board in regardIncreases due under the Sliding Scale tinderApart
Apart from the automatic advances under the sliding scale, the costs of the new advances In the rates of wages to all grades covered by the findings of the National YJages Board is ; ut at  7,000,000 a year.    These advances are to apply from the 14th of June.The total annual increase for Great Britain in cost is thus  9,400,000, exclusive of consequential concessions, if any, which have to be granted to grades not covered by the findings.The findings of the National Wages Board do not apply to the Irish Railways;    but I think it will be necessary to extend to Ireland the increase on the sliding scale, and increase in the rates.of wages on a similar percentage to those given by the Board for Great Britain.     The number who would be affected is about 20,000 and the increased cost would amount to about a further  450,000.Apart from these items of increased expenditure, other wages awards, (such as those to the Engineers), the rise in the cost of coal and in the price of stores and material have already overthrown the equilibrium introduced into the Railway budget by the increase in goods rates which took effect on the 15th January last.    These factors would, in themselves, have involved a further revision of Rates and Pares at an early date, and the combined effect of all the additions to Railway expenditure make a heavy and immediate addition in Railway charges imperative if a subsidy is to avoided.
I am investigating the whole position and will shortly be able to frame an estimate of the deficiency to be met in the current financial year;   but in the meantime I think it right that my colleagues should not authorise the acceptance of these findings without having some indication of the railway financial situation as it has recently developed.The Railway Companies of Great Britain have submitted a table to me which shows that they estimate that (including the recent findings of the National Wages 3oard and previous increases under the Sliding Scale) they are nowfailing to meet working expenses and the guaranteed net ro-i.ceipts by  52-jV millions.    The figures are not supported by adequate details and I am hot, thereforej able to accept them or submit them to the Cabinet as re3.able data.Estimates have been prepared in the Ministry which show I think beyond doubt that there will be at least a  -shortage of some  30,000,000, so that even if this lower figure is established as the correct one the position is very serious.     To avoid a subsidy substantial increases in charges must be mada to take effect at the earliest possible moment,transportation is not entirely comparable with other commodities *    It is, in the main, a necessity;   but there is a large marginal business liable to be lost or diverted and it is thus difficult to forecast whether large increases in charges would produce the necessary additional net revenue.    This danger was pointed out to the National Wages Board by one of the Railway witnesses who stated:-&quot;There is an economic point beyond which we &quot;cannot sell (Transportation).     I cannot say, &quot;and 1 do not think anyone can say, when we &quot;shall reach it, but the breaking point will come/
ncome, and when It comes, we aha 11 not be able: &quot;to sell the thing that we are out to sell&quot;.Evidence of this kind clearly impressed the Board who deal with this aspect of the question on page 12 of their Report.    They recognise that somewhere a point is reached at which increases in rates would produce no additional revenue, and may so displace or arrest traffic as to result in loss instead of gain, and further that increases in coat of railway working may be followed by serious unemployment.It ia for the Cabinet to decide whether the findings of the Rational Wages Board should be accepted, and whether I should be authorised at once to Issue a direction to put the increases into force in Great Britain from the dateg recommended, and to extend them as necessary to Ireland.If the Cabinet come to a decision that the finding! should be accepted, I think they should decide as to whether the findings like other wages awards should be accepted without qualification, and It is for consideration, in view of the danger &amp;  placing too hoary a burden on Transportation, whether tho application of the findings should not be limited either for a definite temporary period or be subject to revision if experience proves that the economic level of charges has beott exceeded.    It is only fair to remember that whilst the Railway workers are receiving a post-war wage, the return on capital hag remained at the pre-war level, and has to bear the heavy Income tax and in future be subject to the new Corporation Tax.Ministry of Transport, 15th June, 1920.miC OHDDES,
