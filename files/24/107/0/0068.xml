SECRET. &apos;THE CABINET.BRITISH MILITARY LIABILITIES.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1 circulate to my colleagues two papers by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff     79 and the Chief of the Air Staff on the present state of our military and aerial&apos;resources    1164 and their relations to our commitments.The situation is one which requires a general review and a number of specific decisions. I am sure we are trying to do too much with our present forces and certainly it is impossible, within the present financial limits for me to continue to meet the varied and numerous obligations of our policy. I submit the following specific questions about which I feel we ought to reach conclusions : 1. Are we to defend Persia or not ? If we do not, Persia will be demoralized by Russian Bolshevism and thereafter devoured by Russian Imperialism. If we do we shall, in all probability, find ourselves drawn into a very considerable and indefinite entanglement. It Beems very easy to send a few hundred men to Teheran ; we shall not find it so easy to take them away.2. Are we to go on with the policy of trying to reduce our garrison in Mesopotamia at the end of this financial year to half what it was at the beginning ? If so, I think we must at once evacuate Persia and abandon, for a certain number of years at any rate, Mosul, and withdraw everywhere to our railheads. This means leaving our many half-fulfilled responsibilities in the extended regions which have been occupied to the mercy of the Arabs and Kurds. On the other hand, a decision to make our will effective by vigorous action in the Mosul area must delay indefinitely that process of military reduction which I have been enforcing severely upon the Commander-in-Chief in Mesopotamia.3. Are we in regard to Mesopotamia and, later on, Palestine to transfer the CP. 1320 military responsibilities for maintaining internal order from the War Office to the Air ^ p41^ Ministry, as indicated in the various papers on this subject I circulated some   * &apos; weeks ago ?4. Are we to proceed to reduce our garrison at Constantinople to the quota agreed upon with France and Italy, i.e., six battalions apiece? If we do, who will have the command ? Will the disunited tripartite army be sufficient to defend Constantinople from the Turkish Nationalists and to maintain order in the city? Alternatively, are we to hold on with the effective British control by land and sea, in spite of the cost and of the odium, until the situation develops a good deal further ?5. What Department is to be responsible for the civil administration of . Mesopotamia ?   And, secondly, not necessarily simultaneously, is that same Department to be responsible for Palestine and Egypt ?&quot;v.,,.&quot;Prompt and clear decisions on these points would greatly facilitate departmental administration.W. S. C.The War Office,15th June, 1920.(B20/281)   100  6/20  h&amp;s  S314-two

This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.iTHE CABINET.BRITISH MILITARY LIABILITIES.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The War Office,15th June, 1920.
This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.SECRET.THE CABINET.BRITISH MILITARY LIABILITIES.I circulate herewith a memorandum by the General Staff, together with a minute by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.W.S. c.The War Office, 15th June, 1920.Secretary of State,1. The attached memorandum on British Military Liabilities has been drawn up primarily with a view to forecasting the necessary arrangements to be made for moves during the forthcoming trooping season and to give the Ministry of Shipping the information for which they are pressing.The situation revealed by this review is most, disquieting. I would respectfully urge that the earnest attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government may be given to this question with a view to oui; policy being brought into some relation with the military forces available to support it.   At present this is far from being the case. \2. Is it realized that at the present moment we have absolutely no reserves whatever (in formations) with which to reinforce our garrisons in any part of the world where an emergency may at any moment develop without warning ?3. The present garrison in Ireland is 1,500 rifles below the minimum of 25,000, and a considerable number even of these are both immature and only partially trained.4. The garrison of Great Britain, consisting as it does almost entirely of raw recruits and newly-formed units with many young and inexperienced officers, is even now below the strength of 30,000 rifles which has been laid down as the minimum required to preserve internal order in case of industrial trouble, and from this attenuated force six more infantrv battalions are being held in readiness to move to Ireland at short notice, in addition to the two recently despatched.5. The Army Reserve is practically non-existent (see Adjutant-General&apos;s paper attached), and we have no means of mobilising even one complete division for service abroad, except by breaking up other formations in this country and thereby still further depleting the minimum garrisons. At the same time the situation in India and the Middle East is such that we may at any moment be called on to send a force of from 3 to 5 divisions to succour the British garrisons in those territories, which have been for
many months, and are now, strained to the utmost in policing vast areas under conditions of hardship and discomfort which militate against discipline, training and contentment. Up till the present the prestige of British arms and confidence in the justice of British administration have saved us from such disasters as now threaten to overwhelm the French in Syria and Cilicia, but there are not wanting signs that this respite will not be of unlimited duration. .6. I cannot too strongly press on the Government the danger, the extreme clanger, of His Majesty&apos;s Army being spread all over the world, strong nowhere, weak ev^ery-where, and wbh no reserve to save a dangerous situation or to avert a coming danger. And I would add a word of warning about the continued discomfort of the troops, whether in Persia or Mesopotamia, in Egypt or in Palestine, in the Black Sea or in Ireland, a discomfort both for the troops and for the married families, which not only militates against training and discipline, but which may very easily develop into a discontent which would be disastrous alike to the Army and the Empire.Although it is not my province to offer advice as to policy, I may perhaps be pardoned for suggesting the lines on which relief may be afforded to our highly tried troops.   My proposals, therefore, are as follows : (i.) The withdrawal of our 3 battalions from the Plebiscite areas. ,(ii.) The reduction of the Army of the Black Sea to 6 battalions and the necessary complementary troops. This involves the withdrawal of the British garrison from Batoum, which I have constantly advocated, and would mean the withdrawal of 15 battalions from the Army of the Black .Sea. (iii.) The complete withdrawal of British forces from Persia, which will save us 11 battalions. A definite decision on the policy to be observed as regards Persia is imperative; otherwise, not only will no reduction be possible in the present garrison but we shall almost inevitably find ourselves committed to a process of gradual reinforcement which may entail unlimited liabilities. In this connection may I remind the Cabinet of the North Russian Expedition which, beginning with a landing of 150 men at Murmansk, in the absence of a definite policy absorbed nearly 20,000 British troops before it ended.At the same time it is only fair to point out that the Anglo-Persian Agreement . was negotiated last year without &quot;&quot;any previous reference to the War Office, and therefore the General Staff were given no opportunity of expressing an opinion as to military commitments thereby involved or as to the possibility of meeting them. Since then our scanty forces have been strained to the utmost limit of safety aud endurance in furtherance of the Foreign Office policy, although the latter appears to lack the support of His Majesty&apos;s Government as a whole, since financial provision has not been made for the maintenance of the necessary troops nor for the construction of the essential railways. The time has now arrived when this situation can no longer continue, and I must respectively press for a definite answer to the following question : Is it the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to incur the financial burden of maintaining a strong force in Persia in support of the Anglo-Persian Agreement, bearing in mind that this policy may entail the eventual possibility of war with Russia in these regions ? .If this is not their intention, there is no other course now open to us from a military point of view but to withdraw British and Indian troops entirely from Persia and to concentrate such forces as we have for the defence and security of those territories for which this country is directly responsible.7. If the above proposals are accepted, the saving effected (apart from machine-gun units equivalent to 6 battalions and 1 cavalry regiment) will amount to : 	British.	Indian.	Total.

1  .254I.-NOTE BY THE GENERAL STAFF ON BRITISH MILITARY LIABILITIES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO MOVES OF BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE TROOPING SEASON, 1920-21.1. Towards the end of 1919 the General Staff summarized the British liabilities     20 as they then existed.   Based on this paper, provisional establishments for all garrisons    (J.n. were drawn up, which formed the basis for compiling Army Estimates.   Since that       9 time the situation has been modified in many of the theatres in question, and in order to make the necessary arrangements for reliefs, movement of drafts, &amp;c, during the ensuing trooping season, it is necessary that the whole question should be reviewed, and that decisions should be given on which plans can be based.2. Broadly speaking, our liabilities may be grouped under the following heads: (a.) Overseas (1(a(3(i(5 (7(b.) Home India.Mesopotamia. North Persia. Egypt. Palestine.Oversea defended ports, including Aden. Army of the Rhine. Army of the Black Sea. Plebiscite area.(1.) Ireland.(2.) Internal defence of Great Britain.(3.) Provision of an expeditionary force as a reserve to deal with emergencies in all theatres.It is proposed tb deal with these on the supposition that existing arms will be utilized. It is certain that the new weapons such as aeroplanes, tanks and armoured cars will not be available in sufficient numbers to affect the situation during the ensuing trooping season,3. India. The Indian Government has not modified its previous demands in any important respect, and will require on ordinary peace establishments 45 British infantry battalions.8 British cavalry regiments. 11 Field Artillery brigades.6 Mountain Artillery brigades (each containing one British battery).3 Heavy Artillery brigades (less one battery).5 Coast defence companies.5 or 6 R.H.A. batteries.The temporary machine gun units, 5 machine gun corps battalions and 3 machine gun corps squadrons, will disappear when the additional infantry and cavalry are supplied. ......On a previous occasion the Viceroy estimated that in the event of serious internal trouble British reinforcements amounting to 4 divisions and 4 cavalry brigades wouldMost of the Indian units thus rendered surplus are due for repatriation, which will result in a big financial saving to the Treasury, and will enable the early reorganization of the Indian Army on a peace basis to be completed.From the 10 British infantry battalions so saved we shall be able to send five battalions to complete lndia&apos;s requirements, and one to Hong Kong, placing the remaining four battalions in reserve as may be most convenient.HENRY WILSON, Field-Marshal,Chief of the Imperial General Staff., &apos;dth June, 1920.
be required. Since that date, however, the attitude of Afghanistan has directed attention mainly towards the North-West frontier. Opinion is unanimous that nothing short of the occupation of both Kabul and Kandahar can be relied upon to crush the Afghans, and India estimates that in the existing state of the Indian forces the following reinforcements would be required from home&apos; to&apos; ensure the success of the operations: 3 infantry divisions. 2 cavalry regiments.1 horse artillery battery. .   *A large amount of medical, signal, and motor transport personnel and units.From the above it is clear that no reduction on the previous estimates of India&apos;s requirements for her peace garrison can be anticipated in the near future, but that on the contrary we shall be pressed to complete her unfulfilled demands.20 4. Mesopotamia.   The interim garrison, as estimated in accordance  with&amp;eD- No- paragraph 1, amounted to 2 Indian divisions.1 Tndian cavalry brigade.At the present time the British troops in Mesopotamia comprise 7 British infantry battalions. 2 British cavalry regiments. 2 brigades, R.F.A. 2 British mountain batteries. 1 heavy battery.3 armoured car companies (forming).In a recent telegram (No. X 8685, cipher, 14th May, printed as Appendix B) written, however, before recent events at Enzeli, the General Officer Commanding estimated that by progressive reductions he might by December, 1920, be able to release : 2 infantry brigades (including 2 British infantry battalions).2 cavalry regiments (1 of which might be British),1 brigade, R.F.A., less 1 battery.Brigade headquarters and 3 Indian mountain batteries.At a later stage, and subject to all remaining units being brought up to strength^ and the situation remaining normal, the General Officer Commanding foreshadowed a further reduction by : 3 Indian battalions.1 British mountain battery.1 field battery.1 Indian cavalry regiment. *This would leave him with the following British troops : 5 infantry battalions. \1 cavalry regiment. 1 B.H.A. battery. 1 RF.A. brigade.1 mountain artillery brigade (including 1 British battery).1 heavy battery.3 armoured car companies.It appears, however, that these estimates may be entirely upset by recent develop-ments in Persia, while in view of the threatening situation now developing on the Euphrates, as to which the Civil Commissioner expresses grave anxiety in his 3899 of the 15th May (Appendix D), there appears little or no chance of effecting reductions on the above scale, whilst the possibility of having to despatch reinforcements cannot be* In a telegram to the Secretary of State, the General Officer Commanding made the further stipulations that the Royal Air Force should be completed to establishment, and that tanks, additional armoured cars and water transport personnel should be provided, none of which, however,.are available.
disregarded.   Whatever the possibilities of replacing troops \j aircraft in the futuremay be, at the present moment the impotence of the Royal Air Force in Mesopotamia to carry out even their present tasks becomes clearer every day.(For note on effectives see Appendix E.)5. Persia. At the present time the garrison in Persia consists of: 1 British infantry battalion. G Indian infantry battalions.2 squadrons Indian cavalry (detached from Mesopotamia). ..1 Indian mountain battery.1 E.H.A. battery (detached from Mesopotamia).In addition to the above two British infantry battalions are under orders to proceed to Kasvin from Mesopotamia, these two battalions being presumably those which might otherwise be reduced by December.*It will be seen, therefore, that our policy in Persia has a determining effect on the number of British units which will be required in Mesopotamia and Persia during the winter 1920-21, and a decision on this point is a matter of urgent importance. In the meantime it must be assumed that no reduction in British infantry or artillery will take place, and that we can only calculate on saving 1 British cavalry regiment.(For note on effectives see Appendix E.)6. Egypt. The interim garrison allowed for Egypt in accordance with Lord Milners proposals consists of 1 Indian division, 1 cavalry brigade,(Comprising the following British units : 7 infantry battalions (including 1 at Khartoum). 1 cavalry regiment.1 R.H.A; battery (detached from brigade in Palestine). 1 KF.A. battery (detached from brigade in Palestine). Detachment of R.G.A. 2 armoured car companies.The present garrison contains only 6 British infantry battalions. -1 British cavalry regiment. 1 R.H.A. battery.1 British mountain battery (detached from Palestine). 1 detachment of R.G. A.the difference being accounted for by the fact that one British battalion has been diverted to Constantinople.In the opinion of the General Officer Commanding [vide Appendix C) the eventualities to be guarded against in Egypt are  \(a.) A general rising of the population and the cutting of all communications.(6.) Local demonstrations and disturbances in the towns which cannot be dealt * with by the police.Though the situation is temporarily quiescent it is necessary to maintain a garrison strong enough to guard against the above eventualities until the results of the Milner Mission are known. The General. Officer Commanding considers that the present garrison, with the exception of 3 Indian infantry battalions guarding prisoners and stores, is the minimum necessary, and that no troops are available from Egypt for reinforcing Palestine. At the present time it does not appear advisable to count on any reduction being possible during the ensuing trooping season. &apos;(For note on effectives see Appendix E.)* Two additional Indian battalions are also moving from Mesopotamia to Persia, 8th June, 1920.
___20 7. Palestine. The&apos;garrison estimated in accordance with paragraph 1 : Gen. No. - T r    . L,   ,    j. . . jgQ^-  1 Indian infantry division,1 Indian cavalry division,and comprises the following British troops : 3 Infantry battalions, 3 Cavalry regiments,1 Brigade headquarters and 1 battery, R.H.A.,2 Brigades, R.F.A. (less 1 battery in Egypt),1 Mountain artillery brigade (including 1 British battery),Brigade headquarters, and 1 heavy battery, R.G.A,The existing garrison corresponds to the above with the exception that it is less-by one Indian cavalry regiment.The General Officer Commanding is of opinion that no reduction of the present garrison is possible so long as there exists the possibility of attack on the north-east frontier, and whilst the feeling between Jews and Mohammedans remains bad. If, however, the situation develops favourably the General Officer Commanding considers that he could dispense with 1 Brigade, R.F.A.,1 Indian cavalry brigade (3 Indian regiments),1 Indian infantry brigade (1 British and 3 Indian battalions),but only on condition that units in Palestine, both British and Indian, are kept up to strength, and that communications by road and telegraph are everywhere improved. This latter question is now under consideration and will involve very considerable expense, the estimate for roads alone being considerably beyond the means of the civil administration. The General Officer Commanding would also require one additional squadron, Royal Air Force, to be located permanently in Palestine. He further remarks that three Indian cavalry regiments would suit the climatic conditions as well, or even better, than British cavalry. On the other hand, from a wider standpoint, tfie British cavalry brigade stationed in Palestine forms a most useful reserve for the whole of the Middle East, and on this assumption, the only reduction in British troops would be one R.F.A. brigade.(For note on effectives see Appendix E.)8. Oversea Defended Ports, including Aden. The garrisons of all Defended Ports have been cut down to the extreme limit, and in some cases beyond it.The British battalion at Hong Kong is at present divided between Hong Kong and North China, thus dangerously weakening the garrison of Hong Kong, while Singapore, Gibraltar and Malta are all short of a battalion.20 9. Army of the Rhine. The existing garrison conforms to that estimated inGen. No. accordance with paragraph 1. 4809 This garrison is maintained entirely for political ends, and its actual strength hasnot been calculated to meet any specific military problem.   So far as the General Staff&apos; are aware no change is contemplated in either strength or composition daring the next trooping season, with the exception of the reduction of one machine gun company.20 10. Army of the Black Sea. The garrison estimated in accordance with paragraph 1Gen. No. consists of:-4809 1 Indian division,3 battalions (1 British and 2 Indian) for Batoum,and comprises the following British units :-4 infantry battalions. 1 machine gun company. 2 brigades, R.F.A.With the exception of the detachment at Batoum, which is of a temporary nature -only, Marshal Foch&apos;s Committee decided that an Allied garrison of 2 divisions, to be reduced later to 1 brigade, would meet requirements in the Straits.-   It is considered, therefore, that the British quota should not exceed 6 battalions, of which 3 might be British.   At the present time, however, we are maintaining no less than 14 Indian
* Since raised to 32. f Unless Persia is evacuated.-battalions and 7 British battalions, 11 of the Indian battalions being overdue for repatriation, and it is proposed, therefore, that arrangements should be made for the repatriation of these 11 battalions without replacement. An early decision is required on this point, as otherwise unnecessary expense will be incurred by raising, or maintaining battalions in India for purposes of relief. This would release 4 British battalions for service elsewhere. It is assumed that the machine-gun company will disappear before the end of this financial year.&apos;11. Plebiscite areas. We are maintaining at the present time a force tof approximately 3,000 all ranks, included in which are  .1 battalion in the Danzig area. 1 battalion in the Allenstein area. 1 battalion in Schleswig.The battalion in Schleswig will be withdrawn in the immediate future. It is hoped that the other two battalions will follow before the winter sets in, and that these two battalions can therefore be counted upon for any re-distribution necessary during the ensuing trooping season.12. Ireland. At the end of 1919 it was considered that 25,000 effective bayonets were required to maintain order in Ireland, in addition to cavalry, artillery, machine gun and other units. Recent events have shown that this estimate erred, if anything, on the side of moderation. At. the present time we are maintaining 30* infantry battalions and 1 machine-gun battalion, with a total effective strength of about 23,000, -of which, however, 3,000 have not fired a musketry course. In addition to the other arms for 2 divisions we are also maintaining 7 cavalry regiments and 1 armoured&quot; car company. As the above troops are clearly insufficient, an additional 8 battalions have had to be warned to be ready to move at short notice, and 2 of these have now actually sailed. We shall, therefore, have to be prepared to maintain in Ireland during the ensuing trooping season a minimum of 38 Regular infantry battalions. The quartering of these additional units during the winter raises a fresh problem as there are no barracks available and accommodation will have to be provided. At this stage it is not possible tc. say whether it will be necessary to retain in Ireland the 7 cavalry regiments, or whether some reduction can be made on replacement by tanks or armoured cars.13. Great Britain. At the present time we have in Great Britain : Line battalions ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...   35Guard battalions...      .:.      ...      ...      ...      ...   10Total battalions ...      ...      ...      ..    45Whilst the cavalry regiments numbered 8, plus 3 weak Household Cavalry regiments.From the Summary in Appendix A it appears that we cannot count on any &apos; increase beyond possibly one battalion,!&quot; against which must be placed the possible reduction of one Guards battalion, and the despatch of additional battalions to Ireland.It has been estimated that a minimum of 30,000 bayonets might be required in support of the&apos; Civil Power, and that sufficient mechanical transport should be available to move 10,000 of the above.Even if all the available battalions in Great Britain were up to authorized establishment, and taking into consideration the number of recruits which are always present, we should fall far short of the 30,000 bayonets.14. Provision of an Expeditionary Force. It is evident that any Expeditionary Force can only be provided at the expense of the troops at Home considered necessary for internal security. It is not possible to say with any certainty what demands may be received from Eastern theatres, but the despatch of reinforcements to either India or Mesopotamia must be kept in -mind. In the most favourable circumstances it might be possible for India to send reinforcements to Mesopotamia, and such a course has great advantages in view of her comparative proximity. It is more probable, however, that if a situation develops in Mesopotamia necessitating the despatch of reinforcements, the
whole of the troops in India would be fully employed in defence of their own country, and that the three divisions and other troops referred to in paragraph 3 would be called for by India simultaneously. The combined demands might well amount to five divisions, leaving out of consideration the possible requirements of Ireland, Egypt, Palestine and Constantinople. For the purposes of this paper, however, it is not necessary to do more than to emphasize the fact that any foreign service units which can be saved from overseas should be maintained at Home as a set-off against that portion of the Expeditionary Force which will inevitably be locked up in Ireland when the emergency arises.15. The distribution of British troops which would result from the foregoing proposals is given in Appendix A.Acceptance of this distribution entails confirmation of the following assumptions :-(i.) Disbandment of all Machine Gun Corps units, (ii.) Completion of India&apos;s garrison (paragraph 2).(iii.) Protection of that portion of Persia within reach of our railhead (paragraph 5).. (iv.) Maintenance of the &quot; Milner &quot; garrison in Egypt (paragraph 6). (v.) Retention of a British cavalry brigade in Palestine (paragraph,7). (vi.) Despatch of a battalion to North China (paragraph 8).(vii.) Reduction of the Army of the Black Sea to six battalions and withdrawal fromBaturn (paragraph 10). (viii.) Withdrawal from Plebiscite areas before the winter sets in (paragraph 11). (ix.) No reduction in the garrison in Ireland and the sending of the remainder ofthe eight additional battalions now under orders (paragraph 12).. 16. It will be observed that the proposals in this paper redistribute the Regular Army and do not show any savings apart from the reduction of Machine-Gun Corps units equivalent to 6 battalions and 1 cavalry regiment. Later on it may be possible to effect reductions in cavalry as an offset to an increase in air power and armoured cars (or tanks), but otherwise the table shows that there will only be 1 British infantry battalion on the foreign service roster available for service at Home, even on the somewhat liberal assumption that the Army of the Rhine and the troops in Ireland maj be counted as on &quot; Home Service.&quot;* Several of the defended ports will be --left undesirably weak, e.g., Gibraltar, Malta, Singapore and Hong Kong. rIn Great Britain we shall have (including the Guards) only some 40 battalions from which to form an Expeditionary Force for overseas, as compared with demands which may well amount to five divisions.Owing, however, to the immaturity of the troops, the weakening of the Reserve, and the shortage of engineers, signal and other technical personnel, it would be a matter of extreme difficulty to raise an Expeditionary Force of even two divisions and one cavalry brigade in any reasonable time, and even this small force would be deficient of many essential services and lines of communication troops, and moreover Great Britain would be left practically unguarded and with no power of action if internal disturbances broke out.It is considered that any economies which may be possible on military grounds or obligatory on financial grounds, must be made by reducing Indian troops, of which there remain considerable numbers in the Black Sea, Egypt and Palestine and in Mesopotamia and Persia.Unless North Persia is entirely evacuated, which would give us three more battalions at home.General Staff,War Office,9th June, 1920.

APPENDIX B.From G.O.O., Mesopotamia, to War Office.Despatched 14th May, 1920, 1735; received 15th, 0800.) (No. X 8685, cipher.   14th May.  For Secretary, of State.)In continuation of my No. X 8629, 3rd May. For Secretary of State. ;i) In the strength return referred to in my (?) previous are shown approximately Indian followers, 70,000 ; local labour, 15,000. The former comprise.in round numbers :.(A) Followers, officers&apos;establishment unit, 23,200; (B) Labour Corps, 20,500; (C) I.W.T., 14,000; (D) Works and Electrical and Mechanical, 7,800; (E) with departments Serjeants whose.reduction is not directly dependent on nor in equal proportion to reduction of troops, 4,500.Of these, (A) will be reduced proportionately to reduction of troops. (B). Labour Corps and local labour and employed on buildings, roads and porter work connected with loading and unloading material, stores and supplies. These will be reduced to some extent together with any reduction of troops, but there is a fixed nucleus included in totals whose numbers are not dependent on number of troops. For instance, of troops (one group undecipherable) necessary reduced work on maintenance of the Persian roads. Also we are furnishing supplies for nearly 80,000 individuals, including (?) refugees, prisoners of war and those who are employed in civil and quasi-civil occupations over and above true military personnel. The separation of porters working to supply these from (?) those working on strictly army supplies is not practicable, but in the Civil Administrators (?) payments for rations the cost which is based on factors including such labour, the cost of the whole total number given, but is false oh army statistics, and these numbers are not a true index to the budget cost.Part II. To dispense totally with this labour, with this result in rise in total strength of local labour, causing increase in the cost of feeding the Army and in harvest and seed time, would not improbably result in breakdown of supply for lack of labour. Additional local labour unobtainable except by compulsion. A reduction in troops, however, would be accompanied by a proportionate reduction in those working on Army supply, and should the civil accept responsibility of the administration of their own organizations which has been pressed for, a yet further reduction in the total numbers of labourers will be possible.0.-The situation regarding I.W.T. has been placed before War Office in my telegram No. Q. 5543/1. Civil administration will not take it over. Until railway carrying capacity expands, river transport is essential. A proportion of tlio work done is remunerative and the cost of the part is paid for in the price of rations as in the case of labour. The reduction of this personnel will also, therefore, be proportional to th e reduction of troops only in regard to that (?) portion of the work carried out for strict military purposes.D.-Works and E. and M.

Part III.   For Secretary of State.Paragraph 4. To summarize my replies. Every effort is being made to effect reductions, and provided the political, air force or military situation (see telegram No. X 86 ( (?) 29), paragraph 4) does not at the time prevent it, I propose the following general outline to give effect to the decision of His Majestys Government: -A. In October, reduction of 1 infantry brigade, 1 cavairy regiment, and 1 brigade, R.F.A., less (?) 1 battery.B.-In November December, reduction of 1 infantry brigade, 1 cavalry regiment, and 1 mountain, artillery brigade, less 1 battery.0. I assume it will also be possible to withdraw and despatch from this country the force in NoVth-Wost Persia beiofe the end of the financial year.. D.-The (?) above will reduce my fighting strength to. half that at present sanctioned and will be accompanied by corresponding reduction, in each case, of engineers, trains, ambulances, &amp;c.E. 1 can foresee further reduction of an infantry corps, 3 battalions, 1 mountain and 1 field battery, and a cavalry regiment, provided that other units are then up to strengtli and the effects of the first reductions seen aiid felt.Paragraph 5-Subject to further examination I have proposed to distribute my best forces on the following general lines: A mixed brigade at Mosul. The main force at Baghdad. Detachments in following areas only: Kirkuk, Hit, Diwania, lliliah, and battery with tanks or light armoured motor cars at a few other places.Paragraph 6. Reduction in auxiliary services and personnel and reserve stores will be necessary to conform with the ^eduction in the fighting personnel; but, as such reductions are depending on acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government of these proposals, the exact figures and dates for carrying out these further reductions, await (?) confirmation as to how far my plans are to be put into execution.Paragraph 7.; The principle of the transference to the Civil Administration of all non-military (?) funds is accepted, but the Civil Administration necessary takes time to perfect its growth and organization and is not yet ready to assume full responsibility of all services.   (?) Perhaps it has been (?) insufficiently explained
that until 1914 this country was occupied by (?) chiefly Eastern nations who not only made no efforts to introduce modern (?) organization but deliberately opposed the inarch of civilization. The British Army and Royal Air Force of to-day demands such essentials as electrical fans, ice, and milk when in hospital. I think unless these services are maintained by the Army all our efforts to ensure better conditions and welfare of the young soldier, to which to-day so much importance is attached, will be rendered nugatory and discontent will pogsibly arise.8. Air Vice-Marshal Salmond is (two groups undecipherable) (?) Conference. (?) If the air scheme is adopted my proposals given above will still apply and further reduction will follow as the air force is increased. -9.

EGYPT AND PALESTINE. (Reference \Yar Office cable No. 84686, M.O. 2, of 28th April, 1920.)I.-EGYPT.1. The present garrison consists of :-2 mixed infantry brigades. 2 Indian infantry brigades. 1 division of -( 3 cavalry regiments.11 batteries, R.H.A. vl mountain battery, R.G.A. 1 independent British brigade of 3 battalions. Khartoum and Sollum garrisons, which do not affect the situation.Total-5 British battalions (not including 1 at Khartoum).13 Indian battalions. 1 British cavalry regiment. 2 Indian cavalry regiments. 1 battery, R.H.A. 1 mountain battery, R.G.A.In addition there are 1 British cavalry regiment and 1 heavy battery, R.G.A., destined for Palestine which are included in this appreciation as part of the Palestine garrison.Three of the above Indian battalions are employed in guarding prisoners of war and surplus stores, and can be dispensed with when all are disposed of. There is one cavalry regiment above Lord Milner&apos;s suggested garrison.   This regiment can be withdrawn now.2. The eventualities to be guarded against in Egypt are : (a ) A general rising of the population and the cutting of all communications.lb.) Local demonstrations and disturbances in the towns which cannot be dealt with by the police.3. For the present all is quiet, but, until the results of the Milner Mission are announced, it is necessary to maintain a force of sufficient size to guard against the above eventualities.4. This force is at present disposed as follows : In each of the four brigade areas of the 10th Division detachments are located in Mudiria and other important towns, so that disturbances may be effectively dealt with at the very outset. In addition, each brigade has a small mobile column in the neighbourhood of brigade headquarters, for use as a brigade reserve.  The division has a very small divisional reserve.The Cairo Brigade is responsible for maintaining order in Cairo and protecting the large European population domiciled there.5. Until the result of the Milner Mission is announced and the situation in Egypt is definitely quiet it is essential that the above garrison be maintained at its present strength, with the exception of 1 cavalry regiment, which can be dispensed with now.3 infantry battalions, which will be dispensed with as and when prisoners of war are repatriated and surplus stores disposed of.6. I could at present spare no troops for reinforcing Palestine, if such reinforcements were required beyond the 1 cavalry regiment mentioned in paragraph 5 above.II. Palestine.1. The present garrison consists of 1 Indian infantry division, consisting of 3 infantry brigades of 1 British and 3 Indian battalions each. 2 brigades, R.F.A.1 mountain brigade, R.G.A. (less 1 battery in Egypt). 1 heavy battery, R.G.A.1 cavalry division, consisting of 1 British brigade of 3 regiments (including 1 regiment still.in Egypt but destined for palestine in the near future). 2 Indian brigades 1 of 3 regiments and 1 of 2 regiments. 1 battery, R.H.A.(8314) 0
The Indian cavalry brigade of 3 regiments and the battery, R.H.A., are attached to the Indian infantry division.  The reserve in Palestine therefore, at present, consists of: 1 British cavalry brigade.  This brigade is composed of newly-formed and untrained regiments andis not yet properly fit to take the field. 1 Indian cavalry brigade of 2 regiments.2. The situation in Palestine is still far from quiet.(a.) Rioting on a large scale has only recently taken place in Jerusalem. Feeling between Jews and Moslems is running high, and the presence of troops in all towns will be necessary for some time to come, particularly when the Peace Treaty is announced.(b.) Constant raids by tribes from east of the Jordan have taken place, and a serious attack was made on Beisan and Semakh. This attack was repulsed but there is likelihood of further raids being made, as aeroplane reconnaissances and intelligence reports show large encampments on the north-east and eastern frontiers of Palestine, in which the Damascus Government is quite likely implicated.3. Owing t&apos;o the withdrawal of men from cavalry and infantry units to reinforce ancillary services, all British regiments and battalions are much below establishment.In addition, several of the Indian battalions which have recently arrived from India in relief of units of this force, are very weak.4. Communications by road, rail and telegraph are bad.5. So long as there is a possibility of an attack being carried out on our north-east frontier by Arabs, either directly or indirectly under orders from Damascus, I do not consider that any reduction in the Palestine garrison would be safe.If, on the other hand, Damascus and the Arabs of Palestine accept the Turkish Peace Treaty and the new area, which includes safe, Banias and Kuneitra, does not precipitate conflict, I could dispense with one brigade, R.F.A., one Indian cavalry brigade and one Indian infantry brigade, but it would he on the conditions that the units in Palestine (both British and Indian) are kept up to strength, and that communications by road and telegraph are everywhere improved.I consider that one additional squadron, Royal Air Force, should be permanently located in Palestine.6. On a reduction being carried out as above the troops in Palestine would be disposed as follows . 1 mixed brigade safe area, to safeguard North and North-East Frontier. 1 cavalry regiment. 2 infantry battalions. 1 battery, R.F.A. 1 mountain battery, R.G.A.1 mixed brigade Jenin area, to safeguard eastern frontier.2 cavalry regiments. 2 infantry battalions. 1 battery, R.F.A. 1 mountain battery, R.G.A.Divisional reserve. Ludd area and Jerusalem.1 cavalry brigade. &apos;  1 infantry brigade.1 R.F.A. brigade (less 2 batteries).1 mountain artillery brigade (less 3 batteries).1 heavy battery, R.G.A.7. If the brigade of cavalry is withdrawn, I should prefer to dispense with the British brigade and to keep two Indian brigades, as they are more suited to the climatic conditions of Palestine than British cavalry. I have already previously recommended to you the retention of Indian cavalry in Palestine in preference to British.W.

Zaid) will shortly reach Albu Kamal. A fresh campaign of intensive propaganda is being launched. The sums of money which are being lavished upon tribes are so large that there seems little doubt that a sum equal to whole British subsidy to Syria is being devoted to this purpose.Seizure of Dair-uz-Zor was first step in campaign of penetration from Syria to Mesopotamia.

APPENDIX E.NOTE ON THE STATE OF THE EFFECTIVES IN THE VARIOUS THEATRES.(a.) India.At the present moment India is short of authorized establishment of the units actually in the country by over 6,000 British personnel. In addition she is maintaining 5 temporary machine-gun battalions and 3 temporary machine-gun squadrons owing to our inability to supply 5 infantry battalions and 1 cavalry regiment.  She is also short of a certain number of British mountain batteries and armoured cars.(I.) Mesopotamia.The actual establishment allowed for in Estimates is 16,000 British personnel, of which at the present time Mesopotamia is 3,000 deficient, the large majority of which are in the Administrative Services. The effect of this on infantry battalions may be judged from the fact that when 2 British battalions were recently sent 4from Karind towards Kasvin they could only move on a total strength of 600 as compared with the authorized establishment of 1,800. The effect of drawing on immature British units to supply deficiencies in technical services has been disastrous to the efficiency not only of the units themselves but also the services into which they have been drafted, and results into a lamentable lack of efficiency as compared to the numbers paid for.As regards Indian troops, there is at the present time a large nominal surplus over authorized establish-ment, chiefly due to the presence in the country of relieving and relieved battalions, prisoners of war, &amp;c. Actually, however, the total fighting value has been considerably decreased owing to the replacement of seasoned battalions, including Gurkhas, by new and less efficient units.In a recent telegram the local authorities estimated that the fighting value of the garrison of Mesopotamia, which nominally amounted to 2 divisions and 2 cavalry brigades, did not exceed that of 1 division and 1 cavalry brigade on a war footing.(c.) Persia. The above remarks apply generally to Persia.(d.) Egypt and Palestine.The deficiency in British personnel amounts to over 4,000 out of an establishment of 22,000; this deficiency being mainly in the Technical and Administrative Services. Consequently, we have the same conditions reproduced as in Mesopotamia, by which combatant British units are drawn upon in order to supply deficiencies in Technical Services, with resulting detriment to both. The training and efficiency of the troops also is seriously affected by the absence of proper accommodation, which renders conditions almost as arduous as those of active service, with none of the compensations. British cavalry regiments, in particular, are reported as being at present unfit to take the field.(e.) Army of the Rhine.The Army of the Rhine is some 3,000 short of authorized establishment, the deficieuces being almost entirely in technical services. As, however, the troops are concentrated and well housed, these deficiencies-do not make themselves seriously felt, and would only do so in the event of the forces being called upon to undertake active operations.(/.) Army op the Black Sea.The British troops are nominally up to establishment, but unfortunately there is here again a shortage of certain essential technical personnel, more particularly in the Signal Service. On the whole, however, the British troops in this army are better situated than in Mesopotamia, Egypt or Palestine, owing to the fact that they are well housed, comparatively concentrated, and therefore able to do some modicum of training. A large proportion of the Indian troops, however, have not seen their homes for many years, which cannot but exercise some effect on their contentment, and therefore on their efficiency.(8314)Government have given us verbally and in writing to understand that there will be no cessation of hostilities on this front until we have withdrawn to Wadi Hauran south (of) Ana. Already made good their words, and for last week our troops have daily been in action against well-organized raids. Occupation of Ana third step, and if made effectively by Arab Government would imperil our position at Mosul. ?he.e are indications that in near future we may be faced with a recrudescence of fanatical pan-^rab activity with aims and methods closely similar to those of their colleagues in Syria and Egypt. An announcement of the constitution that we propose for this country unlikely to have any appreciable effect on this agitation; population led by extremists whose cry is complete independence, exclusive of any sort of foreign influence and complete withdrawal of all foreign military forces. The fact that complete anarchy is imminent is nothing to them. They have grown fat on anarchy in Syria; Syria,is exhausted, and they seek to revitalize their parasitic(aJ) existence by fastening themselves on this country. The people of this country outside the towns are well armed, warlike, and highly susceptible to agitation.&apos; Our problem is admirably stated in a letter of 10th April to &quot; National,&quot; to which I beg reference.[ think Committee should know that so far from having three squadrons which were promised by middle of April, we have to-day only available in Mesopotamia 8 obsolete B.E. 8 machines in working order, three D.H. 9a machines. Eight B.E. 8 machines constitute the available reserve machines that can be built. His Majesty&apos;s Government are paying, I believe, for three squadrons (?), one squadron has come out with machines unsuitable for use in this country in their present condition (?) other is still in Egypt. I have already represeuted situation in this country as dangerous, vide my telegram of 4th March. I beg to do so again. Unless His Majesty&apos;s Government and Parliament are prepared to find and support forces to maintain order in this country, maintain aviation efficiently when here, the coming autumn is bound to usher in a wave of anarchic energy which will swamp us, and with us Persia. Further concession in a constitutional direction will not affect this issue.The foregoing has been fully discussed with General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, in which he desires me to express his entire concurrence.
II-NOTE BY THE ADJUTANT-GENERAL ON TROOPS AVAILABLE IN GREAT BRITAIN FOR MOBILIZATION IN CASE OF EMERGENCY.1. A. In the event of it being desired to mobilize any force for the purpose of meeting an emergency, it will be necessary to leave out of consideration those troops which are now quartered in Ireland, or are about to proceed thither. There are consequently only 39 infantry battalions available, of which 10 are Guards, 7 are Irish battalions and accordingly unavailable for service in Ireland. There are, moreover, 5 foreign service battalions in the United Kingdom due to go abroad&quot; next trooping season. They are all being concentrated in Great Britain, the 4 battalions now in Ireland being under orders to . proceed to Great Britain at end of June on relief. From the troops quartered in Great Britain, 1 cavalry division and 2 divisions could be formed, comprising the necessary number of units other than Royal Engineers, but without any lines of communication troops. 1 division would be formed from the 1st and 2nd Divisions at Aldershot, which include six battalions of Guards now in London District; one division from the 3rd and 4th Divisions and one cavalry division from seven cavalry regiments and the three Household Cavalry regiments. 15 battalions, of which 4 are Guards and 1 is in Jersey, and 2 Household Cavalry regiments will then remain. These 2 divisions and the cavalry division would be without any Royal Engineers or signal units, but would otherwise be complete in the number of their units, but the units themselves would be generally much below establishment.As the Military Transfer Act is not now in operation it is certain that the majority of these infantry battalions would be deficient of the reservists required to bring them up to war establishment, and that not even one division complete in personnel could be mobilized. Even after such reservists as do exist have been called out, the units- would consist to a large extent of men whose training is incomplete and who would either have only just reached the age of 19 or be below that age.B. In order to bring the Home Service units stationed in Great Britain, Ireland and on the Rhine up to War Establishment so as to enable a force of 6 divisions, 1 cavalry division, and Army troops to be mobilized, but excluding all lines of communication units, approximately 140,000 Reservists are required. The present, strength of the Army Reserve Is approximately 58,000, but it is known that only a proportion of that total is available as, owing to the want of power of transfer, the men cannot be placed where they are required. The exact position of the Army Reserve is being investigated.It it necessary to have direct enlistments into the Reserve (a.) To produce the personnel required.(6.) To distribute this personnel to the Arms and Corps of the Service as necessary.As regards mobile reserve in Great Britain, after the 2 divisions referred to in paragraph (A) have been mobilized, we shall have only 14 battalions (excluding the battalion in Jersey but inclusive of 4 Guards battalions), so that if all the infantry in Great Britain were then organized in brigades, 3 brigades might be formed, but they also would be far below establishment, both generally and by trades. These brigades would not be mobile, as there would be a great deficiency of mechanical transport personnel.   They would also be without field ambulances.2. The recruiting position is as follows : 183,000 men have been taken from the recruiting market in about 18 months, and consequently the Peace Establishment as proposed in this year&apos;s estimate, amounting to about 1,500 men per 2 battalion regiment has nearly been reached. If, then, this establishment is adhered to recruiting must be drastically checked at an early date.After allowing for run off and wastage only 11,000 recruits can be financially authorized for the remainder of this financial year that is, an average of about 1,000 men per month, if spread evenly over the remaining months, as opposed to present monthly average intake of about 5,000.When the estimates were prepared it was proposed to proceed immediately with the enlistment of 80,000 men for the Army Reserve, and it was also hoped that our commitments in Ireland and abroad would be &apos; considerably reduced. Enlistment for he Army Reserve has not yet commenced, and the calls upon us for Ireland and o broad have increased rather than decreased.    It would, therefore, appear to be
III.-NOTES BY THE QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL.11th June, 1920.1. Serious as is the position disclosed in the General Staff memorandum, I fear that as regards the administrative services, and in particular the Royal Army Service Corps, it is even worse.As will be readily appreciated nowadays more than ever, an army which has not adequate administrative troops, or transport for, movement of stores and personnel is useless for fighting purpose.Briefly the position is as follows : i.-Royal A.rmy Service Corps.2. (a.) Even with the permanent Peace Establishments jas put forward in this years Estimates, and if conditions were normal, in order to mobilize 6 divisions and a cavalry division we require 14,000 reservists. We now have, less than 4,000, and this number will under present conditions not be materially increased for 5 or 6 years. It must be remembered that the bulk of the administrative troops are technical and require from 6 months to 2 years&apos; training to be of any value.(b.) Conditions are not normal. In the United Kingdom, Ireland is even now absorbing 162 officers and 2,472 other ranks, and this total will increase when outstanding demands for mechanical transport are fulfilled. The normal Peace Establishment for Ireland is 80 officers and 1,343 other ranks.Then in addition there are the liabilities abroad which are dealt with below.(c.) Pressure is being exercised in the direction of cutting down the peace establishment put forward for the Royal Army Service Corps, The reduction proposed can only be carried out if the Mesopotamian force is reduced to a normal basis. This appears now to be impossible for some time, but, nevertheless, sanction has not been given to completion up to the proposed peace establishment.   The result is that theimperative that the strength of all units at home should be maintained at a considerably higher establishment than that fixed by the estimates, and that the Army Reserve should be replenished by transferring men prematurely from the Colours.It is a maxim from a recruiting point of view never to close recruiting entirely for any particular corps as experience shows that once recruiting is closed it is difficult to get the stream of recruits flowing again.Steps have already been taken to limit the flow by imposing educational tests, raising the standard, and seeking quality in preference to quantity, but as men may be wanted in increasing numbers in the near future and in the absence of an Army Reserve, it is essential to maintain for the present a high peace establishment, control recruiting by careful safeguards without any sudden check, limit establishments by premature transfer to the Reserve, and in addition encourage the enlistment of men who have seen service during the war, so that they may leaven the extreme youth of existing battalions.The above is the state of affairs lor infantry.As regards cavalry, generally speaking we are over strength and recruiting for this -arm of the Service, other than Dragoon Guards, has been stopped.As regards artillery, we are over strength in Horse and Field and recruiting has been strictly limited by an educational test, but we are slightly under strength in Garrison Artillery.As regards Royal Engineers, there is a very serious shortage, more especially in technical trades. As regards Signal Service, there is a deficit of over 5,000 on an establishment of 8,500. As regards the Royal Army Service Corps and the non-combatant services a similar deficiency exists.If the average peace strength of 198,150, as fixed by the Estimates, is to be maintained, technical corps, which are essential to the Army, will have to suffer, owing to the over strength in infantry and cavalry, unless men are discharged from those arms, and to do so would reduce the strength of units to such an extent as to make them practically valueless.To sum up, it is urgently necessary to increase the average strength of 198,150 men for which money has been taken, to recruit large numbers of men for the Army Reserve, and to devise some means of attracting tradesmen to the Colours, if the Army is to be converted into an efficient fighting force.
opportunity of getting experienced mechanical transport officers will soon be lost and we shall soon not be able to complete, except by taking in untrained officers a much more expensive and a wholly unsatisfactory course at the present juncture.(d.) It is only possible to carry on at all by employing temporary officers, of whom there are 1,642, and by the employment in the United Kingdom of civilians. These temporary officers cover liabilities in the Rhine, North Persia, the Black Sea, Plebiscite areas and additional requirements for Egypt and Palestine and for Mesopotamia over and above &quot; normal&quot; requirements. s ,)The existing arrangements by which these liabilities are met are becoming more and more difficult. Temporary officers are pressing to be demobilized or to be made permanent. If the interim liabilities have not commenced to disappear by October, 1920, it will be necessary to make permanent appointments up to 50 per cent, of these liabilities in order that the machine may not break down.(e.) Troops cannot be kept in unhealthy stations beyond the normal period when they ought to be relieved. The provision in Peace Establishments for drafts of Eoyal Army Service Corps to India has been fixed at 7 per cent, instead of 25 per cent., which was considered before the war as the safe minimum. This 7 per cent, may have,, therefore, to be increased.3. The Eoyal Army Servioe Corps establishment is constantly being called upon to supply personnel such as clerks, drivers and mechanics for various missions (mainly Foreign Office).   These in the aggregate make an appreciable drain upon our resources.4. Our resources in mechanical transport in the United Kingdom barely suffice to meet the needs of the troops. In the case of industrial unrest arising, we should not be in a position to provide for the maintenance of detachments made from present stations, while transport of troops by lorry would be completely beyond our powers.5. It must also be borne in mind that the employment of civilian drivers and. artificers is more expensive than the same service by military personnel, while the same is equally true of other services, such as clerks, &amp;c.The danger of dearth of artificers was pointed out in January, 1920, and a scheme of bounties proposed. This was refused on financial grounds. We are forced to employ civilians and still our mechanical transport is hampered, particularly in Ireland, where civilians cannot be employed generally, by lack of artificers.The deficit is now 800 and in September will be 1,050 on our permanent establishments. The maintenance of mechanical transport without sufficient mechanics is extravagant and obviously dangerous.II. Eoyal Army Ordnance Corps.6. The conditions outlined above in connection with Eoyal Army Service Corps in regard to the non-completion of the proposed peace establishments, affect equally the Eoyal Army Ordnance Corps. If the Eoyal Army Ordnance Corps Establishment as put forward is reduced say by 25 per cent., then the 1st and 2nd Divisions and the cavalry divisions of the Expeditionary Force could not take the field for 24 days instead of 10 days as proposed ; the 3rd and 4th Divisions could not take the field for 11 weeks instead of 3 weeks and the 5th and 6th Divisions for 18 weeks instead of 6 weeks.Further, unless civilians are employed to take the place of Eoyal Army Ordnance Corps (an arrangement which is more expensive) the reserves of the regular Expeditionary Force must be cut down to 2 months instead of 6 months laid down by the Mowatt Committee and none of the equipment for Territorials can be held.It is therefore a matter of imperative urgency that the Eoyal Army Ordnance Corps should be brought up to the proposed peace establishment put forward to meet the actual permanent requirements.III. Movements.7. As regards movements, the extension of our liabilities as a result of policy in place of the contraction originally contemplated will, if there is no radical change, result in increased claims on shipping, involving expenditure beyond what was provided, for in the Estimates.
Then our railway liabilities both in personnel and expenditure, for the same reason -will not be able to be curtailed as contemplated.   I give one or two instances: Mesopotamia. The continuance of our liabilities will delay the abolition of the Inland Water Transport organization in Mesopotamia.Black Sea. The policy adopted has made it necessary to maintain the Anatolian Railway with military personnel, and this will continue until we restrict&apos;our commitments in Turkey. &apos;   1General8. I would strongly urge the reduction of our liabilities, and completion at the earliest moment of the establishment proposed in Estimates for the services dealt with above.9. One further point requires emphasis. The whole life blood of a force in the field, however small, depends upon its lines of communication. These consist largely of mechanical transport, and there must be also the necessary ordnance and supply dep6ts and personnel both in the local theatre and at home. The personnel for these services are large!y technical and must be trained from a minimum of 6 months to a maximum of 2 or 3 years in the case of artificers. They cannot be extemporized or drawn from the civilian market except in a world war. To talk of a force for mobilization for which there is no lines of communication is therefore a contradiction in terms.This is equally the case if the force is required to meet industrial disturbance at. home.   Adequate mechanical transport enlarges the possibility of action.   Inadequate mechanical transport cripples the troops and may entirely paralyse their effectiveness. Adequate mechanical transport with the necessary military personnel is therefore from every point of view a valuable insurance.10. The above essential factors must be kept in view when any new commitments are in contemplation. The problem is not merely what troops are available, but how they are to be fed and supplied continuously while they remain in the proposed theatre, and the difficulties and strain of this varv. For instance, it takes many more administrative troops to cope with a force in North Persia than it would if the same troops were located at the end of safe railway communication.11. Finally, it must be recognized that the belief that saving in expenditure can be attained by limiting administrative services is illusory. It has proved unsound often in the past. But with the recent developments in military machinery, arms, transport and equipment, the effectiveness and in fact the existence of a force is more dependent on adequate administrative troops than ever before.Further, just as in 1914 administrative troops were more numerous and important than in 1814, so these troops in view of the developments in the recent war must be more numerous for the future than they were in 1914.To ignore these elemental facts and count only bayonets and sabres is as absurd as it would be to arm your troops to-day with bows and arrows.11th June, 1920.
This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.SECRET.THE CABINET.BRITISH MILITARY LIABILITIES,MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith a note by the Chief of the Air Staff on the General Staff memorandum on British Military Liabilities.W. S. C.The War Office,loth June, 1920.Secretary of State.With reference to the War Office Memorandum on British Military Liabilities, I entirely agree with the remarks of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and forward for your information a similar memorandum by the Air Staff, with the hope it may assist the Cabinet to realize the gravity of the situation.An Appendix to this paper dealing with the possibilities of raising these extra squadrons and showing the cost involved is still under consideration.I must emphasize the fact that the strength of the Royal Air Force as a whole was fixed as the minimum necessary for normal conditions ; it is already well below our requirements to meet existing liabilities, and still more so to deal with a further unfavourable development in even one theatre of operations.H. Trenchard,Chief of the Air Staff.Uth June, 1920.AIR STAFF MEMORANDUM ON THE WORLD SITUATION, MAY, 1920, AND THE IMMEDIATE NEED FOR AN AIR FORCE RESERVE.1. At the time when the Air Force estimates for 1920 were in preparation, the Air Ministry were instructed that two main considerations should guide their proposals : (a.) That an era of peace might be looked forward to undisturbed by other thanminor operations, which are endemic to the frontiers of the Empire. (b.) That economy was a vital necessity.In accordance with these principles the Air Staff put forward an estimate of the minimum number of units required to carry out a strictly conservative policy.2. The necessity for economy remains unchanged, but the peaceful conditions hoped for have been far from realized. So great a portion of the world has been pervaded by the spirit of unrest, and so largely have the commitments of the Empire been increased by the results of the war, that a reconsideration of the Air Forces required must undoubtedly be made.3. In Europe.(a.) The Royal Navy has been in constant operations in the Black Sea and the Royal Air Force in the Mediterranean has been hard put to it to keep pace with Naval requirements.(6.) The lack of air units has been felt in our relations with Turkey and applications for aerial assistance to our military forces made by the General Officer Commanding,
Constantinople, have had to be refused, not because we do not agree that air units are very necessary but because we cannot provide them. In the event of serious trouble over the terms of the Peace Treaty this request is bound to be renewed.(c.) The possibility of trouble in&apos;the Gulf of Finland has been represented by the Admiralty, and though the Air Forces required to co-operate with the Navy in that area can be supplied, it can only be at the expense of the practice and training requirements in Fleet exercises, which will undoubtedly seriously effect the future. This is an instance of that class of Naval operations in which a shore aerodrome will be utilized, and,-, therefore, if we had squadrons in general reserve, they could perform the double role of reinforcements for Naval as well as Military requirements.(d.) The War Office have intimated that extra aerial assistance may be required in Ireland.   Should extra squadrons be required none are available.(e.) From the Army of Occupation in Germany enquiry was recently made as to the aerial reinforcements which would be available in the event of a collision with the German Militarist Party. No possibility of increasing our strength in that area presents itself; in fact no provision was made for the maintenance of the single squadron now stationed on the Ehine, which with its stores and repair unit is almost the equivalent in personnel of two squadrons.4. In Egypt, Palestine and Arabia.(a.) The situation in Palestine is threatening, and though the focus of the trouble has been largely in the French area, the Royal Air Force has been engaged with considerable raiding forces. The attitude of Emir Feisal is still uncertain, and the dissatisfaction of the Arabd at the partition of Syria into two spheres of influence may be increased by the establishment of a Jewish State.The strength of the Royal Air Force in Palestine is not more than sufficient to deal with raids, and would have to be increased if serious operations are contemplated.(b.) The only reserve for Palestine, as for the Middle East and India generally, is Egypt. At the moment unrest appears to be less than a few months ago, but it is thought the War Office would be unwilling to release air units from Egypt, which are the minimum at present considered necessary until the situation is more defined. The reduction of the military garrison of the country will increase this feeling.(c.) In the Soudan the Royal Air Force has been engaged in minor operations; the situation in that country is unknown, and no information is obtainable as to whether further operations are contemplated.(d.) The neighbourhood of Aden is subject to periodic outbreaks of unrest; the boundary of the leased territory has been infringed and an aerial detachment demanded. It has been found impossible to find an Air Force unit for this station, though a small demonstration was arranged at Hodeida which effected the release of Colonel Jacob&apos;s Mission. The situation in south-east Arabia may well become acute and the demand for aeroplanes renewed. -5. Mesopotamia area.(a.) This area is at present a storm centre, Arab, Turk and Bolshevik intrigues combine to render our position one of the utmost difficulty. The present establishment of three squadrons of the Air Force which it is intended to maintain in Mesopotamia is the minimum necessary&apos; to maintain internal order and resist minor attacks from without. Should the situation develop seriously against us and a concerted attack by strong forces be made against our position in the country, our aerial forces must be increased. Apart from this contingency no provision is allowed for forces outside the forces of Mesopotamia, e.g., in south-west or north-west Persia, these are at present detached from the forces allotted Mesopotamia proper with the result that our air units. in that country are below the minimum strength necessary to preserve order. If our national policy is to continue to maintain forces in Persia, Mesopotamia requires immediate reinforcement.(6.) But Persia presents other problems, not only has the provision of detachments in north-west and south-west Persia resulted in a dangerous weakening of our Air Force in Mesopotamia, but these detachments are of themselves likely to prove insufficient and may have to be increased. The threat of a Bolshevik advance from Enzeli had already led to a demand for reinforcement of the air unit at Kasvin, but it is doubtful whether General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, will have consented to a further weakening of the force at his disposal. In the neighbourhood of Bushire again conditions approach aliarchy.   The reduction of one military garrison
Air Staff.to a pre-war scale has entailed the temporary retention of the air detachment at this place, and should the withdrawal of troops further unsettle the country we will be faced with a demand for the strengthening of our Air Forces in this region. Finally, lack of an available unit has compelled us to refuse a request of the Persian Government for an Air Force detachment for police work and the maintenance of the North-West Frontier.6. India. .The establishment of the Air Force in India is only the absolute minimum for normal purposes, but in the event of a war with Afghanistan the Indian Government have intimated that they will demand aerial reinforcements up to five squadrons. These cannot be found from Egypt and there are no other reserves which can be drawn upon.7. It will be seen from the above review that the possible calls on the services of the Air Force are numerous, while no reserve whatever exists to meet the demands. The provision for &quot; striking force &quot; squadrons for the year 1920-1921- is two squadrons and these are both absorbed in Ireland. One squadron in excess of this establishment is maintained with the Army of Occupation of the Rhine. It is impossible to call in any units to form a central reserve, for even in countries where the Air Force has been described as adequate (e.g., Mesopotamia), the facts are to this extent understated in that the situation has resulted in a policy of dispersal in small detachments with the worst results on the efficiency of the units stationed therein. Thus it has come about that both internally in each area and also considered as a whole the Air Force is working at breaking strain. The Air Staff is convinced that this strain can be no longer sustained and that it is essential to make some immediate provision for reserve units to meet a threatened break from unrest into active hostility.8. It is suggested therefore that a minimum Royal Air Force Reserve be immediately sanctioned of five squadrons. These would be formed and stationed at Home in the first instance since packing facilities are at their best in England, and shipping is easiest to obtain in Home ports ; later, when the aerial route from Cairo.to Karachi is working satisfactorily, two squadrons would be stationed in Egypt, where the personnel would be acclimatized, and Whence the squadrons could be transferred by air to reinforce a threatened point. The squadrons maintained at Home will remain as a potential reinforcement for naval as much as for military purposes, since many operations in which the Navy is concerned may, as in the Baltic, involve the employment of machines operating from shore bases.A simultaneous increase in the park and depot establishments in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and (with the sanction of the Indian Government) in India, is strongly recommended. These increases will be necessary to ensure the rapid erection or overhaul of the reserve squadrons on arrival and their maintenance during ensuing operations. Prior to the arrival of reinforcements these increased establishments will be of economic value in keeping the squadrons normally in the country constantly at full strength, and in repairing machines which would otherwise be a total loss, as involving reconstruction beyond the capacity of existing establishments.9. In conclusion, the Air Staff desire to emphasize the seriousness of the problem with which they are faced and the necessity for an early decision. If improvement is desired in the situation abroad during the winter of 1920-1921, it is of the utmost urgency that preparation should be put in hand at once. If this cannot be done, it is impossible to guarantee that the Air Force will be in a position to meet the calls which are likely to be made upon it.
