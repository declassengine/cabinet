i sub: lit the following for the consideration of the Cabinet,IB&apos; KACFFJRSOtf,10th June. 1920.VOCATIONAL TRAD&apos;iX&apos;-G OF 1703EN.I wish! to support the proposal in the Eemorandum (CP.1367) by the I inlster of Labour that the arrangements for the training of women who are leaving Government employment   should be continued at least to the end of the present year.The position at the Ministry of Pensions shov/s clearly the necessity for continuing the arrangements, We have recently demobilised, or given notice to, some 800 women, but the period between demobilisation and the 50th of June is too   short to enable them to receive the benefit of the Training scheme,Further reductions in the female staff may be expected in the near future, but it nay be necessary to retain them temporarily to meet additional work. If temporary retention proves to be necessary, this in my opinion will strengthen the case for affording them opportunities for training which will not be available if the present arrangements are terminated at the end of this month.I strongly urge that the Cabinet should agree to thu pro-co sal of the Finis ter of Labour,1.1.1.10th&apos; June, 1920.
