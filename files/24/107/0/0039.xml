\D       (J1. The proposals in this draft Bill so far as they relate to the health of the workers in mines appear to meto be open to objection.As I pointed out in my Memorandum of 19.3.1920 (CP.922), upon the scheme outlined in C.P.604 for the setting up of a Ministry of Mines, miners&apos; diseases, strictly so called, such as Miners Phthisis and Miners Nystagmus, are at ^resent under the Home Office.     The general care of the health of the miner, as of the rest of the population, namely^ sanitation, housing, infectious diseases, tuberculosis, V.D., insurance and medical practice are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health,     I said in my Memorandum that the question might arise whether the functions of the Home Office in regard to industrial diseases might not ultimately be transferable to the Ministry of Health, it being the settled policy of the Government to concentrate in the Ministry of Health all health functions;   but that I could not conceive on what principle it shaslXfoe proposed that any health functions ahould be allotted to a new Ministry of Mines,thereby creating yet another Medical Department, contrary to the whole principle of the Government&apos;s policy underlying the creation of the Ministry of Health.the draft Bill that all the powers of the Home Secretary in relation to mines should be   transferred to the Secretary of Mines, and by sub-clause (5) that the Secretary of Mines shall undertake the initiation and direction of researchIt is proposed by sub-clause (2) of Clause 1 of with/
with a view to improving the health of the workers. Clause 14 proposes that the Secretary of Sines may give directions requiring compliance with any recommenda-tions of or schemes approved by the National Board, in matters relating, inter alia, to the health of the workers.    These proposals are, I submit, opposed to the settled policy of the Government to concentrate all health functions in the Ministry of Health, and I fear they would be likely to lead to a disintegration rather than concentration of the public health work of the State.If the proposals are accepted, I regard it as essential that provision should be inserted in the Bill requiring that the Minister of Health should be consulted upon any proposed action by the Secretary of Mines which relates to the health of mine workers.2.    The proposal in Clause 20 (3) of the draft Bill that one member of the Committee to be constituted under the Clause shall be appointed by the General Medical Council after consultation with the Minister of Health and the Board of Health for Scotland would put the General &quot;Medical Council in the position of deciding between two Government Departments.     I think it would be preferable that the appointment should be vested in the Minister of Health after conscitation with the Board of Health for Scotland.    The representative of the medical profession on the Advisory Committee for which provision is made by clause 4(2) of the draft might be nominated by the General Jite die al Council.Ministry of Health.C ADDISOK. 10. 6. 20.
