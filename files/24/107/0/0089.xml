This was particularly noticeable at Irkutsk, the town at which the seat of the Omsk Govern-ment had been transferred, although the Dictator had not at that time arrived.   &quot;This-restlessness was well known to the Government authorities, although nothing was done in the way of propaganda to quieten the people. The only action taken was to imprison many people (in many cases on frivolous charges), which naturally had the effect of embittering the Social Revolutionary party more than ever.At this time, as is well known, the armies of Koltchak had been defeated and were in full flight towards the east, and the railway between Tatarskaya and Taiga was in a state of complete disorganization, principally on account of the enormous number of echelons held up between these places, owing to the lack of fuel and engines, and also because the subordinate staff of the railway in many cases were not working whole-heartedly. This was undoubtedly due to the Social Revolutionary influence which had for its main weapon the fact that the workers had not received their full pay for months, and owing to the recent defeat of the armies and the disorderly flight which was then taking place, and which the railway workers were in a position to witness better than anybody else, the chances of obtaining it, however hard they worked, appeared to be nil. - &quot; &apos;Although many desertions were taking place daily during the retreat, I understand that the first time Social Revolutionary influence was displayed the troops was at Tomsk and Taiga, where the soldiers of the 12th and 46th Regiments shot most of their officers, and describing themselves as Social Revolutionaries made it public that they would retreat no further, but wait for the regular Soviet army and make peace with them.By this time Admiral Koltchak and his staff had passed Krasnoyarsk, and this town had been occupied by the adherents of Schetenkin, the leader of the Revolutionary party which had for some months been operating in the Achinsk Minusinsk district and had previous to this captured Achinsk.At Nijne Udisk, the local Revolutionaries had overthrown the Koltchak administration and by the time Admiral Koltchak arrived, a new form of government was in existence. It was at this station that the question arose as to whether the Dictator should be able to proceed further east, or should be handed over to the Government which had overthrown his in that district. Naturally, much excitement was caused locally on his arrival, but no attempt by force was made to arrest- him for(B20/286)   10U  6/20  h&amp;s  8322wo
two reasons, viz., firstly, because he had a strong guard with him which may have resisted any attempt and thus caused bloodshed, and, secondly, the Czechs, who were also in the station, would not have allowed fighting to take place there, and the Czech commander evidently thought that to some extent he was responsible for the Dictators safety as he also placed guards on the Koltchak echelons. The Government, however, presented certain demands to the Czech commander, one of which was,, Admiral Koltchak should be handed over to them for disposal. These demands were reported by wire to Czech headquarters at Irkutsk on 31st December, 1919.In the meantime the Revolution had spread east, and 31st December found Cheremkhova occupied by the Social Revolutionaries and Irkutsk in the critical stages of a struggle which had already been in progress for over a week.The Allied High Commissioners were at Irkutsk at&apos; the time the report of the Czech commander at Nijne Udinsk was received, and the matter was referred to them. After conferring together they decided that if the Dictator sought Allied protection for his personal safety, this protection must be given, and on the matter being referred to the commander of the Allied forces, General Janin, he concurred in their decision.The Czech commander at Nijne Udinsk was instructed that in the event of Admiral Koltchak seeking Allied protection, he was to despatch him and his entourage to Irkutsk in a wagon under Allied flags and furnish sufficient protection to ensure his safe arrival.On the 4th January, 1920, a telegram from Admiral Koltchak was received by the High Commissioners, in which he stated that he had decided to hand over the supreme power of the whole of Russia to the Oommander-in-Chief of the armed forces in South Russia, Lieut.-General Denikin, and that an Act to this effect would be signed by him on his arrival at Verkhne Udinsk, and considering the necessity of issuing this Act as soon as possible, asked for orders to expedite the movement of his train to the Trans-Baikal, together with all their personnel, under guard of the Allied Powers. The action taken by the High Commissioners on this telegram was to instruct the Czech headquarters to ensure the carrying out of the instructions already issued to the Czech commander at Nijne Udinsk.Admiral Koltchak was informed by wire of the Allied High Commissioners&apos; decision regarding his personal safety, but in a telegram sent by General Zamkavitch, dated 5th January, 19^0, to the Allied High.Commissioners, Czechs, and General Janin, it was stated that orders for the departure of only one wagon of the Admiral had been received and troops and a number of persons were being left to their fate. Admiral Koltchak.had therefore decided that he could not for moral motives hand over his subordinates to the mercies of the masses and had decided to share their fate, however, terrible it might be. This wire arrived after the departure of the High Commissioners, who had left the previous day, and it could not have been received by them until some days later, so their impression when they left Irkutsk must have been that the Admiral&apos;s safety was assured.On the receipt of this telegram, General Janin, presumably as he was unable to consult with the Allied High Commissioners, and as the situation in the west was daily becoming worse and more acute, and as. the trouble with the Social Governments on the railway west of Irkutsk would still jeopardize the already precarious undertaking of evacuation of the Allied forces, decided that he could accept no further responsibility for the Admirafs safety and therefore told him &quot; that he had done his best and could do no more.&quot;However, the Czechs had acted on the instructions given, and the Admiral and his party were placed in a wagon and escorted to Irkutsk on 9th January. On arrival at Cheremkhova the local Government demanded that the Admiral should be handed over, and threatened to use force if the demand was not acceded to, but the train eventually left without interference. I am informed that the Czech headquarters , also received a similar demand from the Political Centre party at Irkutsk, and they requested General Janin, who was then at Verkhne Udinsk, to issue instructions. General Janiifs instructions were to the effect that Admiral Koltchak should be handed over to the Political Centre party.Mainly owing to the brutal murder of 31 political prisoners who were taken away as hostages by General Cechoff when he retired from Irkutsk, the supporters of the new Government were much incensed against the Koltchak (Omsk) Government, and the expected arrival of Admiral Koltchak was known to every inhabitant of the town two or three days before he actually arrived. On the afternoon of the arrival (loth January, 1920) of the Admirals train it was noticeable that there were many more Social Revolutionary troops than usual in the station, and when the train pulled.
* Two echelons, strength about 1,000.iu, these troops crowded around the carriage in which the Admiral and his party were travelling. The Czech guard which had escorted the party from Nijne Udinsk, withdrew shortly after the train stopped, and Social Revolutionary guards were mounted, who, in addition to being armed with rifles, had bombs attached to their belts, and one sentry carried a bomb in his hand. , On, and in the vicinity of the station, notices had been put up announcing the arrival of the leader of the treacherous Government which had been ruining and oppressing the people for so long, and pointing out to them that every adherent of the people&apos;s cause should consider it their duty to ensue that now he was in their hands, no opportunity should be given him to escape.It was noticeable that many of the officers on whose behalf Koltchak had refused personal safety for himself, did not arrive with him. These men had deserted him at various stages of the journey, and most of them eventually landed at Chita ancl Harbin on Allied echelons, General Zamkavitch among them.I understand that the Japanese, who had forces in the station up to 18th January, sent a letter to General Serovy on the 14th expressing sympathy with Admiral Koltchak, and asking that he be handed over to the Japanese lor safety, but the application was refused presumably, as it must have appeared quite evident to the commander of the Czech forces that the Japanese knew that it could not be done without causing a popular outburst of ill-feeling against the Czechs, which would have spread east and west and eventually cost hundreds of Czech lives, as all the railway and other workers were by this time heart and soul in the new movement, and were ready to go to any extreme to further it. The extreme in this case would undoubtedly have been the destruction of the railway east and west of Irkutsk, which would have meant further serious delay in the Czech evacuation and fighting between the Czechs and strong forces of the regular Soviet forces, and possibly against the forces of the various local Governments on the line of retreat.Also it must have appeared quite evident that this application was merely put forward by the Japanese at the last moment, knowing that it would be refused, but with a view to clearing themselves of any responsibility connected with the handing over of the Admiral. Had they seriously contemplated safeguarding him they would have offered to do so when the Allied High Commissioners were at Irkutsk earlier in the month.The Social Revolutionary Committee lost no time in removing the Admiral from the train, as he was taken away under strong escort and placed in the Irkutsk district prison on the night of his arrival.During the night of the 18th January the remainder^ of the Japanese forces, which had arrived on 1st January, left Irkutsk&apos; without any warning, their engines having been kept under steam and attached to their echelons for practically the whole time since their arrival. The consensus of opinion of the Social Revolutionists on the departure of the Japanese appeared to be one of relief, as it was not understood why they had remained at Irkutsk, and the feeling against them was very bitter. It was also thought that they were supporting Semionon, and might be transformed into an advance guard of forces which it was rumoured were advancing from Trans-Baikal.The Political Centre party (Social Revolutionary Government at Irkutsk) handed over their powers to the Irkutsk Revolutionary Committee of the Russian Soviet Federal Socialistic Republic on the evening of the 21st January, 1920, and, with the exception of Hornstein, who remained in charge of the Foreign Department (he had in his charge all documents, &amp;c, of the Omsk Government Foreign Office), all officials were replaced.Commissar Shiriamoff took over the office of President, with Commissar Oborin as his Manager of Affairs. Kalashnikoff, who had been commander of the forces in the Irkutsk district, and who had been mainly instrumental in making the recent local revolution a success, was replaced by Zvereff.On the 26th January the Military Revolutionary Committee paid a visit * to Koltchak and his Minister, Pepelaieff, who were then in the district prison. The Committee stated that Koltchak was noticeably thinner, and appeared to be very worried. Pepelaieff, however, was fairly cheerful. On being asked about repressions, both stated that no repressions had taken place.     1On the 27th January it was published in the &quot;News of the Irkutsk Military Revolutionary Committee &quot; (the Soviet official paper), that the Extraordinary Investiga-tion Committee of the Irkutsk Military Revolutionary Committee was urgently-collecting information and material that had any bearing on the activities of Admiral
Koltchak or his Minister, Pepelaieff, in order to commit them for trial. The Committee commenced work on the 20th, but it was not until 2nd February that a list of the questions to be put to Koltchak appeared in the paper. A copy of this list is attached (Appendix B).It was stated about this time that Japan had sent to the Military Revolutionary Committee demanding that a Japanese guard should be placed on the train containing the Russian gold reserve. This demand was refused. (The gold had been brought from Nijne Udinsk at the same time as Koltchak, and was then at Irkutsk Station under a mixed guard of Czechs and Russians.) &quot; .   ;I was informed that a large quantity of military decorations, gold and silver, also a valuable sword presented by the Japanese, was found on the Admiral&apos;s train, and confiscated.The official paper of 28th January published Order No. 2 of the Irkutsk Military Revolutionary Committee, dated 22nd January, 1920, in which was announced the abolition of the &quot;Death Sentence,&quot; and an offer made to all adherents of Admiral Koltchak to lay down their arms and surrender immediately.   (See Appendix A.)For some days previous to the 29th, conflicting rumours had been in circulation in town regarding General Kappel&apos;s army, which it was known had occupied Nijne Udiusk, but it was not until 29th January that definite information came to hand that his advance guard had arrived at Zema. On this date the town of Irkutsk and it&apos;s surroundings were declared to be under martial law.Also on 29th January it became known that an armistice arranged between the Czechs and the vanguard of the Soviet regular army near Taishet had been broken off. I learned from the Czech representative that their forces had blown up the water tower at Taishet and destroyed the railway and bridges near that depSt, owing to the fact that it was discovered that the Bolsheviks were attempting an encircling movement after agreeing to cease hostilities and remain 50 versts behind the Czech rear guards.On the morning of 31st January I was visited by Hornstein, Foreign Commissar of the Irkutsk Military Revolutionary Committee. He informed me that the Soviet troops sent from Irkutsk to oppose the advance of Kappefs army, had been disarmed by the Czechs on arrival at Zema, and this, combined with the news that hostilities , between the regular Soviet army and the Czechs had been resumed, was causing great anxiety at Irkutsk in regard to the action the Czechs would take if Kappefs forces -attempted to capture the town of Irkutsk. He said that there were still sufficient troops in and near the town to put up a strong fight against Kappel, but as fighting-would cause much unnecessary bloodshed, especially among the civilian population, he had been sent by the Military Revolutionary Committee to ask me to use any influence possible with the Czechs, in order to arrange negotiations with Kappel with a view to cessation of hostilities and Kappels army proceeding east without entering the town. He also pointed out that many important political prisoners, including&apos;Koltchak, were, in their hands, and who, in spite of the recent Baikal outrage, had up to that time not been harmed, but who would undoubtedly suffer if matters went against the Irkutsk Soviet. In addition, the whole of the railway for a considerable distance east and west of Irkutsk, and the Baikal tunnels, would be destroyed, as the sympathies of the workers and peasant were with the present government.At a conference consisting of General Syrovy, commander of the Czech forces in Siberia, Dr. Blargosh, representative of the Czecho-Slovak Republic, and myself held on the evening of 31st January, it was decided to inform Kappels successor, General Voitsekovski, of current events in Vladivostock and the east generally, and suggest that further bloodshed might be avoided by coming to an agreement. This decision was acted upon that night (see Appendix C) and resulted in proposals (see Appendix D) being sent by Voitsekovski. These proposals were received on the night of 1st /February and were submitted to the Revolutionary Committee at 2 a.m. on 2nd February.I was informed by the Czechs that the reason for disarming the Soviet troops at Zema was owing to their echelons blocking the line to the east, and causing a temporary suspension of the Czech evacuation.On the 1st February pamphlets were distributed in the town, and the official paper contained a warning to the population that any attempt to reintroduce the regime of General Cechoff would result in a change of attitude towards prisoners and reactionary elements of the town.   A copy of this warning is attached (Appendix E).The proposals sent by Voitsekovski were not accepted, and although all war material, foodstuffs and valuables were being hastily evacuated to the woods south of Irkutsk the local government had decided to defend the town.   &quot; Siege Law &quot; came
into force from the 2nd February. The River Angora, which was then frozen over, was mined in many places, trenches dug on the outskirts of the town, and streets in the centre of the town were strongly bairicaded. The population at this time was very excited, as were also, in my,opinion, the members of the Revolutionary Committee.On 3rd February the Military Revolutionary Committee passed a resolution for the formation of a Military Revolutionary Tribunal (prdcis of this resolution will be found at Appendix F of this report), and on the same day passed a resolution empowering the Extraordinary Investigation Committee to apply the highest punishment   death sentence - during periods of a counter-revolutionary armed insurrection.   (See Appendix G.) ;,;On the afternoon of the 7th February, 1920, a special official bulletin was published announcing that Admiral Koltchak and his Prime Minister, Pepelaieff, had been executed, by shooting, at 5 a.m. that morning.The whole matter had been kept secret, with the idea, I think, of impressing the masses in a sudden and unexpected manner of the power of the Revolutionary Committee. Immediately on. hearing the news I proceeded to the headquarters of the Revolutionary Committee and, in an interview with the President and the Manager of Affairs, on asking to be informed whether the reported news of Admiral Koltchak&apos;s execution was correct, I received an answer in the affirmative. I also asked why news of the intended execution had not received publicity and why it had been carried out so suddenly, as I considered that the Admiral and his Prime Minister could not have received by that time a full or fair trial. The answer given to this was : &quot; Owing to the discovery of a plot to start a counter-revolution in the town and release the Admiral, also on account of the nearness of Voitsekovski, one of whose terms for not-entering the town being that &apos; Admiral Koltchnk and his party should receive their freedom,&apos; it was decided at a special meeting of the Revolutionary Committee held at 2 a.in. that morning that rather than run a risk of allowing Koltchak and Pepelaieff to escape punishment they so well merited, further ceremony would be dispensed with and their execution would be carried out forthwith. Accordingly the Committee decreed that both should be shot immediately, and this decree was carried out at 5 a.m. on the same day.&apos;&apos;I asked that I should be furnished with documentary confirmation of the Admirals death. This I received and attach hereto the English translation (Appendix H). It was rumoured in town among the sympathisers of the late Admiral that he had been murdered in his cell. On the 9th February, in another interview with the President of the Revolutionary Committee, I asked how the execution had been carried out, and was informed that it had been done in the proper military form by a squad of soldiers. This statement I have no reason to doubt, especially as I was informed by an agent employed in the headquarters of the Military Revolutionary Committee that during a conversation overheard between one of the witnesses and a member of the Committee, it was remarked that &quot; Koltchak had died very bravely, but Pepelaieff had broken down at the last moment.&quot;From a reliable source I received information that a member of an officers&apos; organization, which had been secretly formed for the purpose of rescuing Koltchak, had, through bribery, gained access to his Excellency and informed him of the plan to release. The Admiral, however, said &quot; he would rather undergo whatever was before him than to attempt to escape at the expense of the lives of many of his adherents.&quot;The execution was undoubtedly precipitated mainly by the rapid advance of Voitsekovski, as it was probably thought that if Koltchak was executed there would be no reason for the former to risk the danger of a- strong engagement by attempting to take the town, especially as it was known that the Czechs and Regular Soviets had arranged another armistice, and that the gold reserve (the only other reason for which Voitsekovski would come to the town) was in the hands of the Czechs who were relying upon it to help them make favourable terms with the Regular Soviets.Had it not been for this, and in spite of the talk of a counter-revolution, I am convinced that the trial which was intended should be carried out, would have taken place, and eventually the Admiral would have been sent to Moscow for further trial.When he was handed over it was a question of Admiral Koltchak&apos;s safety or&apos; the safety of thousands of Czech lives and, I think, taking into consideration the attitude of the Czechs at that time and since, at Irkutsk and west of that town, had General Janin not decided that the Admiral should be handed over to the Political Centre party, the Czechs would have handed him over on their own initiative; as they were well aware of their own position and their sympathies were undoubtedly with the Social Revolutionists.
GORDER NO. 2 BY IRKUTSK MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE, 22nd JANUARY, ddii).The iIrkutsk Military Revolutionary Committee offers to all units and individuals of the army of Admiral Koltchak who remain in the districts of the activity of the Revolutionary Committee to lay down their arms and surrender themselves to the Soviet Government wherever they may be at present, as future resistance against the Soviet Government is useless and without reason, and will only lead to their eventual destruction by the Soviet troops approaching from the west or by the troops of the Revolutionary Committee. ;,;At the same time the Revolutionary Committee announces the decision reached by the Soviet of Commissaires of the Soviet Republic to abolish the most severe punishment to the enemies of the people -shooting and thus, the immediate and complete surrender of the units and individuals referred to above will guarantee them that they, when their affairs are being investigated by the Court of the Republic, will retain their lives.A.

General Voitsekovski, having taken over command of the anti-Bolshevik forces after the death of General Kapel.Captain Stilling and Dr. BlargosL-llow do you do, General ? We wish to inform you of the events taking place in the East, where all the line from Pogranichnaya to Vladivostock (included) is in the hands of Revolutionary Committees. The attitude of the Japanese and in general of the Allies is neutral and, therefore, they are not interfering in the struggle. The power of the Revolutionary Committees is spreading further also, and in the direction of Habarovsk and the whole of the Trans-Baikal the country is in flames of revolt. Only in Chita is still the power of Attaman Semionoff and he has a few troops in Verkniuclinsk. This power, however, is only temporary, as it is perfectly obvious that it cannot last.In view of the facts given&apos; in the foregoing, we consider that further bloodshed is useless, and we therefore ask you, General, would you not wish to begin negotiations with the Local Soviet Committee with the idea of your armies passing to the East without entering the town of Irkutsk and thereby preventing much more bloodshed ? If you agree to negotiate, please send us your terms as soon as possible, and from our side we will do everything possible to obtain a mutual agreement.We also support General Syrovy in his request that troops of the Irkutsk Revolutionary Committee, disarmed by the Czecho-Slovak forces at Zema and handed over to you. should be returned with their arms to the commander of the III Czecho-SlovakDivision now at Zema. This is necessary to help the general situation.General Voitsekovski. How do you do ? I am very grateful for the information you have given me. The suggestion made by you is such that I alone cannot answer, but I beg that you will accept my reply to-morrow (1st February, 1920) between the hours of 20-22 (Irkutsk time). Troops of the Irkutsk Revolutionary Committee disarmed by the Czechs at station Zema have not been handed over to me. The commander of the III Czecho-Slovak Division intended handing them over but has apparently changed his mind.Captain Stilling. Kindly inform me, General, whether there are any British officers or soldiers with your forces ?1 General Voitsekovski I think not. At least I have not heard of any and if there were I would certainly know.  I have finished.Captain Stilling and Dr. Blargosh. We thank you for your replies and will await you at the apparatus, at the time you have asked.   Good-bye.APPENDIX D.Translation of second conversation on direct line from Irkutsk to Zema, held on 1st February, 1920, in y connection with proposal that anti-Bolshevik forces should not pass through town of Irkutsk en route to the East.At apparatus, Zema. Chief of Staff of Russian anti-Bolshevik Army, General Shtepikin. At apparatus, Irkutsk. Captain  Stilling, British representative, and Dr. Barglosh, Czecho-Slovak representative.Good evening, General.  We ask you what answer you can give from General Voitsekovski? Generol Shtepikin. Good evening.  Owing to a slight illness of General Voitsekovski, I am empowered to transmit to you the following answer: The anti-Bolshevik forces can refuse to pass through Irkutsk only by the fulfilment by the Irkutsk Revolutionary Committee of the following conditions: (1.) The unopposed passing of our armies to the Baikal on all roads outskirting Irkutsk.(2.) An immediate order of the Irkutsk Revolutionary Committee to all authorities and all Regular and irregular Soviet troops in the way of our armies to cease hostilities against us. A copy of this order must be transmitted to me simultaneously with its issue.
APPENDIX E.Warning issued by the Irkutsk Military Revolutionary Committee on Sunday, 1st February, 1920.The Irkutsk&apos; Military Revolutionary Committee which has the support of the masses, and the immense-power of Soviet Russia behind it, and was capable of disorganizing the enemy and even its army, on taking over the Government of the district of Irkutsk, did not consider it necessary to punish the enemies of the-people with &quot; Red Terror &quot; or without mercy.The Committee considers that it is apparent to all, that the formation in Russia and Siberia of a uniform-Government of the Russian Soviet Federal Socialistic Republic is essential, and that nobody should dare to attempt to destroy the Revolutionary order and cause useless bloodshed by an attempt of a counter-revolutionary movement, which is bound to prove a failure. Still, there are madmen who continue to hope for the possibility of the return of the regime of Sechoff even for an hour, madmen, whose work may force the Revolutionary Committee to reconsider its attitude towards the enemies of the people who have surrendered, and the reactionary elements of the town.The Military Revolutionary Committee, being responsible to the masses for the maintenance of revolutionary order, proclaims that it will deal without mercy and adopt every measure of suppression, if the enemy, who has surrendered, attempts to reinstate, even for an hour, the hated bloody tyranny of the old: regime.(3.) Temporarily, until the armies pass the Baikal, cessation of propaganda and slander al: present being spread by different orders and pamphlets by the Revolutionary Committee accusing the armies of cruelty and atrocities against the peaceful population of the country where the armies must pass and have passed.(4.) To supply the armies with money having a good circulation in the East amounting to a total of Rs. 200,000,000. Of this amount 50 millions to be in gold and silver. Of the total amount not less than 100 millions (including 25 millions in gold and silver) must be sent to me at the station of Cherimkova. This money is quite necessary to give to the force the opportunity of purchasing supplies, &amp;c, and thereby not offending the population, and not giving the Revolutionary Committee reason to provocate the armies. ,(5.) To give an unmolested passage east to the Sanitary Train No. 87 of Dr. Koleshnikov, attached to Nesterov&apos;s Group, and which is at present near the station Zema.

Decree No. 27 of the Military Revolutionary Committee of Irkutsk, dated the 7th February, 1920.There have been found by oversearching in many places of the town stores of arms, bombs and machine-gun ribbons, &amp;c, and the mysterious removal in the town of these things (war ammunition), and the, scattering of portraits of Koltchak in the town have been revealed.From another side, General Voitsehovski, answering to the proposal to surrender, in one of the &quot;points of his &quot; Answer&quot; mentions the handing over of Koltchak and his staff. &apos;&quot;;All these data admit that there is in the town a secret organization aiming at the deliverance of one of the grievous criminals against the labour classes-Koltchak and his party. This insurrection is destined to failure, but nevertheless it may be followed by a number of innocent victims and by an explosion of vengeance of the revolted masses, which would not allow the repetition of such an attempt.By duty of preventing these useless sacrifices and of defending the town from the atrocities of civil war, and likewise basing themselves on the data of enquiry and on the decrees of the Council of the Oommissaires of the Russian Soviet Federal Socialistic Republic having declared Koltchak and his Government outlaws, the Military Revolutionary Committee of Irkutsk herewith decrees : (1) The former Supreme Governor, Admiral Koltchak,and(2) The former President of the Council of Ministers, Pepeliaeff,To be Shot.Better is the execution of two criminals a long time worthy of death than hundreds of innocent&apos; victims.(Signed) A.
