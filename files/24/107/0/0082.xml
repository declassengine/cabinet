Oocr/r^nt H the Pioperty cfujeaty&apos;$ Govcitary Secret.1396From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,12th June 1920.(Received 15th, 6.20.) Priority A. No. 740,5.Malmis wires 8th June : &quot; Following information has been given by Engineer Haliutin, a highly intelligent man, who was in charge of section of the Central Asia Railway from Chardjui to Krasnovodsk, including the Kushk branch, until 20th May, when he fled from Askabad : &quot;I. In December and January the original Bolshevik plan was to send 160,000 troops to Turkestan, via Orenburg, and he received orders to provide rolling stock for their transport. He was summoned to Tashkent in April and shown instructions. Immediately the Polish question became serious the plan was abandoned for the time, echelons on their way to Tashkent from Orenburg and war centre troops in Turkestan were recalled. The Bolshevik plan had been (corrupt group) by consideration that (corrupt group) in the West had failed, and that the East was now the centre of revolutionary action. They hoped that, without actual action in India, the mere appearance of this body technically would be sufficient to cause Indian revolution.&quot; 2. The Bolshevik army is now disposed on line of Krasnovodsk-Kushk-Chardjui. The strength cannot be given by him, but when he approached the Director of Supplies about a month ago, to provide rations for railwaymen, he was told by that official that, as he had to provide for 50,000 (? rations) for combatant and non-combatant ranks of the first Army, he could do nothing to help.&quot; 3. He stated that the (? Field) Artillery and heavy guns who passed through to Krasnovodsk at the end of April, and some 1,000 troops were sent to the Caucasus across the Caspian ; also that troops for Ukraine were subsequently despatched that way.&quot;4. About a month ago he was in telegraphic communication with Staff Division at Kizil Arvat. They wished him to undertake the repair of barracks for troops at that place. He was unable to give the strength of the Division, but he was told that the object of keeping troops there was to ward off British attacks on the railway from road to Kizil Arvat from Persia. At Kahka he also saw fortification work beino-carried out with the same object and emphasises that Bolshevik fear of British attack is their main pre-occupation in Turkestan.&quot; 5. Even were this fear removed, he does not think they would invade Persia, but he is convinced of their intention to foment agitation in Persia. He is aware that very large pecuniary allowances are made to Idalat by the Bolsheviks with that object.&quot;
