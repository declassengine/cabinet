THIS DOOUJffilJT is the PROPERTY OP his britahhic majestyfsqjovsru^ehtT&quot;&quot;SECRET.El^randum by the Minister of Transport.The Minister of Labour and his predecessor have called attention In two memoranda (C,p. 806 and CP. 1232) to the present tendency of wages and to the effect which an increase granted in one industry has on the wages In other industries generally.    Thus, quite apart from advances in wages to-meet the Increased cost of living, an Award granting an Increase to the engineering and shipbuilding trades on account of the pros-perity of the industry, and the consequent value of the work performed, Is seized upon by other industries as a reason for claiming a similar increase irrespective of the financial position of their particular industry,Similarly an increased daily wage granted partly on account of the casual nature of the employment, as in the case of the Report of Lord Shawfs Court of Inquiry into the wages and con-ditions of dock workers, is used as an argument for increased wages in other industries where the proportion of casual emp^oy-ment may be negligible, jThe result is a constant tendency for the wages in all industries to be levelled up to the highest paid in any industry,&apos; This is followed by a demand on behalf of the more highly skilled workers for a further increase ad such further increase leads in its turn to renewed demands for a general levelling up.All increased wages granted in other industries have their effect directly or indirectly on the wages of railwPwymen,    Thus the increases granted to the engineering and shipbuilding trades are in the normal course applied by the Industrial Court to men employed/
&apos; j 23Sor.iployoo._in railway shops, and increases granted to dock workers, policemen end others are advanced as arguments for a further inorease in wages to other grades of railway employees, without regard to the financial position of the railway companies.In this connection the Report on the claim  or inoreased wages for Railway employees which 1bs just been published by the national wages Board, consisting of four General Managers, four representatives of the Railway employees, one representative nominated by the Federation of British Industries, one by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, one by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and one by the Co-operative Union under the Chairmanship of Sir Mackenzie, who is also Chairman of the Industrial Court, contains the two following noteworthy paragraphs with which I entirely agree, &quot;*43,      &quot;In publishing their conclusions, the Board express the view that who settlement should not be disturbed for such period as&apos;will facilitate a return to that stability of industry and commerce which is so neoessary to the well-being of the community,    This expression of view is without prejudice to alterations of rates consequential upon changes in the cost of living.&quot;45,      &quot;The Board feel justified in recording their view that the absence of any effective system of co-ordinating changes in rates of wages is largely responsible for the fact that wages1 settlements tend to bo disturbed not because of inherent defects, but because of changes in the comparative level of wages in different trades brought about without due regard to the position outside the industry immediately affected,&quot;My attention has further been called to the effect ofthe present labour situation upon the efficiency of the railways.The following remarks refer more particularly to the LondonBlee&apos;tric Hallways, but apply also to railways generally.    Thecontinual claims by various grades of men for increased wagesand improved conditions of service, together with the almostdaily remest for deputations an?, conferences, take up a. con-siderabls proportion (which is said to amount even to 50 per cent)of/
of the time of the management thus making it impossible to give that attention which might otherwise be given to important problems of development etc.The tendency with trade unions r.t the present&apos;time is to take up any question which either does affect or might possibly effect any individual employee and this is done nowadays even in cpses where it would seem obvious that the mon was in the wrong.     It is understood that responsible union officials have said openly that thoir members are entitled to the support of the union no matter &quot;-hat their actions may have been.The efficiency f-::nd esprit de corps of the employees as a whole are sr.id to be affected by the existing state of things and their belief in the apparently limitless power of their unions is reflected in their resentmant against discipline and control, in a disposition to perform their work as and how they choose, md. in a tendency to discourtesy and indifference to the general public.The loosening of discipline is said to have its effect on the supervisory cIpss and even on higher officials;     this effect being shewn by the fact that unauthorised concessions are being made to the men and important offences on the part of the staff are being either overlooked or inadequately dealt with.    This is probably due firstly to the fact that the foremen class are in many cases members of the same union as thejmen whom they control and secondly that the higher officials are reluctant to take any step which although just and necessary they feel may lead either to a strike or if their decision should be reversed to a diminution of their personal prestige.     In addition to this it is said that officials ^nd the supervisory grades are beginning to feel thrt in view of the large suras repeatedly granted in increased wages without regard to financial stability the only thing for them to do is to join in some phase or other of the trado unions&apos; movement and to share in the spoil themselves,/Similar
- 4 -Similar results exist no doubt to some extent in other industries and the general loss of efficiency which would appear to be the result of the present labour situation would&apos; seem to be a question which required careful consideration unless further deterioration in this respect is to result..Further the present cycle apparently will receive a new impetus by the miners demands.    Then it all starts again.The Cabinet may have noticed that the report of the National Wages Board, Section 43 and quoted on Page 2, hereof, suggests that this present increase should last for some little time, apart from increases on tho co3t of living sliding scale. As showing how the mind of even the steadier labour leader goes, Mr. Thomas drew my attention to this in conversation and said that though he dldnH dare suggest it to the men he thought the wages ought not to be raised agai^, until August, 1921, apart from any cost of living rises brought about by the sliding scale.Again the cost of living standards upon which sliding scales are based are far from perfect and may be quite unjustified-fiably up30t by increases in any one article upon which an undue accent has been placed in the soale.It is difficult to see the remedy,-   Yfagoa Enquiries by Boards, Courts, Councils look at their own case primarily. Thoir findings in fact bind the Government and tkj/e Employer. They do not bind the workers either to accept at all, or if accepted to obtain for any length of time,    I view the present progress as most suicidal,I suggest that an enquiry should be held into it.    Such matters as the basis of the cost of living figures, the length of time for ^hich awards should last and the periodicity of fresh demands, the factors to be held to justify either increase of wage or increase of high cost of living allowance, might all be reviewed with advantage.
Abnormal prosperity of an industry might justify a temporary addition to a wage but should not justify a permanent addition to wages of all members of a union whether working in a prosperous class of business or not.    We are, I fear, piling up a store of trouble, loss of trade and unemployment which the present intoxicated lust for more wages is making more and more ominous as trade slacks off.An enquiry such as I suggest would at least educate the public and tho Chairmen and members of all classes of wage tribunals.    The report of the National Wages Board of which Sir W, Mackenzie is Chairman, in Section 45 quoted on page 2 hereof, reinforces my suggestion of an enquiry.(Signed)       ERIC GEDDES, 15 th June, 1920.
