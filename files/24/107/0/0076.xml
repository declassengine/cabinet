Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.MESOPOTAMIA. ,-Political and Military Situation.I circulate for the information of my colleagues two very important telegrams from Sir Arnold Wilson, to which are prefixed four telegrams recently addressed to * him on the constitutional question.It will be seen that Sir A. Wilson takes a very serious view of the military situation, the dangers of which I am inclined to think he overstates. The War Office will no doubt obtain an authoritative military opinion from the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, but in the meantime His Majesty&apos;s Government should know what are the views of the Civil Commissioner.The evacuation of Deir-es-Zor was agreed to at Deauville, and the re-occupation of the Mutessariflik, which would include Rakka in Mesopotamia, is presumably quite out of the question.With regard to the political situation, since it appears to be impossible to obtain a decision here before the 18th, I have instructed Sir A: Wilson to postpone the announcement. I wish, however, to impress upon my colleagues that until a definite decision is reached and announced, the political situation must be expected to deteriorate.E, S. M.15th June 1920.From Secretary of State to Civil Commissioner, Baghdad,1th June 1920.(Repeated to Viceroy.)Priority A.P. 4216 (1). Your telegram dated 10th May, No. 561.1, and connected corre-spondence.   Constitutional proposals.Following is summary of Draft Mandate as provisionally adopted by His Majesty&apos;s-Government, subject to approval of League of Nations. Preamble constitutes Mesopotamia as an Independent State under guarantee of League of Nations, and confers mandate on Great Britain : Article I.-The Mandatory responsible for maintenance of peace and progress of population undertakes to frame, within two years from date of final approval of Mandate, an organic law to come into force after approval by League. &quot; This organic &quot; law shall be framed in consultation with the native authorities, and shall take &quot; account of the rights, interests and wishes of all the populations inhabiting the &quot; mandated territory.&quot; It shall contain provisions designed to facilitate the progressive development of Mesopotamia as a self-governing State until such time as it can stand by itself, when the &quot; services of the Mandatory being no longer required, &quot; the Mandatory undertakes to propose the admission of Mesopotamia to the League &quot; of Nations.&quot; Pending the preparation of the organic law the Mandatory shall act in accordance with the spirit of this mandate in provisional administration of Mesopotamia.Article II. provides for the organisation of necessary force. Article III. The Mandatory Power to control foreign relations. Article IV.-No Mesopotamian territory to be ceded or leased to foreign Government.Article V. abrogates capitulations, the Mandatory being responsible for the efficiency of the judicial regime.   &quot; In particular, the control and administration of &quot; Wakfs shall be exercised in accordance with religious law and the wishes of the founders.&quot;Article VI. Mandatory ensures freedom of conscience and free exercise of all forms of worship.Article VII. &quot;Nothing in this Mandate should be construed as authorising; &quot;Mandatory to interfere with fabric or managing of the Sacred Shrines, the immu-&quot; nities of which are guaranteed.&quot;Article VIII. All inhabitants of Mesopotamia and all missionaries entitled to maintain educational institutions, with use of their own language.Article IX. Missionary bodies may acquire property of every description.10  1699     100  6.20
i)uArticle X. Nationals of States, members of League of Nations, to enjoy equality with those of Mandatory.Article XL secures similar equality to ships and aircraft. This and preceding paragraph are, however, subject to proviso that Mesopotamian Government may, in accord with Mandatory, conclude Customs convention with Syria or other Arab State, and may also develop national resources, and organise essential public servises, on such terms and conditions as it considers best.Article XII. Concessions to be granted by Mesopotamian Government on advice of Mandatory. No distinction to be made on grounds of nationality between nationals &apos; of States, members of the League of Nations. .  *Later articles still under consideration will be telegraphed later.        &quot;i.From Secretary of State to Civil Commissioner, Baghdad,7th June im.(Repeated to Viceroy.)- Priority A.P. 4216 (2). My immediately preceding telegram. Mesopotamian mandate. You will observe that mandatory will be required to consult native authorities in framing organic law. Necessity of creating &quot; native authorities &quot; for purposes of such consultation is fully-recognised, but His Majesty&apos;s Government do not wish to call into being prematurely institutions which though avowedly provisional in character and designed to serve temporary purpose might tend to become stereotyped. Some time must necessarily elapse before mandate can receive final approval of League of Nations, and it is therefore impossible to proceed at once with preparation of organic law.Secondly, I am glad -to say that I am now in a position to furnish you with the authority for which you ask to announce impending return of Sir P. Cox. His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that, as Cox is to inaugurate new regime, it is only right that he should be Consulted as to constitution, &amp;c. of councils which it will be his task to control. For these reasons immediate&apos; execution of your proposals is not considered practicable. But subject to reservations on points of detail your recommendations are accepted in principle as furnishing a generally suitable basis on which to construct provisional institutions such as are postulated by mandate.You may make, immediate announcement accordingly on lines indicated in my immediately following telegram. You should be careful not to commit yourself or His Majesty&apos;s Government on points of detail such as exact constitution of Council of State, allocation of portfolios, &amp;c.From Secretary of State to Civil Commissioner, Baghdad,7th June 1920.(Repeated to Viceroy.)P. 4216 (3). My immediately preceding telegram.. Mesopotamian constitution. You are authorised to make immediate announcement on following lines :  &quot;(R.) His Majesty&apos;s Government, having agreed to accept mandate for Mesopotamia, await the formal definition of its terms by the League of Nations. They anticipate that the mandate will lay upon them responsibility for maintaining internal&apos;peace and external security and will require them to formulate within.a fixed period, which will probably not exceed two years, an organic law. to be framed in consultation with the native authorities1 and with due regard to rights, interests and wishes of all populations of mandated territory.u His Majesty&apos;s Government, having regard to expressed wishes of people of Mesopotamia for return of Sir P. Cox, have decided to entrust to him task of framing organic law. He will accordingly return to Baghdad next autumn, and will reassume position, on termination of existing military administration, of chief British repre-sentative in Mesopotamia.&quot;Sir P. Cox will be authorised to call into being (1) a predominantly Arab Council of State under an Arab President, and (2) a general Assembly representative of the peoples of Mesopotamia as a whole, and it will be his duty to prepare, in consultation with these provisional bodies, a permanent organic law to be submitted by His Majesty&apos;s Government for the approval of the League of Nations.&quot;   (End of li.)The above indicates lines which your announcement should follow. You need not consider yourself tied down to exact form of words.
(P 4593) From Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, 0th June 1920.(Copy to General Officer Commanding-in-Chief by despatcli rider, repeated to Teheran and India.)(Received 10 a.m., 10th.)Clear the line. 6948.   Secret,I. Recent developments have caused review of whole situation of Mesopotamia, arising out of the announcement&apos; of grant of mandate and its reception by public in this country.   Anticipations recorded in first part of my telegram of 16th November, 1918, and in para. No. 4 of my telegram of the 10th December are nearing realisation.II. During the last 18 months&apos; progress of demobilisation, withdrawal of experienced civil officers and their departure on leave have given men of all classes in this country reason to doubt whether we are prepared or are in a position to give effect to our obligations under mandate. Speeches in Parliament and newspaper opinions quoted in Reuter&apos;s have emphasised these doubts.III. Our Army is now, alike in numbers, composition and fighting efficiency, incapable of defending the population of frontier divisions of Mosul and Dulaim against aggression, and of maintaining, or, in case of need, restoring internal order over any considerable area.IV. Both the above divisions were protected from Sharifian aggression up till October last by the Dair-az-Zor. division : its separation from Mesopotamia by Peace Conference, and circumstance of its seizure by xArabs (? crossing the frontier), led to a succession of incidents, cumulative effect of which threatens to be disastrous, the latest incident being the outrage of Tel Afar.V. Last February I warned Government that we must hold what we then had with the troops then in the country, or clear out, and that there was no middle course. Events have shown that this was not an over-statement.VI. The garrison has been further reduced, with the result that we have had to abandon area (corrupt group) holding. The geographical situation of the country, the nature of its frontier and the disposition of its inhabitants and neighbours is such that the abandonment of control of any considerable part of Mesopotamia involves evacuation of whole, excepting Basra.VII. The history of this country for the past few thousand years and the practical experience of the past three, alike convince me that we cannot give effect to mandate without risk of disaster, unless we are prepared to maintain for the next two years at least as many troops in the country as we may have, and in a state considerably more efficient than they are now, and to complete so-called military lines to Hit, Qaiyara, Kirkuk at once.VIII. Unless we can regain possession of Dair-az-Zor up to Rakka inclusive, as part of Mesopotamia, and maintain our hold on. it hereafter, we shall have to keep more and not less troops than we now have. Its re-occupatiOu would, I believe, for the present at all events put an end to most of our difficulties, but it would require more troops and much more transport than we now have available.IX. Whilst acting in accordance with spirit and,, so far as may be, with letter of mandate, wTe cannot maintain our position as mandatory by a policy of conciliationFroih Secretary oj State to Civil Commissioner, Baghdad,  &apos;1th June 1920. &apos;    .(Repeated to Viceroy.)Priority A.P. 4210 (4). My telegrams of to-day. Mesopotamia!! constitution. You will appreciate considerations that have guided His Majesty&apos;s Government in deciding that Cox shall return to Mesopotamia to inaugurate new regime. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment regard it as specially fitting that the man who laid first foundations of edifice of Civil Administration should also supervise concluding stages of construction. &quot;&quot;But they do not overlook magnificent work which has been accomplished in intermediate period, and which alone has rendered practicable the further advance now in contemplation. They take this opportunity of conveying to you their most cordial and grateful acknowledgments of the high ability and unflagging zeal with which during past 2k years you have devoted yourself with such markedly successful results to your difficult and laborious task.
(P 4625) From Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, Mi June 1920.(Repeated to Simla, Tehran.) (deceived 11th, 10 a.rn.)(R.)   6976.   Your telegrams, dated 7th June, were received after the despatch-of my telegram dated 9th June, No. 6948, which, however, I see no reason to modify. Now that the policy has been settled, it is more necessary that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should realise what the execution of the Mandate is likely to entail in immediate future, and that it should make its dispositions accordingly.Announcement on lines ordered in your telegrams of 7th June will be made at the end of Ramazan, about 18th June.It will doubtless evoke lively protests from extremists who will (demand ?) complete independence, and further demonstrations may be engineered.I propose to meet situation by suggesting that deputation from Mesopotamia of not more than eight persons in all from various parts of the country should proceed to England to lay their views before His Majesty&apos;s Government. There is reason to think this proposal which I hope to secure spontaneously from them will be favourably received.As soon, as deputation has started, or been decided on, I consider we shall have-gone as far as we can in the direction of conciliation, and I shall feel myself strong enough to take drastic action against the small gang of leading irreconcilables, whose increasing influence constitutes a public danger, and whose suppression is urged on me almost every day by leading men all over the country.This will put heart into moderates and facilitate formation of a centre party which does not at present exist, with the result that extremists have the stage to themselves.&apos;., It would be of great assistance to me to know what reception an application from such a deputation to visit London would be likely to receive from His&apos; Majesty&apos;s. Government in the event of its being submitted and endorsed by me.of extremists. Having (? set our) hand to (the) task of regenerating the (? internal government we must be prepared to furnish alike men and money, and to maintain continuity of control (? for) years to come. We must be prepared, regardless of League of Nations, to go very slowly with constitutional or democratic institutions, the application of which to Eastern countries has been attempted of late years with such little degree of success.X. If His Majesty&apos;s Government regard such a policy as impracticable or beyond our strength (as well they may), I submit they would do better to face the alternative, formidable, and, from local point of view, terrible as it is, and evacuate Mesopotamia. I would not hesitate remaining myself in Mesopotamia, if so ordered, or&quot; to return thereto for the execution of such a policy at whatever cost, as I am no,w reluctantly compelled to believe that former alternative is beyond our present strength. Equally would I be prepared in any (? group omitted) to assist in giving effect to more virile policy outlined above, which I have advocated in principle and in detail for the past six years, but it is my conviction that half measures will end in disasters, such as those which have overtaken French detachments in Syria, and I fear that it is half measures that are now in contemplation.XI. The problems of Mesopotamia cannot, however, be solved entirely from within. Its solution depends on the discovery of a formula which will restore order and harmony and limit ambitions in Syria and Turkey, and in a satisfactory solution for Mesopotamia will be found key to progress in Persia.To restore shaken confidence of public if we stay, or to enable us to evacuate if we go, more troops are needed. It is for General Officer Commanding-in-Ohief to say how many, when and where.The above telegram has not been shown to or discussed with General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, firstly, because he is in Persia and, secondly, (? because) issues are of such vast importance that I consider it best to place my views before you on my own responsibility.
