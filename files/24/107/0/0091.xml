The feeling of the employers seems to be that at the present rate in the increase of wages they must either fight or close down their works, and if the fight has got to come they had better have it now while they are full of orders.   Their great hope is that the Government will stand out of it and let them settle the matter with their employees.   Already, in one important engineering firm, the London works have shown a deficit and the Directors are considering the closing of one factory, which will involve the unemployment of 7,000 men.   On July 1st the engineering fusion becomes effective and the employers believe that it will work until the whole industry is made impossible under private ownership.In the first week of July the National Conferences of the railwayraen and the miners ?/ill formulate fresh demands.Scarcely less serious is the unrest among the agricultural workers, who have taken kindly to the revolutionary propaganda of the extremists.   The unrest may culminate in a strike during the harvest.The Electrical Trades Union is also threatening a strike at the beginning of July on the question of the employment of non-Union menOn the other hand, a settlement of the gas workers&apos; claims seems possible.The/
The Twentieth Annual Conference of the Labour Party, fixed for June 22nd-85th, seems likely to result in a movement towards the Left,   This may be due. in a large measure to the able propaganda emanating from Eocleston Square.   Although the apostles of violent revolution are making little headway, the country is in the throes of an evolution so intensive as to amou to a revolution.It ia proposed to hold the special Trades Union Congress, which will deal with the handling of munitions, during the second week in July.    .The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has received a windfall of  38,500 from the Miners federation of Great Britain.
eS Z 5The reports received ,sinoe ray last report confirm the view then expressed that the railwaymen as a whole will accept the recent award.   My Yorkshire correspondent, for instance, writes:-   &quot;There have been vigorous -discussions over the smallness of the award and numerous protests have been sent to headquarters.   The announcements W Mt, Thomas and Mr. Cramp that it is a case of accept or strike, and the defeat of the French railwaymen have kept the firebrands in check and there is, so far, little effective opposition.&quot;In Liverpool and laancheeter the dissatisfaction is extreme, but the award is likely to be accepted with bad grace and a ner demand immediately advanced.   The discrepancy between the pay of dockers end railwaymen is the chief stumbling block.   Forcible resolutions have been passed demanding the resignation of railway offioials who sit on the National Wages Board, and a minimum wage of  5 per week for all railwaymen, while others record &quot;disgust&quot; with end repudiation of the award.On June 15th a large meeting of Newcastle railwaymen accepted the award but demanded a 44 hour week in order to reduce unemployment.   Bailwaymen at West Hartlepool have instructed their delegate to move the rejection of the award and demand the re-opening of negotiations on the claim for an increase of  1.A good illustration of the influence of extremists is furnished in a report on the proceedings of the Tottenham branch of the National Union of Ifcilwa^men. When the settlement was submitted, each grade seemed well pleased with the award.   Then a fow speakers complained of the difference bet?/een the amounts granted and demanded and the whole tone of the meeting changed.   It was thenpractically/
m    2   -practically decided to reject the settlement, but in the face of violent opposition a resolution was passed deferrin decision until a special meeting had been held. &apos;SOUTH WAL33 IIIJ83RSAn important resolution was passed at the /jmual Conference of the South Wales Miners1 Federation which was held in Cardiff on June 14th, under the presidency of Mir. William Brace, LLP.   It was resolved to request the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain to amend the rule governing national strikes so that a bare majority in any ballot would be sufficient to warrant a national stoppage.During the discussion of the financial position of the Federation it transpired that a sum of  139,907 had been received.as contributions and  8,790 as a levy for the Bed? colliery workmen in connection with the long standing Bedwa conveyor dispute of last year, making a total of  148,697. The sum of  11,536 represented interest on deposits and investments.   The total expenditure for 1919 was given as  124, 626, and the total worth of funds as  412,484. leaving a credit balance of  287,858 on 31.12.19.   During the year  26,043 was paid put in out-of-work pay,  17,359 in strike pay and  22,087 in lock-out pay.It was stated that thd average membership for the past year was 185,044.A resolution was also passed, requiring that industrial action be taken if the cost of living is not reduced by August 1st next. THE &quot;BANDS OFF RUSSIA&quot; M0VBHB8JPThe bi-weekly meetings in Groevenor Square continue; the audience is composed chiefly of aliens and,apart from the inconvenience, the meetings are of little importance.The/
The big demonstration, to which I have already referred, has been arranged to be held in G-rosvenor Sauare on June 20th.rThe letter from Lenin to British workers, which appeared in the &quot;times&quot; on June 11th, was ignored by all the Labour Press except the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; which, with its usual &quot;bad   . faith, deliberately omitted the paragraphs likely to incense responsible Labour without any indication of the lacunae. LeninTs amazing ignorance of conditions in this country make the publication of the letter &quot;broadcast well worth while, especially in view of the line that has &quot;been taken by Messrs. Turner and Shaw, the members of the ft- hour Delegation who have returned from R-issi&apos;-.My Yorkshire correspondent reports that the return of Mr, Ben Turner has quickened interest in Russian affairs in the West Riding.    Of: &quot;June 13th he addressed a meeting of some 1,500 people at Batley and is&apos; repbrted to hare spoken in glowing terms of the Bolsheviks,&apos; taking exception only  to support of*the regime by force, refusal of the&apos; vote to those who would not work or employed others for personal profit, and the abolition of free speech sad a free press.    On these points, however, Mr. Turner said he had cuostioned Lenin, who had had the better of the argument.    Iv . correspondent states that Kr. Turner scouted the idea of compulsory labour and prohibited strikes and urged that it was ridiculous to say a man could strike against. himself, the industries belonged to the community and were managed &quot;by tho workers themselves, many of the former owners were working now as managers and foremen.    My correspondent is of the opinion that Hr. Turner&quot;s advocacy will -gain much support for the Bolshevik regime in the West Riding.Mr.. Tom. Shaw also eulogised the Bolsheviks at a Labour meeting in Colne on June 9th.    It would seem that these two delegates are -nzious to counteract the first Press accounts oftheir/
their impression of Soviet Russia.The interim report of the delegation demands the recognition of the Soviet Republic and the raising of the blockade, &quot;matters of special urgency&quot;.   Criticism of the working of tho Bolshevik regime is apparently reserved until the return of the whole deputation.TH3S AGRICULTURAL VY0PJ3RS&apos; UHOKThere has been a very remarkable development in the membership of the Agricultural Labourers7 Union, from approximately 23,000 in 1915 to over 160,000 in 1 20.   Apartj..:]:&apos;-.&apos;;&apos; ,V&apos; - ^i:.; &apos; &apos;&apos; *from the fact that the increase in wages threatens to absorb the entire profits of many farmers, the propa^agenda of the Union is giving a strongly revolutionary bias to labourers in the rural districts. , So/uo kind of counter propaganda seen urgently to be required.   The teaching of the Union Ju.s given rise, in some districts, to a talk of seizing the land, and a well informed correspondent states that in remote villages in Suffolk he found the farm hands talking of a strike during the forthcoming harvest, and declaring that if their demands are not conceded they will seize and occupy the land themselve It will be remembered that at the recent Conference in Leicester nationalisation of the land was advocated since &quot;no adequate solution of the land problem is possible while the land is privately owned.&quot;Some 10,000 $ssex farm workers have already balloted in favour of a strike from June 27th, the strike having been sanctioned at a National Delegate Conference held in London on June 15th.   This Conference decided to allow all County Committees to call a strike &quot;at their discretion in support of the claim for a minimum wage of 60s. Od per week.   It seems probable that tho Cheshire labourers will call a strike simultaneously with Sssex.   This may be followed by a more or less general strike.PROTESTS/
&quot;* 5 -327 &apos;PR0T3STS AG AIN SI IHOBJUSBD R3HTSMy correspondent reports that Scotland is greatly agitated over the Rent Bill and a number of proposals are being passed to defeat the proposed increase in rents.   The average, workman, j in discussing the matter, apparently has not so much objection , to higher rents being paid for new houses as to the increase in the rents of occupied houses, on which no repairs have been done.   In many parts of Scotland meetings are being held and if the proposals contained in the Bill are not modified, he expects that there will be some violent demonstrations.   The Glasgow Corporation has discussed the matter at great length and has carried a resolution that any increase in rent should not be greater than 25$ over the rent in August 1014.Re adds that apart from the working classes the shop-keepers are protesting against the proposals contained in the Bill inasmuch as they receive no protection whatever against increase of rent, and tfents of shops in the cities are increasing enormously.   Of course it is urged that the shop keepers can pass on any increase of rent to the customers, but in nyany oases this is impossible as there is no security of tenure and the smaller shop keepers especially are inclined to support the labour position with regard to that matter.In Sngland opposition is also growing and a &quot;no rent&quot; strike is advocated by many Trades and labour Councils.THIS SCARBOROUGH QOSgBRIBMOBFrom June 22nd to 25th the Dritish Labour Party will meet in Annual Conference at Scarborough.   The &quot;General&quot; resolutions of the final agenda differ little from those which have been passed with unfailing regularity at previous^oflferenews. Others relating, to the administration and constitution of the party are, of more importance. $
The advance report of the British Labour delegation, with whioh Mr. Turner and Mr, Shaw will deal, will add to the interest of the Conference.A resolution and a variety of amendments deal with the question of affiliation to the Second and Third International The test is put by the British Socialist Party ,which moves secession from the Second and affiliation with the Third. Resolutions which are apparently intended to prevent new intellectual converts from standing as Labour candidates are noteworthy.   The British Socialist Party urges that only those candidates should be accepted &quot;who pledge themselves to use the political weapon as a means of more vigorously waging the revolutionary class struggle and establishing the dictatorship of the workers, and ultimately overthrowing the capitalist system&quot;.   Party agents form the subject of several resolutions, the most important being the motion for the appointment of full time agents in every division to be contested, on a uniform system of control and payment. Labour members of Parliament are severely censured in several resolutions, four of which advocate the abolition of dual office holding.The financial position of the Party is dealt with in the Agenda by the Executive Committee who propose to increase affiliation foes from 2d. to 3d. per member per year.   The estimated membership for 1920 is 3,500,000 and would yield an income of  43,750.   The following items of the budget of prospective annual expenditure, which is expected to amount to  42,150, are of interest:-Organising Expenses ............  9,500Grants to Party Agents .........   6,800International..................   1,500Head Office Salaries ...........   4,000Head Office Expenses...........   2,000Literature, &quot;Labour NewsService&quot;, and Information Bureau 7,600 Advisory Committees ............   2,000Parliamentary Party............   2,000Propaganda campaigns ...........   2,000An/
al the official report of the Glasgow Conference contains1some useful information about the strength of the Party. The membership claimed to be approximately 45,000, of whom 37,420 only were paid op members.   Numerically, therefore, the party is quite insignificant;-, but its activity is entirely out of-proportion to.its numerical strength, for it has 706 members in,Municipal Councils, 90 in Educational Authorities and 379 in Boards of Guardians and Parish Councils.   There was an income of  5,196 acd a deficit of  8. 19s. 2d.   Bye-eleotions have coet the Party *iS*?0.   The funds invested in the National Labour Press and the B.&apos;-.ar;kfriars Press amount to  5,913, thfc output of hooks 41,000 and of pamphlets 14,000, in addition to leaflets.   The Left Wing started a fortnightly Journalentitled/An examination of the Labour Press has disclosed the fact that nearly &amp;I4. the Labour newspapers and Trade Union Journals accept paragraphs prepared by the Labour News Service in Eccleston Square.   This Department, which wasrformed at the time of the Railway Strike last September,&apos; ; &quot; is cleverly conducted, and as the Service covers practically, all home end international matters which can be treated as material for class warfare, the effect must be very considerable.   The paragraphs have no indication of their source and Labour readers are therefore unconsciously educated to think on standard lines.It is worthy of note that the nomination for the Party&apos;s officers include many extremists, who, if elected, would undoubtedly give the Party revolutionary leadership.   At the Bame time the importance cf the Party should not be over-rated, as its political power is small and the industrial power remains, at present, with the Trade Unions.THE INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTY
entitled &quot;The International&quot;, out the first issue, dated June 19th, is merely a rechauffe of the Party squabbles and contains no new features.,The Parliamentary Labour Party has refused to extend to Mr. Ramsay Macdonald a unanimous invitation to act, as adviser and this incident has served to emphasize the fact that the leaders who support What is termed the &quot;Second and a half&quot; International, are losing their hold on the Labour movement.THB SCOTTISH TRAPS)S UNION CONSRI33SOn July 10th a special meeting of the Scottish Trade Union Congress will be held at Glasgow to deal with the position in Ireland, Poland and Russia, the high cost of living and the rent question.   The official agenda shows the resolutions to consist of a series of protests, but give no indication of strike action shoiild the demands not receive the attention of the Government.The Congress has a membership of about 500,8000.F3BLIKG mm J3Z-SOLDIERSMy correspondents1 reports have indicated latterly that the activities of the steadier ex-Service men&apos;s organisations are declining and that the members are assuming the role of ordinary citizens, without any particule sympathy for Labour.An exception must, however, be made in the oase of the National Union of Ex-Service Hen, which has many active branches in London and in the provinces.   The number of those which are;decidedly extreme is 105.   A. B. Mander has recentl been speaking in South Wales on the Geneva Conference and claims that progress has been made towards the organisation of an international strike, should another war be declared.
1   329In certain areas the ox-Service men have local grievances; in Nottinghamshire, for instance, my correspondent reports .  that some 8,000 are at present unemployed and that they talk - of sending a deputation to the Prime Minister.In Northampton the men threaten to occupy the empty houses and in Newcastle they claim that disabled men, especially those who are unable to work at all, should have their pensions increased.Trouble arising from discharges appears to be brewing again at Woolwich.LABOUR COUNCILLORSIt is interesting to find that in South IVales the Labour Councillors have failed to give satisfaction to the rank and file.   The Porth trades and Labour Council, which is controlled by the miners, has resolved that L&amp;bour Councillors shall submit to their Trades Council the agenda of the Municipal Council meetings in advance in order that they may be instructed as to how they are to vote.   Labour Councillors form the majority of the Porth Town Council and they have declined to comply. A very pretty dispute has  grown out of this difference and the Trades Council is determined to beat down the spirit of independence on the part of its representatives.TH  COMMUNIST PARTYThe efforts of Hiss Sylvia Pankhurst to form a Communist  arty pledged not to take part in Parliamentary Elections seem doomed to failure.  None, of the other Communist bodies will listen to her and she has not sufficient following for forming an independent body of her own.   And now, to crown her misfortunes, there are whispers that she may be in league in some way with the Authorities.According to a notice that has appeared in the Butch papers
a National Communist Congress is planned to be held in London on or about August 1st, to pass resolutions in favour  4 of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, the Soviet system and the Third International.   The movement will be watched.THB &quot;DAILY HffRALD&quot; &apos; &apos; . ,., . &apos; . IThe largest sum hitherto, invested ,in ,t,he &quot;DaUy Herald&quot; by any Trades Union changed hands on June 11th,. when,..Prank Hodges paid in 238,500 for 5$ Debenture.;S1?ook.   It is estimated that the total amount invested by the Miners&apos;. Federation of Croat Britain will be over  43,000.The Manchester and Salford Co-operative Society wishes the Co-operative Wholesale Society to invest  10,000 in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, presumably as a protest against &quot;the organised attack on the Co-operative movement by the capitalist Press and commercial organisations.&quot;   It is not, however, certain that the investment will be made as the Society is straining every nerve to raise more capital for the extension of its own business.Another proposal that the National Co-operative Publishing Society Ltd. shall not proceed with the proposed Co-operative daily., but invest the money earmarked in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, seems more,likely to be accepted.SINN Fail! IN GREAT BRITAIRThere is at present little.prospect that,, the. stroubles of the Executive of the National.Union of Railwaymen with their Irish members will be easily settled.   Mr. Cramp&apos;s visit to ,  Ireland appears to have been fruitless and thp courageous speech of Mr. Thomas at Paddington will not make matters easier.    No definite information has yet been received regarding the Conference of.the Executive of the National Union of Railwaymen with representatives of the Irish branches of theUnion/
Union, which began at Bristol yesterday and will conclude to-day.   It is stated that some hundred Irish delegates attended, including about twenty from Ulster, and that speeches were made bv the new president, Mr. Abrahams, and by Mr. ThoraaB and Mr. Cramp.   So far the proceedings are believed to have been harmonious-The appeal of the two Irish Trade Unionists to the recent conference of the Transport Workers federation appears to have alienated such sympathy as existed for their cause. Mr. Johnson&apos;s threats of cutting off food supplies to Britain and derailing troop trains were&quot;a tactical error.The Irish Self-Determination League held the usual meetings in different parts of London during the week.   !4y correspondents state that feeling amongst them is becoming more bitter owing to the despatch of troops to Ireland.   The membership of the League is increasing, as is the number of branches.   The branch recently formed at Whitechapel is growing rapidly.On June 11th my correspondent was present at Boggart Bole Clough, Manchester, where arrangements had been made to hold a Sinn Fein meeting.   The meeting was not advertised in any way but members of the Irish Self-Betermination League were informed privately end the proceedings were more or less of a secret nature.   Two or three well known speakers who were to have %een present to explain the position, including Mr. Sean Milroy, did not attend and the audience numbered about 30 persons.   A Mr. Michael Coyne (who was a stranger to roost of those present) said a large number of persons had been invited, but at the last moment it had been decided to abandon the meeting, mainly because Of the inability of Milroy to be present, also because they thought it better to hold their meetings indoors.   Be then made a short andsomewhat/
somewhat mysterious speech which was practically a repetition of the remarks made by Sean Milroy and mentioned in my last report. 1At a meeting of the Coventry Irish Club last week it &quot;&quot;was proposed-that ex-Service members should join the NationUnion of Ex-Service Hen, as this was considered&apos; the best - way of assisting Sinn Fein.   The suggestion was well received.On June 13th an enthusiastic mass meeting of some 2,000 Irish men and women at Newcastle pledged itself to give financial and moral support to the Irish workers who have refused to handle munitions.Sean OVSheehan has been appointed assistant organiser to the Executive of the Scottish Sinn Fein group by the Glasgow Central Circle of the Irish Republican 3rotherhood He will assist Tom v?hite to organise all the Irish in Scotland and to attend Sinn Fein concerts.   He was at one t: imprisoned in Ireland for seditious acts and attacking the police.   It is reported that his campaign in Scotland is supported by the Irish clergy and has already resulted in 250 recruits to the movement.ireland there was no improvement in the state of the Provinces .during the past week and the country generally remains in a most lawless and disturbed condition.   A decline in agrardaj outrages is ascribed to the operations of Sinn Fein arbitration courts and the anxiety of the leaders to restra the land hunger of their followers lest it may alienate tiw farming class.   Proclamations have appeared in several counties warning persons from pushing un.just claims by intimidation and outrage and directing them to wait until t! Irish Republic is in a position to daal with the land questThe/
The results of the Local Government Elections show that the whole of Connaught and in nearly all Monster the County Councils are exclusively Sinn IPein.   Throughout  &apos;. Leinster this party also has a largo majority on the Councils.Tho success of the Sinn Pein party at the Urban District Council Elections has enabled them to continue their old policy of placing their leaders in different municipal positions as a camouflage for their activities.   In the past they have found that this method helped them in their propaganda abroad to substantiate the lie, when such men were arrested, that the Government was arresting harmless city Councillors,   An example of this policy occurred at a munioipal meeting at Rathminos, Dublin, when the notorious Sinn Feiner, Joseph McDonagh, made a farce of the meeting by putting up a long list of names containing many of the most extreme rebels, such as T. J. Cullon, for &quot;election in place of a member who has been disqualified.   In connection with the Local Government Board elections it is noteworthy that only 3^ of,the electors voted.   This appears to have been due to lack of interest and, in some cases, to intimidation.   Those of the vote rs-who were not actively Sinn Foin saw that it was safer not to vote at all.Labour was not very successful at the Local Government Elections.   The chief interest in Labour circles at present centres on the question of the refusal of the dockers and railwaymen to handle military stores, and there is some talk of a railway strike.   Mr. 0, T. Cramp, Secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen, v&amp;s in Dublin -endecpouring to open negotiations.   The Irish Labour Party have definitely supported the Railwaymen in their strike and i,i&apos;l negotiations have so far failed.   It is reported thatlack/
lack of funds is causing tho leadors considerable anxiety.   Notices are being published in tho Press calling on all Irishmen to contribute to tho strike funds, but it is balieved that tho general public have contributed practically nothing.Tho measures taken by the Government are making it more difficult every day for the Irish Republican Army to carry out effective operations.   A correspondent points out that when the attaoking force must necessarily make provision for the removal of their wounded, who would otherwise be liable to trial and a long sentence of imprisonment, the ardour of the rank and file must be considerably damped.There is definite evidence of the deliberate polioy of Sinn Fein to mark down loyal officials.   It is probable that an effort will be made to hold up the Summer Assizes by intimidating Jurors, litigants, e&apos;cM and local Justioes are being called upon to resign with a promise that their position will be restored to them under an Irish Republican Government.There is additional evidence to hand showing that the Bolsheviks in Holland are endeavouring to help the Iritsh revolutionaries by supplying them with arms and ammunition, but the confession is made that great difficulty is experienced In this owing to the preventive measures takefi by the British Government.
