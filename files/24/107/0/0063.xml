tdecision of the Cabinet,2299QT.J,M,BONUS   ON   WAR   PENSIONS.Strong representations have been made on the part of ex-service men and their dependants, both inside and outside Parliament, in favour of the grant of a bonus on pensions and allowances to meet the recent increase in the cost of living.The present rates of pension and allowance   were fixed In accordance with the recommendations of the Select Committee in September last, and the rates then allowed represented a very substantial increase - ranging from 40$ to 100$ - over the , corresponding rates in. 1915,   The average increase was rather over 60$,&quot; At the same, time, the Government stipulated that these increased rates should remain in force until torch, 1925. and should thereafter be subject to variation up or down, according to the increase or decrease in the cost of living, provided that no change should be made unless the cost of living showed a variation of at least 5 per cent as compared with the cost in 1919.   Ey this three years1 settlement, the pensioner benefited materially if the cost of living went down to any appreciable extent.At the time these rates were fixed, the cost of living was (according to the index numbers of the Ministry of Labour) 115$ higher than before the war.   Since September last, there has been an appreciable rise in the cost of living and at the latest date for whichf  n ggpat 1 on is available, the index number stands at 141$ - a increase of 26$ over pre-war prices.   The course of prices in the immediate future cannot, naturally, be foreseen, but the Ministry of Labour anticipate that the figure for June will be about 150 per cent.In these circumstances, and having regard to the recent adjustments of wage rates in various industries, we consider that the effect of the increased cost of living on pensioners cannot be ignored,   Eut we feel that it is important to maintain the three years 1 settlement which was arrived at last September, This settlement was embodied in a Royal Warrant, and involved a careful consideration of the relative claims of each single class of pensioner and the adjustment of the existing rates so as to meet those claims.   This settlement could not, in fairness to the State, be maintained if all the rates of pension and allowance now current were revised,  Any increase in pension rates should therefore be given by way of temporary bonus only.   We have come to the conclusion that a bonus on the lines indicated hereunder should be announced as from the 1st September next to theSLst March, 1V21; the position thereafter to be reviewed in the light of the then cost of living.We have considered carefully, also, the extent of application of the proposed bonus.   There are two alternativesi the bonus can be granted to all classes of pensioner, or to the limited class of those who are drawing what may be called aisubsistence
subsistence pension, that Is, men in re-ceipt of total disablement pensions, widows and certain classes of dependants.   To grant the bonus to all classes of pensioner would, in our opinion, be more than is justifiable.   The great majority of partially disabled men are at work and drawing full wages, which have been increased to meet the increased cost of living, and to pay bonus on their pensions is to pay twice,over for the increased cost of living.rM05t*$over, in the cage of the smaller rates of pension, the grant of a bonus proportionate to the maximum which can justifiably be allowed in cases of total disablement, &apos;would be far too small (e,g, l/- or 2/- a week) to be appreciable.   The cost of a bcnus payable to all classes at the rate we have judged to be justifiable, viz: 20$ on the 1915 rates, would be heavy and would amount, for 6 months, to about  6,000,000.We propose, therefore, the following scheme:-(a) a bonus of 5/** a week (- 20% increase on the maximum rate of disability pension in 1915) to be paid to all disabled men drawing total disablement pension, or in receipt of allowances in respect of either medical treatment or training at the maximum pension rate;(b) a bonus of 2/6d, a week (- about 20$ increase on the 1915 rate of widows1 pension) to all widows over&apos; 40 or having children under their care; ,(c) a bonus of 2/6d. a week to all dependants in receipt of a pension based on need.These rates of bonus to be payable for V months from the 1st September to the 51st March.   It is estimated that the cost of granting bonus on these lines Would amount to  2,250,000.I.M. T o CT * M*15th June, 1920.
