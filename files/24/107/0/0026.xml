*.   103(THIS DOCUMENT IS T)v PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT ilhvIO MAJTKTY&apos;8 OOV:*RNfPNT).CP, 1426CABINET0yOClTIO^LVL TRAINING OF J7Q*ffWp,Jfcm^randum by tho Clmncellor of thoJ^xcjioquer,lft In his memorandum (Co?01337) the Minister of Labour requestsCabinet authority to continue a scheme for the vocational training &apos;   of women beyond the date, June 30th, fixed for its doterinination0 I am stncugly opposed to this proposals     The scheme has been e::tonded already once or twice *    When the matter was last considered in Decemberj I agreed to an extension till Juno 30th only with very great reluctance and on receipt of an assurance from tho then Minister of Labour in the following terms:&quot; &quot;So far as I am capable of judging but without professing to have the gift of foreseeing all that may happen, no further extension will be sought&quot;o2q I cannot find  hat any circumstance has arisen since december which would require a reversal of tho decision,.     On thecontrary a grant of  500,000 has boon obtained from the Prince of-Tales Fund which is being applied to a training scheme for womencorresponding to what is being done for officers and men of likeeducational - qualifications9Much of the opposition which has boen expressed to thetermination of the scheme rests on the mistaken notion that women are being deprived of the benefits of a scheme which is stillbeinp; continued for men,,     Tho present position, on the contrary.,In that the scheme now In question which applies to women whohave worked in munition factories or Government offices, goesentirely beyond anything which it has been found possible to dofor men0    Up to the present; save for a special scheme dealing with apprentices, ex-service men are not being trained unless so far disabled as to be unable to follow their former occupations.... *3C The date selected,, Juno 30th; is undoubtedly a suitable one for terminating the scheme,     In assenting to this/
this date being fixed In December-, I        partly1&apos;influenced bythe argument that employment might be expected to be at its best - in midsummer..The Minister of Labour quotes figures shewing the numbers of unemployed women on the live Register of the Unemployment Exchanges.     The figures shew a great reduction since November 7th.   The figures of vacancies&quot;existing, not quoted by the Minister of Labour, are far move remarkable.   The following particulars, which relate to the week ending May 14th, are taken from the official statistics of the Unemployment Exchanges&apos;:-Live Register (^n      273,772 (Men    33,971(i..e.. seeking employment. (Boys      11,819   Vacancies (Boys     5,753(Women 48,529 existing,(&quot;Women 46,625 (Girls     11,257 (Gins 10,256The contrast between the general conditions as tounemolovmeut between men and women is astonlshin/r.     Surelythe figures show also tha&apos;t no more appropriate date than thepresent month could be selected for terminating the scheme,when the number of vacancies is all but equal to the numbersseeking employment.As regards the reference to a Reoort of the Sub-Committee of tho National Vhitley Council, T am informed that it was made abundantly clear to the staff side that temporary &apos; clerks from Government offices could participate in any national scheme for training which existed but could not be given special privileges.The termination of the scheme on June 30th does not apply to the training of War widows and disabled nurses given under the Royal Earvant.(Intlld.)
