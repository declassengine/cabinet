IHIS DOCUITOT IS THE PROJEBTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCABINST. Copy HoCP, 1459.LAND S3TTLSMT OF EX-SOTICE MEN IK ENGLAND Am) WALES. Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. -Service 1,    Although it is only ten months since the Landlplicatio&quot;ns. Settlement (Facilities) Act was passed, the number of. appli-cations for small holdings received from suitable and qualified ex-service men is far more than sufficient to absorb the whole of the money which has been provided for the purpose.   I, therefore, feel it my duty to lay the facts before the Cabinet, and, on the assumption that no further funds will be available, to submit for cone ids rat ion certain expedients for dealing with the situation.2.    The following figures show the position on June 14th;Applications received by Councils from ex-Service men 36,83?.Appnved as suitable ................. 21,456.Awaiting interview or still under consideration..............*........   7,820*Number of holdings actually provided by Councils since 1st January, 1919, (including 1,181 let to civilians)       7,137.Estimated number of additional holdings for which land haa been acquired but not yet subdivided and let as small holdings ...............   6,955Additional number of holdings for which land has to be acquired to satisfy applicants already approved .   8,500.Inaneial. 3.    Section 14 (2) of the Land settlement (Facilities)Act authorised the Treasury to issue to the public Works Loan Commissioners during the financial years 1919-20 and 1920-21, a.sum of  20,000,000 for Land Settlement purposes. Of this amount, 2f millions were allocated by Parliament to the Board of Agriculture for Scotland.   With the con-eurrence of the Treasury, the balance of 17  millions will be sub-divided approximately as followsMinistry&apos;s Farm Settlements .....  1,250,000.Loans to County Councils and Councils of County Boroughs .... 16,000,000 17,250,0004.    Of the sum allocated for loans to Councils in England and v/ales, the amount actually issued by the Public Works Loan Board is at present only  4,466,923, but the Councils have incurred commitments amounting in all to about  12,000,000.   After the most careful investigation by the Ministry&apos;s experts it is clear that the balance of money not already allocated will be insufficient to provide for the whole of the outstanding demand, although it is hoped that most of the applicants already approved may be provided with holdings.
6.    In view of the present financial situation 1 should &quot;be most reluctant to ask for any additional funds, but it is obvious that at the present rate of progress tho time is rapidly approaching when the money already - allocated will be exhausted. ,; 1Time Limit 6.    This being so, it seems extremely undesirable for Appli-      that Councils should continue to accept the demands of pations. ex-service men, which are coming in at the rate of afcout; 1,500 per month in England and Wales.   Once men have beenapproved as suitable they naturally expect to receive a holding in the course of a few months, and it is a miB-taken kindness to all of them to apply if there is no reasonable prospect of satisfying their demand.7.    It is therefore for the Cabinet to consider whether &quot;Councils-should be instructed (i)&quot;ot to accept for consideration under the present scheme any further applications after an early Tspecified) date, and to&apos; issue a notice &quot;to this effeot in the local press, and (ii) not to createany &quot;new holdings for civilian applicants&quot;.The closing date would be about a month after the issue of the instruction.8.    such an instruction would, of course, be vigortu&amp;ly criticised by County Councils, and condemned by ex-service men&apos;s representatives as a whittling down, if not a breach, of the Government&apos;s promise to provide land for those who.served in the War.   In present circumstances, however, no other course seems to be practicable unless further funds be allocated to land settlement.Apportionment 0. With a view to ensuring that the sums still avail -of Available   able are used to the best advantage, I would furtherFund&quot;       propose to allot to each County Council a quota of money, to be fixed after considering the special circumstances of each county, including the number of applicants and the average capital expenditure which is considered necessary in order to provide small holdings in that county.   When this is done, local public opinion would be relied upon to see that each county expended its quota in such a way as to meet the requirements of the maximum number of ex-service men, and the Ministry would frame regulations directed to that end.10.    The present obligation on Councils to expend the v/hole sum available in the two years specified in the Act limits very considerably the Ministry&apos;e liability to effect economies in the acquisition and equipment of the land.Therefore, before the scheme outlined in the previous paragraph could be carried out -it will be essential that thft Cabinet ehall agree that any part of the Fund not actually issued before the 31st March next shall not 1apse: but remain available for a sufficient period to enable Councils to carry out their task.
XI.    If any County Council ohould be of opinion that it -would be unable to eatiofy all ite approved applicants by means of the funde allotted to that county, I would further submit that the list of lta approved applicants should be revised and special preference given to (a) men who depend for their livelihood on securing a holding, and (b) to men who served overeeae.12.    In submitting theee suggestions for the coneidera-tlon of the Cabinet, I feel bound to point out that a serious political isBue is involved, ae any attempt to check the Land Settlement movement will be keenly resented by the Associations of ex-service men and by the County Small Holdings Committees.   It 1b imperative, however, to call a halt if the  20.000,000 originally allocated is to represent the limit of the Governments liability.13. As the situation is becoming increasingly difficult, I feel bound to preee for a very early decision.X off,June, 1920*
