Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.I circulate, without comment of my own, the correspondence below which may beinvite reference to a letter on future of Mesopotamia in &quot; The Nation &quot; of th April.   I do not know who wrote it but it embodies the experience of a thinking official and says some things better than I have done.f live alone in a remote corner of the world, which needs no particularising other than that it was lately part of the Turkish Empire. For the working hours of the day I talk dog-Arabic; I live a good deal in the houses of my sheikhs, and I issue orders on every conceivable subject connected with Government. For practical purposes, indeed, I am the Government: a position often ridiculous and often embarrassing, but remarkably illuminating.To be a governor is, as Sancho proved, hard work. Living alone, however, with no Englishman Avithin reach, there is time to think, and much cause. The affairs of Europe become known to me by means of the weekly &quot; Times,&quot; which doesn&apos;t matter, and &quot;The Nation,&quot; which does ; these, borne by an erratic postman through floods and rivers, arrive more or less irregularly and often wet.That on the strength of the above introduction I should offer any remarks on things Eastern is perhaps impertinent, and still more so that 1 should lay down theories of government. Still, a year ago, I was writing College Essays upon the Will of the People and Natural Law ; reading wdiat I could of the theorists, and theorising in their footsteps.Such is my excuse, for calling attention to two errors, which, in my opinion, make worthless almost everything that has appeared lately in your columns on the subject of the late Turkish Empire. I have read &quot; The Nation &quot; for several years regularly, and I am devoted to it largely because I often disagree with its remedies, and almost always share its ideals. Put you are at present endangering your good influence by countenancing these two errors, which are not familiar to the dweller in civilised countries, and for this reason are inexcusable in those who profess to guide him.The first error is to gloss over the fact that in the long run the success of any Government depends on its power to compel. That in time it may be possible to produce a real democracy I am not disputing, nor yet attempting to discuss in what the force must lie : I merely state the self-evident fact that a Government which cannot get its orders carried out is doomed.Now, sir, the force with which I govern my somewhat unruly subjects consists of 36 thoroughly unreliable native police, yet my orders are always carried out. Why ? Ultimately because the British Army lurks in the background of the local mind; and, although the troops are a long way off and not plentiful, still they are a legend among the natives.You, sir, and your correspondents want to see &quot; national aspirations gratified,&quot; the recognition of the &quot; unity of the Arab race,&quot; the establishment of responsible Arab government, and the absolute prevention of any further additions to the already over-weighted British Empire.   So do I, and it is just for this reason that I want you not to allow this slipshod thinking, and to make it clear, as it has never (to my knowledge) been made clear, that progress on such lines is a matter of extraordinary difficulty, and that theory, alike with history, gives no help in solving a problem which has never yet been attempted.   The problem is, of course, how to provide a native Government with the force required to govern a wild and very mixed race, divided by the bitterest religious hostilities and tribal feuds, and containing in its midst also colonies of fiercely hated Jews and Christians.   Once stated, the problem needs no enlarge-, rnent from me ; that you allow your correspondents to proceed airily in the assump-tion (as you did yourself when discussing the Persian agreement) that if left alone these people could govern themselves and freely employ European advisers, is almost Tolstoyan in its view of human nature. 10 1614     100 6.20^y// Telegram from Civil Commissioner, Bac/lidad, dated lith May 1920.&apos;E. S. M.Letter to the Editor of &quot; The Nation.The Future of Mesopotamia.Sir,
Secondly, and this is purely a question of experience and local knowledge, you do not know the Arab. My own knowledge is very limited, and is mostly confined to the very small district which I know rather intimately. The points that matter in this connection are four : (1) We are dealing with people who have lost all. consciousness of nationality in the political sense, who have from time immemorial been governed by foreigners, and among whom indeed the very word &quot; Arab &quot; is used scornfully.(2) These people are utterly unvocal, like all uneducated masses, and it is impossible to find out at all what they think about government.   We deal with them largely in 1 lie mass, through their sheikhs, and the sheikh&apos;s view of government is an objectionable means of extracting money.   It is a hard fact that to the local taxpayer a native Government means nothing except remission of all taxes; for he at least is not credulous of the ability of a native Government to collect these. (3) Besides the complication of extreme religious bitternesses, the tribal system has produced innumerable disruptions which may be incurable, or if curable will need several generations for the purpose.   The desert tribe is always longing to fall upon the settled cultivating tribe and exact ransom from it; one cultivating tribe is always at loggerheads with the next about water-rights, &amp;C, and so the tale goes on.   Amid all these tiny sub-divisions there is no unifying principle from within, (4) We are working against an overwhelming stream of propaganda.   The people behind this, after making due allowances for mischief-makers, dismissed Turkish employees and foreigners, are sincere enough.   But they are not constructive ; no man can build without bricks, and they at least know enough about the facts I have briefly mentioned to realise that the Arab cannot be ruled at present by himself.   The point, however, rather is that they are all city men, knowing incredibly little of the country districts, and universally distrusted by the tribesmen, who form the vast mass of the population, and who are voiceless.There are many other points, but these are salient. I have been moved to set them out after reading your issue of 17th January, just arrived, containing a letter about Syria, signed Mid-East, an article on Mandates in the Middle East, and more especially some sentences in the article entitled &quot;The Coming of Peace.&quot;Mid-East closes his letter by the suggestion that Abdullah be set up as Amir in Baghdad with a national Government under him. Leaving aside all the incidental difficulties, let us imagine this arrangement working, with European advisers. All the officials would, be corrupt; there is in existence no native army, or even police, and can the knot be cut by giving him a European force to assert his authority ? I do not say this is impossible ; if an Arab Government were set up to-morrow, and it would accept my services, I would try with all my heart to work under it; all I want you to tell your public is that any such arrangement bristles with difficulties and has never yet been even remotely foreshadowed in actual fact since the beginning of history.But with your article on &quot;The Coming of Peace&quot; I have less patience. You wish to see the extension, of cultural autonomy ; my people saw it here five years ago, and we are not anxious to repeat the experiment. During the war there was here an interregnum, after the Turks withdrew and before our occupation became effective. What happened ? On the stretch of 20 miles of river where 1 live, no less than seven different tribes took a toll from every boat that went up or down the river, as it entered the territory of each. This is, quite bjuntly, what cultured &quot; automomy &quot; means to the Arab, namely, the right to strip the foreigner, and the foreigner is the man in the next tribe.I believe that we can build up an Arab Government; I think it is a task of extreme difficulty and profoundly worth attempting; but I am sure that you must, give us time. We shall pay for it by being occasionally murdered, and you at home will have to endure taunts of Imperialism, perfidy, and the like. If you insist on turning us out you will let loose incalculable forces of destruction.Yours, &amp;c,Mull a.[We have never proposed to &quot;set up&quot; an Arab Government &quot;to-morrow.&quot;  Ed., &quot;Nation.&quot;]
