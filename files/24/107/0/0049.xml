This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET. 2&apos;T1 450THE CABINET.FRENCH INTENTIONS REGARDING SYRIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith for the information of my colleagues the above-mentioned paper prepared by the General Staff.W. S. 0.The War Office, 8^ June, 1920.The French Military Attache in London informed the War Office on the 2nd June that the French Government had entered into a formal armistice with Mustapha Kemal, through the agency of Mons. de Caix, and that the French intended to withdraw completely from Cilicia, apparently down to the northern frontier of Syria as agreed at San Remo, with the exception that they intended to maintain a base at Mersina for the present.2. The French Military Attache&quot; also stated that three more battalions were being withdrawn from Constantinople and that upon their arrival the total number of battalions under General Gouraud&apos;s command would be raised to 49, allowing for the inclusion of three more battalions from elsewhere. These would all be concentrated for operations in Syria as soon as Cilicia had been evacuated.3. Later, Colonel Fagalde, Liaison Officer at the War Office, stated that the eventual number of battalions under General Gouraud&apos;s command would be raised to 55, with 26 batteries, 22 squadrons of cavalry and 8 air units. Colonel Fagalde admitted that the French were passing from a political to a purely military pituation in Syria and meant to undertake an organized campaign to impose their will upon the Arabs. General de la Panouse shortly afterwards stated that the French armistice with Mustapha Kemal took effect as from the 30th May and was to remain in force for 20 days, though there was no reason why it should not be further prolonged if found desirable. The French and Turks were taking advantage of the armistice to exchange prisoners.4. The time has clearly arrived to realize that the French intend to make the best terms for themselves with the Turks, which includes refusal to co-operate with General Milne at Constantinople, while they are concentrating in Syria a considerable army, organized into four divisions, though the actual number of battalions will be equivalent to six divisions. It seems probable that they will be able to impose their will upon the Arabs as long as they can maintain a force of this size in Syria, and it should be remembered that they recently^ announced their intention of seizing the Horns Hama railway. When once they have secured their position in Syria, in light of past experience, it seems more than probable that they will utilize this position to foment difficulties between the Arabs and Great Britain, and in this connection it must be remembered that the point was conceded at San Remo that the French should be&apos; permitted to enlist Turks in the Foreign Legion. In fact France will have secured the interior lines in Arabia, and can be trusted to make use of them.5. The above situation calls for very serious consideration of our own position in Palestine. The French policy is anti-Zionist, and apart from French pressure, the Arab, &quot; whose belief is in his eyes,&quot; will inevitably turn from the strong battalions to attack the weak oiies. It will be no use falling back before the French, for if this is done it will merely be to transfer the scene of future trouble from Palestine to Egypt and the Suez Canal, where it would be more difficult to deal with and more dangerous in its effect.A statement of the actual disposition of French troops as known is attached as Appendix A.* According to information received from the French liaison officer, General Gouraud had telegraphed on the 3rd June that Emir Faisul had placed the Aleppo Railway at his disposal for the supply of General De la Motte&apos;s division as from 31st May.(B20/278)   100  6/20  h&amp;s   8305wo
APPENDIX A.1. During March there were 34 French battalions in Syria and Cilicia, of which approximately 17 were in Cilicia and 5. more moving there, the remainder being in Syria. The battalions in Cilicia were organized in 2 complete brigades, i.e., Brigade Gracy and Brigade Querette, plus most of the Brigade Aube. (The brigade being named after the Officer Commanding.)/ According to the latest dispositions, the troops were very widely dispersed. Companies and platoons were distributed regardless of their battalion organization.2. By May another 12 battalions had arrived in Syria, making a combined total for Syria and Cilicia of 46, of which, as far as can be ascertained, three-quarters (34 battalions) were in Cilicia and one-quarter (12 battalions) in Syria. 3 more battalions (2 Algerian battalions and 1 Senegalese battalion) are now to be withdrawn from Constantinople for Syria and 6 Senegalese battalions from the Khine, bringing the combined total to 55 battalions in Syria and Cilicia. These infantry battalions are to be organized with other arms in 4 divisions under the supreme command of General Gouraud.The divisional commanders are Generals Goubeau    ...      ...      ... Alexandretta area,Goybet      ......... Beirut area,Dufieu       ......... Killis area,De la Motte ......, Adana area (for the present),who are all officers of seniority and standing, the last two being considered excellent leaders for the purpose in view.3.
