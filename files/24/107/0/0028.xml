CP. 11428Tills Document io theJ^ojsei^jSI Hi3 3 -: &apos;.m5(P 4484) Fro?n 7*ce?*oy, Foreign Department, (jth June 1920.(Received 7 th, 8 a.m.)697 S. Reference my telegram of 6th June, 203 A. Mussoorie Conference. Allusion in communique to Afghan delegates pressing for assurances regarding policy refers, of course, to Waziristan and to Mahmud Tarsi&apos;s reiterated request for cessation of operations during conversations. Following is brief summary of correspondence which has passed between Dobbs and Tarsi on this subject: On 23rd May Dobbs wrote to Tarsi that as Afghan forces had been withdrawn from Tandisar and Lambabat, lie was ready to resume conversations. Tarsi replied on 24th May asking for a definite promise that operations in Waziristan should be stopped. Dobbs wrote again on 25th May to say that ho hesitated to believe Afghan delegation would abandon conversations on account of British Government being unable to accede to Afghan Governments suggestion regarding Waziristan operations. British troops had not in fact recently been engaged in active operations in Waziristan, but Dobbs could not bind his Government not to resume operations if necessary. If conversations were resumed he would be glad to answer any enquiries about British frontier policy, and in particular to explain intentions of British Government regarding Waziristan.Tarsi sent long reply to this letter on 31st May, and, after much, argument, concluded as follows :  &quot; (11.) I infer that on the part of Wazir tribe nothing in the nature of collective attacks and general fighting occurred (? and that) your Government will in future also suspend military operations during our discussions. In conclusion, you have said that you will be glad to answer in the course of our discussions enquiries which 1 may wish, to make regarding British frontier policy. I, too, will certainly be very glad and thankful to hear just intentions of your Government regarding the various Afghan frontier tribesmen who have always been cause of trouble to British Govern-rnent and of disturbing their friendly relations with Afghan Government. As matter has been satisfactorily settled, members of my delegation are with great pleasure ready to come for official discussions on any day and at any time which may be fixed by you.&quot;To this Dobbs replied on 2nd June that lie was glad to know that Tarsi, after consideration of contents of his letter of 25th May, was ready to resume the con-versations, and added : &quot;(R.) You will, of course, understand that I have not given and&apos; cannot give any undertaking regarding operations in Waziristan.&apos;.&apos;\
