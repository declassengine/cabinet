CONFIDENTIAL.R. 159.Re-opening of Trade Relations with Russia. OPINION01THE LAW OFFICERS OF THE OROV.N.1.     Assuming that the Soviet Government is to ho regarded as the de facto Government of Russia, and that tho gold or goods in question have bean nationalised, requisitioned or confiscated by or under the authority of that Government, we are of opinion that a British subject could not success-fully initiate litigation to obtain possession of gold or goods sent to this Country in any of the cases specified, Tho validity or propriety of the nationalisation, requisition-ing or confiscation oftho gold or goods, being the executive act of a de facto foreign Government., is not a matter into which the- Courts of this Country would, in our opinion, have jurisdiction to inquire9   The remedy, if any, of persons aggrieved is, we think,, exclusively diplomatic and not legal-2.     17e think now(Sgd)   GORDON HEWART*ERNEST Mo POLLOCK,Law Officers Department,4th Juno. 1920.
Questions to be referred to the Law Officers for opinion by the interdepartmental Russian (Trade Commit toe.1 question has arisen in connection with the re-opening *f trading relations with Russia on which tho prime Minister desires to have the views of tho Law Officers as quickly as possible:^foreign trade in Russia is stated by the Representatives of the soviet Government to be entirely in the hands cf their Government.     In ^rder to restart trading operations, the Soviet Government must export from Russia goods or gold *r provide services.     In the course of the revolution, property has been nationalised, requisitioned and confisoated and a considerable number of individuals in Countries outside Prussia have olaims against the Soviet Government or particular authnritio thought to be acting in accordance with instructions received from the soviet Government, ns^woll as against particular persons and firms4     Further, both foreign Governments and individuals have claims against Russia in rospect of loans, bonds, etc. for which the OzarTs Government or earlier revolutionary Governments accepted responsibility.For the purpose of paying for goods in this country, the[Russians may adopt one or more of the following courses :-, (a) They may export identifiable goods, e,g,, precious stones, gold&quot;roubles from the Csarrs Treasury works nf art, etc.,ib) They may&apos;export non-indentifiable goods, e,g., timber grain, flax, eta,(e) They may export either under (a) or (b) or both to neutral countries and in return therefor the neutral financiers may provide sterling credits in London, either to the order of -(i) Soviet Government, (ii) Individual members of the Russian Trade Delegation.fiii) Oontroeoyus Limited (a Limited Company formed by the Russian Co-operative organisation some time ago for the purp^--of facilitating trading operations with Russian Co-operative Societies, and registered in Great Britfam.(iv)   Any other ,person or Corporation, either specially constituted or otherwise.
The observations of the Law Officers are asked for, in particular, on the following questions:-Whether a British subject having claims eould with sucooas initiate litigation to obtain possession of gold or goods sent to this country :-(a)   if he eould establish that the gold or goods had beenhis property in Russia at the time cf the measures ofexpropriation;(t)   if ho could establish that tho gold *r gcod3 wore the produce cf mines or land of which ho had been the cwnor, tut which woro nor produced until after the measures of nationalisation were enforced,(c)    cn tho ground that though ho had no interest in that particular property it constituted a fund to which as a claimant he might&apos; look for tho satisfaction of his claim. Whether a British subject having claims against the soviet Government or against persons or organisations in Russia, could seouro by legal process that securities deposited or credits opened in this country by the Soviet Government or its agents should be transferred to himself or could prevent the use of ouch securities or credits until other claims are determined by the Courts,(Sgd.)
