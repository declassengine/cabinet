UilL f(P 4666) From Viceroy, Uili June 1920.(Received 14th, 10.30 a.rn.)732 S.  Mussoorie Conference. Following from Dobbs, dated 12th. June, No. 71: &quot; We had four hours&apos; conference to-day. , &quot;First part was devoted to Afghan complaints about re-occupation of Lambarbat, regarding which I showed that no pledge whatsoever had been given or implied, and strongly repudiated the charge of breach of faith.&quot;At Tarzi&apos;s request we then discussed Turkish peace terms, leaving other points covered by Tarzi&apos;s latest notes for subsequent discussion. With reference to Turkish terms, first Afghan contention was that holy places of the Hedjaz are not left under , independent Moslem control, that King Husain will not be independent, self-supporting and capable of maintaining dignity in.holy places when they are deprived of connection with the powerful Khalifa, and that the pilgrimage will in the eyes of the Afghan lose all its value. I met these arguments to the best of my ability. Discussion was long and rambling and it was very difficult to keep Afghan delegates to the point. It looks as if questions of the Turkish terms will consume several days.&quot;
