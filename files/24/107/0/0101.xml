CABINET.Civil Aviation;    Proposed Subsidy to Aerial Transport Companies*Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,With reference to the Memorandum circulated by tha Secretary of State for War in regard to tho grant of sub-subsidies to Aorial Transport Companies (CP.1255), I circulate to the Cabinet a copy of a Treasury letter dated 15th June 1920, to the Air Ministry, which represents the views held by me on this subject.(Intd) A.O.Treasury Chambers. Juno 21st, 1920.
400Treasury Chambers,      15th Juno, 1920 r -Sir, , JI have laid before the Lords Commissioners of   His Majesty1 s Treasury your letter of the 26th ultimo (153878/20) transmitting two reports by the kCiiewp Committee on Civil Aviation relative to the need for Government assistance in connection with the development of the industry.The Air Counoil endorse the recommendation of the Majority Report to&apos;grant a modified form of subsidy to aerial transport&apos; companies, operating over approved routes to the extent of 25 per cent of their gross takings and within a maximum sum of  250,000 half of which may be earned in oach of tho financial years 1920-21 and 1921-22, the roquisito expenditure for the current financial year to bo mot from the aggregate of Air Votes.concernedHo figures as to the costs and earnings of the companies;..es/are given in support of this recommendation, nor is there any explana-tion of the basis upon which the percentage grant or the maximum limit have been calculated, while the latter is objected to by two members who sign the Majority Report.Even if My Lords were prepared to accept the principle of sub-sidles uor civil aviation, They would require full information on these points before They could assent to the particular figures 1 suggested,.Their Lordships are however entirely opposed in principle to suoh subsidies.    They are in complete agreement with Air Marshal Sir Hugh Trenchard,s Minority Report, which states the case against them with such cogency and completeness&apos; and My Lords have nothing to add, and They observe that as regards the immediate question of the grant of a subsidy in existing financial conditions he is sup-ported by Lord Inohoape.Their Lordships dosiro to associate Themselves with the view ,       expressod by the Secretary of State in his speech on the introduc-  1 tion of the Air Estimates (Hansard vol.126.column 1629)that &quot;Civil Aviation must fly by itself; tho Government cannot possibly hold it up in the Air&quot;...I am, etcsretary, Air Ministry..
