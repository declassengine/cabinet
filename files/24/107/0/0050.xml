Krassin, either of a trading or any other nature. - These demands are put first in the subjoined list, under Heading A, and are followed by the demands which only the Soviet Government can answer, under Heading B.A. Demands, the carrying out ofivhich the Allied Powers must supervise themselves.(i.) The disarming of the Soviet Labour Armies, and a.guarantee that they should only be used for bond jide labour purposes ; and a further guarantee that they should cease to be controlled by, or to have any connection with, the Soviet Cgmmissariat for War.(ii.) Withdrawal of Bolshevik troops from the Tashkent Merv Askabad area, and the disbandment of the army reported to be forming near Orenburg.(iii.) The dispersal of Bolshevik concentrations which are reported on the Karelian Isthmus, and on various points opposite the Polish front.(iv.) Withdrawal of troops from the Caucasus.(v.) The reduction of the Soviet army to a peace footing to be fixed by the Allies.Note. The best way of satisfying ourselves that the above demands have been carried eut appears to be the despatch of a competent Inter-Allied Commission to Soviet Russia, who would be allowed to visit all the territories concerned, and ensure that the Allied demands had been faithfully executed.^-Demands (or enquiries) which the Soviet Government should be required to answer.(i.) If the Soviet Government professes ignorance of the intentions of their local authorities (i.e., the Revolutionary Committee who executed Admiral Koltchak at Irkutsk in February, 1920, the Naval Commander at Enzeli who demanded the handing over of the Volunteer Fleet, &amp;c), what guarantees can they give that, in future, their subordinate commanders will not again exceed their instructions ?(ii.) Will the Soviet guarantee to stop anti-British propaganda in Afghanistan ?(L20/279)   100   (/20  h&amp;s  8312wo
&apos; , 2   ,-   : /(iii.) How far does the Soviet Government control the actions of the new &quot; Far Eastern Republic &quot; which it is reported has been set up at Verkhne-Udinsk ? Is this Republic absolutely independent of the Soviet Government, and does the Soviet Government agree to recognize this independence, and not interfere with any military agreements between the said Republic and any other foreign power or powers ?(iv.) If Captain Frecheville and Lieutenant Couche have not been tortured.and murdered as reported, where are they? ;;&apos;  V(v,) All British prisoners of war captured in Siberia and elsewhere are to be returned forthwith alive and well; what steps is the Soviet Government taking to carry this out ? -(vi.)
