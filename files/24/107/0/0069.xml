No. 85151, cipher.   D.M.O., 10th June, 1920.Despatched 2000, 10th June, 1920.Part 1. Recent telegrams point to a series of disturbances in different parts of Mesopotamia which appear to be on the increase. Please therefore wire your -appreciation of the general situation, with special reference to the following questions : (a.) Are these disturbances spasmodic or is there any evidence that they are co-ordinated by some central authority, whether such co-ordination must be reckoned with in the future ?(b.) Does your intelligence bear out the views expressed in No. R. 5803 of 15th May from Chief Political Officer that the situation in Mesopotamia is dangerous, and that the coming autumn may usher in a critical period ?Part 2. (c.) Do you anticipate that the security of the lines of communication from Basra to Baghdad is likely to be endangered ? If so, to what extent would you have to draw on your -troops at Baghdad to reopen communications ?(d.) Has the recent transfer of troops to Persia in any way endangered the security of our position in Mesopotamia during the coming autumn ?(e.) Bearing in mind that no tanks nor additional armoured cars are available, do you consider that any part of the reductions foreshadowed in your No. X 8685, 14tb. May, will be possible, or if your anticipated savings will be swallowed up in Persia ?&apos; (/) Do you anticipate having to send any further troops into Persia to carry out the instructions contained in No. 84929 D.M.O. ?Part 3. (g.) What would be the effect on the security of Mesopotamia from a military standpoint of withdrawal from Persia to a position covering railhead ?Ih.) In this case, where would you advocate placing your line of defence ?(i.) Progress made in raising Levies, and their military value as compared, for instance, with the Persian Gendarmerie. Can they yet be counted upon as a definite factor in the reduction of troops ?(j.) Would withdrawal from Mosul to a position covering railhead strengthen or weaken the military position ?(/c.) Do you anticipate any additional liabilities in connection with the security of Anglo-Persian Company&apos;s oil-fields.HI
