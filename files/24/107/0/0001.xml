8ITThis Document is the Prooertv ofBrlta inic ^majesty^yTcovoi^ Secretary prState&quot;lor^Tngiarrcirculate herewith my reply to Mr. Winston ChurcliiH&apos;s letter of the28th May circulated hy him./5&apos;E0 Ft fzE. S. M.3miceIndia Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1, My dear Winston, 1st June 1920.Your letter of 26th May regarding cost of troops in East Persia. As I explained in my letter of 14th April to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, which was among the papers circulated by me to the Cabinet on 23rd April, I am debarred by statute from accepting as a charge against Indian revenues the cost of military operations beyond the frontier of India (other than &quot;normal&quot; charges during the war) and cannot therefore be responsible for the military cost of the Aialleson Mission and the troops ancillary to it. The Cabinet did not dissent from this view, as is, I think, made plain by the paragraph in the minutes of 5th May immediately preceding the recorded &quot; decision &quot; regarding the withdrawal.In any case it is clear that the fact that insufficient funds have been provided in the Army Estimates cannot be a reason for asking my Council to agree to accepting as a charge against Indian revenues expenditureAvhich under statute cannot be borne thereby and expenditure for a force which was not used in Persia for Indian requirements at all.I will ask the Government of India to telegraph a revised estimate of the expenditure which will fall on the Imperial Government during 1920-21 for troops in South and East Persia. In the meantime I can only guess what the figure will be, but I expect it will be in the neighbourhood of four rather than two millions sterling, apart from the expenditure (to be shared between Foreign Office and India Office) on &quot; consular guards &quot; at Meshed and Seistan after completion of the withdrawal. Can your military advisers suggest any steps which could be taken to expedite withdrawal at this season of the year ?I hope to send an official letter to the Treasury shortly on the whole question and will communicate a copy to the War Office.As your letter has been sent to the Cabinet, I am circulating a copy of this also.Yours sincerely,The Right Hon. Ed. S. Montagu.Winston S. Churchill, M.P.i 10  1630     100 6.20
