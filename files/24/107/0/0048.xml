INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CONFF.RmTCE. R I, P 0 R T,During the course of the meeting of the Council of.the League of Nations held in London in February, last,&apos;      . under the Chairmanship of Mr. Balfour, the Council was.&apos; ... informed that the British Government had publicly announced that it would consent to tkke part in an Inter-national Financial Conference with the purpose of studying the international crisis in exchange and the financial situation generally, if that conference were convened by a neutral state or by the League of Nations.   The Council,, having been called upon to consider the matter, decided to take the initiative in oonvening an International Conference, with the object of studying the questions mentioned above.   Ts this end it passed the fallowing resolution,:-Article I.   &quot;The League of Nations will convene an international Conference with a view to   investigating the financial crisis and to discovering means of obviating or attenuating its disastrous consequences.&quot;Article 2. &quot;A Commission consisting of Members of the Council appointed by the Chair-man, is charged with convening the states most concerned to attend this conference, which shall be held at the earliest possible date.&quot;In execution of this resolution,&apos; a Committee of Organ!sation comprising representatives of England, France, Italy and Holland was entrusted with prepara-tions for the Conference.   It decided that the latter should be held in Brussels, towards the middle of the month of May.
That the following countries should be invited tosend delegatesSouth Africa ItalyArgentine JapanAustralia Norway &apos;  \Belgium New Zealand &apos; / &apos; &quot;vBrazil PolandCanada PortugalChile Roumania.

A draft agenda has been prepared by the Committee of Organisation, in agreement with the Secretary-General.
DRAi1!   AGENDA,1.    Opening of the proceedings by the Chairman.2r    Adoption of rules of procedure. , ,&apos; &apos;3.,    Appointment of a committee of Organisation. &apos;4.

Report of the Conference to the Council of the league ofIllations.
It will be noticed that this agenda refers to communications to be obtained from the Allied Go^rnmerrts regarding the questions of Reparation and v/ar Debts.   It would, in fact, appear obvious that ahp study of tho international financial situation presupposes s knowledge of the situation of the Central Empires,&apos; particularly that of Germany, both from the point-Of view of her re-sourcea and from that of her debt, as it results from the Treaty of Versailles.In this connection, it is essential to recall the powers given by the Treaty of Peace to the Reparation Commission constituted under Articles 233 and 234 and Annex 2 of Part VIII, which includes representatives of Great Britain, Belgium, the United States, France and Italy.According to those articles, it is the Separation Commission Which will fix the amount&apos; of the German debt, will consider claims and draw up the schedules of pay-ments, prescribing the time and manner of the entire discharge of the debt, within a period of thirty years from May .1, 1921.   It is not bound by any particular code or rules of law and ia only to be guided by justices equity and good faith.     Its decisions are binding, but it may not cancel any part of the debt without the &apos; authorisation of the vnrious Governments represented on the Commission.,   The extent of its powers clearly demonstrates that i-V is essential to Know the attitude that the Reparation Commission proposes to adopt with regard to the Inter-national Conference.Your Chairman has therefore asked the Chairman of -the Reparation Commission to piece the matter.before the1 \ - -latter and I believe that the Reparation Commission has the subject under consideration.
It was, moreover, equally essential to know the policy that the Allied Governments intend to follow with respect to this Reparation problem, and it seemed to me necessary that the Supreme Council should give our Council full information on the subject. I have asked the french Premier that this question should be considered by the Supreme Council.

It results from the terms of the declaration of Sen Remo, supplemented by interviews given at 3an Remo itself at the time and by statements made by the various Heads of Governments to their respective parliaments, that the Supreme Council gave full attention to the problems before us to-day.

If also results from the declaration of San Remo, that an interview is to take place, between the representatives of the Allied Governments and the Chancellor of the German Reich, in the course of which information is to be requested from the latter respecting the eoonomic and financial situation of the Reich.

But thie does not suffice our present purpose. In order that the Council of the league of Hations may be able to give the Chairman of the Brussels Conference such information and instructions as will enable the Conference to produce fruitful and useful results for everyone concerned, it is essential that the Council of the league should be in possesion of the firm decisions of the Allies, both as regards the German indemnity and the methods of payment and as concerns the present position cf Germany, who has been placed, by the Treaty, under the financial tutelage, of the Reparation Commission. It is only after having heen notified of and having ackhowledged these decisions that the Council of the League Of Nations will be able to put them before the
2 Whitehall gardens, S*W* June 12th 1920.0-7-International. Conference *It is only when the situation has been thus deter-mined that the Conference will be able to contemplate the issue of an international loan based on the liquefying of the German indemnity,, which appears to be a &quot;primary condition of the recovery of international credit.If the Council is of opinion that the conclusions contained in this report should be adopted j, I have the honour to request it to decide that a copy thereof be addressed both to the President of the Supreme Council and to the Chairman of the Reparation Commission, and to ask them for a reply which will enable us to give the Chairman of ihe International Conference the noces-sary instructions for the conduct of the labours of that Conference *
