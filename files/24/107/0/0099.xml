The general position of the industry-may be summarised briefly as follows(a)    The general tendency in recent years has been steadily downward, the falling off in production in the last 25 years having been due to a number of causes, the chief being the fall in the value of the metal in the period 1890/1898, which put a number of mines out of operation, the impoverishment of the mines with increasing depth, the decline in the yield of black tin (I.e. concentrates) per ton of ore crushed, and the increased operating costs (especially for pumping).    Between 1913 and 1919&apos; the average increase In the cost of materials (especially ooal) has been about 129$, and the average increase of wages about 75$.    In 1913 -the price of metallic tin averaged  204 a ton,, and it showed no marked advance until 1917; froX-that time it rose rapidly until it reached  .400 in August 1918, but thereafter the prioe was restricted by the formation of a Buying Committee of the Allies., and it dropped to  330 a ton in November 1918.    Subsequently it fell sharpl/ to  204 a ton in February 1919, but through the remainder of that year and the early months&apos; of 1920 it rose rapidly till It reached  403 a ton on the 1st March 1920; since then there has been a very heavy fall and at the present time the price is about  255.    The mine owners contend that the action of the Government during the latter part of 1913 prevented them from getting the prices whicn they would
otherwise have obtained, and that consequently they were unable to spend money on development work and to accumulate reserves which might have tided theiti over the present difficult period.   It is evident, however, that the period during which they could have got very high prioes but for the Government action was a very short one and in any event they were not worse treated than many other olasses of producers whose selling prioes were controlled during the War.    There is reason to believe that there will be a substantial rise again in the price of tin probably at no distant date, but it is at best doubtful whether the Cornish industry will he in a position to compete with supplies of tin from abroad; it certainly will not be able to do eo from most of the present mines, which to a large extent are worked out, unless successful development work can he carried through.(b)    It is laid down by the Departmental Committee and admitted by the trade that the only hope for the Oomish industry is the discovery of new lodes yielding a much higher percentage of black tin than most of those now being worked; there are two mines whioh have obtained a fresh lease of life in recent years, and are operating successfully, owing to such development work; and improved methods of extracting the black tin from the ore.    The latter, problem is being dealt with by the Tin and Tungsten Research Board with the assistance of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research; and the trade now asks that it may receive Government financial assistance in dealing with the first problem and in carrying out develop-ment work.  There is a considerable body of competent geological and technical opinion which believes that certain mines, particularly in the Oamborne-Redruth area, will be found to be substantial tin producers if developed at a lower lovel than that now being worked,(o)    Certain of the mines have already suspended operations and others have given notice to close down. The chief of these latter is the Dolcoath Mine, one of the largest, employing 682 men.    The number of persons employed in the tin mining industry was in 1918 5,524; the number to-day is estimated at between 4,500 and 5,000. The total number actually employed at mines which have recently closed down, or are about to do so. is probably some 2,500.    There are, of oourse, a much larger number of dependents, and oertain villages are entirely dependent on the industry.    I have received representations from the Cambome Urban Distriot Council with respect to the Dolcoath and Grenville Mines, the only two mines now working in the parish; they employ over 1.000,men, and in both cases notices of closure have been given.    The Gambome Urban District Council state that in their area some 3,000 to 4,000 persons in addition to those&quot; actually employed at the mines will be affected, and it is also stated that whilst a fairly large number of men jnight be &apos; assisted in going abroad or elsewhere for employment in mines, that will not be possible with respect to the larger proportion because of age and other reasons.
4,      Tho specific request of the deputation from the Joint Industrial Council was that the Board of Trade should approach the Development Commission with a request for a grant of  200,000 to ho expended over a period of two yoars on a definite development programmes the grant to he made to the Industrial Council and expended under the supervision of that body on tho understanding that it is not to be advanced to any mines for private profit but only for new development an3&amp; to be repaid by the mines out of any profits  arising through the development carried out by means of this expenditure a &apos; As regards this particular application tore are two observations to be made:-(a) Section 1   of the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act 1909 lays down that tho treasury may, upon the recommondation of the Development Commissioz&amp;might make advances to a Government Department, to a publio Authority or an Association of persons not trading for profit, either by way of grant or by way of loan or partly in one way and partly in tho other and upon such&apos;terms and subject to such conditions as they may think fit, for any of certain specified&apos;purposes (development of agricultural and rural industries,&quot;forestry, reclamation and drainago of land, rural transport, fisheries, etc*) and for any other purpose calculated to promote the eoonomio development of the United Kingdom; but the $ommissioners are advised that these last general words must bo interpreted as covering only purposes cognate to and ojusdom generis with those expressly mentioned,    Aid to.industrial development e.g* mining would therefore appear to be excluded *(b) The proposal that the grant should be made to the Joint Industrial Council and allocated by them under certain conditions as to possible ro-paymcnt is no doubt intended to meet the point that the Dovolopment Commission may not make grants to undertakings trading for profit, but I am doubtful if the proposal made by tho Joint Industrial Council overcomes this difficulty, and in any event I do not think the Joint Industrial Council is the right body to be entrusted with tho allocation of funds for the purposes now proposed *1   Some of. the&apos; development schemes which tboy suggest are, I am advised, open to considerablo criticism;     If financial assistance is to be given at all- it should, I think, be through the Board of Trade and only after very careful investigation of individual schemes,. The Departmental Committee have recommended that tho existing ilineraj Honourcos Department of tho Board of Trade should be expanded and provided with a sufficient staff to&apos;enable it to keep in close touch with metalliferous mining, to offer advice in regard to tho improvement of existing methods and to advise as to Government action in appropriate casos; that power should be taken to extend financial assistance.. on the advice of that Department to mining Companies to enablethem/
3 91)to tide over their difficulties or to undertake approved ,  exploration and development; and that the funds at the disposal of the Development Commissioners should he made available for this purpose.5*   ffiae fundamental question is one of general policy.    However optimistio the technical experts may he, mining development work is at test uncertain and Speculative; and I must point out that in this particular eaae the mining companies declare that they are. not in a position to find any money for development nurposes themselves or to obtain it in the ordinary way.    Secondly,&quot;unless the develop-ment scheme yields results far beyond pre sen v ar-jceotationa the Cornish tin industry is unlikely to be&quot; in a position to produce more than a relatively small part of the United Kingdomrs requirements of metallio tin,    tether there are demands being made for State assistance for the lead and zinc mining industry and for certain wolfram minas, and if the principle of State assistance be established for the tin mining industry it would be very difficult to refuse to extend it to these other branches of mining,     Cn the other hand once the. mines are shut down it is most unlikely that they will ever be brought into operation again., owing to the difficulty and cost of de-watering; and the shutting down of the mines&apos;will thus bring to an end the oldest mining industry of Great Britain, will deprive us of a useful -though net a large contribution to our supplies of an important metal, and will undoubtedly cause very considerable unemployment and distress it? the areas specially concerned,    nevertheless, on a balance df all the considerations, I am unable to recommend that any measure, of State financial assistance should be given,6,   (die matter is one of very considerable urgency as mines are closing down rapidly, and if they are to be kept alive by State financial assistance, a decision to that effect must be taken and communicated to the. industry forthwith.7,   I have, also received an application for State assistance to the&apos;Hemerdon Mines. ltd. of. Plimpton, Devonshire which ware developed during the war for the production of. Wolfram, which is the ore of tungsten,     The Company was formed and the Homerdon deposit acquired early in 1917 by a Scottish group under the Chairmanship of Sir John Oargill, at a time when the Ministry of Munitions was making every effort to secure an increased production of Wolfram in the United Kingdom,&apos;   The Company lias expended its entire cash capital of  61,500 and a sum of  SOs000 lent by the Chairman without security, and, in addition, about . 14,500 in fully-paid shares issued to the discoverers of the ora deposit.    It is fully equipped with ore-crushing and mineral-concentrating plant but there has been no pro-auction as the. eauipmant was only just being completed at the time of the Armistice &quot;and the cessation of the Ministry of Munitions1 purchases of Wolfram and the a ale of their accumulated stocks brought Wolfram down rapidly to a price which was only one-half of that paid by the Ministry during the war, and at the reduced price the Company wsre unable to produce except at a loss,     The Company contend that the ore deposit is&apos;the largest in the West of England and the present plant will give an output of Wolfram greater than that af all other&apos; Wolfram-producing mines, in G-rsat Britain put together, (They urge that it is most important taat the British Wolfram produc-,tion should be maintained and that their undertaking, was established to help to meet the Iationvs needs during the war and its original scheme was expanded largely at the suggestion of the Ministry of MunLtSoiff they are reasonably, entitled to some financial assistance from the
Government^    They have made various alternative suggestions as to -Government &quot;assistance such as a guarantee of interest on capital, the grant of a bounty on production and the taking over by tte Government of &quot;the undertaking on an expert valuation or, alternatively, at a price sufficient to repay tho capital expended with interest at8c    The World!s production of Wolfram in 1914 was about 7,400 tons, the United Kingdom5s share being cs&amp;y 305 toast by .1913 the World&apos;s production had risen to some     GOO&apos;tons but ths United Kingdom8s output had Increased to only&apos;302 tons     the ehiaf protooiag countries are China, the United States. Butwh$ Bolivia a&amp;d  ortugalo There is a small production In Australia,.. laaxtean output of the  Kemordon Mine Is pr obably. scmo 500 to 350 tous*    &apos;iTb* case of this particular mine was considered by the Departmo ntal * .Committee who reported thatj- . ;&quot;There is very little reason to doubt that tho demand, for Wolfram&apos;will revive and: eventually the prleeV which is Sown to the pre-war level,&quot;will reach a higher figureo    In the meantime the mine is close&amp;o    $orttihately, the workings being shallow, the mine is not troubled with the drainage problem and the dressing plant is well^used so that the. rate of deterioration is smalls    We sympathi.se with the company in this tmfortunate . z*suit,.of their patriotic effort to meet a war demandj but--m think the only solution of tine difficulty: is to wait for an improved market for Wolfram and regretfully report, that we cannot recommend any.course of action&apos; which would enefcXo tba mine to resume,its operations earlie^9*.   I feel that it would be difficult for tho Government. to supports venture that holds out so little rUJ^Xlhood of commercial  -suocssBc    The margin of. difference betyreen the octets of pr eduction at...Wolfram mines in this country &amp;M in China and .Bannah is very l&amp;rf&amp;i there is small hope of reducing it* and State assistance could hardly be limited to &quot;this particular&apos; casso    I therefore recommend that the application of the Company be refused but in view of the importance of Tungsten as an&apos;alloy in High Sp$e&amp; Steel and the great demand for it during the war,. I.have thought proper- to bring the case to the attention of my colleagues,19th June, 1920,E, S* horne.
