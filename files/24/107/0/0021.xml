TkAi^LATIOli. ---PROVISIONAL AiiSY/Ehb TO QUESTIONS ItAISED BY THE HEAD OF THE BhITISH GOTOtMUKNffi AT A CONFERENCE HELD OH I.IAY 31st, 1920.Questions which have had to be referred to other Authority and to which no reply has yet been received, (subject to amplification.)The questions put to me at tho Conference of tho 31st May-by the head of the British Government, are either of a political nature, or of such a nature that they are subject to the removal of certain obstacles on which the present hostile activities between Soviet Russia and the British Government has a distinct bearing.I have the honour to state that, owing to the above-mentioned character of these questions, it is impossible for me to give to all of them an immediate and exhaustive reply, as I am not sufficiently in touch with diplomatic and political affairs and am not empowered to answer them singly.I wish to express regret for the fact that the plenipoten-tiary representative of the National Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, Litvinoff, did not receive permission to come to London, as his presence at the Conference would have greatly facilitated and hastened the clearing up of the questions raised by tho British Government.)Those questions which are outside my sphere, as I am not the representative of the National Uommissariat for Foreign Affairs, and, therefore, cannot give them an immediate answer, I have referred to my Government and its representative at Copenhagen, M. Litvinoff.   When I am furnished with the necessary particulars, I will lay them before the British
- 2 - n &quot;   .Government.As to the other questions raised, I can at the present moment give the following answers(1)   Touching on the release of 3ritish subjects at present in Soviet Russia.On this question there already exists a formal agreement of the 18th February, 1920, made at Copenhagen between the Minister plenipotentiary of the Rational Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, Litvinoff, and the representative of the British Government, Mr. 0&apos;Grady.To the best of my knowledge this agreement is being carried out in toto by the soviet Government.   I will -furnish further particulars on this subject on receipt of them from either MoLitvinoff, or Moscow.   Bearing on this question, I have the honour to state, that from information in my possession, there are a number of Russians at present in England who, despite the agreement made between H.Litvinoff and Mr, 0&apos;Grady, have not had the consent of the British Government to leave England,,   prisoners in Belgium have not been repatriated, and also our comrades from India, concerning the repatriation of whom an undertaking made by the British Government is in existence.It is imperative for the re-establishment of normal relations that this agreement made by Mr. 0&apos;Grady with M. Litvinoff in the namo of the British Government should not remain a paper docu-ment but should be carried out by the British Government in the-same manner as the soviet Government is carrying out its side of it as regards British subjects at present in Russia.(2)   On the question of anti-English propaganda by the Soviet Government in the East, I have the honour to state;-Following several open acts of war by the 3ritish land and sea forces who attacked Soviet Russia, inflicting losses on Russian peasants and workmen, the soviet Government was obliged from motives of self-protection to safeguard itself from these
- o -attacks, for which neither the Soviet Government nor the Russian people had given any cause, &quot;by employing all means in their power which would help them to combat the aggressive policy of the British Government as regards Soviet Russia.   The complete cessation of whatever means and methods are at present being employed in the East against the British Government entirely depends on the future line of action of the British Government.If Great Britain is prepared to give actual guarantees of her peaceful intentions as regards Soviet Russia, and if the British Government is prepared to refuse all further help to the enemies of Soviet Russia, she, in her turn, is prepared to furnish full guarantees from participation in or connivance at any kind of hostile action, not only in the East but elsewhere.(3)   Prom information in my possession no threatening attitude between Georgia and Soviet Russia is in existence, and the relations between the Georgian Republic and Soviet Russia are entirely friendly.(4)   I am unaware of any kind of assistance being rendered to Turkish nationalists by the Soviet Government, and I have asked tho people1s Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Tchitcherin, and his representative, litvinoff, for full particulars on the subject. Any further information on the subject I will furnish on receipt of their replies.(5)   In the event of pourparlers reaching complete agreo-ment, the Government of the Russian Socialistic and Federal Soviet Republic is prepared to give an official undertaking, on any lines which the British Government may desire, not to carry on propaganda in Great Britain.(6)   The forces of Wrangel, which, with the help of armed forces of the British Government, are holding out in the Crimea, consist of the remnants of Ponikin&apos;s Army, which have boon decimated by the Red Army, and is looked upon by tho Russian peasants and workmen as a gang of mutineers, who are relying on
foreign aid and are carrying on a fruitless struggle, a struggle, which only causes increased bloodshed, against the Russian people and their lawful Government,   If&apos;Jrungel&apos;o forces agree to capitulate and hand over in good condition their arms, munitions of war and all private property in their possession, then it is probable the Soviet Government will not refuse such a capitulation.   In fact, discussions on these lines are already in progress.(7)   The Soviet Government does not intend to undertake any attacks in the Baltic Sea.   The soviet Government would welcome a complete disarmament in all waters and will resort to this means, when it is recognised by all other powers.For the resumption of complete peace in the Baltic, it is essential that Finland should moot the peace proposals of the Soviet Government, and that all warships belonging to powers who do not possess territory bordering the Baltic coast, be removed from these waters.   The same applies to the Black sea(0)   The Soviet Government is in complete friendly relations with the Persian Government, and any protest, relating to any broach, if coming from tho Persian Government, will bo immediately looked into by the Soviet Government with a desire to promote good faitbu5/6/20.
