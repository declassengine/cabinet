This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.;   2276THE CABINET.REFUGEE CAMP AT BAQUBAH IN MESOPOTAMIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR!I circulate herewith a short note showing the present situation relative to the Assyrian and Armenian refugees in Mesopotamia. We are spending about two millions a year on these interesting people, and the cost is, for some strange reason, borne by the Army Estimates.w. s. c.The War Office,ISth June, 1920.01525262Refugees in Mesopotamia-.   Situation, 11th June, 1920. Baqubah camp contains : (a.) 26,000 Assyrians. (b.) 14,000 Armenians.   .It is understood that the 1,399 Russian internees from the Volunteer Fleet at Enzeli are also on their way there.With regard to the Armenians. The only reduction possible in the near future is 372, who wish to go to Constantinople.   Steps are being taken to effect this.&apos;With regard to the Assyrians. The repatriation had commenced last month to an area north of Rowanduz and astride the Turko-Persian borderland the refugees had reached an advanced base between Mosul and Aqra. Progress was delayed by the necessity for arming them. Issue of rifles was agreed to at the end of May, but meanwhile Persia had lodged a protest against the entry of these people, although a large number are Persian subjects, and all were fully armed when they left Persia two years ago.Now, from a wire from Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, dated 7th June, it would appear that the British are contemplating withdrawal from Zakho, Dohuk and Aqra. In this case the Civil Commissioner thinks repatriation would probably be impossible. ^Confirmation is being asked, for, and General Haldane has been asked for his opinion. His reply is printed below, and shows that the Assyrians want guns as well as rifles before they will proceed with the move.From General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, to War Office.Priority A. Handed in 10th June, 1920, 1045.(No. X 8977, cipher.) (Received 2020.)My No. X 8937, of 7th June.L. Please (?) read correspondence ending with your (?) telegram No. 84978, M.O. 2, 28th May, regarding issue of arms to Assyrian refugees.2. Situation in the Mosul vilayet is such that it is imperative that the Assyrians . should go on at once or return.   Their return now would prevent repatriation in the future.   They will not go on without guns and rifles asked for.    Please see Civil Commissioners No. 5186, of 28th April, to India Office.3. It is requested that an immediate decision may be given regarding former.(B20/282)   100  6/20  H&amp;s  8316wo
