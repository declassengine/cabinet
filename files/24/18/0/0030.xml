Report  for Week  ending Wednesday, June  27,  1917.                         PART I.-ACTION  TAKEN.                                 ORGANISATION.  -      &quot;.              y:V :    Lord Rhondda, with the  consent  of  the Army Council, has appointed Mr. U. F.Wintour, C.B., C.M.G., Director of Army Contracts, to be Permanent Secretary to theMinistry of Food, vice Sir Henry Rew,  K.C.B., who has resigned.that appointment.    It was officially announced on 26th June that Lord Rhondda had  decided.to setup a Costing Department in the  Ministry of Food, consisting of skilled  accountants,with powers to examine books for the purpose of enabling him to determine the costsof production and handling.   It was further stated that the object of control would beto fix prices  by reference to actual costs with the addition of the normal pre-war rateof profit, independent of market fluctuations, in the manner which has already enabledthe Army authorities to purchase many  of their essential supplies at prices considerablybelow the market prices ruling for civil consumption.                      . , CONTROL OF  SUPPLIES AND  PRICES.  ,;                ,    Export.of Foodstuffs from America. In reply to a message asking what progresswas being made with reference to the. constitution and arrangement of the Allied Food&apos;Board,  Mr.  Hoover  cabled - that no  further&apos; progress  could  be  effected until  theAmerican Food Legislation had been passed.  A further inquiry as-.-to the attitudeof the Food Administration in America towards the House prohibition clause  and thelikelihood of acceptance by the Senate, of this clause, was  answered to the effect thatin view  of the transcendent importance of other issues-in the Food Bill the-Food.&quot;Administration intended to express no views whatever on the prohibition question, inorder to avoid, the making of enemies, on either side, and that some modification of theHouse clause was expected in the Senate.              &apos;        &apos; :    - -         -    Sugar. During the past week,  the loss of sugar  by enemy action has beenlimited to a consignment of some 1,000 tons on board a vessel carrying a general cargo.     As a result of correspondence with the Ministry of  Shipping, and of personalconference with the  Controller  of Shipping, arrangements have. been made for theallocation of additional tonnage for early shipments, which will&apos;go far to  mitigate thevery critical position stated in last week&apos;s report as.being likely to arise in the courseof the month of August.                      -&apos;.     .. - . .                 ....     On Thursday, June 21, Lord Rhondda  received a deputation from the Newcastleand Stockton Co-operative Society on the subject of the distribution of sugar.    :  &apos;. -&apos;.    Flour Mills Control. It  was considered advisable  that  a  fixed price  should. be.made for screenings removed by millers in the process of cleaning wheat, as caseshad been brought to the notice of the Committee in which millers were defeating  theobjects of the Flour and Bread Orders  by removing    excess quantityof screenings,which they were able  to sell at a price  in excess of the cost of wheat.  It was decided,accordingly, to fix a price not more than 15Z. per ton net weight at the mill door.    The question of the variation in  the colour of bread and  flour due to importedwhite  flour  nv private hands  was referred  to, and it  was  stated by the  WheatCommission that the amount of this imported white flour in private hands is likely tocome to an end at an early date, and in future all imported flour will be in  the handsof the Wheat Commission and they will not permit it  to be sold without restriction.     Tea.- On  Monday, June 25,  Lord Rhondda  received a deputation from  theWholesale Co-operative Society, who criticised certain points in the proposed schemefor selling tea in A, B, C, and D classes.  In order to allow time for the revision ofthe  proposed arrangements the public auctions  of Indian tea  have been  furtherpostponed.

2    . Provisions.-The trouble caused by the recent glut of Danish, &quot;bacon has lessened,owing to the cooler weather and the slackening.of supplies.  &quot;The.bulk of the Americanand Canadian  hog products now i being imported are being  stored for future con-sumption.  -     Canadian  and American  cheese are  no  longer  quoted, as all imported cheeseis now taken over by the Board of &quot;Trade.   Cheddar and Cheshire cheese were reducedat the last revision by 4s. and 6s.  per cwt., and other marks of English cheese werelowered in sympathy.  There is a glut of Dutch cheese at present in the country.     Excessive Profits. On Friday, June 22, Lord Rhondda reeceived a deputation ofLondon Unionist Members of Parliament  on  the  subject of high  prices and undueprofits, and later in the same day a further deputation of the War Workers EmergencyCommittee  on  the same subject. . The retailing  of  Australian and  New  Zealandmutton and lamb at a profit  of 75 per cent, on the wholesale price continues to be thesubject of questions in the House  of.Commons. :                      .. -   FOOD&apos;ECONOMY  CAMPAIGN.      .    - The  Chairman  of  the  National War Savings  Committee has informed  LordRhondda that, subject to his approval, it  is  proposed to  terminate  on  the 14th Julythe Food Economy Campaign instituted  in March last at Lord Devonporfs request.A considerable  measure  of success has been achieved by the efforts  of  the local WarSavings Committees, and it is  claimed that, adverse conditions notwithstanding, theyhave succeeded in reducing the consumption of bread by 10 per cent.                           ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS.         ;     ...     Local Authorities1 Powers. A conference, was held with representatives of theHome Office, the Local Government Board, the  Scottish Office, and a member of thePubhc Control Department of the London County Council to discuss the question ofoverlapping of  authorities  concerned in  the enforcement  of  the  Food Controllersorders.  It was decided  that the Home Office should address Chief Constables on thesubject in the first instance.     Prosecutions. Two  Bedford  farmers  were prosecuted at the request of this *Ministry for  selling potatoes  at  illegal prices, and  fines amounting  to 2251.  wereimposed by the  Biggleswade  Bench.                                       &apos; -. -.     A farmer was convicted under the WJieat, Rye, and Rice (Restriction) Order, 1917,on the ground  that a rick  of  wheat  gathered  in 1915 and not threshed had beendamaged by rats, mice, and birds.  He was fined 51., and  began threshing  the wheaton the same day.                            -     A number  of convictions have been obtained in  London for selling new bread,the fines varying from 10s. to 201.   At the Old Street Petty Sessions fines amountingto 92Z. were imposed on Jewish bakers of the East End for this offence.     .:&apos;. .     Reports show that local authorities generally are prosecuting for offenCes underthe Oat and Maize Products (Retail Prices) Order, 1917, and the Beans&apos;, Peas and Pulse(Retail  Prices)  Order, 1917.  The defence is usually either .ignorance of the FoodController^ Orders or a plea that  the&apos;price charged by the wholesale seller is such. as.to make illegal  Charges by the retailer inevitable.   The plea is not usually successful.     Cases of hoarding are constantly reported  to the Ministry directly and  throughthe  National War Savings Committee.    The -War  Savings  Committee  themselvesreceive a very much larger number and only  forward  to this Ministry  those  where aprima facie case  seems established.   Even among those so forwarded a considerablenumber break  down on investigation.    Where, however, proceedings, have been.instituted a conviction has generally been obtained. &quot;     The Food (Conditions of Sale) Order is now being better observed, but prosecu-tions still continue.  An assistant in  an  East  Sheen branch of  the  International TeaStores was prosecuted at the instance of the Ministry and fined 21. with 3L 3s. costs. .
PART II-SUMMARY  OF FOOD POSITION.  &quot;   &apos;    :  &apos;-    &apos;      &apos;     -IMPORTS. .       &quot;&apos;./.&apos;..--..&apos;;      &quot;.&apos;..--  ,    Imports  of food in the week ended  23rd J une, though  much less than in thepreceding week, when the total was- exceptionally large, were above the average forthe 25 weeks since the beginning of the year, the  total quantity of the. principal foodsand feeding-stuffs received, as shown in Table A, being-220,000 tons, compared withnearly 311,000 tons in the previous week, 232,000. tons in the corresponding weekof 1916, and a weekly average for this  year of 212,000 tons. ; For the three completedweeks of  June, the average. weekly importation is much the same.as in May, andconsiderably greater than in April or March.    . The imports of wheat and  wheaten flour were maintained at a high level, thoseof wheat amounting to 147,000 tons, compared with 100,000 tons in the correspondingweek of 1916, and a weekly average, in 1917. of nearly 104,000  tons,  and those offlour being 14,800 tons, compared with 10,000 tons a year ago and.an average, thisyear, of 9,700 tons.  On the other hand, the imports of.&quot;maize were again very small(4,500 tons, compared with 19,600 tons in the corresponding week of 1916 and aweekly  average  of 31,500 tons  this  year), and  those  of  barley fell to 4,700 tons,against an average of 8,000 tons this  year.  The imports  of oats, though above  theaverage for previous weeks of 1917, were also much less than in the correspondingweek of 1916.     .    --i  -  .    --:&apos;&apos;-- &quot;-: :  The imports of beef,. mutton, bacon, hams, lard, and butter, were  all relativelylow, in  comparison alike with the preceding week, earlier weeks of  1917,  or  thecorresponding week of 1916 ; but the recent improvement in the supplies of margarinewas substantially maintained, and the imports of cheese were satisfactory.   - The quantity of sugar received, though up to this year&apos;s average, was much, lessthan in either the previous week or the corresponding week of  last year.    The total imports, since the. beginning of the year, of fifteen of the principalfoods and  feeding-stuffs for which figures are available now amount to 5,297,500 tons,compared  with 5,864,000 tons in tlie related period of last year, showing a reductionof 566,500  tons, or nearly 30. per cent.   The  articles mainly responsible for  thedecrease - are sugar (214,000 tons), barley (202,000 tons), wheat (124,000 tons), and oats(.141,000 tons).-  The imports of  whealen  flour, beef, mutton, Lams, and margarineare also considerably below those for the corresponding period of last year; but theimports of maize are greater by 168,000 tons, and there  are also substantial increasesin cheese,  butter, and glucose.  The totals  for bacon and lard show little change fromthose for last year.     &apos; .--                             -       -&apos;.    .       :              -.    CONSUMPTION OF MEAT..         - V.    The supplies of dead meat entering the markets at London, Manchester, Liverpool,.and Glasgow (Table B),  showed a further marked reduction in the week ended 16thJune, the  total for all the four markets being 15J per cent.&apos; below that for the previousweek, 11 percent, below, the weekly  average, for  May, and  19 per cent, below thetotal for the corresponding week in 1916.   .               &apos;&quot;.    Although at each market the  figures&apos; showed a decrease compared with, those forthe preceding week or  with&quot; the average  for May, the  reduction as compared with ayear ago is  due  almost entirely  to a  heavy fall, (nearly 24 per cent.) in London.  AtManchester the  reduction  was only .5 - per cent.,  and&apos;at Liverpool and Glasgow there.were increases &quot;of 3 per cent,  and 8 per cent, respectively.    &quot;&apos;; &apos;    In the week ended 23rd  June, the supplies in  London were  greater than in theprevious week,  but were  still. slightly below the average for  May, and  were 11^ percent, below those of the corresponding week in 1916.    The supplies of fat stock received at  51 markets  during the week ended 20thJune also  showed some reduction, in the aggregate, on those of previous years.  Thereduction  was much smaller, however, than that recorded above for dead meat, andthere was  an increase as compared with, the supplies of the previous week.    The supplies of fat cattle were 14 per  cent, greater  than  in the previous weekwhen they were exceptionally small, but 12 per cent, below the average for May.  Ascompared  with the average  for  the corresponding weeks of  1914-16,  they showedlittle change.  The increase which was noted last week  in the supplies of fat sheepcontinued, the numbers received  at the 51  markets being 13 per cent, above the verylow average for May.   Even this increased  supply, however, Avas less by 15 per cent.
than the average for the corresponding, weeks of 1914-16.  The/supply of fat pigswas  10 per cent.- greater  than in the preceding week and &apos;7 per. cent,  above the1914-16 average.  For previous weeks of this year, the supplies of fat pigs have beenconsiderably below those for 1914-16. &apos;            :  :         ;&apos;.*     ;STOCKS;OF CEREALS.   &apos;.        -                  &apos;  .&apos;     Wheat. The stocks of wheat (including flour expressed as wheat), at 25th. Juneare estimated  to have amounted to -1,301,000 tons, compared  with 1,242,000 tons at18th June, 1,128,000 tons  at 1st June, and 1,435,000 tons a year ago;   .      ...     Barley.-.

Oats.-The stocks  at  25th June  are estimated at 194,000  tons,  compared with227,000 tons at 18th June and 302,000- tons at 1st June.&quot;               ...  A&apos;.   -  Maize.-The stocks at 25th June are  estimated at 85,000  tons,  compared with115,000 tons at 18th June and 156,000 tons at 1st June.- .  -                           WHOLESALE PRICES.           .&apos;             -/&apos;&apos;  ;    The principal changes, since the  previous  week, shown by  the. latest availablewholesale prices of  food  and feeding-stuffs,  as given  in  Table C,&apos; are  furtherdecreases of 10s. 6d. per cwt. in English mutton and of  3s. 6d per cwt. in &quot;Canadianbacon and Irish butter, and  increases of  7s. 6o\ per cwt. in Argentine chilled: beef,5s. per cwt. in English Cheddar (new) cheese, and 3s; per  cwt. in  English beef.There were  also smaller increases  in the prices of New Zealand butter and  Danishbacon and a reduction of Is. 6d. per cwt. in country &quot; straight run &quot; flour.   The pricesof other articles showed little or no change.        -  .    As compared with a month ago, the  principal changes in  prices are  mostly in adownward direction.  The most marked reductions are in Danish bacon (22s. per cwt.),&apos;Canadian bacon (17s. per cwt.), English mutton (14s. per cwt.), New Zealand- butter(14-s. per cwt), Irish butter (9s. 6d\ per cwt,), and Danish butter (3s, per cwt.).  Theprincipal  increases are in English beef  (15s.. Qd. per cwt.) and sugar (4 s. A^d. toto 6s. l\d. per cwt.).  The  &quot; Gazette &quot; average price for British barley shows a rise of-10s. 3cZ. per quarter, but this is.  due  to the inclusion within the average of an increasedproportion of kiln-dried barley,  the price of  which is relatively  high, and not to a rise.in the selling-price of grain of the same quality.,. .    With the exception of Argentine mutton, the price of which is approximately at thesame level, every article included in the Table shows an increase in price as comparedwith a year ago.  The rise  is greatest in the case  of palm-kernel cake  (168s. per ton,or 107  per  cent.), British  oats (23s. lid.  per 312 lbs., or 77 per cent.), Plate maize(32s. 6o\ per 480 lbs., or 76 per cent.), linseed  cake (170s. per ton, or 67  per cent.),.Calcutta linseed (239s. per ton,  or 66 per  cent.), British wheat (30s. Id. per 480 lbs.,or 64 per  cent.), Canadian  cheese (61s. per cwt.,&apos;or 61  per cent.), rice (10s.  3d.&apos; percwt., or 56  per cent.), London  (town-made) flour (20s. &quot;per 280-lb. sack,  or 48 percent.), and Egyptian cotton-seed (110s. per ton, or 41  per cent.). &apos; English beef andmutton, Argentine chilled beef, Irish  bacon, and Canadian bacon, show increases of26 to 34 per cent.                                &apos;.   &apos;  &apos;.&apos;    The smallest increases are in Danish  bacon&apos;  (3 per cent.), sugar&apos;(12  to  14 percent.), and butter (New Zealand 13 per cent., Danish  .17 per cent., and Irish 21 percent.).                      &apos;                                              -  -
