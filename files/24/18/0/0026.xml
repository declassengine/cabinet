JONES.-&apos;ICT. 8796.DEPARTMENT OP INFORMATION,   Intelligence Bureau,       82, Victoria Street,S.W.1,With reference to the Memorandum&apos;onRussian Finance issued yesterday &quot;bythis Bureau,  it is particularly re-quested that  it he treated  as  a&quot;Secret&quot; paper.It should have been added that a millioroubles is  approximately equivalent,at the present rate of exchange to 48,000.Two copies  of this Memorandum  havebeen sent to  the Treasury.30.6.17
Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.C.3.Memorandum on the      PRESENT FINANCIAL SITUATION OF RUSSIA.     The following data are based on three personal conversationswith Messrs Tereschenko, formerly Minister of Finance, and Shingarev,present Minister of Finance, during May 14-21, 1917.mhe^e-gentiemen stated:-     Our ordinary budget for 1916 ehowed 940 million roubles ofsurplus over the estimates.    This, however, is a purely illusoryresult.  A certain sum was budgetted each year for the Ministryof TfJar, but in July 1914 a special separate War budget wasinstituted, so that estimates and expenditure under that account nolonger appeared in the ordinary budget, with the above results in1916.   Fifteen and a half milliards (billions) of Treasury Billshave been raised in the country constituting a fixed debt, and tenmilliards of paper money Is in issue by the Government Bank, n^neof theme; roughly, since the war.     The present situation is that we have a debt of 40 milliardsof whioh 6 milliards is owed abroad.  Of this sum, 33 milliardsconstitutes our war debt.  Our war expenditure is now lh milliardsper month.  By January 1, 1918, we estimate that our debt willamount to 55 milliards.  Yte can also foresee very heavy expenditurein connection with the liquidation of the war, demobilisation,reconstruction of towns and villages.     Our normal budget is composed of 3 essential elements:-(1) Expenses which have, and must.still, increase in connectionwith the cultural and productive development of our country;(2) 2-1 milliards of interest on our debts;  (3) The Militarybudget.   How can we cover this?   The most unproductive methodis to make fresh loans:  this would mean ruination to the country.
Therefore we follow England in the line of financial reform.     (1) In connection with direct taxation.  By this method thegreatest part vill have to be raised.   Our income tax must bedeveloped.  Formerly it commenced at 850 roubles?&apos; we propose nowto make it commence at 1200 roubles,partly owing to the depreciationof the rouble, and partly to the difficulty In collection.   T7e areconsidering measures for other direct taxes, e.g. personal propertytax.  \.e are particularly working out a scheme for a tax on theincrease in value of property:  this we think has great fiscalimportance because it will tend to make people give a true declarationas to the value of their property in the first instance.  We alsopropose to institute direct taxes on legacies.  We propose to followthe English scheme, but to make the taxes heavier than yours, thoughonly for the period of the war.  We can increase and diminish directtaxation as occasion requires;  this gives a possibility of equity -in taxation.  Personally I (Tereschenko) am against heightening andintroduction of  new indirect taxes, as also&apos;against fiscal monopolies,(I took up this  last point in more detail in connection with sugar,of which he Is a manufacturer.  J.Y.S.).     (2) The second method of covering our future budgets is bygranting credit  for productive operations - the granting of long-time credit to electric and other industries,  obligations on rail-ways, but not to cover interest in connection with them, only forproductive work.     (3) The third method is by change in our export balance.  Thisis net the matter of a day.   We hope to be able to take over into thehands of the State many export operations, particularly incommodities in which we used to trade with the Allies,  e.g.  timberand grain.  The  productive power of our country has never beenutilised to any  considerable extent.   T,;e  must  consider  very muchmost in the way  of exchange  with the Allies.
  A                                                              73                             3.      To these  data Mr Shingarev added the facts of the extreme gravity of the financial  situation owing to the enormous increased demands on every hand.  The  pay of the soldiers has been raised from 75 kopecks a month to 7-J roubles in the case of men at the front,  and 5 roubles  in the  case of those living at the rear. This item will now represent a  sum of 800 million.  The expenditure of the  State was  increasing  daily while the revenue had fallen off-badly &apos;since the Revolution.                                                  J.!t.S.                                                    29.6.17.&apos;  R
