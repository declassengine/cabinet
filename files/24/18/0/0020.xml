Collection  of  Statistics  and Returns  relating:  to Agriculture^     1 *  Cen3U8 of iLive, Stock and  Implements:          The tabulation of  the more  important  items &apos; in  the  list     of  implements  is  now proceeding.     2*  Annual Agricultural  Returns;          The schedules of returns  are  now being  received  daily and     it  is expected that the arrangements  made  for  tabulation will   .  ensure the  possibility  of issuing  a provisional  statement of     the returns at an early date.III.  Reoruiting  in  Agriculture:     1.  Military Service Act 1916:          The Army  Council have  agreed  that  in  Scotland  any  person     certified by the  Board  to be  engaged  as  a  whole  time  worker  in     agriculture and in the  course  of such occupation to be  engaged     in  work  of  national importance and to have been  so  employed  at     31st March  1917 shall not be posted for  service  with  the Colours     or  called up for  medical  examination,  or  re-examination.          The Board propose  to obtain the  assistance  of  District  Agri-     cultural Committees in  connection  with the issue of certificates     and they have  circularised  Committees regarding  the change  in     procedure consequent on the above  Order  of the Army Council.     (Copy circular attached.)     2*  Rsvisw  of Exceptions Act 1917:          The  number of cases  brought before  the  Board up  to the  22rd     instant  &quot;was 421.   The great majority  of  these  are being investi-     gated or  are under consideration,  but up to  date 76 certificates     have been  granted; 15 cases have been refused,, 10 on  the ground     that the applicants could not  be described as  being engaged  in     agriculture, and 5 on the ground that their  work was  not of     national  importance.          It  has been found  rather  difficult  to draw  a strict line as     to what  classes of occupation  allied  to  agriculture could reason-     ably be interpreted as  entitling those who followed them to  be     described  a3 being r&apos;engaged in agriculture&quot;  and  a joint letter     on behalf of the Board  of Agriculture and  Fisheries and this     Department  has been addressed  to the  War Office  so  as to arrive     at an understanding on  the matter.

ANDREW SQUARE,                                 EDINBURGH.26th June  1917,       Sir,                            FOOD   PRODUCTION.                  I am directed by the Board of Agriaulture for       Scotland  to state that in some instances proposals involving       the expenditure of public money, eueh as the payment of       Executive Offleers, have  been approved and  carried out by       Executive Committees without the Board&apos;s previous sanction       having been obtained.                  1 am accordingly desired to point out that       whilst the Board are prepared to consider and,  if possible,       approve of financial proposals made by Committees, they       cannot sanction payments  being made from the funds placed *       at the disposal of Executive Committees unless  their formal       approval  haB previously been obtained to the proposed       expenditure.   Care should also be taken to ensure that       where authority has only  been given for payment being made       during a  specified period, the Board&apos;s sanction shall be,       obtained  should any extension of that period be desired,.                               I  am, Sir,                                   Your obedient Servant,                                        H. M. CONACHER.

BOJJRD OF AGRICULTURE FOB. SCOTLAND.SujgpJx.o^QlMg-..J.^-?.g-.-f.Pr preserving Fruit and Vegetables.            The Board of Agriculture for Scotland have made    arrangements with the Ministry of Munitions of War for supply-    ting glass jars for the preservation of fruit and vegetables.            The jars are of the 2 lb. Kilner pattern, with screw    top and rubber ring.            The. price of the bottles is 52/- per gross, carriage    paid to the nearest railway station, including the cost  of    packages, which must be returned to the manufacturers carriage    paid.            Wherever possible  orders should be  for a 4/ ton truck    lead,  icec 400 dozen (the  price of which is  86*15:4); but  in    sparsely populated areas orders will be accepted for 100    dozen  (the price of which  is  215.13:4) .            The Board of Agriculture for Scotland appeal to    District Agricultural Executive Committees, Women&apos;s County    War  Organisations. Parish  Councils  and any  local war organis-     *ations or church societies to assist  in making arrangements    for  combined  orders from each district for  at least the    minimum quantity cf 100 dozen, and  in arranging for the    receiving and distributing the bottles.            Districts unable to make up an order  for 100 dozen    must  get  into touoh with other areas and arrange for a joint    order.            All  orders must be made to  the Board  cf Agriculture    for  Scotland  and are to be accompanied by a remittance for  the    requisite amount.  Cheques etc * -ehculd be  made payable  to  the    Board  of  Agriculture for Scotland and must  be crossed /&amp; Co./            The  name and address  of the consignee and  name of    railway station to which the  consignment should be forwarded    must accompany the  order,  and the person undertaking to  act    as consignee  must assume the  responsibility cf arranging the    local distribution  of the  consignment.             It  is not  intended that retailers of  glass jars  should    make use  of  the above arrangements  for trade purposes, but  it    may be found desirable  to  entrust distribution to  a local     tradesman.   In  these cases the  organisation which  sends  the     order should arrange with  him as  to the charge to  be made for     local distribution.  Similarly where local  organisations may     incur expenses  for  carting from the railway station etc., theV    cost of the  jars  tc  the purchasers  must be  increased so  as  to     cover this  and  all  ether additional expenditure.  .In this     connection it should be noted that  the packages must be     returned  carriage paid  to  the manufacturers.A /
        A leaflet on the subject of &quot;Fruit Bottling&quot;  is atpresent in course of preparation and copies may be had onapplication to the Board.  Any persons who may be unableto collect an order up to the minimum of 100 dozen and whothink that information on the subjeot of Fruit Bottlingmight induce others to take advantage of the scheme willbe supplied with a number of copies of the leaflet fordistribution in their distriot.        Arrangements have been made for a limited number ofdemonstrations in Fruit and Vegetable Bottling to be  givenin suitable centres.  Applications for the attendance of ademonstrator should be made to the Board giving the name ofthe plaoe at which the demonstration is desired and parti-;culars as to date and hour of meeting.        The Board are anxious that local organisationsformed for this purpose should take early steps to establishthemselves into definite societies, and they would be gladto have for future reference the name3 and addresses  of thesecretaries of any such societies formed.oard of Agriculture  for  Scotland,      29 St.  Andrew  Square,    EDINBURGHJune,  1917.

ANDREW SQUARE,                                 EDINBURGH.26th June,  1917.   Sir,              I  am desired by the  Board of Agriculture for Scotland   to oall the  attention of the District Agricultural Committee to   further arrangements that have been made with  a view to deter-   mining what  men can be spared  from agriculture for the Army.              The Army Council now agrees that in  Scotland anybody   certified  by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland to be engaged   as a whole time worker on an agricultural holding and in the   oourse of  such occupation or employment to be  engaged on work   of national  importanoe and to  have been so engaged on the 31st   March 1917 shall not be posted for service with the Colours or   oalled up  for medical Examination or re-exam:Lnation.              The Board will be glad  to have the assistance of Die-   triot Agricultural Committees  for the purpose&quot;of issuing such   certificates &quot;which will, fall to bo gra?ited chiefly to persons who   have been  refused certificates  of exemption by 4Tribunals,  but who.   in pursuance of the various ar^angomozita with  the Army Council   have been  retained in the meantime In agriculture.    The question   will not ariso in the case of  men holding long date certificates   of conditional exemption nor should it normally arise in regard to   holders of certificates of short  periods of temporary exemption in   view of the  terms of a recent  Scottish Office  Circular to  tribunals   recommending /The Secretary,   District Agricultural Committee,
recommending them to renew such certificates automaticallyin-, tie oases of persons working on agricultural holdingsagreed upon by the Military Authorities and the Board to beonly sufficiently staffed.          The Board are in process of receiving from th9Military Authorities lists of men in favour of whom theissue of such certificates falls to be considered.   Theyappear to be, for the most part, men under suspended callworking on farms marked &quot;Sufficient&quot; at the recent agricul-tural Census and after making all allowances for mistakesin the marking, due to ignorance of local conditions and tochanges in the situation,  that have taken place since thebeginning of the year, the Board consider the results of theBorutiny as shown in the classification.of farms as the safestgeneral guide to settle the question whether a man engaged inagrioulture can also bs said to be doing work of national im-portanoe.   If he is &quot;Excessive&quot; to the holding or engaged ina particular piece of work that is not materially contributingto the maintenance of the  food production of the country, hecannot fairly be so described.          The lists referred to will be forv/arded to DistrictAgricultural Committees for the favour of their observationsthereon.                    I am,  Sir,                        Your obedient  Servant,                                H.M.CONAOHER                                    Secretary.
