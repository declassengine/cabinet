ADEN.          -  .... -I desire to.call the attention of the Cabinet and the Military Authorities            to the position  at Aden, and  to the question of the control &quot;of  the  forces            there.   Aden is  politically part of India.   Forces serving  there are, in            normal times, considered  as on Indian Home Service.  The Garrison&quot;.now,            however, is constituted a Field  Force, and enjoys most of  the concessions of            such a force.   The General  Officer Commanding, who  is also  the Resident,            now reports to the Government of India, which in  turn receive instructions            from the Secretary of State.              This  is. a cumbrous  procedure, and  there is the  same  absence of            &quot;unity of  control&quot;  as in  the  early days of the Mesopotamian expedition.            When operations from  Aden  are contemplated,  the  previous  political            discussions would be conducted between the Resident, the Foreign Depart-            ment,  India,  and the Secretary of State for  India.  At  a later stage the            General  Officer  Commanding, Aden,  would communicate  his  plans of            operation through the General Officer Commanding, Southern Arrny, India,            to Army Headquarters, India,  and  so  to the Government of India aDd the            Secretary of State, and (now) to the War Office.              Again, under the conditions of  this war  no addition can be made to the            force at Aden without reference to the.War Office, lest  the number of  troops            available for  other theatres should be affected.              Since  the unsuccessful action  of Lahej  on  4th  July 1914, and. the            disastrous retreat which followed, the garrison of Aden has been practically          -  besieged on a line just north of Sheikh Othman.  and Lahej has remained in            the occupation of the Turks.&apos;              The garrison  eonsists  of approximately 2-1- squadron cavalry ;  1 battery            Royal Field Artillery, 3 Companies  Royal Garrison Artillery, 1 British and            3g- Indian Infantry  battalions, 2  Companies Sappers  and Miners.   It is            believed that the Turkish  force confronting Aden is composed of 2,075 Turks,            450-600 Artillery personnel.  700  Arabs;  30 Regular Cavalry, 29  guns,            7 machine-guns.              Various proposals have been made  at.different times for expelling the            Turks, but the Government of India  have been  averse -from undertaking            operations for the iDurpose, and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff has            opposed the diversion  of  troops  to Aden,  even temporarily, from  other            theatres, since September  1915, when the Indian Brigade,&apos;commanded by            Major-General Sir G. Younghusband, left Aden for Egypt.              .1 do  not  question the  correctness of his judgment, but it is certain that            where the Army  Council is directly responsible  it takes much more interest            in a  military situation, gives  more attention to it, and is more  willing to            render assistance than  where its  control and responsibility  are  not so            secured.   The   Mesopotamia expedition  conspicuously illustrates   this            statement.     .                            ,.               Apart from  this,  the  Aden operations are part and parcel of  the war            against Turkey.   It is generally admitted that our prolonged inactivity there            has  had the effect of deterring the Arabs of Southern Arabia  from openlyI ,           espousing the cause of the King of  Hejaz, and so has been a great hindrancefV?          to the Arab movement which is our principal weapon of offence against the            Turks in that theatre.  But the propriety and  the possibility of action at            Aden  at any. given moment is part of the  general  military problem, to be            decided in the light of a general review of our resources and of our liabilities.            I  desire therefore to  repeat the proposal which I made  more than a year            ago,  that in all  military  matters  the General Officer Commanding,.  Aden,            should be placed under  the control of  the War Office, in order to secure            proper direction of  our effort, proper support for it, unity of control, and            co-ordination of action.                SS 562
   It is also for consideration whether, for the purpose of securing a similarco-ordination of political action, the General Officer pommanding, as PoliticalResident, should not be  placed  under the High Commissioner for  Egypt(who has in his hands the strings&quot; cf our policy in Western Arabia generally)and  of the  Foreign  Office.   The  difficulty of this course  is that  theGovernment of India alone have full knowledge and record of our previouspolitical relations at Aden, and that all negotiations with the neighbouringrulers have been carried on under their authority.   This might  be got  overby. deputing  an  Indian  officer with special knowledge to  Cairo to  adviseSir R.  Wingate.   The Government of India have agreed in principle to theremoval of Aden from their control after the war.                                                               A.  C. -  29th June 1917.
