it is the Property of His Britannic &quot;Majestys  GovemmeiA]Printed for the War Cabinet.  July 1917.SECRET.REPLY TO SIR NORMAN HILUS MEMORANDUM OF JUNE 21,             1917,  ABOUT SUBMARINE LOSSES.     SIR NORMAN HILL&apos;S appreciation of the submarine situationin the Atlantic during the months of April and May is in accordancewith fact, but the conclusions at which he arrives cannot be acceptedas a fair and well-informed criticism of Admiralty policy in dealingwith this most difficult problem.     Whether  the policy of concentration in waters near the coastand  wide dispersion on the  ocean is  correct or not can only bejudged  with a full knowledge not only of the submarine problem inall its details, but also of the naval situation generally, together withthe resources at our disposal to meet this and various other essentialservices.     Ever since  the commencement of the submarine campaign theAdmiralty  has been  faced with the problem  of  how  mercantileshipping could best be protected  with the forces available for thepurpose.  The protection of trade entering the United Kingdom fromthe Atlantic is but one of the  many  duties our patrol  forces arecalled on to perform.   Adequate  provision has to be made for theprotection of the continual stream of troop transports and supplyships crossing to France,  and  for oversea  troop transports  andmunition ships.   Of the auxiliary patrol vessels a large number arecontinually  and  necessarily employed  on coastal escort duties, andover 500 are  daily  engaged in mine-sweeping work round ourcoasts.    After these  services have been provided  for, the number ofvessels  available  for patrol work on the approach routes is entirely-inadequate  to  provide effective protection to the oversea trade;  andeven these inadequate forces have to be depleted from time to timein order to provide for unexpected services which cannot be foreseenand over which the Admiralty has no control.    This lack of patrol vessels  which has  been pointed out  onfrequent occasions to the War Cabinet has immensely complicatedthe problem of  providing  projection for oversea traffic  into thiscountry, and since the beginning  of the war various systems havebeen in operation to  meet changing  methods of attack and at thesame time enable the most effective use  to be made of the forcesavailable for patrol duties.    When  war broke out  no special  orders were in force as tovessels approaching our coasts, but the general principle of dispersalon the  trade routes  was instituted and  has been maintained eversince.    In February 1915, when the Germans announced their intentionof carrying  out submarine warfare  against merchant vessels, orderswere issued for  vessels  when approaching or  leaving the UnitedKingdom to keep a mid-channel course.  This was merely followingon the  principle of dispersal  on the trade routes, and worked fairlywell  while  there  were only a few  submarines operating, and theseonly  of comparatively low power.   As  time  went on,  however,the submarines  increased  in number, size,  and power,  and  theexperience of August 1915 (when  a large number of submarines      [755-1]
operating off the south coast of Ireland, the  entrance to the Bristoland English  Channels,  and in the Irish Sea sank a  number ofvessels  well out  in mid-channel) made it evident that  some othersystem  must he adopted.     The method  of concentration was  therefore brought into forcealong the south coast of  Ireland, and  all available patrols wereconcentrated there.  Good  results followed, and  the  system  wasgradually extended     The result of this concentration led to the submarines operatingfurther  from  the coast,  and it consequently became necessary tobring vessels in on various approach routes.  . These approach routeswere made  as broad as possible, but were necessarily inadequatelypatrolled.     This system  was put into operation in July 1916, and has beengradually developed since.   Thus  the general principle has beendispersion as far  as possible up to certain points of concentration onthe  coast and thereafter a coastal route to destination, hugging, thecoast the whole way.     The same system was  adopted for vessels leaving  the  UnitedKingdom, except that it is possible to hold these vessels up, or altertheir routes to avoid areas in which submarines  are known to beoperating.   This  is not possible in the  case  of  incoming ships, and,consequently,  a larger proportion of losses have occurred in the caseof the latter than of the former.     The increasing number of submarines  operating off our westcoasts has naturally led  to increased  losses of shipping, and  theroute which has  suffered most severely is  that off the south-westcoast of Ireland,  although it is on  this route that our  patrol forcehas mainly been concentrated.     No further alterations  in the  position or  extent of the routesbeing possible, a new system of approach to  the coast was recentlyintroduced.     Briefly, the  system is the establishment of a number of fixedlanes, the inner ends of which necessarily converge as they approachthe coast, the outer ends  being  widely dispersed.   The change fromone lane to another is automatic by  prearranged plan, an interval ofone day being allowed between a change  of  lanes in order to givethe patrol vessels time to take up their new positions.     This system, it is hoped,  may for a time result in decreasedlosses, and  it  will gradually become  inoperative  as  the   convoysystem extends.   It has, however, the disadvantage inherent to  any&quot;Jane&quot;  of traffic.     The x^roblem of protection of the coastal routes, in  spite of  the.additional danger from mines, is  less difficult than  that  of  theapproach routes.     By  making the shipping follow the coast-line  closely submarineattack is limited  to one direction, and a  fairly effective patrol  canbe  maintained by means  of yachts, trawlers,  drifters,  and motorlaunches,, some of which vessels,  either  on  account of  their  sea-keeping qualities or want of speed, are not suitable for patrol in theopen sea. .          -     Sir Norman Hill not only condemns the Admiralty policy,  buthe plainly infers that it is in their power to give effective protectionto merchant vessels if they choose to do so, and that the reason thatsuch protection is not given is failure to realise the gravity of  thesubmarine menace.     A grave charge such as this should be  supported  by the factson  which it is based,  but Sir N. Hill confines  himself  to  a looseexpression of opinion that a  sufficient  force of destroyers  andpatrol vessels can be provided to  guarantee against submarines  thereasonable safety  of an area  of 10,000 or 20,000 square miles withinfrom 200 to 300 miles of convenient ports.  To limit the protectionto 300  miles  would,  of  course, be entirely  futile ; but  acceptingSir N. HilFs figures, and  taking into account only one such area as
he proposes, It may be as well to consider what force Is required toestablish and maintain suck a patrol.  .     For deep-sea work destroyers or sloops are necessary.   Smallerand slower vessels are unsuitable and ineffective, and experience hasshown that one patrol vessel to every  15 square miles is the absoluteminimum required to provide reasonable safety.     It follows that to establish and maintain a patrol over one areaof 15,000 square  miles a  force  of at least  150 vessels  would berequired, or approximately double the  number estimated as necessaryfor a system of Atlantic convoy.     As at present the complete&quot; system of convoy cannot be estab-lished owing to insufficiency of patrol  vessels, it is evident that  ascheme involving the employment of  double  the  force is  quiteimpracticable.     But even  were  the  force  available, the  method  would beineffectual.  All the submarine has to do is to move further out andattack tke skipping as it approackes or leaves tke protected zone.     Tke whole of our war experience has shown that a fair measureof protection to  skipping can  only be guaranteed by a  system  ofindividual escort consisting of  at least two  fast patrol craft, or byarranging for ships  to sail  in groups with an escort on practicallytke same basis.    -     There is, unfortunately, no possibility  of tke number of fastpatrol craft ever reaching tke required figure, and palliative meansmust continue,  combined  with a  vigorous  offensive against anysubmarine-that gives us a ckance of attacking her.                                                -      J.  R.  J.     NAVAL STAFF,            July 1, 1917.PRIXTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BT C. R. HARRISON. 4/7/1917;
