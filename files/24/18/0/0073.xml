This Document is  the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.  July 1917.BRITISH NAVAL POLICY.    THE ultimate objects of British  naval policy are,  first,  tobring pressure to bear on the enemy people so as to compel theirGovernment to come  to  terras, and, second, to resist the pressureapplied by them so that we may carry on the struggle undisturbed.    Positive results are  naturally only obtained by offensive action,but the defensive  side cannot  be. neglected by a country which isdependent on the sea for  its existence.    In order to  attain these  objects, the power of  the British navyis directed into the following channels :     1. The  protection of  the  sea  communications  of  the Allied           armies, more particularly in France,  where the main           offensive lies.    2. Prevention of enemy  trade as a means of handicapping his           military operations and exerting pressure on the mass of           his people.    3. Protection  of British and Allied trade, on which depends the           supply of  munitions and food to the Allied  armies and           people.    4. Resistance to invasion and raids.               &apos;;-    These four  objects  can  only be completely and permanentlyattained by defeating and destroying the enemy&apos;sfighting fleets,both above and  below water, but the weaker  fleet has the power torefuse action; and so long as  action is  refused, every effort has tobe made to attain  our objects, both as a means; of  dragging out hisfighting fleet and resisting  his efforts at coercion.     The  question at issue in  each of these  cases is the control ofcommunication  in certain  areas, and our ability to exercise thatcontrol depends on the concentration of a superior fighting force atany threatened point.  Whilst waiting for a favourable  opportunityto engage the German High Sea Fleet,  the Grand Fleet our mostpowerful  fighting force has taken up  a position supporting thesmaller  craft engaged  in  keeping open the sea  communications,and,  apart from  the submarine campaign, it is  the factor whichenables us to exercise an effectual control over surface craft.  Thewhole Allied cause, both ashore and afloat, is  therefore based on thelatent power of the Grand Fleet.  This is a fact which is very apt tobe forgotten.     The  enemy cannot open  the sea routes to his own ships without^facing a decisive action, and  he is not likely  to run that risk unlesshe  cau first reduce  our superiority in  capital ships by mines orsubmarine attack, or  by fighting with the certainty of being able tobreak off the action and retire to the shelter of his harbours.     In the meanwhile, he  is  endeavouring to circumvent the powerand pressure  of the Grand Fleet with the submarine, and his effortsin  that  direction  have  already attained a- high degree of success.The  enemy  hopes that the  attack on trade by weakening theoffensive  power  of the Allied armies, and by  exercising pressure on  &apos;their people, will bring about peace before he is forced to submit bythe military invasion of his country.     Although submarines are practically  immune from attack bylarge  ships,  their final success or failure  is  influenced by the     [755]                                               B
opposing battle fleets.   The hundreds of  small craft which we usefor protecting trade and  driving the submarine under water owetheir security to the power of the Grand Fleet; whilst the successof the German campaign is partly dependent on the German HighSea Fleet, which tends to immobilise a number of British destroyersand  small craft from trade protection, and to make  the only radicalcure for the present evil, viz., the closing of the enemy&apos;s ports, anextraordinarily difficult operation.     It appears, therefore, that the  enemy&apos;s main fleet is likely toadopt a strictly defensive  attitude during the present phase of-thewar, and if it moves into  the  North Sea its object will probably beto entice our capital ships into dangerous and prepared areas, thusbringing about a  process  of  attrition  by mines and  submarines.The most obvious way of doing that is by raiding, or pretending toraid, the east coast  in the  comparatively, narrow areas of  theNorth Sea.     If  our fleet is stationed at the Orkneys or  in the north ofScotland it cannot possibly intercept these raiding vessels, and if itattempts to do so and the enemy works on a well-conceived plan it will run great risks from,  mines  and submarine  attacks, withoutmuch  chance  of bringing about a decision.  The  proceedings onthe 19th August, 1916, are an instance of this.     If there were a harbour further south capable of accommodatingthe whole  fleet there would be a better chance of intercepting theenemy, but at present there is not, and  it must  be  recognised thata  policy of rushing the fleet, too far to the southward every timethe east coast  is threatened is to play the enemy&apos;s game and to runserious tactical risks for  no adequate strategical object.  The riskfrom submarines is of  course greatly minimised if the  number of&apos;destroyers  accompanying  the fleet  is  adequate, but it is  seldomthat a sufficient  number is  available owing to  the necessity  foremploying them for the  protection of trade.     These raids must be viewed as diversions pure  and simple, andthe way to deal with them is  to retain the Grand Fleet somewherenorth of the latitude of Horns Reef until the enemy has committedhimself  to some  operation  which will  afford  a  good  chance ofintercepting him on the way back.     The disposition of  the British  fleet is  influenced, however, byother factors than raids  on the east coast, for resistance to these wasonly one of the items mentioned amongst the four objects of Britishsea  power. Three out  of four  largely depend upon establishing adefinite control over the  exits to the North Sea.   The Dover areacovers the communications of  the army  in France, whilst it and thearea lying between the north of Scotland  and Norway cover thecommunications of  the whole  world outside  the  North Sea andBaltic.                                 -     So far as the Dover area is concerned the narrowness of thewaters, combined with the risk from mines and  torpedo attack, hasto be  accepted  as a sufficient deterrent to the enemy main  fleet,whilst upon the  flotillas and  light  cruisers at Harwich and Dover,^supported  if  necessary by the  Battle  Squadron in the Medway,devolves the task of dealing with any raiding forces that may attackthe  Dover  area from German ports.     The enemy flotillas based on Zeebrugge and Ostend occupy aposition which add greatly  to  oar difficulties  in  the Dover andChannel area.     It is extremely difficult to prevent them  raiding the south-eastcoast and Dover area by night, although, if they venture far into theChannel or stay long on the coast, they will run considerable risk ofbeing cut off.     A very close patrol of the Dover Straits is necessary to preventenemy submarines avoiding the  minefields by passing through on the  surface as well as to prevent destroyer raids on  the  cross-Channel traffic, and the dispersion of  light forces necessary for that
purpose involves great&quot; risks from the concentrated attacks  of theseflotillas.   That, however, must be accepted, for if losses cause us to-withdraw these patrols at night the enemy will have achieved oneof his principal objects.  The present policy of  the Admiralty inregard to Zeebrugge and Ostend is to endeavour  to minimise  theirutility to the enemy by continual bombardments  from the sea andair,  and  satisfactory results  are  being obtained, although  theGermans can never be denied the use of  these  harbours entirely bysuch means alone.     The same difficulty that exists in dealing with raiding vesselsbased on Belgian ports  arises with regard  to air raids.   Nothingshort of clearing the Germans out of Belgium can alter the fact thathostile aircraft are within easy striking distance of English towns,whereas, if our aircraft attempt to retaliate on  German towns, theyhave much further to go, and are easily reported and intercepted ontheir way back.     On the control exercised over  the northern  area  depends theblockade of Germany, and,  what is  more important at the presenttime, the protection of British and Allied trade from raiding vessels.The latter have not yet  been used on an extensive  scale,  but theenemy may endeavour to  accentuate the effect  of the submarinecampaign by that means.   The difficulty of  locating ships in theopen sea necessitates a blockading force  being placed somewhere inthe narrow northern  area lying between  the  enemy ports  and thevital trade . and  transport routes.   Also,  all the larger enemysubmarines take this route,.and if there  is a  sufficiency of surfacepatrol and aircraft watching it there is a  possibility of  locating  andattacking them there.   The vessels employed  in this duty must alsobe  supported, otherwise they  may be  driven off and a  passageopened by the enemy cruisers  or  battleships.   Whilst the GrandFleet occupies  its present base in the Orkneys it provides thenecessary force for this purpose.    It also partly defeats the immobilising power of  the  Germanfleet by emplojung a proportion of its destroyers and submarines onthe. patrol of this area, but at. some risk  of these vessels not beingavailable for a fleet action.  .     If the Grand Fleet were stationed further south these vesselscould not be so. employed without a certainty that they would notbe  available for battle  purposes.   An advantage of the  northernbase, therefore, is that the flotillas, &amp;c, of the Grand Fleet are to acertain extent available for trade protection  and can be  usefullyemployed during the long period of operations which may or maynot culminate in a fleet action.   There are manifest disadvantagesin the  use of a base so far north to set against this advantage.     Hitherto the  blockade of  the  North Sea exit has been mainlycarried  out  by  the  armed merchantmen  of  the  10th  CruiserSquadron and  a  number of trawlers.   The inherent difficulty ofguarding the Orkney-Faroe-Iceland line, which  is over 400 mileslong, has  been  recently increased  by  submarine  attacks whichsucceeded in sinking the &quot; Hilary &quot; and &quot; Avenger,&quot; and it has beendecided to reduce the strength of the squadron, utilising the surplusvessels to convoy  trade across the Atlantic.     So far as  German  trade is concerned,  the  necessity for ablockade has largely disappeared.  The entry of America and Brazilinto the war, the severance  of diplomatic  relations between Germanyand certain Central and South American Republics, and variousother  causes have greatly curtailed the opportunities of shippinggoods  to  Germany.   The  necessity for a blockade outwards stillexists, however, and  has been accentuated by the  success of thesubmarine campaign.     The  policy of the Admiralty with  regard to protection frominvasion  or raids  is the  next question for consideration.   Theformer is a decisive operation of war, whilst the latter are merelyincidents designed to hamper the conduct  of the  war either  bymoral or material damage.
     Any attempt at invasion is extremely improbable, but ii it were made the enemy would probably adopt one of  the following plans : The transports, lighters, &amp;c., might be escorted by the whole^of his naval strength  until they reached harbour or  shallow water,  when the escorting force would lie off to protect them.  Or more probably, the High Sea Fleet would take up a covering position some distance from the transports so as to gain freedom of tactical movement, with the intention  of bringing about an action by barring the way of the Grand Fleet to the vital area.   Or  the  German fleet might endeavour to avoid an action by decoying the fleet away from  the transports.     In each of these  cases the transports  would  probably be escorted  by  older battleships,   torpedo  craft, minelayers,  and submarines.  As a  serious invasion  could not be completed under several days, the Grand Fleet based on Scapa is in a fairly, but  not wholly, satisfactory position for striking either at the line of passage or  the High  Sea Fleet.  Generally, the Grand Fleet would strike at the latter with  liberty  of action  to  detach against  the transports such  vessels  as the circumstances of the  moment might require..The various monitors, flotillas, submarines, and aircraft on the  east coast have the  particular function of attacking the transports to the exclusion of every  other  consideration, supported as necessary in the southern area by  the Battle Squadron based on the Medway.     With regard to raids  on  the east coast, whether they take the form  of bombardment or the landing of comparatively small bodies of troops, it  has already been pointed out that a fleet based in the Orkneys cannot hope to intercept the raiders, and that as such  raids can do no  more than local damage, it would be obviously.improper for the Grand Fleet to-let  us say pass through an area known to be mined and infested  with submarines in order to prevent that event.    Some protection from these is  provided  by the  submarines stationed on the east coast, the gun defences of the  various towns, and the army.   Although the number of  submarines has  been increased, and the gun defences greatly strengthened during the last eighteen months, these  cannot guarantee  absolute  immunity  from occasional bombardments ;  but the probability is that the enemy will lose ships in the attempt, and that the balance will be on our side.    If information is received of  an attempt on the east coast, the Grand Fleet takes up a position somewhere north of latitude  55g-&apos;&quot; north, from which it can move in  time to cover all  vital interests, whilst the squadron and flotillas in the  south  hold  themselves in. readiness to attack any force which the enemy may detach to escort the transports.   If the raid takes  the  form of  a  coastal bombard- ment,  the  submarines  on the east  coast  take  up positions  in accordance with previously prepared plans and endeavour to torpedo the raiding vessels.             -                The Suhna7*ine Attack on Trade.    The  submarine campaign &quot;now  dominates  and overshadowsevery other operation.   Formerly it  was  necessary to defeat  orremove the battle fleet before an attack on trade could reach seriousproportions  in  the vicinity  of  its  immediate  control,  but  thesubmarine has  partly outflanked the  battle fleet, and  the  enemythreatens our communications without  ever  running the risk  of  afleet action.  The  battle fleet may yet play a part  in  solving theproblem, but, for the present, efforts have to be focussed  against thesubmarine itself, whilst operating in, or on passage to, the vulnerableareas.    It is convenient to describe the many local and  special  opera-tions  connected with the  submarine  campaign  separately.   .Thedevices and methods employed depend on the tactics of the submarineand these vary frou time to time.
                           The trade in the North Sea and English Channel is now mainly                       attacked by  the U.C. type  of submarine, which  is  primarily a                       minelayer carrying from three to eight torpedoes, in  addition to its                       mines.  These vessels can remain at sea from two  to  three weeks,                       and as one of them was recently sunk  to the westward of Ireland,                       they are evidently employed in the Atlantic as well as in the Channel                       itself.                           For minelaying they usually select some spot near a well-known                       route or war channel, where they can fix their position by suitable                       lights.  The U.C.-boats are believed to enter the Channel through                      . the Dover Straits.  The  larger  ocean-going U. boats, on  the other                       hand, proceed to their cruising grounds round the north of Scotland.                       Their radius  of  action and speed being very much reduced when                       submerged,  they travel on the  surface when  making a passage,                       except in the presence of hostile vessels or aircraft, or when specially                       desirous of avoiding observation.  In the North Sea itself, a large                       part of the passage is made submerged.                           In 1915 and 1916,  the  enemy submarines generally attacked                       trade on the surface, bringing their victims to, by gun fire or signal,                       and then  sinking them  by torpedo or bombs.  They thus utilised                       their superior surface speed and were able to overhaul the ordinary                       cargo  ship  from any  direction.   The  more  general arming of                       merchant  ships,  towards the end of 1916, combined with the  risk                       from.decoy  ships, tended  to drive  the submarine more and more                       below the  surface, and the German Declaration of February 1917,                       stating their intention to  sink ships on sight, signified a change in                       the method of attack.                           Out of  the  total British ships sunk  in  1915  and 1916  only                       21 and 29  per cent- respectively were sunk without warning. During                       the months  February,.-;March,  April,  and  May  of 1917,  the                       percentage rose to 64 per cent.   The arming of  merchant ships has                     .  thus made the work of the submarine more difficult and has tended                    .   to  limit its  cruising period to the number of torpedoes carried.                       Other, things being  equal the number of sinkings Would have                       decreased from this cause,  but it hasbeen more than discounted by                       the increasing number of  enemy submarines and the decreased risk                       from gun fire.  The work of arming merchant vessels is proceeding                       rapidly.  On  the 1st January, 1917, 1,420 ships had  been armed, of                       which 83 had been lost;  By the end of June 1917, 3,000 ships had                      , been armed, of which 506 had been lost.                           The number of  surface attacks maybe increased later on by                       the advent of a  larger type of submarine carrying two or three                       5&apos;9-inch guns, for these vessels with a surface  speed  of  20 knots                       could  choose their  own  range and easily defeat  the defensive                       armament of  the ordinary merchant ship.                           The following methods are in use or in course of development                       for hunting and attacking the submarine :                            1.  A very large number of patrol vessels, including destroyers,                       submarines, armed trawlers,  and yachts, are distributed  over  the                       various approach  routes and in the areas  through which the enemy                       submarines have to pass.   Their function is to keep them below  the                       surface and to attack them, when possible, with gun fire, torpedo,.                      . or depth charge.                           2.  Amongst these vessels are seventy-eight special decoy ships,                       ranging from  large  steamships down . to  small sailing vessels                       armed with guns, from 47-inch to  3-pr., and  in some  cases with                       torpedo tubes.*                          3. Aircraft are also being  included in the organisation as fast                       as they can be provided, and have already done good  service on the                       south and east coasts.                          4. The hydrophone is being developed and fitted in patrol                      vessels and has already been instrumental in detecting mine-laying                      submarines.[755]C
     5.  A  certain number  of  our  submarines  are employed inpatrolling  the  probable tracks of the enemy submarines off theenemy&apos;s coast, in the North Sea, and off the West Coast of Ireland.     (I  The whole of  the Heligoland  Bight has been  extensivelymined  up  to a distance of  120 miles from Heligoland, with theexceptions of Danish and Dutch territorial waters, and fresh mine-fields are  constantly being  laid  both  by surface vessels and  bysubmarines.     The result has  been to force the enemy submarines to useterritorial waters largely for exit and  return, and our policy is towatch closely these exits with a view to  destroying  the enemysubmarines as they commence or end their passages.     Owing to the difficulty of laying  fresh mines in waters whichwe have already mined, we are forced as time goes on to extend ourminefields further and further away from Heligoland. There is oneadvantage  in  this, arising from the  difficulty the  German  mine-sweepers have in sweeping up  the  mines, owing to the  increaseddanger they run from attacks  by our  surface vessels as they getfurther  from their bases, but there are also manifest disadvantages.     7. Defensive minefields  are also laid by us, and it is hoped thatdeep mines which, surface craft -can pass  over will,  in conjunctionwith patrol vessels for making the  submarine dive, form an efficientbarrage in certain areas.    It is intended to lay them  where thesubmarine minelayers are known to work and a deep  minefield of anew  type is to be laid in the Straits of Dover.   &apos;  8. Surface  mine nets are also laid  on  the seaward side of trafficroutes, mainly as a protection against minelaying submarines.     9. In addition to these offensive and defensive measures, a greatdeal  also depends on the manner in which&apos;the trade is controlled.The present policy, is to disperse it outside the area of intensivesubmarine operations, each vessel  being given an individual route,already  in use by other ships.  Ships are therefore widely  spread inthe open sea, and there are no fruitful  areas except at the focal andterminal points.   In  the approach waters of the United Kingdom,incoming trade  is divided between two  or more zones, so as to obtaindispersion.   Protection by patrol vessels is divided  between  these,according to their importance and reported submarine movements.The efficiency  of this method depends entirely on  the number ofpatrol vessels, and requirements in this respect  are so heavy that,however many we succeed in building, there can never be enough.Up to the present the  number  of  patrol  vessels  has been entirelyinadequate.  The focal  areas at the entrance to the Channel andsouth and west  of Ireland cover  such a very large space that anenormous number of patrol vessels would  be required to form anefficient protection.     10. The extensive laying of mines  off  our ports and also on theshipping routes round  the  coast  necessitates a  large  number ofvessels,  which  would otherwise be available  for patrol work, beingconstantly employed in minesweeping.    The number of  vessels so employed  at present, exclusive ofpaddle and screw sweepers, is 530.   The greatest danger from minescomes when the weather is bad.  Submarines can lay mines underthese conditions, or may have laid them before the bad weather set in,but  the minesweepers  are unable to  sweep  in  bad weather, andconsequently ships passing through waters which are  favourable forminelaying run great risks  under these conditions.   The policy offitting &quot;otters &quot; to all  merchant ships, now in progress, is the onlysafeguard.     1.1. A  system of convoys has  been introduced during the lastfew months.  It started in  February with the cross-Channel coaltraffic, which was organised in the form of  group sailings on definiteroutes.  The results obtained were so favourable compared with thesystem of uncontrolled  sailings that they proved a strong argumentfor the  introduction  of ocean convoys.    One has already arrived
      Appendix to  Statement  on British Naval Policy. .   The general distribution of  British naval forces in  the vicinityof the United Kingdom is shown in Table I.     With  regard  to forces A, B,  and  C,  the number of  lightcruisers, destroyers, and submarines attached to the Grand  Fleetdepends upon  two factors:  (a) the tactical  requirements  of theBattle Fleet, including. the preliminary scouting  and screeningoperations;  (b) the nature of the control which the Grand Fleet isintended to exercise  in the northern area.   The number of  lightcruisers and destroyers the enemy is likely to employ  against theGrand Fleet in an action of his own choosing may be assessed atthe  present  time  at 20  and 142 respectively.   These  numbersinclude all his  modern vessels, thus  leaving older vessels to controlhis Baltic communications.     A comparison between the probable relative  strength of theGrand Fleet and  the High Sea Fleet  in a fleet action that takesplace under  conditions selected by the  enemy would  show thefollowing results, allowance being  made for the British  having theusual number of vessels absent under refit: Battleships,     (a.) British 1st,  2nd,   and  5th battle  squadrons  and  fleetflagship, comprising  21  Dreadnoughts against Germany&apos;s 19 Dread-noughtS;  There is a slight superiority in favour of the British inregard to the  fighting power  of  the  ships in addition to  thenumerical superiority.     (6.) British 9 Dreadnoughts  of the 4th battle squadron againstGermany&apos;s 7 pre-Dreadnoughts of the 2nd battle squadron.   A verygreat superiority in favour of the British.from Gibraltar and three from America without the loss of a singleship,  and  others  have been  arranged.   A  Scandinavian convoyworked by Grand Fleet destroyers and a coastal  convoy up anddown the east coast are also  working  satisfactorily,  although inthese cases there have been a fair number of ships torpedoed.  Thesuccess which has attended these tentative convoys  should not,however, as yet be accepted as conclusive evidence that the systemwill provide even a partial remedy against submarine attack in openwaters.  There are many and great difficulties to be overcome withan ocean convoy system, and only experience can show howT far theywill, militate  against its  success.  The  real enemy to  the convoysystem will be foggy or bad weather.    In the case  of the ocean trade, the policy is  to escort theconvoys in the open sea with cruisers or armed merchantmen and toescort them through the areas of submarine activity with destroyersor sloops.  It is estimated that about 50 of the  former and 72 ofthe latter would bring one convoy of 16 merchant ships into theUnited Kingdom per day,  and that that would account for nearlyall the inward trade carried by British ships having a  sea speed of12 knots and under.   But cruisers and destroyers have also to  beprovided for escorting transports which are carrying troops all overthe world ; the Grand Fleet, Harwich and Dover  flotillas must alsobe kept up to strength, and the task of finding  additional numbersfor convoy work is the only obstacle to its general adoption.

British 8 to German 5. -              .     - -     The great superiority in protection of the German ships makes them at least a match for the British in spite of inferior numbers.. Light Cruisers.     British 27 to German 20.     A decided superiority in favour of the British, largely discounted, however, by the German use of Zeppelins as scouts. Destroyers.   -  British 78 to German 142.     An immense superiority for the Germans.     With regard to (6) in  the second paragraph, the light cruisers attached to the Grand Fleet cany out frequent sweeps in the North Sea  in  conjunction with destroyers.   Destroyer escorts  are  con- tinually required  for screening  battleships,  cruisers,  and armed merchant cruisers, in and  out of Scapa and  Swarback Minns, and about ten are usually detached for the Scandinavian convoy, and to provide an anti-submarine patrol in the vicinity of Aberdeen.     The destroyers of the Grand  Fleet, in conjunction with trawlers, submarines,  and aircraft,  also carry out  extended operations for hunting submarines returning from or entering the Atlantic.  In a  typical scheme, 48  destnryers  were organised  for this purpose, half being on patrol at a time.     On the 25th  June, out of 109 destroyers and flotilla leaders allocated  to  the Grand Fleet, 12 were  detached for  docking and refit, 4  were on the Aberdeen patrol, 5 escorting  the Scandinavian trade, and 30 others at sea on patrol.   There were, therefore,  56 ready for immediate service,  but if a  cruiser sweep  had  been  in operation, or if any had  been absent escorting minelayers or sea- plane carriers, which&apos; occurs on  an  average of once a week, there would have been less.         -.-.--.-.&quot;&apos;     It  has already been pointed  out that the German fleet is not likely to seek an action or carry but any important operation during the present phase of the war,  and for that reason the destroyers  of the Grand Fleet  can  to a  certain extent  be employed controlling trade and hunting submarines, but the foregoing figures show the heavy demands that are made upon them.     The Grand Fleet submarines stationed at Scapa, Rosyth, and Blyth  are  kept working in various  areas in  the  2\Torth Sea, with a  view  to intercepting and attacking enemy submarines, and in the event of a fleet action or coast  raid, those  at Blyth. have definite duties assigned to them.   &apos;     With regard to force E,  the destroyers  and small craft in the Dover command have  the following duties :  Patrolling the Belgian coast and mine barrage, escorting ambulance transports, controlling traffic  to and from the Downs, and general anti submarine duties- in the Dover area.   A large proportion  of the Dover destroyers are unfortunately out of action from injuries due to collision and mines. On the  2f)th June, out of 33 modern destroyers 13 were repairing at various ports, in addition to  2  &quot; P &quot; and 2- torpedo boats.  The nature &apos; of their duties iu. a foggy area  render  them  peculiarly liable,  to injury  by collision.     The  function of the Harwich force is to  control the southern part of the North Sea, and  to attack any enemy light forces which appear in that area.   It escorts the trade  between  England and Holland, assists in operations against Zeebrugge and Ostend, attacks- enemy  trade: with  Holland,  and covers minelaying operations.  Its- detachments are nearly always at sea.     The &quot; P &quot; boats attached to force G screen the battle squadron from submarine attack, and, if necessary,  sweep a passage  clear  of mines when the squadron goes to sea.
     Force H escorts the trade up the East Coast between the Humberand Lerwick.  Two destroyers accompany each convoy, and oneconvoy generally sails from the terminal ports three days in four.     The submarines of force I patrol certain areas in the North Seain which they may get opportunities to attack enemy submarines orsurface vessels, and also act as scouts to  give notice of the. Germanfleet putting to sea; and those not  at  sea are held  available forattacking the enemy in case of a raid.  The minelaying submarinescontinually mine the approaches to the German rivers.     Forces J and K  are mainly employed escorting and protectingthe cross-Channel communications of the  army in France.     Force L provides the  destroyer escorts for troop transports,specially valuable ships, and convoys.  Force M patrols  the approachroutes to  the South and  West of  Ireland.  Forces N and  0 areemployed on  similar duties to  the North and West of Ireland.     Forces Q and R are used for patrolling and preventing mine-laying in the  vicinity: of the  ports, escort,  and anti-submarineduties.     Table I  shows how numerous  are the demands for small craftto protect the trade  and transport communications in different areas.These can never be satisfied, and preference has to be given to themore important.  Enemy  trade having ceased except  in the Balticand territorial waters of adjacent neutrals, there is no correspondingdemand on  his forces, and  he is  able  to keep his torpedo craftconcentrated: and equipped for battle, relying on his  submarines andan occasional raider to dispute the passage of our trade.     The weaker belligerent who abandons the  attempt  to  open thesea routes to his own ships  and falls back on evasive attack alwayshad this advantage in the past, but it has been accentuated  by thedevelopment of the submarine.     Table II shows the probable  increase and  allocation of lightcraft during the next six months.
