LABOUR ADVISORY OO&amp;UITTEE.(a)  Dock Workers. -   During the week the Committee has been engagedin considering what moans can be adopted to secure other labour forworkmen employed at Docks in Scotland on days on which thero is nowork at the Docks.   This matter is still under consideration.(b)  Finding that difficulties about wages and terms have arisenin the placing of coal miners to work in iron oro mines, the Minis-try of Munitions have been informed that if the work of transferenceof miners is to be carried through this Department must make allthe arrangements from the very beginning and that no other Depart-ment should interfere with the supply of labour and conditions ofemployment,AGR10 ULTURAL SECTIONt(a)  Military and other labour on Farms\     1,   England &amp; Wales.       .&apos;i  During the week tho Commissioners and Sub-Commissionershave boon engaged upon the  work of distributing and placing through-out the Country the men provided by the Military Authorities forAgricultural purposes;     2,   Scotland.          Arrangements  havo been completed with the Military Authcr-ities for the temporary release of tho men required for the HayHarvests.-   It is anticipated that tho first contingent of 500 ofsuch men will be placed during tho coming week.(fr)  Part-Time Labour,     1,   Hay Harvest.          Tho return of the figures showing the  result of tho appealmade for part timo workers  is not complete, but  there  are indiea-tions that tho response hae not been altogether  satisfactory.   Onthe other hand farmers  having hoard of the projectod roloase ofsoldiers for harvest purposes show great unwillingness to employany other kind of labour.     2.   Timber Workers.          National Servico  Volunteers  for timber work  continue  to

be supplied through the Timber Supply Department.     Arrangements have boon made for the cutting of 36 acres ofwoods at Anthell near Sletchlcy.   This work will engage theservices of the men offered through the Volunteer Brigade ofthe Ministry of Munitions for at least 2 months.     3,    Local. Part Time Schemes.          The Liverpool Scheme continues to be actively prose-cuted and a certain number of other localities arc interestedin the idea and contemplate somewhat similar projects.(c)  Agricultural Sobstitutioyu     Having regard to the decision of the Cabinet recently an-nounced in Parliament, that ho more mon are to be taken intothe Army from Agriculture without the consent of the CountyExecutive Committees, it would appear that there will now bono demand for substitxrtes in agricultural work either in England,Scotland or. Wales,   .WORK OF THE SECTION IN SCOTLAND.          -     A large number of letters have been received from Scottishfarmers  testifying their appreciation of the labour supplied themby this  Section.   A very few extracts are appended:     Letter from the Secretary of Rhino District,  Wigtownshire.    &quot;I may state all the men you have sont to this District through   your Department, have given great satisfaction, and I have nothad one single complaint about any of the men.   The Farmers arevery grateful .for the assistance of those soldiers, and, on behalfof my Committee, I have to thank you for the very prompt and of-ficient way you have dealt with all applications sent from thisDistrict.&quot;(2)  Letter from W, Niven, Smlthston, Maybole.    &quot;On March 14th, my foreman ploughman (who had  been with me for17 years) and his Son, both left their work without any warning,and on the following day I applied to you for men.    On the 16thone man arrived and on the 17th ajaother came.
     These two men were with me till called up on 10th May, and I can safely say I never had better men.   They did practically the whole of the Spring work on the farm in a way that left nothing to be desired.   They were hardworking, most obliging follows.     After they wore called up you sent me two Edinburgh Policemen Y/ho have also both given entire satisfaction.     On enquiry at a number of my neighbours who have had men, I find that their experience has been the same as mine, and that they, like me, feel indignant that such an article should have appeared in tho public press as the one referred to.&quot; (3)  Letter from Robert Cullen, Bridgend, Ialay.    i(I assure you it is a great benefit to Mr, Wallace to get the man at this time, and I am sure he will give every satisfaction as Mr. Taylor says he is a first-rate man,&quot; (4)  Letter from James Martin, Ladybank.    (iI have to thank you and your Department for your punctual attention to my letters, and the trouble you have taken to procure suitable men for mo.:V GENERAL TRADES SEC TION. - (a)  Trade Committees,   The work of these Committees is now well in advance of the demands for substitutes required to replace young and fit men withdrawn from Munition and Admiralty work.  The work of these Trade Committees would be greatly stimulated if they could be told that there was a real and active demand for substi- tutes.   At present there is a growing feeling that the substitutes are not required.   In spite of this fooling the Department is press&apos; ing forward the formation of Committees but this cannot bo indefin- itely continued unless the promised &quot;gaps to be filled with substi- tutos&quot; are actually created,-(b)..&apos; Other Schemes.     Seme 180 men have now been transferred from North Wales Slate Quarries to Dolomite etc quarries.   On June 27th, a meeting cf the Committee in the Cast Iron Hollow-ware Trade was held with a view to starting an &quot;internal substitution&quot; scheme on the lines of that in tho China and Earthonrarc Trade.
(c)  Local National Service Committees.     Up to the 28th June thcro had boon, rec-eivod 829 returns ofappointment of Local National Service ComnTltrt^es-^LnJEL^^          -Wales out of a total of 1,053 which it is expected to set up,and 136 such returns of appointment in Scotland out of a totalof 286.   In view of the growing amount of work and-re-apon/Ufol1t-t-y&quot;-in connection uith these Committocs the Director-General has de-cided to form a separate &quot;Local Authorities Section&quot; and reportsof the work of Local National Service Committees will in futurebo given under this heading.SUBSTITUTION SECTION.     The number of applications received from Employers duringthe week amounted to 1,293.   In connection with these and similarapplications received previously 1,447 Volunteers have boon sub-mittod to Employers and of these 660 have been placed.     Y/hen the work of allocation was taken ever from the Emplcy-ment Exchanges on lrt May last it was estimated that from 20,000to 30,000 vacancies would be handod over to be filled fey this Dc-partmcnt and that there Tfould be a constant-flow of further vacan-cies for Substitution and applications for reinforcement to bo dealtwith by this Department..   In fact, both these anticipations havebeen falsified, for only 5,373 live vacancies were handed over tothis Department by the Employment Exchanges, and subsequent appli-cations passed on by the Exchanges amount only to 1,091 for Substi-tution and 43 for reinforcement.     The unsatisfactory result so far attained is attributable tothree primary causes:(a)  Lack of active co-operation between the Employment Bxchanges     and this Department.     -&quot;   --    -a-  .-       This sets up a system of dual control and responsibility.     The Substitution Officers find their activities restricted Inrogard to every demand that reachos them, in consequence of the ne-coosity of their having to hand each demand to the A,E.O. to bedealt with whilst that Officer is dMng practically nothing to pro- \vi&amp;e opportunities fov f 113in;  ivinforoomont vacancies.
 (b)  The absence of any demand for the reinforcemont of labour,     This is mainly attributable to the fact that men have not so far been removed for Military Service from Munition works and consequently the vacuum has not been formed which it was intended that National Service Volunteers should fill. (0) --^g^rofusal-of Employers to accept Substitutes offered,    . Employers not only refuse to accept Volunteers but in many instances tho Employer offers such wages and terms of employment as to make it impossible for the Volunteer to be employed.     Commissioners and Substitution Officers appear to bo doubtful about theultimate success of the scheme unless these difficulties can be overcome.   Extracts from reports sent in by them are appended to illustrate these points.  Thus Mr0Rowland writes:-.              &quot;That any system intending to provide for               mutual co-operation between the N; S. *Department             . . and the Employment, Exchanges in placing labour             ..  wl.!.! always fail. for . there cannot undor any              ; circun.stancqs, bowevor favourable, exist a               successful system of dual control and               responsibility&quot;.     These views seem to have been fully shared by the Substitution Officers who recently mot at an important conference at Cardiff. Again, a resolution on similar linos was passed by the Area Sub- stitution Officers at a meeting held in Leeds.   This resolution was handed in by Mr, Smedley and is in the following terms:-              &quot;That this meeting of Aroa Substitution Officers is               unanimously of opinion that the scheme as laid down               in A.C.IFs 675 and 780  is unsatisfactory and unwork-               able, and thoy Y/ish to  emphasise the following defect                  Tho present dual control by the A.3.0.  and A.E.O.               is unworkable..   All Substitution work should be in            .... tho hands of one Officer, who should be directly ros-               ponsiblo to the Military Authorities.&quot; Again, the arrangement which provided  for Employment Exchangesbeing given the first opportunity of meeting demands  has  been the subject of comment, and Mr.  Jackson has called attention to  a new point in this connection.   When recently visiting a factory in Lancashire ho ascertained that it was  the custom of the firm to submit a weekly list of their labour requirements  to  the  Local- 6 K
 Employment Exchange.   He was shown one of these lists, and noting among.other items 90 labourers asked for the previous week, he enquired whether that demand had been met by the Exchange.   He was informed that only some 40 had been sent,   He then asked what further action the firm were taking in regard to obtaining the labour they wanted, and he learnt that any demand outstanding one week would go down as a new demand to the Exchange the week follow- ing, all previous requisitions for labour having been cancelled thereby.   In this way the nine days which the Exchange have tc satisfy a demand would never elapse, and the A.S.O. would conse- quently never have any opportunity of placing Volunteers in omploy- ment at the Factory concerned.   This is the only case of the third reported, but it is more than probable that there are many ether similar cases in the country.      As regards the arrangement by which the Exchanges have hither- to got the first pick of the labour-, the following resolution passed at the Cardiff Conference referred to above may be quoted:     &quot;That the system by which the Ministry of Labour through the Em-     &apos; ploymcnt Exchanges gets the very firsV pick of all N.S. Volun-      tcers leavJng only tho residue for possible employment by the      H.S,. Dopsrtment either as reinforcement in work of National      importance $r as substitutes for men transferred to the Array,      renders almost nugatory the whole scheme of National Service      so far as the placing of Volunteers by the N.S. Department is      concerned.&quot;. Again, at a conference in Leeds, a resolution was passed:     &quot;That the enrolment as War Munition Volunteers qf men who have      enrolled as N,S, Volunteers deprives the local Substitution      Officer of his most satisfactory substitutes, and consequently      renders the work of providing men for the Army extremely dif-      ficult.&quot;      In this connexion however it should be stated that the arrange- ment by which all enrolment forms have been sifted by the Employment Department has this week been ended.   As showing that it is -only  the most difficult demands that arc handed over to be dealt with,^ Mr, Earston may bo quoted as follows:-      &quot;It cannot I think be too strongly emphasised that the Substi-       tution Officers arc at present placed in a most unfair position       of supplying  labour as compared with the Employruenx Exchanges,       and the results they are able to show can hardly be otherwise       than meagro.   They are called upon to supply skilled labour
     7/hich the Employment Exchanger ha^e found it impossible to     obtain with all the machinery at their disposal.   It is es-     pecially felt as a hardship that practically all the cards of     skilled and semi-skilled men who now enrol at the Area Substi-     tution Offices should be abstracted Tfhen sent to St. Ermin1s     and handed ovor to the Employment Exchanges, whilst the onrol-     ment cards of men whom it is almost impossible to place are     returned to the A.S.O. to make up his pool for supplying labour.Similarly in the report from Bristol, Mr. Rogers- says:-    &quot;That the A,S.O,s all point out that the vacancies to be filled     are for highly skilled or very scarce men, and. most of them     have been in the; hands of the Employment Exchanges for weeks     or Tgont3is without success, even &apos;though they had practically     all&quot;ohe present pool of H.S. Volunteers at their disposal.YfOKEH&apos; S SECTION.  -(1)  Women&apos;s Army Auxiliary Corps.     A Selection Board was held at Brighton during the week.     At a Conference between the Secretary of State for War andthe Director-General together with othor representatives of theWar Office and the National Service Department, the subject ofthe recruiting of women for the   A.A,C was discussed, particu-larly as to whether this should in future be carried out by oneor other of the Department.   The matter Is now receiving the furtherconsideration of the Secretary of State.(2)  Women1s Land Army,     The number of women offering themselves for service in theWomen1s Land Army to the date of this-Report was as follows            England    .....     33,151.            Scotland   .....      2,930.     The desirability of utilising the services of women on theland as whole time, part time and as short period workers is re-ceiving the consideration of the Board of Agriculture in conjunc-tion with the Womon&apos;s Section of this Department.(3)  Timber Polling/     It is anticipated that hostels at Newstead and Barnham willbo opened oarly next week for the reception of  these Volunteersaccepted for the course  of training,
4.   Hay Baling.                                   ,     The Pelage Department of the War Office having notifiedits intention of employing women for the baling of hay, eandi-dates are being recruited ahd interviewed so that the need maybe promptly supplied.5.   Wopllen and Cotton Wasie.     The sum of  512,18.6d.  representing the net proceeds ofthe first sale of articles collected has been received fromthe Auctioneers who sold the collection on 12th June last.Satisfactory progress  is  being  made with this particular work.                     &apos;      (Signed)  NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN.
