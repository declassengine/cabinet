SECRET..,MATERNITY. MD CHILDWELFARE BILL,Hotes on Lord RhonoLda^s Memorandum (Q,T. 1056.).     1.   I am su;;e that any criticism which I- offer  ofthese proposals will-not be interpreted as showing any wantof sympathy with Lord Rhondda1s aims, but I feel bound topoint out that, in my opinion, this Kill will  not be  regardod-in parliament as non^-controversial, and is not sufficientfor the objects which we must all support- Lord Rhondda indesiring to secure.     2,   It will be within the recollection of the WarCabinet that, on the&apos; 27th, March Lord Rhondda circulated&apos; aMemorandum (.G.T, 361) on &quot;The, Urgent, Heed for,..a-: Ministry  &quot;.,of Health.&quot; I have always understood that the  convictionexpressed in this Memorandum that nothing but  a Ministry..of Health, could effect tho essential reforms required&apos;inthe. Public Health services wf.s based on his examinationof proposals closely similar to those contained in theMaternity and Child Welfare Bill.     3.   -In this Memorandum Lord Rhondda put  tho objectionsto a limited measure of this kind in a way which I cannotimprover:and I  content myself with quoting two of hissentences/
     (para.  1.)..  &quot;Yet  directly the  local Government&quot;Board proposes  a  Bill  for  giving new powers  to &apos;&quot;local authorities to provide  improved cervices&quot;for maternity and infant welfare, obstacles  are&quot;raised;  firstly,  because it is alleged the new&quot;steps can in fact only be  made effeotivo if&quot;fitted in closoly with the existing insuranoe&quot;services; this, however, it.is almost impossible&quot;to achieve  under  present conditions,  since the&quot;latter aro  under  a different  organization and&quot;direction;  and, secondly,  because the insurance-&quot;people say that,  unless their services arc&quot;developed at the  same  moment, the new Local&quot;Government  Board  step  will be prejudicial to&quot;Health Insurance  work.&quot;     (Para.  3.).  &quot;The  services of the Local  sanitary&quot;Authorities and of the Local  Insurance Committees,&quot;at present  working on  different lines and ofton&quot;as rivals,  need to be  co-ordinated  and developed&quot;in closo co-operation, instead of being (as  now)&quot;supervised  by-two separate and rival  Central&quot;Departments, on differing  lines of  policy.   This,&quot;again,  can  only be achieved by combining into one&quot;Central Ministry  the medical  functions of the Local&quot;Government  Board  and of the Insurance.Department.&quot;
in     4,   It was for the precise reasons put forward byLord Rhondda in his Memorandum.that the Committee ofMinisters presided over by Lord ;Milner and Mr. Henderson,and the Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee, ofwhich I was Chairman, agreed.in.coming to the conclusionthat the only measure which would effectively secure.improvements&apos; in the public health and put an end to thepresent competition and overlapping between the Health vAuthorities, both Central and Local, was the establishmentof a Ministry of - Health.          It is, I believe, this competition and overlapping,far more than.any defect in the. powers vested in local healthauthorities, which has hitherto been the main obstacle toprogress.  I must admit that I am less hopoful than eitherLord Rhondda or Sir E. Cornwall about the practical resultsof &quot;consultation&quot; between the Local. Government Board and arival Department&apos;.  &quot;Consultation&quot; which.lasted for years,and was only terminated by. Lord Rhondda\s agreement withMr. fisher, took place between the Local Government Boardand tho Board of Education oh out health work among youngchildren.  Meanwhile the children were not effectivelylooked after.  &quot;Consultation&quot; in regard to tuberculosisschemes between the Local Government Board and theEnglish Insurance Commission is  the established practiceunder the national Insurance Act,. 1911,  and is a fruitfulsource of difficulties and delays.     5./
      5,   The present Bill, as explained by Lord RhonddaTs Memorandum, seems to me to allow a dangerous latitude &quot;both to the Local Authorities and the Local Government Board in regard to the constitution of the bodies by whom these extremely important measures for the improvement of the health of women and children would be administered.   I gather from Clause 1*  of the Bill that it F/ould be  open  to  the Local Government Board to sanction arrangements  made  for  this purpose  by any of the  Local  Sanitary Authorities,  that  is,  even by  the smallest Urban District and Rural  District  Councils;  and further, to sanction the delegation of these powers,  even by small Local Sanitary Authorities, to  Committees which might comprise persons who Y/ere not members of the Authority (see Section 2 (2) of the Notification of Births  (Extension) Act, 1915).  I do not believe &quot;that public opinion would uphold the policy.of enabling small Local Sanitary Authorities, or still more,  bodies with a strong infusion of voluntary workers,  to undertake these duties.   Such a policy is  definitely opposed to the whole direction of modern legislation,  which has  relied uponthe County Councils,  as the most powerful Local Authorities,to enforce needed  reforms.
     6*   Lord Rhondda. mentions, as part of the provisionwhich it is suggested that Local Sanitary Authoritiesshould make under this Bill, Creches, Day Nurseries, MilkDepots for Infants, and Nurses.  I notice that he omitswhat I regard as vhe most important element in such ascheme, namely, the provision of medical attendance forwomen and children, either in the home, at centresestablished for. ,the; purpose, or in institutions of thenature of the existing voluntary hospitals.  I cannotthink that, in this connection, the Local GovernmentBoard can have overlooked the existence of the systemof medical treatment and attendance established underthe National Insurance Acts.          Medical attendance is., at any rate, an essentialpart of any scheme of this kind, and the moment it becomesknown that such proposals are under consideration by theGovernment, the.doctors on the panel under the NationalInsurance Acts, whose Interesto are necessarily affected,begin to press Ministers for assurances on the questionswhether the proposed further provision shall, in general,.be administered by means of domiciliary attendance or throughcentres specially established;  whether it can be madeavailable without a revision of the. terms entered intowith doctors under the National Insurance Acts at thebeginning of medical benefit in 1913;  whether the workwill be carried out by doctors  who are whole-time servantsof/
of the State, or by general practitioners who would retaina private practice, and 30 on.  It was Lord Rhondda&apos;sexperience of difficulties of this kind in the early monthsof the year, when publicity was first given to hismaternity and child welfare scheme, which led him toadopt the bolder alternative of establishing a Ministryof Health; and to revert to the smaller scheme will, I amsure, only revive the same difficulties.  The LocalGovernment Board, as was pointed out in the report ofmy Sub-Committee (paragraph 9) has not been accustomedto deal with general practitioners on questions of thisnature, and the inevitable result of allowing the Boardto put forward proposals affecting these practitionersis to antagonise the profession and to make the passageof the Bill into law difficult, if not impossible.     7.   Further, the Bill will, I am certain, beimperilled by the competing interests of Local sanitary  -Authorities and Insurance Committees, which as Lord Rhonddahimself has stated, in his Memorandum of the 27th. March,can only be reconciled by establishing one CentralDepartment to corrolate both sets of interests.  It wasLord Rhondda&apos;s experience of the feelings of these bodies,as well as the negotiations with doctors on the panelreferred to above,  which made this conclusion seeminevitable/
 inevitable to him in March, and I see no reason to think that the position is different to-day.     8.   I should add that I feel convinced, from our experience in regard to the proposals for a Ministry  ...... of Health, that the Approved Societies, about whose attitude I share the view expressed by Lord Milner in his minute of the 84th, May (G.T, 639), will not fail, on the introduction of such a Bill as Lord Rhondda proposes, to obstruct the measure by putting at the highest their claims to recognition in any future development, of public health services.  I do not doubt that any reasonable apprehensions which the Societies may feel about a Ministry of Health can be removed if the. proposals are explained to them and understood by them.  The Prime Minister has, I believe, already undertaken to give their representatives an opportunity of expressing their views about  the Ministry.   But theirmisgivings will be equally strong about any healthmeasure which is entrusted to  the Local Government  Boardas;distinct  from the Health Insurance  organization.  .     9.   I  am sure therefore  that nothing is  to begained in the way of avoiding  controversy and  oppositionby contenting ourselves  with the  introduction  of this  Billinstead of the larger proposal which was  adopted byLord/
Lord MilnerTs Committee and sympathetically considered bythe War Cabinet on the 6th. June^ -iff^wfefSH^teOn the contrary, I believe that the smaller measure hasless-chance of passing into law; would, if it were passed,prove ineffective for the purposes at which it aims,&apos; andwould not impress the public imagination in the same wayas the establishment of a Ministry of Health.  It would,moreover, fail to touch the important subjects, otherthan provision for women and children, which can also onlybe effectively, handled by a Ministry of Health, namely theearly formulation of preventive measures against epidemicsarising out of the war, the extension of treatment fortuberculosis,  especially among &quot;discharged soldiers,  andthe ultimate reconciliation of the competing claims  ofGovernment Departments., other than the Local GovernmentBoard and the  Health Insurance organization,  to variousspheres of public health work.
