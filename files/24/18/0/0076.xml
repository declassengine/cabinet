Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.B.6.Memorandum on the Present Situation.        The foil owing memorandum embodies the results of enquiries   in Switzerland extending over several months, by a very able   Italian journalist.   It was sent by him to the Italian Government;   and one of his colleagues has given permission for it to be   translated and circulated confidentially.    In spite of its length   it will, it is suggested, be found to be of very remarkable interest.   Its contents fall under five heads;-         I.  Economic and military conditions in Germany.        II.  German Aims.       III.  Austro-German intrigues in Switzerland.        IV.  Passivity of the Entente.         V.  Final conclusions.     L  The first question to which I tried to find an answer is:   what are the conditions of our enemies from the point of view of   internal resistance?   Obviously when one speaks for example   of bad economic conditions, one must always bear in mind that it ie   a question, not of absolute, but of relative factors, of co-   efficients, not of actual forces.   All that can be expected from   these co-efficients is that they should become such a3  to be able   to exorcise at a given moment a decisive influence  My impression   is that that stage has already been reached.        I do not think it necessary to produce documents as to the   lack of food and of other indispensable things,  now prevalent,^  in Germany and in Austria-Hungary;  for there is now obvious and   frequent evidence, direct and indirect, even from  the mouth of   the enemy (e.g., theUhlig interpellation  in the Saxon  Chamber
                           - 2 - oa the 15th of. last, month).  &quot; I. will mexaly add that -all 3*eliabl^&apos; sources which I. nave i*ee*r*able **t4 con suit donf irm this^ evidence. save in matters of detail.   Those who challenge this view base their ohallenge on the fact that in Germany there is nominally no lack ef anything,  that there is very little, but still something of everything.   X may say that some factors in my investigation of what may be called its psychology convinced me that its force consists above all in the simultaneous and general depression which has been produced in the conditions of life, and which hampers andprevents the satisfaction of every-need great&quot;annV^small.Hor is the often quoted argument of nhabit&quot; worth anything.   Hahit cannot be formed, for the simple reason that this condition is regarded as transitory and that the continual waiting, or rather the continual hope of a morrow which will restore normal conditions prevents that initial stage of getting accustomed which means the forgetting of old habits.   Besides, the sternest but the most definite proof - far more definite than the fact that a kilo,  of oil at Vienna costs nine crowns,  or that the ration of potatoes at Dresden is less than throe-fourths of the nominal card ration - Is the enormous statistical  increase year by year in the mortality                                                    of of persons under twenty and over fifty - an increase/which I had confirmation at Basel from a most serious source, on the basis of special inquiries in the cantonal Statistical Bureau.    Theproportion of mortality in the  schools, for instance,  is such that they are thinking of entrusting a central commission with the study of the problem and the decision as to the most urgent remedies,  seeing that-the measures &quot;taken by the authorities of thevarious federal States have produced inefficient results.    Allthi- undoubtedly signifies that want has eaten not into what is sup::, flu ou s, but into what is essential.    There is no sign that conditions are likely to improve  unless new factors intervene.    Ihave heard various views on the ^Imperial Food-Control  Offices
                          i 3 - decision to anticipate the harvest by a fortnight.   Some inter- pret it as proving the urgency of avoiding a period of excessive want i ^ethers (and I think more accurately) as dictated by military exigencies.   There are indeed a variety of views regarding the period at which the resources of the new harvest ought to be exhausted.   I have heard December quoted.   Prom various information I am convinced that the beginning of the crisis ought not to occur before February.   Harvest prospects in Germany are hitherto not bad, so far as weather is concerned, but the forecasts always give a result lower than what is necessary.   Those who say that in Germany during the last two years there has been much work for the extension of cultivation (it appeais that in some districts potatoes have been planteu  ?ven in the spaee left free where railways join) overlook the facts (1) that almost all the cultivable area in Germany was really under cultivation, (2) that in view of the increasing lack ef labour, scarcity of horses and limited amount of manure available,  etc, an extension of cultivation has not helped cultivation very much,  because extension has been simply at tho expense of thoroughness.    And this must be the cage if, for example, certain  big Polish proprietors of Posnania - one of the most fertile grain provinces of Prussia - admit that some parts of their properties will only succeed in producing this year, owing to imperfect means of production,  40 p r c:,nt of th-  tv/o pecvious years.     Conditions in Austria-Hungary arc very similar to those in Germany.   For instance, the harvest in the Banat is very inadequate or/ingto lack of farm hands.   In addition, Austrian climatic conditions have been  far from favourable - for instance,  in UpperAustria where the vines have been badly damaged by hail,  v/hile in various places the potato crops have been damaged by excessive rain.    Uone the less for certain things - eg.,  meat  and poultry -
   Austria  is  still less hard up than Germany,  owing.to what manages   to evade the Hungarian customs, strict; as.they are.   For instance,   in the Austrian markets there is at present  a certain abundance   of mutton owing to increased lack of hay and straw: but this   abundance is of course unexpected and. ephemeral and will have to   be discounted.       In  short, I am convinced that the situation from the point   of view  of provisioning is really extremely  grave-   Thio state of   affairs  is complicated by the transport crisis which has latterly   grown exceedingly acute.   There is a lack of trucks and locomotives   the enormous wastage has rapidly exhausted the reserves and the   three or four factories remaining (since the beginning of tho war   Krupp has completely given up the construction of locomotives) are   not sufficient for the necessary repairs of material.   People who   have recently been in Germany have expressed to me their surprise   at  the condition of material even in the ordinary trades - bad   repairs, bits of.wood applied anyhow and not painted, etc..   The   lack of grease keeps this logorio chronic.    From corn to hides,   from fats to textiles the shortage and. discomfort produced by the   blockade weigh upon the whole of the nation and may at any time   become elements of defeat.       Usually pessimism as to the efficiency  of those factors is   due to expecting too much from them.   Though grievous, these   conditions might permit Germany to prolong her resistance for a   period which cannot yet be foreseen.   The basis of resistance lies   elsewhere.   For Germany, for Austria-Hungary the problem of   resistance is not one of rcvictualling but of politics.   The truth   is  that after three years of war the spirit  of the masses still%  retains no persuasion that the war v/aged by the Central Powers is a   defensive one.   The feeling of the growing  superiority of their   enemies, the dim perception, of.danger which,  despite all confidence   in  their own military strength, is spreading wherever there is
disposition towards criticism, contriTnrtos^in^a&apos;-CH3rt^inwards the reinforcing of this persuasion.   Such a state ofmind lies at the root of &quot;resistance: it is formed mainly of passiveevidence hut for that very reason is the more unreasoning and slowto eradicate.    And then the confidence in a relative, if not in anabsolute, victory ie far from being on the decline, even in themiddle-and-lower &quot;bourgeoisie, upon which perhaps the greatestburden of the War falls, at least so far as regards the discomfortcaused by want and high prices.   It must be said that the govern-ment contributes most of all to keeping alive this confidence, andin the first instance because it is itself convinced.   From everycontact which I have had with men and circles who know Germany intimately and are able to follow even the most imperceptiblemovements which take place there, I have gathered the impressionthat the spheres who really govern - that is, the High Militaryand Naval Command--  have never been so profoundly optimistic asat present as to a speedy and favourable end to the war.    As thosespheres hold the country completely in their hands ( the  civilgovernment continues to be very limited in action), it is naturalthat they should succeed in imposing their conviction upon it.   Thisconviction rests on three points - absolute confidence in thefirmness of the western front, the submarine war and the  certaintythat Russia is now permanently out of the fight.   According to avery recent report made to the Swiss General Staff by an  officerwho visited the western front, the so-called Hindenburg Line hasnot yet been reached, those sections of it which the English claimto have occupied being mere branches of the old lines turned intoadvanced guard positions.    The real Line, which had been readyin its main structure since December 1916 and planned about a yearearlier, is some kilometres further back;  and being the result of allthe accumulated experience of three years of trench war,  it isregarded in Germany as absolutely impregnable.;   And as the Lino,
so too Eindenburg1s strategic reserves amounting to 500,000 menconcentrated in the Lille district (v/ith a view,  it would seem,to a possible attack on Calais),  are  according to information ofthe Swiss General Staff, still intact.   So far as Russia is con-oerned, apart from the conviction that the degree of disorganisationin the army renders absolutely impossible in the near future anychange such as would make it once more dangerou3, in Germany theyby no means despair of making peace or at least  something whichwould be equivalent to a separate armistice.     II.   The work of German agents, mobilised for this purpose,is enormous in Switzerland.    A neutral who has Russian connectionsand had received some time ago from an agent connected with Bulowa proposal for going to Petrograd and conducting propaganda fora separate peace, defined to me as follows the conditions whichGermany would be disposed to offer, or professes herself as dis-posed to offer: (l)  Immediate financial help.   (2)  The formationof four States with a wide autonomy but under Russian sovereignty -namely, a Baltic Kingdom (Courland and Livonia), Lithuania, (itis to be noted that in Polish circles there has  been for someweeks past much talk of a scheme  for  reconstituting  a GrandLuchy of Lithuania directly dependent on Germany), Poland (witha part of Volhynia; Germany would keep up to the line Rawka-Bzura-xTarew, i.e., the Government of  Kalisz, part of thePiotrkoff and Warsaw Governments  and  those of plock, Lomza andSuwalki), and Armenia.   (3)  Neutralisation of  the Straits.(4)  A treaty of commerce with wide guarantees in favour ofRussian exports.   As regards submarine warfare  the conversion  ofBethmann-Hollweg is symptomatic.    His last speech may be takenalmost as an index to the optimistic  feeling which prevails inBerlin.   Those who say that this is  far from clear are wrong:  inGermany it has suddenly become extremely clear.    The agreementof view between Government and High Command is not a matter of
 convenience but, at least for the moment, an undoubted reality. An important factor in producing this agreement was the Chancellor&apos;s recent visit to the G.H.Q.:  his personal relations with Hindenburg are at present excellentV   It may be that the conciliatory attitude of the Chancellor 13 due to the impossibility of maintaining himself without an agreement with the High Military who really govern the country.   I was informed that Bernsdorff&apos;s candidature wasventilated for a moment.    Bernsdorff, as soon as he got back fromAmerica, had at once asked to go to G.E.Q.  to confer with theEmperor, but this&apos;-was refused him.    He recently repeated the requestwhich was granted.    A few days after Bernsdorff had been there the Chancellor also went there,  and the situation was discussed at greatlength.   The result was the draft  of a political-military planwhich was to be a kind of &quot;Hindenburg plan&quot;, i.e.,  the great finalplan in which all the experiences and possibilities of three years of war would be realised.    Now if it seems certain that the GeneralStaff has receded from its uncompromising annexationist ideas (seemingly for reasons of tactical  opportunism),  it is none theless true that the  spirit  of this plan remains one of offensive,and that the peace  which would follow would be a peace in keepingwith this spirit.    This annexationlst view, subject to thenecessary formal qualifications,  has very wide support from themajority of public  opinion.    The government, or if you will theregime, is still very stronr, politically.    I tried to summarise,to control, to estimate as accurately as possible all the elementsavailable for a verdict and I am convinced that for the moment it is absolutely premature to reckon on the possibility of popularpressure against the government or  of a gradual breach between theresponsibility of the people and its rulers.   Thereis,  it is true, talk of a vague anti-dynastic sentiment which bids  fair to spread and is making some  way even  in the  middle classes;  of the v/ord &quot;republic&quot; sometimes appearing timidly in conversation;  of
anecdotes which circulate among the soldiers such as that of thePrussian soldier who,  mortally wounded, grumbled at not being ableto have near him at that moment the Emperor and tho Crown Princesince then he would have had the satisfaction of dying like Christbetween two thieves.    But it is a question of an unconsciousnesswhich, unless unforeseen incentives intervene, is not strong enoughto mature sufficiently.    Hor have the workmen&apos;s movements of lastMarch been of really serious political importance, as I have con-vinced myself from reliable sources of information regarding in-  ,.&quot;cidents in the industrial centres of Alsace.   It was a mere matterof demonstrations of protest owing to food scarcity in which thepolitical factor does  not enter or at most in an isolated way.Substantially the country is still solid with the government,  noris its confidence sufficiently shaken or the discontent sufficientlyserious to induce it as yet to abandon this solidarity.     III.   The fact that a strong feeling of confidence stillexists in Germany does not of course mean that the desire for peaceis not keen, wide-spread and ever-growing.   There is not a goodGerman who does not speak of peace at least twice a day at lunchand dinner.    In Vienna the lower classes expect peace by the15th June; the upper classes are getting their bankers to sell warstock in order to buy  Austro-Americana.   The Empress has a specialMass every fortnight and wants every one to know it.    But whenVictor Adler says (a3  he did about three weeks ago when passingthrough Switzerland on his way from conversations with Scheidcmann,to a prominent member  of the Theological Faculty of Zurich University   a scrupulously honest source - who repeated it to me) that&quot;the Central Empires are already ready for unconditional peace&quot;,I think that that is excessive optimism or pessimism.   The desirefor peace is most ihtjense, but it is still of so orthodox a kind asnot to run counter to, but to serve, the action of the government.Besides, the whole action of tho governments for eight months  past
 is such as to confirm the population in the firm conviction that they neglect no means of hastening peace and are animated by an ardent desire for its conclusion.   Iir reality it is not necessary to assume that the pacifist intrigues,  which the Central Empires are working to spread everywhere, are more petty  Machiavellian tricks intended to fool the Entente-   Berlin and Vienna desire peace, and their strengthafc present lies just in the fact fnat for them peace is a concrete and immediate  aim, w&amp;ile the weakness of the Entente lies in the fact that for it peace is still a theoretical and distant aim, a kind of undated hill of exchange.     In this pacifist action Austria has for the present taken the initiative.    The demarches undertaken in the spring and summer of last year in Switzerland by Andrassy and Karolyi were not part of this plan, but may have contributed in some way to open up the way for it.    Andrassy in particular had indirect contact with certain Prtnch political circles which had an active part in the recent affair.    He did not advance matters because that was not his intention,  since the little he  did and the rumours of it sufficed as a manoeuvre at Berlin in favour of his party; and it will be remembered that at that very time he was in fact invited  - to the German headquarters, and it seemed as though his hour was coming.   But his activity at that time served in any case to arouse hopes which were later to be of  help to Goluchowski.     Goluchowski was the first who came to Switzerland with a directmandate, which was mainly of the nature of preliminary skirmishing. It was in consequence of. Goluchowskfa  work of &quot;sounding&quot; thatVienna in agreement with Berlin decided on systematic action.    The Austrian propaganda in Switzerland was  considerably reinforced and disposed of a net of agents, linking up the various centres  which might be of use and mobilising those who could help to establish new points of contact.   Baron Oscar do Montlong - a personago much in evidence at the Ballplatz, former secretary to the ;
Austro-Hungarian delegation to the Conference of Algeciras, thenhead of-the official press bureau of the Foreign Office and knownfor his share in preparing the Prochaska affair - was sent toGeneva if not to direct,  at any rate to supervise the movement.Montlong  was sent as Consul General and got it whispered aboutthat this was a pretext  for removing him from Vienna where hewas no longer persona grata.    The curious thing is that nonethe less  the former Consul, Merle, has remained at Geneva andcontinues calmly to carry on hio consular functions, whileMontlong, who never sets  foot in the Consulate, lives in a villaoutside Geneva close to the Trench frontier with a small 3uiteof secretaries and officials.   His right hand is Dr. Leo Szemereforeign editor of the Heues Pester Journal.   There is no doubtthat Montlong is actively engaged in espionage; but there isequally  little doubt that he is also actively engaged in a workof political penetration  which tends to get in touch with Prancethrough the loyally Austrophile financial $nd journalistic groupsin Geneva. -  It is enough to refer to .in interview in the Tribunedo Geneve (incidentally the only Geneva paper directly sub-ventioned by the French), in which Montlong expressed his sympathytowards France and which  was his first debut in his new office.The little nest of agents working either round Montlong or directlyunder the. Berne legation, where the new Minister, von Musulin,was sent  a few months ago to replace Gagern, evidently with a viewto providing somo one more suited to the requirements of the newplan - does not count any more, especially at Geneva.   It is ofcourse not always easy to distinguish voluntary from authorisedagents, but in both cases the aim is to instil, in France, throughneutrals  or directly through Frenchmen,  the idea that Austria-Hungary might be detached from Germany and renewed on a federalbasis such as would offer guarantees to the Allies that the Germanelements  would in future  be paralysed by the rise of other elements
 in  short tno idoaS&apos;-of-th^-n6^^ published some time ago in I^Oouvre and now known to be written by  a certain Fresh de Jelsh, a man of very slight weight and  in himself innocuous.   Among the most active and voluntary inter--mediaries in these Austrian intrigues must be counted the Poles and the  olnische Press Bureau in Berne, a propaganda office  which is  quite Austrophile in inspiration and origin, and which after a purely journalistio period in favour of an Austrian solution  of the polish problem (apparently checked at the request of Berlin), had specialised in general Austrian propaganda, and particularly  in pacifism.   Two days before I left Switzerland the director of this bureau, a certain Dr. Karl Bador, committed suicide.   From hastily gathered information I had the impression that it was probably a case of a political suicide: at Zflrieh I also heard hints of espionage in the case.   It had been Just this Bader who last summer had been used for certain overtures towards the Hungarians which 3ibikov, of the Hussion Legation in Berne, had for a time thought of attempting but which he then dropped.     It is useless to give all the names, real or alleged, said to be  implicated in these intrigues.   Among those which are certain may be cited the group of Genevan financiers headed by Darier and Chcfcevicro: the group of Austrians under Count Golloredo-Mansfeld and his*mistress Martelli whom he has left at Geneva  since the beginning of the war: the group at Montreux round the Duchess of Madrid (it is well known that Spain, owing to the initiative  of certain Bourbon circles, has taken a fairly active part in the affair, and that the King himself is inclined to approve of it); further at Montreux the Du?chesse d!Uzes, v/ho in her turn is the beloved of Skrzinski, and who in her frequent journeys between Paris and Switzerland maintains contact between her Austrian friends and the Catholic circles of (the Duchess of) Montebello - though I am inclined to doubt this contact between them and to
regard the &quot;fole&quot; of the Duchesse d&apos;Uzes as exaggerated.   Accordingto the Catholics the Free Masons are at work and among them themost active is Askenazy, a Jew from Russian Poland, who has bothAustrian and Russian citizenship and lives at the Hotel Lorinsat Montreux.    Askenazy, who is visited by Andrassy and Goluchowski,is in contact with all the Swiss Ledges and is said to be tryingthrough them to establish channels of communication between theHungarian Lodges (in Hungary,  of the Scottish rite) and the French.I was told, though without being able to verify it, that atLausanne and Montreux certain  English ladies affiliated to theFree Masons have been v/or king  for some months.   At Montreux theHungarian Count Hunyady, brother of the Emperor&apos;s Aide-de-Camp,.has made his centre and is undoubtedly engaged in politics: he leftSwitzerland a  ew weeks ago but is expected to return.   A lessimportant personage is Crenneville, a very rich Viennese whohas many connections, kinsfolk and interests in France and en-courages them for political purposes from Switzerland.     On the French side names  are less certain.    Among thosespoken of are two members of the staff of the Temps,  who are saidto have met Viennese emissaries at the Journal de Geneve;  alsothe confidante of certain Paris bonkers who are said to have metenvoys of the Vienna bankers on the 9th May at the Hotel Metropole.Baron Guischen, an ex-diplomat and the historian Imbart de laTour are said to have connections with Austrian circles,  the go-betweens in their conversations being certain clergy of Friburg.I approached Imbart. de la Toijr when in Switzerland and got theimpression of a man convinced  of the Austrophile thesis butabsolutely unqualified from the general political point of view.He said he had come to Switzerland with an important  authorityfrom the French government and a certain reserve which I noticedin conversation in certain French circles in Berne convinced me ofthe possibility,  if not of a mission,  at least of a demarche.
 One man who has certainly had weaknesses  in this  direction  is flauefwein,. a joint director of the Mat in  who has  been  in  Switzerland several times and is expected to return.   He also had relations with the Polnische Press Bureau, and at Geneva indirect connectionsiyi-bh Austrian circles - this time through Sv/atkowski,  Geneva correspondent of the Russian Telegraphic  Agency,  a confidant of the former regime, obnoxious to the new.   Also the Geneva correspondent of the Matin, Casella, whom I regard as  absolutely unreliable, Joas always dabbled in the Austrian camp through^elements round the Martelli and other Austrophiles of  Geneva.   Of course it was not easy or possible for me to obtain details as to how deep roots such feelers may have in Paris.    At Geneva  Puinleve is spoken of as the most convinced supporter in the government of Austrophile policy.    It is said that Ribot has fallen latterly under the influence of banking and financial^irelea^^^ch--interested in Austrian industrial and shipping concerns.   However that may be, the whole of this preparatory action  culminated in the c onver sat i on at -Berne&apos; hetween Mensdor ff -and the &quot;British.. Min i st er, Rumbold, last April.   The conversation, which was asked  for by Mensdorff through an English lady  !$io is none the less our sincere friend and only yielded to Mensdorff?s importunities,  has led to nothing, because Rumbold from certain indications, such as the suggestion of a possible re-partition of Alsace,  soon realised that the thing had been prepared in agreement with the German government, and proposed to the Foreign Office (which  approved) to break off the discussion.   None the less, though this first big coup failed,  other attempts are to be expected,  perhaps in  the near future..   Certainly Vienna intends to make the most   of all elements which the internal situation may offer, beginning withPa?*3.if,mer.t ....... * . e. *..
      IV.     If, then, I were to be asked as to the results  of this last  phase  of Austro-German pacifist action, my  impression  is that its potential results are very great.   I do not  speak  of the neutrals, upon whom the affectation of certainty  assumed by our enemies has  such an effect that at Berne, for instance, I heard it quite seriously asserted that the Germans have hired for the middle of September the H$tel Belle-Vue because peace negotiations Sill  begin&apos;then.   But to leave these stubborn intrigues free scope ends by spreading even in our own camp the  pernicious feeling that the political initiative is passing  from us and that the other side alone possesses it and can make  uae of  it.    The Entente, which from a military standpoint has after two years of preparation succeeded in taking the offensive, still remains diplomatically on a defensive of the most timid,  uncertain  and short-sighted kind.   The first and keenest impression  which one has when in contact with centres open to international  opinion is that the Entente is wasting by this absurd passivity half the advantages which it could otherwise secure.   The absolute  lack of an organic plan for the development of all the sources of action and information at our disposal is sufficiently clear.   Partly With  the excuse that the ground is unfavourable (as if  in war  one could advance at all except on unfavourable ground.1), partly from laziness, partly really ov/ing to lack of ideas,  we abandoned almost completely to itself the whole of that grey zone  of minor irredentist nationalities (Poles,  Czechs, Ukrainians,  etc.)  of most of whom the enemy from the first taken advantage.    There are a thousand elements Which are no help to us because we do not  know how to use them, because when they come to us we do not know what  to say to them,because we do not answer their offers save by a tepid interest or indifference, by vague temporising which would discourage the keenest of them.   All the Entente &quot;governments are responsible for this  state of affairs, but I think that  a typical example is to be
found in our relations  with the  Serb  and Jugo-Slav world.    Theserelations are worse  than  bad,  they  are  non-existent-    At  thebeginning of the  third  year of war  and  in face of a situationwhich becomes the more  dangerous as the decisive phase approaches,we persist in maintaining towards them  the same declamatoryattitude of isolation and contempt  which characterises the happydays of the &quot;Dante Alighieri&quot;  and the &quot;Trento e Trieste&quot;.    Allour Adriatic propaganda has for  two years been left in irresponsiblehands.........  The practical result is  that when the  day comes forprompt actions, the  circles which make  Serb and Jugo-Slav  publicopinion, and for  getting  into  contact with them for mutualsuggestions,  we shall not be able to  do so because the channelsof such contact are  absolutely lacking.    Outside the Chancelleriesour political authorities have no permanent means at  their disposalfor influencing the  Southern Slavs, who are destined  to be one ofthe most interesting and  important  elements on the sea to  whoseprimacy we aspire.   This lack of interest, always culpable,becomes inconceivable now that the  Southern Slav question  seemsto be taking a  very  dangerous  form  for  us.   I do not think thatany immediate danger exists.   There  are currents and counter-currents among  the Slavs  themselves,  and the irreducible hostilityof the Magyars  and the  jealousy  of  the  Poles have to  be overcome:but the eventuality  is  there.............*     Here too we  must assume the diplomatic offensive.   Action onour part at this  moment would  perhaps fall on specially favourablesoil.   I have  found Serbs and Jugo-Slavs seriously discouraged bythe course of events in Russia,  alarmed at having to  face  a futureso uncertain for  them without  being able to count on  Russian aid.They feel that  as the first effect  of this changed state of affairstheir shares have fallen  heavily in Paris and London.    They havethe impression  of being no longer listened to:  they fear isolationand this while  the re-conquest of their country is still so problematic
   and distant.&apos;.   I had the  impression  that  they sincerely desire   a rapprochement with Italy and&apos; I  believe  that every day the moment   of &apos;noY/ or never1  has come.    If  it  succeeded,  it would be the   most deadly  and confusing act  which  we could possibly undertake   against Austria -  the only one which would really  strike at the   base of her  pacifist plans.    Of  course an accord  with the Jugo-   Slavs and Serbs is another way of saying  the necessity of defining   once for all our war aims on the  Adriatic, the need of having not   only a programme to be kept in the drawer, but also a programme   which can be discussed in the.  light  of day.     .   Y/hat is true  of Italy can also  be said of the whole Entente.   It is the Entente  as a whole which ought  to reply  to the pacifist   action of the Austro-Germans by a pacifist action  of its ownu   In short, the Entente must begin  to  will  its own peace; our   enemies will really will  their peace.  TTe pour forth declarations,   speeches o&apos;f  ministers and proclamations of kings,  solemn promises   and solemn principles: but we  have not in the whole worid a single   agent who is &quot;working up&quot; our  war aims, who is translating them   into the concrete and proper names and geographical parallels,   or contrasting them with  those of the enemy.   Hence that wide-   spread feeling that the Entente still has not the  courage to   &quot;ihill&quot; peace, a feeling which  is  making great progress even in   the public opinion of allied countries and which in view of the   recurring sacrifices and  discontent  is the most dangerous thing   Imaginable.    To my mind  the clearing of  ideas,  the passing from   theory to practice is now as necessary for the Entente as military   success.   It is the &quot;Single Political Front&quot; which it is absolutelyI  necessary to achieve.  And this  is  a real war necessity because   undoubtedly  if we allowed ourselves  to realise all our enemies1   political resources this  would have  an effect on the whole course   of the war and might yield a new and powerful co-efficient of   victory.   I believe that if the  Entente  were really capable of
undertaking seriously and in time what I have called a politicaloffensive, then even without striking home - always assuming acontinuance of offensive pressure, no relaxation of the blockadeand no further deterioration in the condition of Russia - wintermight bring us peace.     V.   To sum up my impressions under a few heads:     (l)   The internal conditions of the Central Empires are badeconomically but still good politically.     (2)   The desire for peace is intense and wide-spread but hasnot taken a subversive character.     (3)   The peace intrigues conducted recently by Austria-Hungaryare part of a complete pacifist plan.     (4)   This pJran is specially directed against us and there isurgent need for meeting it.    Among other things prompt press          . :-&apos; i           &apos;*action is needed to deal with the Austrian problem and to advocatethe solution  we desire.     (5)   A really thnfrough anti-Austrian action is impossiblet/ithout the agreement, at least in principle, with the Serbs andJugo-Slavs.     (6)   The Entente must  organise and identify its action onpolitical grounds,  as it has already done on military grounds.   Itshould unify  its forces, define its aims and transform its politicalaction from the defensive to the offensive.   &apos;     (7)  .This political offensive must take the concrete formof an action  for peace.     If prepared on firm foundations and energetically pushed, suchan action might upset  the peace plans of our enemies and sensiblyhasten the end of the war.     (8)   V/ithout such action, unless an unexpected turn ofmilitary events should transform our present victory of pressureinto a victory of collapse,  another year of war seems to me in-evitable.                                                 P. TO.
     Attention is drawn to two apparent inaccuracies in thisotherwise admirable report:  (l)   The alleged meeting betweenSir Horace Rumbold and Count Mensdorff does not appear to havetaken place (see Foreign Office telegrams from Berne regardingthe rumour).    (2)   Dr. Bader has not committed suicide as aPolish acquaintance of mine saw him in Berne within the lastfortnight.   The author of the memorandum must have confusedhim with some other individual.R.W.S.W.
