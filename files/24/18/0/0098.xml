Mr. Barnes,- who was the only Memberpresent at the War Cabinet who is not also a Member of theWar Policy Committee had agreed to this course  In orderto ensure accuracy in details I consulted Sir Eric Geddes,and he asked that the&apos; final decision on this point might bepostponed for a day or two as he wishes to obtain the agree-ment of the Eirst Sea Lord and the Shipping Controller tothe principle of the Report before the next stage is taken.,He also wishes the War Cabinet to see the Report and to havean opportunity of explaining to them personally preciselywhat he desires the Committee to do.  Consequently, I havepostponed the matter until early next week.                             (Initialled).  M0P.A0H.2 Whitehall Gardens, &apos;S-.fr*      6th July,  1917..
