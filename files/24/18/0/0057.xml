2r 9SEC RE T.       -G.T. 1257.                        WAR CABIMiT .                     -  IEDIA1T REFORMS .V         KO^JY^TP; SECRETARY - Off&apos; STATE&quot; FOR &apos;-IHDIA.(Circulatedwith reference to War;&apos;.Cabinet 172,  Minute 13.)      With reference to the question  of Indian Reform,  Iunderstood that the Cabinet proposed  to resume the discussionat the earliest possible moment after the return of thePrime Minister.  It will be remembered that General Smutsdesired to make some observations and I think that the.Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had not fully developedhis ideas.  My own formula is simple  and the more informallyit could be announced the better I   jhould be pleased.Elaboration of the formula would only become necessary ifthe Cabinet decides that qualifications and restrictions suchas are in any case necessary,  must  be embodied in the formulaitself.  Under the cireurns bances it is necessary that Ishould know more of the mind and intention of the Governmentbefore I develop a formula.  I hope,  therefore,  that thediscussion of Indian reforms will be  resumed as early aspossible.  I think the  Secretaries  have been misled by mysuggestion, made in the course of the discussion,  that whenthe Cabinet had decided upon the object of Indian reforms Ishould consult with Lord Curzon as  to the form in which theirdecision should be expressed.                                         ( Sd.)  AUST3F-CHAMBERLAIN2nd July,  1917.
