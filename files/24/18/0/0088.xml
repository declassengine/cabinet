Following  from  Colonel Langlois, French  Liasion    Officer  at Russian General Headquarters, dated 30th  June.            Terenteheske made following declaration  to me -    Begins -  &quot;I consider success of offensive on South-West Front    will  determine a change in the situation, although only a    partial  offensive  it should he supported by action of the    Allies -  the great offensive is contemplated for September.            I consider that if Turkey were put&quot; out of action it    would mean the beginning of the end for Germany.  With this    object in view we  shall at an early date attack the Turks in    the Caucasus.   Moreover if the RsssxaH Roumanian offensive    is successful, it  is Brussilov&apos;s intention, while advancing    in the direction of Bucharest, to concentrate in the Bobudja    5 or  6 Army Corps  to deal a death blow to Turkey.  I desire    therefore that the Conference of the 10th July should    recommend that the Salonika force should be maintained up to    strength and that an offensive should be made on the    Macedonian front.&quot;i           We are expecting that an outburst of patriotism  */  -  will  shortly take place&quot; - Beclaration ends.            Terentcheske1s declaration not being accompanied    by precise facts is transmitted as received.
