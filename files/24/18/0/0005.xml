/r   iHONOURS FOR THE ilERCANTILE MARINE-1/3Note by the President of the Board of Trade.     It has not hitherto been customary to put forwardnames of representatives of the Mercantile Marine for   *places in the Honours List.  But the services renderedby the Mercantile Marine to the country during the warhave been so great that it is a question whether theyshould not receive regular recognition in the HonoursList in the same way as representatives of otherimportant interests.   Both officers and men are verymuch strained at present,  and their feeling rather isthat they receive a number of compliments from Ministersand others,  but nothing tangible.    The bestowal of afew honours on leading representatives of captains andengineers would have a very gpod effect.     If this is agreed to in principle,  the CM,Or.  wouldbe a fitting distinction to bestow in view of the world-wide nature of the service.   The Board of Trade couldobtain confidentially,  in consultation with the owners,the names of a few outstanding captains and engineersWho are admittedly at the head of  their profession.     It is suggested that the first list migfrt containfour names,  two captains and two engineers,  who areeither at sea now or have only just recently left thesea,  and that after that it might  be made the practiceto put forward two names each year,  one captain aixi  oneengineer.                                     .    A.  H.  S.                                         28.6.17.
