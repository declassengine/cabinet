AGW/OIO.DEPARTMENT OF INFOPiMATION       OTELXIOEUCE BUREAU.              WEEKLY   REPORT   OH   GERMANY.       June  18th  to  July  2nd, 1917-   1t             It did  not  seem  necessary to  write  a rexport last       week  as there were no  events  in  Germany  oi  any special impor-       tance.   What political  discussion there has heen in the       press since then continues  to be baffling and  embarrassing       and affords little clear guidance    In  particular it may be       noted that there has been comparatively  little discussion as       to the Scheidemann peace proposals, and  nothing has appeared       about them which could be interpreted as expressing the       official view.                  Scheidemann himself,  however, on June 24, published       an article in the  Yorwarts  in which he discussed the result       of his mission to  Stockholm.    I21 it he  does not explain, or       even  refer to,  his own programme, but the article is impor-       tant  beoause it seems  to chow that he is now  dissociating       himself  from the Government.    He complains that the Govern-       ment  refused to accept his  advice and that, now that the       result of  this is  becoming apparent, they are  trylng-ijo ^throw       the blame  upon the Socialists:            &quot;We  demanded  of the Government in the  last Reichstag          debate  that without further shuffling they should openly          adopt peace without annexations or indemnities.   We did          not demand that they  should declare themselves for such          a  peace with Russia alone.   We challenged them to adopt          other ways than those which have had  the almost universal          result  of awaking distrust abroad.   We  challenged the          Government to give  one clear pronouncement  and then to          await  the result.   We did not ask them  to  repeat the          incomplete pronouncement of December  to  one party onlyi(f        The Government  did not follow our advice,  and after          having experienced some disappointment in  consequence,          they hold up a threatening finger to  us.&quot;
        The last sentences are difficult to understandprecisely, hut the general effect is clear.        The main point of difference seems to have beenthat bcheidemann urged on the Government that they shouldmake advances to Russia in favour of a general peace;  theGovernment, instead of doing this, tried to entangle theRussians into a separate peace.    The same point is madeby Theodor Wolff in the Berliner Tageblatt, June 25,   Ina letter addressed to Professor Fdrster he says;     &quot;How could we disagree with you when you say the   strongest grounds of immediate political cleverness   ought to have moved the German Government to approach   the Russians, not in the sense of a one-sided German-   Russian entente, but with a clear European programme.   In that the German statesmanship again and again indi-   cated to the Russians, at last even in the Norddeutsehe,   with too obvious emphasis that they would not take   anything foroibly from Russia, they awakened the im-   pression that they wanted &apos;co  act differently with the   Allies of Russia and thereby they prevented those in   power at Petrograd from exercising an effective pres-   sure upon their Allies and, as a matter of course,   called out more and more definite declarations of   loyalty to her Allies from Russia.&quot;        We get then the important point that Socialist andLiberal opinion in Germany wished to use the Russian Revolu-tion as the lever for bringing about a general peace, butthat the German Government missed the opportunity by using^ more &apos;SUQ merely in an endeavour to detach the Russiansfrom the Allies.        (In the last report, dealing with the Grimm-Hoffmannepisode, it was stated that the  offer of peace contained init was not for a separate peace  with Russia, but the.t thoRussian Allies are included.   This is based on an errorwhich has been explained by later publications.    It isclear that the message from Herr Hoffmann to Grimm, whichwe cannot doubt was a verbal repetition of what had beenconveyed to him from the German Government, was purely for
a separate peace with Russia.    This message was followedby the sentence;  &quot;I am convinced that if the Allies ofRussia desire it, Germany and her Allies would be readyimmediately to open peace negotiations&quot;, but this sentence,which expands the offer to one for general peace, is clear-ly an addition by Hoffmann himself beyond that which he wasauthorised to make.)        Scheidemann, in his article, after dissociatinghimself from the Government in regard to war-aims, drawsthe moral from what he had seen and heard at Stockholm,that Germany must at once democratise her institutions:     &quot;You are one of the most thoa?ougitly educated peoples   in the world and you must not stick to principles of   Government which belong and are suited only to the   childhood era of the world&apos;s development.   Only when   you achieve reform in this, will ,you have found the   way you seek - the. way to universal independence be-   tween peoples&quot;.He defends the policy of the Socialists which has beenthroughout to advocate democratic reform as a spontaneousmovement in Germany and points out how, by the neglect ofthis advice, Germany has been put in an unfavourablesituation as regards other countries.     &quot;Although over-stated, the fact of 1here autocracy   and there democracy&apos; has been plainly put forward, and   who can deny the effects it may have?......we Social   Democrats took up the cry long before there was any   thought of v/ar, and then from the first day of war   declared that freely-given reform was the speediest   way to peace.   Only much later, when the enemy   noticed that Germany could move neither backwards nor   forwards in this matter of Heuorientierunff, when Russia   achieved her gigantic revolution and America entered   the war, were we faced with the humiliating fact of   having our own demand for it imposed upon us from   outside on the part of the enemy war-formula.   To   this move, perhaps the cleverest on the part of the   enemy, there is but one counter-stroke.   Germany, who   stands safe to the four winds, and who has yielded to   the dictation of no conqueror, must grant her own   reform to her own people.&quot;
           On both points then -  peace terms  and reform atborne - Herr Scheidemann seems to  intend from  now onwards toplace himself at the head of a definite democratic movement,and proposes to bring strong pressure upon the Government;this has been made clear in a later speech;   addressing theCommittee of the German Social Democratic Party, he said:     &quot;Now the Government must show its true colours.   It   was wrong in offering the Russians in successive weeks,   bit by bit, more favourable terms for a separate peace.   It must no longer hesitate to  prove before all the world   by deeds,that it is in earnest about the new orientation,   we require to complete our political freedom and to over-   come distrust abroad of German declarations and inten-   tions.&quot;           We have abundant evidence that the dissatisfactionwith the internal workings of the German Constitution,which wasvery marked among liberal educated and professional men beforethe war, especially in Berlin and in South Germany, is againreviving.   Evidence of this is to be seen,  though expressedgenerally with extreme academic caution, in the FrankfurterZeitung, and more forcibly in the Berliner Tageblatt;  thispoint is of course strongly advocated by the  South Germandemocrats who now make their home in Switzerland and useSwiss papers to publish their opinions.   The practicalquestion is how much real political purpose and couragethere is.behind them;  by themselves these Liberals have hadin the past comparatively little  political importance;  if,however, they were to unite themselves on this matter withthe Socialists, and give as it were a respectable bourgeoiscovering to the S6cialists, the movement might have a seriousimportance.   That which has so long delayed  Liberal-Demo-cratic reform in Germany is the rupture between Liberals andSocialists.           It is to be anticipated that if Scheidemann placeshimself at the head of a real democratic movement, he will,
at any rate,  not succeed in keeping the allegiance of the moreextreme Imperialist Socialists;   if then.the split in theSocialist Party, which was  foreshadowed in the weekly reportof June 11-18,  takes place, Scheidemann will not he found inthe right wing  which secedes (if it does so)Awith the mainblock.    If he  carries through the policy which he indicates,this will mean  that at the  meeting of the Heichstag, which isnow announced to take place this week,  the combined Socialistswill take a more uncompromising position than they have latelydone, and as has already been suggested, there will be increasedbitterness in the conflict  between them and the Conservatives.l&apos;his may possibly lead to serious internal difficulties inGermany, which  will be watched with much interest.   At thesame time, it is interesting to note that the indecision and  difference of opinion in  the National Liberal Party appearsto be increasing.   This will all add to the difficulties ofthe Government.           In two Consecutive numbers the Frankfurter Zeitunghas announced that it is no longer permitted to discuss poli-tical affairs:-     &quot;On grounds which cannot be publicly stated, we see   ourselves obliged to cause our political section to appear,   until further notice, without our own expression of opinion.&quot;It is at the moment of writing uncertain whether this inhibi-tion is peculiar to the frankfurtert or whether it appliesto the whole press.   This  action seems anyhow to indicatethat the Government are beginning to regard the internalpolitical situation with serious apprehension.           Tie have recently received accounts of the internalcondition of Germany coming from many different sources.  Theyare all in agreement as representing the want of food as ex-tremely serious, and many of the private communications are
very painful reading.   It is noticeable also that we nowhave statements that the soldiers at the front do not receivesufficient food.   The prospects of the harvest, which wereunsatisfactory, seem to be improving, but at the best it will,owing to shortage of labour and to the drought, be below theaverage.   Everything seems to show that the pressure is tend-ing to reach an extreme point, and the relief v/hich will comewith the new harvest will probably only be temporary, i.e.the amount of food available will not be sufficient to carryon for another year, and therefore rationing will have to.continue on a very strict scale.           At the same time, all accounts agree also in this,that the people, certainly in fforth Germany, are deadened bythe distress, and there seems little expectation of any activemovement against the Government so long as the war lasts.This view is also taken by the Socialists:,     &quot;Borgbjerg was asked ii there would be before long a   revolution in Germany, and if that could be counted on.   He replied that, according to his belief, there would   certainly be no revolution in Germany during the war,   because the whole people were united in the belief it   had saved its skin.   As to whether there would be a   revolution after the war, that depended on the outcome   of the struggle and the granting of political rights.   The Russians, he added, must not believe that a revolu-   tion like theirs was possible in Western Europe.   Only   a social revolution could be taken into consideration by   Western European States.&quot;It is not quite clear whether this will be equally true ofSouth Germany;  we have for instance notioe of great discon-tent at Hanau and in the neighbourhood of Frankfurt;  also atMsseldorf there were riots on June 28.   It must be remem-bered that in the South German manufacturing districts thereIs much more of the habit and spirit of revolution and dis-order than in Prussia, where the weight of the Government ismuch more strongly felt and effectively exercised.
           We  have  also  received  statements  coming from various miscellaneous  sources  that  there  is  great  apprehension in mer- cantile,  commercial and  financial circles, and timers  is no doubt  that they--are more and more occupied with the difficul-. ties which confront the nation after peace is  rnc.de.    It is said that the  ultimote control is entirely in  the  hands oi the military, and  this  Is  causin-. discontent among brnkers and merchants.   while  no  single statement  comes from  any very authoritative  sources, there is *-  general  agreement in the picture drawn, which is one, a pjriori,  cuite pzobable.    If then the  failure to come to any understanding  with hussia and the disappointment  caused b^ the  cppcrent  inadequacy  of the submarine campaign, are followed,  as appears to be indicated, by a strengthening  of  the military aspect, by  restraint on public discussien of political affairs, and  by a new  political campaign  undertaken by the Socialists,/and if,  side by side with this, the nation  is confronted  by  another year1s warfare, in which  there is no relaxation of the  hardships they hcve been undergoing, there will be very  violent  attacks on the ruling classes.   These will take the iorm at  first of rn attack on the  Agrarians;  they will  be  coupled with   demrnd for immediate  constitutional reform  and,by decrees, the idea will make itself felt  in the country, that -this would help towards the attaining  of a satisfactory peace.   Ve may there- fore conceivably be near the beginning  of  some  collapse in the internal cohesion -           One thing which is cuite  ole&amp;r is tost  the  Censer- vative Party will not give way in the least, whether  as to peace aims or  as to internal development;  the  nearer  the crisis comes,  the more signs there o.re  that  the desire  both for peace and  reform is growing,  the acuter will their  position
become, and those who have followed the history 01 the PrussianConservatives in the jiast, will understand that they wouldshrink from no measures and *ould prefer even civil war or acoup d&apos;etat, to surrender^           It need not be said that the internal developmentin Germany will depend much on the maintenance of a seriousrestraint in all statements, whether by public men 01 by thepress, in all the JLLlied countries: though it is of course notsuggested that there should be the slightest symptom of surren-der on essential points.   The lan^ua^e used by the PrimeMinister in bis recent speech seems to be exaotly what wasrequired, and comment on it will be looked for with interest.The comment we have already received cannot be properly judgeduntil we know whetber the speech was telegraphed in full, orwhether, as is more probable, fcfeai the writers are dependingupon a garbled version.    ).hat we have so far is violent in-veotive from the extremist press;  this is not a bad sign;it probably implies that the writers are seriously frightenedat the effect of the encouragement given to the democraticmovement and, in order to prevent this having any influence,are deliberately perverting the general effect of the speech.                                   ;J. Yf. H                                   3rd July,  1917.&apos;
