CONFIDENTIAL.             WAB CABINET.         f(J !T. 1240.    -&quot;*&quot;             .  NOTE BY THE SECRETARY.           In&quot;The Times&quot; of. tho .19thJune, Mr.-Hodge is reportedto hare Baldwin a speech in proposing the health of the Chairmanat a luncheon at the Savoy Hotel, given in honour of the Premierof New South Wales      &quot;\\      6.       &quot;......... I made application the other day to be supplied        With the whole of the Minutes of the War Council, and    .    they thought it was not advisable that I should get them.        That is not the way to keep up the spirit of the people        of this country.   Those who are in a. position of     ^responsibility ought.to be trusted, to.&apos; know what is going     ,   on, and if they oannot be trusted they ought not to be       - there         -; In view of the foregoing I think that the Memhers ofthe War Cabinet should see the following correspondence which. Ihare had with Mr.Hodge on the subject.   I have already mentionedthe correspondence verbally,                              (Signed)  M.P.A.Hankey.2, Whitehall GardenB,  S.W.       2nd.July,  1917.1. Copy of letter dated 8th June, 1917 from Mr.Hodge               to Sir Maurice Eankoy.Dear Sir Maurice Hankey,        I should be glad if you could kindly arrange for a completeset of the Minutes of the Y^sr Cabinet to be sent to me regularlyas issued.   At present, I receive e^rtraets from the Minutes,on all matters affecting labour questions,  but it is difficultto keep in touch with tho Government!s labour policy from thedisjointed decisions to which alone 1 am allowed access, apartfrom their oontoxt.                 7          Tours very truly,                             ..( Sdl-:John Hodge.         2. Copy of letter dated 11th June,  1917 from              Sir Maurice Hankey to Mr.Hodge.Dear Mr.Hodge,           I have no authority to send a complete set of theMinutes of the ^ar Cabinet except to an extremely limited number
 $ of persons decided on &quot;by Minutes of the War Cabinet itself.   Up to now the War Cabinet have shown the utoost reluctance   to extend the list of complete Minutes at all, as if it is   extended it is difficult to fix the number of complete copies   within reasonable limits.   If you &apos;j?ress it, however, I will   submit your request to the War.Cabinet.         As you should.at present receive all Minutes on questions   des ling with or affecting labour, I do not think that you would   obtain verjr much additional information on the subject by a   complete set of the Cabinet Minutest  whioh, of course, deal   with questions of Uaval,. Military,  foreign and Colonial Policy,   end the large shipping questions raised by the submarine warfare,   and very many othor questions.         My instructions to, my Assistant Sooretarlos, on -whom the.   detailed work of distribution of Minutes-, falls, are to err  .   on the side of distributing [too widely rathor then too narrowly,   and I will have- a reminder sent round that thi3 is to beI   observed in the case of the Minister  of Labour.         I need hardly add that I myself, or, if I am engaged,   one of my Assistant Secretaries, will be always glad to call   on you or to meet your representative in order to give any   further information, which we hare at  our disposal on questions   of labour policy.                          if ours&apos; sincerely,                              (3d)  M.P.A.Hankey.3.  Copy of letter dated 13th June, 1917 from Mr.Ho&amp;go           :  to Sir Maurice Htmkey.   Dear  Sir Maurice Heukey,           Many  thanka  for  your  le 11er  of the: 11 th.inst.    I   note  that you  propose to  send  a reminder to your Assistant   Secretarial  to the  effect that  everything which concerns the   Ministry of  Labour  shall  be  sent to me.   I hope this may   neat  the case,  and  for the time being I  will not press  for   my requett to  be submitted to  the War Cabinet.          . Aa  on illustration  of the difficulty  I have in mind,    &apos;   I may mention  that  two Memoranda on. :  seeruiting were submitted   by the Wer Office tc  the  War Cabinet  last week.   Though the   matters raised therein;were  of immediate.concern to  thia   Department,1  did. not receive.  copies, and it was only by chance   that  I discovered!these Memoranda were in existence.    I then   asked that copies should  be  sent to me.   As you will fully   appreciate it  is very undesirable that I should  have to rely\) on information which  1 receive  in a haphazard way, and  it does   not oonduca  to effective  work by the-Ministry  of Labour.                            Yours very  sincerely,(3d) John Hodge.
