OPERATIONS.VF   Q   OFrom:- General Delme R add iff e,             Comando Supremo, Italy,T*:-   C.I.G.S.4-7-1917.Des.  3 a,m, 5th.216.                 Personal and Secret.  -       To-day- I saw General Gadorna In Carnia.  He said that-hisstatements regarding field guns represented his requirements in the&apos;event of his having.-to act on the defensive.   He noted that youwere unable to help him in this respect.       As regards Italian great offensive, he said that end ofJuly was too early and that it could not begin before August.       Ho said that his chief requirement for the offensive was-heavy artillery and ammunition, but he would not say that 25additional batteries would suffice.  He said he was planning a greatoffensive from Tolmino to the sea, since it was only by an offensiveon this scale that he could be sure of obtaining, a decisive success.However, he said that General Cappollo, who was in charge of thesector from Tolmino to Gorizia had reported that he had been forcedto limit his front of attack to the area between Canale and Gorizia andthat ho would require about 400 more heavy guns&apos; In.order to attack $nthe whole front selected. General Cadorna said that, as planned,.hisoperation would require- employment of 600,000 men and about 5,000pieces of artillery including light artillery, trench mortars.&amp;c,In consequence, it would represent a very great effort on ths  partof tho Italian army, which he could not afford to undertake, withouta reasonable prospect of success, as, apart from the military  die -advantage of non-success, a very serious repercussion might be broughtabout in the country by a failure. Consequently, he might be forcedto consider whether it would be wise for him to avoid taking the.riskand to continue to hold the 42 Austrian divisions on the Italianfront as being, under the,circumstances the best method of making hie                                                contribution                                                            Y/P
contribution to the.Allied cause,  He pointed out, however, thatthe present Russian offensive might bring about a change in thesituation.  It would make a great difference if, in particular theAustrians were to withdraw from the Italian front any eonilderafclequantity of their artillery,  He would be able to take theoffensive if this happexied/        He said he was very glad to hear that plenty of ammunitioncould be sent for the batterleg in Italy now and hoped thai youmay find it possible to send some further batteries of heavyartillery.        ?/ith reference to the statements regarding Austrianreinforcements reported in my telegram 159 Cadorna pointed outthat the number of divisions referred to represented what Austrianshad already brought as reinforcements and what it was believedtheir General Staff meant to send in addition. If it shouldbecome clear that the Russians would exercise no further pressure.        As regards the letter to the Prime Minister, Cadorna saidhe hoped to speak to you in Paris about it.  He said he wouldarrive in..Paris on. July 15th and. wished to know if you would, alsobe there.
