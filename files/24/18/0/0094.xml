On south-west front the offensive commenced with anattack by the left flank of the 11th Army, which attained allthe objectives allotted to it.   The right flank of the 7thArmy is now attacking with Brzejany as objective.  If this issuccessfully accomplished, the offensive of the 11th Army willbe continued in a north-west direction.   Simultaneously ademonstration will be carried out on the western front.  TheRussian losses have been heavy,- especially amongst  officersbut Chief of Staff tells me that the spirit of the  troops isexcellent  9 German officers and 1,700  men are amongst thetotal of prisoners.         To-day the General Quarter-Master here told me thatthe result of the success is already having an effect here asto-day 2 men who spoke in the levski against war wereimmediately seized and one nearly torn to pieces, while theother was rescued by the militia from being thrown  into acanal.  He says the Bolsheviki will redouble their  effortsto cause trouble as they are bent on causing bloodshed whichhe says is bound to come*   The Ghief of Staff is alsoconvinced the situation here cannot be put right withoutbloodshed.   I asked both the Chief of Staff and the General.Quarter-Master as to the possibility of  the Russians doinganother winter campaign.   The former said it all dependedon whether the government adopted a firm attitude.   If they .did, the Russins could go on.  He said they were now in a
position to adopt a firm attitude, as General PolovtseYhad definitely told them that there were now sufficienttroops in the garrison on which they could rely.   Themajority of the troops in the garrison refused to takepart in the demonstration yesterday, which according tothe General Quarter-Master, was a defeat of the Bolsheviki.It is worth noting that all Ministers left Petrograd forthe day yesterday.The Oommander-in-Chief of Petrograd district.
