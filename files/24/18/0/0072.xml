I have just received Amir&apos;s  reply  to  my letter of8th June  (vide Foreign Secretary&apos;s letter  of same  date) in which 1 said.chastisement of Mahsuds could  be deferred no  longer, and  invited his co-operation in preventing spread of disturbance.   Reply which is couched inmost friendly terms concludes :--   [R.] &quot; God willing I shall not spare my efforts&apos;in this respect as  far aslies within my power.&quot;        ,   We have  independent  evidence from Mahsuds themselves that he hasbeen as good as his word.
