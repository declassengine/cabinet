s ^^^j^^          of His Britannic Majesty^  ovemment]. I; Printed for the War Cabinet. July 1917;9 9 q4 a.O-SECRET,-  INDIAN  SELF-GOVERNMENT.    AT - a recent  meeting of the War Cabinet the question wasraised  as to the meaning  that is in our minds when we speak  ofself-government for India within the Empire as the goal, of ouraspirations.  It was suggested that the formulas so far put forwardhave not been altogether satisfactory, and that fresh attempts mightbe forthcoming.  I shall hot attempt to crystallise in a phrase ideasthat are probably incapable of precise or narrow definition; but, forthe possible aid of those who are engaged in such a task and  inorder to clear our own minds,  I will  state &quot;what is  my generalconception of the end that we have in view.    What do we mean by self-government for India ?   We do notmean that India, either now or in any future that can be reasonablypredicted, will  become  a single  autonomous or quasi-autonomouspolitical  unit, in which Indians will be universally substituted forBritish  administrators, and  the 250 millions of Indian peoples ofevery race, religion, and  state of development-outside the Native&apos;States-will  constitute  a   self-governing  dominion  under thesuzerainty, either more or less effective, of the British Crown.   Suchan aspiration, in the present  phase of Indian evolution, is the wildestof dreams ; and the belief that it can be attained, almost at a bound,is doomed to irretrievable disappointment.    Neither do we  mean  that  India  can  be resolved into  anorganised federation  of autonomous States under the.control of aFederal  Government at  Delhi  or elsewhere.   That  also  is  animpracticable ideal.    What we do  mean  is  that the area in which self-governmentexists shall be extended step by step, that the powers of self-govern-ment shall be enlarged, that the number of Indians who participatein  self-government  shall  steadily  increase  until a  time arriveswhen  Indian  representative  opinion, trained  and  moulded  byexperience, will have a predominant influence in the administrationof the country.    This is not to  say that India will ever possess the same form ofself-government as exists- in other parts of the - British Empire.There  is no  analogy between the circumstances or  the  needs.Neither is it to  say that self-government will be won by  India as awhole.  It may be that different forms and degrees of self-govern-ment will be attained in different parts, some more and  others lessadvanced; for it is idle to suppose that the same  measure can  beconceded to hill  tribes in a primitive  state of civilisation,  or  toturbulent frontier  clans, as it might be to advanced and educatedcommunities.   It  may  be  that  in the  march towards the  self-governing ideal the political unity  of India may be disintegratedand  may assume  different  shapes.   But of one thing we may  besure,  it would  disappear altogether if the Protecting Power werewithdrawn;  and  no language should  be  used that  might eveninferentially encourage such a belief.  Those who are familiar withthe  shibboleths of the  West  hardly realise that the  continuedexistence of that power is the one  guarantee for the liberties, the
rights,  and  the^&apos;progressive  emancipation ;of  tker: Indian  masses,and that to  withdraw  this  protection from  them would be  themost reactionary, as well as the most culpable, of crimes.     What can and ought to be done is to increase steadily, not byfits and starts, but by a  continuous  progression, the share- that is.taken by Indians in the government of  their country.   The rate -ofadvance will be measured  by their own capacity,  as. tested  byexperience;  and the judges of the advance must  be the BritishGovernment,  who  are  charged  with the  destinies  of the,Indianpeoples.  Not until representative  institutions in India, .which  arestill almost an  exotic, requiring the most careful  nursing,  havestruck  much  deeper roots into the  soil;   not until they are repre-sentative of a far. widei\section of-the. community, than the narrowbut  powerful factions . by whom they are  at  present controlled andrun; . not until  India, through these institutions, has  shown  herability to manageher domestic/ concerns, andis. in. a ,positionfwithHer&quot; own,, resources to . guarantee. ;the preservation .of. internal peaceand order.;, and, above.:all,-not,:unless;she.has;the.organisedvforceswhich.will render.,her,immune.from;external attack,^wilLshe.be,ina, position, to^claim.., the,:rights .of..:a.,self-goydernmginatipn. - -Therecan;:be, no. ..excuse  for. conceding, or,even,promising a iorm ,pf ..selfr.government, under, which, the fabric of internal order-would -crumble.at-the first.shack,;,and which would - leave  her frontiers by land andsea at the mercy of.a foreign enemy.  ./             ., -        -s^ln-:     Liberal as our  concessions .may..and . ought to be,: I  hopetherefore that it may be; made, plain  that we have no intention, todivest.ourselves. of the ; responsibility -which, we&apos; have :-,assum&apos;ed:/forthe.guidance of India on^the..path,.of ?moral and,-material advancermenfc.. ^But. in. thatitask we - maywelk invite!; a -closer, and;, more -responsible co-operation. .,,It:.will be by ,the-combined efforts of: thetwo peoples,, by the. adaptation of ,w[est.ern.experiejacie.:to-: the^genius .of ..the, eastern. mind,  by... the ^recognition-  of, equality of. -claim astested by^deserti; and? above. all; by ithe.increased participation^, of.Indians, imofficial. as; welLas  pffiGial,.npr.-rner.ely-in  the.  political,-butin-, the social, industrial,, and. material progress of their, country,- that.India will move forward  along the  path that leads  to the distantgoal.                                                  -:,  \n- A -                 v  .                      .  ..    .  c.  of k .
