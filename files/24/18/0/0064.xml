           ^WEEKLY REPORT OH BULGARIA.  X.                  July 3, 1917.  .Reflections on Stockholm Conference.     Two members of the &quot;Broad&quot;  Socialist Delegation to Stockholm,Pastukhov and Asen Tsankov,  have now returned to Sofia and havebeen giving interviews to Bulgarian papers.  Their point of view,as expressed by Tsankov,  is  that the formal conferences theyheld with the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee and many informalconversations they had with  German, Neutral and Russian Socialistsin Stockholm have done great good  to the Bulgarian cause.Tsankov argues that the Bulgarian  claims must be stated in sucha way as to show all the Great Powers that their interests willnot be injured by their realisation, but rather that the resultwould be the definite extinction of that &quot;volcano&quot;, the Balkanquestion.  He declares that  the  impression he met with everywherewas that peace was urgently  demanded and must come.  He is veryindignant with the two &quot;Narrow&quot;  Socialists, Kolarov and. Kirkov,and declares that their intrigues  met with no success.  The pointof view of these Narrow Socialists is that an indispensablepreliminary to peace is the  outbreak in all countries of asocialist revolutionary movement.   They declare that the MajoritySocialists everywhere are mere Government agents,,  and that thesuccess of  -their negotiations would mean the strengthening of theirvarious Governments&apos; positions.     The terms put forward by the  Austrian and Hungarian Socialists,especially their advice to Bulgarian and Serbian Socialists tocome to terms on  the Macedonian question, have aroused consider-able indignation in Bulgaria.  All parties in Bulgaria unite toreject the suggestions.  Bulgarians declare that Macedonia,
Dobrogea and the &quot;Bulgarian districts of the Morava Valley&quot;must he secured to Bulgaria before there can be any prospect ofpermanent peace in the Balkans.Relations with Central Europe.     Before leaving Vienna on his return from his tour in Germanyand Austria-Hungary, Dr Radoslavov gave another interview to theNeue Freie Presse (June ?A)\  As regards the relations betweenAustria-Hungary and Bulgaria he spoke as follows:-     &quot;Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria have for a long time beenfriendly countries owing to common interests, intercourse, andespecially improved mutual acquaintance, most naturally broughtabout through the Danube.  In and&apos; through the world-war ourfriendship has grown to an alliance as firm as a rock, and nowwe can at last clasp hands as neighbours over the Ivloraya Valley.To be neighbours like this war-, an indispensable necessity forus, and it must one day be attained.   IThat have Bulgariansrelations with Austria-Hungary not suffered from the fact thatthe Serbians placed themselves between us? .....Now the wayfrom Bulgaria to the West and vice versa is free, and this freedomhas been attained without any injury to the principle of nationalitywhich the Entente incessantly has on its lips&quot;.The retention of a common frontier with Austria-Hungary has, there-fore, become an avowed object of Bulgarian policy.,     That, however, the Bulgarians are too wily to. abandon them-selves entirely to foreign direction is. shown by a somewhatsarcastic article in the Llir, criticising some of the absurditiesof the Pan-Turanian propaganda carried on from Budapest.The policy of this paper (Geshovfs organ) has always been to holdthe balance between Germany and Russia,  and to hope  for a recon-ciliation between these two with Bulgaria acting as  a link.
                               O .However pro-German,  therefore,  the paper will never cease to hehypothetical!? pro-Russian.Dobrogea.     The Bulgarian authorities  are strengthening their hold onDobrogea.    It is announced that the railway Carol-Principe Nicolaeto Baba-Dagh has been inaugurated.   Bulgarian mayors and militaryadministration have  now been introduced everywhere in Old Dobrogea;everywhere Bulgarian schools have  been opened;  forty Bulgarianpriests are still wanted.   The  Kir,some days later, declares thatme of the greatest  aims of the present generation in Bulgariawill be to retain the whole of  Dobrogea within the BulgarianState, end this both for racial end  military reasons.  It gives asa partial justification for this extreme demand the terms of theRusso-Rumanian treaty published by Professor Vodovozov in the Dyen(Hay 14/27).Occupied Serbia,     The Bulgarian press is most indignant at the protests whichhave been made against the forcible  recruiting of the populationof occupied Serbia for the Bulgarian armies.  It declares that onlyMacedonians were recruited.   The statement is a curious one In viewof the orders which appeared a  few months ago In the Bulgarian presscalling up all the population in places like Prizren, Prishtinaand the Korava Valley between the  ages of 19 and 41.Administrative Changes.     Mr Zlatanov, Secretary-General  of the Ministry of the Interior,has been transferred to the same post to the Ministry of ForeignAffairs.  His successor will be Mr Arnaudov, hitherto Secretary tothe Council of Ministers.
Tsar Ferdinand&apos;s Visit to Berlin.     Sir W. Townley&apos;s conjecture as to the object of TsarFerdinand&apos;s visit to  Berlin.has aareadyHDeen^scuss^d in Reporton Serbia,  No.  3.  It is quite, possible, however, that thevisit is also largely due to  the change in the military situationbrought about by the  return of Mr Venizelos to power.                                            A.W.A.L.                                               3.7.17.
