SB Q B   T.  &apos;..  :        &apos;-&apos; .        &quot;  WAR CABINET.g.t.  1229.                    &apos; THE  ARAB  JiE&amp;IOH.                      SIR  MARK  SYEBS.      The inception of the scheme was as follows&apos;    -         .           After I had heen in Egypt ah out 10 days and had had anopportunity of studying tho situation in Cairo, I came to theconclusion that if (treat Britain and France wished to get fullmilitary and political value out of the Arab movement-, that itwould be necessary to get some organisation together which, wouldat once inspire the Arabs with a sense of unity and natioralexistence, and afford a rallying point for future secessions ofArabs to the Entente or Sherifian cense.           I discussed the matter very fully with General Claytonand M.Pioo-t, and then drew up the following memorandum which Ilaid before General Lynden-Bell, the Chief of the General Staff,and also showed the paper to Sir Reginald Wingate.      &quot;Aftor a general survey of the Arab situation in Egypt, I       have come to the concldsioh that it would be of consider-       able military-political value and of actual military value       if steps were taken to raise an Arab legion from prisoners       of War and Syrians in Bgypt. ,         (l) Prom a political point of view the organisation of             such a force would give work for idle hands to do,             promote Syrian and Arab unity, and stimulate             enthusiasm.         (2) Prom a military-political point of view it would             supply us with a rallying point for deserters of the             best typo, viz: deserters who come over through             conviction and not through cowardice.         (3) Prom a purely military point of view it v/ould put at             the authorities1 disposal a force capable of being             used at any point in the Hejaz, without in any way             breaking with our policy of not landing European             troops on sacred soil.           There aro of course many questions  of  detail as regardsstatus,  organisation,  command, etc to  be  considered,  and on thisoccasion I confine myself to  the question  as to whether the G.O.C-in-C.  would approve of the  idea which I  have the  honour to askyou will lay before him for his favourable consideration. &quot;      A conference was  then summoned at which  various  technicalpoints were discussed at which I,  as a purely  political  officer,was not present but General Clayton was on behalf  of the Arab Bureau.      Y/hile the matter  was  under  discussion  I  made my  first visitto Jeddah,  leaving on the 30th of April.   I discussed the ideaboth with Sherif Faisal and the King who both  considered that sucha force would be useful.   My  visit to He jag convinced me thatunless we sent an organised or coherent force  there  we should con-tmue to waste our assets as we have been  doing  in the nast.   The
-2-. general disorder which prevails in the Sherifian forces arises. from the fact that there- is no trained nucleus and that such contingents of volunteers as go to Hojaz get swallowed up in the general confusion.   The tribesmen come and go- waste ammunition, destroy rifles by neglect and devour the money and food we send.    The Sherifs, Faisal,  Ali, and Abdullah have no coherent.body on which they can rely, and the technical corps of gunners, engineers, and our own flying men have to work- practically without escorts. &quot;   *                           -.       On&apos;my return I found&apos; that.-the- idea of the legion had made considerable progress in Egypt,&apos;. the/questions of camps, equipment,  and method of training had been worked&apos; out by the&apos; military authorities.    I then approached. M,Picot once more on the  subject,  as most of.the prisoners who  would join the\ legion  would come from the French spheres, and as the logion; might have  to  operate  in any part of  the Arabic-speaking parts of Tarkey,, and as further OUT great object- is to prevent.the Arabs splitting Into  Preach and British partisans,&quot; T agreed that the initial raising of the legion should be under Anglo&apos;-French . auspices, but  that the.legion should  in the-field be independent; of joint control,  but  under the control of whatever high command&apos; was in  authority in the&apos;sphere in .which it operated,&apos;-.&apos;and that- no French or British officer should accompany, it in the field,. -.. and that tho executive Battalion authority should be in ;the- - hands of Arab  officers.    LLPicot informed me that-he could meet all charges out  of funds at his disposal,   This I laid verbally before  the O-in-C and Sir  Reginald. T/ingate.  &quot;-. \     - During my stay in Cairo I met&apos; Col.Jacob&quot;who informed me that Aden and  Cameran were good recruiting grounds for -skbh a-&apos;-.-. - force as the legion.&apos; ; . After discussion -with  the Chief&apos; of the&apos; General Staff  and General Clayton it-  was agreed that I. should&apos;-;.-. make investigations at Aden.with regard; to recruiting, there, .1 .-&apos; then regarded  the matter as practically sett-led-Captain- Bray and Lieut^Hankey were  appointed as  British ins true tors: and&apos;- M.Picot appointed a French officer, a lieutenant. .to - collaborate with them.  -   ...-&apos;.-,           - -       -    &apos; - -&apos;- v.&apos;- -    --.-&apos;&quot; &apos;      Propaganda was begun in&apos; the  camps and officers were. . -  . sounded as  to  their willingness to  join- -   I  left Egypt for&apos;  ..-jHejaz on-the 16th May,  and saw Sherif Faisal  at Wejh;   he-was. / accompanied by a Dr,Abdulla -to whom Colonel -Beachman took a &apos;. fancy.   Colonel Leachman proposed  that ho.and Abdulla should&apos; visit the prisoners of War camps in India  as  lie felt convinced that there  was good material there  if only it could be  properly approached.  *  I  accordingly sent the  following telegram to  the High Commissioner,  Egypt;-    :      &quot;Following for  Secretary of State  for -Foreign Affairs.  &quot;        Please  inform Secretary, of  State  for India.    After  -        conference  with Leachman and Faisal I  ascertained -&apos;        (1)  That  there  Is probably useful Arab material for .        recruitment  for Sherifs forces in  Prisoners  of War   , .        Camp in India.   (2)  That Hejaz forces  would welcome        such recruits.        In order  to  avoid difficulties experienced on previous  &apos;        occasions I suggest following  method of procedure.&apos;: That        Leachman accompanied, by two  Arab  officers  proceed to -the        Indian  camps and recruit..   If and  when recruits  have-      .  been enrolled Leachman hand  party over to  a selected - - .        British officer for transit  to Egypt where  men can be        trained for service.   Please ask  C-in-C India if  he  :        concurs in this procedure&quot;.   As - times  presses I  am -        taking  Leachman and two Arab&quot; officers  to  Aden, whence        they can proceed to India if 0*ln-.C approves..  I  expect        to reach Aden  2nd,- should  be glad if reply  could meet
        me there. .  Leachman is in any case, en route for ....&apos;&apos; &apos;      Mesopotamia and has to touch India.&quot;      On arriving at Aden I received the following from-G-in-C; India.-   -       :   -                  -&quot;&apos;-&apos;..:      ;     &apos;&quot; -  ,n-7e&apos; should he glad if Colonel Leachman and two Arab    :&apos; .. .-officers would come to. visit Prisoners of War camps         to enrol-recruits for service under She-rif as         suggested in telegram from Secretary of  State&quot;on which  I sent Abdulla to&quot;Bombay with Colonel Leachman.&apos;-Colonel.leachman asked for a guide to. recruiting so M.iicotand I gave him the following paper,.      : -  &quot;Objects. ..-,-&apos;-/&apos;-.-&apos;/;&apos;&apos;        (1) The Arab legion Lb being raised for tho purpose of            advancing the Arab cause and the liberation of            the Arabs, from Turkish dominion..      ;  (2) It is being raised under -Anglo-French auspices.

(v) Passports for Arab officers to be settled at.Aden.n      At Aden I also received the following telegram from themilitary  authorities in Egypt :-      &quot;For -Sir.Mark Sykes from Chief Egyptian Forces to Special -      Services London.   l.have approved formation.of an Arab      legion at the-suggestion&apos;of-Sir Mark Sykes and with the       concurrence of the.High Commissioner Cairo.  .1 am informed      by  Sir M, /Sykes.that the French are&apos;willing to bear half  ;       the expenses,. adjustment being effected in &quot;London.     - Meanwhile, will you please&apos; sanction provisional.expenditure :      for&apos;this purpose&quot; in &quot;order to make&apos;start. -Full details :    .:       follow by letter.&quot;    --            &quot; .  &apos;           .
and also the following from Captain Bray -      &quot;Proposed payment awaiting sanction of War Office.       Captain sixteen pounds, first  lieutenant thirteen       pounds,  second Lieutenant (?)  twelve pounds       per month,  free equipment and camp furniture.  Pay       of corporal sis: piastres per day, private three  -  : -&quot;       piastres per day.&quot; :.:      Taking these two in conjunction I assumed that thelegion was as good as settled&apos;and,  after a meeting with  -the Sultan of Lahej,  made arrangements to begin recruitingat Aden and Game-rain with the political officer, Aden. -      On arrival in Cairo I found that sanction had not yet &apos;arrived and that though everything was ready to begin workno moves could be  made, accordingly after consulting theCommander-in-Chief and the High Commissioner I sent thefollowing telegram .*-      &quot;Eope Arab Legion will be sanctioned without delay.-.&apos; :       Sources of recruitment are as follows Prisoner camps,&apos;-,       Egypt, Cameran Islands;  Aden; Arab residents, Egypt: .       Prisoners of War,-India;  prisoners of war-  Mesopotamia.      - Have good hopes of raising two- efficient battalions-&apos;  .       with adequate  drafts at depot by mid-September.,;; ...       However,  enthusiasm if aroused will give&apos; larger       numbers -as  number of men fit for service appealed ---&apos;-..       to. totals as . follows.. .-Egypt&apos; possible 3,COO; Aden .&apos;,       Cameran possible 6,000&apos;;   India Mesopotamia; possible 1,800.       Mesopotamia is sending 51 officers, 117 men.1  About . -       200 men and-21 officers waiting in Egypt.   I made arrange       ments in Aden and Cameran to begin recruiting.  Leachmaa       has gone to- India with specially selected Arab Officer&apos;       to work in  prisoner of war camps.    MoPicot has  concurred       in all steps  taken up to present,  and is providing  .       advisory officers in proportion to ours.   I submit.it       is too early to decide where or how Legion is to be -.       employed until competent military authorities have been       able to judge  of its military value and political       officers have  advised on situation obtaining when Legion       is fit for  service.    Members of Legion are  engaged.to       fight for Arab cause on Arab soil where they will serve       it best.    They will be  under the orders of -the  high       command in  the sphere selected for them .to  operate in.       Sherif and  Faisal have approved of Legion..  . At  present       small numbers  of Officers and men dribble into. Hejaz-/       and ore wasted owing to  natural disorganisation  which       obtains.    They either come  away disgusted  or  slip  into       apathy.  When the periodic  Rabegh panic occurs,  as I  &apos;-.;-&apos;       anticipate  it  may &quot;in October-Hovember,  everyone  will be       thankful for a fairly cohesive force whose presence in       Hejas will  not compromise the reputation.of  the  Holy.&apos;.-    -       Places.  If  the Legion is to be efficient its initial       organisation  and permanent depot should be formally       financed and  supplied by Egypt Force;   however,  if  and       when it,  or parts of it, are used in Hejaz or  elsewhere,       the finance may be  transferred if  convenient ;to  the . -       employing authority.   However,  it is to be  noted that      , half the  actual cost is  being defrayed by the  French  .-&apos;.:       on M.?icot&apos;s authority.    M.Picot  has done this  on  his .-v- .  own responsibility.   I beg,  therefore that matter be not       discussed with French as it  is  in  his  hands  and  he     .  understands his. own.people.     Trust sanction  will  not  &apos;-&apos;*.
        be delayed as  enthusiasm and success  depends  on an  .        early  visible  sign of Legion;   otherwise intrigues        and trouble will  mar inception of scheme.   High        Commissioner approves from a political point  of        view and C-in-C from point of view of organisation      -  and administration.&quot;       At Port Said.I  received the following  from Leachmanthe morning I  left Egypt.       &quot;On arrival Sound  Arab officers arc at Bellary t?/o-        days South and men, at Sumarpour despatch Hasan Sharif        to Bellary as  I am ill.

FOREIGN. OFFICE MIHITTB Oil TEE FOREGOING. THE ARAB LEGIOK.Sir Mark Sykes* Hote-      The origin of this proposal and the manner  in which...it was intended to carry it into execution were not adequatelyexplained to the&apos;&apos;Foreign Office in the  original telegramsreceived from - Sir &quot;R.-- &apos; Wing-ate..&apos;v                 -     &apos;&quot;  ed        &quot;--      &apos; &apos;   -&apos;.&apos;--&apos;.&apos;&apos;&apos;.&apos;-.&apos;..&apos; &apos; :&apos;  -      The oh sections form/, &quot;by&apos; the Foreign Office,  and   sharedby the India Office and. .B.M.I. to the project were based on  -.the idea -that the Force was to be a mixed one, trained and.officered by British and French instructors,&apos; that  half theactual&apos; cost was to be defrayed&apos; by - the French, and  that it  wasto be used exclusively in  the Hedjaz.  ...      The Foreign Office aid not see how French co-operationof this character could.be invited ,at -a moment when we.wereinsisting,.in spite of French remonstrances, on the closingof the Ottoman Bank at Jeddah, when we had asked, for the  ;.withdrawal of Colonel Brcmoncl and the -French military  mission,and when we were about to. address a note to the French Governmentdefining our preponderant position in Arabia.      Sir M. &apos;Sykes has explained that although the  Force isto be trained by British and French instructors, these willbo withdrawn as soon as the training is.over and the Legion  willproceed as a purely native, force under native leading  eitherto the A. and S, areas, or, if necessary, to the Hedjaz  for  itsdefence against Turkish attack.    He has further pointed outthat Monsieur  Picot will be able, to meet the French  share  ofthe expenses out of the funds at his disposal 8,3 French delegateon the Anglo-French Mission to Palestine and that thereforeno application need be made to&quot;the French Government forpecuniary or other assistance in the matter.      In view  of these explanations the Foreign Office isprepared to withdraw its objections to the &quot;proposal  for an  -Arab Legion and&apos;submits &quot;that&apos; it should be referred  to  theMesopotamia Committee .for decision..    . -                      .&apos;(Intd)   A.J.B.&apos;
