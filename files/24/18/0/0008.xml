Maolay to the Prime Minister)MINISTRY CP SHIPPING.   27th June, 1917. Dear Prime Minister,                    We had &quot;before us at the Meeting of the Shipping Control Committee this afternoon a statement by our Statistical Advisers on the effect of a continued los3 of 20 large ships per week.   This statement, illustrated by coloured charts, will, I hope, be ready for submission to the &quot;War Cabinet in a day or two, but there are one or two outstanding conclusions which I think I ought to put to you at once.     Over the past 3-J- months our losses have amounted on the average to 20 ocean-going ships a week,  and since the last outbreak of submarine activities they have been substantially above this figure.     Taking direct war requirements as they stand to-day, we are left with ships available for overseas imports numbering at the outside 1300.     In one year 20 ships lost per week would represent ...  do.                  do.                    tio4o m. do,         26       do.           do.       1300     do0         30       dft,       ,    do,       1660     Against this we must, of course,  set new tonnage, but until a decision has been come to in regard teethe extended programme for which we have been pressing, we are not justified in putting our total gains higher than  300 ships  in the next twelve months.     This is taking the most favourable view of our overseas pur- chases, a large proportion of which may be lost to us through the action of the American authorities.     The conclusion to which all this points is that by some means or other equilibrium must be brought about between losses and gains, and that with the least possible delay.     Our monthly rate of import  before the war was .  4,900,000 tons     The corresponding average for 1914/15 was . . .  4,200,000 tons     The corresponding average for 1916 was  ....  3*700,000 tons[            do.         do.   for first                          5 months of  1917 was . . .  2,900,000 tons                         *     At the best we have got to face a considerable further reduction.     To put the irreducible minimum at 1,900,000 tons per month would be taking a very low figure,  but we shall reach this figure, if losses continue at their present rate, in January or February next year, and even if we are able to  establish equilibrium by that ttate that will only enable us to maintain our imports at  that  level:
we shall not &quot;be able to increase them.     If that rate of import  prcves insufficient for the main-tenance of the civilian population,  or  if the process of bringingabout equilibrium is delayed,  there will  clearly be nothing forit but to cut down military  requirements.   So long as theoe aremaintained all losses,  of  course,  fall  on the ships carryingcommodities from overseas.     Since to balance a loos of  20 large  ships a week an annual -output of at least 4,500,000 gross tons,  at  home or abroad,would be required it is clear that at the best the task beforeus is a stupendous one.                        Yours very truly,                              (Signed)        MACLAY.     Of  course decreased loss from more  effective protection hasthe same effect  as  increased building, but the task is  so  stupen-dous that  it will call for all me can do  and at once, either byincreased  building, increased protection, or decreased  consumptionto accomplish it.(Intd.)   J.P.M.
