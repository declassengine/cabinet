War  Cabinet.iuestion  of flisonarge of the men from  the. Ar^ry^who are^aj located                  fr,r agricultural work, &amp;a.&apos;         Memorandum by Secretary of State for War.         I am afraid I can add but little to what I said on 2?th        the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 170(l)), with regard to thenecessity that ail men who may now be taken for agriculture shouldbe discharged,.   I have learned&apos;by experience that it is fareasier to give to agriculture than to lend, and that the lattercourse only gives rise to incessant friction between the twoDepartments.21         I would like the Cabinet to understand the difficultyof the position.   Under the very unpopular provisions of theMedical Re-examination Act we are taking back men who haveserved and been discharged,   They are of low category but wehave to tell them,  and it is the truth,  that they are urgentlyrequired to release men who can be more  actively employed.   Atthe same time as we are doing this,  we are sending away men fromthe ranks of precisely the same category to work on the land.What possible justification is there in  those circumstances forputting into force  the provisions of this unpopular Act?         There is the other side of the  question which I putforward, namely that we are, by means of the Agricultural workersand still more by means of the Transport Workers1 Battalions,giving rise to the  cry that we are getting industrial compulsionby a back door.   There is no ans?/er to  this charge, and althoughit was pointed out  at the Cabinet that the fact that they arebeing taken for agriculture to a certain extent disarms criMcism,the principle is the same, and is a principle that personally Icannot defend, and  I must ask, therefore, for authority to discharfrom the Army men who are lent for all purely civilian work; .-&apos;         If the decision of the War Cabinet stands, the WarOffice.is being forced into the impossible position ofconstraining men to do work in civil life which they are notready to do voluntarily, and that, to my mind,  is industrialcompulsion.       -  There is going to be great difficulty with the men whoare being sent to the land.   Ihese men  say,.with perfect truth,&quot;We are in the Army and are ready to serve in the Army, but we arecotton spinners, weavers, etc,, and if we are not to serve in theArmy we are going back to our own trades, and are not going towork on the land&quot;.    It would be impossible to punish a man whodeserts from a farmer;  the only thing to be done would be to callhim up again for military service, and then service in the Army ismade a form of punishment for a man because he refuses to dosomething w&apos;hich he  never undertook to do, and which - as long asthere is not general national service -  there is no right to makehim do.         The best proof of the  correctness  of what I  have statedabove is that the attention of  the  War Office has  been drawn tothe first Workmens*  and.Soldiers&apos;  Committee which  has been formed,and chief&apos;amongst the  grievances  that they  state must be remediedis this particular :form of industrial compulsion,
          I wish to press very strongly upon the Cabinet theneed there is to avoid making the Army appear to the publicto be an instrument of oppression.   There can be no doubt thatwhat is commonly called &quot;war weariness&quot; is in fact due to theinterference which war brings into the normal life of thepopulation.   The use of soldiers for civil work is the mostserious form of such interference, and I can imagine nothingmore certainly calculated to affect the morale of the working-class population, and to encourage the feeling that the war isbeing made a cloak to introduce a hidden form of industrialcompulsion.          If we are to win complete victory, it is necessaryfor us to do everything that can be done to maintain thespirit of our civilian population, and I would urge, mostearnestly upon the Cabinet that they should inimediately abandonthe policy which they are now pursuing, of making&apos;use&quot; &quot;of thepowers of the Army Act to compel civilians to work in occupationswhich they themselves have not selected.DERBY.5th July,  1917.
