SEC RET.--            WAR CABINET.G.T.1228              PURCEASES-BY THE EUROBEAH ALLIES II THE                 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.                      Report by Lord Curson                  (War Cabinet 159, Minute 4 ).          On the 7th June,&apos; the Minister  of Munitions  submitted to the War Cabinet a memorandum ( Paper G.T.966)  on  the  subject of E&apos; proposal outlined in  a cable from Mr.C.J.Phillips,  ono of the representatives of  the Ministry of Munitions In&apos;the U.S.A., for the establishment of an Inter-Allied Council to &amp;eal;with the purchases of the Ihiropoan Allies in the U.S.A.          The War Cabinet, on June the 8th, referred  the matter to me for my decision, and I summoned a meeting  of  the  repres- entfitives of the departments principally interested, viz. the Admiralty, Treasury, War Office, Ministry of Munitions  and Commission Internationale  de Ravitaillement.         &apos;As the result of this meeting a draft  proposal was prepared by Mr .Wintour,&apos; Sir E,Wyldbore Smith and Mr.Laytoh for the establishment of an Inter-Allied Council in  London,  cdhsist- ing of the principal representatives of the Allied Governments on the Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement, with the&apos; addition of American representatives,  and presided over  by a British Minister of Cabinet rank.          The functions of this Council were to  examine  the. requirements of the Allied Governments in the U.S.A.&apos; for  all olassos of material including food-stuffs,  ships, munitions.&apos; and raw material,  and- to submit them to the U.S.Government.          On discussion of this proposal it was  felt, that how- ever desirable might be the co-ordination thus intended.of all requirements and of all existing organisations concerned with them, it ?/ould be difficult in practice for one body to handle the Allied requirements for all classes of material.- The U.S.Government are: proposing separate organisations  to dealwith various Allied requirements such  as munitions, foodstuffs. and oil fuel,  and  it would be desirable that the organisations on this1 Side should correspond to those in the U.3.A.    Apart from this consideration,  the, determination of priority in satisfying requirements of say,  foodstuffs  and munitions is,amatter for each Government to  settle independently and couldnot bo attempted by a body:of the nature proposed.          The scheme appeared too elaborate and involved a considerable departure from the proposals of the U.8. Government as communicated in Mr.Phillips&apos;  cable of&quot;June 4th,besides introducing questions which were not within my competence to decide under my terms of reference from theWar Cabinet. &apos;
PI-2-    -  I accordingly Jugge&apos;at8d&quot;that in the;;e eircunmta:and having-regard to the evident- divergence of-views\which .existed between the various - Government Departments represented,- ; .the discussion should-he, adjourned-until such time : asamodified.and&apos; agreed proposal could be submitted to me;      On June . the .27th&apos;I &quot;held a further meeting,  at which a.&apos;.,-,revised scheme was; submitted contemplating the restriction of  .the scope of the proposed Inter-Allied Council to munitions  andraw materials involved in their manufacture.   A  copy  of thisdraft-scheme is annexed.  The , only difference of  opinion which,;still appeared to exist was with regard to the inclusion of - a  :&apos;clause descriptive of&apos;the&apos; functions of the Commission  Internation--ale de Ravitaillement,  in relation to the new body,              ;:      The&apos; view taken by the Ministry of Munitions was that the;.Inclusion of such a&apos;clause might be unacceptable to the French-Government,  but it appeared to me from the discussion which tookplace, that  any objection to co-operation with the CommissionInternationale- de&apos;Rayitaillenent was confined to one Departmentof the French Government,&apos;and need not be taken into seriousconsideration, while on the other hand the Treasury representativeattached considerable importance to the maintenance of theCommission&quot;Internationale de Ravitaillement as a means of controlover the operations of the Allies in so far as they were dependentupon-British creditsT&quot;   I accordingly agreed to the inDlusXohof the clause as&apos; it how shown (Clause..4) in the  annexed draft,and In&apos;this  conclusion the representatives of all the Depart-.ments concurred.       , .-    - -     It was  proposed to inform the Allied Governments..in trans- ;fflitting the draft scheme;to them, that the British Governmentv/ould be prepared, if the Allied Governments so desired, toappoint an - independent British Minister, I, e. a Minister not Incontrol of &quot;any particular;.Department, &quot; as Chairman of the Inter-.Allied&apos; Council,-&apos;.&apos; I quite agree as to the necessity of the Chair--man being -a-man of the highest&apos;possible ctan&amp;isg, and that Minis-serial rank is desirable, though perhaps not essential.  I haverecommended&quot;however, that this offer should net be communicatedto the Allies until it has been considered by the Far.; ahinet.and has received the approval of the Prime&quot;Minister.&apos;&apos;     I am of opinion that the  proposals as set forth in the  -annexed&apos;draft will materially assist the co-ordination of theAllies&apos;  purchases in the U.S.A and subject of course to suchemendations  as may be. suggested by the U.S. or other AlliedGovernments,  I recommend them for the sanction of the WarCabinet,     In order to avoid further delay I  have already arrangedthat the draft should be telegraphed to HoM.Ambassat.lor in&quot;t-ashington for communication to the American Government whoshould be asked to make its contents known to the Russian andItalian-Missions in the U.S.,    It has already been discussed informally with the French5 ?^ter 0f Munitiona and 1      also arranged for Sir Edmundwyidbore Smith to communicate the sense of the proposals infor-mally to General Hermonius and Baron Mayor des Planches, thewussian and Italian delegates respectively on the CommissionihieJ?  ionale deRavi^-illement,  Weight, therefore, very      y.   -and ourselves in a position to proceed. -------T                             &apos;(Intd)  C. of K.June 50th 1917.                     .
