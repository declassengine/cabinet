   CopyS B -C R 1 g  G.T. 1258                   WAR CABIHET .letter from Brigadier General C Ballard, C.B.,Military Attache, Roumania.                                           JA8SY,                                              June  8th,  191.7. Dear Buckley,      As  Thomson will he home  before you get this  he  will have told you all  about this place at  length. 1.    Certain things are not nearly so baa as  I had pictured them.   The railways have got  some sort  of system  - de  Candolle has been  doing great work and  is sure  to do  more,  for he  gets on very well with  the Russians and the local crowd.   And the questions of famine and sickness are not so  bad as they were. 1 have seen very little of the Roumanian Army yet, -but  have had talks with Berthelot and he says they are qudte good  troops now; he takes  a good deal of credit to himself for  the  improvement, but also  admits that he was surprised how quickly  they  have recovered and how  quickly they learnt.    1 am very sorry he is going - he is just the cheery sort of fellow who can  strike the right note with these Roumanians and at  the  same time he standsno nonsense from them. 2,    So far so good - other things very bad.   The decisive factor will be the morale of the Russian Army, and unless it improves  the Russians will declare an armistice before long, for no Government would dare to prosecute the war vigorously. Sir G.Barclay thinks I am pessimistic about this,  and I only hophe is right.   Barratt and ?/alford are on very intimate termswith the Russian H.Q. Mess and, though the senior  officers donot let themselves go,  they often get youngsters  in a confidential,  not to say maudlin,  mood in which they let out a lot of very bad stories about the  troops.   I have also  had officers here at the Mission asking if they can be transferredto&quot; the British Army;  the  answer is obvious - if all the keen
                          .* - officers leave the front the situation there will he worse than ever.   But I let them talk, firstly because it assists my education in Russian,  and also because they are quite ready to tell me all about their Regiments and  what the officers and men are saying.   And my impression is that at present they are drifting towards an armistice.    The  only chance is that as they are very impressionable people something may turn up to set the tide the other way.   But we are fools if we fail to be prepared for the worst,  and I hope  you will see that this view is put in front of the wry highest  quarters;  if it turns out to be all wrong I must take the blame as an alarmist. We are doing what we can,  but  our efforts can only be a dropin the ocean.(Sgd.)  C.  BALLARD*
