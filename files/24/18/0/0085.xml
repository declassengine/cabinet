(Repeated to Aden.)                    (Received at India Office, 8 p.m.)   Secret.   Hodeida.  Reference to  Naval Oommander-in-Chief s telegram153 of 1st July to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.   We desire to protest emphatically  against the bombardment of Hodeidawithout our being previously  consulted.  Apart from the deplorable positionin which this action leaves the British subjects in Hodeida, we feel seriousmisgivings as to its effect on Aden Hinterland generally, and in particular onImam who, as we know, is extremely sensitive regarding Hodeida.   We trustthat instructions may be issued  to  Admiral invariably to consult us beforeundertaking operations of this kind in areas under our political control.  -
