Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.BYJP/008.        (5th July, 1917.)\7eekly Report on Poland.  VIIIi     Polish politics  seem to have  relapsed into the old rut ofslow negotiations  and petty party  struggles and intrigues.    Pourweeks have passed  since  the Central Powers have given theirlong-expected and  long-deferred answer;  within very few daysof its receipt the majority of the Council of State decided toaccept it  as basis for further action and yet nothing seems tohave happened since.   The Left continue to announce theirimpending  withdrawal;  the conservatives  represented in the  Councilof State and the aristocratic branch of  the late pro-Russianconservatives seem meantime to be  drawing together.   The NpwaRef/orma, which is  well informed whenever it is not intentionallymisleading, alleges in its issue of June 24 that Count AdamTarnowski, the late Austro-Hungarian ambassador at Sofia andWashington, is the most  serious candidate for the Polish Premier-                      i/rship; that his candidate is supported by Prince Z* Lubomirski;that Prince Z. Lubomirski himself aims at becoming Crown Marshalof the reconstructed Council of State; and that the Left runsPilsudski  as candidate for the Premiership.   The intransigeantsfrom among the National Democrats seem still to entertain a hopeof drawing Prince  Lubomirski away from his new associates andprobably with this purpose in visw they  manoeuvre to get him togo to Switzerland  (if the interpretation put by us on a certainnewspaper  article  is correct).    -Yet even should they succeed, it is     clear whether  thewithdrawal, of Prince Lubomirski at this  time -would give a better
turn to the present development of Polish politics.    It mightmerely further the process of decomposition in the Council of State-a hody which after all has for the last half year fought againstthe Central Powers for the government and administration of Poland;and there is all the difference in the world between slow  de-composition and the Council1 s resigning in a body as had beenproposed by Pilsudski on Mayl.   Possibly a successful Russianoffensive,  by disturbing the  feeling of security which the Germansrecently seem to have enjoyed in Poland,  may help Polish politicsout of the  hopeless condition into which they have drifted by thelack of decision and courage  on the part  of the &quot;moderate&quot; andconservative elements in the  country.     We have received from a  reliable source the following in-formation concerning Pilsudski&apos;3 attempts to prevent the CentralPowers from dallying with the Poles and delaying their decisionany longer.   Having failed on May 1 to persuade the conservativesin the Council to undertake strong action with regard to theCentral Powers he turned to the late pro-Russian aristocrats.&quot;II me faut une epe*e&quot; was Talleyrand*s summing-up of the positionin 1799; Pilsudski had to find a figure-head - a name with anhistoric title.   May 3 is a  great Polish national day andcorresponds in importance to  the American Fourth of July.   Pilsudskioffered to  Prince &amp;. Lubomirski, after all a much overratednonentity,  to mobilise on that day his military organisation,which in Warsaw alone is a few thousand men strong,  and to proclaimafter the service in the Cathedral, Prince Lubomirski Regent ofPoland.   Lubomirski answered by asking whether Pilsudski would beable to arrest the German Governor-General, von Beseler,  and onreceiving the obvious answer  in the negative is reported to havesaid: &quot;In that case Beseler will arrest us&quot; - and refused toentertain the proposal.   it  is clear that the proposed coup d&apos;etat
would have led to the arrest of Pilsudski and Lub emir ski andprobably also to their exclusion from Polish public life as longas the Germans retain a footing in Poland.    But it is equallycertain that it would have forced the Germans into decisive actionneither they nor the Polish Council of State could have  continuedlong-drawn negotiations over matters of secondary importanceafter a coup dl It at in which the two most prominent individualsin Warsaw would have been concerned.    The Germans would havehad either to create a real Polish government,  of course not outof revolutionaries of the Pilsudski type or any of his associates,or they would have had to scrap their policy of so-called &quot;con-ciliation&quot; in Poland.     The moment of crisis and supreme political tension washowever allowed to pass by.   &quot;Owing to a misplaced policy of&quot;conciliation&quot; the Council of State and its new allies have giventheir own policy another lease of life and to the Germans thedelay which they need.LBN,
