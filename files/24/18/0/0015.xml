With the exception of the submarine attack on trade, there have been no operations ofimportance during the week.                        Submarine Attack on Trade.    THE following table compares the tonnage and  number of British, Allied, andneutral ships entering or clearing to and from the United Kingdom, with the number andtonnage of ships sunk by submarine or mine whilst on passage to or from the UnitedKingdom during the same period.  All coastal, Channel, and Dutch trade is eliminated.Commissioned vessels and  troopships are not included.   Under the heading &quot; OtherVoyages &quot; are included  those ships sunk on other oversea voyages than to or from IheUnited Kingdom.

     Although the losses showa decrease on the last weekly return, they are still heavyand considerably in excess of ,the average weekly loss incurred in May.  They weredistributed  as follows :  South  and  West  of  Ireland, 13; Channel, 5;  North andWest of Scotland, 4;  Bay  of  Biscay,  4; North Sea, 1; and Mediterranean, 1.   Thetransport &quot; Cestrian &quot;  was also  sunk in the Eastern Mediterranean on the 25th June.Owing to the heavy losses to the South and West of Ireland, incoming trade was as faras  possible diverted on the 21st June in the direction of the Scilly islands and roundthe North of Ireland.     A total of thirty submarines are  believed to have been operating in the variousareas on the  24th June, sixteen of these being small boats  in the North  Sea andChannel.   Thirty reports of encounters with enemy submarines were received duringthe week, and  it is probable that successful results were obtained in three cases.     Out of nineteen large ships sunk in the vicinity of the United Kingdom, thirteenwere homeward bound, and in the previous week out of twenty-three ships seventeenwere homeward bound.  It was pointed out in Weekly Appreciation No. 1 that theproportion of inward ships sunk  was usually higher than this, due to the better controlit was possible to exercise over the outward sailings.  The smaller proportion of inwardships now sunk  is probably due to the. better control which the convoy  system isbeginning to bring into force.     The Atlantic convoy which sailed  from  the U.S.A. on the 4th June arrived safelyon the 20th.   The only item of interest was the  diversion of the  Liverpool section froma dangerous area on parting company with the remainder of the convoy.  Three oceanconvoys  totalling thirty-eight  ships and 253,001) tons have  thus been broxight in sincethe  2l)th  May without  losing a  ship.  The  third  Atlantic  convoy which sailed  fromHampton Roads  on the  12th  June ran into a fog the day after sailing.  Some of theships- were rather scattered in consequence, but were again in company by the  15th.&quot;A convoy from the U.S.A. should now arrive every week and after the 20th July everyfour days.     A further report-has been received of the attack of  five  torpedo-carrying seaplaneson shipping in the vicinity of Harwich  on the 14th June.   Five  torpedoes were firedat the steamships &quot; Kankaku,&quot; &quot; Canto,&quot; and  &quot; Antonius  &quot; ; all missed except one,which sunk the first-named ship.  The  &quot; Antonius &quot; was also attacked with bombs andmachine-gun fire, but was not damaged.  This is the second  ship the  enemy havesucceeded in sinking by this method within the  last few months.     The declaration that the Germans intended  to sink all ships on sight within acertain area came into force on the 1st February, and it is of interest to note its effecton the submarine campaign during the  last five  months.  In 1915 and 1916 the enemysubmarines generally attacked on the surface, bringing ships to by gun fire or signaland then sinking  them  by torpedo or bombs.   They thus utilised their superior surfacespeed and were able to overhaul the ordinary  cargo ship from  every direction.  Themore general  arming of merchant ships towards the end of  1916, combined  withincreased risks from decoy ships, tended to drive the submarine  below the surface, andthis was finally expressed  in the foregoing declaration.   The result is shown by thefollowing figures.  Out of the total ships sunk in 1915  and  1916 only 21  and 29 percent, respectively were sunk without warning. During the months of February, March,April, and May of 1917  the percentage rose to 64 per cent.   Thus the  arming ofmerchant ships, by increusing the number of totally submerged  attacks, has made thework of the submarine more difficult and has tended to limit its  cruising period to thenumber of its torpedoes.  Other things being equal,  one  would have expected thenumber of sinkings to decrease, owing  to the greater difficulties  of submerged attack,but  that factor has been more  than discounted by the increasing number of enemysubmarines and the decreased risk from gun fire.  The final  result is, the  sinkingshave considerably increased since the German declaration of February.                       SUMMARY OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.                      Movements of German Merchant Ships.    To and from Norwegian ports : Arrived, 3.  Sailed, 7.    To and  from Rotterdam :  Arrived, 12.  Sailed, 5..  26 German  ships  in theharbour on the 22nd June.    The German steamship  &quot; Venus &quot; struck  a mine and sank 15 miles west of themouth of the Ems.
                  Telegram from the Naval Attache at The Hague.    There appears to be no record of any German steamer arriving at Rotterdam inballast by inland waterways.  Coal arrives by Rhine barges,  and is transshipped intoGerman ships, which proceed to German ports and from  thence  to Scandinavian oreports, returning from them with ore to German ports,  and again to Rotterdam inballast for  more coal.   Others proceed  direct to Scandinavian  ports  with  coal,returning to German ports with ore.WEEKLY INTELLIGENCE  REPORT,. JUNE 26,  1917.                                    Russia.    Baltic. German air raids are reported on Russian air  stations  on the Island: ofOsel and against the W/T station at Runo, in the Gulf of Riga.  The  W/T station hasapparently been destroyed, but the other raids caused insignificant damage.    Our submarines are believed to be operating in the Baltic.  There is no news ofany  operation by the Russian fleet.   Admiral Vederevski  has  succeeded AdmiralMaximov as  Commander-in-chief, the latter superseding Admiral Roussine as NavalAdviser at Army  Headquarters.   Kronstadt  has not yet sent its submission to  theProvisional Government.    Black Sea. There has been further  trouble at Sevastopol  as a result  of  a  visit ofsailor delegates from the Baltic and Kronstadt.  The Provisional Government  showedfirmness in dealing with the question, and it is believed that conditions are now lessserious.                               AIR INTELLIGENCE.1.  General Information.    (a.) A report has been received  stating that on the 25th May ten twin-enginedseaplanes were housed  in the  southernmost shed on the Mole  at Zeebrugge.  It isprobable that these are  of the &quot; Brandenburg &quot; torpedo-carrying type.    (b.) It is learned  from the prisoner brought down on the 5th June that  themachines that raided Sheerness flew  over the North Sea at 13,540 feet  and  crossed  theEnglish coast at  15,420 feet.    (c.) German Rigid  Airships.          Number known to have been destroyed since the war,&apos; 21.          Number reported to have been destroyed since the war, 33.  1          Approximate number of naval airships in existence, 19.          Approximate number of military airships in existence, 20.Naval Staff,    June 27, 1917.
