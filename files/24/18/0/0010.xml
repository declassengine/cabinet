&apos;S82SBLL*Intelligence. Bureau,.Department of in^tarmataxEuB.5.IffiEORAOTJKTHE  EMPEROR  CHARLES.June 18th.This letter is the result of several conversations with agentleman in high position who has an intimate knowledge of the  jj     At the death of Francis Joseph the oharacter and the politicalindividuality of the Archduke Charles were, even to the Courtcircles, absolutely unknown.   He was known as an amiable youngman v/ho took great interest in military matters, who was fond of    sit up&quot; with them late  in the Austrian way  of gay  conviviality.    In    his free hours he received high  officials  of both the Vienna and &quot;    Budapest GoTemxjment, who delivered  lectures  to  him on various    political and economic  subjects.    The Archduke!s teachers  and  his    jailitary comp*anions noticed, as  a prominent  feature of  Charles&apos;s    character, his keen sense of independence  and a certain obstinacy ,    Which is the common inheritance  of  the Kabsburgs.    But they said    also  that, contrary to  the Habsburg tradition,  tho young Archduke    Was very loyal to his  friends, charmingly  simple  in his ways and of    an impulsive outspokenness as to things he considered right  or  wrong.%   As an Archduke he made  a point of strictly avoiding any political    subjects or of showing  any predilection,, or  prejudice,  for  or    against any one of the  varicusi A^Stro-Hungarian nationalities&apos;.    Only    at the beginning of the war, at  the time of  the desertions  en masse    of Czech regiments, the then Archduke was  heard to spedk bitterlypersonality of the youngsBiBperbr-King.the company of his brother^offleers and who Was not disinclined to
of the Czechs;  he seems never to have forgiven them their attitude.     His military companions were always encouraged to speak-freely to the Archduke.   He liked unrestrained fellowship as longas it was advised by tact, and very often joined in good-humouredjokes about the manners of Prussian officers j and though thePrussian officers he came in contact with as often as not jarredon his nerves,  he never made a secret of his admiration of theeffioient organisation of the Prussian army.   He never spokeabout the Emperor William; but his intimates had the impressionthat the young Archduke resented the Emperor!s overpoweringinfluence r/ith Francis Joseph.   In this respect there is only onecharacteristic occurrence known.   It happened at Francis Joseph&apos;sdeath, when Emperor William, hastening to &quot;Vienna, tried to disturbthe young Emperorfs first hours of grief by inviting him to discusspolitical affairs.   It is maintained on good authority thatCharles I&apos;s indignant answer occasioned the German Emperor to leaveVienna without attending the funeral.   Since then the personalrelations of the two Emperors have been politely correct aMformal.     The first indications of the young Emperor&apos;s politicalindividuality became noticeable through his reconstruction of theImperial Household.   The names of Count Berchthold, PrincesLobkowitz and Hohenlohe disclosed the Emperor&apos;s desire to breakwith the traditions of the era of Francis Joseph  and to ventureupon a new departure.   The appointments of Counts Clam-Mart in icand Czernin were erroneously commented upon as indicating agreater consideration for Slav grievances, for which reason thosefirst acts of the new Sovereign made a very bad impression inHungary as well as in Berlin.   As a matter of fact the Emperor-King was prompted by quite different reasons.    First of all hewished to be surrounded by quite new people of no political past,
who would &quot;be more pliable to his wishes and would not continuallyrefer to traditions which. Charles I had decided to abandon.   Thusthese appointments were, psychologically, the outcome of theEmperor&apos;s strong sense of independence :uid, politically, the-were inspired by the basic principles of the programme which theEmperor had resolved upon following.     Since then, the Emperor^ Speech from the Throne and theAustrian Prime Minister^ declaration in parliament have, in ageneral way. defined those principles.   The Emperor intends i;omaintain tt?,e dual form of the Monarchy and,    regards Austria, tomake the Austrian idea &quot;combine the various nationalities&quot;.   Theprinciple is not a new one.   It means centrn.lis.tion as opposedto federalism and thus the negation of the claims of the variousnon-German nationalities.   In pr ctice it will mean the transferof the executive powers of the provincial Diets to Vienna.    \Jhatare the Emperor!s objections to federalism?   First of all thefierce opposition of the (Austrian) Germans and Magyars to anyanti-dualistie scheme; for federalism means an even readjustmentOf political power to the detriment of the present German hegemonyin Austria on.* of Magyar supremacy in Hungary.   Secondly,  theapprehension that a far-reaching autonomy of the various provincesmight strengthen the desire of a complete union with the co-nationals beyond the frontiers and thus,ultimately,lead to abreak-up of the Empire.   Thirdly, there are considerations ofinternational policy.   The Emperor is persuaded that,  given anequal political influence of the various nationalities,  theinternational policy would have to vacillate so as to satisfyevery individual nationality.   The Germans and Magyars would claimthe maintenance of the Alliance with Germany;  the Slavs wouldoppose it and vote for an alliance with Russia.    For similarreasons the Monarchy would be prevented from directing  her  policytoward^ the West.
        Those are  the Emperor&apos;s views  which,  of oourse,  are mostly   &quot;based upon fallacies.    The very  geographical position of Austria-   Hungary makes it  imperative for her to  live  in the best of friend-   ships v/ith both of her  great neighbours without binding herself   to any one - a  policy which would perfectly  satisfy both the   Germans and the Slavs.    Again, if  friendly  relations on equal   terms were maintained with her small neighbours in the Hear East.   there might be  no apprehension of disrupting propaganda and pro-   vooation.        V/ith regard to  Hungary the  riperor-King seems to have correctly   recognised the  fact  that the perpetual  strife between Tisza and   Andrassy - both namee only ae a symbol  of  two cliques alternately   aspiring to satisfy  their personal  ambitions - could  only be   alimiaated&quot;from:Hungarian public  life by the infftsion of a hew   political  power -rthe people.   As in Austria,  he started the   experiment by trusting  the administration  to new personalities.   Count EBzterhazy will not be averse to  a readjustment which will   more evenly distribute  political  power  between Hungary and Austria   and he will certainly leave Count Czernin  a  free hand as regards   the international policy of the Monarchy.    Count Tiaza,  however,   who in Parliament commands an overwhelming majority,  is still  a   great power to  be reckoned with.    Though  Count Eszterhazy has   clearly stated  that  his extension of franchise would  not  affect   the hegemony of the  Magyars it remains  to  be seen if  Count Tisza   will not use his influence with the Counties anil start a propaganda   which would compel the  Government to dissolve Parliament  and proceed   to new elections with a ver;y doubtful prospect.        In Austria the  young Emperor!s policy has obviously  failed and   in Hungary the  chances  are not very hopeful.    So far it  is a  chaos   in both halves  of the tlonarchy, and the only people whom he has   succeeded  in staisfying are the Germans of  Austria.    True, there
is an exulting tone in the press of Budapest and the Socialistsin Hungary seem to have chosen the King&apos;s party.   But thie - isnot the feeling of Hungary.   The Magyars are tiissatisfied &quot;becausethey resent the way Tisza has been dropped cad because theyimagine that Hungarian affairs are being settled in Vienna; and thenationalities fca Hungary could not well be expected to welcomean extension of franchise which, confessedly, leaves them out inthe cold.   Again, even Count Karolyi1s group has a now grievance:^&quot;heirO.-eader*having-1&amp;een -called to join the Eszterhazy Cabinet andconsenting was, two days later, informed that the Y/ilhelmstrassehad objected to his appointment on the ground that Count Karolyi&apos;sforming part of the Cabinet &quot;would give rise to misunderstandingabroad&quot;.     Serious students of Austro-Kung^rion affairs will, out of thepresent chaos,  first note the fact that in both, halves of theMonarchy there are Governments ?.&apos;ith practically no Parliamentaryfollowing, that both in Austria nnd in Hungary measures are beingproposed which by the majority of the population axe rejected.    Thelogical consequence of this state of affairs is either therelinquishing of his programmes by the Emperor-King (which givenhie psychological qualities is not likely) or some coup d&apos;etat  underthe protection of Martial Law.   This seems to be the directionthings are taking and it is, perhaps, with a view to such possibleemergencies that the Emperor-King tried to and,  both in Vienna  andBudapest, succeeded in getting control of the Socialist influence.     The Emperor-King^ ideas on international policjt are,  as yet,not clearly defined.    He is ambitious and desires an independentpart.   Yet his policy abroad will always depend upon the domesticsituation.   Personally, he will, no doubt,  try to free theMonarchy from German tutelage without,  however,  thinking of givingup the Alliance.   Charles I&apos;s fundamental idea seems to be to
                            m  Q mform a strong bond between  Austria-Hungary,  Bulgaria an:&quot;  Turkeyand to make this combination the counterbalance  of  Germaninfluence within the Quadruple-Alliance.   The plan is  certainlyambitious but given the  desperate  financial  dependence  of thesethree parties it is difficult  to see hw?  it  can  be  realised.
