THE BUTCH SITUATION...                                         July 4th* 1917     In connection with the Foreign Office MemorandumOn the Dutch situation, of June 18th- and the telegramsfrom Holland, 1950 and 1951, 1 venture to think  thatthe Dutch situation requires the  close attention ofthe War Cabinet..  As the Cabinet  knows, the Dutch have.exported since the&apos; beginning of the War, very largequantities of foodstuffs to Germany.  Until theRiddle of 1916, roughly speaking  they were exporting;to Germany the whole of the  surplus production beyond&apos;what was -required for their mm people.  In order - tolimit that, we entered into certain agreements with theDutch agriculturists, the brood effect of - which  was to&quot;divide the Bat oh exports between  Germany and ourselves,-in e ome thing like t he pre-war proportions.  Re cent1y,owing presumably to the increasing want of provisionsin Germany, the German Government have been pressingthe Dutch to increase their exports to Germany - inparticular they are asking for potatoes.  The positionon that matter is that under the  agreements the  Dutchowe us some 13,000 tons of potatoes, and we are  urgingthat they have no right to export potatoes to Germanyuntil they have paid off their potato debt to ourselvesApparently, in spite of these representations, an appro-Oiable quantity of potatoes is going into Germany.
Then,  there is? the question of cattle.  Owing to: thecomparative failure of the fodder crops in Holland,to!  the difficulties of importing fodder from overseasthe  Dutch are threatening to export a large  quantityof their surplus cattle to Germany.  On the otherhands  we have been urging the United States not tolicense the export to Holland of any foodstuffs orfodder, unless the Dutch will abandon their exports toGermany, and it seems likely that the United StatesGovernment, sooner or later, will carry out thispolicy.  The Germans may, and probably will, replyby threatening to cut off coal and shipbuildingmaterials and potash and dyes for all of which articlesthe  Butch are absolutely dependent on importe-fromGermany.     Besides all this, we have&apos; had&apos; a number of ,small&quot;controversies with the Dutch, in $hich we have accusedthem of showing undue partiality to Germany, particu-larly  in allowing war material, in the ahupe of gravelfor  concrete entrenchments, to-be carried over Dutchcanals from Germany to the Western Front.&apos;     On the top of all thie comes the declarationof the new danger zone in the Bortb Sea, which theDutch  say cuts them altogether off from communicationwith the out;-ide world.     - In spite of all this, I am disposed to. proceedwith the- policy as laid down, and, to encourage theftalteti States to put the utmost pressure on the Dutchto cut off their trading with Germany,  recognising
 that later on  it may be  necessary to  allow them to  export a  . certain  amount to  Germany,  though I hope much less  than they are exporting  at th&amp; present  time. But  the War Cabinet  ought- to  he aware that this policy  involves a certain aaacmnt  of risk. It  isj just possible  that the  Butch might be so provoked by it that they  weuld throw themselves  into the  arms of Germany end allow her  to occupy  the  Dutch coast.  I  think this extremely unlikely.  It is more possible, that the  Dutch will submit to Allied pressure and  that the  Germans  will  thereupon reply by imposing,  in the first place,  the utmost economic pressure,and if  that  fails,as it  probably  would, it  is  conceivable that they might declare  war  on Holland.  I dc not  myself think that this is at  nil probablej all the signs arc that the Germans arc very anxious  to conciliate Dutch opinion,  and have even  gone so far as  to offer then compensation for the 7 Dutch ships they, sunk in  the Channel in  february.       But it  must be recognised  that If the full American policy is  carried out, &amp;nd  the  Germans reply by economic pressure on their side, a  very serious state  of things  will  be created in Holland, ?md we  must  certainly  be prepared, for considerable disturbances there, and &amp; great- deal  of indignation  with us.  In return for that we may hope,  if the policy  succeeds,  to  diminish German supplies to the extent shewn in  the  annexed table.       Finally,it  must not  be forgotten that we are dependent on  Holland for a large part of our margarine.       If  the  War  Cabinet approve generally of  the  policy of pros euro on -Holland,  I think  they must  be  prepared  to spend,  if necessary,  considerable  additional sums in buying Dutch produce, otherwise,  whatever  agreements are made with the Dutch  Authorities the Dutch  farmers  will undoubtedly, in  one way  or another,export everything they can  to Germany.

Increasing of danger area of seas in immediate contiguityto Butch coasts hag created widespread feeling of irritationwhich is of course being made most of  by our adversaries.Mr. Van Aalst came to me In state oi great agitation thismorning on the subject and said he had decided to resignChairmanship of Trust.

It appeared alsoas an ungracious answer to shipping proposals just submitted.     I was unable-&apos;to explain situation as I am without anyofficial information on the subject, a fact about which VanAalst presumed to twit me in his wrath,  I saw Minister forForeign Affairs later.  He seemed to bo somewhat reassuredbg message he had received from Netherlands Minister in London.I would venture to submit that some modification&apos; should bemade unless military reasons make any change impossible.
