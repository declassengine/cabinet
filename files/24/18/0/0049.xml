June .50th 1917 Internal polities        The inner history of the recent Cabinet crisis  is  still somewhat obscure.   As far as we can gather, its  general outline is as follows:-        The Interventionist Coalition has for some time past  been carrying on a campaign, against various alleged weaknesses  in  the Government - in particular against the Ministry of the  Interior as being too conciliatory and inclined, to compromise in its treat- ment of Neutralists - Socialist or Oiolittian, and against the de- fective organisation of the technical departments.   It would seem that the whole coalition had planned to bring about a crisis  after the re-assembly of -Parliament, perhaps also to organise v/ith  that object popular demonstrations on the pattern of those v/hich took place in May 1915.   Of this course the Democratic wing of the Interventionists seem o.t the last moment to have fought shy - fear- ing chiefly that a crisis in Parliament might reinforce instead of weakening the Ciolittian element in the Government.   This was the more to be feared as a rapprochement seems to have been taking place between Giolittian deputies and the Interventionist coalition. There has been much talk cpiite recently ofa movement to replace Boselli by Orlando,  and this,  or less probably a return of Salandra to power at the head of a small and energetic T/ar-Cabinet (whichappears to be desired by the Nationalists),  might  have  been the re- sult of a defeat of the  Government  in the  Chamber.   Neither resultwould have been acceptable  to  the Democratic section of Interven-
                                                              99 i)                                                              hJ *W Utionists.   They accordingly took advantage of the Proclamation ofAlbanian Independence to bring on a partial  crisis before Parliamentmet.  Their dislike of Sonnino&apos;s methods is  no doubt genuine enough,but the attack was not meant to be pressed home.  It was merely toserve as a pretext for a limited crisis which while not upsetting the&quot;National  Ministry&quot; should secure certain changes which were reallydesired.  The change in the Ministries of i-ar and Marine seems toha ve been demanded by Bissolati - the former, it is said, at theinstance of Cadorna.          For the mtment the manoeuvre adopted by the Left seemsto have succeeded, but the movement for a general crisis has ob-viously not been dropped;  and the enthusiastic reception given toOrlando&apos;s  speech in secret session and the fact that prominenceis given to this &quot;very great success&quot; in the Nationalist organseems to point to a parliamentary coalition  of some sort betweenGiolittians and Nationalists.  It may be that one reason whyboth supported the proposal for a Secret Session was that it pro-vided a convenient cover for this manoeuvre.  Orlando appears inhis speech and in recent Conferences to have made it clear that hepersonally was and had been quite ready to pursue a vigorous policyagainst Neutralists.  The restraining influence seems to have beenexercised by Bcselli.     Meanwhile the Democrats seem to be dividedas to their attitude towards a general crisis.  No definite line ofaction seems to have been decided upon at the Meetings held beforethe opening of Parliament by the Radical and Republican groups.On the other hand the Reformist Socialist Party and the Party ofNational Action have declared in favour of a general crisis, andthe Official Socialists may be counted on to vote against theGovernment.     The reception given to Sonnino!s speech on the 20th both in theChamber and in the Press seems to make it certain that his positionis secure.
International Relations.     A difficult position is teing--^Government over the question of a revision of war-aims and ^^itgreeme-rrt-sThe proposal of the Russian Government and its acceptance by GreatBritain calls forth excited and indignant protests in Nationalistand other imperialistically-minded quarters. - &quot;Ridiculous toattempt to reason with a 1000-headed and epileptic monster....&quot;&quot;to accept a Conference is to commit suicide..&quot;  &quot;impertinentdoctrinairism of the 1 Soviet *&quot; ....  &quot;Where shall we find anincentive for continuing the V.ar if we are to rencunce alladvantages..&quot;  Such are specimens of the language used.  It is askedtoo (with an obvious tu quoque reference) &quot;whether Great Britainv^ras authorised beforehand to speak in the name of the Allies&quot;.And hopes are expressed that the Minister for Foreign Affairs willrefuse to be drawn into a Conference, and will take active steps todissuade the Allies from, such a course.     These are perhaps the utterances of extremists - the quo-tations are from the Idea Nazionale and the Mattino of Naples;  butthere can be little doubt that the raising of the question, if itis done publicly, will raise a storm in Italy, the centre of whichwill be the claim to the Dalmatian mainland.  On this question itcannot tm&quot; doubted by anyone who has closely studied the ItalianPress during the War that the great majority of Italian opinion is^Eroior less on the side of the Nationalists who are foremost in urgingthis claim.  Until quite recently only a voice here and there hadbeen raised in favour of the Slavs/ and it is only during the lastfew months that any real opposition has been offered to theNationalist contentions.     Popular feeling has always included Dalmatia among the&quot;Torre irredente&quot; and regards it as being historically andculturally an outlying province of Italy,  from which $er influence
30.6.17.has been ousted by--Aus1^an maohija^^of the Croats and the Catholic Church.   This feeling the Nationalistparty has recently been  busy in fostering,  end Democrats have re-frained from pronounced  opposition,  partly from fear of destroyingthe &quot;Union Sacree&quot;,  partly out of  a  tdnder feeling, general inItaly, for the Nationalist Party to  which it is felt that the countryowes gratitude for the undoubted service it has done in buildingup national unity and self-confidence.   And it is the hope ofcompleting this process,  so often  thwarted by internationaljealousies in the past, which more than anything else brought Italyinto the  war and inspires her to pdrsevere  in it.                                            *T c C .
