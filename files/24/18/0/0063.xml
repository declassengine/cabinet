RELEASE (S MEN FOR MILITARY         --SERVICE.i-     I dosire to bring to attention of  the rar Cabinet the attached letter from the lontroller of Timber Supplies, in order that it may he considered in connexion with theMemoranda already he fore the War CabinetIn the  subject of recruiting.                     A.  H.  STANLEY.                         3rd July, 1917.
                                              Board of Trade        6870if)   C.T.S./348                                           29th June, 1917. Dear Sir-Albert Stanley,     In view of the extreme pressure which is being put upon us to reduce the tonnage required for. the importation of timber, and the absolute necessity for largely increasing the production of Home Grown Timber, it seems essential that the existing War Office Orders on the subject of the protection of persons engaged In the exploitation of Home Grown Timber should be re-considered.  .     As you are probably aware, my predecessor, Sir Bampfylde Fuller, succeeded in securing a concessiom from the Director of  - Recruiting to the effect that men engaged in fell in??;, hauling or sawing timber who had then attained the age of 25&apos; and were medical- ly classified in categories B or 0, would not be called up for Military Service so long as they continued tc be so classified and employed.     These concessions were embodiec. in Army Council In- structions 540 of 29th March 1917.   On 4th May 1917,:under direct ir. Btructions.. of the &quot;ivar Cabinet, a.-revised Army-Council Instruction 730 was issued,  by which the concession was extended to men of all     vmedical categories, and the age was reduced to 23.  The new rule was to take  effect from the 29th March and an addition was alsomade including engine-hands under, sawyers.  Owing to the omission of the timber industry from the list of protected occupations,  this Army Council Instruction constitutes ^heir only protection.   So /- the case stands at present, except  that  the Recruiting Authoritieshave ruled that no recommendations  in respect of individual cases falling outside the general rule should be made in the case of menunder 23 who are medically classed  in A category.     There have,  of course, been a certain number of  transfers  of individual men serving at  home  to the  Reserve for  employment  on timber work, but the number is  not  large.   In the  last 3 weeks  we                               (1)
have submitted only 43 cases and in the same period, have receivedintimation of only 9 transfers.  This procedure has been practical!:confined to cases where firms are endeavouring to recover the ser-vices of men formerly in their employment, and it is necessarily.accompanied by some delay.  There has been no gBneral action for thetransfer of men from the Army to the Timber Industry.     It will be noted that the Army Council Instruction refers onlyto persons who on the- 29th March were engaged in felling, sawing(including engine-hands) or hauling timber1! or-were foremen ormanagers in. control of such men.  This last expression has beengenerallly construed&apos;as covering only those in. immediate control,and as excluding general managers of timber businesses, whosepresence is equally essential to the successful exploiting ofBritish timber.   : Udreoverthe date condition militates againstthe expansion of such operations^ and there have been severalinstances in which tile Recruiting Authorities have excluded a manfrom the protection of paragraph 1. on the ground that he has onlyrecently turned his attention to Home Grown Timber, which fact isregarded as throwing doubt on his good faith.  This suspicion mayor may not be reasonable, but the practical result is to preventthe expansion o f the industry.     Both the North of Scotland Timber Merchants Association andthe Home Timber Merchants Association of Scotland have approachedme on several occasions representing the difficulties which theyhave found in obtaining and retaining skilled labour, and I havebeen urged to move for the modification of the-existing Orders so,as to secure the exemption of all men engaged in timber work ofages from 18 to 22 inclusive.  It is understood that in Scotlandthese classes have been temporarily exempted until 7th July,  butthey are now receiving Notices calling them up,  and it has beenrepresented that their absence mil reduce the Scottish output ofsawn and rounded timber by about o-ne t-ijrfl,.     The revision of the Orders on the lines proposed is,  in myopinion, essential in order to prevent further disorganisation ofthe industry and diminution of output.  But, if the demands  of the
T274    Army and the minimum requirements of the Civil population are to   &apos;AKS uet, it will he necessary to go further and to secure the&apos; ser-    rices of skilled men on transfer from the Army in considerable num-    bers.  The output of Scotland in the year 1916 is calculated at    200,000 standards or rather over one million tons, and it is cal-    culated that the addition of 2,000 to 3,000 more skilled men    (together with the increased dilution by unskilled labour which    this would render possible) would result in the output being    doubled.  With further hands it might be possible to  raise the    Scottish output to half a million standards, or about half the    imports of the year 1916.  Making allowances for the  requirements    of England and iales the total number required would  be about    5,000 men.  It is further desirable that, in selecting these,  a    fair proportion of A and B class men should be included because    many timber operations (such as the felling of trees, the hauling    of logs out of the woods and the loading of them on to timber    waggons and railway trucks) require not only technical skill and    experience but considerable physical strength&apos;,         I would therefore press for the following measures       (a) a revision of irmy Council Instruction 730 so  as to stop           immediately any further recruitment of men&apos;engaged in           cutting, hauling, sawing or loading timber,  and foremen           engaged in supervision of such men without distinction           of age or medical classification.       (b) that this Department should be empowered to  recommend for           favourable consideration of the Recruiting Authorities  cases        t.  of managers or other persons whose business is essential to           exploiting the Home Grown Timber for exemption as special           cases, without distinction of age or class.       (c) that arrangements should&apos;be made for the transfer of 5,000           skilled fellers,  haulers,  sawyers and foremen;  of all ages           and classes from the Home Army to the Be serve,  so that  they           may be available for employment in the timber industry in &apos;           batches . as arrangements are made for their accommodation,           over a period of tv/o to three months.         In view of the gravity of the situation1.1 would  ask that  *    my proposals may receive early attention,  and may,  if necessary,    be brought before the War Cabinet.                                  I am,                                    Yours faithfully,n,  t*. tt   rt.                 &apos;   *  r     (Sgd)  J.B* all.be Rt.Hon,Sir Albert Stanley,  M.P.,            .
