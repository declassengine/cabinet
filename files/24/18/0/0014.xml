                     From Viceroy.  Foreign Department, 18th June 1917.                              (Repeated to Teheran, as 713 S.)                           (Received at India Office, 7 a.m., 19th.)[P 2506J      Secret.   Persia.  Reference to Teheran&apos;s telegram ] 98 V, of 9th June.         With our scanty knowledge of political developments Teheran,  we  feel         diffident of offering opinion on Ministers  suggestion that some modification         of our immediate policy in Persia may be necessary, but as  it seems  certain         that democrats will shortly  come into power  and will  meet with sympathy         from Russia we trust Ministers suggestion will receive fullest consideration         from Bis Majesty&apos;s Government.  It would  seem  desirable if possible to         anticipate Russians in sympathetic attitude towards democrats and  so far as         possible to conciliate latter before it is too late.  Otherwise, apart from other         and graver possibilities,  breakdown  of South Persia  Rifles  scheme would         appear probable.
