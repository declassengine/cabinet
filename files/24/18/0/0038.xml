                   Tn.?JtJJF -?l II JPlHCIIAH^ SHIPS       Memorandum by the Admiralty.    Glj/culated with reference           to war Offbinet 130, Appendix, Section.(f).       The following minute of the 77ar  Cabinet has  boon/under discussion by representatives of the Admiralty, . General  Post Office,  Board of Trade,, and Ministry of Shippings- .       &quot;At the meeting of the &apos;.7ar Cabinet on. the 2nd -May..it...       &quot;was de cide d; t h at the. A dm i r ail ty  in con c e r t w i th the- .     /&quot;General Post Office oncl&apos; the -War Office (provided; these/       &quot;Departments can offer any assistance) should train- the      - &quot;largest possible number of tireless  Telegraph Operators       &quot;with a.view to-the provision of at. least two efficient       -&quot; op e r a to rs. during-&apos; th e war i n e ve r y me r c h ant; ship&quot;       It.is probable, that.arrangements can.-be made by. the- Marconi Company to. provide both the necessary-apparatus  and personnel, but the Company will have to find a considerable amount of fresh capital for. the purpose (estimated at about  500,000), and. the. terms on which they can supply  ship owners will:depend on whether or not it will be compulsory for  the latter to retain wireless apparatus and operators  after  the war...  If the obligation comes to an end with the  war, the terms of the Company must be proportionately high, and:it will probably be necessary for;the;Government to.assist ship owners.       The  truest ion of obligation after the war also affects  the possibility of getting operators for draining, since  candidates are not likely.to come forward unless they have a  prospect of permanent  .employment.      &apos;.The  Departments  concerned theref ore ..ask that  they may be. informed --       (a)  Is the Government, prepared, to introduce  a Bill now making it  compulsory, after  the war for the following classes of ships to carry wireless and one fully trained operator, viz:           (i) Foreign goring steamships of 1600 tons and               over,, as defined in- the Merchant Shipping Act,/fSECRET
             .  i.e. Ships going between the TJhited Kingdom               and some place beyond the Continent of Europe               between the River Elbe and Brest.          fii)  All foreign-going passenger ships  and all             passenger ships crossing- between Ireland and               Great Britain, and Great Britain and the               Continent; and can the Marconi Company, be informed accordingly.       It is jointed out that under the Merchant  Shipping Convention.Act,  which will come into operation after thewar, it will be  compulsory for British ships registered in the United Kingdom,  and carrying 50 or more persons,  to carry wireless and one  operator.   So far as the Departments are able  to judge  the extension suggested above would be considered  reasonable by ship owners;  and the Departments&quot;recommend it as  a permanent statutory requirement.       (b) Alternatively,  do the ?/ar Cabinet wish  to be free of any obligation in respect of compulsory wireless after the war,  other than that already laid down under  the Merchant Shipping Convention Act.&quot;   In this event the arrangements for compulsory  wireless during the war will be considerably more expensive.        On receipt of a decision on these points a detailed scheme.will be drawn up..    Arrangements are&apos;meanwhile proceeding to train the largest number of wireless personnel that is possible with  the existing schools. ADMIRALTY,      88th June,1917.
