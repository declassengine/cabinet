I beg to submit  that in the consideration of Air RaidReprisals against Germany, the -following idea, suggested to me bySir Lionel Earle, should receive consideration;  namely, that anattempt be made to set alight during the dry summer weather, theBlack Forest at.various points.  I would point out that the BlackForest is not far situated from the Front, and&apos; that/it was possibleto raid Freiburg, which is practically on the outskirts of theForest, it is evidently possible to attack the Forest itself.The Black Forest, which I know intimately,-consists of very largestretches of pine timber;   there is practically no undergrowth,but there are large accumulations of pine needles and cones, whichare easily inflammable.  This is, perhaps, the most importanttimber supply for the German army on theWestern Front.  Its.totalor partial destruction would, therefore, be a military ob ;iec-t cfthe first importance.         I would submit&apos;that this object might be achieved bydropping large numbers of incendiary bombs in -different localities.-from aeroplanes,  Special  attention being directed to the metheds -by which the tops of the  trees, can be. set on-fire.        : Our Canadian officers.,  at present engaged--in tirobercutting in the French Forests,  will have a large experience offorest fires in Canada, and if they were consulted,  they couldprobably givo valuable advice on the technical execution of thjsscheme.
193mH. M.  Office  of  Works,     22nd  June,  1917...         The  scheme would bear  reprisal  cf  real military value,and at the same  time  would destroy valuable  assets  of  Germany,and,  if successful,-would.create very  great impressions-in Germany,as.well as satisfying public  opinion here,                                 (Signed)   Ao M0JID*
