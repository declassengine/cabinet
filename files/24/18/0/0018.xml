An inspection has been mj.deof all abattoirs &quot;throughout*the&quot;country at which cattle could beslaughtered for army requirements..   Thirty slaughtering centreshave been selected with due regard to railway facilities, and thenecessary adaptations are now being carried out under thesupervision of the Local Government Board..     2*  Arranff emeait s. for wrchase,.of JL,^!?;!:1^^.,$^$$^ Qjs&amp;tQthave met &quot;representatives of the Auctioneers of England, Wales andScotland, and the Sales Masters of Ireland,   Arrangements forthe equitable distribution over the United Kingdom of the cattlepurchased have now reached an advanced stage.     3*  -PXi-CA-^JiXiiiS0   The Committee have given most careful andsustained attention to  this question, and have examined a numberof witnesses.)          They have decided to purchase cattle for the army atfixed prices  per cwt. (live weight).          After taking  into account the price  of&quot;stores, thepresent prices of milk  and corn, the cost of production, and thenormal seasonal variation of meat prices, they have unanimouslysuggested that the maximum prices for army cattle should befixed as follows:-AugustSeptember,OctoberNovemberDecember77/- per cwt. live weight74/-  &quot;   &quot;     &quot;     &quot;72/-  &quot;   &quot;     ,;     u          These prices were recommended on the understandingthat the Food Controller would fix corresponding prices for meatsold for civilian consumption.          They have received resolutions from many quarters urgingthat the prices to be fixed should be made public immediately,  sothat there may be a considerable interval between the announcementof the fixed prices and the date on which they become operative *The Committee find it impossible to complete  their arrangementsfor purchase until the fixed prices are announced.     4i  &amp; 3AJ?Ji3 a&amp;fi.*   Inspection has been  made of the coldstorage accommodation at convenient centres.    Detailed estimatesof the necessary adaptations are now being prepared.     5a  ^The Committee have recommended that a centralorganisation be set up for controlling purchases for the army tobe financed through the Accounts Branch of the Board of Agriculture
and Fisheries.,    Communications on this subject have  beenforwarded to the Treasury and to the Office of Works.     fib&apos;ducied,,.,fare8..i.fori-\7oaen workers in agriculture.          It has become apparent that in order to provide farmerswith seasonal labour for such operations as fruit-, pea-  and hop-picking, it will be necessary to make arrangements for cheaptravelling facilities for women workers, most of whom are unableto -pay the fall ordinary rates plus the &amp;0% addition.    Lr.Prothere has written to Sir Albert Stanley with a view toarriving at an early settlement of the question, which is ofimmediate urgency owing to the near approach of the season forfruit and pea picking.   A conference was held on the  26th instantof representatives of the Departments concerned (the Board ofTrade, the Ministry of Labour, the National Service Department,the Railway Executive Committee and the Board of A/rr-iculture)but a complete scheme has not yet been arrived ato   The natteris however receiving close attention and it is hoped  that asettlement will be reached in the course of a few days&apos;  time.          The normal work of the  Board proceeds on the  linesindicated in previous reports and there is little of outstandingimportance or interest to report.   The alarm about thecaterpillar attack in Derbyshire  and Yorkshire has abated  and  itnow appears that no great damage  to crops  or valley pastures hasbeen done-   Very large numbers of the caterpillars have beendestroyed by flocks of rooks, starlings and sea-gulls .28th June 1917.
