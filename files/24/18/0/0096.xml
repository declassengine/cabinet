MAMMOTH  CARGO  SHIPS.SEGB8T,Q7CThe enclosed mmrandurn by Major General Collard.2nnity  Controller  for  Auxiliary Shipping, brings  out  early that in the factors which are limiting ouroutput of ships,  viz.,  Steel and-Men -        (1) .We get twice the tonnage capacity in                ordinary cargo ships that we should get                with the same man power and steel in                mammoth ships; .&apos;  .                    -  .        (2)  We get it  sooner;                           also        13)  We should  only be able to produce a very                limited number of these ships before the                end of  the War, however long it can in                reason  continue - say E or 3 years more&apos;;        (4)  Their use  would be restricted to a certain                limited number of ports - (3 in Great                Britain;&apos;        (5)  If damaged, they can only be docked in one                dry dock loaded,  and in four others if                partly  loaded, unless Admiralty Bocks are                used.      . These are more than fully                occupied now, and. could not be availeble *      In my opinion, these maniaoth ships would only justifythe excess of steel and labour and the  delay Involved intheir conetruetion if they were to run  uninterruptedly.
\fhey sill undoubtedly be attacked whenever possible, and having- regard to their great sige will form a most-  favour- able target.    We&apos; ?s&amp;y e^tpoot therefore, that they will receive considerable attention from ene?ny submarines, and the %im they will spend under repair will probably be above the average,  both on account of frequency of damage, and difficulty of getting a dry dock for them.          On the vfeole, from a production and repair point of vies?, I am of tho opinion that excellent though the design ana conception may be, the mammoth ship is a project for a future far, and not for this one.    When dry and wet docks of sufficient si go have been provided, they may be the passive reply to underwater warfare just as the large submersible cargo ship may. but I do not advise their adoption  at the present time.      Their limited use as cargo carriers end their liability to attack are not matters for ms to pronounce upon as 0ontroller, but I would point out that though doubtless the bulges are a great protection,  it is not safe to assume from the one case of the H.M.S. nQB t%OB? which was fitted with these  bulges and did not sink when struck by a torpedo that in all circumstances a ship with bulges would similarly escape.        There were fortuitous eireij stances in the &quot;GKAFTOl.&quot; case which prevent any definite, conclusion being drawn from that isolated experience.IBHEDJE  n PFnnc^4-7-17*                              Controller.
DEPUTY CONTROLLER OF AUXILIARY. SHIPBUILDING.SECRETJuly 2nd.  1917*MEMORANDUM ON MAMMOTH SHIPS WITH BULGES-.The araount  of  extra displacement entailed;bybuilding anti-torpedo bulges to merchant ships,  is  so  greatthat it is  not  an economical or feasible proposition exceptin the very largest ships  and this therefore limits the yardat which such ships could be built.   All the yards in GreatBritain which could lay down such a vessel are at the  presentmoment full?/ occupied on urgent war construction^ and  neither theberths nor  the  necessary labo/ur could be allocated to theconstruction of the mammoth merchant ship at the presentmoment.is differently  situated.   One end of their yard Is  laid outexpressly for building the largest type passenger steamer, andis therefore, suitable for the construction of  ships of thissort,  in addition to which the labour conditions in  Irelandmake It easier  to increase the labour in the Belfast yardsthan in similar yards in England.   It would, therefore, seemthat if the mammoth merchant ships are to be constructed atthe present juncture, they must unless other urgent work isto be. set aside, be constructed in Messrs.  Harland &amp; WolffrSyard at Belfast.Messrs.  Ilarland &amp; Wolfffs yard at Belfast, howeverAfter careful  consideration it would seem thatthe most  convenient size to build such ships is of thefollowing dimensions:-LengthBreadthDepth .700 feet, 90 feet. 52 feet.on account of the double bottom of  one  such ship beingavailable.
                                                                Qfi-2             The approximate particulars  of  such  a  ship  are;- Length  (between perpendiculars)                    ^OOVO1&apos; Breadth  (Moulded) including Bulge         ----     .   90&apos;0.&quot;  .

It would be possible to construct in the Belfast Yard two such ships, a double bottom for one being already partially constructed and material for a second double bottom  being Partially worked.             The Builders estimate that they could complete the first of such ships in 15 months and the second in 17 monthsbut this estimate is very optimistic and I am of the opinion after discussing the matter with my Advisors that in all probabilitywe should not get the first ship very much under 17  months,  unlessthe&apos;whole of the other work in the yard is made entirely secondaryto this  construction.   Before therefore embarking upon this pro-gramme of mammoth ships it is  ?/ell to compare them with merchantships of the ordinary type.
             Prom the Information which,has  been collected,it would appear that the ship which will give the biggestdeadweight tonnage output in the year from thc-hi^-yards-^is&apos;a vessel of a deadweight tonnage of about 11,000 tons,  andin yards where the capacity is not equal to  ships of this sizea vessel about 400 feet in length with a deadweight capacityof 8,000 tons.             It would therefore be as well to compare these threeclasses of vessels,Prom the Steel point of view,the quantityrequired for,             Mammoth Ship    ....     ....    14,700 tons,             11,000 ton Ship ....     ....     2,950 tons.              B,000 ton Ship ....     ....     2,220 tons.from which it will be seen that it is possible to build five11,000 ton Ships and 6.6.-8,000 ton ships the result beingthat with the same quantity of steel we should obtain in thecase of the:-             Mammoth Ship 26,900 tons of deadweight tonnage.             11,000 ton Ships 55,000      &quot;            &quot;             8,000 ton Ships 52,800       &quot;            &quot;the smaller ship in both cases showing nearly twice the dead-weight tonnage for the same amount of steel.             Comparing the lahour employed on these three ships,Messrs.Harland &amp; Wolff inform us that an average of 2,000 menwill bo employed on the mammoth ship for the period of 15months which they say It will take to construct,which periodof time as already pointed out   think is very conservative,                               I                  IThis gives a figure of 30,000 men months.,         t
                              U)    Similarly,  the 11,000 ton Ship will take 500 men,  10 months toconstruct,giving 5,000 men-months, and the 8,000 ton Ship will takea similar number of men eight months to construct giving 4,000men-months.          This  gives a result that the:-       30,000 men-months on the mammoth ship will give a deadweight             tonnage of 26,900 tons.       30,000 men-months employed on 450 feet ship will give a             deadweight tonnage of 66,000 tons.       30,000 men-months employed on the 400 feet ship will give              a deadweight tonnage of 60,000 tons.both of which are considerably more than double the tonnage of themammoth ship.    Again,comparing the question of time,we get this result              In the case of the 11,000 ton ship employing the same         amount of labour we should have 4 vessels floated with a         tonnage of 44,000&quot;tons for 5 months before the mammoth         ship could be put in commission,and before the mammoth was         out,half way through with the building of 4 other vessels              In the case of the 400 feet  ship, similarly we should         have 4 vessels giving 32,000 tons deadweight in commission         7 months before the mammoth ship  could be put in service,         and another four almost completed.              It will therefore,seem that  from the three pointsof view of Steel,man power and time, the mammoth ship comparesmost unfavourably with the construction of either the 11,000 tonor the 8,000 ton vessel.              In addition to these disadvantages the smaller boatscan be docked and discharged at practically all the ports inEngland whereas the large mammoth ship can only be unloaded inLiverpool,Southampton and Avonmouth and the dry-dockingfacilities in the case of repair are even  worse.   The only com-mercial dock which they can be taken into  fully loaded is theGladstone Dock,Liverpool.   They could,however,be taken into4 other commercial docks partially loaded.

If a mammoth ship protected with bulges could berelied up6n .to be absolutely unsinkable, it would present ofcourse considerable advantages but tire following facts must betaken into consideration : -                 These is not sufficient data to hand to prove    conclusively that the bulges will in all cases protect a    ship as we only have the one experience of the &quot;Grafton&quot;    to go on up to the present, and it is hardly safe to    assume from this one instance the absolute protection by    bulges, as the circumstances in the &quot;Grafton&quot; case    introduce a considerable element of fortuity.                 It is certainly quite possible that both the    propellers might be damaged by torpedo attack in spite of    the central fin protection, in which case the vessel    would be helpless.                 Proposals have also been got out to fit bulgesto a partially built vessel now under construction with Messrs^Earland and Wolff, particulars of which are given as under v-

Approximately 3,000 tons                                        additional for bulges.            This vessel has a deadweight carrying capacity of18,000 tons.  If she is completed as a cargo carrier she willrequire about 2,200 tons of steel.  If she has the bulgesfitted to her she will require approximately a further 3,000tons of steel, which will not give her any additional carryingcapacity.  Further she could be completed as an ordinary cargocarrier in from six to seven months, but if the bulges are to beadded it would take, according to Messrs. Harland &amp; Wolff&apos;sown estimate, from 16 to 17 months to complete which shows thatto add bulges to this ship not only means an addition of 3,000ions of steel, but a loss of 10 months in the use of thissteamer with a deadweight tonnage capacity of 18,000 tons.            In conclusion, therefore it would appear that:-&quot;            MammofchAiships with bulges cannot be built onanything like a large Bcale, the utmost that could atpresent be done would be to build two and convert one ,  noneof which would be available under 15 months and it wouldprobably be nearer 18 months before they are in commission.
       By building ordinary  cargo  carriers we should gettwice the amount of tonnage  in  the same  time, but half ofit would be available  much earlier.Major General,    D.C.A.S.
