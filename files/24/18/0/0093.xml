J ^ Wr. .-d t 0REPORT relating to     Scotland forf the Board of Agriculture for  th July, 1917.   Food Production(a) Agricultural. Work.       The weather continues to he dry and hay cutting has commenced  in   some of the  earlier districts. ,   1 *  District  Agricultural Committees.       Committees are at present proceeding with their preliminary   surveys for  next year&apos;s crop and it is understood that  favourable   response  is  being  given to their appeals..       During  the week  a representative  of  the Board visited the  Selkirk.   Heirose and  Jedburgh  Committees and also  addressed a large meeting  of   farmers at Kelso where a resolution to support the Pood Production   Scheme for 1918 was unanimously carried. ;   2.  Compulsory  Orders  under the Defence of the Realm.Regulation  2 M.       The  Board have  issued an Order taking  formal entry to the  part  of   the&apos;&apos;J)eer  Forest  of Inverailort known as An  Stac  extending to  1,842   acres. This area  will be let at cnoe  to  a  neighbouring farmer  on a   lease  extending  to two years after the War  for the purpose of re-   etocking  with  sheep *       A further Order  is about to be issued  taking entry to the  lands   of Choille-Gharbh  extending to 641 acres  being part  of  Dundonnell   Deer  Forest  for  the purpose of re-letting as sheep grazing to the   crofters  of  Canusnagall to whom the same  lands were  conditionally   assigned  by  the  Crofters Commission as enlargements  of  holdings in   January  1912.  An  appeal by the Estate has  up to the present  prevented   the crofters from  taking aotual possession.   3* Agricultural  Implements.        The  Board have decided to take over  i.: from Committees as  from   let September  next all motor tractors, ploughs and cultivators&apos;which   have been supplied by them and thus relieve Committees  of all finan-   cial obligations in connection with the purchase and management of   these Implements.  (Copy circular attached).   4 v Deer  Forest Grazings.        After a conference with  their officers, who have been conducting   a survey of Deer Forests with a view  to ascertaining the possibilities   of obtaining sheep etc.  grazings  thereon, the Board  decided to  issue   a circular to deer forest  owners warning  them  that the  Board  have been   empowered to plaoe stock on  deer  forests.  It was considered  that a   warning of this.kind should be  given  in order  to give proprietors an   opportunity of preparing  for  the  change by reducing  the numbers of   deer or otherwise.   5 * Supply of Shotgun Ammunition  for Agricultural Purposes.  -        Arrangements  have now been made with the Ministry  of Munitions   for the supply to  farmers  and  others  of shotgun  cartridges on licence   by the Executive Officers  of District  Agricultural Committees or by   other officials  in districts  where the District  Agricultural  Com-    imittees are not in active operation.   Cartridges can  only be   supplied meantime.for the purpose  of  killing vermin  or  the preserva-   tion of crops but  the Board hope  to be able to arrange  with the   Ministry of Munitions for the  inclusion  of the provision of food as   one cf the&apos; reasons for. - issuing- a-, licence.
6 * Sup-ply of Farm Hoy see.     The Board have addressed a circular to Committees requestingparticulars as to the number of extra horses that will berequired during the coming season for the increased acreage to bebroken up and put under crop.7 - Defence of the Realm Regulation 2 T:  Sale of Agricultural Horses.

BOARD OF AGRICULTURE FOR  SCOTLAND,                  29  ST. ANDREW SQUARE,                                EDINBURGH.                          28th --Juris,  1917.Sir,                   &apos;&apos; .,\.                    Agrioultural Implements          I am directed  by the Board of Agriculture;for  Scotlandto state that they have  had under consideration the question ofthe repayment of annuities by District Agricultural Committeesin respect of agricultural implements supplied by the Board.          Reviewing the  past season&apos;s operations and having regardto the experimental nature of the scheme of distribution,  theBoard refer to the following facts which have been prominentlybrought to light.  In some cases the tractors supplied were foundto&apos;be unsuitable for  the district to which they were allocated. -Generally the expenditure incidental, to the. working of the&quot;motorploughs proved to.be  unexpectedly heavy because of-the absence ofa general scheme of management and a unified system of&apos;control.Only a comparatively  limited amount of ploughing was done  by meansof the motor ploughs  in most counties owing to the inclemency ofthe weatheri or on account of breakages and the inexperience ofthe tractor drivers.   In the circumstances Committees have withfew exceptions been unable to show a favourable return for theseason&apos;s ploughing.   The.Board are satisfied that - wb ile-the- &apos;various Committees have done their utmost to ensure the  successfulworking of the scheme, the receipts obtained from farmers  forploughing and cultivating have been BO small as to render  itpractically  impossible for Committees to repay in the  stipulatedperiod the capital with interest of implements supplied  by theBoard.  They therefore consider it expedient to take  over, as from1st September next, all motor tractors, ploughs and cultivatorswhich have been supplied by them.  In view of the experience  :  .which has been.gained during this past season the Board  aredisposed to  think  that your Committee will welcome this  suggestionas relieving them  of. a financial obligation whioh it  seemsprobable they would  not be able to discharge.           In order to facilitate the completion of arrangementsfor giving  effect  to  the proposed transfer on the date mentionedI am to request that  you will forward to this Office  at  as earlya date after 1st September as may suit convenience a  full  state-ment showing the receipts and expenditure  incurred under therespective  headings  of.motor tractors, ploughs and cultivators.          As /  Any farther communications should bedressed, Maot to any individual by name,t to-ifnE SECRETARY, BOARD OF AGRICULTURE FOR SCOTLAND,    29 ST. ANDREW SQUARE,              EDINBURGH.&quot;respondents are requested: fo quote the Number, Date, and Headingof each letter to which they reply; andfo let communications on different subjectsform separate letters, ^ty ggl     No....................ifizraDliio Address-&quot;BOAS, EDINBURGH.&quot;The Secretary,   District Agricultural Committee,
          As.regards the question of the adjustment of detailsin connection with the management of the tractor-ploughs,  theBoard desire me to suggest that when making agreements withfarmers as to the conditions on which they may have their  landploughed you should arrange with them for the cartage of thenecessary  supplies from the railway-station at which they mayhe delivered to the field where ploughing is to he done.  TheBoard oonsider that this cost ia one that should properly  hemet by the farmers themselves.  It is advisable that wheneverpossible agreements with farmers should be made in writing andthat the motor-engineers should be informed in advance of  theorder in which your Committee propose the ploughing should bedone.  It is desirable also that farmers should -y&amp;erever possiblemake arrangements for the billeting of the tractor-drivers, thecost of which will be defrayed by the motor-engineers.  In caseswhere military operators are employed the accommodation providedby farmers will require to be, in the opinion of the local Sub-Commissioner to the National Service Department,  both adequateand ample for the purpose.          I am to add that Mr R.  D.  Iwart,  Controller  of theMotor Tractor Department,  will shortly visifc  the  district anddiscuss with you the above arrangements and any other  matterswhich may require elucidation.I am,  Sir,   Your obedient  Servant,       H, M.  COHACHER,                 Secretary.
