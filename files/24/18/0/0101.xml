- 1 -CRET.Intelligence Bureau^ Department of Information.WEEKLY  REPORT  ON  FRANCE      July 5th 1917.    , G&apos;f actual occurrence  in France during the last fortnightthere ie not much  to  say.    The  report on Constitutional Revision,the announcement of the  oroposed new taxes,  the Secret Session aboutthe Offensive,  the arrival of the Americans,  a^e among the outstandingevents.    What is  obvious  about  them calls for no comment here; and whatis not obvious,  rs for inatRnoythe relations between the Chamber andthe Army,  remains  for the  ^resent obscure.   All that is known is thatpressure is being  put on the Government to follow the preoedent of 1793an5 *.et the Chamber send Commissioners to be with the irmies and act as asort of travelling body  of civil Inspectors,  enquiring into the com-plaints of soldiers and,  in practice if not in theory, sitting in judge-ment on generals and  other officers accused of inoompetence or neglect,of duty.  To this.  General Pe;tain is resolutely opposed;  indeed he wishesto have more power than  he now has to refuse leave to politicians tovisit the front.   It is said however that he may accent a compromiseproviding for the  creation of 2  or 3 Uncer Secretaries of State who willhe attached to the Armies,  as official representatives of the Minister ofWar at the Front.   But &quot;nothing  it) settled,  nor v/ill be probably forsome days.    The Secret  Session  is not yet concluded.     This agitation is the Parliamentary reflection of the general waveof dissatisfaotion and even discouragement which has prssed everFrance of late.    So  far as the  soldiers are concerned not much need besaid here as allusion has  been made to It in previous reports.    That it
exists and  is  even rather wide-spread  there  is  no  doubt,  and there isequally no  doubt that rumour has  exaggerated it.    I have so far seenno trust worthy evidence that it  has l$idto  anything very serious or                               cdefinite.    It has a variety of eauses:   the vague unrest produced amongall the peoples by the Russian Revolution and the  language of itsextremists:  exaggerated rumours  about the strikes in Paris disturbingthe minds of the soldiers:   the comparative  failure of the Frenchoffensive:   pacifist propaganda:   and  above  all dissatisfaction with thefailure -o   the Army authorities to carry  out the promises made,  perhapstoo rashly,  about regular leave.    But of all this perhaps enough hasalready been said.   The only thing to add is that the widespread., demandin very opposite sections of the  Press for an alleviation of the soldier^lot is in course of being met so  far as possible by M. Painleve.   Thelately introduced system of  giving the regiments money to feed themselvesinstead of  providing the food is  said  to  have worked badly, and is to beabolished.   It left the men with money in their pockets, because therewas not enough food to buy - with the  result that  they bought other andless desirable things which  did not make  for content or discipline.With this reform, and the other promises  of  M.  Painleve as to leave andthe prospective release of many miners and agriculturists, the spiritof the Army will probably improve, especially with the help of theAmerican and Russian news.    But the unrest has extended to the civil population as well.  Howfar, it is  again very difficult to say.    Hot so far, it stems certain.as to produce  any definite action.   An experienced observer who has beenin Peris  for a long time writes emphatically, eas  the result of personalinvestigation, that  &apos;the  &quot;street&quot; is not  ugly&apos;  though there were elementsof danger  in the strike meetings  and processions.    Going into the midstof the strikers  in  the Place de la Republique while the recent strikes
were going on, ha found  the people  &quot;movingadvice of a good-natured police&quot;  and  not  1about on the insistentnot losing its temper over thefew incidents of friction that occurred.   This does not look likethe mood that causes revolutions;  and though it is fair to notethat other residents in France take a ,?rr.ver view, I have not heardof anyone who claims to have himself witnessed anything serious.He doubt the temper of a people is P difficult book to. rerd.   But itseems reasonable to orgue that if it had been really b* d so manystrikes ?/ould have led to some disturbances that could not be con-cealed.    Still the waters of the French mind have certainly been troubled -and that may be the explanation of the reappearance - not exactly onthe stage but at any rate behind the scenes - of that fisher in troubledwaters, M.  Caillaux, whose name is again in many oeople&apos;s mouths.This has chiefly been in connection with the appearance of a new dailypaper,  Le Pays, which evidently has very strong financial suuuort,  suchas M.  Caillanx is just the man to provide,  besides expressing in themain just the opinions ho is known to hold.   The Paper is very wellwritten-and has published some excellent and irreproachable articles,one or two being almoet trumpet calls to endurance and energy,  anddenunciations of a German peace as a &apos;paix d&apos;e3clavagef,  certain to leadto a renewal of war in a 7ear or two.   But,  say its enemies,  sucharticles are only the bait to catch the fish.   The majority of thearticles, especially in the first week or two of the paper&apos;s existence,were cautious and veiled insinuations against the policy of continuingthe war.    Ilone,  or scarcely any,  are openly -pacifist:   but the con-tinual dropping of hints has an unmistakable tone about  it.    One dayit is  the state of the  rmy and its need of representatives of theChamber in its midst,  the necessity 6f making officers  answer  with  theirheads  for their failures,  an insistence that every soldier should leam
 f  that the aim of the war is nation?! and limited,  the  expulsion of the  enemy from France ?-nd Belgium, a security against future  wars and  nothing else (pos autre chose)    Another day it  is an  attack in  respectful language on the breaved parents who  issued an  appeal  against premature peace.   On&apos;another  there  is  an article complaining  that all forms and tenses of the verb  to grow weary are treated as  seditious by the Censor.   On another  a demand  for knowledge  at all  costs of the causes of the failure of  the Government, and afl  assertion  that everybody is allowed to live on illusions.    Others  are  attacks  on  the unnecessary irritations of discipline;   and one, perhaps the  meat significant of all, demands thrt  peace  when  it comes should not  find Fronce covered with wreaths of Glory, but  on her deathbed,  sick to  death.   The general trend is plain, and the object of  such articles  coming at such a time c:&apos;n scarcely be  doubted.    It is  to suggest that  France ie being bled white by the present policy  and  that the situation  is  intolerable, which means that it must be  ended, which  means,  or at  least suggests, that a bad perce would be better  than the continuance  of  the war.      Other papers have arid things of  this sort before.    The seriousness  of  these articles lies in the fact that they appear in  a  new  paper of the  first order, started now in spite of all the difficulties under which new  papers are suffering, and evidently circulated  regardless of  expense;   an!  perhaps still more in the universal belief that they  are  inspired byI  M,  Caillaux.I     &apos;;                                                       -           ----                                   &apos;    -                   -  -. -          -      That has been the principal cr-use of the violent polemic which they  heve excited.   M. Leon daudet of the  Action Francaise  amd M.  Herve of                                                   3 :  the Victoire have denounced the new paper in .i  series of  articles forI Pts invidious attempts to sap the 1 moralof the  trmy and nation and  accused it of working for a German peace.    Above all the./ demand to
know who is behind it and call attention to its articles of associationwhich forbid hhe Editor, (a journalist with no very savoury past) todisclose under any circumstances the names of those who have founded  thepaper.   In particular M. Herve call3 upon M. Caillaux to say whether heis or is not it3 founder.     This has produced some journalistic vituperation on both sides,into which there is no need to go here.   What would appear moreimportant is that it ultimately produced a statement by the Editor dfle Pays definitely denying, tho&apos; with many expressions of esteem, thatM. Caillaux is the founder of the pawer, and offering to submit the namesof the shareholders to the President of the Committee of the Paris Press-But this denial will not be tsken by mtst people to have any moremeaning than that M. Cailleux^s name does not appear in the list, amatter of very little importance.   Everything points to the paper being-his.   Its views are exactly what are known privately to be his:its financial strength points to him:  end its appearance , with that ofa weekly comtemporary, Les Notions, has coincided with an attempt on  hispart to emerge again into the daylight from the dusk of obscurit^and, asis believed, of intrigue, in which he has lived since the war began,  andindeed since the scandal which threetene.d to destroy him altogether.He has been founding or trying to found a new party celled la LigueHepublicaine.   The tone this party at once took up under his leadershipwas suoh that two of its most prominent members immediately seoeded andthat M. Caillaux had to set to work in the lobbies, his usual sphere  ofoperations, to explain that it was not an unpatriotic body and that hehad himself laid down at its preparatory meeting that the question ofAlsace wes one that was not open to discussion.   But confidential^information sgggests that his explanations ^ere not very favourablyreceived r-nd that there is quite a possibility that the League which was
 Lrtainly meant to revive his influence may  prove  a  stillborn child.   Helad proposed to inaugurate it by a meeting at  the  Trocadero  hut this seems to have been forbidden or fallen through,  and  it  is  even said that the Government has requested M.&apos; Caillaux  to leave  P*ris.    In any case his attempt to rehabilitate himself seems to have failed this time at any rate.   But  his ability, wealth, power ofIntrigue, and freedom from scruple ere unquestioned,  and he  will be leard of again, though probably not  just yet.    He is a man  to watch. lere is n* doubt of his pacifism which has  already  exhibited itself  in                                            isn$re than one intrigue during the War.   Nor/there much doaibt of his friendliness to England in spite of protestations  which  he makes to ndividual Englishmen.   He has always been  mixed  up with  internetional, nd especially with German, finance, end though  he may  fairly plead that[few men in the big business world could avoid  that,  he  has certainlysomehow always created the impression even more  thsn most  financiers,bat his motto^was simply Business is business,  no matter  where *r with(whom it 1B done.   He is s men whom  it is very difficult to  read, but itis certain that he is regarded with  the greatest suspicion in what, fromthe point of view of those who wish  the Grand  Alliance  all possible lifeend vigour, are the^est1 quarters in every  country  that belongs to it.He is known to have had agents in some Allied  Countries who  make it theirbusiness to tell people that Prance  is weary of  the  war and  to hint thatthe present statesmen are played out.   He undoubtedly  worked behind  thescenes in the recent attempt to create a Presidential crisis.    On thewhole it must be said that if the world is mistaken  in  thinking him lesspatriotic ernd more intriguing that his neighbours, no friend to England,and no enemy of an inconclusive peace, he has  only himself to thank.q   It is, of course, his attitude  towards  ourselves that is of speoialinterest to us.   One may note that  his enemy, II.  Leon  Daudet,  definitely
accuses him of hating England-ss the chief obstacle to a bad peace,and consequently of working always to undermine the English Alliance.And hi3 paper is tertainly not distinguished by its enthusiasm for us.On the contrary one of its demends,  put forward in a very peremptoryarticle,  is that M. Painleve should insist on the extension of theEnglish front before the autumn.   This demand whioh appears alsoelsewhere may or may not be one that the British military authoritiescan consider favourably.   In any c se to press it publicly cannotimprove the relations of the two countries.    It must encourage theFrench in their curious delusion that they and they alone have sufferedand died in this war,  and that the British Army has no other task in allthe world except thfc protection of the soil of France.   This occasionall;irritates the most patient of Englishmen.   It is not merely thatvisitors to Paris report that they find more able bodied men walkingabout the streets there than in London.   It is also th?t the Frenchnever seem to realise the frets of our respective situations.   Supposethe positions were reversed and that England were invaded and France onlyindirectly attacked, are they quite sure that they would be occupying athird, or anything like a third, of the line of battle on English soil?Would they think it reasonable thet we should expect them not only to dothat but to do more?   The truth is that they have not even yet at allrealised how much we have done, either the magnitude of our effort or ofour sacrifice for the common cause,  b^ which they of all the Alliance,more even than ourselves,  have been the first to benefit.    They knowlittle of naval matters:  for fear of drawing attention to the extentFrance now depends on us,  their papers are officially discouraged fromgiving too much space to the doings of the British Army:  and for fearof comparisons the French Government h^-s not allowed any information GObe published as to the sacrifices made by the British taxpayer to the
                       - 8 -neral cause.    It is,  however, satisfactory to ncte  that  the  Debate, discussing the proposed new taxes&quot;, has lately been  allowed to  ooint  ou[iat up to last Christmas no new taxes had&apos;been imoosed in  France and.at even to-day France  is still a long way from asking of  its  taxpayersch sacrifioes as have  been accented by those both cf her  Alliesd&apos;&quot;b  her enemies.   It is well&apos;tp have this admission from a  Frenchpar....  One hopes it. will nctoass unnoticed in France.
