DEEMARE              The Danish Delegates, at the recent London Con-              ference, refused to promise a voluntary limitation of              Danish  imports of cereals, fodder, oils and fats.  They              also declined to reduce the exports of Cattle to Germany              to the  pre-war level (about 5,000 head a week); or to              guarantee the maintenance of the 1916 scale of export of              agricultural produce to Great Britain.  The inducements                                                                      li              which we offered were a supply of coal, at the rate of                                                                      I              100,000 tons a month, and a &quot;bonus on bacon and butter;              but the delegates regarded our demands as &quot;political&quot;,              and refused them on that ground.  H.M. Government have              decided to embargo the importation of cereals, fodder and] I              margarine materials into Denmark without waiting for the              cooperation of the United States.  But Sir C. Spring Rice              will invite the United States to cooperate in this policy I              and will explain to them why we have acted independently. j              The reason is that we could not allow the Danes a time of              grace which they would utilise for the accumulation of           .   stocks.  It is however probable that the draft shipping              agreement will be ratified by the Danish shipowners.  In j              that case the Danes will get 100,000 tons of coal a month, I              and special facilities for the vessels which they  retain  j              in Danish tradesj  we shall obtain the use of 200,000     !              tons dead weight of Danish shipping.   Our drastic policy              in regard to cereals, fodder and margarine materials              is not  altogether unwelcome to those  Danes who believe              that their country1s interests are bound up with ours.              Denmark can make herself practically  self-sufficient
s -            in respect of food.   Banish exports of cattle will  in-            crease for a  times   but  this is  the season when they will            be least useful to Germany, and we may expect that in a            few months Denmark1 s power to supply Germany will he            seriously and permanently impaired.SWKDEII*         H.M. Government have offered to accelerate the release            of Swedish grain cargoes  if the Swedish Government- will            grant free transit to and from Russia for all commodities            not specified as wax material in the Decree of March 1915,               E.M.Government doubt whether the United States can            compel Sweden to refuse all supplies of iron ore to            Germany.   Iron ore Is the principal commodity which            Sweden gives  in exchange for German coal, without which            Swedish industries would be paralysed and the Eussian          .transit traffic would be seriously affected.  But a  redue-            tion in the present scale of export of iron ore (which is            quite abnormal) can probably he secured if the United            States will take firm action in the matter.               When M. Thomas was in Stockholm on the 10 th June,  -            Admiral Lindman appealed to  him for a more lenient treat-           ment of Swedish imports.  M. Thomas replied  that this            could only he expected when Sweden1s mercantile  marine            resumed the ordinary services to Allied Countries.   It is            thought that this frank statement will produce an excellent            effect at Stockholm.   .               The vessels of the Allies are passing out of the            Baltic through the Eogrund Passage more slowly than was            at  first anticipated.   But it does not appear that the            Swedish Government are to  blame for the delay.
NORWAY.         We are pointing out to  the United States  that,  if            they delay ranch longer in applying pressure to Norway,            we shall he obliged to pay  excessive  prices for Norwegian            molybdenite and fish,  in order to prevent  these articles            from reaching Germany.   A  word from  the United States            weald enable us to  secure this object without adding            further to our financial burdens,                The agreement with the  Norwegian  Shipowners is now            practically complete,  and we are about to requisition            the vessels reserved to us  under the  agreement.                The United States  propose  to make purchases of            Norwegian pyrites,  in  order to be less dependent on            Spain for this article.   Such purchases would be useful            to the Allied cause.    At present the Norwegian producers            of non-cupreous pyrites hope to dispose of their output            in Germany.ITETHERLANDS.     There is  some ground for believing that the recent            potato-riots  In Rotterdam were  indirectly fomented by the            Dutch authorities,  to  inflame public  opinion against our            Agricultural  Agreement.   The truth Is that Holland is            under  no  obligation to  supply  this country with potatoes            unless she is  supplying  them to the Central Powers.                No further letters  of assurance will be granted for            Cargo  going to  Holland, until the Dutch Government make            aeceptable proposals concerning the export trade  in            Potatoes  and  Cattle.SPAIN.    Sl* A.  Hard Inge has received unofficial hints thatthe reconstructed Spanish Cabinet will be more accommo^dating than that of Senor Garcia Prieto*  But Senor Date
             has not yet taken action to ourh the activity of (Jerma$             submarines in Spanish waters,  fwo neutral vessels were             sunk in these waters on June 20.  We are asking the             United States to join with us in a protest to the Spanish             Government *   The representatives of ^e Allies at Madrid             continue to press for the internment of the submarine             EUQ.52.*  SWITgEKMHD..    E*I.Government will in future supply the Swiss             munition factories which work for the Allies with 3,000             tons of coke a month.                 The Swiss Government have taken energetic measures             to suppress the smuggling trade with Germany.*  ITALY.          She Italian Government published on June 27 a             decree prohibiting the export of ell thrown silk.   The             decree comes into force at once and applies to current             contracts for the new crop.   But the Italian Government             hope that we will not object to the fulfilment,  in the             course of July, of old contracts for last seasons silk.*  -SREBtiBy         On June 20 the Minister of Blockade notified the             War Trade Department that prohibited goods may now he             licenced to  all parts of Greece, if theneeessary recom-             mendations are made fcy H.M.Minister at  Athens.   The issue             of letters of assurance for shipments going to Greece has             also been authorisef.                 H*! * Government desire that  the new  Greek: Government             should only  he allowed the absolute minimum of Greek             merchant ships which will suffice  for making necessary             imports and  continuing essential passenger  services.   It %             however improbable that any ships  at present allocated to

Theneed arises from the recent losses of important oilcargoes*    The decision of the President on the Policy to bepursued in restricting supplies to neutral Europe hasnot yet been announced and is anxiously awaited.110.
