              TREATMENT AND TRAINING.14,       The necessary instructions for the administrationof treatment and training under Art. 6. of the Royal Warrantand Order in Council have now been prepared for issue toLocal Committees.          A proof of these instructions which will be issuednext week In slightly revised form, forms Appendix VIII tothis Report.   Their preparation has involved considerablelabour, it being the first occasion on which it has beennecessary to draw general directions for the guidance ofLocal bodies in providing either special treatment orIndustrial training for any considerable body of men.          In the sphere of treatment a soheme for generalpractitioner treatment was prepared for the purpose of theNational Insurance Acts, but this did not extend tospecialist treatment in Hospitals or otherwise, and it hasconsequently now been necessary to work out arrangementsby which disabled men, who need more than the generalpractitioner oan give them, may obtain specialist treatmenton linea satisfactory from a medical point of view.  Theabsorption of a great number of the Medical profession inMilitary Service has enhanced the difficulty of making thenecessary arrangements and the scheme must, in some of itsfeatures, be regarded as provisional, and subject tomodification when normal conditions are restored.          The arrangements proposed for treatment are inoutline as follows          (a) Before the man&apos;s discharge from Military          Service the Medical Officer of the Hospital will          certify as to any further treatment that the man&apos;s          condition may require, and either the Ministry or          the man1s Local Committee will provide the treat-          ment accordingly.                                                      (b)
        (b)  If at any time after his discharge the man        is found by the Local Committee to need treat-: .        ment, he will if the case is one of wound or        injury, be sent to a &quot;suitable Military Hospital,        and in any other case to a civil hospital, or        otherwise be dealt vrith in accordance with the        advice of a Medical Referee, to be. appointed by the        Minister of Pensions. . These Referees will be        appointed for special areas in all parts of the        Kingdom.           As regards  training the Ministry,  acting  inconsultation with the Ministry of Labour, has  aimed in  theInstructions at providing  training  fir disabled men of  sothor ugh a kind that  the man shall have a reasonable-chance- of  securing a permanent livelihood as the resultof it, and in  order to secure that  this training, whichmust necessarily be shorter than would be required  ofapprentices, shall not conflict with the interests  oftrades.   The  Trade Advisory Committees appointed by theMinistry of Labour are advising as tthe conditionsunder which the. training shall be given.          Pull explanatory Notes on the various, kinds oftreatment and  training: t) be given, and on the machineryfor obtaining  it are appended to the: Instructions.                      ORGANISATION.15.       A statement of the proceedings of the StatutoryCommittee for  th:  week ending June. 27th is annexed(Appendix IX).    -It embodies reports by Inspectors ofAccounts on the work of the Lanarkshire,  Rotherham,  ,:iganand Manchester VJar Pensions Committees which chow varietyIn views os to  sanctity of regulations but are on thewhole satisfactory,   As regards  London,  the  Sub-Committeef-^r Eermondsey have apparently a difficult area and that                                                   for
Illfit the City of London a very easy one.   The work isreported to be well done at Stepney, Lambeth and Battersea.16.       At very short notice it was decided by theGovernment Whips to introduce on the 28th and to read asecond time on &quot;the.29th a Bill to provide for transferringthe powers, duties,  and functions of the StatutoryCommittee to the Minister of Pensions and the RoyalPatriotic Fund Corporation.  The Bill as so introducedand read forms Appendix X to this Report and a fullexplanation of its genesis and contents is contained InAppnndix XI.   In introducing the Bill the Mirfeter paida tribute to the work that had beer: done by the StatutoryCommittee and its Vice-Chairman - Mr. Cyril Jackson -explained the impossibility of a continuance of the sideby side working of the Ministry and the Committee, andindicated that supplementation of Separation Allowancesand advances of pensions and allowances as well as treat-ment and training were to be taken over by the Ministryand discretionary grants by the Patriotic Fund Corporationwhich was to be given more of a popular character by havingfour Members of its executive appointed by the Government.He. further announced that it was proposed to put thePatriotic Fund Corporation in funds by a grant of  260,000out of the million that had been provided for theStatutory Committee, the balance of this provision revert-ing t&quot;! the Exchequer.          Mr. Hogge  made a complimentary reference to Mr.Jackson.  He agreed in principle with the Bill which co-ordinated all the schemes dealing.with pensions.    Hedeprecated however the intervention of a charitable  bodysuch as the Patriotic Fund Corporation in matters dealingwith pensions to soldiers and their dependants,  even inassistance to the widows of men shot for desertion.   He                                               thought

Mr CharlesRoberts disagreed with Mr. Hoggfs objections to theproposed use of the Corporation.  Mr. Harris and Mr. Allenas Members of the Statutory Committee approved the Bill.Sir Arthur Boscawen indicated that certain minor objectionsto the Bill that had been raised in debate would be met.It was read a second time without a division,17,       A . copy of the  third number  of  ::The  war -Pensions.&apos;&apos;Gazette&quot;  is  annexed  (Appendix XII) and attention  is  calledto Mr. John  Galsworthy&apos;s  leading article on  treatment  andtraining  (paragraphs 21  and 22) to the account of  the  workof the T.rt Pensions Committee of the  County  of Haddington(paragraphs  26 and 27) and of that of the  limb fittingHospital  at  Roehampton..

J    5. The alternative pension to  a widow is limited to thcfl cases  where the widow was married to the sailor or solcl before the war or before the  date of his enlistment if subs] quent  to the  war. Widows  who married  after the manl enlistment or mobilisation are only eligible for the  mini::: &apos;j: pension. .

 Temporary Pensions to Widows under Article 15 of the Royal                       .  Warrant.   6. Under Article  15 of  the Royal Warrant  a temporary pension of 15s. a week may be granted for the duration of the war  and for 12 months afterwards to the widow  of a sailor or soldier who dies of wounds,  injuries or disease neither attribu- table to military service nor  certified as aggravated by such service but not due to the serious negligence or misconduct of the  deceased man.  This temporary pension, in view  of the conditions under which it  is  granted, must ordinarily  be re- garded  as the maximum recompense which can be granted to the widow.   As a general rule, therefore, a widow pensioned under this Article will not  be  eligible  for a Supplementary Allowance under the  new Regulation.   A few cases may arise, however, in which the man&apos;s death was, in the opinion of the  Local Committee, clearly due to circumstances arising  out of  his war service, and where the case is  also one of exceptional hardship.   Application for  a supplementary allowance may be made.in these cases,  and should be accompanied by a full statement as to the circum- stances in which  the man  met with his death and,  where necessary, by medical or other evidence tending to connect his death with his war service.  The maximum supplementary allowance under the regulation is 10s., and in no case  will a supplementary allowance be  granted which, together with the temporary pension, will exceed the amount of the minimum pension for herself and children which could have been granted to the widow, if eligible, under Articles 11 and 12  of the  Royal Warrant.                   .   (b) Dependants.   7. The definition  of pre-war  dependence in the Royai Warrant, which now  applies in the case  of these  Regulations, excludes, in the case of men enlisting after the outbreak of war, any increase of dependence created by special war wages.                         Parents.   8. Under the Royal Warrant a pension may be grantedto a wholly or&apos;partly, dependent parent* up to  the amountof the pre-war dependence, subject to a maximum of 15s.;  *   There is  no - alternative pension provided for  dependants,but  the  abolition  of  the distinction  drawn in the previouswarrant  between  wholly  dependent  and partly dependentparents,  together  with the  higher maximum now  payable,   *&quot; Parent&quot; as defined in the Royal Warrant includes, a grandparent or otherperson who has been in the place of a parent to the sailor or soldier and has -whollysupported him for not less than one year at some tiine before the commencementrofthe war.
  will render the &quot;great majority  of  dependants ineligible for  a supplementary  allowance.&apos; Instances may arise,  however,  where the maximum pension&apos; of 15s. a week is&apos; considerably .&apos; less than the pre-war dependence, and where the case is one  of  exceptional hardship.  In these cases application may be  made for a supplementary allowance on Form P.  2  (revised).  Earnings or earning capacity,  and other income  determined  in  accordance with the Instructions to the  previous Regu-  lations  (Part I), . must be taken into account, and, together  with the State pension, these items  must not in total exceed  80  per cent,  of the pre-war dependence and other income,  or a sum of 30s. a week, whichever be less.                      Other  Dependants.     9. Other dependants  include, relatives  (formerly  known as  Class A) and unmarried wives (Class B).  The maximum  pension  under the new warrant is 5s.  for Class A, and  10s., &apos;with children&apos;s allowances,  for  Class B.  The pension in the : case of Class A dependants.is only payable if the. dependant is wholly  or  partially  incapable of self support and is in pecuniary  need.     In  cases  of exceptional hardship  application  may be made on Form P. 2 (revised) for a supplementary allowance where the  pension awarded is  less than  the pre-war  de-&quot; pendence.    Such  allowance  when  added  to   the State . pension, earnings  or earning  capacity, and other  income,; must not ordinarily exceed  two-thirds of the pre-war depen-&apos; dence, earnings and other income, or a sum of 20s. a week, whichever  be less.   In  very exceptional cases, however,  the Statutory Committee will be prepared to consider an applica-&apos; tion for a supplementary-allowance to make up-the State pension to a Class A dependant to  the amount of  the  pre-: war dependence where  the  latter is., only slightly in excess--of the maximum State pension payable, notwithstanding that the proportion of two-thirds is thereby exceeded.   .......  .  - .....     Post War Dependants.    10. Under Article 21 .(2) of the Royal Warrant the parents of a sailor  or soldier, who, at the commencement of.the  war was an apprentice,or a.student, may receive an.allowance of&apos; not exceeding&apos;  15s..-a, week  if wholly or partly incapable, of self support from.infirmity  or age.  Under  Article 21 (4). of the Warrant a pension,-  not  exceeding 15s. a week, may also be granted to the mother of  a sailor or soldier who, by reason: -of the death of the father, of the sailor or soldier during the- war)--becomes  at-.;any- time:.wholly  or partly incapable&quot;&quot;of Support from infirmity or age.                    &quot;
  These provisions will meet the great majority of claimson the ground of &quot; post war &quot; dependence.  Other cases mayarise, however, where,  owing to a serious diminution in theearning capacity of a dependant or owing to the death or lossof earning capacity of the principal contributor  other  thanthe father, a larger contribution would have  been necessaryand  probably forthcoming from the sailor or soldier had  helived.  In such circumstances the Statutory Committee will beprepared to  consider.an application  on Form P. 2 (Revised)for a supplementary allowance.  No such application will  beentertained, however, unless it can be shown that the deceasedsailor or soldier, had he lived, would have been in a positionto increase the contribution which he had made previously tothe support of the dependant.  Any increase in wages due tothe war conditions  must  be disregarded in considering theability of the-sailor, or soldier to increase, his contribution.A full report on these points should be forwarded with theform of  application.         .   .              (c)  Disabled Sailors and Soldiers.  ll. Owing to the generous provisions of the Royal Warrantwith regard to disabled sailors and soldiers it is doubtful if anycases will arise which cannot adequately be dealt  withthere-under either by means of an alternative pension or by allow-ances for treatment  or  training.  . It  is  not,   therefore,anticipated  that  Supplementary Allowances  will be neededfor disabled  men, but it will be open to Local Committees tosubmit for  special consideration any case of  an  exceptionalnature which, in  their opinion, can properly  be  dealt.withunder the Regulation. &apos;    *  .&apos;.  ,  i               SPECIAL  ALLOWANCES.   .   12. Under the Royal Warrant a pension will be granted toa disabled man or to a widow or dependant of a man who hasfallen in the war where it is certified that the man&apos;s disablementor death was  attributable to  or aggravated by war service.Where&apos;the degree of disablement is assessed at less than  20per  cent, or where the incapacity  or  death is  neither attri-hutable  to nor aggravated by service^ a gratuity or temporaryallowance may be  granted  to a disabled man  or,  in thecase  of a widow,  a temporary pension of 15s.  for the dura-tiori  of  the war  and  for twelve  months afterwards.   TheWarrant&apos; purports&quot; therefore to deal,  either  by the  grantof pension or gratuity,  with all cases&apos;in which there is a Stateobligation.   There should, therefore, be few  cases in whichassistance&quot; will: be: required or can  be granted under the newRegulation.   ;It -is  possible,  hoWever,! that individual casesof hardship will arise which are not&apos;met by the Royal Warrant
s or are the subject of appeal and where there are good ground; for  considering  that  a Special Allowance of a temporary character should be granted to a disabled man,  widow  or dependant.    13.  The  new  Regulation relating to  Special Allowances follows Sub-Section (2) of Regulation 27 of the original Part I Regulations  both  as regards the  amounts payable and the conditions on which the allowances may be granted.  Sub-Section (1) of Regulation 27, providing for  the continuance  of Special Separation Allowances granted under Part II of the Regula- tions has now become unnecessary.  The original  provision in Sub-Section  (2) with regard to dependants has, however, beer. extended to  include cases of &quot; post war &quot; dependence.    Applications for Special Allowances should be made on the forms previously prescribed for Special  (Temporary)  Allow- ances, i.e., Form P. 5 for widows, Form P. 6 for dependants or for a child, and  Form D. 2  for a disabled man.    Earnings or earning capacity and any other income  will  be taken into account in  determining  the amount  of any  special allowance and  should be assessed in  accordance  with the Instructions  to the original Regulations  (Part I).    The most important provision of this Regulation  is that  no case  shall be considered  unless the death or disablement  of the  sailor or soldier was due to circumstances arising from service during the present war.                        (a)  Widows.    14.  For the present the  only cases in which  applications for Special Allowances for widows can be considered will  be those in which a pension has been refused but where there is evidence that the .man&apos;s death  was due  to  circumstances arising  from  service during the war.  No such application will. be entertained if the  refusal of the Minister of  Pensions  to-grant a pension  was due to  the  unsatisfactory  service of the sailor or soldier or to.the unworthiness of the applicant. Full. particulars of the circumstances in which the man  met with.his death must be forwarded with,the application.  ..    The maximum allowance which can be granted to a  widow-under the regulation is  10s., together with  allowances  for children  at  the . rates, specified in the Royal Warrant (i.e.,.5s. for  the first child,  4s. 2d. for. a second- child, 3s. 4d. for a third child, and  2s. -6d. for each child after the third). The allowances for children will only be payable up to the  age  of.16.       ,   -          .   -           ..   -     -   ... .-.&apos;   The  above scale is the maximum which can be granted:.in  any  case,  In- making -their., recommendation as to the^amount Of agraiit in&quot; any, particular case the Local Committee
must have regard to the  pre-war earnings  of the  husband,and  should, not ordinarily recommend an  allowance which,together with any other source of income, would exceed two-diirds  of the pre-war income of  the household.                      (b) Dependants.   15. The great  majority of  cases  in which a pension orallowance can properly be granted to a dependant will becovered by the wide provisions of the Royal Warrant.  Indi-vidual cases  of special hardship  which cannot be dealt withby the Minister of Pensions,  but which appear to be eligibleunder  this regulation, should be submitted to the StatutoryCommittee for consideration.  In submitting an applicationfor a special allowance on grounds of &quot; post-war &quot; dependencethe  Statutory Committee  must  be satisfied that, owing tothe  circumstances indicated in Regulation 9  (a) of Part IIthere has been a change in the financial position of the family,in consequence of which the parent or other relative wouldhave become  dependent upon  the sailor or soldier.  It  willalso  be  necessary to  show  that the sailor  or  soldier  hadlie lived, would have been in a position to contribute to thedependanfs support.  Full particulars on this point, supportedby  a  certified statement  as to  pre-war - or pre-enlistmentearnings,  must  be  forwarded  with the  application.   Themaximum Special Allowance which can be  granted  to  a de-pendant is 10s.  a week  provided. that such allowance shallnot exceed the actual pre-war dependence or, in cases of post-war  dependence,  the estimated amount which the  sailor orsoldier could  and probably would have contributed.                     (c)  Disabled Men.   16.  Applications  for special allowances  to  disabled  mencan only be made in cases  where a pension has been refused.Ordinarily  it must be assumed that if a gratuity has beenawarded, the man is  not eligible for a special allowance,as his  disability will either be  so slight that the gratuity isadequate recompense,  or it  will  not  have  been caused oraggravated by war  service.  If  an application  is made inrespect of a  man  who has been awarded a gratuity, it willtherefore be  necessary  to  produce  evidence to  show  that,notwithstanding the gratuity, in the exceptional circumstancesof the  case further assistance is  necessary.  &quot;Tf an application is made in a case where no pension orgratuity has been granted, full particulars should be furnishedas to the circumstances in which the man  became  disabledand the reason for the refusal of a pension or gratuity shouldbe stated.
   The maximum allowance is 20s. a week if separation allow-ance had been issued to a wife  or dependant together withallowances for children as in para. 14 above, or 10s.  a weekif  no  separation  allowance  had  been issued.   In no case,however,  will an allowance be granted which, together withthe man&apos;s earnings or  earning  capacity and other  incomewill exceed his pre-war earnings and other income.   Where a gratuity lias been awarded, the manner in whichthe income value shall be taken into account, instead of beingdetermined in accordance with the definition of income valuecontained in the original Regulations  (Part I), will be detcr-mined  by the Statutory Committee  after  reference  to  theMinister of Pensions in order to ascertain the basis on whichthe gratuity was calculated. Review of Supplementary Allowances and Special  Allowances.   17.  Under the Regulations no supplementary  allowanceor special allowance will be granted for a longer period thansix months at a time.   Shortly before the  expiration of theperiod  of  the award the  Local Committee will be required tofurnish a further report on the case, and to notify any altera-tions in the circumstances of the recipient.18th June, 1917.

As the Local Committee are aware it has been found necessary as regards otherboarded-out children that there should be periodical inspection  of the homes inwhich the children are placed, so that it may be ascertained whether in fact thechildren are receiving proper care and  attention from their foster parents.  It mayultimately be necessary for the Pensions Minister to appoint boarding-out inspectors,but it is  hoped that, at any rate  for the present, while numbers are  small it  willbe possible  for Local  Committees to  arrange that some one of their  members orvisitors shall supervise the arrangements made  for  these motherless children  andassist the Minister in seeing that the allotted allowance is properly administeredfor their welfare.    The  Statutory Committee would be glad to  know whether any lady membersof the Local Committee, or  any lady visitors appointed by the Local Committee,would be willing to undertake the responsibility  of supervising motherless childrenof sailors and soldiers boarded out in the area.                                   I am, Sir,                                        Your  obedient Servant,                                                  E. A. STANTON.

Present Sir A. Boscawen, Mr, Cyril    Jackson, and Hon, A* Stanley with Sir John Collie, Dr. C.H*    Bond,  Dr.  Fox-Symons, Dr. Hartley and Sir H. Haward.   Mr.    Hore&apos;was also present,1,  The Minutes of the last meeting were taken as read,    paraplegics,  Dr. Fox-Symons \read a statement showing the   -numbers of cases admitted to Institutions, the numbers still    under treatment and the; numbers discharged, of which he    promised to furnish an abstract *   The proposed Institution    at Leicester was considered; it was decided to recommend that    the Mayor  of Leicester and his chief supporters should be asked    to come up and consult the Ministry as to the scheme.    Epileptics.   Mr. Figgis, the archi ecjt was present with the    plans  of the proposed new buildings viz, 3 villas with 30    beds in each, each being estimated to cofet  6000*   lMr.Hall,    the architect of ,the Red Cross Society, thought it an    admirable  scheme, but anticipated that the cos$ all told would    be  30,000p   Dr. Bond thought that the plan was very good    and would  be a most valuable addition^   It was agreed that    Mr. Stanley should go into the estimates and report at a    subsequent meeting,,              Jt was reported that wprk had been begun on the    Temporary  building at Lingfield, it was estimated that the    cost would bo  2450a    Chalfont - a letter from Mr. Gaskell as to tho purchase of    furniture  and the increased cost thereof was read.    Mr.    Jackson undertook to inquire what had been done and what the    total cost was, and to communicate with Mr. Stanley. 4. The question of pocket-money for men in Institutions was    further considered.   Dr. Bond read a letter which he had    addressed to tho Superintendents of Chalfont, Lingfield and                                                        ilaghull,
   Maghull, together with the replies received from the two   former; both expressed the opinion that 2/6 should be the   maximuajj.   Dr. Bond put in a memorandum which he had prepared.   Sir John Collie also thought that 5/- would be too much in the   case of Neurasthenics.   It was recognised that in detail the   matter was one for the Ministry, but a discussion of the   principle as affecting all four classes of Institutions dealt   with by the Committee was felt to be advantageous.   Having   regard to the fact that the Ministry had to deal with other   Institutions it appeared desirable that any regulations should   fix some sum of money as the normal rate, and it was therefore   agreed to recommend a regulation that the sum allowed per week   should be 2/6 or such other sum as the Minister of Pensions   approved on the advice of the Superintendent of the Institution.5* The Treasury decision on allowances in incurable  cases was   discussed :*   It was agreed that it would be desirable to have   a Conference on this subject and on the working of Article 6   of the Warrant, to which some of those now. present should be   invited.6. Dr. Bond called attention to the need for obtaining information   as to the numbers of Epileptics throughout the Country.   After   some discussion it was agreed that the best course would be ter   ask the Joint Area Disablement Committees to collect   information relating to the four classes of Neurasthenics,   Epileptics, Paraplegics and Tuberculosis.   Sir A. Boscawen   agreed to discuss it with Mr. Hore.7. Neurasthenics.   Mr. Stanley mentioned the offer of a house   near Tonbridge by Mr. Seligman; it was agreed that there was   no present need.   A house near London was required: fir.   Stanley thought there was a possible house at Ham Common near   Richmond; Sir J. Collie had seen Kent House at West Ealing   which might do.             Sir Robert Foxfs letter of 26th June suggesting                                                       possible
    possible houses near Leeds was read,    Sir J,  Collie agreed    to visit the houses and report. 8. The Hostel at Bath.  Mr, Radcliffe,  the organizer for West    of England, was present on behalf of the Bath Committee.  The    authorities of the Springs and the Local Committee were    satisfied that a Hostel was indispensable to their scheme    and was preferable to lodgings.   The matter was outside  the    scope of the Committee, but, it was  explained that if the    men were certified as requiring Treatment they would get  the    benefit of Article 6 of the Warrant;  the body responsible    for the Hostel would have to make their own arrangements  with    the men.   It was agreed to recommend that an explanatory    letter should be written from the Ministry.   As regards    capital expenditure Mr. Stanley said that the  Red Cross    Society wo^Ld consider an application for assistance.9.  Tuberculosis.  Dr. Hartley had nothing further to report  as    to Papworth Hall.-   The difficulty of getting  cases into  the    pavilions of the Metropolitan Asylums Board continued, and    he would be glad if they could be empowered to send the cases    in if no reply was received from the Insurance Committee    within 2 days.   Mr. Hore explained the arrangements that    had been made with the Insurance Commissioners, which It  was    hoped would meet the difficulty.   The. M,A,B.  had the whole    150 beds ready; this seemed premature, as there were only 6    cases waiting besides the 6 already in.   It was thought  that    2 pavilions would be sufficient for  the present.
                      APPENDIX V.                            Xw               Memorandum of Interview                          -on      Arrangements for Treatment of Tuberculosis.          Sir Robert Morant, Dr. Smith-VJhittaker and Mr.Vivian of the National Insurance Commission called thismorning to discuss with Sir Matthew Nathan, Mr. Flynn andMr. Hore arrangements for the treatment of tuberculosis.    2.    The difficulty which had arisen in London betweenthe London Insurance Committee and the London PensionsCommittee was in the view of the Insurance Commissionerslargely political, and they suggested that the London Committeehad in fact done a good deal more towards providing treatmentfor discharged tuberculosuc men than they professed.    3,    The Commissioners stated that they had obtained theconsent of the Treasury to extend the  10 priority grant toall cases arising within three months after discharge andthis arrangement would also cover all cases in which tuber*-culosis was present at the time.of discharge although thedisease was not the cause of the man&apos;8 discharge.    4.    A point was put to them on behalf of the Ministrythat apart from incurable eases, treatment was not being&quot;promptly given in all cases needing residential treatment whicharoae after discharge, and that there were in certain cases longwaiting lists owing, to the deficiency of accommodationavailable t6 Insurance Committees and Sir Matthew Nathansuggested that an extension of the  10 grant for a substantialperiod, say two years, might be made if this was necessaryin order to guarantee the man receiving treatment when heneeded it.      To this the Insurance/Commissioners repliedthat in their view the extension of the grant to this lengthwas unnecessary;  that the extension which they had alreadysecured for the first three months after discharge would offer a                                                substantial
substantial inducement to Local Insurance Committees to searchout the man and to provide him with treatment, and that thisinducement might be removed if the Committees knew thatthey would receive the grant whenever the case requiredtreatment.     It was, h6wever, pointed out on behalf of theMinistry, that though this might be true in regard to futurecases coming under these arrangements it would not apply tothe large number of men discharged as tuberculous since thecommencement of the war and in the end it was agreed      (a)  that the Ministry should extend the  10 grant toall cases which in the opinion of the Tuberculosis Officerneeded institutional treatment up to the 30th June, 1917,v/hich were not already covered by the existing priority grantand      (b)  that the existing priority grant as already extendedby the Treasury should be further extended to six monthsafter discharge at the coot of the Ministry.       5.  With regard to the machinery by v/hich it shouldbe secured that any case of tuberculosis receivedat once thetreatment considered necessary in the circumstances by theTuberculosis Officer it was, after some discussion, agreedthat the Local Far Pensions Committee should be instructedto communicate with regard to such cases with the InsuranceCommissioners instead of the Insurance Committee.   TheInsurance Commissioners would then undertake to communicatewith the Local Insurance Committee and require the treatmentto oe given.       6.   As regards the advanced cases It was agreed thatprovision for these cases had not hitherto been generallymade by Insurance Committees.    It was offered on behalfof the Ministry that the Ministry should pay the entirecost of maintenance of incurable cases provided a                                                     formula
formula could be devised by which the TubermLicrsi: s&apos; Of f ic-er- - o oulddetermine satisfactorily which were and which were not to be  sodealt with.  .              -     .       7.   As to the machinery by which incurable cases wereto receive treatment it was agreed that the report of theTuberculosis Officer should be sent to the Ministry in anycase which, in his opinion, the disease was incurable and oughtto have residential treatment.     If thereupon the Ministryare able to arrange for the Man&apos;s treatment in an institutionprovided by the Institutional Committee they would do so, if                                             Ministry&apos;gotherwise; the Insurance Committee would ab the/request makethe arrangements for admission.       8.  With regard to the representations from the V&apos;elshInsurance Commission it was pointed cut by the Commissionersthat the difficulty arose from the fact that the NationalAssociation and County Borough Councils in Wales had as itwere pooled their finances so that any increase in expenditurenecessarily Involved, the levy of an extra rate by the Councils.It was agreed that the Ministry could not offer any specialterms to Hales which would not also affect the position in otherparts of the Kingdom, but that the arrangements arrived at atthis interview with the English Commission should be communi-cated to the Welsh Commission, and further that if as regards.incurable cases the National Association desired to set aside..any part of their accommodation for such cases an arrangementmight be made by which the Ministry undertook to make asubvention, which might take the form of a small payment forunoccupied beds.     Sir Robert Morant undertook to suggest areply to the r:elsh Commission.  :

Arrangements have been made under Article1 6 of the Royal Warrant for the Pensions of soldiers and sailors by which every soldier and sailor who is disabled by reason of mental unfitness certified to&quot;be due to or aggravated by war. service during the present War, and who; on the  1st of July, -1917, is a patient in a County or Borough Lunatic Asylum, or who, subsequent to that date, may be admitted as a patient into any such Institution, is entitled to be placed on the list of private patients and treated     &quot; Service Patient.&quot;     2.  The Treasury, in addition,: have  agreed,  at  the instance of the Minister of Pensions, to extend the. privileges of &quot; Service Patients &quot; to non-pensionable cases- (i.e., cases in which the malady was. not due to or aggravated by Military or Naval Service) provided that the  arrangement shall not extend beyond the period of the War and for twelve months afterwards, nor to men who before; enlistment had been treated in Asylums.  The records of  the Asylum to which a non-pensionable soldier or sailor .is admitted should be examined to see if the latter condition is fulfilled in so far as that Asylum is concerned.     3.  No soldier or sailor admitted, to an Asylum is to be placed on the &quot; Service Patient &quot; list until notice has been received from, the Minister of Pensions that, he is to be classed as a &quot; Service Patient.&quot;     4. When a discharged soldier is admitted under section 91 of the Army Act, or a discharged sailor under section 3 of the Naval Enlistment Act, 1884 (adapting to sailors the provisions of  section 91 of the Army Act), enquiry should at once be made of the  Minister of Pensions, Pension Issue Office, Baker Street, London, W. 1, whether such ex-soldier or ex-sailor is to be treated as a &quot; Service Patient.&quot;     In the case of. a male patient admitted on a summary reception order, whenever the admission papers contain any statements to suggest that the man has been serving as&quot; a soldier or sailor during the War, or any  information to this effect is forthcoming from the  Eelieving Officer,  or other person escorting the patient, or otherwise, similar  enquiry should also be made.     In each instance the enquiry should be accompanied by a short statement of the facts that have been elicited and the  reasons for thinking that the patient has been serving in either branch of His Majesty5s  Forces and may or should be entitled to be treated as a  &quot; Service Patient,&quot; together with the opinion in writing of the Medical Superintendent on the case.     It is desirable that any information  so obtained either for or against the sup- position that the man is entitled to be  treated as a &quot; Service Patient&quot; should be promptly and prominently entered in the case book. &apos;  If no such information is obtainable at the  time of admission  the Medical  Superintendent should, as subse- quent opportunities arise, endeavour to clear up the position;     5. Evidence whenever obtained  tending to show that a man has served in theArmy or Navy during the present war should be at once communicated to the Pension Issue Office, with the object  of ascertaining whether the man is entitled to be treated as a .&quot; Service Patient.&quot;                       .         &apos;     6.  So soon as information has  been  received from the Minister of Pensions Pension Issue Office, that  a man is  to be so treated, the Medical Superintendent should, at once classify him  as a &quot;Service Patient&quot; and notify  the Local War Pensions&apos; Committee of the locality where the man&apos;s home is situate, the Pension Issue Office,  and the Board  of Control.that this has  been done.    7. The Medical Superintendent  should use his best endeavours to get placed onthe &quot;Service Patient&quot;, list  all ex-soldiers and ex-sailors in his Asylum who in his opinion are entitled to be so classed.

     8.   From the date of the notice authorizing classification as a &quot; Service Patient &quot; the Minister of Pensions will become responsible for all payments on behalf of the man under the scheme.  Any formal agreement to this effect has been decided to be unnecessary.     9.   Accounts for the maintenance of &quot; Service Patients &quot;should be presented quarterly to the Pension Issue Office as soon as practicabler after the 30th June, 80th September, 31st December  and  31st  March.    The accounts should-include and indicate separately :                           *     -  (a)  the cost of maintenance calculated at the current weekly pauper rate.      &apos; (b)  the additional 3s. 9d. per week per patient payable&apos;to the Committee under              the terms of the scheme;       &apos;   &apos;       (c).the special grant up to 2s. 6d. per  week per patient for extra&apos; comforts              whenever such grant is made;                       -.;      (d)  the cost of reasonable  travelling  expenses incurred&apos; under Instruction 14.       (e)  funeral expenses of a patient dying in the Institution (see Instruction15).     10.  Clothing. It has been deemed advisable to abandon the proposal,., madewhen&apos;the scheme was initiated, that &quot; Service Patients &quot; should be provided with asemi-military uniform.  Accordingly, in lieu thereof, each Visiting Committee will supply their &quot; Service Patients &quot; with suitable private clothing, the cost of.-which,,so far as it is not met by the charge  for clothing included in the current weekly pauper&quot;rate,  should,  together  with  the  cost  of the  badge  mentioned in the next  para- graph, be  defrayed out of the additional 3s. 9d. (see instruction 9 -(&amp;))  which the Committee will  receive; any balance on this sum will be placed to the credit of the Building and Eepairs Fund account.            .,                  .-     It is intended that a badge of an approved pattern shall be worn by each&quot; Service Patient&quot; on his  jacket, and that there should be one distinctive badge for ex-soldiers and one for ex-sailors.  Particulars of these  badges and information as  to their cost and where  they can be.obtained will be furnished by the  Board of Control so soon as the badges have received  the respective approval of the War Office and the Admiralty.          ...                               &apos;   &apos;    -     Ordinarily, the jackets, waistcoats, trousers  and overcoats intended for pauper patients must not.be  worn by &quot; Service Patients,&quot; but it will be left entirely to the Medical Superintendent to determine what  elothing should be worn (a) by a patient when employed&apos;on the farm or gardens, or in other work; (b) by a sick patient; and (c) by  a patient whose habits are faulty or destructive.     11.  The provisions of section 55 of the Lunacy Act, 1890, with regard to the sending  of patients &quot; on trial,&quot; will apply  to the case  of a  &quot; Service Patient,&quot; but unless the  circumstances are exceptional, the period of trial should not extend beyond one month.     When a patient  is absent &quot; on trial&quot; the  Visiting Committee will continue to- charge for him as though he were in the Asylum; but they will hand over, in fort- nightly instalments, either to the patient himself, or to his friends, whichever. the Committee think better, for his maintenance while on trial,  a sum of money equiva-&apos; lent to  the amount received  by them from  the Minister of Pensions for  his main- tenance, plus  the special grant of 2s. 6d.  The additional 3s. 9d. during the period of trial will still be credited  to the Building and Repairs Fund account.     If the Visiting Committee decide to allow a  &quot; Service Patient&quot; to be absent on trial for a longer period than one month and desire to obtain a continuation, of the monetary  allowance for him as a &quot; Service Patient,&quot; the consent  of the Board of Control to such extended period must be obtained.     12.  The Visiting Committee will have the power to . discharge  a :l Service Patient&quot; under the provisions of section 77 (1) (2).     As &quot;Service Patients &quot; will be on the legal footing of private patients,  the pro- visions of the Lunacy Acts as to private patients will be applicable to them, one of the most important matters in connection with which is the power to discharge a patient from an Asylum,  which is dealt  with under sections 72 and 74.  In the case-of  a &quot;  Service Patient&quot; there will ordinarily be no petitioner,  and it is probable  that occasional  instances will occur in which the friends  desire, to take the patient out of the Asylum and to look after him at home, though he has not recovered.  If the Medical Superintendent advises or approves this course, no  difficulty will &quot;arise, but
 they will sometimes  be anxious to . discharge the patient against the advice of the Superintendent that such a course is likely to be prejudicial to him.  The Super- intendent (if he is unable to give the  barring certificate under section 74) cannot refuse to obey  the. direction of  the  friends to  discharge;  but he is  authorised to - inform them that he (the Superintendent) is deemed by the Minister of Pensions to be the person certifying that the man requires medical treatment in  an Asylum: (see Article  6 of the Royal Warrant for the Pensions of soldiers and sailors and the definition of &quot; Certified&quot; in Article 24 (8)), and that, if they insist on his ^discharge, the chance  of  the patient being.again received as a  &quot; Service Patient&quot; into the  . Asylum will be jeopardised,  and  that, in addition, he may possibly lose a part of his pension as provided by Article 4.  -   -  .13.  Subject to Instructions 2 and 12,. the Medical Superintendent, of his own accord can,  on the re-admission of a  patient who has previously been on the footing of a &quot; Service Patient,&quot; at once re-classify him as a &quot; Service Patient.&quot;      A &quot;Service Patient&quot; whose discharge has been insisted upon by friends con- trary to the advice of the Medical Superintendent, if re-admitted, cannot be again classified as a &quot;Service Patient&quot; without reference to the Minister of Pensions.      14.  The Minister hopes that too much insistence will not  be laid upon per- manently retaining a &quot; Service Patient&quot; in the Asylum to which he would have gone; if he were a pauper, and wThich may be in quite a different part of the country to that in which his wife, family or friends are living.  The main object of the scheme is to secure the happiness and contentment of the patient and to consult the con- venience of  his friends.  A Visiting Committee will have power to  arrange with another Committee for transference of  a case where there is good reason for this to be done, and the Board of Control will  be prepared to give facilities for the removal of such cases.  Probably, in the long  run. such transfers would fall fairly equally on all Visiting; Committees.      The reasonable travelling expenses incurred by a Visiting Committee in con- nection with such transfers will be defrayed by the Minister of Pensions.      15.  The burial expenses of &quot; Service Patients -&quot; dying in the  Asylum will be defrayed, up to an amount not exceeding   4, by the Minister of Pensions.  If the friends of a patient wish to remove  the body for burial, a sum not exceeding this amount may be given to them for this  purpose, which will be refunded by the Minister of Pensions.      16.   The Minister of Pensions  will leave the following additional matters to be determined  by the  Visiting  Committee on the advice of their. Medical Super- intendent:         (a) which  patients are capable of appreciating and benefiting by the special              grant up to 2s. 6d.; upon what additional comforts the money should be              spent; and whether the patient may properly be entrusted with spend-  &apos;              ing the money himself;        (&amp;) the fitness of a patient for being sent &quot; on trial &quot; or for discharge.      17.   On the discharge  of a &quot;Service Patient&quot;  notice should be  sent to the  &apos; Pension Issue. Office and the Local War Pensions Committee of the man:s proposed place of residence in order that the  former may make any necessary change in the amount of payments to the man and  to  his wife and family, and that the Local War Pensions Committee may keep an eye on him.,      18.-  The Pension Issue Office should also, be  informed as speedily as possible of the removal and admission of cases  transferred under Instruction  14; of the re- admission of cases re-classified as &apos;.&apos; Service Patients &quot;  under Instruction 13; and of  ... the death of all &quot; Service Patients.&quot; ;                                 (Signed) &apos;   E.  MARRIOTT  COOKE,    &apos;  &apos;   &apos;,                                                         Chairman.
APPENDIX. VII-129LEuORAiTDuIi AS.&apos; TO TRAIIUi!G &apos; ACTIVITIES OF ; TEi IIIITISTRY    . OF PE3SI0NS AW THE STATUTORY OOiiiilTTEE.              The provision of training for discliargedi disabled sailors and soldiers has hitherto been one of the duties of the Statutory Committee who: have formed a separate section for that purpose of which Ur. J. S. HIcholson of.the.Ministry of Labour is Chairman. .  The Statutory Committee have established 304 Local Committees which cover the whole of the United Kingdom and parts of Ireland.   These Committees-have, in relation to training, two functions,              (a) They can submit a general scheme of training                     for their locality, or              (b) They can submit proposals for training                    individual men to the Statutory Committee.               It has been the policy of the Statutory Committee to encourage Local Committees- as far as possible to proceed by wgcy of schemes  and to apply for sanction in individual cases only in the case of  men for whom training of a special nature is proposed.   The number of men for whom sanction for individual graining has been ;;:iven is therefore comparatively small.              In order to satisfy themselves that the training  - ffhen given will be permanently beneficial to  the man and will not interfere unduly with any trade or industry,  the Statutory Committee have  been in communication with the Board of Education, the Board of Agriculture and other Corernment Departments on the.one hand, and on the other hand with the Trades Advisory Committees recently constituted by the ministry of Labour in conjunction with the Statutory Committee to advise as to the training of disabled men and their subsequent employment in the trades for which each such. C-oVu:iltte&quot;e  is  responsible.    By these  means  they have been able to  savfcLsfy themselves-that  the  training  is  of  an  adequate nature,  and that it will  receive.the. active support  of  the  various                                               Associations
Associations of &quot;Employers-  and &quot;Sork^peoplo in  the differenttrades.   In the case of those trades, in which no Trade Advis^rtryCommittee has been established, the Statutory Committee havebeen ,in constant communication with the Ministry of Labour  andwith persons well acquainted with the position and prospects ofeach trade.;.              V/hen a Local Pensions Committee have satisfiedthemselves that any considerable number of men are likely torequire training in certain trades in their district, it is theduty of that Committee to make arrangements with Local, technicalor other institutes, e,g.Polytechnics, or with employers oflabour-for the training of men in specified industries.   Theyagree as t$ the subjects to be taught; length of course, feespayable, and the number of men who can be accommodated in theinstitute or firm.   When such a scheme has been considered andapproved by the Statutory Committee the Local  Committee cansend any number of men within the limits specified in the schemeto undergo training in accordance with the scheme without furtherreference to the Statutory Committee.   Up to the present 29L$c  Committees have submitted schemes for training of thisnature which have been approved.   11 Schemes are underconsideration and in 8 cases supplemsntary schemes have beensubmitted which have not yet been approved.   Appendix A is a listof Local  Committees and the subjects in which they haveauthority to train men.    Appendix B is a corresponding list ofschemes under consid eration including supplewsntary schemes.             Where the number of men who are likely to requiretuition in any industry is small, the Local Committees, insteadof submitting a scheme, d eal with them as individual cases.The Local Committee having satisfied -themselves that the man iseligible for training decide for what  industry he should betrained, and themselves  forward.recommendations to the StatutoryCommittee, who, if satisfied that the proposed training islikely leisure a permanent means of livelihood to the man whom
it is proposed to train, and that it will be adequate, andthat the fees to be charged are reasonable sanction theproposal.   Appendix C gives a statement of the number of menfor whose training individual sanction has been given, and alist of the trades in which they are being trained.         .    It is the duty of the Local Committees to furnishthe Statutory Committee with returns both of the men undergoingtraining aid of the result of training when completed, butowing to the pressure of work, many Local Committees have nothitherto been able to. make these returns in as complete a formas could be desired, and it is therefore impossible to statewhat number of men have, been trained already *   Appendix Dshows the number of men trained In institutions in London downto the end of February, and may be taken as some indication ofthe work already done in London.   It is, however, anunfortunate fact that owing to the temptation of, higher wages,a great many men have failed to avail themselves of theopportunities for training offered to them, and have preferredto take up work either connected with the war or of a blindalley nature which is highly paid at the present moment.             It has been found that  the areas of LocalCommittees are too small for a sufficient variety of trainingto be given in each of them.   To obtain sufficiently largeclasses for proper teaching under the best teachers availableover a wider district and to make the best use of institutionsof both town and country, it has been decided to form JointCommittees each of which will Include several counties.These Oommittees will exercise the powers delegated to them bythe Local Committees in their area,  and will act as clearinghouses for their areas.   Appendix E is a list of theseCommittees.             It is hoped that by the foregoing means, everyman while remaining as far as possible in his own locality, will

Many menareablevery readily at the present time  to obtain employment ofone kind or another, but such employment may, owing.totheir physical condition be actually detrimental.to-theirpermanent health.  Others may  drift into, occupations inwhich their employment may only, be temporary, whereasif they  had  received training  for a skilled occupationthey would have the prospect of permanent employment.It is vitally important both in the  man&apos;s interest and; inthat of the nation that any. case which needs.&apos;either treat-ment or training should be taken in hand at once.  LocalCommittees will  not have fulfilled  their duty by dealingonly with the men who happen  to present themselves ;tothem for assistance ; they must see that they have  infpr-ination as to the condition of all  discharged,pensipners.intheir areas, and. make a point&apos;of getting in touch with them irectly they are discharged.     .   .

Amendment) Act, 1917, recently  passed, empowers&apos; the  Insurance Commissioners to  extend this provision, to  invalided  sailors and  soldiers who for any  reasosxare  uninsured upon  discharge.  Upon completion, therefore,  of the arrangements now being made  by the  Commis--  sioners, all invalided sailors and soldiers, whether, insured  or notrexcepting only those uninsured men whose income  exceeds   160 per  annum,  will  be entitled  under  the.  Insurance Acts to free  medical,,attendance,&apos; from&quot;a general  practitioner and to the  necessary supply of medicines, &amp;c.  Negotiations are in progress for the extension of medical.  benefit to discharged disabled men in Ireland.   Moreover, special machinery is being, instituted, by the  Commissioners in  co-operation&apos; with the Ministry of  Pensions, whereby,  prior  to a man&apos;s  discharge,&apos;the  In-  surance Committee for the area  in which he  proposes to  live  will, be automatically  notified of  his  impending.  discharge, and thus enabled to take special steps to put him  in. the, way of obtaining the treatment available for him.;i....

Before they can provide special,treatment of any kind, whether the case is one that appears only to need oonvales- c.dnt treatment or is a  serious surgical  case, the Local Committee must be satisfied on medical evidence as to the nature of the  mah&apos;s incapacity, its-connection with, his disablement, the! kind  of treatment necessary and, so far as possible, the period of treatment required.&apos;.

The white card Army Form W. 3555, which is already ihevery cage sent to the Local Committee of.the mah&apos;s place Of residence has recently, by an Army Council Instruction No. issued at the instance of  the  Minister of  Pensions, been extended so as to give the Committee a certificate in the form  required by Instruction ..  It will be  the  duty of the Committee to act. immediately on  receipt of this and to use their, utmost endeavour to induce the man to accept the treatment  pre-cribed.     .........  .          ;&apos;   (b)  Cases arising after&quot;discharge. -Many of these cases will automatically come-under medical review  when at the end of the period, of a conditional pension&apos; they come before a Medical Board.  Where the Board finds that a man needs-treatment they  will certify accordingly, and: the Local.Committee will be notified by the Ministry.   The Local Committee  will, however- find many cases needing treatment  in  the interval between one  official medical, examination.and another, or among men who have been awarded a final, pension, and. for these cases the LocalCommittee must obtain medical, examination and- theappropriate treatment.  In order, to secure, that, as far aspossible every case, is referred at once to the suitable insti-tution where  the man may  be medically or  surgicallytreated; it is necessary that not only should.the variousinstitutions, military; and civil, be classified but&apos; that thecases themselves should be sorted..

 --Xhich- they; .-aot&apos;.. will be .notified&apos; from time to. time to the. Local  Committee.  Pending their &quot;appointment the Local-. Committee  -should obtain certificates ih: accordance with- their  present practice.   Where  a I Medical  Referee  has been appointed,  $he normal  procedure will be that :an applicant- for treatment  to. a Local  Committee  or  to a District  or  Sub-Committee  is  referred  at. once to a Medical Referee, whose duty.it will be to satisfy himself in the first  instance that  the. incapacity from . which the man is suffering is, so far as can reasonably be ascertained,. connected  with his disablement.  For this  /purpose  the Medical, Referee should be furnished by  the ^Committee .with a copy .of ,any official; medical: report from  the.. Ministry or otherwise. (e.g.\ Form- 3463) which they ;rhay have..  At  the same time the man should be questioned. on this point  and; it  should: be  remembered in  this connection  that  :by  tbe  Regulations of . the insurance.

 of  Recommendation.(to be  supplied .hy the Local Com-&quot;&apos; mittee) stating the nature of the incapacity-from -which he  finds the man to be suffering and that in his opinion, so  far as he  can judge,  it  is  consequent on the man&apos;s disablement. .  Instruction  allows of   two exceptions to the general rule reqiring  examination of the men  by the Medical Referee  before  treatment  is  given,  namely,  (a) cases requiring immediate and  urgent treatment, and (b) cases in which there is no reasonable doubt as to the institution to which the man should be. sent.   Even in these cases reference by letter or other communication to the Referee for advice as to the case must be made, but the power to deal thus exceptionally with cases  should  be sparingly used.. There will, however,  be  cases, e.g., ofan obvious wound or in jury, or where theunhealed stump of  a limb requires attention, in which the man:can be sent to the proper institution without the  delay that would occur if the man were first required  to be personally examined by the Medical Referee. &apos;-&apos;                    &apos; -&quot;   ;.

Before any arrangements can be made with Institutions the Local Committee will-have; to ascertain (so far  as they have not already  done:so) the several classes of institution available for iheir use.   On this point see Instruction  The Medical Members of  the Local  Committee or of the Disablement Committee, will, it- is hopedj fender aesist- ance in this direction, and particularly imconneetidn with any.communication necessary with the Deputy Director ofMedical Services; in-  regard -to--ihe^classification of: Military ^Hospitals.-&apos; i The -Local&apos; Director-  iri: &quot;-charge of Auxiliary Hospitals in or near the  area  should similarly be  approached.in  regard, to the terms  on which  such hospitals can be used, and the classes of  case for  which they are suitable. ,  itmust.be remembered also  in  this connexion, -that-the Joint  Committee,  if one has been.
 established- embracing the &quot;area of the  Loealw Committee, has as one of its principal duties that of ascertaining the institutional facilities of its area, and the Local Committee should act closely in touch with&apos;the Joint Committee...&apos;   Meri may be sent to Military Hospitals in- the case, of wound  or injury/without  previous   sanction  by  the Minister.  Iiistruction-^also allows the Local&apos; Committee to make arrangements with certain of the larger and fully equipped  civil&apos; hospitals  specified  in that  Instruction-. without previous saiiction by&apos;the Minister, but all arrange- ments proposed with other hospitals of any other kind must be submitted for  approval.  Further Instruction- requires that a ptatement  shall  as  soon as  possible-be submitted by every Local Committee, (except where-they have already submitted such a  statement to.the Statutory Committee) for approval to the Ministry, setting out in detail the hospitals and Ins itutions withv which the Local Committee have made or propose to make arrangements.          What hinds of treatment-can be given.   The cases requiring treatment will be (a) those snffer- ing from wounds  and injuries special to war service for which further treatment in or at  an  institution may be advisable, and which should,  as already  indicated,  be treated wherever  possible, at  a military hospital, because of the special facilities at present  existing in the equip- ment of these institutions  and in the experience of this class of case possessed by the staff attached to them; and (j) medical cases.of disease, mostly not attributable to but aggravated by War Service,&apos;and  for these, while  home treatment such as the panel practitioner under the National Insurance Acts can give is Ordinarily sufficient, specialist. treatment may in  some cases, be necessary.  In these capes the special treatment required should  wherever&apos;, possible be given in or at a civil  hospital,  whether a general or a special hospital unless of course the treatment is no more than the general practitioner would ordinarily t)e required to give.  &apos;&quot;;    &apos;   : &apos;     - &apos;-   : .&apos;v   :   -    .   : Mow  treatment required is to be obtained.

The&apos;  following  paragraphs deal in detail  with thearrangements to&apos; be made for each of the above.elapses.                  Tuberculous Cases. .  The Insurance Commissioners and the Local InsuranceCommittees are primarily responsible for. securing&quot; allnecessary treatment for cases  of tuberculosis whether  ofdischarged men or others, if they are&apos; insured &quot;under theNational Insurance Acts;.  Arrangements will also shortlybe made.! by which treatment will also be provided bythem for.the  few discharged men  who.  for  one reasonor  another were  ,not. insured  during  their  militaryservice.  ....  Where a man is about to be discharged on  account  oftuberculosis and is in need of  institutional, treatment, theInsurance  Commissioners ,are notified,, and  obtain theman&apos;s. admission to.an. institution..  These arrangementsare made centrally&apos;and all  payments in  respect,of theman&apos;s  treatment will be made by the Commissioners,and  the&apos; Ministry&apos;&apos;of.  Pensions.&quot;will  make all  allowances&apos;&apos;to the man&apos; and to his family or dependents during treat&apos;mientattd will notify the&apos;Local Commitfee&apos;accordingly^  ..;
   The  cases which-.,may come to the  knowledge  oiLocal Oommifctees are: those where the man has refusedtreatment on discharge or has left the institution pre-.maturely, or where, sometime.after discharge, his-con-dition. may  grow worse,   Any such&apos; case that may cometo the knowledge :of the Local Committee should be atonce referred to the Insurance Committee.  &apos;-&apos;   Subject to any further instructions oh the matter thatmay be issued, the Local Committee are -not  empoweredto provide treatment in any:case&apos; Of; Tuberculosis exceptWith the sanction of the Ministry of Pensions.- ;:  Arrangements are now being.made ;between the. Insur-ance  Commissioners  and  the   Ministry: of  Pens onswhereby  all cases among discharged soldiers  suffering.from tuberculosis shall receive special attention:   -  .  Difficulty may be experienced in some cases in induc-insr the man to go to an institution.^ He may not realisethat his case requires-treatment, &quot;or if it is a case ofadvanced-tubercalosis; he maybe -inclined to stay at homerather  than.go  to an institution.  The  Local  Committeemust use their utmost persuasion in dealing with&apos;such;cases, pointing out the penalty of reduction of pension ifthe. man refuses the. treatment.  In advanced  and incur-able cases the man should preferably go to an institution,not only for his own treatment, but because of the gravedanger of infection to his family, but hospital accommoda-tion for this class is limited at present, though steps arebeing taken to increase it.   If the Committee&apos;s Medicaladviser recommends such a course, the  Local  Committeemay, if necessary, and with the sanction of the Minister,take an extra room or hire  a  garden shelter for the manto enable him to sleep away from other members of hisfamily, where  the Insurance Committee do not providethis.     -                       Insane.   -&apos;-&apos;.&apos;           -&apos;  -  The institutions, available are the County and  Borough:Lunatic Asylums.

The  Special  Medical Board sits in /London, and  pays periodic visits to. the &quot; .:
 Cambridge, Brighton,  Birmingham, Bristol, Oxford, Vly. mouth, Southsea, Newcastle, Bradford, Leicester, Lincoln and branches have also been set up in Edinburgh, Belfast Dublin.                                   .        -  &apos;   in  some of. the slighter, cases of neurasthenia and functional nerve disease the  Special  Medical  Board recommend the  grant of gratuities instead of pension? with the express  object of encouraging the man&apos;s return to; some form of  occupation and of discouraging the idea of inValidism  which fs so detrimental to complete  re- covery. -  As a rule work  in some form,  at  first  light, encouragement and entire &quot;absence&apos; of in j udicidus sympathy, is  more  helpful in these cases than  commiseration and supplemental  allowances!  Where  gratuities have  been awarded  in cases of this class no additional assistance can be given by the Local Committees under the Royal Warrant or these  instructions,- and  Local Committees are recom- mended not to give assistance out  of other funds at their disposal,  as to  do so will tend  to  frustrate the remedial effect of this method of dealing with&apos;the case.   If a serious case of neurasthenia comes before the Local Committee it should be reported at once to the Ministry of Pensions for reference to the Special Medical Board, and a special examination by the Medical  Board will then, if necessary, be arranged  either in London  or  in one of the above-mentioned towns. ^Arrangements  are in  progress  for providing a few Homes of . Recovery for neurasthenic cases in various parts.,  of  the  country.   One  such  has been opened at Colder&apos;s Green, Hendon,  Middlesex.   Arrangements tor admission will be made by the Ministry after, examination by either the Special Medical Board, or one of its branches. These Homes are not for ordinary  convalescents, but are institutions for the  special treatment of  men  suffering from neurasthenia, shell shock, or other functional nerve disease, with inability to work  and for certain forms of paralysis, tremors,  stammering, or depression.   In  the case of discharged soldiers it  frequently happens  that slow progress has  fostered a gloomy view- as to the  pro- spects  of cure, but in fresh  surroundings these prospects aVe often very good.

As knowledge of this distressing and  disabling maladyis still very far from complete,  its treatment is beset withdifficulty.  Its manifestations  usually commence in earlychildhood or in the early &apos;teens, and if maintained over  aperiod of years the complaint is likely to be very resistiveto treatment.  Fortunately, however, in  many  cases thereis, with or without treatment,an arrest of the symptoms, butunder stresses of various kinds  these may re-appear.   Thishas been the case with a considerable number&apos; of soldiers,but in an appreciable  number  of other  cases the  maladyseems to have first shown itself subsequently to the man&apos;sjoining the army.           .&apos;.                          .

Where a.severe case oO epilepsy &apos;foi which colony treatment is desired comes  before a LOCH Committee, they may  communicate  with the Ministry of Pensions stating full  particulars, and the Ministry.wil then endeavour to  arrange for the mari&apos;s admission.   As soon as the arrangement.is  made the Local Committee will  be notified, and all payments to the Institution and allowances (if any)  due to the man and his  family  wil be made by the Ministry of Pensions.          Paraplegics (total or partial paralysis).   These cases, unless sufficiently recovered to be sent to theii own homes, are on discharge provided with accommoda- tion  in institutions under arrangements made centrally by the Ministry with the help of the  British Red Cros Society, which has both provided  special hospitals foi this  class of case,  and has secured accommodation  in s large number  of other  institutions.  In such cases tin- Ministry  will  be responsible  for all payments - to the institution and for  allowances to the man and his family    When a case  comes  to the  knowledge of the Local Committee some time  after discharge, the Committee.. should communicate with the local Director of the Brifcisl Red.Cross Society (unless they are able otherwise to place the man in a suitable institution),  who. will  assist. the Hi to -find a bed  for  the  case.  In  these  cases the Local Committee .will  be responsible for all  payments to tin institution and for  allowances to the man and his family: but if any case appears to be  likely to  be incurable tin&apos; Local  Committee may,  under-instruction, request: .tli&apos;; Ministry to take responsibility for the continuation ol all payments.    Many of the cases needing institutional treatment are serious and require  prolonged treatment.  It is desirable that  these cases should be  provided for in large well- managed  institutions,  where  they can have  the  bes&apos; nursing and be provided with all comforts possible.   Tl)&apos;. only institution exclusively, provided for these cases is
35159the  Star and  Garter, Richmond, founded by the Britishlied Cross Society, but it is hoped that additional accorn-Inodation for  this class may be arranged for.ft1    Loss of Limbs and supply of Artificial Limbs.I Cases of loss of limbs  are, as soon as the men are readyJo be fitted with artificial limbs, treated at the SpecialLimbless  Auxiliary  Hospitals.  Of these  the largest isSjueen  Mary&apos;s Auxiliary  Convalescent  Hospital,  Roe-liampton House, Roehampton, which deals with  morethan two-thirds  of  all  the cases.   Others are EdenhallHostel, Kelso ; Princess  Louise Scottish Hospital, ErskineHouse, Bishopston,  near  Glasgow ; the Duke  of  Con-iiiaughfs Auxiliary Hospital, Bray, Co. Wicklow, Ireland ;file  Ulster Volunteer Force  Hospital, Botanic Gardens,pelfast; and  The Prince of Wales&apos;  Hospital, Cardiff.I Any  artificial  limb necessary is  provided before thelnan&apos;s  discharge  from  service.  If after discharge theartificial limb requires repair or readjustment the manfhould be directed  to  report  to  the  nearest militaryhospital, when arrangements will at once be made by thejpflicer in charge to  notify the Ministry of Pensions withV view to the man  being sent back to Roehampton, orpther of the  above  hospitals, unless the  required repairpi&apos; adjustment is o L a  minor character which can  beptisfactorily carried out locally at  a  reasonable cost, inMuch case the matter will be arranged  by the  medicalpfficer of the  local military hospital.  In some cases the condition of the stump may growfworse and require surgical treatment, and in these cases^he Local Committee should send the man to the nearestprilitary or general hospital for examination and treatment.I  &quot;When removal to Roehampton or  one  of the otherppecial   auxiliary hospitals for the purpose of refitting,f he  man&apos;s pension&apos; and allowance will  be arranged  by he  Ministry.  The  man&apos;s stay in these hospitals is, as a ule, not longer than a  few days, but if in any case the Period of stay should be prolonged, the Local Committee re empowered to make the allowances authorised under nstruction   to the wife or dependents.
          &apos;      Ortliopmdic Treatment.  Cases of wound or injury, other than actual  loss oflimb, are most numerous and may at any time need eithermedical or surgical treatment  or orthopaedic  treatment,that is treatment  by massage, electricity or mechanicalappliances designed to retain the function of a paralysedmuscle or nerve.   Orthopaedic treatment is  of specialimportance in the early stage alter a man&apos;s discharge.  Insome of these cases the immediate discomfort felt fromthe injury may be small, and if.it does not interfere withhis temporary employment in  some form  or other theman is tempted  to  neglect proper treatment with theresult  that he may  ultimately  either lose  the use of alimb or member or require, a very much longer and moretedious treatment later.  Local  Committees should there-fore specially mark these cases for attention.  Many of the military and some of the civil hospitalshave some facilities  for orthopaedic treatment, but thereare at present only a limited number of institutions fullyequipped for  this purpose to wbich the more serious case.-can be sent. .  These are the Military Orthopaedic Hospital,Ducane Road, Shepberd&apos;s Bush, London, W.; Alder HeyAuxiliary Hospital, Liverpool;  Welsh Metropolitan&apos;WarHospital,  Whitchurch. near Cardiff ;  Second  NorthernGeneral Hospital, Becketts Park, Leeds;  Beau ford WarHospital,  Fishponds,  Bristol;  ,Edinburgh War Hospital,Bangour;  Old Mill  Hospital,  Aberdeen;  BellahoustonHospital,  Glasgow;   Ulster Volunteer  Force  Hospital,Belfast; Military Orthopaedic Hospital, Blackrock, Dublin:and other  orthopaedic hospitals are in course of  promotion-  Treatment  of discharged men in  these hospitals is innearly all  cases out-patient treatment, and necessitates .theman-being lodged  in  the neighbourhood of  the hospital.IIn any case.where the local military hospital on examina-jtion of the case recommends special orthopaedic treatment,:the  Local Committee  should, communicate  with  theMinistry of Pensions Avho will  arrange for his treatmentat one  of  the above centres..   The Committee will,  beresponsible for all  allowances to the man  and  his famib&apos;and payments to the institution.
                                                 160                    Blinded men.  Cases of  total  blindness on discharge from  Militaryhospitals are sent to St. I)unstan&apos;s Hostel, Regenfs Park,London, in connexion with  which  there  are  branchconvalescent homes  at  Brighton  and Torquay, or in thecase of Scottish soldiers to Newington House, Edinburgh.The men receive in these institutions a course of trainingextending over some months in a large variety of occupa-tions and are wherever possible placed in  employmenton leaving the institutions.  All charges and,allowances for men in these institutionsand their families are paid by the Ministry.             NOTES  ON TRAINING.  Arrangements for training WJI! in all cases  be madeby the Local Committee or Disablement  Sub-Committee,except that in areas where  a Joint  Committee., of twoor more Local Committees has beeir set up. to whichhas been delegated  the power of  advising, arranging foror actually  providing  training,  the  Joint  Committeeshould be referred to before any work of training except-in isolated cases is undertaken.  Not every discharged disabled  man will be a propersubject&quot;, lor  training.  Article 6  of  the  Royal  Warrantwas  not intended to provide  a course of training at theexpense of  the State for any man who merely fanciesa - new  occupation  in  place  of  his  old  one.   UnderInstruction    the determining consideration is  whetherthe  man&apos;s disablement makes training  desirable in hisinterest.  Apart  from  the  cases  in  which  the man isphysically  quite unable to  resume  his  old  occupation,there will be men  in skilled  trades  before  the  warwhose disablement  makes it doubtful  if  they  can  relyon  obtaining  the  wage  they  would  otherwise haveearned  or for whom  it  would  involve risk  to theirhealth to resume their  former occupations.  Again, therewill be discharged disabled men, especially younger men,who were in an unskilled occupation before the war. butwho are of an age and  natural aptitude for training to asuperior occupation to that in which they were previouslyengaged, and whose training will be&apos; a real advantage to
the community.  For these men their disablement mayrender their previous occupations precarious  as a per-manent source of livelihood, and it  may  be  in  theirinterest to  acquire a  skilled occupation which promisesgreater security.  In  considering the fitness of a man for training theLocal  Committee will  look to  the  considerations laiddown in Instruction   , and of these the most importantis that of securing a permanent livelihood for the man.      What trades a man should he trained for.  -  The Local.Committee or  the Joint Committee, as thecase may be, should, at the outset, make enquiry  of  asso-ciations of employers and workpeople  in their area  withregard to the capacity  of  the  various trades to absorbtrained  men  before  they  embark  on any scheme  oftraining. -  The question of  the  training  falls  into two maindivisions    &apos; (a) training of men in factories or workshops ;    (b) courses of training,  in technical institutes or in        similar institutions.    Training for Men in  Workshops or Factories.;  (a) Where it is desired to train an individual man orsmall group of men  in a particular workshop or factory,e.g., in boot repairing  or tailoring, etc., Instruction 15 (2)allows the  Local Committee  to  make  the  necessaryarrangements  for. a small  number of men up  to  5 inany single industry without applying for the  approvalof  the Minister, of Pensions, provided that the  trainingconforms  to  the general   conditions  laid  down  inSchedule  IV to the  Instructions.   Training   for anynumber  in  excess  of. this must  be : submitted forapproval to. the Ministry of Pensions.  Particular atten-tioii is drawn to the requirement  of paragraph    ofSchedule IV, that the employer must undertake to givedefinite instruction to the man, and that the LocalCom-mittee  must  &apos;be satisfied  that the  man  is receivinginstruction.&apos;   The provision of training  at the publicexpense&apos;must not be used merely to  enable a temporary
39161shortage of labour on  the  part of a particular employerowing to  the war or  other causes to  be got  over if theresult: is  to be that the man fails to acquire  any realtechnical  skill which  is likely to  secure him  permanentemployment. .  The Local Committee should  also  as far  as possiblemake it a  condition of training in a factory or workshopthat the  employer  undertakes to give the man employ-ment, if he is found suitable, at the end of the period oftraining.  Paragraph 7 of Schedule  IV has been framed to  meetcases where the  work performed by the man is likelyto be of.some value to his employer during the course oftraining.  In such  cases it is  clearly  advisable that theemployer  should pay the wage which  properly representsthe value of the man.&apos;s  work.  This can  be usually arrangedwithout difficulty.  Thus, for instance an employer mayagree with the Local Committee to pay a man  10s. a weekfor the first two months, and 20s. a week for the third audfourth montbs.   In such a  case  the Local Committeewould pay the man if he had no children 17s. 6d. for thefirst two months and 7s. 6c/. a week for the remainder ofthe period.  As a working rule it should be arranged at the begin-ning of the training what average wages would  be  paidfor successive periods  during the course of training.  -  Training Courses in Technical Institutes or otherwise.  (b) Courses of:  Technical training in Technical Schoolsor  Institutes are on a different, footing, from the  train-ing of individual men in workshops or factories. . Here alsoLocal  Committees should endeavour; to obtain from  localemployers an understanding that they-.will find employ-ment for the men at the end of their period  of training,but it may not  be  always possible to secure a  definiteguarantee.  Hence it is important that the Local  Com-mittees should enquire very carefully not only into, thepresent demand for labour in. the parti&amp;ular trade  butalso into  the.probable demand.for labour  at the oonclu-sion of the war alter the able-bodied men now in thearmy  have returned.  &apos; Some occupations at  the presentmoment  are in temporary  demand,  e.g.,- chaffeurs andmotor mechanics,.but in View of: 1 the;large, supply of
skilled men who will be returning to these, occupationsafter demobilisation, training in them should be avoided.From  this  point  of  view consultation  with employersof labour and with  associations  of workpeople - in -theparticular trade is all-important in forecasting the futurecondition of any  trade and the reasonable probability  Ithat the men when trained will be able to  find employ-II) out..  Proposals for a course or courses  of Technical trainingin an Institute must under Instruction be  submitted asa  &quot;scheme&quot;  for  the  approval  to  the  Minister  ofPensions.   This procedure  is necessary  in  order  toensure  co - ordination  between  schemes   of  trainingput  forward. by different  Local  or Joint  Committees,especially in the  case of proposals from .a number ofLocal Committees  in different  parts of  the country tostart training  men for the same  trade.  It will  be thebusiness of the Ministry, in such cases, to consult theinterests of  the Trade as a whole.  For this purpose TradeAdvisory Committees have  been and are being set up bythe Ministry of Labour acting in conjunction with theMinistry of Pensions,  in each of  the  principal tradeslikely to be affected by Training Schemes,  Each TradeAdvisory Committee consists  of  an  equal number ofrepresentatives nominated by  the  Associations  of  Em-ploy ers and Workpeople  respectively  in the trade  con-cerned.  The  business of these Committees is to advisethe  Ministry  of Pensions  as  to  the  conditions underwhich the training of disabled men in the various tradescan  best be given, the best methods  of  training, thesuitable centres for it, and generally to secure uniformityin the training.                  ,       ;-.  1  In  order  to simplify the procedure as. far as possiblethe Minister of Pensions has embodied in  Schedule IIIcertain: general -  conditions  which  must . ordinarilybe  complied with in any scheme  of  training,  and . theMinistry will  ordinarily  be  prepared  to  approve  anyscheme of training put forward by a Local Committee aslong as it conforms to the general conditions laid down inthose  Schedules.   As  far  as  fees are concerned theMinistry is prepared to pay only the &quot;out of pocket &quot;expenses over and above the ordinary standing expensesof the Technical Institute that  can be shown to be due tospecial arrangements needed for the training.of disabled
411men,  i.e., additional  teachers,  raw  material, &amp;c.  It isreckoned that a fee of 7s. Qd. per head per week will, as arale,  be the maximum that is needed to cover this cost,and in any application for permission to exceed this sumthe Local Committee must be able to prove that thereare exceptional  circumstances.   The manner  in whichthe &quot;  out of pocket expenses &quot; are  arrived at must  in allcases  be stated  in the application from the Local Com-inittee.  Special attention is drawn  to the  need of consultinglocal  associations of  Employers and  Workpeople in  thetrade  concerned.  (See Paragraph  6 of Schedule III and7 of  Schedule TV.)   It is &quot;important in any scheme oftraining  that the opinion  of the  trade should be  ascer-tained, and such consultation before  the  submission of  ascheme  will materially facilitate its ultimate approval.  On  schemes of  technical training  in  Institutes it isvery desirable that the Joint Committee (if one has beenconstituted) should  be consulted  since  it may  well bethat  the Joint  Committee, having  knowledge  of  thetraining  schemes already in operation over a wider areathan that of the  single Local Committee, will be able toadvise and  so on the one hand  to  avoid  unnecessaryduplication  of schemes and on the other hand to makethem  serve as large an area as possible.             &quot;  It must be remembered that there are certain processeswhich are taught in technical schools because they  arespecially suitable for apprentices  or other young persons.Care should be  taken not  to include these processes in ascheme of training for disabled men  merely because theyhappen to be included in the curriculum  of  the technicalschool.   It will  in some cases be found that the periodrequired for learning them is too long for an adult to under-take, in other cases that the special dexterity necessary canonly be  acquired in  youth, or again that the skill neededimplies  an exceptionally  high standard of  intelligence,or that the openings in such trades are extremely limitedin number.  This caution applies especially to such tradesamong others as  plumbing,  telegraphy, saddlery, compo-siting, and woodcarving.  &apos;                  &quot; Special&quot;  Trades.- .&apos;  ...- .        &apos;.  Instruction  lays down that the Minister of Pensionsmay,  after consultation  with the Ministry - of  Labour,
declare any trade to be a special trade.  The declarationof a trade as a.&quot;special trade&quot; will mean that trainingfor that trade will have to be  given in accordance withthe conditions  determined  after consultation  with the ;Trade Advisory Committee.  These conditions will beissued to Local  Committees and will govern not only any.future  proposals  submitted by the Committee but-anytraining already in operation unless in any case  the LocalCommittee can  show special reason to the contrary.  The declaration of a  &quot; Special.Trade &quot; will be made inconsultation with the  Trade Advisory Committee.  Theadvice  of the Trade Advisory  Committee  will be askedupon the period of training necessary, the question of  aspecial improver&apos;s wage if any, after the period of trainingis over, and the number of men  that can safely be trained,taking the trade as a whole into consideration.   In somecases the conditions attaching  to  a certified trade  willcontain provisions somewhat on the lines of the regula-tions governing  apprentices  or learners, though suchconditions may be considerably modified  in  view of thefact that it is adult men and not  youths who are concerned;         Wages of Disabled Men after Training.   General questions affecting  the  rates  of  wages in  agiven trade will  come within the province of  the TradeAdvisory  Committee,  but they  cannot  deal   with  aquestion as to the rate  of wage  that should be paid to anynan so disabled  as not to be able to produce,  even&apos; after raining,  as much as  an able  bodied  man can produce.For this purpose Advisory Wage Boards  have  been andire  being set  up by  the Ministry of Labour  in  all theprincipal towns to which such matters  can be referred1by Local  Committees or  by  the  individual men  oremployers affected.                  Length of Training.   Paragraph 8  of Schedule III. lays down that  the periodof training in  a Technical Institute shall not, withoutthe sanction  of the  Ministry of  Pensions, exceed six months.  If a longer period is desired in any case the Local  Committee must show  that  the &quot;conditions of the trade require it.  It, is recognised that certain trades may require a longer period of training, and! in some, of the
&quot; special&quot; trades a longer period -will be laid down as oneof the conditions under which draining may be given.  Paragraph 8 of Schedule 4 similarly restricts the periodof teaming in a  factory  or  workshop to  four months.Experience  has shown that  a shorter period  of actualtraining is often advisable where the man is to continueworking under the same employer after training.  Here,however, also it is recognised that there are certain tradeswhich -may -require  a  longer period, but for :these thesanction of the  Ministry must be obtained.  In all cases the training given should be  of  sufficientlength to ensure that the disabled man will  acquire suchdegree  of  skill that  he will  have a reasonable prospectof permanent employment.  Only  in  exceptional casesshould training be given  for a shorter period  than twomonths.  The training should as a rule  be given in the,day time,and for a week of 30 hours at least-.   In most  cases itwill be found that a course of from. 35 to 40 hours wallbe advisable.  Training Outside  the Area of the Local  Committee.  A list of the more important courses of training whichhave been approved and of the Institutions in which theyare being given will be issued from time to time to LocalCommittees by the Ministry  of  Pensions, and :in specialcases a  Local Committee  will  be empowered to sendmen-for-training to  one of  these Institutions althoughoutside their own area, subject,  however, to.the  followingconditions :     (a) The Committee should  in all cases  act in agree-        ment with the Local Committee  of the area  to        which the man is  to  be sent, since the latter       - Committee  will   have  been  responsible  for        providingdhe course of training.    (p) A man should not be  sent to a course of training        outside the  area  of  any Joint Committee that        may have  been constituted  without  first con-        suiting the  Joint  Committee, who will,  in the        nature of the case, have wider  knowledge of the        facilities.for instruction within or near its area ;    (c) In no case should a man be sent for training in a        factory or workshop outside the area of the Joint      .  Committee.     ; !&apos;-

i  :  1APPENDIX IX.WAR PENSIONS AO., STATUTORY COMMITTEE.REPORT TO THE PBMSIOMS MINISTERFor week ended 27th June, 191.7.ORGANIZATION BRABOH.Extracts from Reports of Inspectors of Accounts.LANARKSHIRE LOOAL COMMITTEE.          This Committee has heen well organized and theadministration is fairly good but some of the officials of theDistrict Committees,  31 in number, are not altogether satisfactory.The Local Committee took up its work on the 1st November,  1916,  andthe Auditor has made  a most exhaustive examination of the  accountsfor the two months ending 31st December, 1916.    A distinct improve-ment on the part of the District Committees was observable immediatelyafter the Auditor had gone into their accounts with them.    Thepoliey of the Local Committee seems to have been that in no circum-stanees were they to  allow any sailor or soldier or their  dependantsto suffer want, they utilised the funds of the Statutory Committeeas far as possible and in some oases more than they were entitled to.Where they could not  so utilise them, they used a local voluntaryfund.

Sickness Grants are considerably reduced  in the  lastQuarter but the maximum grant seems  always to  be  given when inmany oases^probably 2/6d a week would meet the case.

The Local Committee  are now housed in new Offices andthere is a considerable  improvement  in  the  state of affairs sincemy last visit when three separate Offices were in use.

The Section have considered the proposal of the Local Committee for Kent to provide a course of training in Shorthand and typewriting, out of office hours, for a disabled soldier, A.J.Barton, who is now engaged in clerical work and wishes to become more efficient in his present employment.   It has been decided to sanction this course of training provided the Local Committee are able to assure the Statutory Committee that the man1s present employment is likely to be permanent and that it is impossible to train him for some occupation in which his previous experience as a carpenter would be useful to him,          A similar proposal made by the Local Committee for Lancaster to train a disabled man, S, Oartmell, in olerioal work has been approved, but the Local Committee have been informed that in view of the man&apos;s pre-war occupation as a Tailor this case will be referred to the Trade Advisory Committee on Tailoring and an enquiry as to the possibility of his obtaining employment in which his previous experience would be of value.

APPENDIX XI.         NOTE FOR 2HD READING Oil THE KAVAL &amp; MILITAffi  -         WAR PENSION ETC.  (TRANSFER OF- POWERS) BILL. -  ;1,        The Statutory  Committee was constituted in  1915 forthe double purpose of filling up the gaps which the stress ofwar had made in the arrangements for the administration ofpensions and separation allowances that had been recommendedin the report of the 4th April, 1915, of a Select Committeeof the House of Commons on-Naval and Military Services(Pensions and Grants), and. of providing for the treatment,training and employment of disabled men by the measures.thathad been proposed in the report, dated the 4th May of  thatyear, of the Committee presided over by Sir George Murray.Central and local machinery were set up, the latter largely  -absorbing that of the Charitable Organisations that had  .previously looked after the interests of sailors and soldiersand their fami!ies and;bringing in local /authorities andrepresentatives of labour.    The constitution of over  500local committees in all the Counties and larger Boroughs ofthe United Kingdom, many with sub-committees and districtcommittees, was. a matter of some difficulty and it was nottill the latter half of 1916 that they began to operate.This they did most quickly in&apos; the matter of making advanceson account of separation allowances and pensions and ofsupplementing separation allowances.   The supplementation ofpensions necessarily proceeded more slowly.;.   The provisionof treatment for disabled men was held up by some indecisionas to how far this could be carried out while disabledsoldiers were still in the Army,   The schemes for trainingfirst put forward by Local Committees were delayed by  thedetailed examination necessary to ensure their not resultingin the  overstocking of particular trades with semi-skilledlabour  and schemes for employment were largely dependent ontraining schemes.
175J            2.         In  the meantime  the uns-at isfact-ory&quot; nature - of  the            Regulations with regard  to pensions  and  complaints  of the            way  in  which  they were administered  resulted in  the appoint-            ment of a  Pensions Minister  and  the  introduction of a bill,            on the  14th November* 1916,  into the House  of  Commons to            create  a Pensions department.    The  relations  between the            Pensions Minister and the  Statutory  Committee  were much            discussed  in  the debates on  that Bill.   It originally            provided that the Minister should take over the  work of the            Committee  connected with&quot; the supplementation of  pensions,            leaving to them their full powers in all other respects, e.g.,            the  supplementation of separation allowances,  the making of            grants  or  allowances where no separation allowances were            payable or where by accident they had not been paid, the            determination of various matters of  fact, the  making pro-            vision  for the health, training,  and  employment of disabled            officers and  men, etc.   In  the  course of the  discussion            much was said by some member for leaving to the  Statutory            Committee  their full powers  and  something by others for            taking  away all these powers.    The  general feeling in  the            Commons appeared to be that  the  Committee should continue            their functions under the  control of the Minister and though            there was  some slight opposition by  the friends  of the            Committee  both in the Commons and Lords to  the exercise of            this control  it is provided  for  by Section  3.  of the Act as *C           it passed  on  the 22nd December,  1916,   The section also            provides for  the Committee giving to the Minister adviceI            and  assistance.            3.         These terms have been  loyally carried  out by  the            Statutory  Committee but  they have failed to cover the full            control that  circumstances have  forced on the  Ministry,            The  Royal  Warrant and Order  in Council of the  29th and  30th            March respectively  in addition to absorbing and  superseding                                                                 the
176the regulations of the Statutory&apos;;- Committee with., regard tosupplementary pensions and to obviating the need for thoseunder which special allowances have been given where no statepensions are granted, also gave effect to the wishes ofparliament that the Minister should have power to make generousfinancial provision for the treatment and training of disabledmen.   It has been mainly in arranging for the exercise ofthis power that the Ministry have undoubtedly trenched on thefunctions of the Statutory Committee.   The Committee havingestablished local machinery and prescribed the conditions forits working the problems which arise from day to day all overthe country are not such as can readily be dealt with at head- .&apos;&quot;quarters by sub-committees and sections of sub-committees andfor the Minister *s control over the Committee directing thesebodies it has become necessary that.there should be substitutedcontrol over executive officers actually in communication withthe local committees.   In the visits to different parts of thecountry which the Minister made with a view to informing him-3elf of the different aspects of the treatment and trainingquestions, he came into personal communication-with very manyrepresentatives of these local committees and was satisfiedthat there should be only one central authority to which theyshould look for guidance and control.4.        This was a main consideration moving the Minister toaccept the Statutory Committee&apos;s proposal contained in the letterfrom them to the Prime Minister dated the 19th April last whichhas since been published in the Press,   Undoubtedly the actiontaken by the Ministry to hasten and extend the StatutoryCommittee^ plans for adding to the facilities for institutionaltreatment and for mailing the training facilities which exist atcertain places available over wider areas than those of localcommittees, contributed both to the desire of the StatutoryCommittee to transfer their powers and of the Minister toaccept that transfer and so regularise the position.
5,        It is proposed .ih. the Bill that the transfer to theMinistry should cover all the functions, powers and duties ofthe Statutory Committee still requiring to he exercised,except the administration of those grants which are referredto in the Committee !s letter of the 19th April as differingin character from those ordinarily administered by a depart-ment of the government and in no way covered by the RoyalWarrant or Order in Council.          The principal matters transferred to the Ministrywill he the provision for the care of disabled officers andmen after they have left the service, including provision fortheir health, training and employment;  the supplementationof separation allowances;  the making advances on account ofpensions and separation allowances;  and the determinationof various matters on which the grant or continuance ofassistance may depend.6.        The functions of the Statutory Committee which willremain to be exercised but will not be transferred to theMinistry, will be the making of grants to cover the fewcases where owing to exceptional circumstances the pensionsgiven under the new Warrant may still be insufficient tokeep the dependants of deceased soldiers and sailors inproper circumstances.   They will also be made where noneare possible out of public funds;  and In special cases forthe purpose of enabling the widows, children and otherdependants of deceased officers and men to obtain trainingand employment.   It is proposed that the administration ofthese grants shall in future be entrusted to the RoyalPatriotic Fund Corporation.          The further proposal of the Statutory Committeethat the funds in their possession which were voluntarilysubscribed for specific purposes might also be transferredto the Royal Patriotic Fund Corporation to be administeredby that body, is embodied in the Eill.
1787,        It&apos;is proposed in the Bill to. strengthen the ExecutiveCommittee of the Council of the Royal Patriotic Fund Corpora-tion.   This Committee now consists of not less than 12 normore than 20 members of the Corporation, 1 member beingappointed by ;the Treasury. 2 by the Admiralty, 2 by the WarOffice, and the remainder by the General Council.  The Billproposes that in addition to these persons there shall beappointed by His Majesty to the Committee 5 members,of whom1 shall be a woman, and 2 shall be representatives of labour.8.        For the purpose of assisting the Corporation incarrying out the functions transferred to them the Bill pro-vides that there shall be paid to them  250,000 out of themoneys provided by Parliament for the Statutory Committeeunder Section 1 of the Naval and Military War Pensions etc.(Expenses) Act, 1916. -          It is proposed that the remainder of the moneyprovided by Parliament under the Section quoted should berefunded to the. Treasury, provision for the additional workthrown on the  Ministry of Pensions being made on the votesfor the Ministry which are submitted in the ordinary way toParliament.9.        The  Statutory Committee in their letter to the PrimeMinister of the 19th April referred to the experience gainedby members of the Statutory Committee or their Sub-Committeesbeing placed at the Minister&apos;s disposal after the transfer.This offer was generously repeated in sundry letters frommembers.   Its acceptance is reflected in a clause of the Billwhich provides for the constitution of Advisory Committees andthat such committees should have on them persons who haveacquired special knowledge as members of the StatutoryCommittee or their Sub-Committees.
10.       The Bill contains the usual .clauses for beingbrought into operation on a date to be fixed by Order inCouncil; for safe-guarding the interests of the staff;for continuing the force of existing regulations etc,until altered or revoked by the new authorities;  andfor repealing any enactments no longer required.

But theproof of puddings is in  the eating, the  proof ofsystems in the  working.  And,  as an outsider,who knows  little of anything except character, am going to indicate why I think that, withoutsome very special and sustained effort, there maylie  a slip between this  cup of  comfort  and thenational lips.  .   , - ;: In France, last winter and early spring,  I sawseveral  establishments  for the  professional  re-wlucation of the disabled French soldier, and putthis question to their Directors : &quot; Your systemliiing voluntary, to what degree do you find menavailing  themselves  of  it ? &quot;   The  gist  of theanswers  was : &quot; Not many  came  at  first,. butgradually more and more, till now perhaps we getone-half to two thirds.&apos;&apos;  At &quot; La Maison Blanche,&quot;near Paris,  which draws its men from a  singlehospital  of  700,  I  found that whereas:. whenSir Henry Norman  paid his visit  last autumn,270 were in process of training-400 were trainingwhen I paid my visit this March ;  130 of the othersdid not  need  professional re-education, and theremaining  170 refused.  The  advance, in ,thenumbers  training was  obtained  by  continualpropaganda  at the hospital, which fed theestab-lishment.  Now if,  in France,  we  estimate -thejjroportion of those who, in the long, run, for onereason or another, refuse to  avail themselves.ofprofessional re-education, at even only one-fourth,the French are still going to have amongst them,in the future,  a huge number of men who will bealmost dead weight industrially, and burdens.tothemselves into the bargain.   True, the Frenchmanis by nature an individualist, but he is nothing likesuch a&apos;n individualist as the Briton ; moreover, heis  quicker in  &apos;:.the up-tak&apos;,&quot; and more  impres-sionable. . Further,  he  is  much less  naturallyimprovident and  careless of the  morrow, and Ithink he has more pride.  What then is going to happen in England whereour system is  also voluntary 1  What  proportionof disabled  men  will avail  themselves of thechances offered 1  And what proportion will passby this  &quot; more promising &quot;scheme, and step outinto  the  jobs that for the moment  await almostanyone, in these days of scarce labour %  There\sthe crux that  may-spill our effort.  I should saythat a good  half will refuse their chances, and weshall find ourselves in the  end with more deadweight even than the French, unless we can devisespecial means  against this  disaster.  We have toconvince the disabled that, to be re-educated notonly physically but  professionally,  is  absolutelyessential  to  them,-  against  a future which,&apos; fatenough for the moment, is going in a  few years&apos;-time to  be  very  lean and  hard; and  for.men
 handicapped, -as they  will be, simply impossible, except for charity, which one imagines is the later/ thing they want.  .     .        :   .   ;   It  can!t  be.,\said  too  often that the situation while the  war lasts is  utterly  misleading.  All civilians now feel-grateful and want. to pet and serve the wounded  sbldier.   Labour is hard  to find,  so that anyone-r-even  the handicapped- can get a job.  All that will have gone by the time the war has been from five to ten years in its grave. Most of our  disabled soldiers have thirty,  forty,. or fifty years before them.  The man  who slips his  chance now, and trusts to luck and  gratitude, will  find himself on a beach where  he will get more kicks  than ha&apos;pence,  ten  years  hence.  It. is absolutely natural that he who is sick of dis- cipline and hospitals, should  want -to get back  to ordinary civil life without any intermediate period of hostels, and attendance at training schools and so forth, under a.  sort, of discipline.  I should myself,  and so would any. of  us who write, wisely or foolishly, about these matters.  I  should hate to be hung-up another  six or eight months,  or may be a year, learning a new  job, when  there are  jobs that want  no  learning  waiting for me round the corner, especially if I had &quot; done my bit&quot; and felt that those who hadn&apos;t ought to keep me in comfort for the rest, of my days.  And if anyone came along1  and said  to  me: . &quot; My man, how magnificent your patriotism has been  in the war ! I&apos;m sure that you&apos;11 like to continue to be patriotic now that you are maimed, and serve your country nobly in the future as.  in. the past, by making yourself efficient, instead of being lost to the industrial  life of your . native land ! &quot;   Well--I should want  to get up, and  say: &quot; Cant ! &quot; and smite him in the eye.  When, you have  just lost a limb for the benefit of your country you cannot be expected to be precisely in the mood to appre- ciate talk about. patriotism and sacrifice and  all the rest of it, from those who haven&apos;t lost limbs. No !   If I were  a maimed soldier, I could only be persuaded to get a special training  by being shown convincingly that  if I  didn&apos;t, it was going to be the worse for me,  .   We are all, soldiers included, mclined to forget in.these roaring times times of war the dour and dire   struggle  for  existence that&apos; obtains  in the so-called piping  times  of  peace.  Our  pensions may  be  liberal,  as pensions go, but they are not enough to  live on-much less support a.family, and.the  trouble is this : A few years hence, when people have begun to hate the memory  of a war which jvill have made  the struggle for existence harder, the universal feeling towards the  maimed soldier will become :  &quot; Well, he&apos;s got his pension, that  ought  to be enough. Beside, he  had his opportunity to  get training for - special  employ- ments, and he didn&apos;t take it.  Life&apos;s much too hard  nowadays for  sentiment-they must run their  chances  nowwith the  rest of us, in. fan competition.1&apos;   We know what  that  means-th weakest go to the wall.   A few years hence tht maimed soldier will  only  be secure against uncertain  and perhaps miserable future, if he not among the weakest.. &apos;  I should-say, speaking like a fool perhaps, th the only people capable of persuading the maime soldier, for his own sake to make his future positio a.s strong  as ever he  can,  are  those who kno what  the  life of Labour is like in bad times, ar not mealy-mouthed, and will put the thing bluntl in its naked,  grim reality.  Just now we wr things up  with all sorts of natural and well-mean verbiage, about heroism and gratitude andnev forgetting&quot;; this doesn:t help-on &quot;the contrar it fogs the issue, and endangers the future of tho whom we  want to make secure.  The time h come  for blunt speaking to the maimed soldier people who know how hard life and human  natui are, and how short our memories.  On each Lot Committee under the Scheme, representatives Labour  will  sit.  Cannot  those representatr\ themselves visit  the  disabled  soldiers  of tin districts while  these are still in hospital, and pn before them the grim reality %   If this be impo sible,  for want  of time, cannot  they  have  pov given  them to  appoint visitors  drawn  from i ranks  of. Labour, who can be relied on to conv the truth and not mince matters ?   I can   see  this  most   &quot;promising&quot; scheu langiushing into futility because the Briton will n look ahead, and must run his nose right up again a  thing before he can realise it:s  there.  I can se tens of thousands of our  maimed, turning thi scheme down  with  a shrug, and  the word &quot;  Oh ! thafs all right! Tin not  worrying.  SOnn day,   perhaps!&quot;   That  &quot; some day&quot;  is no likely  to come  at all.unless it comes  at once, hospital, or  as soon  as a man  leaves hospital Labour, by hook or by crook, must prevent the  the  most  deserving of!  Labours  sons-fron courting destruction, prevent their neglecting thi q&amp;ance to make good against a future which, fo all our palaver, is going to be hard, thankless, a11forgetful.                    JOHN GALSWORTHY.    Extension of Institutional  Treatment.  It has now been agreed that institutional treatnienmay be extended  to men discharged for  causes noattributable to war service, iirovided that the  pcrioof treatment is limited to the duration of the war antwelve months afterwards, and subject to certain adjusments in regard to sanatorium benefits, the detailswhich are being considered.

The outcome of  this Conference is the formation of the Enfield Soldiers and Sailors Dependents Provident Association, through which,, the Enfield  doctors  have kindly consented to provide medical attendance and medicine to all cases recommended by the War Pensions Committee for the payment (by the members concerned) of 6d. per  month  for adults,  and 4d. per  month for children under 16 years of age.           .   The, payments will -be. collected weekly  by special collectors from  the  War  Pensions  Committee,  and transmitted quarterly to the doctois concerned.-The scheme provides for  free choice, of doctor, and,not the least of its  advantages lies in the fact that, any grant made by the Pensions Committee on  account of illness, will  now.be  available for nourishment  and medical extras.        -  &apos;           ..:  It should perhaps be added that the scheme is for the duration of the War only, though it is hoped that when

In the meanwhile, there is much to be learnt from thmaterial we have already received.   It is evident thatdetermined and systematic effort is being made by thCommissioners to create a proper atmosphere by meansof a wide-spread campaign of publicity and propagandgenerally.  They point out that it is vitally necessary to the successof this most difficult work that the private citizen shallthoroughly-  understand  and co-operate  in  it.  It  jrealised that the public are entitled  to full informatioand every effort is being made to supply it.   The new.-:papers have  afforded the greatest help, realising thatthis is a matter of the first national importance.  Thelatest development in this direction lies in the preparation and exhibition  of moving picture  films illustratinthe treatment and re-education of wounded soldiers inGreat Britain, France, and Canada, and showing theirprogress up to the stage of final recovery.  All this goesgreat deal further than anything at present accomplishedhere.  In this  country  a deplorable ignorance stillexists in the public  mind, and what is more importantin the mind of  the  disabled soldier himself as to thegeneral facilities that exist for him under the provisionsof the Royal Warrant and regulations  of the StatutorCommittee.   . -----  .&apos; -  It is to be hoped that prompt action will be taken inthis respect,  and that totally unnecessary and unjustfiable criticism should not be directed against- a Government Department such  as  the  Ministry  of Pensionwhich is neither  bureaucratic nor inhuman.  Evidence is still being brought to our notice that bo&apos;men and their  dependants are reluctant to apply \Local Committees, under the mistaken impression thatthe  funds administered by. them  are provided fromcharitable sources.  It is hoped that Local Committeewill  continue to do  all  in their power to  correct thisimpression, and it is suggested that the services of thePress in the localities might be enlisted to  give thenecessary publicity to the actual facts.  The attention of our readers is called ,to the fact thatthe &quot; War Pensions  Gazette &quot; goes to press early, andany contributions should be received here by the 14thof the previous month for insertion in the issue of themonth following. &apos; We shall be  very pleased to receivemore  questions to be answered in our columns.

It may be of  interest to those engaged in Pensionswork to learn something of the operation of a schemein a small county area.   The population of Haddington,including  all the urban centres, is only 43,000.  Thepredominant industry is agriculture, although miningis carried on to a considerable extent in the westernpart of the county.  While the problem is thus a com-paratively small  one, it has presented many features ofinterest and of encouragement for the future welfare ofthe disabled men.                       ..............  The Committee were fortunate in being able to enlistthe sympathy and support of the members of the existingorganisations who had charge of the work prior to July,1916, and to their efforts must be attributed the smooth-ness with  which the change was made. .-  It is believed that in many county areas, owing totheir size, it has not been possible to centralise the workof the  Committee  to the same extent as is possible inurban districts and in small county areas like Hadding-toi). The accounting and the administrative work passunder the supervision of one  Central and ExecutiveCommittee which is representative  of  the nine Sub-Committees operating in the different parts of the county.The Sub-Committees deal in the first instance  withthe applications.   A monthly meeting of the ExecutiveCommittee is held, at Which the cases from the variouslocal centres are reviewed and instructions given thereon^-the disbursements by  each of the Sub-Committeesbeing put directly through the central books.   Thispermits of the accounting for the  whole county beingdealt with from headquarters, and  not only securesuniformity of treatment, but also considerably simplifiesthe work of the auditor and of the accounting generally.The  Sub-Committees above referred  to  have to  do inthe main  with questions of Supplementary SeparationAllowances and other work falling under Part II. of theStatutory Committee&apos;s Instructions.  The most interesting part of the Committee&apos;s workhas however been that relating to the treatment, train-ing and employment of disabled men.  A DisablementCommittee meets fortnightly, and oftener when required,to consider  and deal with disabled  cases.  There are217 disabled soldiers on the County Register at this date.When a disabled man is discharged he is visited by oneof the members of the Sub-Committees, and particularsas to his case embodied in a schedule which is thereaftersent on   to  headquarters.  Prom this  schedule  theDisablements  Committee  is in a  position to  decidewhether a medical report is required, or whether theman should be interviewed by the Committee, or, inshort, what precise initial step should be taken in; thecase.  The schedule referred to gives the name of theman&apos;s  doctor, and if the case.is  one  for  report,  theschedule is sent on&apos; to the doctor, whose report is writtenon the  back  thereof.  In  the majority of cases  thedoctor&apos;s report enables the Committee to dispose of thecase.   There are however a number of special  caseswhich require more detailed consideration, and a verysatisfactory  arrangement  has been  made  with thePresident of the JEtoyal College  of Physicians, Edin-burgh, and the President of the Royal  College of Sur-geons there, whereby they examine and report on specialcases.  This course has been found to be most helpful.  Erom  the medical reports  thus received  the  Com-mittee have no  difficulty in arranging for the menreceiving in-patient treatment in the military hospitals,or  out-patient treatment  as  the cases may require.Lieut.-Col.  Cathcart, of  Edinburgh, has been  goodenough to examine and report on cases of disabled menwhose artificial  limbs require adjustment or renewal.and his advice has been of the greatest value and assis-tance to  the Committee..  The general experience  of the Committee is that it isof the utmost importance to get into  persona! touchwith the men.  A great many difficulties can be at onceremoved and the men encouraged to take a more hopefulview  of  their position.   One of the most  gratifyingfeatures  is the general  desire among disabled men tofollow the advice given them by the members of theDisablements Committee, and to take advantage of theopportunities thus opened out for them.   Under thescheme in operation in this county there is no difficultyin keeping in:touch  with the disabled men, notwilh-standing that many parts are very sparsely populatedand are  isolated.  As already indicated, most  of thecases can be satisfactorily dealt with  from the casepapers,&quot; and  it is only  those suffering from a greaterdegree of disablement who are specially interviewed bythe Disablements Committee.  There  is a disposition in. some instances for men totake up  employment rather more readily than is con-sistent with their complete recovery, and it is fearedthat this may present a serious problem in the future.Disabled men are discouraged from taking up employ-ment when treatment would be more beneficial, or whena course  of training combined wjth treatment, would bemore  in the interests of the: disabled men.So soon ascomplete schemes of trainihgare available/and oh muchmore ambitious lines than at present exist, the tendencyfor men to lose heart and to take up unsuitable employ-ments will  largely disappear.  The  arrangements fortraining at present in force can only be looked upon IjQtemporary expedients. &apos; Up to the present, however, ithas not been difficult to deal with (a) cases unsuited bytheir  injuries to follow their former occupations^ and(&amp;)  men  requiring  further medical  treatment  beforeundertaking  training.  The  Committee  have  beenfortunate in providing suitable training for the first class.As an instance it may be mentioned that limbless menhave been induced to take up  and are being trained incobbling. A joiner, whose injuries made it impossiblefor bim to follow his former occupation, is being trainedas a  teacher  of  woodwork at one. of  the provincialcolleges.  . Openings have been found for a number ofmen in handloom weaving. *        ;&apos;  -  As  regards the second  class, a number of the men

There seems to be a generaldesire among these patients  to  be. trained in motordriving, and, in very exceptional cases, the  Committeehave not discouraged  this course,.:although generally.speaking they endeavour to persuade  the  men to entersome, other line.

The arrange-.ments with- the I military hospitals  are working  satis-faetorily.  - Discharged men have been  admitted in somecases for operation and in-patient treatment generally,while a number, receive out-patient treatment.  It may be noted that the Committee have not directlyappointed hospital visitors, it being found more, satis- -factory for those Committees in whose  areas the military -hospitals. are, to. get in touch with  men notified  fordischarge.  The Committees.  referred  to have  beengood, enough to send full, reports on  the  various, casesto  the Committee of the. man&apos;s place of residence.   Itis thus possible to arrange for suitable  treatment for thecase and.to have the man readmitted to hospital,&apos; wherethis turns; out :to be ^desirable owing to the  nature of theman&apos;s disabilities and.the distance.of his home from the &apos;ho spitals. - : The. arrangement for.&apos; the. visitors seeing theman before. discharge, is a most happy one, as he can bemore readily  got at and interested in.schemes for.-treat--ment and. training;before being discharged, and beforelie loses  touch with the hospital.  This  leads one  toemphasise the. importance  of  treatment  arid traininggoing hand in hand.; Now that Joint. Committees; havebeen set  up;tofind facilities for the  proper, treatmentand training  of men over large areas,  perhaps the diffi-culties which have  in  the  past  been  experienced willdisappear.-  The case of the men who have been discharged withtemporary pensions, owing to the difficulty of definitelystaling at the date of the man&apos;s discharge  what injuriesare permanent and what temporary, would, it is thought,l( more satisfactorily  dealt  with if treatment  andtraining were conjoined, and the men transferred to asuitable place for.-further treatment  and  for training,-rather &quot;than  discharged and  sent  home.   Instancescould be cited where the latter arrangement has notworked satisfactorily.  The men  may, be  fit for  some&apos;form of employment or for training, but instances havearisen where  they have been aveise to avail themselvesof opportunities, and, until  the pension is  permanentlyfixed, it is exceedingly difficult to persuade  the men thateither employment or training are in their best interests.hi  cases of treatment the same difficulties are not metwith.

The Hospital wasopened at the end of June, 1915, and the EmploymentBureau was  started a few  weeks later, so  that theexperience gained has been varied and considerable.   In the early days of the Hospital the general organisa-tion was necessarily incomplete and the present methodof dealing systematically with the question of the employ-ment of each newly admitted patient, and again with.each man on his discharge, had not been evolved.  Upto the end of May 7,230 men had been discharged fromRoehampton,  fitted with their  artificial limbs, and ofthese  6,472  had  been dealt with  for employment.Among those unaccounted for are a large number fromoverseas, the problem of whose future careers  does notcall for local solution, and a certain number  of  caseswhich  for  various reasons  could  not be  handled atRoehampton.  For a. long  time  pastj  however, . nopatients, except.those habitually domiciled outside theBritish Isles,&apos; have been allowed to enter or leave theHospital without  passing through the hands of theEmployment Bureau so that bur records, in their laterstages, are absolutely completed   In a memorandum which I wrote on  the 26th February,and which .has been widely circulated, I dealt generallywith the problem  of the training  and employment ofdisabled men,  I see no reason to modify in any way theconclusions therein set forth.   In this article I propose to confine myself  mainly to abrief description  of  the  general system in vogue atRoehampton, and to. a consideration, of the. experiencegained in various directions.   It cannot be said, as time goes on and as the problem.to be faced grows ever larger&apos;and more complex, that thedifficulties  to be  contended with  become easier  ofsolution.  The problem is a many sided one  and hasvaried  continually during, the past two years.   Duringthe earlier stages of the war the prospects  of  disabledmen were wrapped in obscurity in that the old idea stillobtained that the man incapacitated, by reason of hisinjuries, from further active service in the fighting rankswas  likewise more or less incapacitated from - activeservice in the industrial ranks of the country.  Prejudicedies hard, and it has needed the combination of circum-stances which the war has created to convince employersof labour that a man, even though he has lost a limb orhas otherwise been grievously injured in the service ofhis country, is still capable of proving himself a valuableservant.  Shortage of labour has made it necessary foremployers to seek assistance in fields  which they wouldnever have considered in times of peace, and the resultof such exploitation has been to demonstrate  to  them and to the world generally that..provided the disabled man is not asked to do work for which his disablemen4 clearly unfits him, there is nothing to prevent him from proving himself in every  respect  as useful as his moiv fortunate able bodied competitor.   The class of work which has been available for disabled.men has necessarily varied with  the. eArer changing industrial  conditions.  During the  first  year  of mv experience of the problem I found that the demand was almost entirely confined to men for unskilled purposes, Plenty of work of this nature was to be had at full wages. which was well within the capacity of men who had lost a limb, and they were  glad to avail themselves of the opportunity of such employment.   Unfortunately, hov- ever, there.were two sides to this picture, and it soon became evident  that work easily- obtained was  equally easily lost or given up.   Some men appeared to think that they could play fast and loose with the position, knowing that if they gave up a job at 30s. one day they could.get half a  dozen more at the same wages the day following/And so it happened.  Men frequently ae- cepted employment which they did not take up or they took up work with no  intention of keeping it.  They were possessed with, an altogether false sense pfinde- pendence.   Ere  long,  however,  the day came when these easy jobs became fewer and further apart, and when the  active competition  of women and boys, for posts which they were equally capable of occupying, had the effect of. restricting the openings  which had previously been so easy to obtain.   Quite apart from.this it became increasingly evident that disabled men could not expect, when demobilisation takes place, to hold their own in the  unskilled labour market against able bodied competitors, and that this form of employment should, therefore, as far as possible be avoided for  them.  Personally, I have  made it a general rule never to accept  unskilled work for a man except on the assurance that he would  not be dismissed at the end of the war,  provided that he  performed his duties satisfactorilyit must, nevertheless,  be remem- bered that in certain cases of disability there is no choice between some form of light unskilled work and idleness. and that oh such occasions one must of necessity bow to circumstances. .        &apos;  f-Let us  now turn to  the question of skilled labour. wherein lies the only real solution of the problem of lp future of the disabled man.  Up to some twelve months ago,  there was no appreciable  development  of the industrial demand for disabled men, but with the in- creasing requirements of  the Military Authorities and the corresponding depletion of the. ranks of men skilled in various trades there came a great and rapid change in the position.   It may be said that the  falling off in the demand for. unskilled workers and the increase in. the demand for skilled hands were to all intents and purposessimultaneous, this circumstance being in itself sufficient to point to the direction in which an outlet  for the activity of disabled men should be sought.  There is m need to enlarge  on the fact that it is now.universally recognised, not only in this country, but in the other
 belligerent  countries,  that  some  form: of  technicalframing for the disabled is the one thing to be aimed at, and that everything is being done both in England and elsewhere to increase the facilities for such training and to induce the&apos;men in whose, interests these facilities have heen created to make the fullest use thereof.:.     -  .&quot;   ;   Having considered the general aspect of the situation ]. will next state what the Roehampton Authorities have done in the matter and with what measure of success their efforts have been attended.   In the first  place it is to be noted that  those who originated  the  idea and undertook the organisation of a Hospital, for the  pur- pose of fitting men who had lost a limb in the war with the  latest  and  most  perfected artificial appliances, foresaw that, in order that these men might be returned to civil life with the means of earning a livelihood, such technical training as could be given to them in Hospital should be afforded.  The project rapidly took  shape and thanks to. the  generosity of Lady Wantage and to the active and  expert  assistance of Major Robert Mitchell, Director  of Education of the  Polytechnic in  Regent Street, excellent workshops were designed and erected and became ready for. use by the end of 1915.  This was the first attempt in England to deal in a practical way with the problem of the future  employment  of our disabled  sailors and  soldiers  while  the men  were still undergoing treatment.   The success of the undertaking was not immediate, but with the gradual dissipation of the fear  entertained by the men that their pensions would be endangered by any increase in their earning power, more confidence was established and the capacity of the workshops and of the instructors Was in.the end taxed to the uttermost. Another point which for some lime militated against Success was that the men felt that they did not remain sufficiently long at Roehampton to render&apos;it worth  their whiletd undergo training.  To combat this the  resources of  the- Polytechnic were generously placed  at the disposal of Roehampton men, free  of charge, so  that those:going through the classes at the Hospital  might be passed: on, when  they  were discharged,&apos; for such further training as they required. Similar generous facilities were offered, free&apos; of cost, by the  Cordwainers&apos;: Technical College  and by  Clark&apos;s College, while the developments which have since taken [IUOC have rendered it possible  to  offer men whatever tuning they require in the. various Technical Institutes throughout the country.&apos;:&apos;- Thus all the original difficulties have by degrees been overcome.  &apos;   The  training-facilities  provided  at  Roehampton include:;- * &quot; : &quot;...&apos;.     7              &apos;  - .::v.  ...,:     &apos;.

Every patient is interviewed the day after he enters&apos;the Hospital, when his industrial history is recorded andhis wishes.as to the future are ascertained.; As 40 percent,  of the men.return to their former employers anda further 35 j)er  cent., who will  only  consider, employ-ment near their homes, come automatically under thecare of the local Committees, it follows that the bulk ofthose who  are prepared to undergo training at Roehamp-ton are drawn.from the ranks of the remaihing 25 percent., who are, as a generalrule, ready to accept  workanywhere.;: It.is  interesting and.gratifying to note that 81 per cent, of this last mentioned class are at:the presenttime accepting training..  The stay of  the men at Roe-hampton is now so much shorter than it used to.be thatthe training which can be afforded there is necessarilylimited.   It is however sufficient, to enable the men tocome to a decision as to their future careers, and theyare then passed on to the Technical. Institutes.   Every-thing that is possible: is done, both by personal inter-course and persuasion  and by collective addresses,. tobring home, to the- men the  advantages of  making thefullest use  of the opportunities which are offered to them.   As  I haye recorded  in the Memorandum,- to whichreference has been made, I am convinced that the secret
of dealing successfully with the men lies in handlingthem, if possible, collectively and in groups, before theyare discharged from the Army.&apos;  I am very certain that-during the last few weeks in Hospital the men are moreimpressionable and can be reasoned with more readilythan  is possible once  they have been discharged andhave  come under home influences which are, as often asnot, inimical to  their best interests.&apos; The problem is adifficult one and will not become easier, but in whateverform  it is presented it can  and must be successfullydealt with.  The local War Pensions Committees havean intricate task before them, a task in regard to whichthe experience of others will, I hope, be of some value.Let them face it with the never failing&apos;recollection thatwhat is most called for is the fullest exercise  of humansympathy and understanding.  No two cases are exactlyalike  ; ho two men are alike.  Those who look well areoften only outwardly and physically so.   Mentally theyhave, it has frequently been proved, failed to recovertheir normal balance. - They require to be helped and to ;be guided in every way.  All allowances must be madefor them!   They are sensitive to a degree and are easilydiscouraged.  On the other hand they respond readilyto kindness and to sympathy.  It often depends on howa man is handled whether he is made or marred for life.I write from the fulness of my conviction of  the  over-whelming importance of the psychological aspect of theproblem.  Those who realise this fact and who act on itwill succeed..  Those who fail to do so will  bring grievousdisappointment  to the men and will  miss their ownopportunity.  :  In conclusion I plead for the fullest co-operation at alltimes in dealing with the wants of  Roehampton men.Sooner  or later they nearly all come back to us to berefifcbed and we, therefore,  never quite lose touch withthem. : Any assistance which! can give is always at thedisposal of the  Local Committees,  and  with the  re-ciprocity on their part, which I know I can look for, thefuture welfare of men whose misfortune it has been  tolose  a limb will be safeguarded as far as is humanlypossible.    :        :   - -       - &apos;         &apos;  *- -: *- -                            DUDLEY B.

Mr. Haydn Jones asked whether any scale is m forcefor the salaries of clerks to borough and county pensionscommittees;  and. what proportion  is. borne  by theTreasury and. what safeguards have  been  adopted tolimit expenditureunder this head ?.&apos; Mr.  Barnes: There has hitherto  been no  scale inforce for. these salaries,- and no. proportion to be borneby the Treasury has  been: fixed.  Where pending themaking of permanent arrangements the adnimistrativeexpenses of local committees, including these salaries..have been paid out of the funds supplied by the Statu-tpry Committee, local committees have been  requiredto submit estimates to the Statutory Committee, whoin approving them have given due regard to the reason-ableness of the salaries proposed.

Mr. Byrne asked the  Pensions Minister:  whether asoldier,  disabled to the   extent, say, &quot;of one-half hisearning capacity, receives only one-half  of the totaldisablement  pension  of  27s.  6d. per  week;  if onlypartially disabled is he expected to. find work whicliwill suit his physical  capacity ;  and,  if so, whether, ifsuch discharged soldier is  willing to workbut is unabltto find employment to suit his condition, he will con-sider the desirability of granting a temporary  pensionover and above the pension granted until such time aswork suited to Ins physical capacity can be found ?

Mr. Ramsay Macdonald asked the Prime Minister if I the  Government  proposes to  consider  whether  the  families of dependants of men of the Mercantile Marine I who have lost their lives at sea owing to the action of  the enemy should be eligible for pensions ; and to what I department inquiries on the subject shoxdd be addressed ?   Mr. Roberts : The  Prime Minister has asked me to Ianswer  this question.  Arrangements were made early I jn 191.5 for placing officers and men of the Mercantile 1 Marine  in the same position, as regards pensions and j compensation for injury, as  officers and men of Fleet [Auxiliaries.  The scheme is administered by the Board I of Trade.   Mr. G.  Terrell asked the Pensions Minister whether I the cases of men discharged from the Army as medically I unfit  and refused pensions  under  the  Regulations  hitherto in force are  being  reconsidered; and, if so, I whether he can furnish  particulars of the number, - or&apos; Ipercentage,-of such cases hi-which pensions have been I granted under the new Royal  Warrant which.became operative  on the 4th instant ?  -   The Parliamentary  Secretary.to  the Ministry  of Illusions (Sir A. Griffith-Boscawen):  The answer to the I first part of the question is in the affirmative.  Nineteen llmndred applications have been received mainly in the last two weeks, from. men. who. have been discharged pom the Army, and refused pensions under the Regu-  tions hitherto in force.  Up to the end of last week  HI pensions and 300  gratuities had been awarded  in Ithese  cases and the remainder  are in hand at  various Istages of consideration.   Mr.  George  Terrell  asked  the  Pensions  Minister I whether the cases of widows of  sailors and soldiers who had previously been refused pensions or gratuities, and of those who  had previously received &quot;gratuities only, are being re-considered; and,  if so, whether  he. can 1^ be the number of such cases dealt with up to date, land in.how many  of them  pensions have now been I granted ?  .-...&apos;.  Sir  A.  Griffith-Boscawen: The number of widows&apos; . claims rejected for  pension or  gratuity under the old: I Regulations was 1,229,  and  the number rejected  forJ pension, but admitted for gratuity, was 475, making aItotal  of 1,704.  Of this  number, 1,013  have been re- i-onsidered, 983 have been admitted to pension,  and130 have been finally rejected.  The re-consideration  ofJtlie remaining cases  Mill be completed in the course of aJfortnight.  Mr. Pennefather asked how many sailors and soldiersI discharged as medically unfit have been  dealt with byIt lie Pensions Ministry to  date   what percentage of the total have been pensioned ;  what percentage have been given gratuities ;  and what is the average amount of the gratuities?                      -       .         . .   Mr. Barnes : Of the  31,590 sailors and soldiers&apos;dis-. charged as medically unfit since the Ministry took over its  duties on the  15th  February,. 81*9 per cent,  have received pensions and 7*8 per cent, gratuities..  Of the 13,540 so discharged since  the  new Order in Council and Royal Warrant  came into.force on 4th April, 84*7 per  cent, have received pensions  and  15  per&quot; cent. gratuities.  Out of 3,000 men who since  the latter date have applied for reconsideration of refusals to pension them under previous warrants  367  have been given pensions and 404 gratuities, and the remaining applica- tions which have, come  in-rapidly in the last  few  days are in hand at various stages  of  consideration.  The average amount of gratuities could not  be ascertained without analysing the 2,500 cases  in  which gratuities have been awarded, and I trust my hon&apos;. Friend will not attempt to impose this task upon us at the present time.   Mr. Hogge : Will  the Pensions Ministry be able to overtake the reconsideration of refusals to the extent that the right hon.. Gentleman hopes ?   Mr. Barnes :. It all depends upon whether or not the applications are sent in.  Only  3,000  cases.have  been sent in, and we bave to  wait until they are sent in.  Of the total number I thought that we might have had a very large percentage before now, but we have only had a small fraction.                 Medical Treatment.   Mr. R. McNeill asked the Pensions Minister whether his attention has been called to  the hardship inflicted on poor people by being required  to.  pay for medical certificates in connection with the receipt of pensions ; Avhether  he  is aware that  in many -cases a. medical examination has to take place every three months,/and that in remote districts  the  pensioner has to tray el by train or hired vehicle.considerable distances to undergo examination, andthat the cost, of travelling, in addition to the cost  of the  medical certificate,  substantially reduces the amount of the pension ;  and whether, under these circumstances,  he  will authorise local committees to refund at their discretion the expenses incurred in obtaining medical certificates ?    .   Mr. Barnes :  For the State pension, as, of course, the hon. Member knows, no expenditure by the pensioner on medical certificates is required.   It is necessary to obtain certificates in the case of  disabled persons  who require  treatment,  and, in  order to assess earning capacity, in  the case of applicants for supplementary pensions.  As a general rule, the certificates of the panel or hospital doctors are sufficient.   I am not aware of any cases of hardship inflicted on poor people  by their being required to pay for  certificates or by their having to incur travelling expenses, but if the hon. Member will give me particulars of the cases which he  has in mind I will have them investigated.   Major Chappie asked what provision is to be made for
 the medical treatment of widows and orplians of soldiers ahd sailors during and afterithe War 2  :  .&apos;.&apos;--   Mr. Barnes :  The  National Health  Insurance  Com- missioners are now considering at my request how the medical treatment of widows and orphans of sailors and soldiers-killed in the present War can best be provided. My  hon.  Friend is  doubtless aware  that the whole question of medical service will be further dealt with in connection with the proposal  to establish a Ministry of Health.                    Employment.   Mr. Neville asked  the  Under-Secretary of State for War whether the Government has set up any, and, if so, what organisation for helping to find employment for officers of His Majesty&apos;s  Forces who  have been dis- charged from the Army and Navy by reason of wounds or illness contracted diu-ing service ?  Mr. Bridgeman : My hon.  Friend has asked me totake  this  question.  The Professional and BusinessRegister, which is a section of  the Employment Depart-rnent of the Ministry of Labour, is charged with the dutyof finding employment for officers discharged from theArmy and Navy,  who  are referred to  it by the WarPensions  Statutory   Committee.  This  register  is intouch  with  Government  Departments and businesshouses throughout the  country, and immediately dis-charged  officers  are  available their   particulars aresubmitted to possible  employers.

Questions * and  Answers.   Q. 12. Where gratuity only is granted under the Moi;, Warrant of March 29th, 1917, para.17 (1) or (2) there ; generally delay in payment.  .Can a man iii pecuniar difficulty (e.g., owing to cessation of help under Regulatvx 11 (c) be given advances recoverable from the gratuity tunic Regulation 6 of Part 2 of the Statutory Committee Reguh, tions? S.E.   A. No advance may be  made  against a  gratuity It is not  clear why help under 11 (c) shoidd not 1.x available if the Committee have recommended the casi to the Statutory Committee for a special allowance.   Q. 13. Where a man lias been receiving treatment am alloivances under Regulation  12 (6) of Part 2  either a. having a temporary disability pension or as coming icilhl, Regulation 11 (c) and his previous status is altered h grant of gratuity (say under para. 7 (2) of Warrant), is k still eligible  for assistance  under  Regulation  12 (b)  o. Part 2 until treatment is over 1 S.E.  -A. If the man is receiving treatment a grant under Regulation 12  (&amp;)  may be given  until  the course i; completed.   Q. li-May an  alloiuance be given in the case of a tvif whose only child is admitted to a rate or State-aided bisii- lution and whose separation  alloicance  is [consequently reduced from 19s. 6c?. to 12s. 6c7. a week.   A.-If, as is probable, this substantial reduction ii. income results  in hardship and the mother is not ii, employment, the case may be treated as coming within Regulation 7 (1) (d).   If, however, the  absence of the child is likely to extend over a long period, it would he reasonable to expect tho mother to obtain employment, if she is able. &apos;.- Q. 15. rln a case where a dependant is receiving Ss. 9dper week, how do you arrive at the assessed dependence 1-H.M.8.
