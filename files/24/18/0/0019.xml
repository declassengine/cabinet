The number of vacanciesreported this week which cannot be filled is 206, but this figuredoes not in any way represent the total number of farmers whorequire but are unable to obtain woman labour.          The Group Leaders appointed for part-time workers continueto. give great satisfaction, and three additional appointments havebeen made this week.
