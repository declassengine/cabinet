SEC R E T.                    .    MI-      -                     /                TRANSFER OF BRITISH AND GERMAN PRISONERS                   CF  WAR TO HOLLAND.&apos; :  &apos;          (Letter from the. Foreign Office,  dated 30th June,1917                    to tho Secretary,  War Cabinet.)Dear Sir Maurice Hankey,         With reference to my letter of Jesterdey enclosing .a copyof a telegram from Lord Newton (No.1866 from the Hague) about thetransfer of British and German prisoners of war to Holland, I writeto draw attention to the fact that the matter is extremely urgentas the German Delegates are leaving shortly.         I understand that the War Cabinet are to meet on Mondayafternoon so perhaps you could get a decision at that time.         Lord Newton also asks in Hague telegram No.1867 of&apos;the28th June for a decision as to the Port in this country to beused for the repatriation of British and German Prisoners of War.         The Admiralty consider Southwold to be wholly unsuitableand suggest Holyhead.  Failing Holyhead the-Admiralty can onlyagree to a Port in the Thames Estuary.         I have telegraphed the Admiralty view to Lord Newtonbut as he sent his telegram to the v.ar Cabinet, perhaps it wouldbe better to obtain their endorsement of the Admiralty view.            ,           Yours very truly,                             (Signed) &apos; G. R. WARNER.DRAFT.-. TELEGRAM. To-  Sir W. Townley   (The Hague)                            -       July 1st,  1917.... URGENT.  Your 1886.            Following from War Cabinet to Lord Newton. &apos;\           Proposal quite acceptable,  but impossible without           further consideration to commit ourselves to exact           numbers and proportion of combatants to  civilians.2,/Whitehall Gardens,  S.W,-    : 1st.
