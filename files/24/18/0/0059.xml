Note by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.      (Circulated with reference to %ir Cabinet 173, Minute 24.)S,T.1242    1.  I received last night the copies^ of letters of      Sir Bryan Hahon and Viscount French on the state of Ireland,      which had been circulated to the ^7ar Cabinet, with the request      that I should report upon the matters in question.   I am      preparing a report.           2*  The case does not now press for action, as upon my      return from Ireland last week,  I put forward amendments of the      Defence of the Realm Regulations, dealing with the specific      matters as to which Sir Bryan Mahon expresses anxiety, namely,      meetings and processions, marching, and the wearing of the      &quot;Irish Volunteer&quot; uniform, and Regulations&apos; conferring upon      competent military authorities powers of absolute prohibition      were approved by His Majesty the King at the Privy Council on      Thursday.           3.  I propose to deal with the subject more generally and                                           and      to consider the relation of the civil/military powers in Irelaid      in the report which I have in hand.      3rd July, 1917                           (intld.)
