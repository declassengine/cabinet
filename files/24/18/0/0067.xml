S E CHE T,&quot;-&apos;WAR  CABINET.                 .           0G T  1266.                                                       &quot;   -*      INCREASE  IN  THE  OUTPUT  OF BBIR.               MemorandiiH? &quot;by  the  Pood  Controller              (Circulated with  reference to  War Cabinet  16V)        I have  had.under  consideration the  decision of the WarCabinet of June 21st.  to  permit  the brewing of 33  l/zfo of beer.,over and above  the present&quot; allowance,  from  now to  the  end of.September,  031 certain  conditions  as to strength and price.        This decision  was  reached at a meeting at  which neitherI nor any representative  of my Department was  present.    Yet itclearly affects the work  of the Ministry of Food in several ways.   (l)      It will lead to  an earlier  exhaustion of the stocks           of malt (probably by November in place  of February           next).  Consequently unless the  summer  increase  of           brewing is  followed by further restriction  later,  it           will diminish  the supplies  of barley available for .           food in the year 1917/18.(2)      The  increased use  of grain for  intoxicating liquors        will1 unquestionably affect public opinion in the        country,  and may thus injure the campaign for volun-        tary food economy,&quot;   This, type  of.-public  opinion may        be right  or  wrong,  but it has to be taken Into        account.        Since the present restriction on Browing Is effected by anOrder of the Food Controller,  the proposal of the Cabinet couldonlybe carried out by an amendment of that Order or issue oflicenses under it by the  Food  Controller.        Assuming that the&apos;principle of the Cabinet decision ofJune 21st to allow an additional use of Malt in the next threemonths up to 33 1/2$. and  at  the s^e time  to secure, furtherdilution of Beer,  Is.to be . accepted, the following Scheme may besuggested for giving effect  to  this principle :-   (1)     That 13 l/3yl&apos; extra barrelage shall be brewed at a gravity           not exceeding  10360  under the directions of the Food           Controller and shall be  held.at his disposal for dis-           tribution to Munition Areas and Agricultural Districts           for Harvest, -.   (2)     That Brewers shall have  the option of brewing 20^ extra           barrelage on the  following conditions       (a)    That they brew  50^ of the total amount they are per-             mitted to brew  (including the extra 20p)  at an average             gravity not  exceeding  the average gravity of their             total brew in the  corresponding quarter of 1916.             That they brew  and distribute dOfo of the  total amount             they are permitted to  brew (including the extra 20^)             at h gravity not exceeding 1036 0.                 &apos;       (c).    That not more than one-third  of the total output for             the quarter-be  distributed in any one month,  but where             the allowed  quantity has not  been&apos; readied in any month,             any balance  may be,carried forward to next month.(b)
(3)  That to. any person who has  a  right to  claim harrelage  or     certificates,  the brewer  shall  be  entitled to give harrelage     or certificates for  50$ of  the  beer not  exceeding 10360,(4)  That in the event of any  brewer deciding within  (seven) days     from the date  of the Orders not to avail himself of this     optionj th* Pcod Control.).sli-Al bo free to transfer  the     right to brev/  his extra &quot;barrelage to some ether brewer.     Although this  Order  might meet  with opposition from themakers, of special classes cf beer, it is thought that they  willmake, a special endeavour  to cone in  under the scheme  as theyfdlly realise that  they might  stand  out before the Public asconspicuous examples of unwillingness to provide a remedy forthe present shortage of-beer while the  rest of the trade agreedto the scheme.   After interviewing  representatives of the  tradefrom all parts of the country, I am  of the  opinion that thescheme will be generally  accepted  and is the  best method forsecuring the.largest amount of extra bulk barrelage without over-penalising the brewers..     The total output of  beer  for  the year  1917/18 will there-fore be 12,420J000  standard barrels  made up as follows.10,.700/000 standard barrels, the statutory barrelage under  theIntoxicating Liquors (Output and Delivery)  Order,; plus 750,000additional standard barrels., for  the  Army (to  be; brewed underlicence) plus the additional summer  beer estimated at about970,000 standard barrels.     The question of the  price&apos;of  beer has been carefully con-sidered but I am not - able to frame any satisfactory scheme  forfixing the price by Government action short of State  control.I hope,. however,  that a satisfactory reduction will be made bythe trade.     This, increase  in the output of  beer so shortens the lifeof existing Malt  Stocks that it.  is necessary  that the questionOf allowing Halting of the new&apos;Season1 s Barley should be settledat once, so that  Maltsters can make  the necessary arrangementsfor fuel and labour,&quot;     Malting must be resumed in  September if  any brewing is.tobe permitted next Autumn  and Winter.  So that only the minimumquantity of Barley-need be&apos;malted, a Cabinet  decision is re-quired, as to the quantity Of beer  to be &quot;brewed during the yearending 30th September, 1918.The alternatives appear to be     (l)  To continue at  the rate  of 10,700,000 Standard barrels &apos;          p.&apos;a. throughout the  year.     (2)  To continue at  the rate  of 10,700,000 standard barrels          p.a. plus 33 1/3^ throughout the year.     (3)  To continue at. the rate  of 10,700,000 standard barrels          p.a., till the end.of June,  1918 and give an additional          33 1/3$ in the  summer  quarter alone as in thi3 year.     The Army beer  to be  additional  in each case.    As soon  as the  amount has been settled, a scheme for con-rolling malting  can be framed and put into operation.
     In raising this  point  it would he advisable for adecision to be given  ae  to  whether Brewers who have Maltingsshould be allowed  to  Malt,  or whether Maltsters only shouldbe permitted to manufacture.    The number of waitings inBrewersr hands -rculd  be  sufficient to supply the require-ments of the whole trade, and if they were allowed to malt,the whtle of the Maltsters&apos; business xvould be ruined.     Brewers generally incline to the opinion that a schemeeould be arrived at on these lines by which Maltsters forsale (other than a Brewer)  could be allowed to make theentire season&apos;s  requirements.(Signed)   HHONDDA.July  4th,, 1917.-
