                     WAR CABINET.BEOKBT.                                                        ^ 2i(JT. 1260A.^^MMF         ^^ni^TARY. OF STATE  FOR THE  COLONIES TO            THE  GOVERNOR GE1ERAL OF CANADA.(Sent 6.10 &apos; p.m.,  50th June 191?)30th June,         Chancellor of Exchequer asks that following oommuni-cation may he conveyed to Canadian Government..         Telegram has heen received from Imperial MunitionsBoard estimating July reguiresents at ^69,000,00.6,  TheCanadian Finance Department premises ^25,000,000 and theBritish Treasury&apos;, is asked to furnish the balance of 044,000,000.         Only two methods of providing this sum are openapart from assistance from-Canada.(1) from the British TreasuryAccount in New York (2) release of gold.   The United StatesGovernment object to the use of funds provided by ..them exceptin payment of expenses incurred in the United States and thiscovers only-012,000,000 out- of the above sum.   We will endeavouto provide this amount.in New York,  although it is not possibleto give an undertaking as to the precise dates of paymentpending &quot;more definite arrangBments with the United StatesTreasury for July,         As regards the balance of $52,000,000 we have there-fore no means of payment except gold.  Our gold resouroes,however, have now sunk to such a low level that the&apos;wholeamount available is required for payments outside the Empire.His Majesty&apos;s Government greatly regret that they cannot con-template disbursing in Canada their  final reserves, which,, asthe Canadian Government will appreciate, must be kept in handfor urgent necessities in foreign countries.         There is thus no alternative to provision of abovebalance from Canada&apos;s own resources.,  As $10,000,000 isrequired not for new expenditure but to repay loan from Bankof Montreal,-perhaps this Bank may be persuaded to ranew.05,000,.000 is for Interest.  : We suggest that this, be setoff against sterling sums due to British Government fromCanadian Government or postponed for the present.   Deductingthese items there remains a sum of 01?,000,000 requiringfinance during July.  His Majesty1s  Government earnestly hopethat Canadian  Government vail find  some means to providethis sum, either by further bank loans or by issue ofadditional currenoy notes.  As regards the latter expedient,Sir Thomas White informed Sir H,Lever on the 1st June lestthat he felt great difficulty in increasing his note issuewithout jold or Bank of England notes behind it.   The same &quot;&apos;objection holds good, however, against any such arrangementas against the  actual release of gold at Ottawa, as theerieot on British gold reserves is the same.   We appreciatebir Thomas White1s natural reluctance in this matter and how&apos;necessary financial prudence is in Canada&apos;s position.  But a
-2-etage of the war has &quot;been reached, vihen, -however regrettably,it is necessary to take risks.  It is for the Dominion.Government to vaigh the disadvantages of the course of actionv/e now urge upon them with the effect on the supply of munit-ions of the British Army and the.loss and confusion in whichCanadian manufacturers would he involved .if the ImperialMunitions Board were not.in a position to meet its liabilities.        The above applies equally to funds required to financepurchases of cheese and other commodities for    War Off iceand Board of Trade effected through Dominion Government Depart-ments.  &apos;                                           \  ..... Please urge on Dominion Government that the abovesuggestions are only put forward after most oareful consider-ation and in viev/ of the pressing necessities of the situation.L02M.
