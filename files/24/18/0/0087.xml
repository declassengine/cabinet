From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,                  4th July 1917.            .    l^H i^lw&apos;    Foreign Secret.   My telegrams of 29th March and  10th May.  Mesopo-tamian  administration.  In  pursuance of the policy  therein laid down bythem and for their guidance in settling questions which must arise from timeto time, His Majesty-s Government think it necessary that they should receiveregular and frequent information as to the political, and  economic  conditionof the territory and the establishment of civil institutions  and be  able tosatisfy themselves as to the progress made in  carrying out their policy.    They propose,  therefore, that the Chief Political  Officer shall be giventhe rank of Civil Commissioner in Mesopotamia, and  shall  in  that capacitysubmit reports on these matters at regular intervals  by  mail  and telegraphfor  their information.    The Army Council are strongly of opinion that in view of the presentmilitary situation, the. ultimate responsibility of  the  General  Officer Com-manding must remain unimpaired.  His Majesty&apos;s Government  concur,  andin giving the Chief Political Officer the status  of Civil Commissioner,  HisMajesty&apos;s Government do not propose  to set up  in the  occupied territoriesa civil administration independent of the military authority.   So long asmilitary conditions prevail, the General Officer Commanding, subject to  thecontrol of His Majesty&apos;s Government, is the ultimate seat of authority.  Tomake this clear, His Majestys Government propose that;* the reports  of  theCivil Commissioner should be submitted to me through  the General  OfficerCommanding, who will forward them with any observations which he may wishto make.  It  will be clearly  understood by both the Civil Commissioner  andthe General Officer Commanding, that His Majesty&apos;s Government desire thatthe opinion and advice of the Civil  Commissioner should be given freely .ancPto0the best  of his judgment in these reports.  As  by degrees normalconditions are re-established in parts of the territories, and the civil staff isincreased and strengthened,  it will be natural and desirable that &amp; largermeasure  of  independence  should be  conceded  in  civil affairs. to CivilCommissioner.    Copies  of the  Reports  and of  the General Officer  Commanding^observations would be forwarded to you.    Please  ascertain whether  Cox  would   be  prepared  to  accept  thisarrangement.
