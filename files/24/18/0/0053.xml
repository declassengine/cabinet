                                      Petrograd,                                         27th June,  1917Proia. Lt;* Colonel Blair.To   D,M.I.No. 1207.         An Army Order has &quot;been issued by Kerenski  saying thatdelegates from (a&apos; 2nd Caucasus Grenadier Division  had come toask him if it was necessary to carry out their Commander&apos;sorders regarding preparation for an offensive and asking  thatsuch orders should .fee issued by Kerenski himself.        . He.points out that the men of this division evidentlydo not understand their duty and it is quite impossible for himto give out orders to troops,.   He therefore orders that  allcommands issued by commanders are to fee carried out as if hehimself or the Provisional Government had issued  them andpoints out that refusal to obey an order on pretext of lack ofconfidence in a commander is a cowardly trick not worthy  of asoldier.   That the above order should have to be issued  showsplainly the present state of the- army.         In Helsingfors Bolsheviki are carrying on  a veryvigorous campaign and have persuaded Soldiers and SailorsCommittees to pass resolutions against the Allies and Government,It is reported in the Press that Council of Workmen and SoldiersDeputies in Minsk have passed a resolution proposed byBolsheviki against an offensive.         The Ukrains have declared themselves independent.Reports of refusal of regiments to go to front come fromvarious places in interior of Russia.   The 2nd Caucasus Grenadier Division is in the  10th Army  on   the Russian Western Front,SECRET
                                         Petrograd.From Colonel 31&amp;ireo 1 0   AJ ^ Xix * J. *1206.          To-day is the last day on which demonstrations are for-bidden in compliance with order issued on Saturday by Council ofworkmen and soldiers1 deputies.  There are rumours that theBolsheviki and anarchists baulked of their armed demonstration- areplanning another.  The threat of disorders must continue so longas  the Government gives the Bolsheviki a free hand.          It is fairly certain that the real objective of thspresent Bolsheviki movement is an endeavour to prevent anoffensive^ and I am certain that any disorder here on a largescale would.spoil if not entirely stop an offensives          There are other elements at work also which may precipi-tate disorders,  iinraged at the harmful propaganda of theBolsheviki the better classes are now commencing to organiseinstitutions nominally for maintenance of order but which un-doubtedly also- have political aims.  These bodies are only inprocess of organisation but are sources of great danger as anyaction on their part will be immediately regarded as counter-revolution by the workmen and a. large part of the garrison.  Aconflict between these parties might quite v/ell begin a civil i?ar.          I am informed that on -June 30th the Franco-Russian, workswill be closed through want of raw material.  This will throw20,000 men out of work and it will be the first of several largeworks to close down.   This adds a further source of possibledisorder to those already mentioned.                  now  ..          There has/been a spell of some weeks of extraordinaryhot weather with no rain.  This if it continues will have a verybad effect on crops in northern and Southern Hussia.  All-Hussianconference of council of workmen and soldier deputies has passedresolution about the war to following effect.          &quot;The war must be brought to an end but not by completedestruction of one of the groups of powers at war*  A separatepeace or armistice is not admissible.  ;n international socialistassembly to be formed to ?/ork out terms of- peace.  Conventionswith Allied Governments to be re-examined.  Everything must bedone so long as war continues to increase fighting power of theRussian Army and to make it capable of offensive or defensiveoperations.  The question of an offensive must be decidedentirely from the standpoint of military and strategicalconsiderations&quot;.          The resolution proposed by the Bolsheviki was defeated.          The Cossack Conference passed a resolution expressingconfidence in the provisional Government.  This morning  erenskiattended a meeting of representatives of all units of the garrisonin  order to explain measures that had been carried out by WarMinistry since the devolution.  The feeling displayed at themeeting was very good and Bolsheviki who attended were shouteddown.  The representative of 1st Machine Gun Depot Regiment theworst unit here who spoke in opposition to the Government got avery had reception.  Kerenski leaves to-day for Kazan.  To-daycommences a series of displays of our war cinematograoh filmsarranged for units of the garrison.- SECRET*
