Correspondence &quot;between the- Chancellor .of the Exchequer.                     ciii olio Secretary, War Cabinet:.   ..                 (l)    .  .Copy of letter dated 13th June 1917 from Secretary,    War Cabinet to the Chancellor of the ExcheYjer.Bear Mr.Bonar Law,          For some time I have been.seeking an opportunity  tobring before the War Cabinet the Interim Report of Sir  JosephCompton Ricketts&apos; Committee on the War Expansion of PublicDepartments.  (War Cabinet Paper G.T.644 herewith).   Thesubject has several times been on the Agenda Paper, but owinjg &apos;.to the groat pressure of business it has hitherto, never beenpossible to discuss it,.          I have seen the Secretary of the Committee, Mr.Pinsent,and I gather from him that up to now there has  been ho pressurefrom the Chairman or Members to get a decision  on the point.Nevertheless, I do not, feel comfortable at having a subject, somany weeks before.the War Cabinet without any action whatsoeverhaving been taken.          On studying the Report carefully it appears to ma toconcern the Treasury more than any other Department.-   AlthoughI could throw a little light on the earlier recommendations ofthe Report dealing with the relations between the National  ServiceDepartment and the Ministry of Labour, since this question  was,very recently inquired Into by Lord Milner and Mr.Henderson, 1have come to the conclusion that it would not be proper for meto offer any comment on a matter which certainly concerns the .Treasury much, more than the War Cabinet Secretariat.          I suggest for your consideration that the Treasury shbuldbe aSked to advise as to what action,  if any,  is to be taken inregard to the Report before it is brought before the  War Cabinet.I need hardly say that if I can assist anyone in the  Treasury whois dealing with this subject by information as to Lord Milnerfsand Mr.Henderson&apos;s inquiries,  I 3hall be only too glad to do so.                           Yours sincerely,                              (signed) M.P.A.  HAHKEY.  .                     (ID    Copy of letter dated 27th June,  1917,  from PrivateSecretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the Secretary,                     War Cabinet.Dear Hankey;          The Chancellor has asked me to write to you in regardto the Interim  report of Sir Joseph Compton-Ricketts1 Committee
which as you know was referred to him for consideration, andto say that he is not in a position to deal himself with thelarger questions with which the report is concerned, Tiz.proposals that the National Service Department should be mergedin the Ministry of Labour and that the Minis try of Labourshould be the only authority for dealing officially with tradedisputes.                      Yours sincerely,                          ( Signed \  H. P. Hamilton.
