Army Councila report on the present situation.in. Ireland from the GeneralOfficer, Commanding-in-Chief, the Forces  in  IrelrS&amp;dv:      It will be seen from this rep ortthat the condition ofIreland Is&apos;&quot; fair from satisfactory and that disturbance may belooked for at any moment.   It seems clear, therefore., that&apos;iSie &apos;hands of the ; General. Officer,&apos;. Commanding-in-Chief, the Forcesin Ireland require strengthening if&apos;he is to be in a positionto deal with local incidents which may lead to more extendedtrouble.                                I am, etc.Secretary,nm OFFICE.(SgdJ FRENCH       . . FIELD-MARSHAL,C0MMAHDIHG-UI-CH3EF,/ HOMEFORCE.II.HEADQUARTERS, IRISH COMMID,     PARKGATS, DUBLIN. &apos;        25th June,1917G./&amp;559/1GENERA HEADQUARTERS,     HOME &quot;FORCES, HORSE GUARDS,          WHITEHALL, S,^.      Whilst I ran fully aware of the present Policy of theGovernment with regard to Ireland,  the recent demonstrations&apos; towelcome the return of the released rebels have been marked bya display ef disloyalty raid spirit of insurrection of such anature as to have,  in my opinion,  a disturbing effect on the
peace of the country. It is with this consideration that I am primarily concerned, and I therefore, consider that the existing state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue unrestricted without increasing the risk of trouble. 

In addition to many other unsatisfactory indications, several cases have recently been reported to me of abuse and hostile demonstrations being levelled against the Troops in Dublin when proceeding on their normal duties through the streets. Every effort has been, and is being made, to avoid a ? between the populace and the Troops, but, if the present lawless spirit is allowed to remain unchecked, I fear a situation may be created which will render a collision unavoidable.

The practice of wearing Irish Volunteer uniforms is increasing, and bodies of men have on several occasions  during the past few days, been marching about in regular formation both in Dublin and in the country.

The chief factors in the organisation of the last rebellion were the unrestricted meetings that were allowed to take place. Those that have recently been held ? be justified on the grounds of amnesty to the rebels, but the difficulties in the way of prohibiting meetings increases as time goes on when once a precedent for them has been established, and this must be borne in mind; also the tendency amongst some sections of the community to encroach upon privileges. Therefore, I consider that by the continuance of them the possibility of disturbance is increased.

I am aware that to suppress these meetings end demonstrations at the present time would be at variance with the policy of conciliation, and realise that a certain risk of disturbance must be taken in consequence. I do not apprehend being unable to ? any rebellious outbreak which might arise from the existing state of affairs, but wish you to know that the present position has intensified the risk of such en outbreak.

This letter is not intended in any way to criticise the policy of the Government, but is merely to inform you of the situation from the Military point of view. I am sending a copy of it to the Chief Secretary.
