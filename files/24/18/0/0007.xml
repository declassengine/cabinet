The principal Papers on the subject  that have been circu-lated to the War Cabinet are:-       (a)  A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for           India on &quot;Indian Reforms&quot;,  dated May 22,1917,           (G.T.-822)  to which was attached a Memorandum,           prepared in the India Office, examining more           fully the Government of Indians proposals.       (b)  &quot;Indian Reforms.1?,&apos; a Note by  Lord Curzon,  dated           June 27, 1917 (G.T.-1199),   The question was raised by  the Indian Government  in theirdespatch dated November 24,  1916 (Ho.17 of 1916). The despatchstated that the proposals which commended themselves to thatGovernment  fell into several categories, and they Were accord-ingly treated under the following separate heads:-       (a)  Rewards and recognition of distinguished  ser-           vices rendered.

(e)  The difficulties  to be surmounted in the  ad-           vanoe.
   The Secretary of State for  India assemble. ,d.aJDe part mental-OomfttEtrtee^to report on the above  despatch, and&quot;the  Committeepresented their Report on the  16th&quot;Maroh last.          (Neither the despatch nor the  Report hag  been           generally oirculatedj  but liv  Chamberlain,  in           his Memorandum, of the.. 23nd Ultimo, stated  that           copies would be sent to any member of the  Cab-           inet who i-iight wish to see them.)   The thesis is that a demand for Home  Rule  in  India is nowserious and insistent, and:that some concession  must  be madeto it without delay.   The. Russian Revolution, India&apos;a share  in the  War,  professedlyfought to.vindicate the right  to  self-government, the flatteringreception accorded to Indians  Delegates to the&quot; Imperial War  .Cabinet.and Conference, furnish arguments which  are embarrassingin their nature. and, logically, not;easy  to meetv   The Government&apos;s silence is misunderstood, and favours mis-chief.  Moderate opinion is being seduced by  extremists, andsome general statement of policy is urgently,  required.  .   The Government of India and the Secretary of State have some-whatdifferent views as to the concrete, action to be  taiten,  anda decision of the far Cabinet  is  required. :-:THE GOVERNMENT  OF  INDIA PROPOSE   In order to correct  aisapprehen-eions about constitutional and ad-ministrative changes  due  after theWar.,  to publish a  statement to theeffect that   (i) The goal In prospect is self-       government ,  on no  theoretic       or borrowed model,  but  in       suoh form as may result from  .   &apos;  the course  of  time  and  local-V     evolutionary process.   &quot;Progress towards.that goal     -  must be gradual, and depends       on diffusion, of  education,      /softening of racial and re-      - ligiousdifferences, and       -acquisition of political ex-       perienoe.            ,.  (il) An immediate advance is tobe made by   (a) Increased powers for Locali       Boards and Councils made  -       predominantly  non-official       and elective,  based on an ...       extended franchise. -(b) Inoreased proportion of    Indians, in the  higher bpanr.    ches of the Public  Service. ORITieiSM  of PROPOSALS by  THE    ;  SECRETARY OP  STATE.(i)   Statement of goal is far too  formal and elaborate, and un- ; likely to meet acceptance in  any quarter.&apos;&apos; If such a state-  ment is necessary, the less  formal it is the betterIt  should be accompanied by a clear  indication that His Majeety&apos;s  Government must be the. judge of  the time and&apos; measure of each  advance.(ii)(a)  General accord,  but a system of  external control, analogous to the  Home pffice and the Local Govern-  ment. Board in this country, should . be worked &quot;out, and a permanent ,,service of local officials pro- &apos;yide4*&apos;:&quot;&quot;(b)  Agree.
THE GOVERNMENT OF, INDIA PROPOSE:^(o)  Increase  in the  elected  e&amp;ement    In Provincial Legislative  Coun-    oils.,  and expansion of constit-    uenoies returning members,  s6    as to  make the Councils  repre-    sent more interests and  fit thai:    for greater constitutional    powers in the future.  OKtPIOISM of PROPOSALS bv TEB       SECRETARY OF STATE.   .(o)  The defect of the Councils is    not lack of elected members,    but their lack of authority    and responsibility in any    department of government.    Hence they are, in the main,    a body 0f unreasonable and    unhelpful critics.  Multi- .    plication of such critics    is no advance towards self-    government.   Devolution of    power and responsibility is    the desideratum.  GOVERNMENT OP INDIA Off THE       0PUNTER PROPOSAL.   The experience  of  the  PublicServioes Commission makes  theGovernor-General&apos;s Council ear-nest ly deprecate the  idea  ofanother Commission, especiallyif it goes to India to takeevidence.   The question is not one offact, but of policy,  and  it isfor His Majesty&apos;s  Governmentto:decide.COUNTER PROPOSAL.   A Committee or Commission toexamine the Government of India&apos;sproposals-and take evidence onthem, with direction to enquireinto the working of the Councilsunder the Mor ley-Mint&apos;o oonstitu-tion, and to make suggestions.Whitehall Gardens,  3.?., June 28, 1917.
