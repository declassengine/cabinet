   MinistereDE  LA  GUERREREPUBLIQUE  FRANCAISE4bis, Boulevard des Invalides,           PARIS.             29th June, 1917.Dear General,            I think the morale of the French Army iscertainly improving.   The men are alright in spite ofthe undoubted fact that the Nation and the Army are bothweary of a very long War.     The Army cannot however be said to be;perfectly yalright yet, although there is every chance of thesituation going on improving.  That it is as good as itis, is almost certainly due to the fact that extremelysevere measures;have on the whole been taken.   TheMilitary Leaders stood no nonsense, and Court Hartialssat continuously for a long period.     Parliament is of course thinking that the measuresof suppression were&apos;too severe, and there is.a tendencyon the part of the Government to relax the measurestaken,. i.e. at first it enly took 4 days between thetime a man was condemned to death and the day of hisexecution;&apos; now there Is a great more delay and theGovernment is no longer sanctioning capital punishments.     I believe the Army, feels that It is quite necessarythat strong measures should continue, to be taken,  butMajwr-General P.Maurice,  C.B.,      Director of Military Operations,           War Office,               LONDON,  S.W.1,these/
these measures are of no avail if nothing is done inthe Interior,  that is if the  Government alltw thepublication of revolutionary  pamphlets and allowagents to spread dissatisfaction btth in the Army andin the ctuntry.   Such measures are all the morenecessary in France as it would be quite impossibleto suppress riots with machine-guns.     The conclusion therefore can be that althoughthe present danger is past the root of the trouble hasnot yet been eradicated and will not be until theFrench Government actually take the severest measures;for instance,  a paper which has just been publishedcalled &quot;le Pays&quot;, financed by Mr. Caillaux and whichhas strong pacifist tendencies, should not be allowedto continue on the lines at present adopted.     I know a good many Frenchmen think that theBritish Government should bring pressure to bear uponthe French to take these measures in their own inter-est and in that of the Allies.                          Ycurs sincerely,                              (Sd.)   E.L.  Spiers.
