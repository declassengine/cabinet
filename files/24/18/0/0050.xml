ligence Bureau,Department of Information,.        CRW/011.     July 2,  1917.The -Pos itIon of  the Government.     During the  past week the Government has successfully weatheredthe most serious storm that has  arisen since the beginning of May,The new Socialist Ministers were put to a severe test, hut thanksto the loyal support of the C.W.S.D. they succeeded in averting whatmight have soon  developed into anarchy.  It is worth while examiningwhat elements both to the Right  and the Left threatened to upset thestability of the Government, and what influences they may exertin the future.     The difficulties of the Government are caused partly by thohostility of the extreme Socialists and partly by the refusal ofthe bourgeoisie  to sink their party differences and give their-full support to  the only Government now possible in Russia.According to recent evidence nearly all the parties to the Rightof the Cadets,  including some of the latter, have been turningtheir thoughts more and more to  the idea of a counter-revolutionthat would overthrow the C.W.S.D. with the help of the Cossacks.Mr Rodzyankofs letter to members of the Duma, telling them toremain; in Petrograd and be prepared for eventualities was followedby the meeting of the Cossack regiments, in which members of theDuma played a prominent part. How far their threats would have beencarried out wb^rf it came to the  point it is difficult to judgebut it is clears that the C.W.S.D. thought it wise to take the bullby the horns and dissolve the Duma.   This would not have been donewithout some pretty cogent reason, as it is net in the interestsof the present Government, which is trying to steer a middle course,to stir up snyj passions unnecessarily.     The dangers to which the action of the discontented bourgeoisie
                             2.exposed the country during the  last week were shown by the courseof events.   The  immediate  result was a recrudescence of anarchistagitation.-   i^r^wer^^^several.  causes urging the Leninites to makea bid for power  (e.g. their loss of prestige as the result of theGrimm episode),  but the  discontent of the bourgeoisie and their talkof violence apparently inspired the Extremists with the hope thatin a fresh  upheaval they might  find the very opportunity theydesired of  destroying the  only  Government that has a chance ofgradually restoring order.  Moreover, the strong support that theAll-Russia  Congress of.C.W.S.D.  was giving the Government was anotherreason for  striking quickly.The Immediate  Future.     In spite  of their victory  last week the Government, supportedby the C.Yf.S.D., have an extraordinarily difficult time ahead.Unsupported by the  bourgeoisie  as  a whole and attacked by theextreme Socialists  they are faced with a financial and Industrialcrisis and  a growing separatist tendency in Finland and the Ukraine.To cope with the financial crisis  they will have to introduce heavydirect taxation  without delay and appropriate war profits unsparingly.A forced loan  may also be  necessary as the Government cannot look toforeign loans  with  the country In its present unsettled state.The industrial crisis requires  very careful handling, as the demandsof the workmen,  though excessive,  are really due to high pricesand lack of food.  There is also a strong feeling that under theold regime  profiteering on a grand scale continued unchecked.The workmen are  the biggest organised body in the country andcannot be silenced  either  by force or reasoning;  it Is onlyinstant legislation that is likely to allay the unrest whichis particularly  acute in the South.
                             3.      The  introduction of drastic legislation&apos;may have the effect of(alienating the industrial classes  still  further.-  It may even leadIto the resignation of the remaining bourgeois Ministers, leaving11  purely -Social 1st Government.  This would be unfortunate., as itWuld give the Government a  class  rather than a national character. A Socialist Government would appear to be the natural development if a  purely labour body such as the Congress  of C.W.S.D. succeeds&quot;in forming itself into a kind of Provisional  Parliament until the meeting of the Constituent Assembly  in October.      The most hopeful sign is the  presence of the All-Russia Congress  of C.W.S.D. and its readiness to support the Government. The latter is already showing greater firmness in dealing with the Anarchists and Socialist Maximalists that compose the Extreme Left/ end the gulf between Moderates, and Extremists is growing, wider week: by week.  This is all to  the  good,  as it clears the air and forces the Moderates to give their ideas greater precision abandoning general phrases.1 The Attitude of the Jews.      The  Jews are at the present time exercising very considerable influence in Russia, so much so that the agents of the Reactionaries are already accusing them of running the country in their own interests and not in the interests of Russia.   The Jewish leaders are well  aware of this danger and  ever since  the Revolution have been  on their guard against  making themselves too prominent. Their prominence/however^ Is unavoidable,  because owing to their intelligence and ability they are&apos;naturally singled out as leaders.      It may safely be said that the vast majority of the politicallyConscious Jews are Social Democrats, though there is a sprinkling of Jews among the Social Revolutionaries and  a strong, body of Jews led by Mr Vinavcr in the 0adet party.  The  reason that very -few
I                              - &apos;1. .    -: jews are associated with the Social Revolutionary party is  that the latter is essentially a peasant party and, with  the  exception of the Kherson settlements, the Jews have never been peasants  in Russia.  Nevertheless there have been prominent  Jews in the party, and Mr Kerenski himself is in close touch and  sympathy with the jews.   Among the Social Democrats the Jews for  the  most part belong to the Minimalists5.  the specifically Jewish Socialist organisation the Bund had, however, little to do with the differences between Minimalists and Maximalists.  But since the Revolution these differences have. become so acute that the Jews have  had to  take sides.  Although it is true that there are prominent Jews among the Maximalists, yet the majority of the Jewish  leaders belong to the Minimalists.  This can be illustrated by the fact that  at the recent elections to the Central Committee of the Minimalists out of 17 members 8 were Jews.  Martov, also a Jew,  was  not elected because he belonged to the extreme wing of the Minimalists  that refuses to support the Coalition Government;  on the other  hand,. Leo Deutsch was excluded for being too &quot;militarist&quot;. .  Again in the- Labour Section of the C.W.S.D. there are 12 Jews of  whom 9  belong to the Right wing; i.e. supporters of the Coalition  Government.     In view of these facts it seems inevitable,  that the Socialist elements in the new Coalition Government should  rely very largely upon the support of the Jews.  Any attempts to discredit the  Jews as a body will probably come from the reactionary Right,  who  are now proving as big a thorn in the side of the Government as  the Extreme Left.  In view of the approaching financial  crisis  it would be sheer madness for the Government to alienate  the Jews, and those who try. to promote dissensions between Jews  and Russians at the present moment are not doing a good service either to Russia or the Allied cause.                            -          .    .
