Registered Telegraphic A ddress;   &quot;GROWMORE, SOWEST,    Telephone: VICTJSir,1BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES,   FOOD PRODUCTION  DEPARTMENT,              72, VICTORIA STREET,                      LONDON, S.W.  1.                  4th  July,  1917.        I beg  to  submit the following Report of the  Pood ProductionDepartment for the week ended 3rd July:-                        LOCAL ORGANISATION          Work of the Agricultural Executive Committees.        The  following are instances of action taken  with regard tospecific pieces of land:-Rutland - Exton Park, extending  to 900 acres has been Inspected byone of the Technical Advisers of the Department, who has recommendedthe ploughing  up  of a considerable portion.   The  Committee aretaking action  to  give effect to  the recommendations  made.Suffolk, East  - The Committee have been authorised to take possessionof derelict  farms of 142 acres at Grundisburgh and 70 acres at Burghwhich they propose to cultivate  themselves, and of another derelictfarm of 143  acres at Peasenhall,  of which they propose to let partsand to cultivate&apos;  the rest.Surrey - The Executive Committee have arranged for the cultivationof lands forming  the cultivable  portions of Gatwick  and LIngfieldrace courses.Sussex, East.- Possession has been taken of 4 farms  at Whatlingtonand Mountfield, all in the same  ownership and amounting to 168acres.   None  of  the arable land on these farms had  been cultivatedfor two years  and no use had been made of any of the buildings.The Committee  have also taken possession of 22 acres of worn outpasture at Clayton Holt which the owner-occupier refused to breakup.
Glamorgan -The Committee have been authorised to take possession of10 acres of land at Khoose and of 50 acres of glebe land at Marcrossand are letting these lands to efficient tenants.              Use of Golf - Courses for Food Production.          Three months ago the golf clubs of the country werecircularised ?/ith the view of ascertaining to what extent thegolf courses were being used for the purpose of increasing thefood supply,, and in order to stir up the less enterprisingclubs to make some effort in that direction.          Out of about 1,200 clubs addressed on the subject, some300 replied, and their reports showed that the majority wereco-operating in a greater or less degree in the task of increasingfood production, the most common form of action being to grazeeither cattle or sheep on the course.   A few clubs have suspendedplay altogether, and given up their grounds to agriculturalpurposes;   many clubs have closed portions of their grounds forhay, and where they have not the labour or appliances necessaryto harvest the crop, they have been put into communication withthe Forage Committee, who have arranged to do the work andpurchase the hay, if suitable for Army requirements.   Smallareas have, in some instances, been actually broken up andcultivated, either by the members of the club or by allotmentholders under the local authority, notably at Stockport inCheshire.    In the few cases where no action of any kind hasbeen taken, the reason given Is that the land is unsuitable forany form of cultivation.          Quite apart from the Board&apos;s enquiries, it is known thatmany Committees are giving special attention to the possibilityof cultivating golf courses.       This is notably the caseIn Surrey, where the Committee called a conference
of Club Secretaries, when a joint Committee was set up toconsider the best means of bringing cultivable courses intocultivation, and affording the dispossessed members playingrights on the other courses.   Careful enquiries by the SurreyCommittee showed that about 700 acres of the courses in thatcounty are capable of cultivation, of which only a negligibleportion Is at present under crops.          The Lancashire Agricultural Executive Committee hasalso given the matter special consideration, and has instructedthe various Clubs that the mowing of the fairways must be stopped,and that the lands must be fully stocked with sheep and cattle.The Committee are considering whether to take more drastic actionas regards the cultivation for 1918, but have been cautioned bythe Department to bear in mind the possibility of heavy claimsfor compensation if golf courses are ploughed by their directions.Procedure on the same lines as in Surrey has been recommended tothe Lancashire and Birmingham Committees,          The Hampshire Agricultural Executive Committee arearranging for the cultivation of the course of the BrockenhurstClub, which was arable land until recently, and also for thegrazing of sheep on the course of the North Hants Club,          As stated in the Report for the 19th June, it has beenarranged to plough and cultivate 87 acres of the CambridgeUniversity&apos;s course at Coton.               Determination of Tenancies,-.          In the report for the week ending 22nd May, 1917, itwag stated that the landlords had been authorised to determinetenancies in 44 cases..   The total number of cases in which thelandlord has been authorised to determine the tenancy now amountsto 81, and the Board have themselves determined in 4 cases, inwhich for special reasons it was not found appropriate to authorise
the landlord to do so.   In practically all these cases it hasbeen found possible, upon the determination of the tenancy, toarrange for the entry of a new and efficient tenant.   The abovefigures are independent of cases in which the Committees havetaken possession of land.               Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917, (No.2).         Reports from 14 Boroughs or Urban Districts have broughtthe total number of reports to 985,   In these districts 182,696plots have been provided containing a total area of 12,292 acres.                  HORTICULTURAL SECTION.         Twenty Horticultural Representatives have been appointedduring the week, bringing the total up to 624.   Notificationhas been received during the week of the formation of 9 furtherPood Production Societies, making a total of 101.Fruit Bottling. The number of bottles for which orders havebeen received during the week is 313,812, making a total of738,408.   The number of bottles despatched during the week is54,180, making a total of 78,588.         The Ministry of Munitions has experienced greatdifficulties in obtaining delivery of bottles from the manufacturerThe deliveries effected so far are one-tenth of those which themanufacturers undertook to make.   Expressions of discontent withthe slowness of delivery have been received from various quarters,principally Devonshire.   Every.effort has been and is beingmade to speed up delivery and an improvement is promised duringthe coming week.         A deputation of representatives of trade organisationsconnected with the distribution of bottles waited upon theHorticultural Division on Wednesday in order to. express its viewson the hardships to retail traders alleged to have been causedby the action of the Department in supplying bottles at a low
price.  The deputation was assured that the Department woulddo its utmost to assist retailers to obtain supplies of bottlesand would also be prepared, when its present engagement tosupply two million bottles was complete, to entrust further distribution to the- retail trade - subject to a reasonable pricebeing charged by retailers.          Forty Travelling Instructors in Fruit Bottling arenow at work holding demonstrations in different parts of thecountry, and in addition to these, training has been providedfor 28 voluntary Instructors, who are undertaking to givedemonstrations in the neighbourhood of their homes.          Sanction of the Treasury having been received, themanufacture of 400 canners has been ordered.  Unless, however,the Ministry of Munitions releases tinplate for the manufactureof cans, the use of these canners will be seriously restrictedowing to the fact that although they are useful for bottling,the number of cans they can deal with in a given time is muchlarger than the number of bottles.Potato Spraying. Number of machines for which orders have been                   received 663,. making a total of 6,678Number of cases of chemicals for which orders have been                   received 2,465, making a total of 31,489.Number of machines despatched by manufacturers, 1,315                   making a total of 3,771.Humber of cases of material despatched, 3,-946,. making a total                   of 27,218.          In order to meet the great demand for KnapsackSprayers, 500 Trench Farfare Machines have been acquired andare being adapted.   Further outbreaks of disease of lateblight are reported, one in Pembrokeshire and one in Cornwall..
Preservation of Vegetables and Fruit.  The sanction of theTreasury for part of the scheme submitted for the drying offruit and vegetables has now been received, and preparations forthe installation of drying and pulping stations are in progress.A number of Oast houses in Kent have been inspected, and it hasbeen decided to complete the equipment of the drying plantalready installed at the Agricultural College at Wye.                       TECHNICAL DIVISION.Utilisation of. Straw. A Committee has been formed to considermethods by which the expected surplus of straw in 1918 can bemost economically disposed of. Preliminary experiments havebeen arranged to test the value for feeding or manure of strawtreated (1) chemically, (2) by a process of fermentation.  Theindustrial uses of straw will also be considered, and it isproposed to make an enquiry of paper manufacturers, etc.,-toascertain the extent to which straw might be used for the makingof coarse paper and strawboard.Milk.  A report has been prepared on an enquiry addressed to 45Medical Officers of Health in cities, boroughs and urban districtswith regard to the milk supply.  Forty-four replies were received,and useful information has been obtained as to the number of cowsmaintained within the respective areas, the present and prospectivemilk supply, the minimum quantity essential, and the extent towhich liquid milk could be replaced by dried or condensed milk.A memorandum based on this enquiry has been submitted to theCommittee on the Production and Distribution of Milk, of whichMajor Astor is the Chairman.Plant Diseases. There are now 26 honorary correspondentssubmitting monthly reports on plant diseases,   Frequent reports arereceived as to the damage by insect pests to cereal crops.  Duringthe week enquiries with regard to nearly 100 cases of pest  attackshave been received; . specimens, have been identified, and advice
given as to treatment. The attention of honorary correspondentshas &quot;been drawn to the importance of obtaining full details  asto the prevalence of pests on newly broken grass land.                            LABOUR.Harvest Labour.  The soldiers provided by the Military Authoritiesfor the hay and corn harvests are being well taken up at most ,.ofthe distribution centres^ and in some counties all the men  arenow out and more are required.  In a few counties, notably  Bedford.Suffolk and Hunts, farmers have refused to pay the minimum  rateof wage laid.down for the hay harvest (namely, 5,/- a day &quot;livingout&quot; or 2/6 a day &quot;living in&quot;) although the &quot;living-in11 rate isthe same as that fixed last year. &quot;The &quot;living-out&quot; rate is anincrease of 1/- a day on last year, and is reasonable in viewof the increased cost of living.  In a few cases complaints havebeen made as to the quality of the men now available.          The Military Authorities have agreed to a reduction inthe minimum rate to  4/2 per day living out*or 1/3 a day living inwhilst these soldiers are engaged on general farm work in theinterval between the hay and corn harvests.          Estimates now being received from Committees indicate. :that many more men will be required for the corn harvest, andenquiries have been made of the National Service Department as towhether they can supply them from civilian sources.Prisoners of War.   TBO new schemes for the employment of batchesof prisoners of war have.been sent to the. War Office during theweek, bringing the number of schemes under consideration by the WarOffice up to 15. In the case of three of the schemes alreadystarted, the War Office has been requested to send additional men.          Lists received from the Home Office shew that over 1,000civilian prisoners of war have now been released for agriculturalwork.Horses.   The Government having decided that a number of soldiersare to be Immediately made available for the 1918 Programme, theWar Office have been asked whether they can supply the horses
required to carry out the scheme.  As it has been ascertained thatonly a limited number can at present be obtained from the Army,it will.be necessary for the Department to purchase the remainderof the horses required,  and application is accordingly being madeto the Treasury for the  necessary authority.          Representations have been received on the subject of theSale of Horses Order, chiefly by interests concerned with horsebreeding, or by auctioneers and dealers who fear that the Order willinterfere with their trade by giving extra facilities to theMilitary Authorities, for commandeering horses for the Army.  Theadvantage of the Order will be more clearly realised byagriculturists when purchase on behalf of the Department for the1918 Programme is commenced.                           WOMENfS BRANCH.          The total returns of National Service Volunteers showthat 5,125 have been accepted and 7,617 rejected.  Of thoseaccepted 5,010 are accounted for as follows:-In Instruction Centres       1582On Training Farms             411In employment ofi Farms       2446Waiting complete acceptance  before entering Training  Centres       &quot;        &quot;     377Waiting for employment in  Depots                       53Waiting in their own homes    141                       MACHINERY AND  IMPLEMENTS.;.            There are no further deliveries  of tractors  or  ploughs   to report.                                       -            An analysis of the reports from  Tractor Representatives   for the week ending June 23rd shows that 396 tractors  ploughed   3,682 acres, and cultivated 1,033 acres during  the week.  The   returns from the remaining tractors are not yet  to hand.            The Ministry of Munitions have been informed that &apos;^  implements for use with horses will.be ultimately required as follows            Ploughs     8,000       Harrows        5,500            Cultivators 2,000       Land Presses    400            Drills      2,000       Self-Binders   7,000            Rollers     2,750      ,o
                        :  SUPPLIES.Sulphate of Ammonia. Large scale experiments are being conducted by  .the Ministry of Munitions on the use of nitre cake in place ofsulphuric acid in the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia.  Thesulphate of ammonia produced by this process is of a lower qualitythan the normal product, but the Department are advised that it isquite suitable for agricultural purposes.  In view of the need forsaving tonnage by reducing the importation of raw materialsrequired for the manufacture of sulphuric acid, the Department isbound to concur in the use of nitre cake although the administrativedifficulties consequent on the sale of this new product at adifferent price will be considerable. Some two or three months will,however, elapse before the experiments are concluded.  Meanwhileorders for ordinary sulphate are being placed very freely with makers.Basic Slag,  The question of grinding low grade slag has beendiscussed with the Ministry of Munitions&apos;.  In one case some30,000 tons will be ground at a works where conditions areespecially favourable, at a cost which will enable it to be soldon the prevailing unit basis, but it does not seem practicable togrind this type of slag on a large scale except at a cost soheavy as to make the selling price prohibitive.Potash. The Ministry of Munitions are now taking active steps with *                             .....                        -a view to the production of potash from Blast Furnace (Flue) Dust,and there are good prospects of.a moderate supply being availablefor next yearls crops. In the meantime arrangements will be madefor the distribution of the raw flue dust in agricultural districts.The Ministry also speaks hopefully of other processes not as yetfully developed.Feeding Stuffs. A Committee to advise as to the distribution ofoil-cake has been constituted with the concurrence of theController of Oils and Fats.  This Committee includes represen-tatives of all the Departments&apos; concerned, and will in the first
 instance consider1 what steps are necessary to ensure that sufficient supplies are reserved for the winter feeding of cous.      The control of the distribution of milling offals Is also receiving attention,  and negotiations are on foot with the Ministry of pood as to the  appointment of a Committee to deal with this subject. Seed Wheat.  A considerable number of offers of samples of seed wheat of the 1916 crop are being received by the various Purchasing Committees, and in many  districts parcels have been purchased.      Arrangements have been made for the inspection of the crops of the selected varieties of 1917 wheat which have been offered to the Department for  purchase and the Selection Committee will begin its work on the 16th  July.   The offers received up to date account in all for 9,952 acres  of  standing crops. Provision of Sacks for the 1917 Harvest, Enquiries have been made from the Jute Controller and also from various merchants and sack-hiring firms throughout the  country regarding the supplies of corn sacks available for the 1917 harvest&apos;.   The reports indicate that there is no immediate cause for anxiety and that adequate supplies are likely to be forthcoming.* Seeds (other than Cereals).  It is now possible to indicate briefly the T*ork which has  been undertaken in regard to the supply of seeds (other than cereals) during the past few weeks.   The Advisory Committee at its first meeting decided that there were three directions in which the help of the Department was specially needed in order to enable merchants to meet the increasing demand.for seeds, namely (1)  .in the matter of securing the skilled labour necessary for the growing, cleaning and distribution of seeds;  (2) in arranging for Agricultural Executive Committees in the various counties concerned to encourage farmers to grow food crops for seed purposes by removing any restrictions which^are likely to hamper  them;  and (3)  by obtaining  preferential  treatment for the transport of  seeds grown abroad which are required for distribution in the:United Kingdom,   ,  .
          In accordance with these recommendations the followingsteps have been so far taken:-  (1) about twelve cases ofskilled men employed in the Seed Industry,, who had been calledup for military service, have been investigated, and, where thecase appeared to justify such a course, arrangements have, beenmade for the officer who had carried out the investigation to bepresent when the case was heard.  (2) An inspection of the chiefseed growing districts of Essex and Lincolnshire has beencarried out and the inspection of similar districts in othercounties is being undertaken, and the importance of securing asufficient acreage for the growth of seed is being broughtbefore the Agricultural Executive Committees concerned.  (3)Preferential treatment is being obtained for the transport ofconsignments of seed grown abroad but intended for use in the &apos;United Kingdom. .                         I am,                              Sir,                                  Your obedient Servant,      &quot;........*Mht,MDirector-General.The Rt,  Hon. Rowland E.  Prothero, M.P.   President of the Board of Agriculture                   and Fisheries.
