. III     111     &quot;.&apos;G.T.  1233      &apos;  -   :.                         WAS 0ABIH3T,                    OIL  FUEL  SITUATION.             Statement  by the Fourth Sea Lord.     Attached is a statement showing the forecast of theposition of stooks of Oil Fuel at Home and Abroad at theend of each month to 31st December, 1917.     The two principal difficulties in maintaining thesupply of Naval Oil Fuel have been(a) unexpected delays in the completion of oversea and          Fleet attendant oilers.  (It may be mentioned here          that the delay in the construction of oversea oilers          in the years 1915/16 caused a loss of over 500,000          tons of Oil Fuel.)(b) losses of oilers and damages to them inflicted by the          enemy.     The Increase in the expenditure of Oil Fuel is dueto(l)  increased activity of oil burning vessels necessary to          cope with enemy action,(2)  the increase in the number of H.M.Ships burning Oil .          Fuel.     In order to meet this very grave situation, thefollowing steps have been adopted.     The United States have been informed that it isessential that they should send over 200,000 tons of OilFuel by the end of August and a further 100,000 tons by theend of September; followed by a further 300,000 tons up tothe end of December.  These amounts are in addition to59,000 tone already promised by America.     So far, none of this Oil has been received.     Mr. Walter Long ie in constant communication withLord Korthcliffe and is pressing this matter most strongly.
      Thestops  taken this  side are  :-(1)  the hastening of all building and repairs  of oversea      oilers  and Fleet attendants.(2)  issue of  orders  strictly  limiting speed  of all  oil-      burning vessels of the  Fleet,  except in  the      gravest emergency and except In the Southern  pert      of the  North Sea.(3)  limitation of Fleet movements to the utmost possible      extent,(4)  formation of oilors in  convoys both  when on passage  to      and from United Kingdom and when on coasting      passage,(5)  esoort by Torpedo Craft of all oilers when in submarine      area,(6)  reduction of number of  oilers on Fleet service  to      lowest  possible limit,(7)  the importation  of Oil  Fuel in the double  bottoms  of      cargo steamers from America,(8)  the increase of  the production of Oil Fuel at home,      (This is in hand by the Uinistry of Uunitions but  the       immediate effect will  be small),Statement &quot;A&quot;  shows the forecast provided that no imprbve-      ment results from the  restriction of the consump^      tion of  Oil Fuel or from the  increased protection      of oilers.Statement &quot;B&quot;  shows the forecast allowing 30,000 tons per      month saving due to restriction of consumption of      Oil Fuel,Statement &quot;C&quot;  shows the forecast allowing for the saving      indicated in Statement &quot;3&quot; and also the saving      anticipated from the increased protection of      oilers.      The reduction in losses shown in Statement nC&quot;  isconjectural,  but it is anticipated that the  steps taken willmeet the emergency, even if the  losses are  on the higherscale shown in Statements &quot;A&quot; and &quot;3&quot;,      America has arranged for tonnage to convey about100,000 tons of fuel oil by the  end of September,(Initialled)   H.H.D.T,30th June,  1917,
