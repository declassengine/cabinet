4th July,  1917.DERBY.^J^if?;       I   SECRET.  Il/Stores/7310.                *   ^                         ^ar  Cabinet.        Manufacture of Motor Cars&apos; in the United States.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War                With reference to War Cabinet 163(15)  on the subject  of       the manufacture of Motor Cars in the United States, I have been       in consultation with the Minister of Munitions.   We are both       agreed that nothing further can be done with regard to the       manufacture of Aero Machines by the Motor Manufacturers.   The       two types manufactured do not now clash, and it  is essential that       the manufacture of Motors should still be continued in this       Country in order to supply the spare parts necessary for repair of       damaged machines in France.&apos;                We are, at the present moment, suffering very severely       in France from the fact that the workshops where a large quantity       of our motor lorries were made,  have now been transferred to other       work, with the result that we are extremely short of spare parts       and many machines are awaiting repairs.                The Minister of Munitions authorises me to say that he       entirely agrees with the above,  and in the circumstances has not       telegraphed as suggested by the  War Cabinet to Lord Horthcliffe.
