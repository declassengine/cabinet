^^^Hl       1111                             1113 B 0 R ST.           WAR CABINET.G.T. 1806-SITUATION AS REGARDS PRODUCTION Off  IRON                  OPE  IN THE UlITEP KINGDOM.               Memoranaua?. /by the Minister of Munitions.         (Circulated with reference  to War Cabinet  77, Minute 8,                        of  1st Fob. 1917.)          The new or modified blast furnaces are now, as antici-pated,  coming into blasts  and will continue to do so.          This shows the1 net result.Production of Basic  Iron from Home Ores.Average per week,  1st  Quarter, 1917..............   46,700 tons.Average for 11 weeks from  March 31st .............   51,50S tons.Production of last completed week 10.6.17 ........   53,931 tons.          More furnaces are coming in and the immediate forecastfor the coming fortnight is a further increase of at least1,400 tons per waek.   This will go steadily on.          The scheme is to increase the production of steel fromhome ores  (basic)  so that by May 1918 we shall be producing atthe rate of 1,863,160  tons of steel a&amp;aitional per annum.The rate of production of Basio Steel 1st Quarter  -SSft? i?er ag g5        1917,  was                                   3,741,448The rate of production of Basic Steel by        May 1918  will be about                       5,600,000          This is  more than I originally anticipated, and isequivalent to the  raising  of an additional 4,000,000 tons ofhome ore.    To be  added to this there is an increase from Cumber-land ores  (acid steel) which we aim a/t increasing, by the sametime, by a jrate of 390,000 additional tons of steel per annum.          The net  result if at the same time we can keep  up ourimports of Spanish ore wiX11)e to raise the steel output  of thecountry during 1917&apos;  and 1318 from a rate of 9,700,000 tons perannum to one of 18,000,000 tons per annum.
