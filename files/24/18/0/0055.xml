SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.DSW/003.AVffEEKLY REPORT ON SERBIA-&amp; MONTENEGRO.  Ill.July 2, 1917.      During the past month criee.3 have developed in both Serbian and Montenegrin internal politics, both of a stormy character and in the case of Serbia of considerable importance.   The outward and visible sign of this has been the recent change of Cabinet in both countries.  Failing full explanations of these events from trustworthy sources, all that is possible for the moment is to record the facts and call attention to some of the prevailing political tendencies. Cabinet Changes and Party Politics in Montenegro.      It was announced on June 4 that the Tomanovic Government had resigned &quot;as a sequel to a telegram of congratulation on the successes of the Italian Army addressed by the King of Montenegro to the King of Italy&quot;.  This brief statement seems to contain two important hints as to the real reason for the Cabinet&apos;s resignation.  Coming as it did almost simultaneously with the&apos; Italian proclamation - by General Ferrero at Argirokastrcn and by General Farro at Corfu on June 3 - it seems clear that not even the Tomanovi6 Government could tolerate such a direct slight to Montenegrin claims as the Italian proclamation did with its obvious inclusion of Shki\ocla (Scutari) in its scope.  King Nicolas&apos; own acquiescence Is no doubt due to other reasons, to be discussed  ? below.  Iveanwhile  on June 12 the fo_.rm.ation of a new Government                                        -x was announced with Mr Popovic - possibly  the same as was Civil     x-  There are four men of the name of Popovic prominent inMontenegro.   (1)  The former Civil Governor of Scutari, just referredto.  (2) General  Popovii,  new in hiding in Montenegro and proclaimedan outlaw by the  Austrian  authorities.  (3) Simo Popovii, formerlySecretary to the  King, and latterly&apos;much in his confidence.  (4) JovoPopoviA, also an  imtimate  of the King and reputed an Austrophil.The last two - Simo and Jovo Popovi6 - are both with King Nicolas inFrance and quite  possibly  it is one of them who is the new PrimeMinister.
Governor  of  Scutari during Montenegro&apos;s  tenure of the town - asPrime  Minister  and.Minister  of Foreign Affairs.   Mr Mile Vojnovidhecomes Minister  of Finance  and  Public Works;   Mr Veljko Militfevid(a young  novelist of doubtful character  and no political experience)Minister  of  Justice, Public  Instruction  and Cults;  and Mr NikoHajdukovic Minister of War and the  Interior.  The King is presumablyfor the time being able  to rely  on  the support of the new Ministry,for what  it  is  worth - which is  very little, as none of the newMinisters can be  said to represent  national opinion in the least.     There can  be little doubt that the  TomanoviC Government objectedto the attitude of the Montenegrin  Court towards the Italian Govern-ment.   Not  that  Dr Tomanovic himself (an old man and a mere creatureof King Nicolas)  or his  colleagues  would be willing to embark on astruggle  with the Court  on a question of principle.  But asopportunists they would  feel bound  to dissociate themselves fromKing Nicolas&apos; congratulations to the King of Italy on his victoryon the Isonzo over troops which,though Austrian in allegiance,werelargely Jugoslav  by race and were commanded by avBaimatri-an Serb,General Borojevic.  Italy&apos;s  recent  attitude towards the Jugoslavsand forward  policy in Albania have  aroused such strong resentmentamong Jugoslavs everywhere that  not even the Tomanovi6 Governmentcould be  prepared to take on themselves  the odium of continuingto serve  a King who had  expressed his sympathy with the Italians.The new Government are merely King  Nicolas1 men, and of little value.     It has  not yet been stated  v/hether  Dr Tomanovi6 and hiscolleagues will follow Dr Radovi rs party into the camp of outspokenopposition to King Nicolas,  his  dynasty, and the whole idea ofMontenegro&apos;s separate existence.  Dr Radovic and his followerscontinue  their  activities very vigorously in Geneva.  In Reporton Serbia, No.  2. this movement  for Jugoslav union was referred to.Since then the  first four numbers of their paper, Ujedinjenje (&quot;Union&quot;)
which appears every three weeks in Geneva, have come to hand.It is absolutely outspoken on what it calls nthe treacheryof King Nicolas and his entourage to the national causeIt says the time has come for Montenegro to throw in her lotwith the sister Jugoslav countries and work for a common,political,  economic and cultural future.  It points out that fora separate  Montenegro there is no further prospect of realpolitical independence or of the economic development sherequires.  The movement is, of course, in close touch with theJugoslav Committee of London, Paris and Geneva.Political Conditions in Serbia.     The Italian proclamation of &quot;Albanian independence&quot; is,of course,  not popular in Serbia.  The Serbian representativesin London,  Rome, Paris and Petrograd received Instructions torecord the protest of their Government against Italy&apos;s action.The Serbian Government desire to reserve the right of returningto the subject hereafter.   Meanwhile the political situationin Serbia is very critical.  On June 24 the followingresignations from the Cabinet were announced frem Corfu:Mr Ljubomir Davidovic (Public Instruction);  Mr Milorad Draskovi6(Public T/orks);  Mr Vojislav Marinkovi6 (Agriculture),  In con-sequence, the entire Ministry presented Its resignation to thePrince Regent, who, after consultation with the President of theSkupetina, accepted it and entrusted the Prime Minister, Mr Pasi6,with the formation of a new Government.  Mr Pasii retains theportfolio of Foreign Affairs, and his new colleagues areMr Stojan Proti6 (Finance and Vice-President of the Council ofState);  Mr Ljubomir Jovanovid (Interior);  Mr Marko Djuricic(Justice and temporary Minister of Agriculture);  Dr MonciloNlncii  (Public Works and temporaryj-linister of Public Instruction);and General Bozidar Terzi6 (War),.  The new Government is composed
entirely of members  of  Mr Pasi6fs  &quot;Old Radical&quot; party, and theCoalition of parties in Serbia has therefore broken down.   Therecan be little doubt  that one  cause of this is the discontentaroused by the military situation  in Macedonia.  The SerbianGovernment expressed considerable  alarm at the proposed politicalC0Up in Greece, as  they feared that the withdrawal of the forcesrequired for this would seriously  weaken the Macedonian f.^ont.The speedy and successful conclusion of M. Jonnartrs missionshould reassure them on this  point.  The Serbian army, after ayear!s fighting in Macedonia, has  now been so far reduced innumbers that a natural  feeling of  pessimism has arisen as to thesuccessful conclusion of the  campaign for the recovery of Serbia,and as to Serbia&apos;s Allies1  plans on this question.  Serbia hasnow (June 27) requested that  a Serbian delegate should be invitedto attend the impending Allied Conference to discuss the policyof the Allies in the Balkans.     Military failures  and the uncertain prospects of success inthe future, combined with old animosities against Mr Pasii and hispersonal regime, largely explain the rise of seditious movementsamong the officers  and men of the  army.  These movements havelately achieved notoriety through  the recent conspiracy trial,in which General Damian Popovic  and many other distinguishedofficers were involved.   Sentences of death were finally carriedout (June 26) on Colonel Dragutin^ Dimitrijevic, Major LjubomirVulovid,. and a Bosnian volunteer named Malobabii.  Severalheavy sentences of  imprisonment  were inflicted, General Popovicbeing condemned to  20 years hard labour.  The accusation was thatthese officers were  members of a secret &quot;Black Hand&quot; society,that they had attempted the life of the Prince Regent and hadconspired to overthrow the dynasty and the present politicalregime of Serbia,   it is not  stated whether reasons of international
 politics entered into the affair or whether the movement was solely directed against the Government of Mr Pasic.  That party politics must have played a considerable part in  the genesis of the conspiracy and its rigorous repression appears probable from the fact that the result of the passing of fcuch severe sentences on the condemned officers was the break up of the GpalitIon Government.  The political situation is serious, and unless striking military successes either on the Balkan front or elsewhere restore the waning confidence of the Serbian  army in complete final victory, it is to be feared that the movement for making peace on any terms will spread and that Austrian agents may be able to take advantage of the increasing pessimism of the Serbian soldiers. Serbia as a Bulwark against Central Europe.     In the Weekly Reports on Bulgaria attention has repeatedly&quot;N*en called to Bulgarian politicians&apos; aims on the Morava Valley, or at least so much of it as would secure Bulgaria&apos;s permanent contact with Hungary.  To put a better face on this purely Imperialistic move the Bulgarian Government has been hard at work Bulgarising the occupied departments of North-East Serbia, and lar Radoslavov in the last of three interviews he gave to Viennese newspapers (in all of which he alluded to the importance of retaining the Horava Valley) declared that this claim was not contrary to the Entente&apos;s principles of nationalities, since the occupied country was Bulgarian.     A wire sent by Sir W. Townley from The Hague on June 22 makes the conjecture that Tsar Ferdinand&apos;s visit to Berlin is concerned with the same plan.  Sir W. Townley learns that Hungary is agreeable to the plan, but that Austria objects because she fears that, if Hungary were geographically connected with

Townley learns that Hungary is agreeable to the plan, but that Austria objects because she fears that, if Hungary were geographically connected with
Bulgaria and. Turkey,  11 the three cousins might make common causeand support one. another politically,which would so strengthenHungary that she would tend to be leading partner in the DualMonarchy&quot;.   Sir W.  Townley is, of course, referring to the notoriouspan-Turarian movement based on the idea of the common Ural-Altaicorigin of the Magyars,  Bulgars and Turks.  This, as a workingpolitical theory, was developed some  18 months ago in Budapest andhas enjoyed great vogue in Sofia.  Hungarian propagandists haveindeed been far more  active in Bulgaria than Austrian, and thelatter may well feel  some of the misgivings that Sir T&apos;. Townleyalludes to.  Not that Austria objects to a territorial connectionof Central Europe with Constantinople through the Balkans *-is, in fact, vital  to her - but that  she hopes to achieve thisconnection through  the annexation or  attachment of Serbia by someloose political and strong economic bond to the Jugoslav provincesof the Habsburg Monarchy.  In other words, she would like to makethe connection a direct one between German Austria, the Jugoslavcountries and the Balkans, and one thus independent of Hungariancontrol.                                                 - A.W.A.L.
