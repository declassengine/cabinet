^  J     RELEASE  OF MM JOE MILITARY SERVICE.^-    (l) I wish to call attention to somo statements in theMemorandum by the Ad jut ant-General, l&amp;r Office,  which waslaid before the War Cabinet by the Secretary of State forWar on the 7th June, on &quot;the position and prospects of re-cruiting.n  These statements, I think, are unintentionallymisleading so far as they relate to the action of the Boardof Trade.     The statements occur in paragraph 9, 10 and 18 of theMemorandum dealing with the question of the release of menfor military service from (a) railways, (b) docks, (c) the     (2) (a) Bai.lways.    I am informed by the RailwayExecutive Committee that the 12,000 men referred to inparagraph 10 had all been released early in March, and that,of the additional 21,000 men referred to in the Table inparagraph 18.. 3.ISO were relea^Rr1 during March, 3,718 duringApril, and 3,298 during May, the total number released tothe end of lay  thus being 10,204 in addition to the 12,000already referred to.        (b)  Dock,s,-   It was arranged that the 7,000 menreferred to  in paragraph 18 should be furnished in four in-stalments of 1,750 men each during the months April to July.Owing to questions raised by the Ministry of Shipping, whichwere not settled until the 14th May,  the Board of Trade were.  :not able before that date to proceed with the release of dock &quot;workers,  and Lord Ehondda then undertook, on behalf of the WarCabinet, that, after the first instalment of 1,750 men hadbeen provided, the question of a further release should bereconsidered.     In spite of delays&quot;due to various causes,  including theopposition of the Secretary/of. theTransport Workers&apos;  Peder-ation, the release of men seems to be proceeding satisfactorily
     if slowly,  and  I have no reason to believe  that the numbers     in the  first  instalment will not be  forthcomi&amp;g.  Thus, to     take  the six  ports of London, Hull,  Swansea, Leith, Aberdeen,     and Plymouth, I have information that, out  of 1,062 men called     for,  937 in  Glass A have been released, and, in addition, 402     in lower categories.             (c)  The Civil Service,-     Of the  2,000 men to be     released, the Treasury fised the quota of the Board of Trade     at 25 in Glass A or B 1. the release to date from the 1st     May,   From the 1st to the 25th May, 15 were released, and 8     more have been released since,  while several are due to go very     shortly.         (3) As regards the remark in paragraph 9 that other     Government Departments besides the Admiralty,  refused to be     bound by the decision  of the v/ar Cabinet in January last that     all men fit for general service of the ages of 18 to 22 should.     be released, I may state that the Board of ^rade was not one     of these Departments,  all their officers in that category     (some hundreds in number)  having been released except four     in the War Risks Insurance Office,  who,  for special reasons,    were exempted, with the consent of the National Service De-    partment,  for short periods to  give an opportunity of find-     ing substitutes. y.                                                    A. H.  S.29th June,  1917.
