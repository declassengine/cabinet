The - Admiralty inform&apos; me that since the question  - was  first raised, a. great deal has been done to remedy any   weakness of control which originally existed, and in the   opinion of the  Trade Division and the Transport Ttepartment,   there is not nearly the same necessity for immediate action  / as was thought  to exist earlier in the year.         There is  also a question of policy,  as to. whether   the  Mercantile  Marine will  resent statutory provision being   made when there is not much reasori to believe that - there is  : any&quot;reluctance  on.their part to comply with Admiralty ins truc-;&apos;&apos; tions.    - -                                                &apos;.&apos;         The. question is now before the  Board  of Admiralty,  and   they will render a further&apos;report in  due course.                                     : flntldj  M,P.A.H.   2., &quot;Whitehall  Gardens,  S.W.
