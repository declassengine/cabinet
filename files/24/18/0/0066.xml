i                                                                9 Q                            Department of Information                                Intelligence Bureau                                    FS&quot;//005  WEEKLY REPORT ON SPAIN V        July 3 1917       A. postscript to la3t week&apos;s report mentioned that news had  had just arrived from Spain thai the Government had suspended  the Constitutional Guaranteesi    This means that the rights of  freedom of the press,  freedom of political meeting and what we  should call Habeas Corpus cease and the Government oan arrest  suspected persons without judicial warrant and prevent any  writing or speaking which it considers dangerous.   It has not  the significance which similar action would have in England.  Indeed the same course has been taken many times already during  the present reign.   It seems to have been adopted at the  present moment,  not in view of any special danger,  but on  account of the generally excited state of the country and in  order to give the Government the power to deal immediately with  any emergency.       One of its results is the establishment of a censorship,  so that it is difficult to form an opinion either as to how great  the need waa or how far it has been successfully met.    There  was an expectation of a general strike of a political  character  on July 1st but,  so far as it as at present known here, no im-  portant strike has ecourred except at Cartagena.    On the whole  the safest guess at the issue of an obscure situation may probably  be that the Government will weather the storm and nothing very  serious will come of it.      The Army remains quiet so far as is known.   Indeed it may               Or.  well rest on tys laurels;   for its victory waa complete and came,            forwarded  as a report/by Sir Arthur Hardinge shews,  after a long struggle
  and a  suootssion ef J/inisterial attempts at the  suppression of the  Cemmittoes;   The final defiance of authority was  complete,  General Marina was told that if he did not release the officers  under  arrest, their oomrades would do it themselves, and m  officers would bt allowed to accept appointments to fill their  places.   This last resolution is practically that familiar  in the  r-abour World;  &quot;Ho blacklegs.&quot;  As such it emphasizes the  Syndicalist character of the whole action of the officers, which  is reported to have led to the formation of similar Committees by  other Civil Servants and among University Professors and to attempts at something of thi  kind among the  Haval Officers.    All this con- firms  the  view expressed last week  that  the movement was primarily professional and not  political.   So  dots  the report that the attempts of the  Republican politicians to obtain  an alliance with the officers mtt with a rebuff.    The Army,  in fact,  so long at  any  rate as it  can get all it wants out  of the present regime sees no  immediate reason for disturbing it and prefers to draw as loyal a  veil as may be over what it might  have done if  it had been resisted.    Probably as part of this policy, the Infantry  Committee has issued a statement (1) that there  is  no joint Committee of Infantry, Artillery and  Cavalry officers,  (2)  that the demands of the Infantry are not yet defined; but (3) that whan defined they will be found to be summed up  in the motto &quot;Morality and Justice&quot;!-;:  One important proof of their modera- tion they must be admitted to give.    They are not asking for any Increase of pay for themselves.   But  as   pain already spends more Gn its Army per head of the population than any country in Europe except JTranoe and England,  and as before  the War the Spanish Army is said ta  have contained more Colonels than the German,  this midera- tion may be more apparent  than real.   And  the startling statementwith which  the declaration of  the Committee concludes  is  a warning that their  movement however professional  in origin could not be so
Suooa^sful as ii^was- TTtthtniQ enoouraging &quot;them to other ambitions-They affirm that their aims are not selfish but &quot;are based on the jLdesire to extend our aegis over all branches of .the publio serviaei&quot;a somewhat ominous desire to be publicly announced by the army of anominally liberal and constitutional country.&apos;    Senor Dato&apos;s accession to office cannot be said &quot;bp- have beenenthusiastically received.   It seems to have caused disappointmentin all directions;  not that there is anything to be said against                                    -t                                    *him, but that the recent crisis had somehow aroused vague hapes ofthe beginning of a new order worked by new men and characterisedby an abolition of the old system of &quot;arranging&quot; all business andjobbing all promotion.   This system is more and more openly andgenerally denounced as &quot;Caoiquism&quot; (a &quot;oacique&quot; is a local partyboss who distributes patronage) but it is easier to denounce it than                                       ....... -tto find the new men and new methods to replace it.   These attacksare partly made by honest critics.   But they are undoubtedly alsostimulated by German hatred of Dato and Romances, both of whomhave shown pro-Ally leanings, as has the new Foreign Minister, theMarquis of Lema, who is consequently much abused by the German^-phil press.   The hope if the pro-Germans is reported to be thefermation of a so-called &quot;Rational&quot; Cabinet consisting of Mauristsand the &quot;Democratic&quot; liberals who are hostile to Romanones.   ThoPremier put forward for this fanciful Ministry is Villanueva theLiberal President of the Chamber of Deputies, who has just played thprincipal part in the intrigue which has oaused Ceunt Romanones toresign the Leadership of the Liberal Party.   The lead of the partyhas been placed.in the&quot;hands of a Direetoratt of three, Alhuoemas(Garcia Prieto) Alba and Tillanxtevs nimself.   But the notion ofMaura combining in a Cabinet with the Libaral^. vrovl&amp;JMvm to be only
 less grotesque than the scheme, which we know to have been  dis- cussed by people usually thought to be serious politicians, of a Republic with the reactionary Maura as President/   Meanwhile Pate doss not intend to dissolve the Cortes where, with the supoort of the Romanones gr^up,  his position will probably be quite secure. The.age of the Minister for War, the Marquis de Estella, will pro- vide a good excuse for his retirement if his unpopularity with the A Army proves too great or a change of military policy is found to be necessary.    On the whole there seems nc obvious reason, in the abscence of actual revolution,  why the Dato Cabinet should not successfully live out the ordinary life,  never enormously robust and seldom very lengthy,  ef a Spanish Ministry.    Romanones will support it and bide his  time.   &apos; Certainly the last has not beenheard if him.&apos;   Indeed his prompt resignation was probably a shrewd move to  divide his rivals,  whose triple Directorate is not likely to be overharmonious.  .  The most important oxtfsnal event of the week has been the release of the  German submarine which put into Cadiz on the 11th of June,  to which  the Spanish Government has given all or more than all the benefit of  those very International laws which the submarine campaign so flagrantly violates.    This concession to German pressure has been immediately balanced, by a decree forbiddingbelligerent submarines to enter Spanish waters on pain of intern-ment.    If we are able to see  that  the decree is  really enforoed,whether b&quot; the  Spaniards  if they have the -sower  or by ourselves if they have not,  the sailing  of U.C.  52  from Cadiz will not prove to have been an unmixed  evil.     Another matter of British  interest has been  settled by a decree permitting the export  of 40,  000 tons of  early potatoes.
The last Government would only grant 5000 tons.   The presentarrangement is at once fairly satisfactory to England and highlyprofitable to the Spanish Government,  which ought to make 80,  000 out of the export duty to be  charged on tha potatoes.Other commercial questions seem likely to be favourably adjustedmore  or less in the spirit,  though not to the latter of the Ctr-tona  agreement which has  not been confirmed.
