SECKSTWAR  CABIffiff.38G.T. 1217LABOUR DELEGATION TO THE U.S.A.Delegates&apos; Report.1.IHFORfcAL COHJ7BK5UCISS WITH FEDERATION OF LABOUR.     On arriving at Washington on the 5th May we at once gotinto touch with the American Federation of Labour and its Presi-dent, Mr. Gompers,  at whose invitation the Delegation had beensent.   We began our work with a number of informal conferenceswith the Executive Committee of the Federation.   The subjectsdiscussed at these meetings ranged over the whole field of theMunitions of War Acts and took in also a number -of questionsconnected, with the Military Service Acts,  and the subject ofpensions,. separation-allowances and the like.   It was clear existed  in this  country between Labour  and  Government,  and secondly with the  extent to. which Labour had  been  led  to sacrifice its. cherished standards..   The question  of the  preser- vation of &quot;standards&quot;  (i.e. Union customs and practices)  was the one  which at the moment principally occupied the minds  of persons  in. the. United  States interested in  labour  and  its organisation for the war..   In partidular we  found that, the question of an eight hours1 day for Government Workers was  a burning  question.    A federal law prescribes an eight hours&apos; day for  all workmen engaged upon Government work,  but  by  a recent clause in the Naval Appropriation Bill, the President has power to suspend this Regulation  to meet  a national emer-  . gency.   The question of an eight hours1 Bill is.  obviously bound  up with the whole subject of the  economical  organisation of  labour, e.g. given  sufficient labour it  is obviously possible to  substitute for, say, two ten hours1  shifts, three, shifts of eight  hours.  Such re-arrangement at  once opens such wide sub-  . jects  as that of the introduction of  women  upon men&apos;s work.  ,In general  wo found that  the attitude of the Committee upon  allQuestions of &quot;standards&quot; was hesitant.  They  expressed themselveB willing-to abandon this or that standard &quot;when a necessity,  was shown&quot;,  but several times when such a question as  that of the. introduction of women  upon.skilled work,and  the immediate  train- ing of women for such  work, was raised,it was contended that there was no shortage  of labour at the present..  Mr. Gompers himself left upon us  the impression that he was in his own view much in  advance of  his Committee and was ready to make readjustments and  aooept sacrifioes for whiohhe knew that his Committee as a whole  were not prepared.  Ke was  anxious to keep well  ahead of them  but olearty did not  intend to press his own views to a  point at which he would not only lose hold of  the Federation,but as a consequence become of less use to his  own Government.. 2.-  MEETIHG WITH HATTOITAL ADVISOR/ COMMITTEE.     After these informal conferences with for. Gompers&apos; Exeoutive Committee we met in Washington the National Advisory Committee upon Labour of which Mr. Gompers is the Head. This Committee, which  oonsista of  about 200 members.,,  representing  employers and employed, is at  the moment the principal connecting link  between labour,  capital  and Government in the United  States.  The meeting (perhaps the most  significant meeting which we attended during our stay in  the U.S.A.) was addressed by  all the  Members of the Delegation,, as well as by various members of  the Committee  itself. A clear  and detailed exposition was given of  the Labour position in  England at the beginning of the /
 the war,  and of the changes which had taken place as a consequence of the war.    At this  meeting,  as at all our other meetings, particular stress was  l-:id on the co-operation which had been brought about in England between labour and Government, and we tool: it upon ourselves to urge  upon employers and employed and upon the  Government the method  of conference as the proper method in which to  approach the problems now raised in the United States, This method  of conference was clearly a new notion to the Oom- mittee; though a familiar one in this country,  and what was siid upon the  subject met a very remarkable and ready response net only from the side of  the Unions but from that  of the multi- millionaires, e.g. Mr.Rockfeller,  who spoke enthusiastically upon the  subject,   The meeting- was prolonged until 11 p.m. and numberless questions, wore put and answered.   These questions and answers constituted one of the  most important features of the meeting.   Me -ould wish  to call attention to the fact that the meeting was  attended by a representative cf Canadian Labour, Mr.Waters, acting as the  Delegate cf the Canadian Government, who spoke about labour conditions in Canada in  a very unfavour- able sense,  severely criticising the manner in  which both the Home and  the Colonial-  Government had treated munitions -writers, Mr,  Waters at the same time developed a strong  stop-the-war attitude.    *?e conversed  afterwards both with Mr.Waters and with three  other  representatives of  Canadian Labour,, and elicited from them that their principal grievance was that their Government had taken  no  steps to enforce a f-iir wage for munitions work.    We asked  Mr.  Takers to let us have in writing at some  time a business- like. statement of the  principal grievances which he had aired in general terms at the meeting.       Upon the day following this  conference we -were invited to attend  and speak before  the  Tar  Cabinet -t  and tit  our  meeting with the T&apos;&apos;ar  Cabinet Mr,Balfour was  also  present,  .   Mr.Thonas explained  to  the  Cabinet  the main  lines  of the  Munitions  of Tar  Acts,  and dwelt again upon  the  success in England of  the method of  conference.,  answering also  a  number of questions  upon points  of  detail.    The %  Cabinet were  anxious  tc  hear  the other members of  the Delegation, and  in  order not to  shorten the proceedings  undulyr they  invited u3 to  attend on  the  first  day of the week  following and  continue our discussion,    Upon this second  occasion Sr.Dowerman  dwelt on a number of points of detail  in  connection with the Munitions Acts, war pensions, etc , and Itfr.Garrofl. spoke upon the experience  of the  Government in connection with the  regulation  of hours  of work. 4* PITTSBURGH  COOTS &quot;CT.CJ3 AKP VISIT TO FACTORIES,      From Washington we went to Pittsburgh where we were occupied in visiting two large  factories,  the Heinz Torks, an&amp;&quot; the Westinghcuse,  and in addressing a small meeting of Trade- Union representatives.   &apos;To pressed upon the meeting the same considerations as we had urged  in Washington.   In the Heins factory.we were mainly concerned with the work done in connection with welfare and were greatly impressed with the provisionmade for canteen, ambulance, recreation rooms, including a large theatre and  dancing hall and a club.
               5.  CHICAGO: PUBLIC MEgTIITG,      From Pittsburgh we went  to  Chicago  whore we visited therethe well-known Armour works, and  where Mr.Bowerman and Mr.Thomasaddressed  a  large audience  in  the Morrison Hovel*    We  hadintended to  make a  longer stay here, bat  discovered that M^Gompers1Federation had made other arrangements for us  and wished usimmediately  to repair to Cleveland.               6. CimBIAND; PUBLIC MEETING.      At Cleveland wo took part in a conference representingemployers and labour organised by ex-Ambassaior Herrick.  Thismeeting was attended by about 1,000 persons&apos; and was perhaps themost important at which we were present save that in&quot;Washingtonalready referred to.   The Conference was addressed by Mr.Thomasand Mr.Bowerman who covered much the same ground as was coveredin Washington, and an animated general discussion follo7/edtheir speeches.   We attached special importance to this meetingowing to the fact that,  while more than three fifths ox thepopulation of Cleveland are of alien origin, wo had no wlieremore enthusiastic a reception.   &quot;/e felt that nowhere had we donebetter work.   It is worth observing that both hero and inothor places two questions constantly occ^irred in discussion,namoly why England professing to  fight the battle oi&quot; democracy,maintained a monarchy,  and how she reconciled her championshipof small nations with&apos;the denial of Home Rule &quot;to Ireland.We think it right to make mention of this for tho learon thatthe points referred to  are in our opinion undoubtedly (at anyrate among uninstructed Americana) a source of a certain wantof sympathy between this country and organised labour in theUnited States.The welfare work in the Weatinghouse is also remarkable; andin general it may be said that the larger employers in Americahare, as a business proposition, done for the welfare of theiremployeest things which, in this country would be thought almostincredible.   In the main this is done as a piece ox businessbut they seem also to take a kind of pride in vising with oneanother in the magnificence of what they can do in this line.The Westinghouse was at the time not engaged upon any munitionscontracts.   There may,  however, be mentioned here a renarkablestatement made to us by the Manager which throv/s some lightupon the attitude towards tho war of The large body of alienlabour employed in America.   A number of German-born workmenemployed at the Wostinghouse had at an early period of the warrefused to work upon munitions for the Allies.   Their attitudewas accepted by their employers as not unreasonable and theywere put on other work.    On the declaration of war by Americathey notified their employers that as American citizens theywere now willing to be employed upon munitions work.
             7.ALBANY; VISITS TO FACTORIES               MEETING AT SCKENEOTABY.    Prom Cleveland we went to Albany where we visted theworks of the New York Central Railway and these of theGeneral Electric Company at Schehectady.  At.theselatter works Mr. Thomas addressed an open-air meetingof about 20,000 workmen, very many of them of foreignextraction.  In the General Electric Company1s works wewere impressed &quot;by the vastness of the plant, and, &quot;bothhere and in the New York Railway Company&apos;s works,by theelaborate precautions taken to protect workmen frominjury.&quot;Safety first&quot; devices of a simple but effectivekind were everywhere in use, and in the Railway ^dmpany&apos;sworks there was a travelling train with a cinematographapparatus illustrating the dangers arising from thecareless performance of every day operations.            8. BOSTON     From Albany we went to Boston visiting in theneighbourhood of Boston the Beverley Works of theUnited Shoe Manufacturing Company.            9. NEW YORK: CIVIC FEDERATION:                   Wcir Chester.     From Boston we went to New York in order to attenda luncheon given in- our honour b5r the American CivicFederation.  We were closely in touch throughout our workwith the principal persons connected with this Federation,which is an organisation  including both employers andemployed,very largely concerning itself with improvingconditions among workers in the United States, It may V-pointed out here that at thjj3 lunche-on, as at many othersimilar functions which we attended, there wore speechesin which the members of the Delation endeavoured toreiterate the lessons-which they had first tried toformulate in Washington. A feature of American life wouldappear to be a business luncheon accompanied eometim.es byset, though informal, conversation across the table upon aprescribed subject, and accompanied by speeches afterwardsAt functions of this kind we very often had valuable dis-cU3sion8 and got hold of persons who would not otherwieohave been easily available.      Before we left New York we paid a visit of greatinterest to the West Chester Penitentiary, called by theAmerican Press &quot;the Gaol de Luxe&quot;. This is a prison foroffenders undergoing a sentence of not more than a year.The building is itself one of some architectural preten-sions, and throughout it there is abundance of air and &quot;*light. The cells are extraordinary! j&amp;o^fortable and clean,and the food (to judge by the fact that the prisonersleft meat upon their plates) abundant.   All the wardersare University graduates and the prisoners are allowedbooks,papers,tobacco, and visits from their friends. Theyare divided into two batches of about 20&quot;men,each of whifhelects one cf their number to act as &apos;mofnitor&apos; and beresponsible for the discipline cf his seation, and to impas*punishments for offences against  discipline. The prisoners &quot;work nine hours a day in the open air. The whole system isah experiment and has not yet. been in operation for suffi-cient time to enable it to he judged fairly, but we weredeeply impressed with what wjs saw and we found the Governorhimself enthusiastic as tip the results already achieved anfl.those anticipated.
10, SUMMARY OP RESULTS AUD IMPRESSIONS.     We were very strongly urged &quot;by Mr, Gompers, Toy representa-tives of employers,  and by the American Government to extendour stay in the United States by another month and to visit thefurther West and the Pacific Coast.   This invitation we were netable to accept^ but we took it as a general indication that thework which ws had been doing was regarded as of real value l*yall parties.  In summarising this work it may bo said that whathad been done by the co-operation of labour capital ani Govern-ment in England during the war was how and strange to themajority of our audiences.  We did our best at all points tourge upon employers and workmen alike the need of oeming tcconference and of doing so early, arid of coming to conferencein a spirit ready to bargain fairly and to make sacrifices.  Weurged this on the Government, on employers, cn the Federation ofLabour and on representatives of individual Unions, and if any-thing can be judged from what was said to us by the differentparties in this connection, it seems likely that a real effortat adjustment on the lines which we suggested may come to pass.Upon particular political questions we wore earaful not tc giveopinions on our own.   For example, on the question of an eighthours&apos; day we abstained from offering advice or suggestion toany party.  We were, however, frank in explaining what the ccn-ditions as to the duration of hours in England were,  and whatour experience of the war had been in respect of overtime.  Weof course called attention to the report of the Health efMunitiorsWorkers1 Committee,  but in doing so we wer*  carefulto point out that in view for example of the paramount need ofships at the moment for the Allies, it would be impossible with-out knowing the conditions in the United Statos as to the amountof labour available, to advise that a system of overtime wouldnot *e required.     It should be added that the orinoipal difference betweenthe lafceur situation in this country and that in the  UnitedStates consists in the faot that there is in the latter anenormous amount of labour not organised in Unions, Forexample, the labour in steol manufacture is altogether un-organised.  It may be further observed that many of the TradeUnion practices and custcma known in England prior to the wardo not obtain i* America,  It would seem that the principaltrouble with American labour is likely to centre in the  twodifficulties already referred to, namely hours of labour, andwhat we call dilution.                11.  THE POLITICAL SITUATION.     Of the political situation in America generally we hadno opportunity tu form an accurate opinion.   Our  general im-pression was that the Government  was  largely  a one-man Govern-ment, that it was in faot President Wilson, and that with theexception perhaps of the Labour Minister,  the V/ar Minister,  andthe Minister of the  Interior,  the Government  did  not containstrong men.  From conversation with influential persons we in-ferred that this somewhat autocratic  Government was  not in thehabit on business questions  of consulting  the more pro-minent andinfluential business men.   There was a  disposition  to treat the
powerfuj  employer somewhat as though he were from the nature ofthings a brigand.   On the other hand we inferred from the  samesources that a Coalition Government (which might seem the mostnatural fashion for the American nation to approaoh its problemsin) was not a matter of praOtical politics.        A word may be added as to what appeared to us to be  theattitude of the everyday American towards the War.  At any  ratein the first part of our stay recruiting was bad. and the WarLoan was not doing well.   We felt that Americans in generaldid not as yet realise in any proper een&amp;e that they were at warand that they would not do so until their pride had been hurt bya defeat or the prospect of one,-   We thought that the develop-ments in Russia had already done something-to bring home to  themthe magnitude of the sacrifices which might ultimately berequired of them.   Of pro-German sympathies we encountered butlittle, theugh we came across in discussion a certain number ofGerman-born Americans,  We gathered that the German factionwas rendered harmless by the absence of any leaders.  On theother hand we did find in many classes the feeling that America,tMuga quits reedy to fight a war of her own, did not care&quot;to fight England&apos;e battle&quot;.   There appeared, however, to bein all classes a very deep sympathy for the French, and of coursefor Belgium.   Amorg the upper classes we found a good manypeople who expressed a deep dissatisfaction that Fras.ce andEngland should be fighting alone in a war m *-vioh the honourand interests of America were equally at.stake.(Sd)     C.W.BOWEBMAlsr        J.H.TH0MIS        H.W.GARR0D.26th June  1917.r
