.T. 1243.                        &quot;  WAR -CABTICBT.. &quot;     GONCESSIOffS-TO IRISH. SSgVSRS  AS TO IUCREA3E IN  OUTPUT.   ;  .;      (Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.);      In view of very urgent representations which have  reachedme from Ireland I. think it necessary to present.this  memorandum-;;.with regard.to the decision recencly taken for an.increase  of  theoutput of breweries during the summer, and changes&apos;in the formof that decision,  which,;1 am told, are being discussed  betweenthe Pood Controller and the English-Brewers.      It is possible,  as I am informed; that the additional issueof malt for the summer brewing will be made subj ect to somecondition as to the gravity of not-only the additional beer tobe brewed for the summer,  but some, fixed proportion, of the  wholeoutput of thebrewers who receive the additional supplies.      I am told that in Ireland the adoption of the proposedstandard for light beer, which is represented; by a figure, of1036,  would render it impossible to make.any addition to the pres-ent output.  In particular no addition would probably be possibleduring the present season in the case of Messrs, Guinness&apos;Brewery i  The difficulty,  as it is explained to me, arises  fromthe fact that the specific gravity of normal Irish brewings hasalways been a good deal higher than the specific gravity prevailingin England and Scotland.-  The &apos;.average&apos; in England in 1915 was re-&apos;represehted by the figure .1051, wherea,-s in Ireland the figure  was1066 -  The proposed reduction in the standard in -England wouIdreduce the specific gravity by..15 pointsj  that is to  say, to :-1036.  A reduction to 1036 in the Irish average would mean  areduction of twice the proportionate amount of the English  reduc-tion, that; is a reduction of 30 points against a reduction  of  15points&apos;.      Colonel Addison, a member of -Messrs i Guinness&apos;&apos; :,Board,  sawme this morning and -told, me&apos; that;the. appii catiOn to. Ire] apd: of.a compulsory standard of 1036 for the:somber brewing  would  meanin. the case of his own firm - and he believed in the  case sfIrish Brewers,&apos;generally - that they would be limited  to  thesupplies previously fixed. . .&apos;     - In view of the very serious situation among the. working.o1asses. in Dublin:which has been caused by..who 1esaledismisaalsv-f labour-from the breweries by reason of-the operation  of --war.- -restrictions;.upon brewing,it :1-a .in the hi ghest de gree desirablethat any increase in&quot;:output which is allowed in&apos; the English  -Breweries&apos;, shall; be accompanied: by a like increase in  the Irish.&apos;.Breweries.       &apos;                                           &apos;      Colonel Addis on  suggested to me as a means of  &quot;meeting theIrish difficulty the adoption of a rule which wouId require brewersto reduce the standard  of gravities they used in the  year 1913/1914 by a proportionate diminution of gravity dependent  upon thestandard then used.  He suggests that the object in view would be.attained if the rule were; that beer brewed above 1045 should ber?d^i-(iJ?&apos;0 &quot;Percent and beer brewed at^Tn^mv&quot;JL035&quot;&quot;ahould  bereauced to/l036 and that there Should be some^rovision  under  apermit of the Poiod Controller: for the brewing of small quantitiesof special brands of stout and: beer which are necessary  for theuse of invalids.
      The diminution to the extent of some thousands in  the number of hands employed in the Dublin breweries and distilleries which has- followed upon the restriction in the output.of intoxi-cants has become a serious factor in the problem\of. maintenance of order in Dublin,  and it is because of this aspect of  the matter that I am exceedingly anxious no fresh step should be taken which appears to worsen the conditions as to employment in Dublin or to withhold from Dublin any relaxation of the existing restrictions which ie found possible in Great Britain.                               ,         (initialled).
