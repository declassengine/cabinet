^SECRET.^JTEBKIL^^^ Intelligence Bureau,                    Department of Information,                               DRW/010.VWEEKLY REPORT ON RUMANIA. X.June 27, 1917.russiar  Attitude  towards Rumania and, Rumania*s Treaty with the Allies.     A very important article,  written by the Balkan authorityProfessor Vodovozov,  appeared in the Petrograd Radical paper Dyen(May 14/27).   A short account of this was given in the ManchesterGuardian (June 23).   The writer gives a very full and, in the main,accurate account of  the conditions laid down in the treaty concludedin August 1916.  He  is intensely hostile to Rumania and does notcontent himself with calling attention to instances in which theRumanian  demands conceded by the Allies cannot be justified onpurely ethnographical grounds,  but puts the case in such a way thatthe average reader would conclude that Rumania has no right to anyAustro-Hungarian territories from the point of view of racialdistribution.  Further, he goes on to attack the Government and thesocial structure of  Rumania, and especially the Rumanian Governments .treatment of the Bulgar population of Dobrogea and of the Jews.He concludes: &quot;If Serbia and Belgium appeared the unfortunate,guiltless and innocent victims  of foreign aggressive tendencies,Rumania appeared also the unfortunate, but the guilty victim ofher own personal imperialism and her own light-minded greed&quot;.     The article gained importance from the fact that a day or solater a leading article appeared in the Dyelo,Naroda, a new paperstarted at the time of the  Revolution as  Mr Kerenski&apos;s  organ,calling particular attention to  Professor Vcdovozov&apos;s article  andstrongly endorsing it.  it  is impossible  to avoid the conclusion thatMr Kerenski and the circles round him are therefore totally  opposedto Rumanian claims and havo no inclination 4.0 further good relations
between their own country and Rumania.  The only way in which suchill-feeling could be removed would be by the continual publication ofimpartial and temperate statements on the part of Rumania&apos;s WesternAllies of the Rumanian aspect of the Austro-Hungarian question.Further, Rumania can hardly hope to improve her relations with thenew Russian Government unless she takes energetic steps to show thatthe promised reforms in Rumania are to be at once passed into law,Rumania and Austria-Hungary.     There is no further news as to the condition of the Rumanianpopulation of Hungary.  The attitude of the Rumanians under Austrianrule (in Bukovina) is illustrated by the claims put forward on theoccasion of a meeting of the Austrian Reichsrat by Hr Onciul, oneof the five Ruman deputies of Bukovina.  This has been treated inWeekly Report on Austria-Hungary, No.5, June 16, published by thisBureau, where it is pointed out that Mr Onciulrs demand for the unionof the whole Rumanian race by the election of the Emperor of Austriaas their King is interesting as showing that the Rumanians of the DualMonarchy look on union as the only solution of the Rumanian problem.The added detail &quot;under the Habsburg Crown&quot; is of little importance,for this is the only way in which the solution could be proposed, andit is obviously in itself impossible for it would completely throwout of balance the already unwieldy structure of the Dual Monarchy.     Curiously enough a s^ojewhat similar demand from another quarterappears in the Pester Lloyd (June 7).  This Is an article written byDr Karl Folff, one of the two most prominent Saxon leaders inTransilvania, a member of the House of Magnates in Budapest, and theChairman of the leading Saxon, Bank in Hermannstadt.  The writercontends the faithlessness of Rumania&apos;s policy would fully justifythe victorious Central Powers in &quot;erasing conquered Rumania as aState from  the map of Europe&quot;.  He goes on to argue that Rumania
has  failed to constitute herself Europess faithful guardian of thedefence of the Danube against Eastern Powers, and that Rumaniansociety is entirely corrupt and worthless.  The only satisfactorysolution,  says Dr lolff,  is the establishment of a control overRumania by Austria-Hungary;  above all, the frontier-line must be- redrawn so as to give the strategic advantages to Austria-Hungary.He proposes that the Hungarian frontier should be extended to aline running from Turn-Severin through Targul-Jiu, Calimanesti,Campolung and Campina.  It may be noticed incidentally that suchan alteration of the frontier would hand over to &quot;Central Europe&quot;the chief petrol area of Rumania.     The most interesting  aspect of these two statements is thatfrom different points of view they both recognise that the Rumanianquestion can only be solved in a radical form:  either Rumania isabsorbed nominally, or if not nominally at least in fact, in theCentral European Alliance, or else Rumanian unity will be achievedunder the Rumanian Crown.                                         A.1.A.L.                                            27.6.17.
