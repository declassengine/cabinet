[This Document is the  Property of His Britannic- Majesty s Government,]   3                 Printed for the War Cabinet.  July 1917.SECRET.NAVAL  WEEKLY APPRECIATION, 6.   With the exception of the submarine attack on trade, there have been no operations otimportance during the week.                         SUBMARINE ATTACK ON TRADE.    THE  following table  compares the tonnage and number of  British, Allied, andneutral ships entering or clearing to and from the United Kingdom, with the number andtonnage of ships sunk  by submarine or mine whilst on passage to or from the UnitedKingdom during the same period.  All coastal, Channel, and Dutch  trade is eliminated.Commissioned vessels  and  troopships are  not included.  Under the heading &quot; OtherVoyages &quot;  are included those ships sunk on other oversea Yoy&amp;ges  than to or from theUnited Kingdom.

     The losses, which  show a  decrease  on each, of the previous  three weeks, weredistributed  as  follows:  Channel, North  and West of Scotland, and Mediterranean,.4 each ; South  and West of Ireland and the Bay of Biscay. 3 each ; North Sea, 2.     The enemy submarines seem to be going further and further to sea for their prey,attacks having  been reported in longitude 26Q and 290 west, about 800 miles  from thecoast of Spain.   A submarine is  also reported to have bombarded Ponta Delgada, inthe island of San Miguel, in the Azores, on the 4th  July, and this  probably accountsfor these attacks  so far to the westward.  The fire was returned by  a United Statescollier in the harbour.   A total of thirty-three submarines are believed to have beenoperating in the different areas, and in the  various  encounters  that have taken placebetween them and II.M. ships successful results were probably obtained in one case.    . Out of  11  ships sunk in the vicinity of the United Kingdom, 6 were outward and5  inward bound.  This  is the  first  time  on record that the outward sinkings haveexceeded  the inward.   The reduction in  the  latter is probably accounted for by theholding back of ships for convoy.     The  British  consul  at.  Cadiz  reports that  U.C.  52, which  put into Cadiz forrepairs on the 11th June, ]eft the port on the 2nd July, escorted  by two torpedo-boats.During the last.two months German submarines  are reported on reliable authority tohave sunk eleven neutral and three  belligerent merchant ships  in  Spanish territorialwaters.  It  appears, therefore, that any advantages which the Allies might obtain fromthe \ise of Spanish territorial  waters  are more imaginary than real.     There has been minelaying activity in the  Lowestoft area, in  the vicinity of theOrkneys and Shetlands, and on the south-west coast  of Ireland.  Seventy-seven mineswere destroyed during the week.     In addition to the submarine attack, the two armed  raiders which were known tobe at sea in February and March are still unaccounted for.   An S.O.S. call was heardnear the coast of Chile on the 2nd July, so  it is possible that one of  them is nowoperating on the Pacific coast.  The P. and  0. liner  &quot; Mongolia &quot; was sunk by a minenear Bombay on the 27th June.   This  was presumably one of those laid by the raider&quot; Wolf&quot; in February of this year.  &apos;     There were eighty-five British  ships of over 1,600 tons  sunk by submarines ormines between  the 28th May and  23rd June, which gives  an average loss of twenty-onelarge ships per week.     The cumulative effect of  the  loss of twenty ships a week  on the importing powerof the country may be demonstrated as follows : *     The average size of  ships over 1,600 tons gross is 4,525 tons, and a loss of twentyof these ships each week corresponds to 4,700,000 tons in a year, or nearly one-third ofour  entire mercantile shipping of similar size, including vessels trading abroad andnot  therefore  exposed  to  the same  danger.   Against this loss  we, can  set  newconstruction, less losses from  ordinary marine risks :                            -             &apos;                      &apos;                              Tons...         The new building for a year may be put at  ...       ...  1,000,000         Ordinary marine risks at ...       ...       ...       ...    2-r)0,000         This leaves a surplus tonnage of,   ...       ...        ...   750,000         And the net loss in one year is     ....      ...       ...  4,000,000     Four million tons of shipping corresponds to an importing power of 15,000,000 tonsof cargo, but as each ship may be assumed  to do six months&apos; work before being sunk,the actual yearly loss may be taken as 7,500,000 tons.     In ly 16 the total imports carried  in British  ships amounted to about  43,000,000tons, but  owing to the shortage  of  tonnage arising from  the submarine  campaign,and  our  greater military commitments, it is calculated  that there is only sufficientshipping to import 30,000 000 tons in.1917.     A loss of twenty ships a  week therefore corresponds to a dead loss of one quarterof the greatly reduced imports, unless there is a reserve of tonnage to make up the loss.Up  till now there has been  that  reserve, and that  is  the reason why the  submarinecampaign has not yet exercised any vital influence on the course of events.     Britain  was the carrier of the world and the wagoner.. of  the sea before the war,  ,/and  was able to recall her ships from the service  of other countries, and also to effectgreat economies by cutting down unessential imports and exports, and by reducing thenumber of long voyages.  The North Atlantic trade has been  continually fille*d  upfrom these sources, but the time  is not far  distant when every ship that is sunk will      * Shipping statistics are supplied by the  Statistical Department of the Ministry of Shipping.
-either  mean an irreplaceable  loss,  or  necessitate  the withdrawal of ships from theservice of our own or Allied armies.                           .   .     Ship construction in the United States may help the Allies, but a large part of itwill he mortgaged to the service of their own army and in replacing British and neutralships withdrawn from the American carrying trade.                                Minor Operations,     Minelaying operations were carried  out last week  in the Heligoland  Bight, hutwere discontinued this week on account of the full moon..  The laying of deep minesis progressing in the vicinity of Portland  and Portsmouth.  .     One of the German merchantmen trading between Germany and Holland has beentorpedoed near  Terschelling outside territorial  waters  by submarine.  &quot;E.  41.&quot;  Thelatter was returning from laying mines near the Frisian Islands, and sighted two largemerchantmen  of  about 5,000 tons flying no colours, escorted by  an  auxiliary and apatrol  boat.  It is probable that the larger enemy merchantmen have  to pass outsideterritorial waters on this part of the route owing to the shoal water to the westward ofTerschelling.     On  the 3rd July the  machines of the Royal  Naval Air  Service from  Dunkirk-carried out a bombing attack on Bruges Docks.                       SUMMARY OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.
