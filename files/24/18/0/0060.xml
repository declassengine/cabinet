*K  - /p)/v 5 STHE FTI.4ITGIAL POSITION II! CaHADA.(Memorandum from the Minister of Munitions).     1,   The financial position in Canada threatens seriouslyto interfere with the gun ammunition programme.     2.   Complete rounds, shells, steel forgings, cartridgecases and components necessary for the current War Officeprogramme,  costing about $ 55,000,000 are required eachmonth from Canada.contracts up to 30th September, and the total commitmentsamount to about 0 165,000,000.to $ 170,000,000.  In additioncertain continuation orders have been given to preserveCanadian manufacturing capacity the commitments under whichare not yet ascertained.    It.was understood that theseliabilities were being cared for by the Treasury.-     3.   In order to complete  the 1917 programme it wasintended to continue Canadian orders till the end of theyear at a rate  of about 0 53,000,000 a month.Treasury sanction was obtained ine course forOn the 2nd July the Imperial Munitions Boardtelegraphed  -&quot;&apos;:/e have over $ 8,000,000 of chequesoutstanding at the present moment to meet whichthere are no funds in the Bank.   In addition wohave a further $ 11,000,000 of overdue accountsfor which cheques have not yet been issued.   Everynerve has been strained to get over-drafts,  andtemporary  credit but we have  come  to  the  end  ofthese resources.&quot;
           The  telegram  adds that  for the next month  (July) after using  025,000,000 provided  by the Canadian Government the  liabilities  to be met  amount  to 043,000,000 which include, besides munitions proper, repayment of o^rer-drafts and  interest on  Imperial Government obligations.           The  telegram  proceeds -               &quot;Tho failure to meet current obligations     &quot;will of  course havo  an absolutely.disastrous effect     &quot;on the work of the Board here and it would probably     &quot;throw tho whole country into a financial panic and     &quot;bring our work to a  standstill.     ii      ...   ...   .**   . * *   . * .   ...         .o*   *.               &quot;The obligations incurred by us in the name     &quot;of.the Imperial Government on your instructions and     &quot;authorised by tho Treasury are not being met and we     &quot;havo only been able to stave off an avowal of these     &quot;by temporary expedients and these are now exhausted.&quot;     4.    It is impossible to reduce the supplies from Canada already ordorod with Treasury sanction up to 30th September without seriously curtailing the existing War Office programme-After September reductions could bo made which would mean a reduced expenditure of perhaps 015,000,000 a month,  provided that further  steel is obtained from U.3.-A.  and extra tonnage  allotted.     5.    Any further reductions  would  necessitato  a  roduced\,ar Office programme.   If supplies were entirely cut  offa serious position would arise  seeing that  wo  aro receiving350,000  18-?dr  shrapnel  a. week  and 70,000 6-inch Howitzershells a week from Canada,  and  it  would only be possibleto/
to increase production elsewhere  by about  125,000 18-Pdrshrapnel.  -     6.

Please deliver foilow-ing telegram from, us (?) jointly, to Dr.- Add.ison personallyr-Since our arrival in Hew York I have discussed,  the financialposition of Canadian munitions orders fully with lever, Plavolle,Gordon and Perry.   The position is so serious  that we think itnecessary to ask you to give your personal attention to it asit is likely to affect the present and future.. Canada an outputto a very gravo extent.   The Board&apos;s expenditure amounted toabout $50,000,000 in June and the Imperial Treasury onlyprovided $10,000,000 of this  total.    Of the balance, $25,000,000was provided by the Canadian Government sad the remainder wasscraped together by the Board by means of temporary borrowingfrom the Banks./  The Board&apos;s commitments for July amount to$69,000,000,  of which munitions  requirements are $52,000,000,Shipping $2,000,000 and $10,000,000  is needed for re-payingtemporary.Bank  advances,, while $5,000,000 is required to moetthe interest on outstanding Canadian Government and Bank loansto the Treasury which the Treasury have instructed then tocollect from the Imperial Munitions  Board.    Out of this totalof $69,000,000  the  Canadian Government have  stated that only$25,000,000  csa he  provided by them  and $44,000,000 aretherefore left  unprovided for.         lever, for reasons  which he has fully explained tothe Treasury cannot to-day promise that any  part of this sumcan be found by him and he  could not under the  most favourablec i r cums t an c e s/
                               5V circumstances provide more  than.* 025, .000., 000.    Therefore,-, as matters stand, the Board Is.  commitments  during: July will, not he met unless further steps are. taken.   The-Ministry has-instructed the Board to proceed with, the  existing  programme  and has foreshadowed considerable additions to  that.programme but while the Board has not been instructed by  you to- roduce their, programme, the Treasury have informed the Canadian Government that.orders in Canada^can finance the Boards orders.  The Boarti:,.does not know whether this attitude is endorsed  by  the. Ministry,    During the next two or three months the commitments could not.be reduced even If such a policy were immediately -adopted.-   You will understand that if the  Boardrs commitments are not met  in July a financial crisis will occur in Canada with the immediate consequence  that, the operations of the Board will  be brought- to  a standstill and  the supply of munitions from Canada cut&apos; off. As the Chairman  has pointed  out in Cable B.C.416,   the Board cannot take  the  responsibility of  informing Canadian manufacturers that the British Government  cannot meet its liabilities.   The Boards commitments are  for  orders which the Treasury has. authorised and  only the  Treasury can be responsible for finding the money  to  meet those  orders.  If  this money cannot be provided hy the Treasury  the only method of  obtaining it is to try and  obtain from the Canadian Government additional financial  assistance.  Whilewilling to assist in any way,  the Board has no authority to discusswith the Canadian Government official  financial matters.  I venture therefore  to  ask if you  could immediately discuss  this matter with the Chancellor  and then  personally  instruct, the Board as to the course/ -                                          :/
     FROM MINISTER Off MUNITIONS TO IMPERIAL MUNITIONS BOARD,                                         30th June, 1917..M.C.214.  To Brand from Chadwyck Healey.   Your B.C.440. ,Following from Dr. Addison:-  Your cable has beon shown tothe Chancellor and he k&amp;s cabled Lever as follows.  Message begins(Paraphrase) Cable B.C.440 from Brand to Ohadwyck Healey,which you have seen, has been shown to no by Ministry ofMunitions.   Have not yet received answer to oy telegram No. 934.Brand and the Imperial Munitions Board are being.authorisedby the Ministry of Munitions.to take steps, after consultationwith you, to impress on the Canadian officials the seriovsconsequences which failure of funds may ore at e.   Should you,under the present circumstances,  feel unable to  go to Ottawayourself, the Imperial Munitions Board has been authorised toact as above, subject to your ins true t-lono by telegram.   lAessageEnds.course of action they are to adopt.  We-think that it would hedesirable if lever and the Board could meet the officials ofthe Canadian Government at the earliest opportunity and putbefore them the whole financial position.   Would you instructus on this mattor and alsp arrange for the Chancellor toinstruct Lever and also to inform the Canadian Government.This cable has been seen by Lever.
From imperial Munitions Board to Ministry of Munitions                                    2nd. July, 1917.B,0. 446.   Following for Minister from jplavelle.Replying to 11*0. 212 We can carry out programmeindicated in M2302 as far as it concerns shellsup to 6 inch as it will involve little increase inour current production,   he case is differenthowever in regard to 8 inch and 9.2 inch shells.As regards these sizes we have machining plantshut the Canadian forging plants have been, or are,in course of being, dismantled and in view of theindefinite position we have not been able to placeorders for forgings in the TJ.S.A. *  In thesecircumstances,  therefore, there is little chancethat we can obtain forgings in time to carry outthe full programme even if it were now authorisedbut we could fulfil a part of it.  Unless, however,we can get definite assurance of further ordersvery soon, the  Canadian machining plants are likelyto be dismantled also and the situation will befurther complicated thereby.  For several months wehave kept matters open with manufacturers and youwill, I am sure,  understand that it  is  impossiblefor them to  keep  their labour forces together andtheir plants in running order on mere speculation.-Also/
 Also  you will understand -that we hesitate to do so in view  Of the difficulty We;have had during the last few weeks in meeting our current obligations.  We have over 8 million dollars worth of cheques outstanding at the present moment to meet which there are no funds in the Bank.   In addition we have a further 11. millions of overdue account for which cheques have not yet been issued. ...^Every nerve hag been strained to get over drafts and temporary credit but we have come to the end. of these resources.  The Treasury this month have noi only failed to provide us with funds themselves.  . but when we had arranged through the C.P.R.. and the Bank.of Montreal a special loan of 10 million dollars, they had not completed the necessary documents with the Banks in London to enable us to draw on this money.  The arrangements were made on the 16th.  June with the.Banks and we understand that Lever cabled the Treasury asking them to write to the Banks  but  up till to-day the Banks have received no instructions from London.   Consequently,  we  have been practically without funds for more than a month.   In regard  to theposition next month,  all that we have been  told  is that the Treasury will certainly not  be  able  toprovide the whole balance  of our obligations  afterthe 25 million, dollars provided by the Canadian Government  is used up and  that  they are  not certainthat /
 that any part  of it can he provided by them,  The balance in question is 43 million dollars and this includes re-payment of temporary Bank advances falling due and also payment of interest on standing loans, These advances and loans are direct Treasury obligations but tho lenders have been referred to us for payment by the Treasury which means that this money will have to come from the Canadian Government advances to us. The failure to meet curront obligations will of course have an absolutely disastrous effect on the work of the Board here and it would probably throw the whole country into a financial panic and bring our work to a standstill,   I cannot help thinking that on your side the seriousness of the situation has not been sufficiently appreciated.   It is possible that the Canadian Government  may be able, temporarily at any rate,  to give some further assistance but  thewhole amount  required certainly cannot  be provided by them.  In any case the Board  has no authority or standing to enable it to press the Canadian Government to do more than it is doing and any steps in thisdirection must  be taken by the imperial  Governmentdirect.   Meanwhile,  the obligations incurred by us inthe/.
10.the name of the Imperial Government on your instructionsand authorised by the Treasury are not being met and wehave only been able to stave off an avowal of theseby temporary expedients and these are now exhausted.
