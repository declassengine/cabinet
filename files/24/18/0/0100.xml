G.Ti-1299                         WAR CABINETi                 S A L OH I K A.   .Copy of telegram sent to - H;-R. * the Prince Regentof Serbia to *Vice-Admiral Treubridge.           The last offensive was not effective for thefollowing reasons :-     1,    Because all the forces were dispersed along thewhole front from the Aegean Sea to the. Albanian: Alps-.  Withsuch a disposition of troops, the Allied Armies -were.unableto show their strength at, any special point of the line, norwere they able to force the onemyv3 line.     2,    Because the High Command at Salonika allowedall.the Allied contingents to conduct operations separately,each army in its own sector,  without mutual cc-cperation,while the enemy made no distinction, but employed eitherAustro-German or Bulgarian troops according to the exigencyof the moment.  -----  3.    Because two Divisions which were at the disposalof the High Command at Salonika, and which were serving asreserve troops, wero not employed, even at the most criticalmoment - the High Command at Salonika reserving them foreventual operations in Greece.           During the recent allied operations, the forcesof enemy troops changed owing to the arrival cf I oir.for..-ce-menta from other fronts, while certain allied detachmentsleft Salonika for. Greece and Egypt.  Because &quot;of&apos; this,  theAllied Army as it is at present at Salonika can only main-tain its actual positions and retain German and Tuikishtroops in order that the German High Command cannot sendthem to other fronts.           The actual allied troops have successfullyaccomplished their duty, and if the last offensive did notsucceed, at least it resulted in attracting the lastforces of the Bulgarian army from the Danube:  this will,without doubt, have favourable consequences if the Russianand Roumanian Armies take early advantage of it.           The numerical .force of our troops and thosoof our enemy on the Salonika front is, at the presentmoment, approximately equal.  The Allies, however,,possess more artillery, munitions and other war material..           If it is wished to undertake a new and seriousoffensive having for its object not only the breaking ofthe enemy line but also the cutting of the principalcommunications between Berlin and Constantinople, thoexisting force is not sufficient.&apos; In order:thet such anoffensive should succeed, it is necessary that thefollowing conditions should be fulfilled
      1.     3G, 000. new. combatants  to be  sent to reinforce the  Salonika troops..  The Army  actually:at Salonika would.have been  sufficientif each Division  had the effective force of a Division^: but in reality neither the Serbian nor  French Divisions havo more  than the third of the strength, of a.  full-Division^ --      2.     The artillery to be  reinforced with,-12 siege guns of  240- or 280 nviru  and 36-150 m0m0 howitzers-/      3.     A point on the line  of the front to be choson and-decided upon  where forces and material drawn . from all the Allied  troops  shall  be collected and. at such point&apos; the enemy1&apos;s line -shall -be broken,,On the other - sectors  only&apos;the  forces  strictly  necessary for the . defensive  to-.be left.,- The  Bulgarians would be&apos; unablo to resist such an organised attack more especially/ because the  moralu of  the Bulgarian troops Is becoming more and more bad.
