The draft of a memorandum is attached putting forward the suggestion that Dominion High Commissioners mightbe given precedence after Secretaries of State.  It will beremembered that, at the 7th meeting of the polioy Committeeon the 9th of July, (paper I.E.0.(30) 7th Conclusions 4) it-was agreed that, if the question of precedence arose at theConference, it might be possible to take His MajestyIspleasure regarding a proposal of this nature.          If the Cabinet approve in general the terms of the annexed draft memorandum, I should propose as the next step,to submit it informally to the King and, if His majesty should approve the suggestion made, to circulate theMemorandum to the Conference,          It will be noticed that the draft Memorandummakes no reference to the position of Dominion primeMinisters: this omission is intentional since the
special arrangements made in 1924 whereby Dominion PrimeMinisters, when they are in this country are givenspecially high precedence (normally immediately afterthe Prime Minister of the United Kingdom) was notcommunicated to Dominion Prime Ministers at the time -still less publicly announced.          If any question should be raised on this pointby any of the Dominion representatives, it would, nodoubt be desirable to explain the position but otherwise it seems unnecessary to do so,                         (ltd.)

           M_.iL M OR A 11 DU M.          The  question of precedence of High Commissionersfor the Dominions in London was raised at the ImperialConference of  1923 by the Prime Minister of Canada(Mr, Mackenzie KIng)t  As a result of the discussion at the Conference and subsequent  correspondence with thePrime Ministers of the Dominions;, a proposal was submitted to,  and approved by, tho King that theDominion High  Commissioners should be given precedenceon  ceremonial  occasions, after any members of theUnited Kingdom or Dominion Cabinets who might be present on  any given occasion, but not in any caso given aposition superior to that accorded by the Table ofPrecedence to  Secretaries of  State,     2,   In practice the scheme works as follcws.i-     (l)  If United Kingdom or Dominion cabinet ministers are  present. High Commissioners take precedence after them -  i,et(a)  if there  are present United Kingdom Cabinet Ministers     who rank  only as Privy Counsellors or Dominion     Ministers, whether  Privy  Counsellors or not, High     Commissioners rank  immediately aftor them;(b)  if there  are only United  Kingdom Cabinet Ministers     present who rank as Secretaries of State and higher,    - or if there are only United Kingdom Cabinet Ministers     present who rank higher  than Secretaries of State     (ir 6c, the Lord Chancellor, the Prime Minister, the     Lord President  of the Council and the Lord Privy Seal)     High Commissioners  take  precedence immediately after     that given in the Table  of Precedence to Secretaries     of State,
    (2)   If no United Kingdom or Dominion Cabinet Ministers are present, the position is as described under (l)  (b) ,  i-.o. , the High Commissioners take precedence immediately after  that given in&apos;the Table of Precedence to Secretaries of State.    . 5..  A copy of the existing table of Precedence in the: United Kingdom indicating the position is annexed in the Appendix.K     4.   In the memorandum by His Majesty1s Government in  the Union of South Africa, circulated as Paper E.(30) 11, it  is suggested that the different Governments of His Majesty should each accord, within its own territory, to representatives of  the others at  least the same status as is accorded to the represent- atives of foreign Governments.     5.    As has been explained a t &quot;the present  Conference, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would find difficulty in recommending to Els Hajesty that an arrangement of this kind should be maae0         On the other hand they are prepared to recommend  to His Majesty that Dominion High Commissioners should  on all. occasions  (other than those occasions when Ministers of the Crown from the Dominions are present for which see below) rank immediately after Secretaries of  State,&apos; i.e0 before  all other Cabinet Ministers in the United Kingdom except  those who  already have  higher precedence than Secretaries of State.   The effect would be that the High Commissioners would (withx    This Appendix will be attached to the Menorandom     circulated to the Conference:  it is the same as      Appendix 11. of Paner S(BV(50)21.
 the single  exception  indicated)  always  occupy  the position  indicated,  at  (c)  (ii) in  the Appendix.      6.   If  the  above  arrangement were made,  the question  would arise  as  to  tie position of  the High Commissioner for  a  Dominion in relation to  a Minister of. the Crown visiting this  country from a Dominion. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the  United Kingdom con- template  that the existing  position in this respect should remain unaltered, 1.e. that normally a  Minister of the Crown from a Dominion visiting this  country should be given courtesy precedence immediately before the High Commissioner concerned.     70   If the above arrangements wore made, HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom  would ashHis Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions to  considerthe question of recommending equivalent precedence forany High Commissioner appointed  as their representative in a  Dominion.      13th October,  1950.
