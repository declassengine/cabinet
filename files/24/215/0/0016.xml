    Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     The general trade depression continued and on the wholeIncreased in intensity during the month.  The general level ofprices of raw materials remained low;  rubber and cotton sankto fresh records.  The disposition to order only for immediate requirements therefore continued.  Pew signs appeared of improved trade for the near future, but money remained verycheap and the opinion is expressed that this and the low pricesof raw materials are bound before very long to cause an alteration of feeling leading to increased demand.     The average weekly output of coal for the summer of 1930(June, July, August) was 4,208,000 tons, a drop of 12$ ascompared with the corresponding figure for 1929. Unemploymenthad in July 1930, reached 28.2$,  Exports  of coal during Julyfell off by nearly 21$.  The average prioe per ton, 16/8d.showed a slight inorease (9d.) over the price in July 1929, butthis is due to almost the whole of the coal being deliveredagainst contracts made at the end of 1929.  Polish coal is beinjsold at very low rates (ll/6d. f .0.b, for Best Coal) inoompetition with British and the average British price nextyear will, it is feared, be very much lower.     The Co-operative representative reports a decidedimprovement in the demand for coal at the end of August dueto advance in prices for September,-1-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS B HI TAHITI 0 MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.

     The outputs of both pig iron and steel for the month werethe lowest since 1926-  As regards the former, largequantities of Indian pig iron are coming into Glasgow,  and continental pig iron is offered at several shillings per tonless than the British price.     The iron and steel industry on the Continent is sufferingfrom extreme scarcity of new business and the announcement bythe International Steel Cartel at tho end cf the month thatsemi-finished material and joists were to be freed from controlmarks the end for the time being of the Cartel*s attempt toregulate prices.  Consequently prices fell heavily and continental steel joists can now be delivered in English portsat less than  5 per ton or nearly  2. 10.    below the Englishprice.  These prices are lower than the Continental home consumption prices and recently in B algium the export price for steel bars has been lower even than the home  (Belgian) pricofor billets.  Foreign competition has thus Intensified andtrade in general is still very poor.  The outlook contains very few encouraging elements.     Ship repairing has boen fairly good but new shipbuildingorders are still very scarce;  tonnage commenced during the june quarter was not much more than half that commenoedeither in the previous (March) quarter or in the June quarterof 1929.   The outlook is depressing, but it is added that theamount of pioneer and research work that is being carried outby the industry to maintain Its leadership is possibly greaterthan it has ever been.     The Freights Index has advanced but remains at 12$ belowthe 1913 average.  Increased shipping business is found onlyin grain from the Black Sea (Russia and  Roumania) whioh isbalanced by restriction of North American shipments;Australia is chartering for wheat but the soarcity of outwardfreight makes this business difficult,                               -2-
     Laid-up tonnage appears to remain about the same.     In the motor trade there is no improvement except thatexport is reported to be,  on the wholo,  more satisfactory.Many overseas markets arc overstocked with American cars butlosses consequent upon this position are resulting in a greaterdemand for British agencies in our Southern Dominions and, tosome extent, in Scandinavia.  ^The August figures for the exportof motor cars are not however very good7&quot;.     Railway traffic receipts for August (five weeks endodAugust 31) show substantial decreases in all the main groups ascompared with those for the corresponding period of 1929;  thototal decrease is 8.75$ and for merchandise minerals and livestook the fall is as much as 12.43$ (15.84$ for the L.N.E.Railway).   The decrease in the aggregate receipts for thofirst G months-of the year is 5 per cent.   Completed statisticsfor the first 6&quot; months of the year show that while tho freightroeeipts fell by 4.5$  the tonnage carried fell by only 3*$;pig iron tonnage fell by as much as 19.5$.     Reference has already been made to the increased shipment of grain from the Black Sea.  Wheat of exceptionally goodquality ha3 arrived from -Russia and shipments are increasingand helping further to reduce prices which during August fell byabout l/- a quarter.  Jfew crop conditions are favourable inCanada, Australia and the Argentine.     The recent fall in the price of cotton consequent upon theUnited States of America Bureau urop reports has checkedbusiness and no improvement in trade can be recorded.     Tho price of the raw material is also a dominant factor inthe wool trade.   Opening sales in Australia gave about the sameprices as in Juno, slightly better for bost quality, less forlower.   The Employer representative states that lack ofconfidence arises from the fact that wool is growing much
quioker than it is being consumed, while the labourropresentative referring to the now South African and australian wool clips that will be on tho market in thenext few wseks sayo that topmakers and importers areexpecting to buy the wool at reasonable prices but that the -financial reoources of the trade are restrioted.   Bothrepresentatives entertain hopes of at least some seasonalimprovement in tho trade in the near future.     Depression in other industries, e.g. stoel, artificial silk, necessarily produces the seme condition in the heavyohemioal industry, but glaso and soap making show progress.Sulphuric acid production, a useful index cf industrial activity, reached, for the first half of the year, 68.3 percent, of the maximum oapacity which, while slightly lessthan the 1929 figures, is better than those for 1925-8inclusive.     The Co-operative returns for four weeks ending August16, 1930, show a decline of 5.3 per oent. over those forthe corresponding period of 1929, but having regard to theheavy falls in price over the same period (o*g. 13 per cent.for sugar, 21 per cent, for flour) the actual volume oftrade would appear to bo greater.   The drapery trade,  wherethe decline is 18 per cent., is oauslng considerable anxietyowing to tho acuto unemployment in the North and miningdistricts.     During August the number of wholly unemployed increasedby 76,000 but the number temporarily stopped decreased by50,000,  the change in the total figures being from 2,011,467on July 28, to 8,039,702 on August 25,  out of a totalinsured population of 12,010,000.   The net increase whichwas somewhat larger than in tho corresponding period of 1929was almost entirely accounted for by an inoreaoe of 27,700in tho North Western Division;  smaller increases elsewhereboing counterbalanced by a fall in unemployed of 14,500 in wales.
     Statistics of trade in the Colonies show that while duringthe first few months of the year.the volume wf trade has fallenconsiderably, the percentage of imports from the UnitedKingdom has risen in the case of the Gold Coast, Kenya and uganda and Tanganyika.     It is not anticipated that the coup d&apos;etat in Argentinawill have untoward economic effects;  the commercial outlookthere has, however,  been dull for some time.  The similarevent in Peru is more directly attributable to trade depression     In Brazil there are no signs of improvement.     Chile is affected by the universal trade depression butmuch benefit in the future is expected from the conclusion ofan agreement between the Jhilean nitrate producers and the synthetic nitrogen interests in Europe for co-operation in marketing with the exception only of the United States ofAmerica.

OOHEIBBKTIAIi.COAL.FROM MR, BIDLS!f WARKAM.      The output of coal In the United Kingdom for the  three weeks ended August 83rd was as -under:    Week ended August  9th - 2,955,000 tons.  (Includes  August                                               Bank Holiday;     &quot;     &quot;     &quot;    16th - 4,702*000  &quot;     &quot;     11     &quot;    23rd - 4,717,000  &quot;      The average output for the thirteen reeks ended August 23rd (May Slst-August 23rd) was 4,202,000 tons, as compared  ith 4,773,000 tons for the corresponding period last  year.      The number of persons employed in the industry for the week ended August 23rd was 889,800.   The average for the thirteen weeks May 51st - August 23rd was 906,500, as compared with 931,200 for the corresponding period last year.     - Unemployment for the month of July was 28.2% as compared with 23.8/.; in June and an average of 16.2$ in 1929.      The quantity of coal exported from the United Kingdom in July (excluding Irish Free State) was 4,460,454 tons -as compared with 5,657,503 in July last year.  The average price per ton f.o.b. in July this year was 16/8 as compared with 15/11 last year.      It is interesting to see the comparatively high average price realised for export cool.  This is due entirely to the fact that almost the whole of the coal is being- delivered against contracts which were made at the end of last year.  We understand that the Poles are selling coal forward at extremely low rates (11/6 Per ton- f*o.b. for Best Goal) and we fear that the British average price next year will be very much lower.      The exports by sea from Poland in July were 762,000* tons, as compared with 615,000 tons in June.FROM SIR WALTER RAIKE.     The Durham Goal Trade he s been very quiet during the paBt few weeks,  and there has  been  much idle time.  Itis poor consolation to  say that some of  the other districts have&quot; suffered  even worse, but  there is  no doubt that even in the Summer time, there IB always a demand for Gas and  Coking Coalsa  The sooner  the arrangements are made.for  the carrying out of the coal Mines  Act, the better for  the trade, because there  xs a great amount of uncertainty ,  and  practically  no forward business can be done.
FROM MR. MITCHELL.     As regards the Coal trade, there Is no improvement.It was hoped that there would be a better demand as  the season advanced but the hope has not been fulfilled.IxlOl-T AilD STEEL.PROM MR. WALMSLEY.     The seasonal dullness which usually characterises theIron and Steel trades in August has been intensified thisyear by the continuance of the world economic depression.It is estimated that the output of Pig Iron in the UnitedKingdom in August was about 425,000 tens compared with486,000 tons in July and 682,000 tons in August 1^30 .  Steeloutput is estimated at about 455,000 tons against 621,000tons in July and 753,000 tons in August last year.  Theoutput figures for August this year were the lowest whichhave been reached since the period of the general strike.     The Iron and Steel Industry on the Continent also suffered from the general lack of activity.  The volume ofnew business was extremely scarce and many of the importantworks are in urgent need of fresh orders.  During the monththere were signs of further restriction of output.  in belgium, for example, the Sambre et Moselle Co. announcedits intention of damping down three of its seven blastfurnaces, and in Germany certain departments of many of theleading works were closed down and hundreds of workers weredismissed.     The announcement by the International Steel Cartelat the end of August that semi-finished material and Joistswere to be freed from control marked the end for the timebeing of the Cartel&apos;s attempt to regulate prices, as Bars,Plates and Hoops were de-controlled at the beginning of July.The Management Committee of the Cartel, however, has not given up all hope of devising some method of price regula-tion for it is understood that the whole question will befurther explored at the next meeting on September 12th.     The fact that such price fixing arrangements a shave been devised have broken down at a time when they are most needed offers an example of the difficulty of maintainingstrict observance of price agreements during a period of depression, particularly those on an international basis.The immediate effect of the announcement of de-control was afurther weakening in the price  situation, anu very lowfigures are now quoted for export.  Billets are offered at -3.14.0. per ton, Steel Bars ana Joists at  4. 5. 0 per ton.O.B. Antwerp,  Continental Steel Joists can therefore be bought delivered English ports at less than  5.0.0 per ton,
21) 9which is nearly  2.10.0 per ton below the British price.It is doubtful whether Continental Makers are aotuallylosing money at these low levels.  Their prioes for home consumption are of course higher,  in Belgium we haverecently seen an exceptional position where the exportprioe for Steel Bars has been lower than the home price forBillets,  The normal extra for Bars over Billets is 12s/6d,to 15s/- per ton.     The position in the main districts in the UnitedKingdom is summarised below:     Horth East Coast * During the past month there hasbeen little aotivity, demand from both home and abroadbeing at an extremely low level, and order books have inconsequence showed a further decline.  The reduction in theprioe of pig Iron has, however, brought out a few orders,and greater activity is anticipated now that the holidayperiod is at an end.  Severe competition from Continentalproducers is reported.     Trade in finished Steel has also been on a veryrestricted scale ana competition on both the domestic andforeign markets has  continued very keen for the small amountof available business.  The depression in the shipbuilding industry continues and the firms engaged in constructionalengineering work are oomplaining of a shortage of orders.It is hoped that a certain amount of railway and  engineeringwork vill be forthcoming  in the near future as consumers hevebeen limiting  their  purchases during the summer months.     Scotland.  The  present stagnation in both home  and export&quot;trade&apos; in Scotland.is such as has been seldomexperienced in that  oountry.     The shipyards on  the Clyde  and  elsewhere  are at  thepresent  time working on vessels  that for the most part arenearing completion and launched  tonnages will, it is feared,soon show a substantial reduction.  There is no improvementin structural  and  general engineering.     South Wales.  Conditions have become worse during^ thepast month and new orders placed have been on  a very low level,  while  enquiries are very  limited.  The  makers  ofGalvanised Sheets  have very poor  order books and  there seems little  likelihood of any  improvement  in  the near  future. TheTinplate market  is also unsatisfactory,  buyers are  holdingoff  the market as  much as possible and confining  theirpurohases  to  cover immediate requirements in  the  hope ofobtaining  lower  quotations.  MakerB  of heavy Steel products report  a continued scaroity of jjpecif i oat ions .     The Midlands.   In the Birmingham district  the collapse of  the  Gartel&apos;s  oontrol  over  prioes has  led to  an intensification of foreign competition and a further decline in quotations.  At the present  time  prices are said  to be  a matter of  individual bargaining.   In the  Sheffield district there  are  no  signs yet of the  seasonal  Improvement  in business which has been anticipated  and  buying,  even for ourrent needs, continues  at a  very low  level.
PROM MR. PUGH.     Employment has been affected in August by the holidayarrangements, and in most districts the usual week&apos;s stoppage hasbeen extended.  At ths end of the month there was a very slightimprovement in trade noted, and. according to reports received,manufacturers are a little more hopeful that orders will continueto increase     Pig Iron Trade.- This trade shows no sign of improvement and in Scotland is particularly bad; out of thirteen groups ofblast furnaces V/hich are completely idle, only at two works is there any likelihood of resumption of operations in the near future.  Pigiron from the Continent and India is still coming into Glasgow.     Heavy___Steel Trade.- There has been no change of importancein this section of the industry.  In the North of England onlyone Melting Shop has (with the exception of holiday week) beenfully engaged, other works have had froo. one-sixth to three-quarters of their furnaces working.  In the Lincolnshire andSheffield areas work has been, comparatively speaking, very good,onemelting shop closed down at the end of July but two of its furnaceswere put into commission again during the last week of August andother shops are working fairly consistently with less than thefull complement of furnaces and the men sharing the work available.In Monmouthshire only one works has worked.full time and in SouthWest Wales five melting shops have been fairly well engaged and four are completely shut down although one of these is expected tore-open during the early part of September.   The rolling mills onthe whole have been but fairly well engaged.  In the Morth ofEngland two or three establishments have had their mills workingfifteen shifts per week but the majority are working about halftime with the men sharing the work available.     Wrought Iron Trade.-   The puddling and malleable iron trade&quot;remains in a very poor state, works throughout the country areonly working intermittently.     Sheet Trade.-  Employment, generally, was bad in thissection.  In Scotland one of the two principal works had its full complement of ten mills working full time.  The otherestablishment has had six mills in operation out of a total ofthirteen.  In Soath Wales and Monmouthshire six works are completelyidle and the largest works in the area since closing down for thewhole of Bank holiday week has only worked each week fromWednesday to Saturday inclusive.     Tinplate Trade.-  The volume of production has been lessthan for the previous month but in the last week  there was anincrease in shipments from Swansea.     Crucible and Light Steel Trades.- Generally speaking thelight steel trades of Sheffield have been more depressed duringthe month than has been the case hitherto.&apos;     Tube,,Trade.- The tube trade has only been fairly well engaged.                          P1ROM. MR^JHl^PPrPL.     As regards Pig Iron, several furnaces have been put out of blastThere are fewer furnaces in operation than have been for a very long period.     In the Steel trade the demand as very poor and practically allthe Works are working short time.  There is little prospect of animprovement as few shipbuilding orders have been placed.                               -4-
                     NON-FERROUS METALS.                   FROH CAPTAIN LYTTBLTON.     Copper;  Some small purchases of Electro took placeabout the middle of last month, hut the demand eased offconsiderably.  It is believed that the Railway Companiesmay be in the market on any signs of improvement:  alsothe wiredrawers who have been out of the market nearly allaugust, and who probably have some orders should there bea reduction in price.     Tin:  Considering the holiday period consumption seemsto be fairly normal in Birmingham.     lead:  Conditions remain very quiet.  The Liverpoolmunicipality has applied for borrowing powers up to  300,000for the purpose of new cable extensions, but the effectcannot be felt for some months.  We also hear from Liverpoolthat 200 tons of foreign material have been sold  inLancashire and Yorkshire.  A little more enquiry is reported from cable makers.     Spelter:  Demand for galvanising has been very quiet.No enquiry is reported from Swansea beyond present monthrequirements.  Birmingham mention a small business inRefined, but otherwise there is no change in conditions.SHIPBUILDING AND MARINE ENGINEERING.                   FROM SIR WALTER RAINS.     Shipbuilding orders are tapering off, and were it not that nearly all the Oil Tankers being built on the North-East coast, are having Motor-Engines fixed, which, of course,involves a tremendous amount of work compared to the Steam-Engine, there would be some thousands more people out of work.     It is satisfactory to note that shiprepairing bothon the East and West coasts, is fairly good.FROM SIR ERNEST GLOVER.     The only new contracts reported are for a passanger and cargo steamer for the Jamaica Fruit  Trade, acoasting passenger steamer for Scotland and a floating dockfor New Zealand.  No orders for tramp tonnage have beenplaced.   There are no later figures as to  tonnage under construction than those supplied last month.FROM MR . RICHMOND.     ^Thile the output figures of tonnage launched  and completed in August show a satisfactory total,  the index bywhich the prospects of the industry are to  be judged is thequantity of new work placed, and on this basis  the returns*o*-
give serious grounds for apprehension.  The slackening offin the placing of new orders has been intensified, and were it not for the Tanker tonnage, the position would be even worse than it is.  The closing down of the Beardmore Yard, also oneof Messrs. Harland and Wolffs Yards, and the drasticcurtailment of staff throughout the industry are evidencesthat the shortage of work i3 having its effect.  The reflec-tion of this is felt not only in the larger marine shops, butin independent auxiliary establishments of all kinds, so thatthe outlook for the coming winter i3 distinctly depressing.Enquiries are scarce, and although the Delegation from theSoviet Government is now visiting the Clyde, confirmation ofany orders actually arranged is 3tlll lacking.     Notwithstanding these discouraging conditions, theamount of pioneer and research work which is being carriedout by the industry to maintain it3 leadership is possiblygreater than it has ever  been.PROM MR. BARROXT.     There is no visible improvement in the shipbuilding industry,, indeed from reports in the Press we may gacher thatthings are getting worse.     Certainly we may take it that orders are not coming into replace work that is being finished and unemployment.in the various districts is very great.  The outstanding e^representative the moment is the announcement that Beardmore&apos;s Yard is tobe closed and that negotiations are proceeding for tho purchaseof several other yards for the purpose of closing them down.     It is held that this policy of concentration will ultimately benefit the industry, but the immediate result mustadd to the already great number of unemployed in theindustry and great hardship to those staff hands who havebeen a long time in the employment of these firae.     At the moment of writing Representatives of Russia are on the Clyde seeking to negotiate the placing of orders forseveral ships for Oil and Timber trades, we gather that thewhole matter hinge3 round the question of credits and one cannot be too opL.&apos;mist:..c as to the outcome, but it can only be hoped that some accomijmdaxion may be reached on the question,and work obtained, which would f-o some way to ease theunemployment in that area.MOTOR INDUSTRY.FROM SIR WILLIAM MORRIS.     It is difficult to appreciate conditions at this timeof year.   There is, however, no sign of improvement in thegeneral conditions reviewed in recent reports.
     Unemployment figures are considerably in excess of normal *    Current sries are undoubtedly lower than in thepast two years.     Production of heavy duty commercial chassis is below1939 figures, and although lighter trucks are not maintainingspring and summer figures, thoy are probably in excess of1929.     Export Is, on the whole, more satisfactory, andrepresents a growing proportion of output.   The stock position, however, of American oars and trucks in manyoverseas markets i3 excessive, and liquidation general.     There is considerable evidence of heavy losses by manyAmerican car distributors, and these are resulting in agreater demand for British Agencies in Hew Zealand, SouthAfrica and Australia, and, to some extent, in Soandinavia.                   PROM SIR OYRIL BUROOMB.     The number of motor vehicles (excluding motor cycles)newly registered In July, 1930, was 3,648 less than in thecorresponding period of 1929,   This decrease was made up asfollows,-                                 Increase (?-) or Decrease (-)   Oars taxed on horse-power....       -2,823   Goods vehicles..............       -  716   Motor hackneys..............       -  343   Other vehicles ..............       *   34-3,848     Motor Oycles newly registered In July, 1930, shewed adecrease of 1,466*00TT0P.FR0&amp; MR. H.W. LEE.     The tr-ade Is still in a most deplorable ocrndi-tion.There is no life whatever in any section of it, and thespindles and looms running show no improvement this month onthe past two months.     I am not able to inform the President of any freshdevelopments as yet regarding the Ootton Report, beyond sayingthat the report Is being most oarefully considered andanalysed by every section of the trade, and I should hopethat, before long, some definite Indication of their position may be given.
I  *r     264     We are having a meeting of the Joint Committee ofOotton Trade Organizations at the end of this month, and atthat meeting I hope the various sections may be able toreport to the Committee the present position of affairs, sothat it may be possible at the next meeting of the AdvisoryCouncil for me to be in a position to give some definite information.FROM SIR KENNETH STEWART.     August remained very quiet indeed in tho Ootton Tradeand it is difficult to reoord any improvement in results inany quarter.     The market has been dominated by the U*S.A. Bureaureports on cotton which have proved to be bearish andwhich have brought cotton down to a figure below anythingreoorded since 1914, just after War broke out*   This has caused everyone who could to abstain from business, as theyare afraid of further falls.     In such a featureless market, there is very little toreport.WOOL.FROM MR. HAMILTON * .     Employment during August was at a very low ebb, and machinery activity appears to have been very little betterthan during tho period of the textile strike, the figurebeing approximately 8 5$.   There are signs of a slightimprovement in wool oombing, but so far it has not reachedthe ether branches of the Industry,     There is a certain satisfaction in knowing that thedepression is not confined to this country, even Franceand Italy having been severely affected.   In the formercountry, a wages dispute is in progress, and from Italy oomereports of abnormally bad trade in the Textile Industry.  Atpresent, wool is growing much quicker than it is beingconsumed, and, as a result, there is considerable lack ofconfidence in values.  Unquestionably, the large quantity of artificial silk now being produced Is also contributing tothe fall in wool prices.     As against these faotors, it must be remembered thatbusiness in the Textile Trade generally increases in volumebetween the months  of september and April, and it Beerasnot unlikely that this seasonal improvement will begin totako effcot during the current month.
FROM ALDERMAN TITTBimiGTON.     Although there is not much improvement to report so faras employment is concerned, there seems to toe a rather more hopeful feeling in the wool-textile&apos; industry.  There is a fairly good output of fine tops and yarns, tout the ca?ossbredsection is very much under-employed.   In the dyeing tradethere is a very slight improvement in the slutotoing or yarn-dyeing section, tout the piece-dyeing section remains very unsatisfactory.     The new South African and Australian wool clips will toecoming on to the market in toulk in the ne:.t few weeks, andtopmakers and importers are expecting to &quot;buy the wool at reasonable prices.  If one looks &quot;back six months, fluctuations in wool values have been moderate in comparison with thepreceding two years,  dome neasure of stability seems tohave been reached in fine wools, and this should help toencourage users to buy mors freely.  Unfortunately thefinancial resources of the trade are severely restricted.I am told that some very good judges in the Bradford tradethink they ought to buy freely in Australia if prices areanything like satisfactory, but that they are handicapped by lack of credit, because the banks still take a pessimisticview.  It would, of course, handicap British trade a gooddeal if prices rose later in the season and the Continenthad filled up its requirements on a lower level.     Two very old-established firms of spinners and manufacturers have gone into liquidation since my last report.On the other hand, an up-to-date spinning mill, the proprietors of which went o,t of business a little time ago,has been bought by another spinning concern, which is anxiousto extend its plant because it has been working over-timefor many months.CHBSUDALS..FROM DR. CLAYTON.Heavy Chemicals.     The depression which overshadows all branches of theindustry is a reflection of the slump in the various chemicalconsuming trades throughout the country, and shows no reliablesigns of relief.     The export trade has been well maintained :  to most marketsin spite of hindrances caused by the fall in silver inChina, and in the Australian exchange, and the politicaldisturbances in India.  Competition in Japan from American andnative sources has made inroads into British exports of alkaliand lately severe Russian competition in alkali  products inSouth America has become manifest.* But of. p. 12 -9-
     In. the Home Trade there is a diminution in the consumptionof alkali products in almost every consuming trade, most markedlyin the manufacture of artificial silk;   the chief exceptions arethe glass and soap industries which are showing steady progress.     The chlorine market has remained steady and the demand forthis product at one time looked very promising, but the artificial silk industry apparently suffered a decline in the middle of theyear from which it is now beginning  to show signs of recovery.     The markets for hydrochloric, and, to a less degree,sulphuric acid have suffered owing to the depression in thegalvanizing, tin-plate, textile, and iron and steel trades.     The demand for saltcake has passed through two distinctphases this year, beginning with every prospect of a shortage ofthe product and arriving at the present time at a point wheresupply is likely to meet - if not to exceed - the demand.   Theprincipal consumers of this product are makers of pulp and kraftpaper in export markets, and these have apparently greatly over-estimated the consumption of their goods.     In some few directions there is said to be considerableoptimism, and it is understood that firms engaged in the dyeingand finishing of acetate silk goods are working on full time,while the artificial silk trade itself shows some slight signsof recovery, which will perhaps be aocentuated when the weakerbrethren have been shaken out.Sulphuric Acid Industry,     The state of the sulphuric acid industry has for long been regarded as a fair index of the general prosperity of tho country.Hence the statistics covering the first six months of the year(January to June) which are now available, are of considerablesignificance.   These figures relate to the United Kingdom andthe whole of Ireland;  all weights are expressed in tons of2,240 lbs. and Sulphuric Acid is expressed in terms of 100$ HgS04r.     During the period under review 463,000 tons of Acid weremanufactured, representing approximately 68.3,  of what may beconsidered the reasonable maximum productive capacity of theIndustry,     The following table enables these figures to be compared withthose of recent years:-                                                       % Of     Year,    Tons,                                  Capacity.     1925  - 848,000                                    59,0     1926  - 722,000                                    49.5     1927  - 889,000                                    62.4                    (1st half - 457,000                 66,4     1928  - 928,000(Sn(j ^   471,000                    (1st half - 468,000                 71,3     1929-- 967,000      ^ ^ 4i79,00?                 ^                    jlst half - 463,000                 68^3     1930           (     On the whole  it may be  considered that, in view of the greattrade depression through which we are passing, the figures arehigher than would have been  expected.
     In order to manufacture tne Acid produced, the followingquantities of imported RAW materials were consumed;-     Pyrites   - 178.600 tons, consisting of approx, 47$ Sulphur.     Brimstone -  21,000   &quot;        &quot;     &quot;     &quot;     98%    &quot;     Zinc oon-     oentrates -  58,000   &quot;        n     &quot;     &quot;     29$    &quot;     There was also consumed 85,200 tons of Spent  Oxidecontaining approximately 50$ Sulphur, which is the only rawmaterial for Sulphuric Acid manufacture produced in the UnitedKingdom, except possibly a very small quantity of  Pyrites pickedout in the course of ooal mining.     It may be of Interest to compare the quantities of SulphuricAcid manufactured in Great Britain and Ireland and in otherleading industrial countries.     The figures for 1929 are as follows:-                                       Tons.

The consumption of fertilisers is surprisingly goodconsidering the appalling state of the agricultural industry inall parts of the World, but at the same time naturally leaves agreat deal to be desired.Dye stuffs.     The consumption of dyes, and particularly of indigo, inthe home country shows a marked decrease, reflecting the depressionin the textile trades and in the printing and finishing of textilogoods.   In China the sale of indigo and dye stuffs has been rendered difficult by intense competition from American and other sources.     A reference requires to be made to the recently pubIIshodreport of the Dyestuffs Industry Development Committee  on thopresent position and development of the Dye stuffs manufacturing industry in Great Britain,   The report, which is unanimous,  Isan authoritative statement of the main facts regarding  theoperation of the Dyestuffs (Import Regulation) Act,  1930, andsets forth not only the remarkable progress which the,dye makingindustry has achieved, but also the difficulties  which  the ColourUsers have had to encounter, and the developments which are  still necessary to render this country independent of foreign suppliesof colour,   A memorandum on the subjoot has also been  published by the Colour Users, but the Dye Makers have refrained  fromissuing any statement of their case as they do not wish to
prejudice, in any way, the negotiations which are at present inprogress between the Makers and Users under the aegis of the Boardof Trade in regard to the future.     It is desirable, however, to draw attention to the discussion which took place at Bristol on Septembor 5th, In the scientificatmosphere of the British Association for the advancement of science, regarding the Dyestuffs Act,   The various speakersindicated the vital importance to the national welfare of thiskey industry from the points of view of scientific research andinstruction, industrial development and national safety, and pointed out the dangers that would arise If anything were done toprevent the consummation of the work which it was the object ofthe Dyestuffs Act to achieve.Fine Chemicals0     Home trade in drugs and fIne chemicals continues to be veryquieta   In regard to Export trade, all markets are sufferingfrom depression, slackness, and lack of buying capacity.     The Indian boycott of British drugs and chemicals, aftermore than four months, continues without any particular development.Foreign Trader     The exports of chemicals, drugs, dyes and colours for August,1930, show a serious drop of over  500,000 as compared with august 1929, when the figure was a little over  2,000,000, that isa decrease of 25fi,   When the total exports for the first 8 monthsof the year are considered, the drop is 10$ as compared with 1929$the main decreases during this period are in respect&quot;of coal tarproducts, sodium compounds, medicines and medicinal preparationsand painter!s colours and materials, while ammonium sulphate,copper sulphate, disinfectants, insecticides etc., glycerine anddyestuffs are similarly affected, but to a less extent.     The import trade for August shows a decline of roughly 450,000, or 27$ over August, 1929, while the total imports forthe first 8 months of 1930 are down 14$ on 1929, the main dropsbeing in respect of acetic anhydride, coal tar products, potassiumcompounds, sodium nitrate and drugs, medicines and medicinalpreparations,C conclusion^     In general, the most optimistic expression of trade that can be furnished from facts gleaned from the chemical industry Isthat the bottom of the depression seems - at any rate for the timebeing * to have been reached.   GENERAL TRADE0FROM SIR WALTER RAINS.     Generally speaking,  there is  a great  lack  of  confidence,caused through the belief that commodity prices will  go  stilllower.   It is hoped that cheap money  may  make  itself felt  in, asit were, reviving trade,  because this  faotor  combined with  thelow commodity prices., is  bound, before very long,  to  cause  an alteration of feeling, which, in Its turn, ought to bring anincreased demand for various commodities.m.....iiMiimBnmijMiMiiMW................................n....................i,n

During the month under discussion the cash receipts of theCo-operative wholesale Society are down approximately 6 percent, compared with twelve months ago, the prices of manycommodities also shewing a decrease, e.g.,                  Sugar is IS.97 per cent down.

The general textile and drapery trade is causing considerable anxiety, brought about by the unemployment problem, which is so acute in the North and mining districts.     In the general furnishing trade the decline continues? thedemand at the moment being for cheap and medium gradefurniture.   Higher grade furniture is not in demand.   We arehoping that after the holiday season this trade will shew animprovement.     The coal trade at the beginning ef the month still shewsa serious decline, although there is a decided improvement atthe end of the month in the demand, very largely brought aboutthrough the expected advance in prices for September.DISTRIBUTIVE TRADES.FROM SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE.Retail Trade Conditions - August 1950.     Conditions were seriously against retail trade in August.In the first -place, the weather was exceptionally unfavourable.The first three weeks were cold and wet, and affected turnover,but not so seriously as the extremely hot weather at the end ofthe month.   The heat had a disastrous effect on sales,especially in the West-End of London.     Secondly, the evidence of reduced purchasing power on thepart of the public has been very strong.   Reports from all parts of the country confirm that in spite of an increasing number of transactions, showing that a greater number ofcustomers had been served, the amount of each individual salescheck was substantially less than last year.   So far as theleisured classes are concerned, reduced dividends, combined with higher taxation, have left them with less spending power,  andso affected the turnover in the higher class trade, whileincreased unemployment is making itself more and more felt atthe other end of the trade.   The tourist traffic appears  tohave been less, and individual tourists were not of the wealthy
type, and had less money to spend.   This  factor has affectedwest-iaid trade, while the holiday resorts report that, owing tothe popularity of motoring holidays, visitors not only tend to spend a shorter time at each place,  to the detriment of localtrade, tut also spend their money in different directions.Lastly, the most important factor is probably the continued fallIn retail prices in all classes of commodities, which makes it increasing difficult to maintain the same volume of turnover.It is not surprising, therefore, that with one working day lessin the month the large section of retail trade represented &quot;by thedepartmental stores shows signs of falling off all over thecountry.Table.

HONEY MARKET.FROM LORD BRADBURY.     The month of July &quot;began with the financial ease thatis normal in the Market at the &quot;beginning of a new half-yearand bill rates fell but this was quickly checked by thedevelopment of weaaiess in the French Exchange and a renewal of shipments of gold to Paris.  This went on throughout themonth and drove the bill rate up to 2 ;o.     At the end of July the position of the French Exchangeat last improved and gold withdrawals from the Bank^ceased,although mast of the gold in the open market continued to be bought on French account.  Money beoame increasingly easyduring August, evidently owing to an increasing shortage of bills, and by the end of the month the bill rates had fallenpractically to 2fj.  Short bills in fact were even below Z%and it was evident that the Market was again working uponrates that were quite out of touch with the official Bank Rateof 3;..     There is a good deal of speculation as to whether theBank Rate will have to follow market rates downwards to 2- $or whether the equilibrium of the Market can be restored by a recovery In bill rates.  So long as the supply of short termmoney continues to be so much in excess of the demand for ita state of affairs  natural to a time of bad trade - there isno obvious internal reason for the bill rates to rise, butthis may be brought about again, as has frequently happened in the past, by the withdrawal of foreign balances from Londonowing to the low interest rates here and perhaps the consequentloss of gold by the Bank of England.     The state of the gold reserve is not unsatisfactoryin spite of the renewed drain to France.  The reserve wasabout  155,000,000 on 27th August compared with  135,000,000a year ago, when *the gold reserve had been seriously depletedbecause of the Stock Exchange boom in New York.  Since the endof April when this year&apos;s drain of gold to France began, theBank&apos;s nett loss of gold is about  8,000,000.     As regards the Stock Exchange, the Gilt Edged markethas been showing firmness owing to a steady investment demand and to the influence of cheap money.  Towards the end ofAugust there was some revival in Home Railway stocks andIndustrial shares but this is said to be largely professionalwithout much public buying behind it.FROM SIR GUY GRAliET.     The stringency which prevailed in the Money Market duringthe early part of August owing to the holiday demand forcurrency, proved to be of short duration,  money becomingunusually plentiful about the middle of August, and has beeneasy for the past three weeks.  In view of the comfortableconditions experienced by the market the rate for day to daymoney declined from 2%&apos;o to as low as 1^6 at one time, exceptfor loans from the Clearing Banks who have endeavoured tomaintain their standard rate of 2J*.  They have,, however,                            -17-
latterly had difficulty in lending their funds at this rate and have consequently had -to make heavy piirchases of shortdated bills, which has brought the three months bill ratedown from 2 3/8fJ to 2[l last week.  However, quotations becameslightly firmer on the higher rate of 2 l/8^ at whic h theTreasury Bills were allotted on September 5th, when  45,000,000wore offered by the Treasury, which is  10,000,000 more than was offered in any of the previous five weeks.  The depressedstate of trade is to a great extent responsible for thepresent situation, as twelve months ago the advances of the clearing Banks were  36,000,000 higher than at present, andtheir d-posits have increased by  14,000,000 during the sameperiod.  From these figures at would appear that the fundsrequired by the Clearing Banks for the financing of currentbusiness amount to about  50,000,000 less than a year ago.     Business in the Stock Exchange until the beginning ofSeptember was practically at a standstill with the exceptionof the gilt edged Market, whioh continued to be influenced bythe investment of money not required in trade.  The advent ofSeptember witnessed a mild revival of business In IndustrialStocks.  This movement- is said to be mainly of a professionalcharacter, and is attributed to bear covering operations andthe purchase by financial concerns of some of the leading shares,the price of which had been unduly depressed in the recentslump in values.     Owing to the holiday season there is nothing of interestto report in connection with new capital issues.       SHIPPING.PROM SIR ;3RN53T GLOVMR.     The freight market generally has remained without material change, the slight improvement noted a month ago in some homewardmarkets being maintained.  The Index Number, due no doubt to thatimprovement, has advanced from 77 to 88 and is thus 12; o belowthe 1913 average.     The Argentine for grain homewards has been an active marketbut outward, coal freights have fallen further and there is no improvement to record in the general cargo trade.     South Africa.   The demand for tonnage for shipment of maizehas fallen off and rates have consequently receded.     Aja^tpjulia. is a charterer for wheat both for early positions and for the new crop but the difficulty of finding outwardfreights to combine renders business&apos; very difficult as charterersare not willing to pay freights high enough to tempt steamers togo out in ballast.     India, continues very cull.  Regular liners are only aboutnaif filled and consequently there is little opportunity forchartering outside tonnage.  The anticipated monsoon activity inthe outward market has not materialised.
     Canada and North America..   The demand has fallen offconsiderably and business&quot; is very restricted.     Black Sea (Russia) and Danube (Roumania).  Heavy shipments of grain have to be recorded and this probably accounts tosome extent for the falling off of American shipments as it isstated these shipments from Russia have been made irrespective of prices obtainable in the consuming markets.     Outward coal freights.  There is no improvement in any direction.  All such freights have such a heavy loss that thetendency to send steamers out in ballast is growing in variousdirections.  As an instance of low outward freights theAdmiralty fixture at S/- Wales/-Simonstown may be noted.  Thismeans one ton of coals is carried 100 miles for one penny.     Shipment of Coals^.  Exports for July show an advance of600,000 tons&quot;on June 1930 but a reduction of 800,000 as comparedwith July 1929.  Bunker Coals also are in excess of June 1930but below July 1929.     Laid up tonnage.  There is no later figure for the UnitedKingdom thanthat supplied last month.  The amount is probably not very different.  The United States have however beencompiling some statistics which indicate that excluding theunemployable tonnage laid up in America there is a total of laidup tonnage in the World of 5,830,000 d.w. tons.  This is inexcess of any estimate made here.     I attach the usual statistical statement with regard totonnage under construction, launched and commenced.    Index number of Shipping Freights.

FROM MR. PHILLIPS.     There was a further increase In unemployment  during august,  - The total number of persons on the Registers ofEmployment Exchanges increased by 28,235 from 2,011,467 at28th July to 2,039,702 at 25th August,   The numbers whollyunemployed increased by 75,868, the number temporarily stoppeddecreased by 50,376, while those normally in casual employmentwho were unemployed increased by 2,743,
     During the period the number of men on the  Register  Increasedby 5,901, the number of women by 12,270 and the  number  ofjuveniles by 10,064,     With the exception of Scotland and Wales the  numbers unemployed at 11th August were considerably higher than at28th July, largely owing to holiday suspensions.   In the Londonand South Eastern and in the South western Divisions there  wasa decrease in the following week but this was followed by afurther rise so that at 25th August tho numbers  had increased  toabout 5,600 in tho London and South Eastern Division as comparedwith 28th July, while in the South Western Division there was  anet increase of about 3,600,     In the Midland Division the numbers unemployed decreased  in both the following weeks and at 25th August were about  90 fewer than at 28th July,   In the North Eastern Division the  increaseshown at 11th August had disappeared on 18th August, but a  sharprise took place on 25th August and the figures for that datewere about 9,500 higher than at 28th July,     In the North Western Division there was a continuous increasethroughout the month and the numbers unemployed  at 25th Augustwere 27,700 higher than at 28th July,   In Scotland there was  adecrease of 12,100 at 11th August, but successive  increases had at 25th August reduced this decrease to 3,800,   In Wales therehas been a continuous decline and tho numbers unemployed at25th August were 14,500 lower than at 28th July,     The increased unemployment during the month is again largelyaccounted for by the coal mining and catton textile industries,but a detailed analysis for the various industries is not yet available,     The total number of insured persons in employment  at 21stJuly is estimated provisionally to be about 120,000 less than  at23rd June, and about 687,400 less than at 22nd July, 1929,Figures for 25th August are not yet available.

Since my report to the Council of a month ago,  a drasticpolitical change has occurred in Argentina,  the Government  underPresident Irigoyen having been overthrown cn 6th instant.   Tothose closely observant of Argentine affairs,  this  did not  comealtogether as a surprise, and fortunately the coup  d&apos;etat hastaken place without civil war or serious casualties,  a provisional Administration having been formed with  a MilitaryPresident, but the Cabinet containing also a number of
influential civilians.   In connection with these events, it may-he pointed out that changes of Government frequently take placein South America without necessarily involving great disturbanceof commercial activity and basic business conditions.   This isparticularly true of Argentina, where a sanguinary revolutionwould be quite out of accordance with popular ideas or herhistory of stability for very many years past.   It is satisfactory to observe that the new Administration has apparently been well received throughout the country, and the prompt - and apparently welcome - acceptance of a new regime, together withthe fact that the Provisional Government is reported to be composed of strong and influential elements, is believed to be significant of expectations of a more active and efficient administration in the future.     The latest complete official returns of the foreign trade of the country, which relate to the early part of the current year,  show that a reduction in the aggregate value of imports was more than offset by diminished exports,  imports in january and Pebruary last having totalled, on the basis of customsvalues, 135,915,583 pesos (gold), against 147,846,215 pesos inJanuary and Pebruary, 1929, whilst the &quot;real&quot; value of exportswas 135,779,541 pesos (gold), against 190,611,423 pesos. &quot; Therewas thus an excess of imports for the period this year amountingto 136,042 pesos (gold), as compared with a surplus of exportsof 42,765,208 pesos in the first two months of 1929.    While,therefore, political considerations may have recently affectedexchange adversely, the drop over some months is fundamentallydue to the change in the Republic&apos;s balance of payments.     The Argentine agricultural situation appears generally satisfactory, weather conditions having been favourable to the growing crops.    In view of the political changes, it is naturally difficult to gauge the commercial outlook for the timebeing, but any decided improvement from the dull conditions inevidence for some time must be mainly dependent upon  theresults accruing from the marketing of next season&apos;s  harvest, whichwill commence towards the close of the j^ear.     Advices from Sao Paulo, Brazil, state that the generalsituation shows no sign of improvement.   During the  course of thepast month,  exchange showed an easier tendency, and fell at onetime to a fraction under 5d. per milreis,  no official operations,apparently,  being undertaken to support the rate.   There havebeen reports to hand of unsettlement in the Brazilian politicalBphere, but it may be taken that the disturbances have been of alocal and minor character.   In regard to the import  trade,there is still a tendency to restrict the placing of  fresh orders,and, in this respect, any early improvement must depend upon more satisfactory conditions being attained in the export  markets foe.coffee.     In regard to Chilean conditions, it is satisfactory to observe that the desired objective has been attained  at the conferences in Europe between the Chilean producers of nitrate ofsoda and the synthetic nitrogen interests, an agreement havingbeen reached whereby there will be co-operation in marketingthroughout the world, with the exception only of the  United statesand dependent or adjacent territory.   Doubtless this agreement will in the future redound to the benefit of the Chilean nitrateindustry, with a correspondingly favourable effect upon the prosperity of the country generally, but the commerce of theRepublic for the time being is affected by the universal trade
depression, and, in particular, by reduced nitrate exports andthe fall in copper prices.   It is now officially stated that,in order to maintain the economic situation of the Republic,special measures will be undertaken, including a temporary increase in import duties on goods not of X^rime necessity or which may be obtained in Chile.     Shortly prior to the coup d&apos;etat in Argentina, a similarevent occurred in Peru, the Government of President Leguia beingsuddenly deposed and replaced by a military Junta.   In this instance, the recent trend of politico-financial affairs amid a prolonged economic crisis caused by the low world prices for  thecountry&apos;s principal products, namely, cotton, sugar, copper,and petroleum, induced in observers anticipations which werefulfilled in the change of administrative regime.   Inconsequence of the unsettlement, the exchange value of the currencydepreciated at one time to 15,05 soles to the   sterling, but,with a clarification of the political atmosphere, the rate hasnow improved to 14,00,   Peru has undoubtedly been seriously affected by the world slump in primary products, and it istherefore difficult to see how her trade will improve unless  anduntil international markets recover.     Colombian conditions have recently been affected by afurther tightening of credit and by an easier tendency in thecoffee market.   The commercial situation generally in theRepublic is stated to be very depressed.   The Financial Missionunder the direction of the United  States financial expert,Professor Kemmerer, which is to undertake a comprehensiveinvestigation into economic conditions in Colombia, was due toarrive in Bogota during August.     Conditions in the Venezuelan commercial markets are dull,but prospects for the next coffee crop continue to be excellent,whilst a more satisfactory cocoa harvest is anticipated.     In &quot;flcuador. some improvement is reported in general commercial conditions.   Stocks of imported goods are stated  tobe reduced, although fresh orders are limited to small quantities to cover immediate requirements.     The commercial situation in Nicaragua continues unfavourable,and no improvement is anticipated prior to the commencement ofthe coffee harvest in November,     Guatemalan conditions continue dull;  the next coffee cropis expected to be favourable, both as regards quality and quantity, but there may be some reduction in the total output ascompared with that of last season.
