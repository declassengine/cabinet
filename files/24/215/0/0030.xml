(Sgd.)-  K.P.A. BANK3Y;                               Secretary, Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,     October 8th, 1930.
                                        Capital Steel Works,                                              Sheffield.                                           1st October 1930.  The Rt. Hon. J. Ramsay Lac aonald, M.?.        10, Downing Street,             London, S.W.1.  My a ear Prime Minister,            After careful  investigation of the position in  the Worth, I am forced to  the conclusion:  1.   That our industrial  and  commercial economic situation is  steadily deteriorating and  if this continues,  in a few months  time,  we shall be on the verge of a  debacle.  2.   The steps which will have to bo taken are,  in my view, so  grave,  that  it becomes a question whether  any  ona party can  carry  them, through,  and  whether some form  of Coalition Government  is  not  imperative to meat the crisis which is  rapidly developing.  3.   I  feal that  we should cease the  publication of unemployment  figures  altogether.  They are  having a  bad  psychological  effect  at home,  and  an  extremely bad  offoot on our  trade, owing to  countries  abroad  taking  thera  as a measure  of our  inability to  c omp e t e . 4..  I do not believe that we can go  on paying unemployment benefits of one kind or another ot the present rate and owing  to the pressure of conditions,  we shall be compelled to extend  tho period  which a person has tc be out of work before the benefit becomes payable,  and further,  unless  our situation improves, we may  yet bo driven back  by necessity to relieving necessity and not  paying for unemployment.   When one realise.-:  we are spending today on this  one question alone,  over one  hundred million pounds,  i.e. more than  half  our  Budget in IS12/1913,  it  becomes evident  we  cannot  continue. 5.  In spite of cheap money and  low cchmiodity prices,  there is no sign of  impro/ewent and as far as  one can see, no likelihood cf expansion in any country abroad which could help our exporttrade in the immediate future.- a. -
6,   I fear the Chancellor of the Exchequer is going to face grave difficulties when it comes to the collection oftaxation between January and the end of March next year andthat the pressure which he will have to put on if he is to collect anything like his anticipated Budget, will have afurther depressing effect on trade and restrict expenditurecn enterprise and on renewals and reconstruction.?.   I do not believe that the country can go on bearing thepresent burden of taxation and compete for the world1 s trade,certainly not in its present form, and I conceive that next spring,faced with the country&apos;s requirements, we may be compelled to cast on one side all cur pre-conceived ideas of free trade and protection etc. and put on a tariff of 10,15 or SO per cent on ail manufactured goods as a matter ofrevenue and necessity.  If this was done, it would evade thetariff truce to which we have just committed ourselves.3,   At last the depression has penetrated to the shelteredtrades.9.   I am having brought to my attention every day, dozensof cases where our cost of production is so high that wecannot compete and it is obvious that we are not able to-secure our normal share of such trade as is available andare, in fact, steadily  losing ground all round.10,  I should be surprised if my view of the gravity of thesituation is not borne  out by the statements made by membersof the Advisory  Committee of the Board of Trade at their last meeting.11.  Under these circumstances I feel very strongly  that what-we w.ant  is a Sound Table Conference on our own Home  affairs.
     A carefully prepared memorandum setting forth cur economic position at the present time and containing such information as is presented at the Advisory Committee of the Board of Trade would be the first step.     I then feel deeply that a Conference between you and your colleagues, Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Lloyd George with five or six each of their principal colleagues to at least examine the situation and let everybody appreciate where we are going is the next step.     If, after that, any one party feels itself strong enough to face the situation alone and tame the steps that are necessary to effect :    (a)  DRASTIC ECONOMY    (b)  Pace REDUCTION OP OUR STANDARD OF LIVING, which.will lead to reduction of wages and possibly increase ofhoars, . all of which may be forced upon us if we are to again become an industrially competitive nation. IS.  Reconstruction, rationalisation and that type of attack on the present problem is not alone sufficient and ifmanufacturers are convinced that under present conditions our cost of production cannot be made competitive, there is no inducement for them to sink more money in improved machinery, plant, or further sales organisation. 13.  I feel that as a member of your Advisory Council it ismy duty to tell you what my convictions are, and to let you know what is passing in my mind, and in doing so, if I have been compelled to trench on political questions as well as economic, I know you will realise it is because I feel we are approaching a situation that is so grave that it compares with the War, when we were compelled to act.together in self-defence.                 Yours s i nc erely,                    (Signed)    A. BALFGUH.                      -3-
