THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MJUESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1930.SECRET.Copy No.   OOCP. 302  (30).CABINET.PROPOSED TARIFF CONFERENCE  BET^                       THE  WEST  INDIES.between  CANADA  ANDMEMORANDUMM  BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.    AS the subject dealt with in this memorandum may possibly come up at theImperial Conference, I think it right to communicate it to my colleagues, although.it does not appear to me to call for any immediate decision or action, and certainlyno public declaration.    It will be remembered that  reciprocal preference between the West Indies,British Guiana, British Honduras and, subsequently, Bermuda (herinafter referredto as the participating Colonies)  and Canada has existed since 1912, and  that its terms were revised in 1920 and 1925.   The existing agreement, dated the 6th July,1925, is expressed to remain in force for twelve years at least.  It provides not only for reciprocal preference in accordance with schedules, but also for new or increasedsteamship services, which have since been brought into operation.  The preferencesgiven by Canada are upon sugar, bananas, cocoa, and a number of other West Indianproducts.   The preferences given by  the West Indies are on  flour, butter, cheese,lard, condensed milk, preserved fish and other articles.  Most of these articles arenot imported from the United Kingdom in  any considerable quantity, but there are some articles scheduled for the eastern Antilles  which  are largely  manufactured in the United Kingdom, such as cement, and boots and shoes.    The  existing preferential  rates given by the participating Colonies are allEmpire-wide, except in Jamaica, where they extend only to  Canada, the UnitedKingdom,  and a scheduled  list of Dominions  and  Colonies.  The Canadianpreference  extends  to the  United Kingdom, and  a similar scheduled list, which includes  the participating Colonies,  certain other  Colonies,  and most of  theDominions,  while a special preferential rate is accorded to  Australia  and  NewZealand,  though part of the latter is being withdrawn from New Zealand.   Canada,has recently granted free entry  to  Empire fresh fruits  and vegetables.   this concession was greatly appreciated  in the West  Indies, at least  in  the  easternAntilles.   At the instance of the  Governor of Barbados, the Governor of Trinidadcalled a Conference  to consider the possibility of making some  return to Canada inthe shape of further tariff concessions.  The Conference met in Trinidad  in june last.   British  Guiana  and all the participating  Colonies,  except  Jamaica, were represented, or sent messages offering co-operation.  Jamaica, however, consideredthat a Conference at that time was premature.    The  Conference passed a Resolution in favour of holding a further Conference-in Canada  at the earliest possible date for  the purpose of establishing  closer trade relations  between  the parties concerned.  It was generally agreed that steps shouldbe taken  to secure for Canada a considerable proportion of the trade which is nowenjoyed by,the United  States of America and other countries  outside the Empire,and it was considered that this could be done by a readjustment  of existing tariffs.    The Barbados delegates advocated as a last resort a third schedule in the tariffs,which would give to  Canada a preference over other parts of the  Empire, and pointedout that during the negotiations which led up  to the 1925 Agreement, Mr. Wiseman,on behalf of the  Colonial Office,  had made a pronouncement showing that such a[21691]
measure would not be opposed by the Home Government.  The delegates from theother Colonies were strongly of the  opinion that, if  possible,  the suggested third schedule should be avoided.   They realised, however, that in conducting negotiationsfor concessions which were essential  for the preservation of an industry of vitalimportance to Barbados and British  Guiana (namely, the sugar industry), it mightbe necessary to concede a third schedule as a last resort.  They decided that the latter was a concession which could only be made  if demanded as a  sine qua non hy theCanadian Government.     The following is  the text  of  the statement made with the authority of theSecretary of State, then Mr. Amery, by Mr. Wiseman on the 30th June, 1925, at theCanada-West Indies Conference in Ottawa :          &quot; The Secretary of State, whom I represent, is most anxious to do every-     thing he can to facilitate the commercial relations between  the West Indies and     Canada, and while I am here primarily in the capacity of an observer, I want to     do everything I can with the limited means at my disposal to help both sides to     arrive at  an  agreement  satisfactory to  both.  That is  the only  interest His     Majesty&apos;s Government have in this Conference, that is, that an agreement satis-     factory to both sides may be  arrived at, which  will facilitate to the utmost     possible  extent the trade relations between  Canada  and the West Indies.  By     strengthening the bonds which unite these parts of the Empire, one to the other,     His Majesty&apos;s Government feel  that the interests  of  the whole Empire are     promoted.         I might just add one little illustration of that.  So anxious was the Secretary     of State to facilitate the agreement between Canada and the Colonies that I was     instructed that if  the Colonies felt that it would in any way make it difficult     for them to extend an increased preference to the Mother Country as well as to     Canada,  the Mother Country  would not in that case insist on the  preference     being extended to her.    That is a departure from  the  policy which has been     adopted by previous Secretaries of State.   I have already explained it to the     West Indian delegates,  and I think perhaps it is only right that I should explain     it on an occasion when representatives of the Canadian Government are here,     as I think it affords the best proof of the cordiality I cannot think of the right     word, because I am not very good at speaking-with which  Mr. Amery welcomes     the efforts which have been made to strengthen the  bonds  which unite the two     parties,  one with the other.&quot;     If, as the result of a forthcoming Conference with  Canada, the participatingColonies should actually desire to discriminate  against  the Mother Country, therewould be great difficulties in preventing them.  In the case of several of the Coloniesconcerned the only power which the Secretary  of State has to invoke is that ofdisallowing  laws.  This power has  proved of  little value in conflicts  with theLegislature,  since it can usually be nullified by  &quot; tacking.&quot;   But, in any case, thedisallowance  of a general Tariff Ordinance would provoke a  constitutional crisis.In other Colonies, where the Secretary of State has power to procure the amendmentof a Tariff Ordinance, the power could not be exercised in a matter of so much importance without a similar result.     The difficulties of proceeding in the matter by force ma j en-re appear insuperable,and even if this was not the case, it is questionable whether it would be expedientso to proceed.  There is in the West Indies widespread and acute disappointmentand dissatisfaction that His Majesty&apos;s Government have not been able to deal withthe present crisis by way of direct  assistance to the sugar industry.   There would hedistinct danger in making a substantial addition to  present discontents under theattentive eyes of the United  States.     The best prospect of avoiding tariff discrimination against the United Kingdom would appear to be to reaffirm, when occasion arises, the policy voiced by  Mr. Wise-man in 1925,  and to  trust to the  goodwill of the Colonies  concerned.  But if HisMajesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain should  decide upon any alteration in that policy, it is clear that an announcement ought to be made before a further Conference is convened.     At present there is no  example of tariff discrimination by a Colony against the United Kingdom, but it is possible  that such discrimination may  be proposed in negotiations now pending between Fiji and New Zealand.  The Secretary of state has informed Fiji that such discrimination cannot be allowed, but the question may very probably be  raised again in the  course&apos;of negotiations.
                                                                        r      129                                      3    Without any suggestion that the importance of the principle is to be measured by the magnitude of the instance, it may be added that it has been calculated that if British imports into the participating Colonies in the last year for which statistics are available (usually 1928) had been subject to the general tariff instead of the preferential tariff, the extra amount payable in import duties would have been  620.000.  The corresponding  extra amount which  would have  been paid on the imports into the United Kingdom from the participating Colonies, if they had been foreign goods, is  700,000.    It will have been observed that Jamaica did not take part in the Conference, and I understand that it will be difficult for her to harmonise her interests with those of the other participating Colonies.  It appears that the advantage which  Canada chiefly desires is the free entry of flour into Jamaica, but that the free  entry of fruit and vegetables into  Canada is of little  value  to  that Colony.   Jamaica is  not unwilling to join in the proposed Conference, but does not wish to take the lead in approaching the Government of Canada.    In these circumstances, the  Governor of Trinidad has requested me to take steps to convene a Conference, but I have  intimated that at the moment I do not see my way to do so.    It may be added that the main object of most of the participating Colonies in this matter is  to secure tariff advantages for their sugar in the Canadian  market, and that in order  to attain this object it  will be an essential  preliminary that  aprivate agreement  should be concluded  between the  West Indian sugar producers and the Canadian refiners.  As the Canadian preference on sugar already  exceedsthat of the United Kingdom, the West Indian producers would not, in the  absenceof such an agreement, be able to secure any appreciable benefit from an increase inthe Canadian  preference.  Evidently, however,  neither the Colonial  Governmentsnor His Majesty&apos;s  Government  should  take any part in the negotiations for suchan agreement.                                                                         P.   Colonial Office, September 15,  1930.
