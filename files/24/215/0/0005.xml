175 THIS DOCUAIEKT IS THPROPERTY OF his BRITANNIC  MAJESTY13GOVERNMENT)S E C R E TC,?.  505(30)COPY NO.  U-1CABINET.BULK PURCHASE AND IMPORT BOARDS.Note by.....the Chancellor of ;the Exchequer.The two memoranda on Bulk Purchase and ImportBoards (CP. 887(30)) which have &quot;been prepared as briefsfor the use of United Kingdom Ministers at the ImperialConference are to &quot;be considered by the Cabinet in the concrete and final conclusions until we have the  Australianproposals before us, but there are nevertheless certainfundamental issues on which we&apos;ought to know where  we  standbefore the Conference meets and I  have therefore  propoundedthe following questions in the hope that they may serve tofocus our discussions on the subject.    It  will be  seen thatI have for the moment confined myself to the singlecommodity of wheat.   If as Australia seems to contemplateit is not f question of wheat alone but of  meat,  wool  and sugar as well further complicated  considerations  would arise.immediate future.Of course it is difficult to arrive  at(Intd,)  P.S.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.September 11th,  1930.What is the object they are meant to secure?          Is it (a) lower prices for the  consumer  or  (b) higher
176prices for the producer.   ,/lf (a)  there will he  no advantage to producers, and if (b) the consumers will have  to paymorej          If the object is higher prices for the  producer, are such higher prices to &quot;oe paid not only to the home hut  also tothe Empire producer.   If so, sinoe the Empire can supplymore than our total needs in wheat, on what basis are theprices paid to be fixed, and how arc our requirements to  be allocated between the different parts of the Empire.  Is  itintended that prices paid should have any relation to costs ofproduction, and, if so, how are such costs to be  ascertained.If all our wheat is obtained from the Empire, what will be theeffect on our trade with foreign countries (particularlyArgentina) from whom we now obtain nearly 40 per cent of our supplies.What is to be the nature of the Import Board?          Is it to be a Government Department or  a statutoryCorporation free from political influence.  Is it to be financed by Votes of Parliament or is it expected that  the banks will finance it or that it will obtain capital in the open market by an issue of stock.   How much capital will it need.   Will the Board be required to conduct its business sothat neither profit or loss is shown0   (Presumably it  *rillanyhow be expected to provide the Exchequer with  the equivalent of what is now paid in taxation by private enterprise).Will it be given power to take over the business  of the millers and the bakers.   Presumably it will have to begiven a monopoly and the import and export of wheat and flouron private account will have to be prohibited.   Willcompensation be paid to the private traders who are put out of
                                                  -     177business.   Can an Import Board stop short  with wheat.  Willit not be compelled to take control of all  cereals.What will be the effect on Imperial relations?          Is there not great danger of friction in having  to bargain each year with Dominion interests as  to the price  tobe paid for their produce.   If they ask excessive prices should we ever be able to refuse to buy and to seekalternative supplies from foreign countries.   Should  we beable to hold them to their contracts in cases of  cropfailure or if world prices rose above contract prices.  Whatremedy should we have for breaches of contract.
