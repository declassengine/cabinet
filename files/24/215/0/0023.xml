LQCUMENT  IS  TEE PROPERTY Off EIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;s S GOVERNMENT) , RET.3S3 (30)COPY NO.CABINSTEE STATUTE OP WESTMINSTER.       Men-crar. dun by the Attorney-General.(Circulated with reference to Cabinet 55(50; .  Conclusion Sib).)      In accordance with the directions of the Cabinet Ihave, in consultation with the legal advisers of the GovernmenDepartments concerned, considered tho question of alternativeredrafts of the Statute of Westminster,      (i) fc.r the purpose of including in the Statute          a statement of the right of the United          Kingdom to admit to Dominion status such          territory as seems proper to her without          obtaining tho consent of the other Dominions..          and     (ii) for the purpose of securing, so far as          possible, that India&apos;s claim to become          a Dominion should not be prejudiced, but          without raising in express terms the other          issue.      (1) In my opinion the first alternative would beeffected by means                    :&apos; an additional, clause to the Statutein terms of the draft  &apos;AT annexed.    I think it rightto say, however, that this draft is open to more than one-serious objection.    In the first place, the expression&quot;to constitute as a Dominion&quot; is an ambiguous one.    Itmay imply merely the grant of self government, which isexclusively a legal matter.        It might, on the other hand,imply the grant c  self government coupled with theright to be recognised by the existing Dominions as -
 co-equal and the enjoyment of all the rights and privileges possessed by them.    This, however, is a political and not a legal matter, nor is it possible to argue that the United Kingdom Parliament, by a grant of self government, can compel the existing Dominions without their consent, to accord suoh recognition with the assumption of obligations towards the new member which that recognition necessarily implies, yet, if for the purpose of avoiding this ambiguity any other phrase is used the whole&quot; purpose of the additional clause so far as India is concerned would be defeated.      I draw attention also to a further objection.The proposed clause,  while assorting&quot; the power of the Parliament  of the United Kingdom to constitute as a Dominion any territory vhich does not form part of a Dominion at the commencement of this Act,  necessarily implies a denial of the right of the Parliament of theUnited Kingdom to constitute as a Dominion any territory which does     form a part of an existing Dominion.    This would no doubt be necessary for the purpose of securing the agreement of the existing Dominions to the clause, but it  seems to me undesirable to open up at this juncture the  question by what authority a Province or other part of an existingDominion can itself be constituted a Self-Governing Dominion.     The Cabinet are aware that circumstances might conceivably arise in the future in which this question would be something more than an academic one,      (2)  The second alternative can,  I think, be best effected by certain amendments,  mainly in the recitals, to the Statute of-Westminster, which are shown in the draft MS&apos; annexed, without any additional clause. In my opinion indeed, these amendments  are in any                       -2-
3 event an  improvement  on the existing  draft, and might woll be adepted even  if the first&quot; alternative  (i.e. the additional clause) is  accepted.      I feel; however, that the amendments which I have suggested although they gc s, long way towards meeting what I understand  to be the Indian objection, yet require to be supplemented by something further.   I have pointed out above that the question of Dominion status and ths recognition by existing Dominions of a new member of that status  is a political rather than a legal one;    and in these  circumstances it seems&apos; to me that the proper way of dealing with it is to secure the assent of the Dominions, at the Imperial Conference to a resolution which I have ventured to. embody in the form of a draft resolution in draft &apos;C&apos;.    If a resolution on these lines were adopted by the Conference, the substance cf the Indian objection would be, as it seems to me, met and a political method would be usedto solve a political difficulty, although,  of course,                                  ft it is for the Secretary of State     forecast thelivelihood of Indian acquiescence rather than myself.
