Copy  No.  55COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the 250th Meeting, held on September 29, 1930.          ******    (12.) THE ENROLMENT  OF PERSONNEL  FOR  ANTI-AIRCRAFT                          EMERGENCY SERVICES.                    (C.I.D. Papers Nos.  178-A and 179-A.)      (Previous Reference :  C.I.D. Minutes of the  245th Meeting, Minute 7.)     THE COMMITTEE had under  consideration  a  Report by the  Air Raids- Precautions (Policy)  Committtee recommending  that the War  Office should be responsible for the enrolment, under military discipline, of a body of men to be held in readiness to  supplement  the  civilian personnel  available for  anti-aircraft emergency services at  the outbreak of war (C.I.D. Paper No. 178-A);  and also a note of dissent to this proposal by the War Office (C.I.D. Paper No. 179-A).     MR.  CLYNES  said that the point which  was submitted to the  Committee of Imperial  Defence for consideration was  whether the  War  Office  or some  other Government Department should  be  responsible for the  provision  of  personnel for anti-aircraft  emergency services,   and that  the  Committee, after  the  fullest consideration, had suggested that the War  Office was the most suitable Department.     MR.  SHAW  said that  the  War Office had raised  strong objections  to this proposal.   They felt  that,  since the organisation proposed  was  essentially  of  a civilian nature,  it should be the responsibility of the Home Office.  The War Office enlisted men for specific purposes, and they considered that this organisation was quite outside the scope of their responsibilities.     THE PRTME MINISTER said that the important point to him was that the War Office took up a rigid stand.  It seemed to him that the essence of the  success of the organisation proposed was that it must be controlled by strict discipline.    MR.  SHAW  suggested  that a  suitable means would be the enrolment  of a voluntary police force.    SIR JOHN ANDERSON said  he  felt that  there  was some misapprehension regarding the proposals  under consideration which he  would like to  attempt to correct. He would point out, in the first place,  that the proposals under considera- tion related  primarily to London.   It was   quite  evident,  from  the mass of information which his Committee had  accumulated, that the maintenance  of the economic life of that city was of the very first importance. The work for which the personnel Avere required was not in any degree comparable to police work.  It would consist of  carrying out repairs to  roads which might be damaged during air raids, the decontamination  of streets affected by gas and such-like things.  He would liketo emphasise that, from  the outset,  the Air Raids Precautionary Sub-Committeehad sought  at  every point  to avoid the  placing of  additional burdens  on theWar  Office.  In  the conditions  visualised,  for example,  it would  have - been      [21769-4]
quite easy and even natural to have  lecommended the immediate establishmentof  martial  law,  since  London  would,  in  effect,  be  in  very much  the same position  as  occupied  territory.   The only  difference being  that,  instead  ofthe  land  being occupied, the  air according to&apos; the  picture  painted  for themby the Air Ministry would be very fully occupied; and,  under these conditions,he  felt sure  the  Committee would appreciate that it would  be an  extremelydifficult  task to  persuade  civilians  to get  on  with  the  work.  It  would  bevery dangerous  to assume that it would be possible to rely implicitly on civilianlabour to carry out  the work under the same conditions, practically  speaking, as might be expected  of soldiers  in the front line of a battle.  It was,  therefore, essentialto have as a stand-by disciplined  forces which  could  be  called  in if  conditionsbecame such that it was impossible for the civilian organisation to carry on.  If thiswas not done, he had little doubt that  such  a  state of panic would be  produced as might  bring about the collapse, certainly of the community in London,  if-not of thewhole country.  Such a safeguard as he had suggested was, he thought, as much inthe interests  of  the Fighting Services themselves as in the  interests of the civiliancommunity.   Further,  he felt that,  supposing it was necessary  to utilise  such  adisciplined force, the moral effect would be such as to attract the  civilian to come inits wake.  The effect of the complete stoppage of the commercial and economic  life of London would be  so disastrous that we could not afford to take any risks at all.He would emphasise that it  was the last aim of his  Committee to put unnecessarytasks on to the War Office.   He was quite convinced that the method suggested wasthe only practicable one.   The numbers required would  be quite  low from  four to five thousand.  The point of  view of the War Office was fully appreciated, and therehad been a friendly disagreement over this matter.     MR.  SHAW said  that, as regards  the necessity for the provision of  a body ofmen, there was no disagreement.   The War  Office  merely stated  that  they were unwilling to carry  out civilian work, which they considered could be done much betterby the Home  Office.     SIR JOHN ANDERSON said that it was quite true that the Home Office could undertake the measure proposed, but in that case it would be necessary to present aspecial Bill to Parliament with a view to acquiring for the  Home Office power to enlist a force under military discipline.  It was  essential to have the  somewhatdrastic powers of a system of military discipline if the force was to wbrk at all.  . Inaddition  to this specific statute giving a  civilian Department  power to raise  amilitary  force,  it would be necessary  to have  an  annual appropriation  for itsmaintenance.  He  felt very  strongly that it was only  the fact  of being under  a code of military discipline, together  with the prestige inseparable from membership of a military force,  which would give  the  necessary security against  a  disastrousbreakdown.     THE PRIME MINISTER enquired how it would be  possible, at the presenttime, to enrol and train a body of men  as described by Sir John Anderson.     SIR  JOHN  ANDERSON pointed  out that  they did  not require militarytraining.  What actually was needed was a disciplined body of unskilled men.  Hesaid that the actual  technical details would be left to the War Office,  but all thatwould  be wanted would be two or three battalions  to be available.  Iri  answer to afurther question from the Prime Minister, Sir John Anderson agreed that these men would  be soldiers.     MR.  SHAW said he would like to ask why the proposal  was confined to London.He suggested that not only London  but every town in the  United Kingdom mightbe subjected  to air.raids, and that,  if  the Army were expected  to  provide a force for all these  places,  they would have nothing left at all for the  legitimate purpose for which the Army was maintained.     SIR JOHN ANDERSON observed that his Committee had definitely confinedtheir plans  to London because other places were not  of  such  great  importanceLondon was vital  to the nation, and if  put out of action for even two or three dayssuch a state  of chaos would be caused in the country&apos;s nerve centre as  might proveirremediable.  There could be no comparison between London and other centres.
    SIR  GEORGE MILNE said he  understood  that Sir John Anderson wassuggesting that Territorials should be employed for this work, and that they wouldbe called  out during  the  precautionary period.   He  woul,d point  out  that the,Territorial Army, as the law stood at present, could only be.called.out on mobilisa-tioni  It would therefore be necessary to alter the existing  statute.    SIR JOHN  ANDERSON said that he did not consider  this a very  serious matter, since the  problem of air attack had undoubtedly altered the entire position.    MR. SHAW  suggested that the Home Office could raise such a  force withoutthe necessity of passing  a  Bill through the House  of Commons,  whereas the  WarOffice could not.    SIR JOHN ANDERSON said that the Air Raids Precautions schemes certainlycontemplated having people trained, but did not contemplate that they should be held under military discipline.  The plans which were being matured for  the collectionof workers were perfectly sound so far as they went, but  by themselves they  were insufficient and must be backed by a small disciplined force.    LORD PASSFIELD suggested that it might be possible to  make an additionto the London Fire Brigades if the London County Council could be persuaded toagree.   The Fire Brigades would  obviously be in  considerable  demand and might prove a via media.    SIR JOHN ANDERSON said that it was estimated that five to six thousanddisciplined men would be required,  and that, in addition, their schemes contemplated the employment of a further twenty to thirty thousand men, who would not be undermilitary discipline. It was essential to provide men under military discipline whohad the prestige of being soldiers to support them.   In  reply to  a question from thePrime Minister, he said that it w7as the intention of his Committee to arrange forthe instruction of local engineers, foremen, &amp;c, in the  duties for which they wouldbe required.    MR. HENDERSON suggested that a very big principle was  raised in the papersbefore the Committee, and  said that he felt it had reached  the stage where only theCabinet was in a  position to deal satisfactorily with the matter.    THE  PRIME MINISTER entirely agreed, and proposed that the papers andthe notes of the discussion  be forwarded to the Cabinet.                                 CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed (a)  To take note of the Report by the Air Raids Precautions (Policy) Committee      dealing with the Enrolment of Personnel for Anti-Aircraft Emergency      Services (C.I.D. Paper No. 178-A),  and also the note by the Secretary      of State for War on the same subject (C.I.D. Paper No. 179-A).(b)  To recommend that  these papers, together with the notes of the discussion      thereon, should be forwarded to the Cabinet for further consideration.     ******2.

Report by the Air Raids Precautions (Policy) Committee covering Report of            Air Raids Precautions  (Organisation) Sub-Committee.    1.   WE have carefully considered the proposals submitted to us in the annexedReport  by the  Air Raids  Precautions (Organisation)  Sub-Committee for theenrolment under military discipline of a body of men to be held in readiness to-supplement the civilian personnel available for aircraft emergency services at theoutbreak of war.    We fully understand the reluctance of the War Office to assume responsibilityfor the organisation of a Force for the performance of duty:- which, as they pointout, is not strictly military in character.  At the  same  time, for the reasons set outin the Report, we see no alternative,  if the country is  not to be found  unpreparedat a time when lack of adequate preparation  might  well  mean immediate  andirretrievable disaster.    We accordingly feel bound to recommend the adoption of the  proposals putforward by the Sub-Committee.                                    Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,                                                          J. R.  CLYNES.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,       July 31,  1930.[2L521]   [21815]
ANNEXURE.[Paper No. A.R.P. (P.) 6.]      THE  ENROLMENT  OF PERSONNEL  FOR  ANTI-AIRCRAFT                         EMERGENCY  SERVICES.       Report of the Air Raids Precautions (Organisation) Sub-Committee.     1.   THE Air Raids Precautions (Organisation) Sub-Committee has had under consideration for some  time  the question of  the most  suitable machinery for recruiting, organising and controlling  the body  of  unskilled or  semi-skilled labour that will be required immediately on the outbreak of war  in connection with the Anti-Aircraft emergency services.     2.   These  services,  which include  ,the arrangements for dealing  with civilian casualties^ the maintenance of communications and the decontamination of streets and buildings in the event of gas attack, are of  vital importance,  and on  their efficient  performance from  the  outset will depend in  very  large  measure the maintenance of  the morale of the civil population,  which  itself  is a first condition of the success of any military counter-measures.   The Sub-Committee have taken the view that, if adequate preparations are made in advance, sufficient civilian labour should be available  in the ordinary course,  but  the risk of a breakdown must be provided against.  This risk will be greatest, and likely also to have the most serious consequences,  at  the beginning   of  hostilities, and in  the  judgment  of  the Sub-Committee  it will be essential to have available a  body of men estimated roughly  at 5,000 to 6,000 enrolled under military law and held in reserve to meet any temporary deficiency of civilian labour.  The Sub-Committee have proposed to the Army Council that the Council should undertake to provide such a body of men. The Army Council,  while not apparently dissenting from the main conclusion of the Sub-Committee, regard the provision of men for duties which are not strictly of amilitary  character, and  the responsibility for which, moreover, will rest &quot;upon a civilian organisation, as falling outside their proper functions.   It is the difference of opinion which has thus arisen that necessitates reference at this stage to the air raids Precautions (Policy) Sub-Committee.    3.    The arguments on which the Sub-Committee rely  in support of their viewmay be summarised as follows :     (a.)  No civilian organisation exists in peace time on to which an organisation           of military type could conveniently be  grafted;  the basis of discipline in           such  civilian  organisations as the Police is quite different  from that of           military discipline, and the sanctions by which it is  enforced would be           inadequate, except in the case of highly trained men of  long service, under           the conditions now in contemplation.    (b.)  A civilian organisation,  on quasi-military lines, could no doubt be set up           ad hoc, but it could only be effective when required is., immediately war           breaks out if it were formed  in  peace time.  Legislation would be           needed applying the provisions of the Army Act, mutatis mutandis, to           the new organisation,  and money would have to be voted by Parliament           annually  for the purpose.    (c.)  If the responsibility were  left upon  the shoulders  of the Civil Authorities,           action A\ ould  have to be  postponed until an emergency had arisen or was           imminent.   The   Civil  Authorities   would  then   come  into  direct           competition with the War Office at  the very moment  when co-operation           and unimpaired effort were essential.    (d.)  Experienced officers  from the fighting services  would  in  any event be           required for setting up the organisation and for its administration;  and,           having regard  to the crucial  importance of the Avork to  be done, the           Government of the clay would unquestionably insist upon the assignment           of officers of high standing and undoubted capacity, whose services would           thus he lost to the War Office.   .&apos;
    (e.) The use of War Office machinery to provide the organisation required would           involve a minimum of expense and a minimum of publicity, and could be           fully justified in view of the vital importance to the conduct of the war of           the services in question.    4.  Our proposals  were put  to  the  Army Council in  the  following concreteform :          &quot; Territorials  to  the  number of 5,000-6,000 to be required  to give  an    undertaking to  come  up for service during the Precautionary Period.  These    territorials to be employed as a temporary measure to provide a mobile  reserve    for carrying out anti-aircraft protection  services  wherever required, and to be    returned as soon as the War Office was able to arrange special units, organised    on the lines of the Transport Workers Battalions in the last war, to take their    place. &quot;*    We now summarise the objections of the Army Council as stated to us :     (a.) The organisation proposed is a purely civil one, and as such should be           controlled and run by the Civil Authorities.    (b.) The primary duty of a fighting service is to defeat the enemy on the field of           battle, and not to organise the protection of the civil population behind           the lines.    (c.) The military authorities will  have  such heavy responsibilities  at  the           outbreak of war as will preclude their shouldering any additional burdens           in connection with the passive protection of the civil population.    (d.) The primary duty of the Territorial Army, on mobilisation, is to  train for           war; and in view of the very limited opportunities for collective training           which are available in peace time, any interference with their programme           would result in serious loss of fighting  efficiency.    5.  Although we made a concrete proposal to the War Office, we have no decidedview as to how our  object could best be  carried out if the  Army Council were toundertake the responsibility suggested. As the next step clearly should be to settle the difference of principle that has arisen, we submit the point at issue to the PolicySub-Committee for their consideration.                                   Signed on behalf  of the Committee,                                             JOHN ANDERSON (Chairman).    E. J.

NOTE BY  THE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR WAR.                        (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 178-A.)     1. I have read the Report of  the Air Raids Precautions (Policy) Sub-Committee onthe above subject (C.I.D. Paper No. 178-A) with some misgiving.  As I had not theopportunity of attending  the meeting of the Policy Sub-Committee when the matter wasunder discussion, I desire to lay the views  of the Army Council before my colleagues onthe Committee of Imperial Defence.     2. The proposal  put  forwai*d  by  the Air Raids  Precautions  (Organization) Sub-Committee and later endorsed by  the  Policy  Sub-Committee, and  the  Army Councilsobjections thereto are  to be found in  paragraph  4 of the Annexure to C.I.D.  PaperNo.  178-A.     3. For convenience I repeat them here ; the paragraph reads as follows :      &quot; Our proposals were put to the Army Council in the following concrete form :          &apos; Territorials to  the number of 5,000-6,000 to be required to  give  an under-     taking to come up for service during the precautionary period.  These territorials to     be employed as a temporary measure  to provide a  mobile  reserve for  carrying out     anti-aircraft protection services wherever required, and to be returned as soon as the     War  Office was able to arrange special units, organized on the lines of the Transport     Workers  Battalions in the last war to take their place.&apos;     We now summarize  the objections of the Army Council as stated to us  :      (a)  The organization proposed is a purely civil one, and  as such should be controlled           and run by the civil authorities.     (b)  The primary duty of a fighting service is  to defeat the  enemy on the field of           battle, and not to organize the protection of the civil population behind           the lines.     (c) The military authorities will have such heavy responsibilities at the outbreak of           war as will preclude their shouldering any additional  burdens in connection           with the passive protection of the civil population.     (d) The primary  duty of the Territorial Army, on mobilization, is to train for war  ;           and in view of the very limited  opportunities for collective training which           are  available  in  peace  time, any  interference  with their programme would           result in serious loss of  fighting efficiency.&quot;     4. Of the above objections, I should like to emphasize  the first. The duties  whichthis  labour organization  would be  called  upon to  perform  can  in no  sense  be calledmilitary-     During the Great  War,  owing to lack  of planning. ahead,  the  War Office were driven by the acuteness of a pressing emergency,  to  undertake  tasks which  should properly have fallen  elsewhere, thus imposing additional  burdens on an already sorelytaxed staff.  The Army  Council  are unable,  therefore,  to  regard the  formation of theTransport Workers Battalions  in  the  Great  War  as a precedent in this case where theCivil Departments may be expected  to have years in  which to  lay their plans to meet thecivil emergency envisaged.
