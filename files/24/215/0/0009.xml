C A B I H E T.COMMITTEE ON POLICY IN PALE33TIMB.SJCC^D R.iEPOR0).1.At their Meeting on September 19th 1930, (Cabinet54  (30) Conclusion  2) tho  Cabinet had.  before  them  our  Report(Papor CP. 301  (.3C)\) in which we recoumiandod tho  Cabinetto  approve tho draft statement of tho  Policy  of His MajostyrsGovernment in Palestine and  to authorise  its  publicationsimultaneously with the publication of Sir J.  Hopa SimpsonfsBepcrt on his Inquiry into Land Settlement Development  andIiiituigratlon in Palestine.    2,     On this occasion the Cabinet after  some  discussionof the financial aspects of  the land settlement schemedecided to postpone further  consideration of  the question until we bad had an opportunity of considering theReport of the Expert Committee to which the settlementscheme had been referred for examination.   3.     We attach (Appendix) the Report ox  the expert committee.   As will be seen (paragraph G) the expert committee assumed for the purpose of their inquiry&quot;(a) that in acoordar.ee with the proposals in  the  draft statement of Polidy it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to provide additional holdings for  both arab and Jews in equitable proportions and  (b) that prioritymust be given to the claims  of Arab cultivators who havebeen rendered 1-a.ndless.&apos;   4.     On these assumptions the estimated  cost ofvarious alternative schemes  are given  in paragraph 13.These range from a scheme to settle 10,000 Arab and 2,000                          -1-
193 Jewish  families at a cost of  3,168,000 to a scheme to sottlo  10,000 Arab and 20,000 Jewish families at a cost of  7,920,000 .   These estimates take no account of expenditure on the miscellaneous projects mentioned in paragraph 10 of the Report or of the expenditure of many millions of pounds which will f-ill on Jewish funds in respect of further settlement if the present high standard of Jewish settlement is maintained.   5.     Having regard to the magnitude of these figures and to  the seriousness of the future position due to rapid iocroasa of population, the Export Committee drew attention in toe concluding paragraph of their Report to the  possibility that the time nad nov, come, when, in the  interests of the present Jev, and Arab population and thoir descendants, it should be declared that the settlement of Jews on the land for the purpose of the Jewish National Home mast be regarded as completed and that it was questionable whether &quot;an expenditure cf the order of upwards of  10,000,000 largely at the charge of the British Taxpayer,  in order to enable Palestine tomaintain an artificial flow of immigration is justified either  by the terms of the Mauaite or on. economic grounds or v. 1th, reference to the needs of^btbor parts of t be aaupire - &quot;   6.     we feel that it would be politically impracticable to make a declaration of the nature indicated in the preceding   paragraph at the present time;  wo also feel that in present circumstances a proposal to spend many millions on luhu settlement of Jev-s and Arabs in Palestine %ould meet with serious opposition in Parliament and the country.   On the other hand we are satisfied that some solution must be found of the problem of the Arabs who have been dispossessed of their land.
                  7.     After careful consideration of tho terms of the              Balfour Declaration and of tho Mandatet we have reached the              conclusion that Groat Britain is morally, if not legally,              hound to see that provision is made for those Arab families              which have been dispossessed of their land as a result of              the manner in which the policy embodied in those documents              has hitherto been applied.   Vie are also agreed that Great              Britain is under no obligation whatever to provide financial              assistance for the establishment of the Jewish National Home.DEVELOPMENT      8.     Up to the present tho various Jewish organisations and SETTLE-MBNT OP       have acquired in all about 300,000 acres of land of which1 RESERVED IMP1        they have settled about 175,000 acres, leaving a reserve of              about 125,000 acres for future settlement.   Prior to the              Jewish settlement of tho 175,000 acres that land was tenanted              by Arabs who were dispossessed of their holdings to make              room for the Jewish settlers.   It is estimated that those              dispossessed Arab families number about 10,000.                 9.     Tho resorved lands in Jewish possession are at              present held by some 10,000 Arab families on the precarious              tenure of tenancy at will.   These Jewish land reserves              would, it is estimated, if properly developed, suffice to              settle at least 5,000 Jewish families in addition to the              10,000 Arab families now in occupation of them.   At the              present rate of Jewish settlement this reserved land is              sufficient  to meet  all Jewish requirements over the next              five years.                       We recommend that the  Jewish organisations should              be permitted to proceed at their own  expense  with the              development  and settlement of this reserved land.   The              passage&quot; of  legislation by  tho Government of Palestine to              confer &quot;occupancy rights&apos;  on  agricultural tenants will safe-              guard the position  as  re-gar as the  future of the Arab              occupants of the  reserved  land-    We  understand that  if              such legislation  is  passed,  and  we urge  that  steps  should              be taken to  seoure  its enactment  with  the  least possible              delay,  the  Jewish  authorities  will arrange  to
                                                               -     195          make adequate  provision  for  these Arab  tenants within          the reserved land.  It will  be  noted  that  our proposals          regarding the  future  development and  settlement  of the          reserved land  involve no charge on public  funds  except such          administrative expenditure as will be necessary  v,o establish          and maintain &apos;occupancy  rights&apos;.  In  our view the various          Jewish organisations  should carry out the  arrangements at  their          own expense  precisely in the same way that they  have  done          hitherto in  the  case  of  their  &apos;settled  land&apos;.ISPOSS-   10.       There remain the 10,000 Arab families dispossessed- ARABS.          as a result  of the  transfer  of  their  holdings to the  Jewish          settlers.  &quot;We  recommend  that  these families be  resettled on          the general  lines contemplated  in Sin J. Hope Simpson1-s          Report over  a  period  of  10 years at a gross cost of (say)           250 a family  or  2,500,000  in  all&quot;*&quot;.    In  order  to forestall          possible Jewish  criticism, any  published statement on the          subject should be to  the effect that  the money  is being          provided for the development  of land, primarily  for the          settlement of  landless Arabs,but that the  settlement  of Jews          is not excluded  from  consideration.   For the purposes indicated          in the preceding paragraph it will be necessary  for His          Majesty&apos;s Government  to  guarantee a loan for such amount as          may be required. Legislation will of course be  necessary  and          as explained in  paragraph 12 of the Experts Report is will not          be possible  to Include  the usual clause providing that the          Treasury shall not  give  their guarantee until they are          satisfied that provision has been duly  made by  the borrowing          Government for the  service of the loan, because  it is quite          certain that Palestine  revenues will  be Inadequate for this          purpose, apart from such -sums  as may  be received from the          settlers by  way  of  rent.          *Note.   The Expert Committee estimated the average cost of              settling 20,000 Arabs at  220 a family, but  pointed out              that the cost per head of settling  a smaller number              would probably  be much heavier.                                    4c.
19611.    We assume that provision will have to he made for interest and sinking fund charges on the loan by means ofan annual loan in aid from British Votes to the palestine government.  It is estimated that this will amount to about 500,000 spread over the first five years.   We note that sir J. Hope Simpson thinks that during the first five yearsof the loan period the amount of rent collected willprobably be small but that ultimately a substantial portionof the capital cost of the scheme should be recovered andthat the Expert Committee feel that any such estimate must,at this stage, be speculative.IS.     It will be seen that the Experts in their Report askwhat will be the position when the funds, the provision ofwhich is now contemplated, are exhausted, and suggest that,unless a pronouncement of eventual change of policy is madenow,  when those funds are exhausted there will be a demand forfurther expenditure on further settlement, if only in order toprovide for the demands of the natural increase in population.Although we do not recommend that any such change of policy should be announced immediately, we think that the warning should be borne in mind, and that, as one means of guardingagainst such a contingency, the Palestine Administration shouldtake immediate steps (a) to provide by means of legislation that during the next 5 years no further parcels of land shallbe acquired by Jewish organizations, in order to give time forthe assimilation of the landless Arabs under the policy whichwe recommend, and (b) to restrict the immigration of Jews tosuch numbers as can be settled on the reserve lands, or canconfidently be expected to be absorbed into industrialoccupation.           If this is not done, we fear that at the end ofthe five years the position will be no better, and possibly even worse, than it is at present.                           5.
r    19713,     If our proposals are adopted no time should be  lost in giving effect to them.;  in particular we hope that notwithstanding the heavy programme of legislation for  next session the necessary Bill will be introduced and if possiblepassed into law before the Xmas Recess,14.     We have requested the Secretary of State for theColonies in consultation with the Chancellor&apos; of the exchequer to revise the draft Statement of Policy to conform with therecommendations of this Report.15.     Our conclusions and recommendations maybe summarisedas follows :-        (i)  His Majesty&apos;s Government are,  in our view,            morally bound to see that provision is made            for those Arab tenants, who have been dis-            possessed of their holdings as a result of            the manner in which the policy of the Balfour            Declaration and the Mandate has hitherto been            applied.  In view of the present state of the            Palestine finances this necessarily involves            the grant of some measure of financial            assistance by the British Government.   No            financial obligation, however, of any kind            rests on the Government in regard to the            settlement of Jews on the land for tho purpose            of the Jewish National Home.       (ii)  The Jewish organisations should be permitted            to proceed, at their own expense, with the            development and settlement of the &apos;reserved            land&apos; acquired by them.  This land will suffice            for Jewish settlement in the next five years.      (iii)  To guard against the contingency of demands for            further expenditure when the funds,  now contem-            plated, are exhausted ,            the Palestine Administration should take            iramediate steps (a) to provide by means of            legislation that during the next 5 years no            further parcels of land shall be acquired by            Jewish organisations, in order to give time            for the assimilation of the landless Arabs            under the policy which we recommend, and            (b) to restrict the immigration of Jews to  such            numbers as can be settled on the reserve lands,            or can confidently be expected to be absorbed            into industrial occupation.      (iv)  The Government of Palestine should as soon  as            possible, confer statutory &apos;occupancy rights&apos;            on agricultural tenants as proposed in the            Hope Simpson Report, and so safeguard the            future position of the Arab occupants of the            &apos;reserved land&apos;.                              6.
   (v)  The dispossessed Arab  families  should be       resettled at a gross cost  of  (say)  3,500,000       in all,  on the lines cent enrol a ted  in the Hope       Simpson  Report.-,   It should be stated in any       public announcement that the money is being       provided for the development  of land,       primarily for the settlement  of landless       Arabs but that the settlement of Jews is  not       excluded from consideration, (vi)   Legislation will be required  and should be       introduced as soon as  possible  authorising       His Majesty&apos;s Government to guarantee a loan       to be raised by the Palestine Government  of       such amount as may be  required  for the purpose       in (iv)  above.(vii)   The provision from British Votes of  such       annual amount as may be required to  meet  the       interest and sinking fund charges on  this  loan       during the first five  years.(viii)  The draft Statement of Policy appended to       CP.501(30) amended in accordance  with the       proposals contained in this Report should be       approved and its publication  authorised       simultaneously with the publication  of Sir       J, Hope  Simpson&apos;s Report.Signed on behalf of the CommitteePHILIP SN0V.D3K.

cAPPENDIX.199,C. (30)5.                                    COPY NO. .     C A 3 H 5 ToCOMMITTED ON POLICY III PALESTINE. Report of Palestine 8ub-Commi 11 e e.  1,   We were appointed &quot;by the Palestine CabinetCommittee with the following terms of reference: -  &quot; To examine Sir John Hope Simpson&apos;s scheme? for thesettlement of 3,000 families at a cost hot exceeding 400j000, and to advise on sources, such as the colonial development Fund, the unexpended balance ,of the existingloan, and the possibility of a new- guaranteed loan forPalestine, from which the necessary financial provisionmight be obtained.&quot;We have held three Meetings?, the Minutes of which are attached? and now report as follows.  2.   At the beginning of our enquiry we found that wewere unable to reconcile the scheme referred to in our termsof reference with the passage relating to agricultural development in paragraph 32 of the draft statement of policy?as approved by the Cabinet Committee.  It is proposed inthe draft statement that agricultural development shouldhave two distinct aims -   (a)&apos;   To improve the method of cultivation of theArab fellah on the unirrigated land? and also to extendirrigation wherever that is possible-, so that the fellahwill be able to gain a reasonable livelihood&apos; from a smallerarea of land than that which has.been considered essentialhitherto.   (b)   So to rearrange holdings of land&apos; that there v/ill   abe/margin for further settlement in accordance with the                                                   terms. *.
                                                       &apos;     200                                                         oterms of Article 6 of- the Mandate.  3.   These proposals follow the conclusions arrived at by Sir John Hope Simpson,,  Gir John., however, did not dealwith the financial aspect in detail * and the Cabinet Coia-committee were doubtless not in tho position fully to appreciate the financial implications of the above-quoted passage in thedraft Statement of policy a  4*   Sir John Hope Simpson contemplated the settlement of3j000 families per annum over a period of 1C years at an estimated annual cost of  400jOOO3 excluding the cost of theland.   Of these families 10,000 would be Arab and .r:o,000     \Jewish.   The cost of the lane, is estimated at  2.5O0jOC0 andthe total cost of the scheme therefore works out at  25500sOOOplus  4;000j0G0 or  6s5:::-0*0C0.  These figri-es give an average cost of settlement per family, including cost of land,of 200,plus approximately 10$ for overhead expenditure.  5.   It is desirable to point out that it is not possible on the statistical information available to give more than avery rough estimate of the cost of settling a family on theland;  but the above figures are supported by the comparableexpenditure on colonisation in Greece .,Jewish organisationsare spending froe&amp;l,200  upwards per family on their settle-ments in Palestine.  6.   For the purpose of our enquiry we have assumed  (a)   that in accordance with the proposals in the draft statement of policy it is the intention of His majesty&apos;s government to provide additional holdings for both Arab and Jews in equitable proportions:                                                      (*)..
 (b)  that  prior it 3-  must  b&amp;.  given  to  the  claims  of Arab cultivators who  have  been rendered landless. The  number  of Arab families  of this class  is estimated by Sir  John Hope Simpson to  be approximately i0,000.     7.  If  these two  assumptions are  accepted  by His Majesty&apos;s Government  it at once  becomes clear  that an expenditure of   400,000 or  even of   1,000,000 is inadequate.    Even if  it were possible,which  it is net to adopt a  pro rata ratio for  the settlement cf a smaller number of  families,    the former sum would provide for  less than ii,000 families, and the  latter for less than 5,000  families,all of whom,  in view of assumption (b), must be Arab A     S.  The  question the arises  what  is  the minimum number of Jewish families fv-r  whom holdings should, be provided in  order  to satisfy the obligation laid down in Article  6 of the Mandate, namely, to  facilitate the  close settlement of Jews upon the land?   This is a question  of policy which i p  outside our terms of reference.  9.   In the circumstances we can only  submit  the following rough estimates of the cost of settling various numbers of  families on the land.      (i)  The existing proportion of Jewish to  arab population  (urban and agricultural)  is approximately 1 to 5.   If It  were decided to ignore the  fact that the great  majority of the  Jewish population is  urban,and to accept the  proportion of 1;5  as a basis  for thepresent purpose,  2,000 Jewish families and  ICvOOOArab families/13
 could be settled at  a total cost of approximately   ,640,000.     (2)  It is not to be  expected that  Jewish opinion  would accept, this  as a fair fulfilment  of the  expectations held out  by the Statement  of Policy. It is understood that even the moderate  section of the  Jews hope that provision will be made lor the settlement of 20,000 Jewish familica over and above the  number which can be  absorbed en the  Jewish  land reserved,  estimated  at not  less  than 5,000  families. As stated above  the  settlement  of 20,000 Jewish families and  the  10,000  Arab families will  cost approximately  6,500,000.     (3)  It might  he  suggested that  a fair settlement would be exact equality  between  the  races,  i.e.  10,000 Jewish families  and  10,000  AraD  families.  The  cost of this  would be  4,400,000.     (i)   These figures however,  assume that the  proposed new settlement should be in addition to  the 5,000 families who  can be  aosorbed,  at  the expense  of J wish funds, on  the Jewish reserved land.   If it is  considered feasible to take this number  into account in determining what number  of  new families  shall be settled  at the cost  of the  Palestine Administration the cost  of the scheme in suL-paragraph  (2)  above will be reduced to  5,400,000 and. that in sub--paragraph (3)to  3,300,000.l ote.  The cost to Jewish funds of settling 5,000- .families on the reserve land would, a obear to  be  not&apos;leas than  6  million.Further^since the average expenditure proposedto be incurred by the Government, on the settlement
of other Jewish families la only      per family it wouldappear that Jewish faros must provide a further  1,000 perfamily in order to maintain their present high standard of settlement.     10.   Tho above figures represent in each ease thecapital cost of settlement including purchase of land andthe overhead charges of administration.   It is hoped thatthe settler will be able to pay an inclusive rent sufficientto provide interest at bf0 and sinking  fund &apos;charge s&apos;for &apos;t-herepayment of the loan In say 15 years, (As in the Greek scheme.)But such payment cannot be oxpeotod to commence immediately * and it is clear that P! destine funds will not bo solo to pro-vide the money required for interest and sinking fund chargesduring the interval before rent payments begin to be received.Talcing this period as 5 years it is estimete^ that an additional sum of approximately h0% of the capital must be provided on this account.   The above calculations include provision, for major development schemes such as irrigation projects, but net forminor services such as might fall within the scope of the colonial development Pund if money were available, noi for other recommendations  -                                                  proorfssivetions in Sir John Hope Slnpson&apos; a report such as a:/ increase inthe agricultural badgetj and remission of taxation.   Furthermore,no account is taken of the recommend at ions of Mr. Strickland which involve additional expenditure which he estimates at about  1 mill!on the Assistance of tho fellah by certain co-operative schemes.It is not desirable to dissipate the resources of the ColonialPevolop?nant Pund by making- large advances of a capital nature butfor 10 years, an unspecified amount for-b-
money could &quot;DO found from that Fund for the payment ofinterest on a loan raised under a guarantee.   But  theextent of assistance from this source is clearly governed by the statutory limit of the income of tho fund and thedemands on it from other sources,   Clearly the sharethat can equitably be devoted to Palestine can only be a relatively small one.      11.  In submitting these alternatives wo desire tocraw attention to two points:(l) that the percentage cost of administration rises    rapidly in proportion as the capital expenditure    is diminished. &quot;&quot;The optimum  of lOfo is based on    the expenditure of the full sum of  6,500/300    over a period not exceeding 10 years.(2) Sir John Hope Simpson&apos;s report shows that the    land available for existing.Arab settlers averages    only 90 dunams as against 130 dun^ms, the estimated    minimum required to give an economic holding under    present conditions,   Hesvy expenditure on develop-    ment and other S3rvices is required to reduce this    minimum to 90 dunams,   Jiull provision for such    development ete* is included in the estimate of     220 of the average cost of settling a family,  but    only on the assumption that a scheme of the order    envisaged by Sir John Hope Simpson is adopted.   A    smaller scheme would consequently involve much  heavier    expenditure on this particular form of development,
!  a                                                                  205                    and  so reduce the amount available for the                    settlement ef Jewish families,               12.    It  is clear that sums of the magnitude, indicated               in paragraph (9) can only be provided by means of loan.               and  that  Palestine would be unable to raise a loan cm her               cvn.  credit.   There seams to be no alternative to His               Majesty&apos;a Government guaranteeing a loan of such amount               as may be decided to be necessary.

Other provision must therefore be made for the               interest and. sinking fund charges on the loan.  This  can               be done either : -                    (a)  by adding  the estimated amount required for  the               first 5 years to the amount of the lean (a course which               we do not recommend) ur                    (b)  by an annual laan-in-aid from British Votes  to               the  Palestine Government,                    If.

Sir John H^pa-               Simpson estimates that from 80% to 90$ of the capital               cost of the. Schema will ultimately be recovered; but               any such estimate must obviously be speculative at this               stage,

obliged to ask the Cabinet Committee to consider what willbe the position when the funds the prevision of which is now contemplated are exhausted.    If n-&quot;1 pronouncement ci eventualchange of policy is made new, it is clear that when those funds are exhausted there will be a demand for further . age waiter3to provide for further settlement, if only in order  to providefor the demands of the  natural increase in pcpulaticn.   Inthis connection it will be seen from Sir J. Hope Simpson&apos;sreport (p. 18 cf the Proof) that the population increased from757,000 in 1922 to 946,000 in 1930.   It is estimated that,ifthe present natural rate of increase of the population continues,.it will double its numbers in 26 years.   it is clear that withina short time the process of settlement will have to stop,  andthe settlement of J ewe on the land for the purpose of the  JewishNational Home must then be declared to be completed.    Althoughit is not within our terms of reference wn venture to draw attention to the possibility., if due regard bo paid to financialeonsiderati ons as well as to the interest of the existingpopulation. Jew as well as Arabj and their descendants, of decidingthat the above stage has already been reached.  The new fact which emerges plainly free; the Hope Simpson Report is that palestine is already not only full, but overcrowded.   Left to itself, Palestine could not possibly affoid to admit any furtherimmigrants,.  The question inevitably suggests itself whether an expenditure of the  order of upwards of  10,oC0,CCC^largely atthe charge of the British Taxpayer, in order to  -nolle palestine to maintain an artificial flow of immigration is justified either by the terms of the Mandate or on economic grounds or withreference to tho needs of other pouts of the Empire...

A. Meeting of the Palestine  Sub-Committee was heldi n Sir John Campbell&apos;s re on at ITo. 2,  Richmond Terrace,at 5.50 P.m. on the loth of September.                 ?

Williams.           Mr. Mayle (Secretary.)      Sir Basil Blackett referred to  the terms  ofreference to the Committee which were  as follows :-           &quot;To examine Sir John Hope  Simpson&apos;s  scheme      for the settlement of 5,000 families at a cost      nQjt exceeding  400,000, and to advise on      sources, such as the Colonial Development Fund,      the unexpended balance of the existing loan, and      the possibility of a new guaranteed leer  for      Palestine, from which the necessary financial      provision might he obtained.&quot;         Sir John Rope .Simpson, pointed out that therehad apparently been some misunderstanding.   He hadcertainly put forward in a letter to the Secretary ofState some general proposals for the  settlement of families over a given period.   His proposalsjwhichwere by no means in a final and detailed form-involved the settlement of 3,000 families per annum over a period                       (i)
of 10 years at an estimated annual cost of 400,-000 per annum excluding the cost of the land.Of the 30,000 families approximately .10,000 wouldbe Arab.     The total cost of  the scheme including theland would be in the neighbourhood of  6,500,000.      Mr. Wat erfiold referred to the minutes ofthe meeting of the Cabinet Sub-Committee at whichit had been decided to appoint  the present Committee.-It was apparent from those minutes that there had been some misunderstanding ever tho  matter.    The Secretaryof State for the Colonies had suggested that a sum of 1,000,000 might be provided by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment by way of a l0an.   The Chancellor of theExchequer had expressed the opinion that no largegrant-in-aid from votes could, be contemplated, andMr.  Snowden had them suggested the appointment ofthe present Committee with the  above terms of referencewhich limit the expenditure to  400,000.   It seemedto   him that it was cut side the Sub-Committ ee&apos;s termsof reference to discuss any scheme involving an expenditure of  6,500,000.      At the Chairman&apos;s suggestion tho Committeeproceeded to examine the question en the followinghypotheses :-(1)   That a sum ox  400,000 only was available.(2)   That a sum of Id. ,000,000 was available as a       revolving fund, that is to say that the       sum could be allocated for this purpose fir       an indefinite period.
(1)   Sir John Hope 3 traps on and Sir John Oiwnpbellagreed that rhile a sum of this amount couldprofitably be spent on furthering agricultural education, on small irrigation schemes and on similarprojects, it would be sf no assistancewhatever sofar as concerned the problem under consideration, namely,that of facilitating the settlement of Jews on the land.(2)   d reviving fund *f  1,000,000 would possiblyprovide for the settlement af s**me 5.000 families on theland.   But all of these families       would necessarily be Arab families and such a fund T-rould simil&amp;rlv beof na- assistance In providing a soluti.cn of the problemunder consideration.  A capital sum of  1,000,000repayable within a specified period could merely be utilised on small non-oolonisaticn schemes such asthose referred to under (I) above.-     Sir John boos Simpson expressed the viewthat a scheme of much smaller dimensions than that ushichhe had contemplated and which Involved a totalexpenditure of some   6,500,000 would be uneconomic.                                            beThe ceriod of operation &quot;it the scheme should/notless than 7 years, and preferably 10 years, the poringwhich he had originally suggested.   It was, moreover,doubtful whether a less extensive scheme than thatwhich he had contemplated would enable the -PalestineAdministration to settle Jews upon the li-mid t* an extent sufficient to carry cut the duty imposed by article 6 of the Mandate.   There wnc- a further &apos;important and possibly decisive consideration.   TheJews were spending some  260,00-0 per annum on
colonization alone,  end it would be necessary to hoveregard to the amount of that expenditure in fixing thesun to he sport by Government.       Sir Basil Blaokett pointed cut that the draft statement cf future policy whioh wo,s to be considered at tho Cat la at meeting on the following day contemplatedexpenditure on tho larger ooolo involved by Sir JohnHope Simpson&apos;s proposal.   iff, Williams suggested thatit eight perhaps be possible to defer for a period of5 years expenditure on tho settlement of further familieson tho land having regard to the land reserves in Jewishhands, and in. the meantime to carry out minor pro jests3uch as irrigation in the Jordan Valley etc..   The problemof providing money for the main purpose would, hewover,have to be dealt with eventually and, in tho meantime, thesituation may deteriorate.       In connection with tho question of the possibilityof raising a farther loan to provide the funds required, itwas pointed out that the financial position of the palestine government was such that, so far as could be foreseen atpresent, there was no prospect, of providing the necessary funds required annually  for sinking fund and interest charges on such a loan.   On a rough calculation it was estimatedthat within tho next few years tho revenue and expenditure ofthe Palestine Government will balance unless further  oxpendi-ture  in necessary on such Heads as Polios, Agriculture, Sducati.          &quot;                  (iv)
 Land Settlement  etc.,  in watch ease  it  wee  anticipated that there  will  be  a deficit.    it was  estimated that the  surplus balance  at  the end  of  1930 alter allowing  for various commitments will be  in the neighbournocd of  70,0.pp.     It was  generally  agreed that it would be undesirable to attempt to  increase revenue by  moans of additional taxation,  which is already en.  the nigh. side.     The expenditure Budget, on  which the above estimate  is  based,,  was considered  by tho High Commissioner  to  be the minimum required for essential Services.      The conclusions  appeared to be :- (i)  That the  Palestine Government were  not  in  a position to raise the  funds  required for  any scheme of development,  either directly  or by way of a loan without the assistance a,f His  Majesty&apos; s Government (ii) That the Palestine Administration  cannot fully carry out tho duty  imposed bj  Article 6 of  theMandate unless a sum of the  order of  5,000,000 is provide d. (iii) That  a  sum of  400,000 as  suggested m the termsof preference  could  not usefully  be spent  on the settlement  of families on the  land and  would be ofno assistance whatever in providing a solution of themain problem.      In the  circumstances,  it was generally agreed.that the Committee  could not usefully proceed                       (v)
with the consideration, of the matter without further instructions.   Mr. Water.field undertook to consult the Chance 11 or of the Exchequer that evening, end to inform Sir Basil Blackett of the result jf hisdiscussion.    Mr. Williams also undertook to informLord. Passfield of the Committee &apos; s views.    It wusalso felt that no useful purpose would he served at themoment in proceeding to consider in detail the question of the sources from which the moneymight be obtained.    In this connection, however,Sir Basil Blackett pointed out that Palestineeould ret obtain large oapital sums from theColonial Development Fund and that the grants wouldhave to be confined to free grants cf comparativelyinconsiderable sums.    If, however, a loan- were raised on the gunrente-e by His Majesty1 s Government assistancefrom the fund could tame the form of free grantson account of interest.    Sir John Hope  Simpsonintimated that he had had in mind the issue of landbonds for the purpose of finding the funds requiredfor the scheme which he had envisaged.   He pciutea outthat most of the expenditure, say some 80 tr  90p, mightbe expected to be returnable expenditure.
r    215     Sir Mas 11 Blackstt said iba-t oh a study of thewhole question from the papers v. hi oh had been sent to his;-,unless His -Majesty&apos;s Government vrere prepared to find some 3,0CO,CO0, it appeared to him that the logical course forHis Majesty&apos;s Government to take was to inform the Leagueof Nations that, having regard to the situation in regardto agricultural land in Palestine as disclosed by Sir JohnHops Simpson&apos;s report, they were of the opinion that the stage had bean reached whoa the Administration would not be justified in view of its obligation to  ensure theposition of the existing population, in permitting theacquisition or tenancy of further agricultural land inPalestine by persons other than the existing Inhabitantsexcept in the case of the Jewish land reserves, and thatthey accordingly proposed in the interests of theexisting population both Jew  and drab to confine their activities  in this direction to improving  the conditionof the fellaheen and to facilitating the consolidation ofexisting Jewish colonies and settlements of Jewish landreserves.   Sir Basil observed  that Sir John Ewpe Simpson&apos;scheme did not apparently take account cr  provide for thenatural increase in the rural population,   Both Sir JohnCampbell and Sir John&quot; Simpson expressed their agree-meat trith Sir Basil Bla ckettf a views.   Sir J^hn Hope Simpsonpointed out that he had been precluded from expressingthose views in his report in view of his terms of reference.Mr. Williams observed that the adoption of such a course might lead  to great difficulties at Geneva, and might conceivably result in the Mandate being transferred tnanother power.(vli)
