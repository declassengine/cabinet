jngnj^ TS THTD PROPWf OF HIS B?IMNIC FAJl&apos;STY&apos;8 (X)vBliMMT.    240El.314(30)TUXPOET OF WAPSHT.PS &amp; WAT? WlATWRIAL   Memorandum by tho First Lord of the Admiralty.          I desire to associate myself very strongly with theproposal of the Secretary of State for War in O.P.  94 for the abrogation of the Cabinet ruling on the subject of the sale toforeign countries of Government war material.          In tho enclosed Paper prepared by the Admiralty staff will be found instances showing how seriously the existingembargo is operating to the detriment of British trade.  invite attention to the case which is now requiring decision inwhich Tickers Armstrong&apos;s have made enquiry for some high anglegun equipments from the Admiralty for sale to the ChineseNationalist Government.  Our refusal to supply this requirement,which can only bo met from surplus stocks in the possession ofthe Admiralty, will hamper the trading activities of the firmin question, and is liable to he misunderstood by the ChineseGovernment,,   We are assisting them with a Uaval Mission andby the training of naval officers in our Eavy.  This is to direct China&apos;s attention to this country for their futurenaval shipbuilding requirements.          If the present embargo is removed, tho Admiralty canimmediately deal with the Chinese request quotod.          Even if the embargo were maintained I submit thatthe application should be treated as outside the scope ofthe Cabinet1s intention.          The Memorandum enclosed has, by my directions, been extended to cover, the cognate question of the private exporttrade of this country in warships and war material.  At atime when the Admiralty&apos;s orders are at a very low ebb it isespecially important to do everything possible to remove                                                   obstacles..,
-2-241obstacles from the way of this trade, and I hope furtherconsideration will be given by the Cabinet to all possible measures that could be taken towards that end.  From thepoint of view of the employment situation it is a matter  of serious concern.  It is clear that Italy especially is  makingspecial efforts, by long credit apparently with government support to secure every possible order for Foreign warships and material.  It is certain that these will be supplied  by italy or other countries even if we maintain our embargo, andit is obvious that British Firms are being put at a greatdisadvantage.                              A. Y. A.ADFIRALTI, S.W.1.   22nd September, 1930.
Foreign orders for British Warship   Builde r s and  rmamen t Firms .          It is desired to submit for consideration  thefollowing remarks relative to the armament  trade with aview to the improvement of the present position and  theremoval of restrictions which act unfavourably against british shipbuilders ami  armament manufacturers in worldcompetition.     2,   These restrictions are in particular     ( a)  The Cabinet decision of Soth October 1929,  that          surplus Government armament should not be  disposed          of to private firms for re-sale to xoreign          Governments,,     (b)  The fact that               (a)  the oversea  Trade (Credit and insurance)                        Act, 19 2o               (b)  and the Export credit Scheme and  Trade                        Facilities Act.          are expressly confined to purposes other than          the manufacture and export of munitions of war.     3.   it is submitted that,  in the interest ox trade andemployment in Britain, ana the maintenance  ox theefficiency of warship building and munition producing plantarid personnel in this country consideration should now begiven to the removal of-these restrictions  which seriouslyhamper British trade.     4.   It can be shown from past experience that manyorders could be obtained by this country if armament firmswere assists a materially so as to be able to offer long-term credit.          It is an unquestionable fact that political pressure, both open and secret, is constantly being brought to bear by otner countries to secure contracts for their nationals, and that in the absence of similar action on oxer part, this militates against our firms.          Tnere are aoubtless other ways in which, by government assis tan ce and direction, a large share ofthe worldTs vast armament business might be deflectedto British firms.     5.   Appended are  stenements and tablesillustrative of the above remarks -Statement a - Examples of mterational competition                            in armaments trade.Statement B - Cases Illustrating the working of present     &quot;Government  embargo.Table I - Var vessels building for Foreign powers in                            various countries.Table u - prospective and projected building programme                   of various Foreign powers.
                               StatementPXAMPLPS OF P?TPR:NATlOPAL CO iviPETITION IN         ARPAPFPTS TRAP?     The arms producing Powers most interested in the keeninternational competition to supply the demands of the minorpowers are;-      Britain, Italy, France and U. S.A.     Recent and current examples of such competition follow.In China  1     Britain and U.S.  in competition to supply China with alarge cruiser, Negotiations favoured Vickers and. contractwould probably have been secured If Vickers could have acceptedproposed terms of payment.  2.    Anglo-French-American competition to secure orders forwar and commercial aircraft from Nanking and Canton Governments.        This has resulted in America supplying most of theCentral Governments aircraft, munitions and pilot instructors,and an American company securing the Air mail line contractShanghai to Hankow - the beginning of - extensive air development in China.         France has been successful against the British (FarFast Aviation Co.) in supplying aircraft and munitions to Cantonand other Southern factions.  5.    Radio Corporation of America in competition withMarconi has secured the contract to operate Chinese wireless stations now under military supervision.Near Past  4.  In Abyssinia  Italy and France in competition forimportant P/T control contract. This is likely to be givento Italy. This  aspect has an  important military bearing.  5.    Greece  In recent competition for two Greek destroyersbetween. Britain, Italy and France, the contract awarded toItaly,  5.    Persia  Contract  for  construction of 6 gunboats forwhich Great-Britain was up to a certain time a potentialcontractor, was given to  Italy.  ^*    Yugo  Slavia   Contract for  new destroyer  leaderssecured by Yarrow for Britain who  completed hull  and machinery.Vessel will be  armed by French  and fitted with Dutch firecontrol Instruments - all of which could have been supplied by great Britain.         The  torpedoes and tubes for this vessel  were  supplied by- France as Yarrow  could not obtain them from Admiralty inview  of  Government policy.  8.    Roumania Competition  for Important  contractsinvolving acraroToiis  to Roumanian Navy  and naval  base and commercial harbours  project will probably be competed  for  inthe very near future  by&apos;Great Britain,  France, Italy and holland.
     9&apos;    L-outli America.  Brazilian Naval Training ship.Contract in October;&quot;19&quot;^9,  appeared assured to Vickersbut, owing to Italian intervention, the contract wascancelled.          Ecuadorian patrol vessels.  British xirm( Thornycroft) are unable to offer sufficiently longterm payments so that contract will probably be ordered to a German iirm.
           The  foliov,ing  typical  ca&amp;et  may  serve  to illustrate the effect of  our  present  policy  on the  efforts  ox our firms to secure  foreign  orders,     1.    Rerue&amp;t  by yarrowTs  to  Admiralty for quotation fortorpedo tubes  and  torpedoes  xor  Yugo  Slav  piotilla leaderbuilding by that firm.   This was  impocbible,  due  toGovernment policy, and tne order went  to francs.     2.    When the Canton  -Government urgently required, threesurplus aircraft and a number  of machine guns and ammunitionthey attempted to  purchase these  surplus stores  through aBritish aircraft company in  Kong  Kong.   After much delay the transaction was finally  prohibited on  political  grounds.in the interval, negotiations  with the French had securedwhat was required,  by the Cantonese from  Saigon.     3.    The most recent  case,  yet to be  aecided, is theapplication by Messrs. vickers-Arms.trongs  to  pv.rh.case 18anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from Admiralty  for re-sale to^ the Chinese Central  Government - now  in  the throesof civil war.  The order is  relatively small  but  the potentialities are great and competition Is keen.  Thematerial can be made available but a  decision has necessarilybeen delayed for a month due to  stipulations  of government policy. Resultant  future orders  for ammujQition andequipment  are  necessarily  involved in  the  decision.     4.    Tiie Chinese Government have  recently beencontemplating the  immexiate  construction ox two  6&quot; guncruisers,  or a large 8&quot;  gun  ship, a prospective  orderinvolving  considerably over  a   1,000,000..           Messrs.  yiclors  proceeded to conduct complicatednegotiations to secure tuis. contract,  negotiations proceededfavourably.  Draft designs were  provisionally acceptedby tne Chinese, the price  was  arrange 1 and there  seems a everyprospect of the order coming to  Britain.           Difficulties arose and negotiations collapsedon the question of terms ox  payment.,           Meanwhile, tiie Central  Government are  involvedin civil war&apos; and are too preoccupied  to  proceed  further with their programme.           It is anticipated  that the matter will  be taken up egain in tua near future  and  the opportunity  ofsecuring this important  contract  will re our,  depending on financial assistance.
