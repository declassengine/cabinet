There was an unusually large increase of over 79,000in the Live Register on 8th September.   The attaohedmemorandum has been prepared giving details of this increase and will, I think, be of interest to my colleagues.     With reference to the extended and local &quot;holidays&quot;mentioned in the note on the North Western Division, it shouldbe understood that the fact that workers register as unemployeddoes not necessarily mean that they will receive unemployment.benefit.   Sneaking generally, benefit would not be payable ifthe &quot;holidays&quot; were the usual recognised holidays for the firms or districts ooncemed, but the days of holiday couldcount as waiting days and so enable the workers concerned to qualify for benefit in respect of continuous days ofunemployment occurring within ten weeks thereafter;  in manycases, the workers would have already put in their waitingdays owing to short time working and In their cases sigr-ingfor the holidays does not profit them, except as a measureof precaution.   Only so far as the unemployment was an extendedstoppage of mills in addition to the recognised local or&quot;wakes&quot; holiday would benefit be payable for the &quot;extendedholiday&quot; or part of It.iSECRET.0.
