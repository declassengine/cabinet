Copy No.    30                  TO  BE  KEPT  UNDER LOCK  AND  KEY.CP.  349  (30).It is requested that special care may be taken   to ensure the secrecy  of this document.              CABINET.Committee on Alleged Propaganda Activities of the Third  International and the                              Soviet Government.                                  REPORT.          (Submitted in  accordance with Cabinet 28 (30), Conclusion 1.)    1.  WE have been asked by the Cabinet to examine the evidence in the hands ofvarious Government Departments in regard to the alleged propaganda activities ofthe Third International  and the Soviet Government.    2.  This enquiry was rendered necessary by allegations that the Soviet Govern-ment  was guilty of continual breaches of the pledge given in December last &apos;&apos; to refrain and to restrain all persons and organisations under their direct or indirectcontrol, including organisations in  receipt of financial assistance from them, fromany act, overt or covert,  liable in any  way whatsoever to endanger the tranquillityor prosperity of any part of the territory of the British Empire.&quot;    3.  The Cabinet will expect some account of the type of evidence put before us.    4.  There are available few examples of the most definite and positive kind ofdocumentary evidence, i.e., originals, or photographs of originals,  of  documentswritten or signed by Soviet  officials.  This is natural, considering  that  such raredocuments would be kept in particularly safe hands.  One such photographic copy ofa letter signed by a Soviet official was produced, and one of a circular issued  by theComintern for the support of the &quot;revolution &quot; in India.    5.  The Government  Departments concerned have, however,  a considerablenumber of typewritten copies, made by agents, of instructions for propaganda  issuedby the Comintern or an  affiliated body and transmitted  by Soviet officials to their destination.  It might be said that, unless the agent who made the copy is present forcross-examination, the copy itself is of doubtful value.  Confirmation must dependon circumstantial evidence.  If a copy of a letter prescribing certain action fallsinto the hands of a Government Department, and  if subsequently that action iscarried out,  it  is a  fair inference  that  the copy was authentic.  Of this type ofevidence we have been given  a clear example.    (5.  In considering a mass of documentary evidence, not of this first-hand nature,but consisting of reports from those whose duty it is to watch activities hostile  to thiscountry, we have  taken into account the considered opinions of certain highly-placedand responsible  civil servants.   We venture  ta think that such opinions, based on long experience  and a careful estimation of the weight to be attached  to varioussources of information, are admissible as evidence.   Here we found a clear view asto the breach of the pledge, both by the  Third International and by officials  of theSoviet Government.[21861]
    7.  We have also examined the evidence of open propaganda carried on by such bodies as the League Against Imperialism  and  by  such organs  as  the  &quot;daily worker.&quot;  There is a strong presumption, and in one case at least a confirmation,of connexion between them and the Comintern or its affiliated societies.    8.  We are therefore of opinion  that the Soviet  Government has not  fulfilledthe terms of its  obligation.   There is  perhaps in this, nothing surprising, sincepropaganda of this nature is to them a vital part of their proclaimed doctrines and intentions.    We do  not recommend that  the subject  matter revealed by our investigationsshould  now lead  His Majesty&apos;s Government  to consider  the  advisability  of  a diplomatic rupture.    We do, however, think  that a point has been reached  when  a remonstranceshould be  addressed to the Soviet  Government by the Secretary of State for  ForeignAffairs.                                  (Signed)       SANKEY.                                                 CHARLES TREVELYAN.                                                 A.  V. ALEXANDER.2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,      October 20, 1930.
