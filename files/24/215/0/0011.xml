IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS britannic MAJESTY1S GOYEPJJKEHT) .               C A B I K A T.MEMORANDUM OH THE REPORT OP TILE COHFERBHCB OH THE   OTBHATIOH&apos; OF PZIIIIKTOP; L!:CISLATIOII?  T929.   Prepared by the Attorney-General in Pursuance      oP Cabinet 51 (30) Conclusion 1  (b).       I was  directed by the above minute to report to theCabinet as to what portions of the Report of the Conference on theOperation of Dominion Legislation should be implemented at once.       The Imperial Conference, 1926 , laid &quot;down the general principle of equality of status.  Certain of the forms andusages of government which date from the old colonial days and ere still in existence as between Great Britain and theDominions, are inconsistent with this new conception.   Therecommendations of the Conference on the Operation of dominion legislation 1929, are designed to remove these legal anachronisms.       These recommendations fall under three heads:.-1.  Disallowance and Reservation,&apos;The Conference recommended the abolition of thepowers which reside in The King of disallowingDominion legislation on the advice of his UnitedKingdom ministers-  These powers have fallen intodesuetude and need not be retained, save onespecified case arising under the Colonial StockActs.  Similar recommendations were made withregard to reservation.  In my opinion these recommendations should be carried out.The fact that the laws of a Dominion cannot, asin the case of ordinary nations, have effectoutside its territory is inconsistent with itsnew status and results in some inconvenience, e.g*its courts cannot punish a subject for crimesC511(50).oExtra-Territorial Legislation -
. Domini, on Parliaments should haveoowcre:-:tra-territori;:1 effect  to  theirlawsI see no objection to this recommendstion      being&quot; carried out 30  Colonial Loots Validity Act.      This act, pessec&quot; in 1S65, was sit once the source      and limit of colonirl legislative capacitys for      the legislature of i colons&apos; woo authorised to      make laws on any topics save those which were      there  or ehould thereafter he covered, by Imperial      enactments relating to that colony0      Pan;..  Imperial statutes have been passed end mod.., applicable  to the colonies, dealing with matters both important (such as the Crown)  end unimportant (such as the lows  of  evidence, banlcruptcy end coinage).  Accordingly even  tod--y  a  Dominion which is subject in this respect to th same  restriction as the Colonies cannot legislate on even the moot trivial of these topics.      Our representatives at the 1989 Conference didnot seek to resist a change in this position.    To do so would: have been foolish and hopelessly ot variance withthe new  conception of equality of status.      Our  contention was that,  as well with regard, to maintaining the  unity of the Lmpire ao with regard to thepractical utility of preserving a common Pmpire-wide code of law on certain important matters,  certain  topics should still be  treated  as  the  exclusive preserve of  the  imperial parliament,   But this  contention was strongly sttacked byDominion representatives ss being inconsistent with equality of status.      &apos;&apos;Like you,!,  they  seie.s v,we  value  the maintenanceof unit;.&apos; and recognise  the  volue  of a common code;  but  this
unity and this code can bo beat secured not by a limitationof freedom but by the fullest grant of freedom coupled withthe wise use of our legislative powers.&quot;         In view of the 1926 resolutions, we felt ourselvesconstrained to give way to this point of view and accord-ingly concurred with the Dominion representatives in recommending complete legislative freedom;, though we obtainedan undertaking (at present embodied in a recital to thedraft Statute of Vestminstor) that no Doaiinion- would availitself of its legislative powers with regard to the succession to the Throne or the Royal Title save with the consent of theUnited Kingdom and nil the other Dominions.          The report of the 1929 Conference was unanimous,and. it has now been debated and approved in every DominionParliament (save that of Newfoundland)j and 1 feel that,wore we how to Initiate objections to It, wo should createdistrust and suspicion.          If, however, objections were raised from Canada,wo could, 1 presume, take the line that the whole situationmust bo further considered said the opportunity would ariseof restating our original contention.          It would bo In accord, with that contention to getthe objections withdrawn by obtaining an agreement to treat    (a.)   any matters relating to the Throne (and not merely           the succession to the Throne),    (b)   certain matters relating to Defence,    (c)   the law of arise, as being subjects for Imperial legislation only; and tosecure an agreement to postpone any alteration in theMerchant Shipping Law until a common cods has boon settled.          I feel bound, however,  to remind the Cabinet that                             -3-
each of these matters was very fully discussed at the 1929Conference, that certain of the Dominions showed themselves as unalterably, opposed to this solution, and I shouldmyself regard it as improbable that they would be prepared toaccept in 1930 that which they no emphatically rejected in19 29.
