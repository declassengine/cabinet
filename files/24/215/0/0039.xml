   NOTE  OH  P0LI3Y  OF  BUDGETARY  LIMIT AT idg .(Prepared in accordance with the  instructions  and notes left  by  the late  SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR AIR).1.        The Air Ministry are fully in favour of the principleof the limitation of armaments,   They have agreed to theimposition&apos;of restrictions upon Air Armaments by means of :-      (a) limitation of personnel by numbers;      (b) limitation by numbers of first line strength of aircraft;      (c) limitation by numbers of aircraft in reserve.They also support a full measure of budgetary &quot;publicity&quot; .  Theyobject, however, on the following grounds, to a further and indirect form of restriction by means of budgetary limitation.2.        In April 1929 budgetary limitation .was proposed by france at the Sixth Session of the Preparatory Commission.   Itwas strongly opposed by the United States and in the end aresolution was passed by 22 votes to 2 which recognised thatbudgetary limitation did not meet with general assent butfavoured  budgetary publicity.   The two powers in the minoritywere  China and the U .S .S .R .3.        In September 1929, the British representative reopenedthe question but was met with a general objection against anyattempt at going back  cn the previous resolution4 .         If, therefore, the question of budgetary limitation isnow reintroduced by the British representatives on the PreparatoryCommission, we  shall be doing so ir the face of  (a) a recentrejection  of the principle,  (b) a still more recent refusal ofthe Commission  to reopen the question and  (c) reiteratedrefusals  of the United States to accept the  principle of budgetary limitation at  all.    Some  of  the  powers no  doubt have so  far given  their&apos;votes  against budgetary limitation not*&quot; A precis of the opinions expressed at the  two meetings  in  April 1929 and September 1929 is attached  as  an Appendix.
Hi because they individually objected to the principle, but because they believed that its general acceptance would be impossible to secure and might prejudice agreement in regard tQ other methods of limitation.   That that opinion should, be held is a serious warning, against  over-complexity in proposals for limitation and reduction of  armaments.           The  argument advanced in favour of superimposing indirect  (i .e . budgetary)  limitation  on direct  limitation  of material has been that limitation  of  material could,  not be supervised, and would not  command  confidence;   and that budgetary limitation is required as  providing so  to  speak  a reliable  range of the actual accumulation of war material.   The answer to this is  :-     (i)  that owing to differences in  purchasing power,          standard of life, etc., in different countries, there          would be perpetual controversy as to the reliability          of any gauge by expenditure;    (ii)  that any distrust as to good  faith in the observance          of direct limitation of material must equally, if          not to a greater extent, be felt in relation to           (indirect) budgetary limitation.          As an. illustration of the former point, it may be observed that actual expenditure on war material for the british air Force with a first-line strength of approximately 680 air- craft is about the same (giving the franc  a parity value of 124 to the pound)  as the corresponding  expenditure for theFrench Air Service with a first-line strength of approximately 1300 aircraft . 5      &apos;  if jgis 1&apos;ajesty&apos;s Government adopt the standpoint that war material  can only be limited, effectively by budgetary limitation, the result might well be the repudiation by other
10 . .10 . 30 .countries of the principle  of limitation of material byenumeration, which it would then be  impossible  for us  effectively to defend.6.     The Air Ministry are strongly of opinion the-t directlimitation of material by enumeration plus as full a measure  of budgetary publicity as can be attained, represents the only practical line of approach to an actual international  agreement for the reduotion and limitation of air armaments.  They are convinced, that, if an attempt is made to superimpose  indirectbudgetary limitation and thereby to introduce a separate and additional standard of comparison accompanied by numerous and very contentious complications, the only result would  be gravely to prejudice the prospect of international agreement and to hinder the progress of Disarmament.
                APPENDIX to note OF BUDGETARY LIMITATION PROPOSALS,  10.10 .30.1.          When this question was first discussed at the sixth Session, April 1929, the preparatory commission had before it a &quot;French draft which provided for thelimitation of expenditure on upkeep, purchase and manufactureof war material, such limitation to provide separately forland, naval and air armaments.2.          The arguments for this form of limitation as stated by the Prencii Representative (M.Massigll) werein brief:-  That direct limitation was not possible andthat indirect limitation by the budgetary method wag theonly way in which limitation of material could in practice be achieved.  He, however, recognised &quot;the difficulties inthe way of this proposal and the strong opposition to our suggestion in some quarters&quot; .3.          The contrary view was expressed by the UnitedStates of America (Mr. Gibson) who said:  &quot;I am quite prepared to agree to the broadest and most comprehensivemeasures of -oublicity  ......However, after exhaustiveand sometimes exhausting debates on the sxfbject of budgetary limitation my Government still adheres to itsconviction that such limitation would present no truepicture in view of the great variation in the cost oflabour and material, fluctuations in exchange -and various other factors.  &apos;-&apos;re feel that the picture arrived at in thisway could be no true picture and. would leave the dooropen to every sort of evasion, and that such a method inunpractical and ineffective.4.          The German representative pressed for directlimitation of material and considered that limitationeffected by the reduction of budgets would be illusory.5.          The British Empire  (Lord Cushendun) gaveguarded support to budgetary limitation, but thoughtthat there was no general assent at the moment and that                          -4-
it might be necessary to fall back on a system of publicity  .... &quot;\the never you try to find a commondenominator in money or in anything else you are up against these inequalities in the cost of material whichvitiate a  system which has to be regarded as giving adirect comparison between one nation a.nd another.....that there is always liable to be misunderstandings un-less you have elaborate explanations regarding costs in the various countries.           The United States then reiterated that  theycould not hold out any hope of accepting the principleo f bu dge t a.ry 1 imi t at i o n .Conclusion.           The result of the discussion was that  the prench delegation withdrew their proposals for the reason,as they stated, that our main task is to arriveas soon as possible at a draft convention for thelimitation of armaments which may perhaps only representa minimum  but which will at all events be a  draftconvention.  A draft resolution was  substituted  in thefollowing  terms:-     &quot;The  preparatory Commission  in  a Disarmament     Conference have rejected the  system of  direct     limitation on material in service and in  stock,  and     having  noted that  the system  of indirect  limitation.     (limitation of expenditure on material) did not     meet  with general  assent  fle.cls.res that  the  limitation     and. reduction of material must  be sought by means     of publicity of expenditure&quot; .           This resolution was adopted by 22  votes to  2the  only countries voting against being China,  andthe  U.S.S.R.           The  next stage in the discussion of  thisquestion was  at the 3rd. Committee  (Reduction of  Armaments)10th Session of the Assembly  (September 1929)           The British Representative (Lord Cecil)
110.30 .then submitted a new draft Resolution reopening thequestion of -     (a)  the application of the same principles to          the reduction and limitation of personnel and          material,, whether in land,, sea or air forces;     (b)  limitation of the strength of the force          either ty limiting its numbers or its period          of training or both;     (c)  limitation of material either directly by-          enumeration or indirectly by budgetary          limitation, or by both methods.2.          In the discussion which ensued M, Loudon,President of the preparatory Commission drew attentionto the previous discussions and to the terms of theresolution in which they culminated ( see I above.) .  he urged, that the previous resolution could not bediscarded, without re-opening the discussion which was bound to delay consunmation of the work of the preparatoryCommission.  Prance (M,J-rassigli) took the same line andurged, that the discussion should not be re-opened; he couldnot a.ccent Lord Cecil&apos;s new proposals.  The question was whether they could serve the cause better by seeking extremesolutions, trying to go straight to the goal to achieve the&apos;ideal at once or by contenting themselves with what was for the time being possible.  The same view was expressed by italy and Japan.3.          The discussion terminated in the withdrawalof Lord Cecil&apos;s resolution and in the acceptance of analternative draft resolution put forward by K.?olitiswhich was framed in general terms and which urged thenecessity of accomplishing the first step towards red\ictionand limitation in armaments with as little delay as possible.
