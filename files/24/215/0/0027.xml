(C.I.D. Papers Nos. 1009-B and 1008-B.)     (Previous Reference :  C.I.D. Minutes of the 243rd Meeting, Minute 3.)    THE  COMMITTEE  had under  consideration the fifth  annual review  ofImperial Defence  Policy by the Chiefs  of Staff Sub-Committee (G.I.D.  PaperNo. 1009-B), together with the papers prepared for the use of the Chiefs of Staff inconnection with the compilation of the above review (C.I.D. Paper No. 1008-B).    SIR GEORGE  MILNE said that he had  nothing to add  to the review,  butthere were  certain points  to  which he might  with advantage invite particular attention.  In the first place, it was to be  noted from paragraph 1 that the  reviewhad been drawn up with a view to its consideration during the Imperial Conference,if such a course were deemed desirable. The recommendations had been cut downas low  as possible, and  were  only  four in number.   The first was  contained inparagraph  2, in which it was suggested &quot; that  the Imperial Conference should beasked to reaffirm the principles contained  in their previous reports.&quot;  On pages and 7 of the review, it was pointed out that our coast defences were obsolete;  and itwas recommended  (in paragraph 37) that they should be brought up to date, inrespect of light defences and anti-aircraft  defences, as far as funds admitted.  Thethird recommendation had reference to the vital necessity for the full mobility of ourfleet, and urged (see paragraph 39) &quot; that a return should be made to the policy ofthe annual  provision towards the oil fuel reserve, even  if  the full amount requiredby the ten-year  rule cannot be arranged.&quot;  The fourth  recommendation was setforth in paragraph 44; it emphasised that,  from  the strategical point of view, it was most important  that every possible effort  should be made to secure  the  southernalignment for the Iraq-Mediterranean oil pipe-line.   In conclusion, Sir GeorgeMilne drew attention to the two graphs annexed to the review (Appendices III andIV respectively).   The first showed the trend of  the total defence expenditure ofvarious nations from 1923 onwards; and  it was to be noted that in the UnitedKingdom alone had defence expenditure decreased.  The second graph dealt with military expenditure only.    LORD THOMSON invited attention to paragraphs 65 and 70.  As regards thelatter,  it was important to press on with the route down the Arabian littoral of thePersian Gulf owing to the difficulties connected with the route along the Persianlittoral.                                CONCLUSIONS.    THE COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed     (a) To take note of the fifth  Annual Review of Imperial Defence  policy  by  the           Chiefs of Staff  Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No.  1009-B),  and  of the          papers prepared for the  use of the Chiefs of Staff in connection with          the compilation of that Review  (C.I.D. Paper No. 1008-B).       [21769-1]

A Review of Imperial Defence, 1930, by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.                             I. INTRODUCTORY.    1.   IN the preparation of this, our fifth, Annual Review,, we have kept in mind the near approach of the Imperial Conference,  and have included material which, insuch form as may be deemed appropriate, may, wre hope, be useful for any discussion on Imperial Defence on that occasion.  To assist us in our task we have receivedvaluable material from the Foreign Office, Colonial Office, India Office, Home Office,and the Secretariat of the Committee of Imperial Defence, as well as from our  ownStaffs (C.I.D. Paper No. 1008-B).*    2.   It is unnecessary to restate  the main principles governing the problem ofImperial Defence.   These  are set forth  in a  series of resolutions included in theReport of the Imperial  Conference,  1923, which were reaffirmed and expanded inthe Report of  the Imperial Conference,  1926 (Cmd. 2768,  p. 35, reproduced for convenience of reference in Appendix I).  These two sets of resolutions conformgenerally to the statement of general principles adopted by  the  Committee ofImperial Defence on our recommendation, and summarised in  our last two annual reviews (C.I.D. Paper No. 948-B, paragraph 4, reproduced in Appendix II).  We Firstrecommend  that the Imperial Conference should be asked to reaffirm  the principlescontained in their previous reports,  subject to such  alterations of minor detail asmay be necessary to bring them up to date.    3.   The more important changes in  the world situation of the past few years,and especially those which have occurred during the past twelve  months,  have tended more and more  to shift  at  present the  centre of  gravity of the  defence problems of this country towards the East.   These  events may be summarised asfollows :     (a)  The final  settlement  of  the Reparations question in  Europe,  with the          consequent evacuation of the occupied territory of the Rhineland;    (b)  The signature of the Kellogg Pact;    (c)  The Naval Disarmament  Conference of 1930;    (d)  The outbreaks in Palestine;    (e)  The unsettled condition of Egypt;    (/)  The continuance of civil  war in China;    (g)  The recent troubles in India and their repercussions on the North-West          Frontier of that country;    (h)  The upheaval in Afghanistan.[21480]* Printed also as Papers Nos. C.O.S. 234, 235 and 236.B
     4.  The effect of the agreements reached under (a), (b) and (c) of the previous paragraph, coupled with the signature of the Optional Clause, has been to reducethe  risk of military operations on  the continent of Europe in which the UnitedKingdom is liable to become involved.  They appear also at first sight to provide afoundation for  a further step in the reduction and limitation of armaments, onwhich the  Imperial Conference, 1926, laid  so much  stress.   We are, however,constrained to  point out that the  increased  insurance against war  which  these various instruments were designed to afford has not been reflected in any way in themilitary budgets of  certain continental nations, whose tendencies are to spend moreand more money on military preparedness,  as is shown in the  attached  graphs(Appendices  III   and  IV).   Moreover,  the  occurrences   summarised   underitems (d)  to (h)  of the preceding  paragraph indica.te that the preservation of peace in  the countries concerned is more likely to  call for armed  intervention by thiscountry than for the good offices of the League of Nations.     5.  The London Naval  Treaty,  1930, provided it is  ratified by  the  states concerned and that  France and Italy finally  subscribe to Part III of  the Treaty,promises  to extend  considerably the limitation  of armament  achieved by theWashington Treaty  of 1922.  Nevertheless, the &quot; considerable effort &quot;  noted  at thelast Imperial Conference (Resolution 3), as involved in the maintenance of theminimum  standard  of naval strength contemplated in the Washington Treaty,namely, equality with the naval strength of any foreign Power, will still be required.This subject is  discussed in greater  detail under the heading  &quot;Naval Policy&quot;(paragraphs 10 to 17).     6.  The maintenance of law  and order in  Palestine, the protection of the lives and property of British subjects in  China,  and the discharge of the particularresponsibilities of this country in Egypt, are subjects which are discussed at greaterlength in  paragraphs 52, 56 to 61, and 53, respectively.     7.  It is not, perhaps, within our purview to comment on the military liabilities of India, which  the Imperial Conference, 1926  (Resolution 7), described as throwing&quot;upon the Government of.India  responsibilities of a specially onerous  character&quot;;but we feel bound to record the fact that, should the situation on  the North-west frontier deteriorate seriously as  one of the results of the present  anti-Governmentagitation in India, or should the internal situation be aggravated by any disaffectionon the part of the Indian Army, it  might become necessary for the Government ofthat country to call  for considerable military assistance  from the United Kingdom.     In this connection we desire to point out that this commitment is one  whichcan  be investigated  and  prepared  for on the basis  of information and forecastswhich can be provided only by those  fully conversant with the political situationin India and its probable developments.   It is with them that the  initiative in anyfurther enquiry or preparation must rest.     8.  Apart from the above liabilities, the one to which, perhaps,  we shoulddirect the most  attention  is the  necessity for completing with modern  equipmentthe defences of overseas naval bases.  This forms the subject of a special section ofthis  paper (paragraphs  18 to 37).     In view of the emphasis laid in Resolution 4 of the  Imperial Conference, 1926,on &apos;&apos; the vital importance of ensuring the security of the world-wide trade routes,upon which the safety  and welfare of all parts of the Empire depend,&quot; this is  a subject which should be of particular interest to.the Imperial Conference.                              II. COMMITMENTS.     9.  The commitments arising out of  British foreign policy are summarised inthe order of their importance in the Foreign Office Memorandum (C.I.D. PaperNo.  1008-B,* Annexure 1, Section 1),  and so far as Imperial Defence is concernedthey do not alter the situation as laid down in previous years and dealt with in earlier Annual Reviews.   We feel it necessary, however, to draw the  attention ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence to an observation by the Foreign Office in thesection of their Memorandum dealing with the  Locarno Treaties.  This observation,which is  reproduced from earlier Foreign Office reviews prepared  in the sameconnection, is that         &apos;&apos; The more the  nations  of Europe become convinced of our readiness to     fulfil  our guarantee, the less likelihood will there be that we shall be called upon     to do so.&quot;

In view of the emphasis laid in Resolution 4 of the Imperial Conference, 1926,on &apos;&apos; the vital importance of ensuring the security of the world-wide trade  routes,upon which the  safety and  welfare of all. parts of  the Empire depend,&quot;  this is a subject which should be of particular interest to the Imperial Conference.                              II. COMMITMENTS.    9.  The commitments arising out of  British foreign policy are summarised inthe order of their importance in the Foreign Office Memorandum  (C.I.D. PaperNo. 1008-B,* Annexure  1, Section 1),  and so  far as Imperial Defence is concernedthey do not alter the situation as laid down in previous years and  dealt with  in earlier Annual Reviews.  We feel  it necessary, however, to draw the attention  ofthe Committee of  Imperial  Defence to an observation by the Foreign Office in thesection of their Memorandum dealing with the Locarno  Treaties.   This observation,which is  reproduced from  earlier Foreign  Office reviews prepared in the sameconnection, is that          &apos;&apos; The more the nations of Europe  become convinced of our readiness  to     fulfil our guarantee,  the less likelihood will there be that  we shall  be called upon    to do so.&quot;
We think it important that the Committee of Imperial Defence should be under nomisapprehensions that, so far as the Defence forces are  concerned, they are not ina state of &quot;readiness to fulfil our guarantee.&quot;  As we have pointed out in earlierReports, the strength of the forces of this country is not conditioned by this commit-ment.  To quote an observation we made in an earlier Report on the same subject          &apos;&apos; It follows that, so far as commitments on the Continent are concerned,    the Services can only take note of them.   No specific provision to meet them is    practicable, other than the adoption of such measures of organisation, training    and equipment  as are  essential to enable them to  fight on  the Continent if    required.&quot;  (C.I.D.  Paper No. 701-B, paragraph 9.)*In addition, we have received no instructions  to work out plans in fulfilment of thatguarantee, and in fact detailed plans have not been worked out. This country is ina less favourable position to fulfil the Locarno guarantees than it was, without any&quot;written  guarantee, to come to the assistance of France and Belgium in  1914.                             III. NAVAL POLICY.                            Strength of the Fleet.    10.   The  London Naval Treaty of 1930 will, if  ratified, and  if the  French-Italian  negotiations now proceeding  result in general agreement  on the  tonnagefigures for those Powers,  govern the strength of the fleet in Cruisers,  Destroyers and submarines up to the 31st December, 1936.  Capital Ships and Aircraft Carriers are limited by the  Washington Treaty of 1922, and special provision has  now been madefor accelerating the reduction then  agreed to  in the capital ship strengths and for postponing replacement.    11.   It  is  important to emphasise  in this Annual Review that, in regard toCruisers, the number 70  referred to in our Annual Review for 1928 is  the numberconsidered necessary to meet Imperial Defence requirements, and no circumstancehas arisen to cause the Admiralty to alter their estimate in this respect.    12.   The  tonnage provision  of the London  Naval  Treaty will only permit,however, of  a  number of about 50 Cruisers  actually completed.    This has beenaccepted under existing international conditions  for  the strictly limited period ofthe Treaty up  to the 31st December, 1936, provided that adequate limitations aremade in the projected building programmes  of other Powers,  and provided  thatincluded in the above number is a proper proportion of new construction  suitablefor extended operations.    13.   Steady replacement construction in Cruisers, Destroyers and  Submarinesis  an urgent matter.  The maintenance of only 50 efficient  Cruisers over the next ten years requires the annual laying down of between 3 and 4 Cruisers.    14.   If  one flotilla is laid  down each year it will not  be until 1941 that theLondon  Naval Treaty reduced figures in Destroyer tonnage  will be reached, whilst the reduced  Submarine figures necessitate the laying down of three boats annually.The  Admiralty have, in  fact, gone to the utmost limit in meeting the government policy of limitation and reduction consistent also with the policy of security.  Thej\have done so in the belief that the provisions in the Treaty which  allow for themaintenance of efficiency will be carried out.    15.   It is  pertinent,  however, to emphasise that in agreeing to 50 Cruisers and150,000  tons of Destroyers, the Admiralty have accepted a risk for  a  limited  period,as these numbers are inadequate, relatively,  to the projected continental building programmes, which,  if proceeded with, will necessitate His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United  Kingdom implementing Article 21 of the London Naval Treaty,  andmodifying their anticipated replacement programme.    16.   It  is desired to draw attention to the increasing importance attached tothe Fleet Air Arm.   A steady programme of development of two flights per  annumis considered necessary by the Admiralty to meet essential requirements  in the next five years.    17.   In their  Memorandum  for  the  Imperial  Conference  (C.I.D.  PaperNo. 997-B), the Admiralty have put  forward certain matters for considerationregarding naval policy, including the types of vessels which the Dominions and india are recommended to construct.                        * Also Paper No. CCS. 41, paragraph 9.

                         IV. MOBILITY  OF THE  FLEET.                      Maintenance of Sea Communications.     18.  In  our Annual Review of  Imperial Defence  for 1926  (C.I.D.  Paper No. 701-B),* the following passage occurs :          &quot;The problems of Imperial Defence arise out of the unique conditions of     the British Empire.  Scattered over the globe in every continent and sea, peopled     by  races of every colour and  in  widely differing stages of civilisation,  the     component parts of the Empire have this much in common from the point of     view of defence, that, with  occasional and insignificant exceptions,  they  are     able to maintain order with  their  own resources, supplemented in some cases     by Imperial garrisons maintained  for strategical reasons.  But  for any  longer     emergency requiring mutual support or co-operation they are dependent  on  the     sea communications which unite them.  If those communications are closed, they     become liable to defeat in  detail.   Moreover,  the Mother Country, the central     arsenal and reserve for the whole Empire, is dependent for the essentials  of life     on the maintenance of a network of sea communications extending not only to     the territories of the Empire, but to every part of the world.  The maintenance     of these sea communications, therefore, - is the first principle of our system of     Imperial Defence.   The whole  fabric  is  built upon the assumption of  the     command of the sea.  Unless freedom and security of sea passage throughout     are assured, the system breaks down.&quot;     19.  The responsibility for the security  of sea  passage rests primarily with theRoyal Navy, but in order that it may carry out its functions efficiently, certain portsmust be so protected in peace that, in case of war, they may be used for naval and mercantile marine purposes without much danger  of interference by hostile  naval,land or air forces.  The reduction in the size of the Navy, which has  been  discussed in the previous section  of this Memorandum, tends, if anything, to  increase theimportance of adequate bases and fuelling stations.  The  smaller  the Navy, thegreater the importance of mobility, and for mobility one of the  primary essentialsis a  chain of adequately defended bases and fuelling stations. The same  principleapplies to the Army. The smaller it is, the greater the importance of ensuring thatit can be moved to any threatened  point; but for its mobility within the Empire thearmy is  dependent upon sea transport  and naval protection.  Hence, for  both the older Services, and for the Royal Air Force also, so far as it is dependent, whether directly or  indirectly, on  sea transport, adequately defended naval bases and fuellingstations  are of the first importance.     20.  At  the present time, however,  the bases and  fuelling stations of theEmpire  are  not  adequately defended.   The last  comprehensive revision of the defences took place in the years 1905-6, and, generally speaking, the defences thatexisted during the Great War were the result of the inquiries of those years.     21.  After the War the Committee  of Imperial Defence realised that  the coast defences were out of date and would  have to  be  overhauled in the light of war experience.  Principles were formulated as to the forms and scales of attack to  whichthe various ports are liable, and as to the  forms of defence to be adopted,  and,  onthe basis of those principles, a series of Inquiries was undertaken which resulted inplans being drawn up for the defence of the following ports :          (a) Home Ports.         (&amp;) Colonial ports east of Suez and Indian ports.         (c) Australian and New Zealand Ports.         (d) Singapore.         (e) South African Ports.     22.  Before the review of  Mediterranean,  Atlantic and Canadian ports hadbeen undertaken, these Inquiries  were  brought to  a standstill owing to proposalswhich were made in connection with the preparation of plans for the defences  of singapore, for the employment of aircraft  armed with bombs  or torpedoes  as a substitute for heavy  and medium guns.  No conclusions on this subject  have yetbeen reached.(
    23.  From the above it will be realised that the coast defences  all over theworld are very much out of date.   The defended ports are very much weaker than inpre-war days, since their armament has not been modernised to keep pace with the developments and increased range of naval guns.  The present counter-bombardmentguns have a maximum range of  19,700 yards, as compared with 29,200 yards for-inch naval guns and 38,400 yards for 16-inch naval guns.  In addition,  the ports are almost completely lacking in anti-aircraft defences of all kinds, including guns,lights and aircraft.  The position in the Mediterranean is particularly  weak in thisrespect, the defended ports of Gibraltar and  Malta being liable to air attack  from france and Italy.   Potentially hostile air bases exist within 94 miles and 92 milesrespectively  of these  bases.  Since the &quot;War  very  little has been done to improvematters beyond drawing up  plans, and even  the plans are at present  in  suspense.Only  at Singapore has some preliminary work been done, and even at Singaporeprogress has been restricted&apos; by the decision that there should be no expenditure onthe installation of 9-2-inch and 15-inch guns during the financial year 1929-30, aperiod which has since been extended.    24.  The history  of coast defence shows that drastic  renovations have  been necessary at intervals of approximately 30 years, and the coast defences are now due for one of these periodical overhauls.  The sums that have  been  spent in the pastwhen  renovation has been considered necessary are as  follows :                                                                         rs  (1865  ...        ...       ...       ...     31 millions           W  1 1878  ...        ...       ...       ...     If millions          r.v  ( 1900  ...        ...       ...       ...     51 millions          W  1 1905   ...        ...       ...      ...      -I million    25.  The renovation of our  coast defences  is  overdue,  but should  not  be completely embarked upon until  a decision has been reached as to the best type ofdefence.   Meanwhile,  there  is  no  question  regarding the nature  of  the  lightarmament required for close defence nor in regard to electric lights and anti-aircraft equipment.  We strongly recommend, therefore, that action should be taken at anearly  date  to modernise  these  equipments,  to  renew  electrical communications,without prejudice  to matters of a contentious nature.    26.  The position regarding  ammunition also is far from  satisfactory.  none of the 9 - 2-inch gun ammunition is considered to be suitable for use against modernwarships, and much of the 6-inch gun amnmnition requires modernisation.  At thepresent time,  owing to financial  stringency,  practically nothing is  being done tore-equip  the  coast defences  with up-to-date  ammunition.   We consider  that theexisting  scales of ammunition  held at oversea  ports  will  have to be  increasedconsiderably  before  these  defences can be  regarded as  self-supporting for any reasonable period of time.    27.  Unless the integrity of our sea routes can be secured by providing strong and self-supporting defended naval bases for the Navy,  the  communications of theEmpire cannot be ensured.   Hence the modernisation  of the armament of  the coastfortresses is of paramount importance, and the work recommended above should beput in hand at a very early date, as it will take several years to accomplish, even withample financial provision.    28.  In the preceding paragraphs we have dealt with the general inadequaciesof the existing coast defences as a whole.  We fully recognise that even when agree-ment has been reached as to the  relative efficiency in coast defence of guns and air-craft, financial considerations will prevent for some considerable time the  bringingup to date of all the defended ports throughout the  Empire, and in  the existing international situation we do not consider it urgent to hasten the modernisation ofall of the ports concerned.   We  would, however,  draw attention to the followingbases, the maintenance  of which  in an efficient condition we regard as  essential tothe present-day requirements of Imperial Defence.Singapore.    29.  In our previous Reports we have always considered Singapore in a categoryby itself, and in view  of the decision to bring  up the whole question of the Base for final decision at the forthcoming Imperial  Conference,  we do not propose in this paper to deal with the subject at length.
    30.  We would, however, observe that during the past few years work on themain  contract for the graving dock has proceeded, but other work is  practically ata standstill consequent on the decision to suspend or delay work as far as possibleowing to the London Naval Treaty.   In  this connection we would remark that, inour view, the Treaty introduces no new factor tending to diminish the strategic importance of the Singapore Base, and the need for its development on the lines which have been approved.   The  security of Australia and New Zealand and ofour whole Eastern Possessions rests in the last  resort on an adequate naval base at singapore.    31.  Meanwhile, a floating  dock and valuable supplies of oil fuel have beeninstalled there without any defences.   It has been decided that  a R.A.F. torpedobombing Squadron from the Home  Forces will proceed to Singapore in the Autumnto be based there, but, in addition  to this,  it is,  in our opinion,  of the utmost importance to proceed without delay with the approved parts  of the first stage ofthe defence scheme without prejudice to the decision  already  reached to postponeconsideration of  the second stage until a later date.Hong Kong.    32.  The importance of Hong Kong, in view of its isolated position, cannot be over-estimated.  By the Pacific Treaty we are precluded from increasing the coast defences, and it is therefore of the utmost importance that the efficiency  of thesedefences within the limits imposed should be maintained at as high a level as possible.Approval has already  been given  to  the  recommendation  of the Committee ofImperial Defence that the elevation of the medium coast defence guns at Hong Kongshould be increased.   The design of the new  gun-mounting to enable  this to becarried out has not yet been tested practically, but it is anticipated that the necessarytrials will be completed by next Christmas.    33.  We recommend that authority should be given with due regard to financiallimitations for the reorganisation of the coast artillery, anti-aircraft and searchlightdefences to be proceeded with as soon as possible.Malta.    34.  The necessity for adequate defences at Malta has been greatly enhanced by the reduction of the naval strength of this country vis-a-vis the Mediterraneannaval Powers and the increases in air  forces of these Powers during  recent years,which render the fortress very vulnerable to  air attack.    35.  As indicated  above,  it is not possible  for the  present to proceed withmodernising  the main coast defences, but  we consider that, as soon as circumstances permit, the reorganisation  of the light gun  defences, the defence electric lights, thesignal communications, the anti-aircraft  guns, and the anti-aircraft lights, shouldbe proceeded with.-Gibraltar.    36.  At Gibraltar, also, the light gun defences, the defence electric lights, thesignal  communications, anti-aircraft  guns and  anti-aircraft lights require earlyattention, and with regard to this fortress it will be appreciated that  co-operation by aircraft  in the defence will always be a matter of difficulty, owing to the very limited space available for accommodation of aircraft.CONCLUSIONS.second          37.  Our conclusions with regard to the sea communications between the variousrecommenda.  parts of the Empire may be summarised as follows :-              (a) The  security of our sea  communications  is as  essential  as ever for the                     continued existence  of  the  Empire; adequate defence for the  defended                     ports of the latter&apos;s main lines of communication is an essential factor in                     ensuring that security.              (b) The  armament  of the coast defences  is,  generally  speaking,  in a pre-war                     state and totally inadequate to meet an attack by modern naval forces.
                          Accumulation of Supplies.Fuel Oil.    38.  In view of the increase in the demand for fuel oil which  a war with amaritime Power would cause,  it would be impracticable to ensure an adequate supply for the Fleet unless a  reserve, equivalent to a  year&apos;s war requirements,  wereaccumulated  before the outbreak of war.   The  developments in oil-refining haveincreased the dependence of the Fleet upon such a reserve.    39.  It has been estimated that the reserve  needed is 1\ million tons of fuel oil, of which 4,158,000 tons  are at present in stock.  During the present year noaddition is being made to these stocks,  although an annual addition of 330,000 tons would be required to produce the necessary reserve in the  next ten years, the periodof peace upon  which the Estimates of the Fighting Services are prepared.   TheAdmiralty are  aware of the  financial  stringency which exists, and which resultedin additions of only 100,000 tons being made to stocks in each of the years 1928 and1929.  The mobility of the Fleet is, however,  a vital requirement for the existenceof the British Commonwealth should war occur, and we  therefore urge that a returnshould be made to the policy of an annual provision towards the oil fuel reserve, even  recommenda-if the full amount required by the 10-year rule cannot  be arranged.                to&quot;    40.  The oil fuel reserve for the Navy  is the only  reserve being  created in theBritish Empire.  No reserves are  being accumulated for the mercantile marine orfor civil needs in war.Lubricating Oil.    41.  The naval reserve of lubricating oil stands at present at 10 months&apos; war expenditure, and,  as in the  case  of  fuel oil,  is the only  reserve of this  type of      In particular, the anti-aircraft defences are almost non-existent and are      insufficient to meet even the weakest of air attacks.(c)  It is approximately 30 years since any drastic  renovations to coast defences      have taken place, and they are now due, in any case, for a periodical      overhaul.(d)  Although complete renovation of the coast defences should not be&apos; embarked      upon until a decision has been reached as to the best type of defence, there      is no question regarding the nature of the  light armament required for      close  defences,   nor  in  regard  to electric lights  and  anti-aircraft      equipment.(e)  We would place on record our opinion that the recent London Naval Treaty      introduces no new factor tending to diminish the strategic importance      of the Singapore Base and the need for its development on the lines which      have been approved.(/)  We recommend that approval should be given, with due regard to financial      considerations, for such 6-inch and other light guns as may be  agreed,      the defence electric lights, the signal communications, the  anti-aircraft      guns, and the anti-aircraft lights considered necessary for the following      ports, in  the order  named,  to  be provided or  modernised as soon as      possible :             Hong Kong.            Malta.           , Gibraltar.      We also recommend that, as soon as a suitable type of mounting has      been approved, the work of increasing the elevation of the medium  guns      at Hong Kong, which has already been approved by the Cabinet,  should      be undertaken.(g)  Finally, we would  draw  attention  to  the fact that none  of  the 9 - 2-inch      ammunition  held at defended  ports abroad is  suitable  for use  against      modern warships, and that much  of  the  6-inch ammunition requires      modernisation.          We consider that  the existing scales of ammunition held at oversea      ports will have to be increased considerably before their defences can be      regarded as self-supporting for any reasonable period of time.
lubricating oil in the country.  As the estimated civil and munition factory require-ments  of  lubricating  oil  for  the United  Kingdom  would be approximately524,000 tons in the first year of a war., and the civil stocks maintained do not amountto much more than 78,000 tons,&apos; it may -be appreciated that should  our main sourceo&apos;f supply, the United States of America, be cut off, the machinery in  the  country would be brought to a standstill.                                 Iraq-Mediterranean Oil Pipe-Line.              42.  The situation, so  far. as  oil is concerned, might be  considerably assisted          if Iraq oil were to be brought to a port under British control. &quot;The importance of          Haifa  becoming the terminal of the  Iraq-Mediterranean pipe-line was stressed in          our 1929 Annual Review.              43.  It would  appear that a Syrian alignment would be the most economical,          both on account of capital  outlay and working  charges, and is therefore the most          attractive from  the point of  view of the Iraq Petroleum Company.  The French          Government are doing  all in their power to influence a decision for the northern          alignment.  On  the other hand, the  Iraq Government  hold  strong views on the          desirability of the pipe-line being laid to Haifa, and these  may yet  result in a          southern alignment being adopted.  The policy to be pursued  by His Majesty&apos;s          Government in the  United Kingdom is still under consideration.Fourth          44   -yfe desire to  take the opportunity of  reiterating  our opinion that everyrecommenda.      - r -i   rv     -I-I-II      i             i      i      i&apos;           -i   i    T-*Hon.       possible effort should be made to secure  the southern  alignment, and  that Jb ranee          should not be permitted to obtain the virtual control of  this potential oil supply.                             V. MILITARY POLICY.    45.  The liabilities  imposed upon the  Army* by the National Defence Policymay be summarised as follows :      (a) Assistance in the maintenance of our  sea communications by the provision           of garrisons at important points along our sea routes.    (6) To guarantee law and order throughout those parts of the Empire in which           the Army is primarily responsible.    (c) To safeguard  the land  frontiers of the Empire  for which the Army is           responsible.    (d) To act with Allies in fulfilment of  our commitments.    46.  The normal distribution of the Army to meet the above liabilities is basedon the Cardwell system,  under which an equai number of infantry battalions of theline are maintained at Home and Abroad, each battalion at Home providing themachinery necessary for  training the drafts required for the link battalion overseas.(In the interests of brevity and clarity, infantry organisation only is dealt with.)    47.  Normally,  therefore, the  commitments specified in  (a), (b)  and  (c)  ofparagraph 45 above should absorb exactly  half of  the available  infantry  battalions of the line.  These are distributed, partly as local garrisons in India, Egypt and theSudan, and partly for the defence of the  naval bases  in  the West Indies and at gibraltar, Malta,  Singapore and Hong Kong.  In addition,  however, to  providinglocal  protection,  certain of  the  above foreign garrisons have  a further liability,namely, the provision of local reserves for  dealing with unforeseen situations  thatmay arise in the Middle East and in  the Far  East.    48.   As regards the Middle  East, it has been decided by  His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom  that a force of not less  than  4 battalions should normally  be maintained to reinforce Palestine, Egypt, the Sudan, and,  indeed, anyother area in the  Middle East in which trouble may arise.  These 4 battalions are normally  divided  between Malta and Gibraltar, but at  present two of them are stationed in Palestine.   This is further referred to in paragraph 52.    *  This section deals only with the military forces maintained by His Majest.y&apos;s  Government in the UnitedKingdom and with those parts of the Empire for which  the latter is responsible.
    49.  As regards the Far East, there are at present 5 British battalions and1 Indian battalion distributed between Tientsin (1), Shanghai (2),  and Hong Kong(2 British battalions and 1 Indian battalion).  There is a further reference to this inparagraphs 56 to 61.    50.  The increase in the Far Eastern garrison, which has been necessitated  bytlhe events of the past few years in China, has upset the balance demanded for thesuccessful application of the Cardwell system.  As  a consequence, a certain numberof battalions which ought to be serving in the United Kingdom are now stationed  inEgypt or the Mediterranean.   Further,  a portion of  the  Mediterranean Reservenormally located in Malta has  already been drawn upon  as a  reinforcement forPalestine, where it seems it will be required for some time to come.   This is furtherreferred to in paragraph 52.    51.  Having outlined the liabilities which the national defence policy imposeson the Army, and its general distribution to meeF those liabilities, it is necessary todiscuss the situation in certain areas in rather more detail.Palestine.    52.  In  August 1929 it was necessary  to despatch naval, military and air reinforcements  from  Egypt and Malta to deal with the inter-racial disturbanceswhich  had broken out.   Fortunately, the  state of affairs in  Egypt at that time didnot preclude the immediate despatch of troops from  that country in the first instance,but the provision.of reinforcements from  that area in future cannot be regarded  aseither  certain  or  sufficient.    Consequently,  two British  battalions  from theMediterranean  Reserve (see paragraph 48 above)  are now stationed in  Palestine,which  has thus become a new army commitment, and is  likely  to remain so for sometime.   In addition, arrangements have  been made for the despatch to Palestine,  incase of necessity, of the other two battalions of this Reserve, which would  then  be entirely depleted.Egypt.    53.  Under the  Declaration to Egypt of 1922, the British garrison  in thatcountry is  required to fulfil  a dual  role,  comprising both Imperial  and localresponsibilities.   The first category includes the protection of Imperial communica-tions through Egypt, and the second includes the protection  of foreign interests andminorities  in Egypt.   The proposals recently put  forward by  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment  in the  United Kingdom  for an Anglo-Egyptian  Treaty would,  ineffect, have transferred the local responsibility to the Egyptian Government.  Thenegotiations, however,  broke  down;  and the previous commitments,  therefore,remain.  These  are described by  the Foreign Office (F.O. Memorandum, page 24)*  inthe following language :          &quot; Pending the conclusion of a treaty settlement with Egypt .... we are    committed  not merely to the defence of the Suez  Canal,  but to the defence  of    British communications in Egypt (a much wider expression)  and the protection    of foreign interests.  So long as British troops  remain in Cairo and Alexandria    we cannot, in the last resort, disclaim all responsibility for the maintenance  of    internal order.  British forces in the capital must be strong enough not merely    to look after themselves but to afford protection to the large foreign communities    until outside help can arrive.&quot;The Sudan.    54.  The British garrison of the Sudan at present consists  of 2 battalions  of infantry and one squadron of the Royal Air Force.  The  Committee  of ImperialDefence have recently agreed that, owing to the situation in Egypt, no appreciablereduction in the infantry garrison is practicable at  the present time.  But, in orderto save expenditure on barrack accommodation, it has been decided that the  Cyprusdetachment  of one  company should be furnished by one of  the battalions  in theSudan instead of  from the garrison of Egypt as heretofore.    55.  It would not be right  for us to leave the question of the garrison  of theSudan without  inviting attention to the following  extract from the Foreign  Office[21480]* C.I.D. Paper No. 1008-B (also Paper No. O.O.S. 235).C
Memorandum (page 24)* :  (In the Sudan) &quot;A recrudescence of Egyptian propaganda is to be expected, and may stimulate the growth of local nationalism.  The unrestengendered  by such  activities  can only increase  the danger  of  an  outbreak ofMahdism, which, though  latent, is none the less alive.  On the whole,  therefore,internal  disorder,  rather  than foreign aggression, appears .to constitute the chiefdanger which might call for an increase in the British garrison.&quot;The Far East.    56.  It  Avill be seen from  the Foreign Office Memorandum (reference  page 33)*that &quot; the improvement in the position in China which was evident last year hasnot been maintained.&quot;   Consequently, there appears to be  little likelihood of stability of  Government, or of safety  for unprotected foreigners in China, for sometime to come; and it will, therefore, be necessary for us to continue--probably formany years to be  in a position to afford protection to British subjects and interestsin that country.    57.   In connection with  the above, His Majesty&apos;s Government  in the UnitedKingdom have reaffirmed the  general policy of avoiding dispersion of the british military forces and of concentrating them for the purpose of ensuring :     (a) that the colony of Hong Kong is adequately protected;    (b) that the garrison of Shanghai should be adequate to deal with mob violence;    (c) that His Majesty&apos;s Legation in Peking&quot;, and its communications with the          sea, should be guarded in  co-operation with the other Protocol troops.    58.   So far as the protection of British subjects is  involved, His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom have recently decided that protection should be afforded to  British communities in  the following order  of priority :  Shanghai,Tientsin and Peking, Canton  (Shameen), Hankow; and the existing distribution ofthe British  forces  in China  (see  paragraph 49) has  been  made  with  a  view toimplementing this policy.    59.   His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have also decided that,when the situation in China becomes more stabilised, the two battalions  at Shanghaishould be moved to Hong Kong, but, as it  is pointed out in the Foreign  office memorandum (page 35),* &apos;&apos; the reasons for the retention of British troops in Shanghairemain in force, particularly  in view of the  definite deterioration of  the internal situation in China which has taken place during the past year and  of the seriousbreaches which faction has made in the ephemeral facade of national unity.&quot;    60.   As soon  as it is possible to withdraw the Shanghai  Defence  Force, thedistribution of infantry units in China is to be :  Hong Kong, 5 battalions; Pekingand Tientsin, 1 battalion.  This will enable the General Officer  Commanding inChina to make available 4 battalions  to deal with any trouble that may threaten the lives and property of British  subjects in China,  as well as leaving one battalion at tientsin and Hong Kong respectively.     61.   In conclusion, we think it right to invite attention to the following extractfrom the Foreign Office Memorandum  (reference page 35)* :  &quot;In view of the seriouslikelihood of ....  emergency arising from the unpredictable vicissitudes of civil war, it is plain that a further reduction of the China garrison could not  at present be undertaken without exposing British lives and interests to serious danger.&quot;                               VI. AIR POLICY.     62.   The responsibilities devolving upon the  Royal Air Force  at the presenttime are as  follows :       (i)  The provision of the air  defences of the United Kingdom.   In this com-           commitment the Army assists by the  provision of  the ground  anti-aircraft            defences.   From the Home Defence Force would also be  drawn the air            forces required for any major war overseas.     (ii)  The provision of the Admiralty requirements for the  Fleet Air Arm.     (iii) The provision of  the  Royal Air Force  contingents to the  Expeditionary            Force.                    * 0.I.D Paper No. 1008-B (also Paper No. O.O.S. 235).
     (iv) The  control  or  command  in certain territories,  viz., Iraq,  Palestine,           Trans-Jordan, Aden.     (v) Assistance in the maintenance of our sea communications in narrow waters           and in the defence of naval bases.     (vi) Assistance in the development of Imperial air routes.    63.  For the purpose of carrying out all these diverse responsibilities, the totalfirst-line strength of the  Royal Air Force at the present time is 780 aircraft, ofwhich 476  are normally stationed at home.   It is of interest to note,  in connectionwith this latter figure, that France disposes, at the present time, of  a strength of1,300 aircraft.                      Home Defence  and Oversea Reserve.    64.  The provision of air forces for Home Defence and Oversea Reserve up tothe strength authorised is proceeding slowly.  It will be remembered that theestablishment originally authorised was 52 squadrons in  1922,* to be completed by1928; since then, in view of the general political situation and the need for financialeconomy, this  programme has been progressively retarded.  The  actual existingstrength at the present time is 38 squadrons, and the intention is  to complete theprogramme by  1938.  It will  thus be  seen that,  so  far as the provision  for-HomeDefence and the  Oversea Reserve is  concerned,  the Royal Air Force  is  still 14squadrons under strength.                                Coast Defence.    65. (i) The provision of air units to assist in the protection of  sea communica-tions is still far below what would be the essential requirements in war.  One moreflying-boat squadron is being formed, and its location at Hong  Kong is projected.    (ii) Development work with a view to  increasing the value of air  forces forcoast defence has  made progress.  Tests of a bomb sight designed  for use againstmoving warships have been carried out with satisfactory results.  Further trials areprojected for .1931. -                   Air Defences at Defended Ports Abroad.    66.  As already  mentioned  in  paragraph 31, one  torpedo bomber squadronproceeds to Singapore  this autumn.  Some of our defended ports are still  without adequate landing grounds for their defence.  At Malta a site for a second aerodrome,which is necessary for the accommodation of the air forces normally  located there inpeace, has been selected, but the purchase of the site has  not yet been  sanctioned.                         Iraq, Palestine,  Trans-Jordan.    67.  The Royal Air Force units maintained in these territories have remained unchanged during the last year.   A treaty has been negotiated with the King ofIraq to regulate the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomvis-a-vis  Iraq when  that  country is  admitted  to the  League  of Nations.   Theprovisions of this treaty will affect the present  strength and location of the RoyalAir Force.  It is unnecessary, however,  to include details of the proposals in this review.  It will be sufficient to know that our interests so far as Imperial air routesare concerned will be fully safeguarded.                                    India.    68.  The re-equipment of Royal Air Force squadrons in India with up-to-dateaeroplanes  hao progressed  satisfactorily, and there remain  only four  squadrons of old types.F21480J* 163rd Meeting-, C.I.D., Conclusion 2.
                             Imperial Air Routes.    69.  The  strength  of  the air  forces that have  to be  maintained in overseascommands depends to no small degree upon the possibility of rapid inter-reinforce-ment.  Given adequate air  routes, properly equipped bases and refuelling facilities,air forces are  the most mobile of all forces; without such routes and bases they arestrategically the least mobile.    70.  Some progress has been  made  towards the completion of  the  chain ofImperial air routes.   The air route along the Arabian littoral of the  Persian Gulfhas been flown throughout  by flying boats, and certain minor facilities, e.g., petroldumps, moorings,  &amp;o, are  being provided along the route.  It is expected that land planes will fly down the route this Autumn.  The route  is as yet, however, by nomeans complete.  Meanwhile  the  use of the Persian littoral would have  to bedepended on,  and this might, in war, prove impossible owing to the neutrality of persia.  The completion of the Arabian route should therefore be pressed forward.    71.  The  section from India  to Singapore has  been completed  so far as the seaplane facilities are concerned, and will be completed for land  planes before theend of this year.   It has  been flown  by flying  boats in  both directions duringthe monsoon.   Certain maintenance facilities are not as yet completed on the route,but by the end  of the year the route will be fit  for  use in  emergency by&apos; Serviceaircraft.  Service  flights should be carried out by land planes on this route.    72.  The  section Singapore-North Borneo has been-flown by flying  boats, but its organisation has not yet been taken in hand.  It will form a part of the prepara-tions  for the air reinforcement of Hong Kong, should this ever become necessary inthe future, and its organisation should therefore be proceeded with.    73.  Now that a squadron is located at Aden, an air  route between Muscat andAden  is to be organised to connect with the Imperial trunk route  at the formerpoint. The preliminary reconnaissance is proceeding, but  it will probably be anotheryear before it  is suitable for emergency use by Service aircraft.                Developments in the Employment of Air Forces.    74.  Considerable effort has been directed in recent years to increasing the scope and capacity of air forces for employment in the system of Imperial Defence, notonly as regards the contingency of a major war, but also in oversea defence duties in normal times of peace. Progress in many directions has been achieved.    75.  In the latter role much practical experience has been gained in undevelopedterritories, where conditions suitable to their employment exist, of the new methods which have been made possible by the use of air forces for maintaining or restoringorder among semi-civilised peoples with the least expense to both sides in lives and money.  Full details  as  regards these  developments have been included in C.I.D.Paper No. 1005-B and need not be repeated here.                                    (Signed)       G. F.

APPENDIX  I.RESOLUTIONS ON  DEFENCE.Conclusions reached by the Imperial Conference, 1926, reaffirming and expanding              the Resolutions of the Imperial Conference of 1923.    &apos;&apos; THE Conclusions reached by  the Imperial  Conference on  the  subject ofDefence may be summarised as follows : &apos;        1. The Resolutions on Defence adopted at the last session of the Conference    (see page 36) are reaffirmed.        2. The Imperial. Conference regrets that it has not been possible to make    greater progress with the international reduction and limitation of armaments    referred to in these Resolutions.   It is the common desire of the Governments    represented at  this Conference to do their utmost  in pursuit of this object so    far as this is  consistent with the safety and integrity of all parts of the Empire    and its communications.        3. The Conference recognises that, even after a large measure of reduction    and limitation of armaments has been achieved, a considerable effort will be    involved in order to maintain the minimum standard of naval strength contem-    plated in the  Washington Treaty on Limitation of Armament, namely, equality    with the naval  strength of any foreign Power.   It has noted the statements set    forth by the Admiralty as  to the formidable expenditure required within    coming years for the replacement of warships, as  they  become obsolete, by    up-to-date ships.        4. Impressed with the vital importance of ensuring the security  of the    world-wide trade routes  upon which the safety and welfare of all parts of the    Empire depend, the representatives of Australia, New Zealand, and India  note    with special  interest the steps  already taken by His Majesty&apos;s  Government in    Great  Britain  to develop the  Naval Base  at Singapore, with the object of    facilitating the free movement of the Fleets.  In view of the heavy expenditure    involved, they  welcome the spirit of co-operation  shown in the contributions    made with the  object of  expediting this work.        5. The  Conference  observes that  steady progress has been made  in the    direction of organising military formations in general on similar lines;  in the    adoption of  similar patterns of weapons; and in the interchange of Officers    between different parts of the Empire; it invites the Governments concerned to    consider the possibility  of  extending these forms of  co-operation and of    promoting further consultation between the respective General Staffs on defence    questions adjudged of common interest.        6. (a)  The Conference takes note  with  satisfaction  of the substantial    progress that has been made since  1923 in building up the Air  Forces  and    resources of the several parts of the Empire.        (b) Recognising that the fullest mobility is essential to the effective  and    economical employment  of air power, the  Conference recommends, for the    consideration of  the  several  Governments,  the adoption  of the  following    principle :             The necessity for creating and maintaining an adequate chain of air        bases and refuelling stations.        (c) Impressed with the desirability of still closer co-ordination in this as in    all other spheres of common interest, and in particular with the advantages    which  should follow from a more  general dissemination of  the  experience    acquired in the use of this new arm under the widely varying conditions which    obtain  in different parts of  the  Empire,  the Conference  recommends  for    consideration by the Governments interested the adoption  in  principle of a    system of mutual interchange of individual Officers for liaison and other duties,    and of complete air units, so far as local  requirements and  resources permit.        7.  The  Conference  recognises that the  defence of  India already throws    upon the Government of India  responsibilities of a specially onerous character,    and takes note of their decision to create a Royal Indian Navy.
      8. The Conference notes with satisfaction that considerable progress in the direction  of closer co-operation  in  Defence matters has  been effected  by the reciprocal attachment of naval, military, and air Officers to the Staff Colleges and other technical establishments maintained in various parts of the Empire, and invites  the  attention of  the Governments represented  to  the  facilities afforded by the new Imperial Defence College in London for  the education of Officers in the broadest aspects of strategy.      9. The Conference takes note of the developments in the organisation of the  Committee of Imperial Defence since the session of 1923.  It invites the attention  of the  Governments  represented at the Conference  to  the following Resolutions  adopted,  with a  view  to consultation in questions of common defence, at  a  meeting of the  Committee of Imperial  Defence  held  on the 30th May, 1911,  in connection  with the Imperial Conference of that year  :-          &apos; (1) That one or more  representatives appointed by the &apos; respective      Governments of the Dominions  should be invited to attend meetings of the      Committee of Imperial  Defence when  questions of  naval and military*      defence  affecting the Oversea Dominions are under consideration.          (2)  The proposal that a Defence Committee should be established in      each Dominion is accepted  in principle.  The Constitution of these Defence      Committees is a matter for each Dominion to decide.&apos; NOTE. The  Resolutions of the Imperial Conference of 1923  on  Defence  wrerefollows :       1. The Conference affirms that it is  necessary to provide  for the adequate defence of the territories and  trade of  the several countries comprising the British Empire.      2. In this connection the Conference expressly recognises  that it is  for the Parliaments of the several parts of the Empire, upon  the recommendations of their respective  Governments,  to decide  the nature and extent of any action which should be taken by them.      3. Subject to this provision, the Conference  suggests  the  following as guiding principles :       (a) The primary responsibility of each  portion of the Empire represented            at the Conference for its own  local defence.      (&amp;) Adequate provision for  safeguarding the maritime communications of            the several parts of the Empire, and the routes and waterways along            and through which  their armed forces and trade pass.      (c)  The provision of Naval bases and facilities for repair and fuel so  as to            ensure the mobility of the fleets.      (d) The desirability of the maintenance of  a minimum standard of Naval            Strength,  namely, equality with the Naval Strength of any  foreign            Power, in accordance with the provisions of the Washington Treaty            on Limitation of Armament as approved by Great Britain, all the&apos;            self-governing Dominions and India.      (e)  The desirability of the  development of the Air Forces in the  several            countries  of the Empire upon such  lines as will make it possible,            by means of the adoption, as far  as practicable, of  a common system            of organisation and training and  the use  of uniform manuals,            patterns of arms, equipment  and stores (with the exception of the            type of aircraft), for each part of the Empire as it may determine            to co-operate with other parts with the least possible  delay and the            greatest efficiency.      4. In the application of these principles to the several parts of the  Empire concerned, the  Conference takes note of -      (a) The deep interest of the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of            New  Zealand,  and  India,  in the provision of  a Naval Base at            Singapore, as essential for ensuring the mobility necessary to  provide            for the security  of  the territories  and trade of the Empire in            Eastern Waters.      (b) The necessity for the maintenance of safe passage along the great  route            to the East through the Mediterranean and the Red  Sea.* The words &quot; and air &quot; would be required to bring- the resolution up to date.
     (c) The necessity for the maintenance by Great Britain of a Home Defence           Air Force of sufficient strength to give adequate protection against           air attack by the strongest air  force within striking distance  of her           shores.     5. The Conference,  while deeply concerned for the paramount importanceof providing for the safety and integrity  of  all parts of the Empire, earnestlydesires, so far  as is consistent with this consideration, the further limitationof armaments,  and trusts  that no opportunity may be lost  to promote thisobject.&quot;APPENDIX  II.    Summary of Main Principles governing the Problem of Imperial Defence.    &quot; 4.   As a preface to our report,* it may be convenient if we quote from our lastreviewt the following summary  of the main principles  governing the problem ofimperial defence as set forth in our first annual review:): :         &apos; 5. The maintenance of sea communications  is the first principle of the    system of imperial defence, and the major share of this responsibility still rests    with His Majesty&apos;s  Government in Great Britain. Apart from this, the chief    principle is that, on the one  hand, each of the several Dominions is responsible    for its internal security and for protecting its territory and coastal trade against    aggression until  support arrives from outside, while, on the other  hand, His    Majesty&apos;s Government  in Great Britain, in addition to its duty to  defend its    own territory, is mainly responsible for         The  security of the communications between  the  several  parts  of the             Empire.        The provision of adequate defences in the non-self-governing Colonies and             Protectorates  and in those  mandated  territories assigned to  Great             Britain which are not in a position to defend themselves.        The protection  of our interests in foreign countries generally and of our             special position in Egypt.       -6. On these  principles the commitments  devolving chiefly upon  the armed    forces maintained by His Majesty&apos;s-Government in Great Britain are         The maintenance of our sea communications.  This commitment is  mainly             naval, supplemented by military and air forces in narrow seas.        Assistance in the above  by the provision of defences both at fuelling  bases             and  important points on the  routes, and  also in  the  Colonies and             Protectorates,  to enable these to hold out  until relief arrives.  This is             mainly a military commitment supplemented by air forces.        The maintenance of an Army and Royal Air Force expeditionary force.        The provision of the air defences in Great Britain,  from which source also             has to be found the air striking force for any major war abroad.  This             is an air commitment in  which  the  army  assists by providing land             anti-aircraft defences.        The fulfilment, so far as  our resources and the situation allow, of our treaty             commitments under  the Locarno Treaty.        The provision and development  of  Imperial air communications and air             ports.        The  control of   the  mandated  territories of  Iraq,  Palestine   and             Trans Jordan.&apos;  &quot;* C.I.D. Paper No. 948-K; also Paper No. O.O.S. 191.t G.I.U.
