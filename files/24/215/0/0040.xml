By instruction of the  rime Minister, the attached   note  on the  Policy of Budgetary Limitation of armaments,   prepared by  the Chief of the Air Staff in accordance with   the instructions  and notes left by the late Secretary oi   State for Air,  is circulated to the Cabinet in connection   with  Item 5  on the Cabinet Agenda for Wednesday next.

                   DRAFT DISArdviAHEIII COFryEUTIOH.          THE PROPOSED HORSEPOVTER LIMITATION FOR AIRCRAFT,  I,          The proposal to limit the aggregate horsepower  of military aircraft (Articles 8 and 9 of the Draft  Disarmament Convention)  received provisional assent in the  Preparatory Commission for Disarmament at Geneva in 1927,  At that time the United  Kingdom delegate gave his assent&apos;  subject to the determination of a satisfactory mstho-d of  estimating horsepower,  2.          Due to the  intricacies of the  problem,  the many  varying factors which have to be taken into account - for  example,  the type of fuel used,  the altitude  at which the  engine  is  to be employed,  the number  of revolutions per  minute,  the degree of &apos;; supercharg ing&quot;,  - together with the  necessity  for  evolving  a simple  method  of assessment which&apos;. .could be applied  without the necessity  for &quot;supervision1,  it has  not been found possible to  suggest any satisfactory metitad  of  determining horsepower.            In these  circumstances,  the Air ministry  recommended that while we  should  not  oppose  the application of  a horsepower  limit  we  should  not advocate  it.     The  Sub Committee  of the  C.I.D.  on  Reduction  and  Limitation had  at first acquiesced  in  this attitude but subsequently  reversed their conclusion  (the Air Ministry representative dissenting) and recommended the imposition of a horsepower limitation  ;&apos;for what it was worth&quot; .   (See Report of  Sub-Committee 0.1.D. Taper NO:; 10-3:6-B - attached to CP. 336(30).) 3.          On the assumption that the C.I.D. Sub Committee&apos;s earlier  decision &quot;if possible to evade&quot; a horsepower limitation would be upheld, the late Secretary of State for             &quot;               -1-&quot;
   Air had approved a mer.ioraadu.ro  (attached narked &quot;&apos;.:I) for   tho guidance of tho British dolor-ate to the Prep r story   Commission cn Disarmament,   This  memorandum summarizes   fully the reasons which led the Air Ministry to the   conclusion (a)  that a horsepower li.ita.tion was ineffective   and impracticable on account of the technical difficulties   (paragraph S),  end (b) that the imposition of a limit   calculated upon the possible but admittedly unsatisfactory   basis of the &quot;cubic capacity&quot; of engines was not in the   inter rasts of Croat Britain (paragraph 7) .   4.          It  is neither practicable nor  is it proposed,  to   limit tho horsepower of civil aviation aircraft.   In this   connection the  Air hinistr,;  consider it desirable to add tho   following further note in relation to tha  connection between   the (unlimited) horsepower of civil aviation aircraft and  a   horsepower restriction ap lied to  military aircraft   (paragraph 8(a) of attached):-             The approximate total horsepower of Gorman civil   aviation aircraft (1930)  is 253,400,  of which 146,000   horsepowei  is installed in  77 aircraft considered  to be   capable  of conversion to  some military  use.   The approximate   total horsepower of British civil  aviation aircraft  is   90,000,    The approximate aggregate horsepower  of the   Royal Air  Force Home Defence  bombing  aircraft is 190,000 s   Those figures are more significant  than similar statistics   in relation to  merchant shipping and  warships,  since,  unlike   merino craft, aircraft are able to  strike  a  dix&apos;ect  blow at   vital national  centres.11.10.30.       s  All horsepower figures reckoned  on  a  &quot;cubic   capacity&quot;  bests

Memorandum on the Disarmament Convention proposals concerning the limitation of tho horsepower of              first-line aircraft. 1.           The Preparatory Commission on tho Reduction  and Limitation of Armaments,  adopted  in their text of the second  reading of tho  draft Disarmament Convention (May  1929)  a  provision under Article 8 designed  to  limit the horsepower.cf first-lino aircraft. 2.           The British Delegats  at Goneva  agreed to  the incorporation of this  proposed  limitation,  sub ,i act to a  reservation as  to the evolution of a &quot;satisfactory&quot; method  of  determining  horsepower&quot;. 3.          It should  be  noted  that the imposition  of a horsepower  limitation  was  noithor proposed  nor advocated by the  British Delegate at Geneva.   Agreement to its inclusion  was only given  (subject to the  reservation already mentioned),  in order to secure  the  appearance of unanimity  in  association with  the majority  of thePowers  represented on  the  Commission,  most  of  whom  were in favour  of  this  foriii of  limitation. 4.          Tho Air  Staff  were, and  are opposed  to  such aproposal:   firstly because they consider  that  the practical and technical difficulties of applying  a  horsepower limitation  are suoh as  to  make any  such proposal  eitherineffective or impracticable;  and  secondly because on general and strategic ground, they  ar-j convinced that itwould  bo contrary  to tho interests  of Great Britain.          Whilst the Air Staff have felt it incumbent                        -3-
 upon  them  to  explain  tho  &quot;grays technical diffioultioe in  tho  way  of  devising  a  satisfactory  &quot;basis  for  horsepower liritati on, thoy  fully  appreciate  the  importance,  from the political  standpoint,  of  avoiding  any action at Geneva which might give  the  impression  (however  unjustifiable) that  this  country  is  unsympathetic to  proposals  for making methods of  disarmament  as  effective as possible,.           They do  not,  therefore,  suggest any departure from  our previous  attitude, via. that,  although  we think a simple cloar-cut formula  (such as that  originally pronoeed by us, which makes no attempt to limit  horsapower) would, he preferable,  iis are prepared to accept any workable scheme  for  ouch limitation which mag be proposed,   If it should  be necessary for our representative to submit  a concrete schema (for  example,  to counter  any manifestly impracticable  suggestion  put  forward from other  qu-quarters), the Air Staff  can  only  suggest a rough and ready  scheme under a &quot;cubic-capacity  rule, despite its obvious and grave defects. 5,          In February,  1930, the  CI.D. Sub-Committee 0s the Reduction end  limitation  of Armaments  decided to  recommend to the 0 .1. D,  that our provisional  commitment to the  horsepower limitation clause in Article  C of  the  draft  Disarmament Convention should be evaded if possible. G,          It may, therefore, be useful, for the  information of the British Delegate to be  appointed to the nextPreparatory Cbuaiiss ion at Geneva, to btiauAar iso the reasons which led the Air  Staff to the conclusion that a Horsepowerlimitation  would be impracticable,7.           The objections to  a horsepower limitation a r e: -                          -4-
 A. horsepower limitation apoliod to Military aircraft (and not to Civil aircraft as wo11) may eventually rocult in Civil aircraft having a bettor &quot;performance&quot; then military aircraft. This would mean th-t Civil aircraft (which are not limited i:.  any way)  might come zo  he &quot;better potential bombers than military aircraft;   while the inferior performance cf the military typos would  preclude  tho possibility of tailing effective defence measures,   3ven at the present moment it is  not possible to disregard the offensive potentialities  of  Civil aircraft:   a fact  which her received international recognition in  the form of Article 10 of  the Draft Disarmament Convention,)  In the case of Gre t Britain, with her peculiar geographical situation and widespread  responsibilitie a   orsepower limitation is a re mtivoly far more serious restriction than it would  be to most otherP owers In relation to  offensive potentiality  horsepower does not represent only  capacity  to deliver explosives  or bombs.   It  is also  necessary  totake into  account  the  distance to  bo travelledto and  from the- objective  and  the  starting-point, or base of  operations,Equality  of  horsepower with a  rival ContinentalMr Power having numerical  &quot;parity&quot;  as  regardsaircraft, would mean  our definite  inferiorityin terms  of  effective military  strength.
- G(c)   A horsepower limitation would operate to the     disadvantage of the evolution of long-distance     flying-boats and similar aircraft,  whose     development is of particular and signal importance     to Great Britain,(d)   Any limitation of total horsepower would have the     effect of restricting the size of individual     aircraft engines for use in the Royal Air Force.     In this country, because of the small market     for large civil aircraft, engine development     for civil aviation is largely dependent on the     requirements of the Royal -ilr Force,  and upon     the programme of Service development.     But in countries such as Germany and ^iiaerica,     where there is almost unlimited scope for civil     air-line expansion, it may be expected that the     commercial development of engines for civil use     will proceed side by side with that of engines     for military aircraft.  Civil air transport,     and more especially the large flying-boat as a     part of imperial comaauni cat ions, calls for large     and powerful engines, which our engine industry     could not develop for civil transport alone if     there was no possibility oi the sale of a     successful engine for use in the Royal Air Force.     Moreover, in the event of war we should be at a     disadvantage vis-a-vis countries whose     circumstances and opportunities had fostered the     development oi large engines.(e)   Assuming that the application of a horsepower     limitation was otherwise desirable - an
       assumption to which the Air Staff cannot subscribe -       there would remain the problem of fixing the limits.       This process would involve not only the settlement       of the International &quot;ratios&quot;, but must inevitably       introduce the question of types or categories of       aircraft to be so limited, and the allotment of       horsepower by category.   There are obvious and       grave disadvantages attached to becoming involved       in the complications of any such discussion.   (f) In general a technical - and necessarily detailed       restriction - must inevitably stimulate competition       in engineering technique tending towards evasion       of the limits to be applied.   (g) A satisfactory form of International limitation       must be both simple and effective,  A horsepower       limitation cannot be made either simple, definite,       or effective.8.        Technically, and on grounds of practicability, theobjections to a horsepower limitation may be summarised asfollows:-   (a) The horsepower of a given aviation engine is       dependent upon a number of varying factors, such as,       the number of revolutions per minute of the       crankshaft,  - the type and quality of fuel used, -.       the altitude at which the engine is to be employed,  -       the reliability or &quot;expectation of useful life&quot;       of the engine, - the degree of &quot;supercharging&quot;       to be applied, - etc.   (b) The horsepower of an aviation engine can be       &quot;calculated&quot; from a quantitive characteristic       such as the &quot;cubic capacity&quot; of the engine, but
only when arbitrary assumptions are made asto the various factors mentioned at (a) above.The &quot;calculated horsepower&quot; of an engine consequentlybears no relation to the actual power output.  Porexample, it is possible to increase the horsepowerof an engine by 100&apos;,, as a result of &quot;supercharging&quot;.The definite determination of the horsepower of anyengine can only be arrived at through actual testscarries, out under expert supervision and under&quot;standard&quot; conditions.   The horsepower will varyif any of the standard conditions are varied.The horsepower of an engine at ground level  -though normally greater than at an altitude  - bearsno fixed relation to its horsepower at an altitude.It can happen,, and in the case of certain super-charged engine it does happen, that the horsepowerat 10,000 feet is actually greater than at groundlevel.No horsepower assessment - whether &quot;calculated&quot;, or determined by test - can be either definite,or even satisfactory as a basis of comparison.It is not possible to formulate a practicalhorsepower definition which is not readily susceptible to technical evasion in a variety of different ways.A. formula to determine the horsepower of theordinary type of petrol-driven aviation enginesuch as is commonly used to-day, would not be suitable for application to engines of a differenttype such, for example, as of the &quot;two-stroke&quot;,or Diesel, design.  The possible evolution of a
       turbine type engine would also necessitate       another set oi&apos; rules and formulae.9.     fhe   r Staff are aware that many of the points referred to above are unsuitable for presentation at anInternational Conference.   They consider it desirable,however, that the British Delegate charged with the duty of negotiating the Disarmament Convention should be inpossession of all the relevant military considerationsbearing upon the matter at issue.Air Staff.28. oe gO.
