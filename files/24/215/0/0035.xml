MEMORANDUM  BY THE  SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR  FOREIGN AFFAIRS.    IN June a memorandum was prepared in the Foreign Office (Annex 1) recording-how matters stood  in  connection with the proposals made by the United  StatesGovernment on the 29th December, 1927, as  modified by their  later suggestion ofthe 20tlh  March, 1928, for a new Arbitration Treaty to replace the now defunctRoot-Bryce Treaty of 1908. This memorandum, with the papers attached thereto and referred to in its text, was discussed at my direction at a meeting of the ForeignOffice Committee on Disarmament  and Arbitration held on the 15th  July.   Theminutes of this meeting are attached (Annex 2).    2.  It will be seen that  the Committee came to the conclusion that, while  itwould be preferable, in the light of the failure of the United States proposals to register any real advance in the sphere of arbitration, to leave  the  question  of thenew Anglo-United States treaty alone, it would be undesirable to avoid discussing itat the forthcoming Imperial  Conference.   (In  arriving  at this  conclusion theCommittee were influenced by the knowledge that, during the first year or so afterthe receipt of the United States draft, the State Department  had been given tounderstand that our delay in replying to their proposals was due to the necessity of consulting  the  Dominions;  should  the United  States Government return to thecharge after the Imperial Conference this excuse would no longer hold good.)  TheCommittee then recommended  that the following procedure should be submitted tothe Imperial Conference : To make no move until the United  States Governmentagain sought to learn our attitude towards their draft treaty, when  we should suggest that they should sign the Optional Clause.  In making such a suggestion weshould be  merely  following  the procedure  adopted in the case  of  arbitrationnegotiations with other Powers.  In the  very probable event of the United  StatesGovernment rejecting this proposal, we would agree to accept their  draft with any alterations in  form required  to meet the  present constitutional  position of theDominions and an amendment in the sense they themselves have suggested to providefor the compromis being agreed to by the entities of the British  Commonwealth &quot; inaccordance with their Constitutions.&quot;    3.  In view7 of the -detailed explanations  contained in the annexes to thismemorandum, it is unnecessary here to set out again the various problems raised bythe United  States draft ,treaty, except to re-emphasise that  its  value  from thearbitral point of view  is rendered almost nugatory, notwithstanding the abandon-ment of the &quot; vital  interests &apos;&apos; clause, by the provision that,  so far as  the UnitedStates is concerned, agreement on the compromis can only be reached &apos;; by and with      [21628]                                                         B-
 the advice and consent of the Senate.&quot;  In practice this leaves it open to the Senate to refuse arbitration whenever it so desires.   The fact that no exception was taken to a similar provision in the 1908 treaty makes it difficult to reject the draft treaty on this ground alone. Our only justification for rejecting now what was accepted in 1908 would be the dropping of  the general clause excluding vital interests which formed a part of the earlier treaty.  But to advance this ground for our action would lead straight to the discussion of the belligerent rights question.     4.   Owing to   the  difference  between the  British  and United  States Constitutions,  parliamentary control of the compromis could never be made exactly parallel.  If,  however,  paragraph 2 of Article 1 of the  United States draft were amended to read as follows,  the British Commonwealth would always have the power to delay matters, while it would  be open to Parliament to insist on any alterations considered necessary  in the  compromis :          &quot; The special  agreement in each case shall  be  made on the part of  the     United States of America by the President of the United States of America by     and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, and on the part of His     Majesty&apos;s dominions by His Majesty the King in accordance with constitutional     practice.&quot;     The expression &quot; His Majesty&apos;s dominions &quot;  used  in this sense means the wholeof the British Empire and not the self-governing Dominions.     5.   Since the consideration of this question by the Foreign Office Committee on Disarmament and Arbitration on the. 15th July, it has been recalled that in the last paragraph of Article 2 of the Root-Bryce Treaty of 1908 (Annex 3) it was provided that agreements relating to the compromis  &quot;  shall be  binding only when confirmed by the two Governments by an  exchange of notes.&quot;  In the exchange  of  notes accompanying the signature of the treaty it was explained that  this  provision had been inserted &quot; in order  to reserve to both Governments the freedom of action secured by the United States Government under their Constitution until any agreement whichmay have been arrived at shall have been notified  to be finally binding and operative by an exchange of notes.&quot;  As  such an arrangement helps to put us on a footing of greater equality with the United States, it is for consideration whether the insertion of a similar provision in the proposed new treaty might be suggested to the United States Government.

ANNEX 1.                MEMORANDUM PREPARED  IN  THE FOREIGN OFFICE.     ON the 29th December, 1927, Mr. Frank B. Kellogg, at that time Secretary ofState of  the  United  States,  communicated to  His  Majesty&apos;s  Ambassador atWashington (Sir Esme Howard)  the draft of a new Anglo-American arbitration treaty to  replace the Root-Bryce Treaty of 1908, which was due to expire  (andactually did expire) on the 4th June, 1928.  The Kellogg draft of the 29th December,1927, w^as superseded on the 20th March, 1928, by a revised draft treaty (Appendix I),which, however, differed only in some minor particulars from  the first draft.     From the  outset there  have  been  delays in  dealing with the United  states proposals for a new arbitration treaty, and the first of these arose through the factthat the spring and summer  of  1928 were largely occupied in the negotiations whichconcluded so satisfactorily  in the signature of the Multilateral  Treaty for  theRenunciation of War.   It was therefore not until the  17th October of that year thatthe Cabinet referred to the Sub-Committee on Belligerent Rights of the  Committeeof Imperial Defence the question of the renewal of our arbitration treaties whichhad  expired or  were about to expire.   The report of the Sub-Committee, which dealtvery fully with the issues  raised by their consideration of  Mr.  Kellogg&apos;s  draftarbitration  treaty, was issued  on  the  13th  February, 1929,  as CP.  40  (29)(Appendix II).     Put  very briefly, the main question  was whether  His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentcould accept an arbitration treaty with the United States under which this country would be obliged to submit to arbitration any question arising  out of the exercise ofits belligerent  rights  in any future  war  in  wdiich it might be engaged, either inpursuance of its obligations under Article 16 of the Covenant  of the  League ofNations or independently  of the League.     The  conclusion of  the long  deliberations of the Sub-Committee  is shown onpage 13 of  the report; a majority  consisting of five members of  the committee considered that the American draft  should be accepted, subject to certain amend-ments, and that maritime belligerent  rights should not be excluded  from the  scopeof the treaty; a minority  consisting of three members of the Committee  consideredthat the American draft, with  certain amendments, should be  accepted, but subjectto an intimation that maritime belligerent rights must be reserved from its operation now such time as agreement had been reached as to what those rights were.     Of the amendments on which both the majority and minority of the Committeewere in agreement, two were of special  importance :      1. The  United States  draft treaty, like  all  recent  American  arbitration          treaties, contains a  stipulation that the &quot;special agreement&quot; which is          to settle the terms of reference relating to a dispute to  be snbmitted to          arbitration must  in  each case be made &quot;with the advice  aa   consent of          the  Senate.&quot;   This one-sided  arrangement gives the United States a          considerable  advantage because the Senate could in practice render the          arbitration treaty nugatory in respect of any dispute which  it did hot          wish to see  referred to arbitration by the simple expedient of rejecting          or radically amending the relevant special agreement.   The Committee          accordingly proposed  that the American  draft  should  be  amended by          providing that  the &quot;special agreement&quot; should be, made in each case by          the King with  the approval  of the Parliament or  Parliaments of such          part or parts of his dominions as may be concerned.  By the addition of          the  words in  italics  the  Parliaments of  the Empire  are placed  on          practically the  same footing  as the Senate so far as the approval of a          special  agreement under  the arbitration  treaty is concerned.  There          remains, however, this difference, that in the United States  only the          Senate has to approve, and its approval must be by a two-thirds majority,          whereas in this country and the Dominions the special agreement would          have to go before both Houses of Parliament, and the approval would          be signified by majority vote.      [21628]                                                       B 2
    2. The second important amendment proposed by the Committee relates to the          reservation from the scope of the draft treaty of any dispute the subject-          matter of which  &apos;&apos; depends upon  or involves  the  maintenance of the          traditional  attitude   of   the  United  States  concerning  American          questions, commonly described as the Monroe doctrine.&quot;  In view of the          special interests which this country has in certain regions of  the world,          the  Committee  recommended that this American reservation should be          amended  so as to  read as  follows:  &apos;&apos; depends upon or involves the          maintenance of the policy  proclaimed in the past by either of the high          contracting parties in relation to particular  areas  wherein such party          possesses  special interests which it is bound to uphold in the interests of          its security.&quot;    Up to the time of  the  dissolution in the summer  of 1929 the Cabinet  had reached no decision with reference to the recommendations of the Committee, and thematter therefore remains where it was left by that Committee in February  1929.    During the course of the deliberations of the Sub-Committee consultation tookplace with the Dominions  regarding the United  States proposals, and a digest oftheir replies (except  that of the Irish Free State)  was printed for the Committee ofImperial  Defence in January 1929  (B.R. 70)  (Appendix III).   When the  IrishFree State replied towards the end  of March 1929 their despatch expressed noviews upon the pros and cons of the  Kellogg draft, but merely intimated that, intheir view, it would  be preferable (or words to that  effect) if the United  States andthe Irish Free State had their own arbitration  treaty.  Later  (at&apos; the end ofApril  1929) Mr.  Walshe,  the Irish  Secretary  of External Affairs, expressed theopinion in the course of a  conversation with Sir E.  Harding that so many  different views had been expressed on the  Kellogg draft  that he despaired of any agreement being arrived  at through inter-imperial correspondence.   In the circumstances, thewhole question might be left  over until the Imperial Conference.    When His Majesty&apos;s  present Government assumed  office last year, the navalquestion at once came to the front, and soon active negotiations were  taking place between  the Prime  Minister and  the United  States Ambassador.  As it became apparent  very early  that if these negotiations were successful they would culminatein a  five-PowTer  naval conference, it was  decided,  in  the light  of  their  prime importance, not to risk over-congesting the Anglo-American agenda by concurrentlydiscussing other questions  likely  to prove contentious,  particularly with reference tothe delicate topic of belligerent  rights,  which neither the Americans nor ourselveswished to see injected into the naval conversations.  And so no action was  taken onthe arbitration treaty, and so matters stand to-day.     It  is perhaps  pertinent  to add  that  since Mr. Kellogg was  succeeded byMr.  Stimson in March 1929, we have been subjected tq  no sort of pressure  by theUnited States Government to expedite a reply on the arbitration treaty.  Mr. Kelloggtook  a  deep  personal interest  in  his  &quot;model   treaties,&quot;  and although  theDepartment of State have,  since  his departure, proceeded to negotiate  bilateraltreaties of this kind with a large number of foreign countries, the absence of thelate Secretary of State&apos;s  personal touch is  evident.  Nevertheless and  notwith-standing the existence between Great Britain and the United States of the &quot; Bryan &quot;conciliation  treaty  of 1914,  which, it may  reasonably be  argued,  renders an arbitration treaty superfluous-it will hardly be  possible to postpone indefinitely adecision on  our attitude towards Mr. Kellogg&apos;s proposals.  In  the first place, these&quot;model&quot; arbitration treaties are regarded  by the United States Government asbeing  complementary to their conciliation treaties, while, in  the  second  place, itwould be hard to defend publicly a decision not to negotiate an arbitration treaty with the  United States.   But, inasmuch as  two-and-a-half years have now elapsedwithout any unfortunate results  since the Kellogg draft was first submitted to us, itwould appear advisable to wait a few more months and thereby benefit  by making it possible for the various problems raised to be discussed at the  Imperial  Conferencenow so shortly to assemble.

TPIE President of the United States of America and  His Majesty  the  king of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor ofIndia, determined to prevent  so far as in their power lies any interruption in the peaceful relations that have happily existed between the two nations for more than a century,  desirous  of reaffirming their adherence  to the policy of submitting toimpartial decision all justiciable controversies that  may arise between them, andeager by their example not only to  demonstrate their condemnation of war as an instrument of national policy in their mutual relations, but  also to hasten the timewhen the perfection of  international arrangements for the  pacific settlement ofinternational disputes shall have eliminated forever the possibility of war among anyof the Powers of the world, have decided to conclude a new Treaty of Arbitrationenlarging the scope  and  obligations of  the  Arbitration  Convention,  signed atWashington on the 4th April, 1908,  which expires by limitation on the 4th June,1928. and for that purpose they have appointed as their respective plenipotentiaries:     The President of the United States of America,     His  Majesty the King of Great Britain,  Ireland and  the  British dominions beyond the Seas,  Emperor of India,who having communicated to one another their full powers,  found in good and dueform, have agreed upon the following articles :                                   ARTICLE 1.

The special agreement in each case shall  be made on the part of the UnitedStates of America by the President of the United States of America by  and  withthe advice and consent of the Senate thereof, and on the part of the British empire in accordance with the constitutional laws of the British Empire, His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment reserving the right before concluding a special agreement in any matteraffecting the interests of  a self-governing Dominion of the British Empire to obtainthe concurrence therein of the Government of that Dominion.                                  ARTICLE 2.     The provisions of this treaty shall not be invoked in  respect of any dispute thesubject-matter of which      (a.)

REPORT.                                 Introductory.    1.  THIS  Interim Report does not deal specifically with our main reference onthe question of  Belligerent Rights at Sea, but only with a cognate subject which was referred  to  us by  the  Cabinet  at its   meeting on  the  17th  October,  1928(Cabinet 47  (28),  Conclusion  5),  namely, the  question  of the  renewal  of ourArbitration Treaties which have expired or are about to expire.    2.  The  Root-Bryce General  Arbitration  Treaty  of  1908  expired  on the4th June, 1928, and in March 1928 the draft of a new Treaty was received from washington for the consideration of the British Government.  While the draft wasunder consideration by the Cabinet,  the Kellogg Pact for the Renunciation  of war was proposed.  As  it cut across the question of  the renewal  of  the  Root-BryceTreaty further  examination of the latter was  postponed  for a while.    3.  Meanwhile, the Arbitration Treaty with France expired on the 14th October,though steps have been taken to renew it indefinitely until such time as a new treaty is  negotiated.  The  Arbitration  Treaties  with Italy  and Spain will  expire  thismonth, and we  have at present no Arbitration Treaty with Germany.    4.  So far  as we ourselves are concerned, we should feel no difficulty in renewingthese  Treaties approximately in their original form.  The present difficulty arisesowing to the desire of other parties to the Treaties  to exclude from the new versionthe existing reservation of questions involving the &quot; vital interests, the independence,or  the honour  &quot; of the contracting  parties.  The draft Treaty  forwarded byMr. Kellogg  in March 1928 excludes certain  other matters from the scope of theTreaty, such as those within the  domestic  jurisdiction of  either of the highcontracting parties, those  involving the  interests of third  parties,  the  monroe doctrine, and our commitments under the  Covenant of the League of Nations, but does not exclude matters of  &quot;vital interest.&quot;   The  similar exception of &quot;vital interests &quot; has been dropped from the Franco-American Treaty, and from Treatiesconcluded  between  the  United  States  and  Albania,  Austria,  Czecho-Slovakia,Denmark, Finland,  Germany,  Italy and Poland, and is likely to be  excluded from anumber of treaties with other States which are now in course of negotiation.  TheForeign Office have also received a private intimation  that the French  Governmentwould be disappointed if His Majesty&apos;s Government  asked for a  renewal of the arbitration Treaty on the old terms, and we are  satisfied that the United States  ofAmerica would refuse to renew the Root-Bryce Treaty on those terms.    5.  It  is clear,  therefore,  that,  whether wisely or unwisely,  whether as  atemporary phase or as a definite stage in the advance of arbitration,  the opinion  ofthe world,  under American inspiration, has set against  the reservation of &quot;vital interests.&quot;   For the  British  Government,  therefore,  to refuse to  enter  on  newArbitration Treaties unless  &quot; vital interests &quot; were  reserved would be a  very serious matter. In view of the attitude of the United States  of America,  it would, in theopinion of the Foreign Office, amount to a refusal to negotiate any arbitration treaty with America.   Both at home and abroad,  it would be represented  as a reactionarystep running counter to the current of a great world movement.  Before taking sucha step we felt bound to examine every alternative course, in order to discover whichwill produce the best results and involve  the least risk.  In this  respect we havereceived valuable assistance from the Governments of  the Dominions.    6.  Before setting forth the various courses open to us, it will  be convenient  toconsider what our own &quot; vital interests &quot; are.  In  Sir Cecil Hursfs memorandum,which was referred to us by the Cabinet (Paper No.  B.R. 40), they are described as  the maintenance of our belligerent rights at  sea, which  it has always beenconsidered  unsafe to submit to an international tribunal, and our &quot; special interests &quot;in certain countries, due to  the necessity of maintaining the safety of our imperial communications.  This definition  may  (or may not) be correct  to-day.   It is,however, impossible to foresee where &quot; vital interests &quot; may arise in the future.  Inthe days of sailing-ships, who could have foreseen the vital importance of coal andthen oil?  Even ten or twelve years  ago who could  have foreseen the importance  ofthe countries of the Middle East to our imperial air communications?  Who, to-day,would venture  to forecast what &quot; vital interests &quot; may  arise out  of developments
in such directions, for example, as aviation, wireless telegraphy, Antarctic discovery,or some new source of power ?  We return to this aspect of the question in examining the detailed proposals submitted to. us.                 Existing  Arbitration and Conciliation Treaties.    7.  In view of the fact that the Arbitration Treaty with the United States isthe first to expire, and in  addition  presents greater difficulties than any other, wehave concentrated our  attention first on the attitude we should adopt in regard toits renewal, leaving  for later examination  the renewal of the other  Treaties.    8.  As a preliminary  to the study of this question, it is necessary to have inmind the extent of our commitments to  America in the matter of Arbitration and conciliation.    9.  It is convenient to mention first (though it  is the latest Treaty in  point oftime) the Kellogg Pact, a general Treaty, to which all the nations of the world havealready expressed their intention to adhere, except  Argentina and Brazil.  TheKellogg Pact condemns recourse to war for the solution of international contro-versies, renounces it as an instrument of national policy  in the relations of nations with  one  another, and  provides that the solution  of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be,  which may arise between them,shall  never be sought except by pacific means.    10.  Second comes the Root-Bryce Arbitration Treaty, ratified on the 4th June,1908, which  has now expired and the renewal of which  is under consideration.    11.  Third  comes  the   Bryan  (Conciliation)  Treaty,   ratified   on  the10th December, 1914.  The main provisions of this Treaty are that all disputes ofevery nature whatsoever, settlement of  which is not provided  for, and,  in  fact,achieved under existing agreements, shall,  when diplomatic methods  have failed,be referred for investigation and report to a Permanent International Commission,and the Contracting Parties agree not to declare war or begin hostilities during the investigation or before the report is submitted  The International  Commission hasto be composed of five members, one chosen from each country by the Governmentthereof,  one by each Government   from a  third country, the fifth by  agreementbetween the two Governments from some other country.  Special provision is madefor representation of the Dominions in cases affecting them, and there is a stipula-tion that the Report of the  Commission shall be completed within a year of beginningwork, unless the time is extended by mutual agreement.  The Contracting Partiesreserve the right to act  independently on the subject-matter of the dispute after thereport of the Commission  has been  submitted.     12.  In addition to the above  provisions,  there are, of course, available thePermanent Court of International Justice and the Permanent Court of Arbitration,established at The Hague by the Convention of the 18th October, 1907.                   Proposal to  Avoid an Arbitration Treaty.     13.  One proposal, which was submitted by the First Lord of the Admiralty and supported by the nigh authority of Lord Balfoiir (who, unfortunately, was prevented by indisposition from taking any active  share in this part of our enquiry), was thatthe Kellogg Pact (assuming that it will be ratified) renders unnecessary the renewal of the Root-Bryce Arbitration  Treaty.  In  support of this thesis it is pointed outthat the Kellogg Pact rules out war and provides for the settlement of conflicts bypacific means; that  ample pacific means are available, whether for conciliation orarbitration,  in the Bryan  Treaty and The Hague Courts; that the elastic plan of leaving to the occasion the precise machinery to be adopted is the  better one; thatthe attempt  to bring these disputes beforehand within hard and fast provisions of legal procedure is a mistake; and, above  all, that by  avoiding renewal all  thesedelicate matters of &apos;&apos; belligerent rights &apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; special interests &apos;&apos; to which we havealluded would be avoided.     14.  Attractive as this proposal is at first sight, we do not feel able to recommend it for adoption.  Under existing conditions  resort to arbitration is  still in  form, aswell as in  substance, discretionary,  and Mr. Kellogg has intimated in conversationthat he regards the Pact as stating a principle and. the separate Treaties as a means
of implementing it.  The  fact that war has been renounced  as  an instrument ofnational policy  makes it all the more important to find some peaceful means of settling an international dispute.  The majority of the Sub-Committee think it wouldbe difficult to resist the  pressure at home and  abroad which  would result from a refusal to conclude a separate Treaty.  We have therefore examined the Americandraft with the utmost care with a view to ascertaining how  far it will meet our requirements and what amendments are needed to render it acceptable.     15.  We are informed that,  judging by the experience of other countries, theUnited States Government would be unwilling to accept any considerable amendmentof their own draft.  We  have, therefore, aimed at making these amendments as fewas possible, and we consider that each amendment we propose must be one that would carry the support of public opinion here, and, if possible, in America.                        The United States Draft Treaty.     16.  The first American draft of  a Treaty of Arbitration to replace the Root-Bryce  Treaty was forwarded by Mr. Kellogg on the 29th December, 1927  (CP. 22(28)),  but was superseded by a later  draft  forwarded  on the 20th March,  1928.*The main provisions of  the  latter draft are contained in Articles 1 and 2, whichare as follows :                                   &quot; ARTICLE 1.         &quot; All differences relating  to international  matters  in  which  the high     contracting parties  are  concerned by virtue of a claim of right made by one    against the other under treaty or  otherwise, which it has  not been possible     to adjust by diplomacy,  which have not been adjusted as  a result  of reference     to the Permanent International Commission constituted pursuant to the treaty     signed at Washington on the 15th September, 1914, and  which are justiciable     in their  nature by reason of being susceptible of decision by the  application     of the principles of law or equity, shall be submitted to the  Permanent Court    of Arbitration established at The  Hague by the convention of the 18th October,     1907, or  to  some other competent  tribunal, as shall be decided in each case by     special agreement, which special  agreement shall provide for the organisation     of such tribunal, if necessary, define its powers, state the  question  or questions     at issue,  arid settle the terms of reference.         The special agreement in each case shall be made on the part of the United     States of America by the President of the United States of America, by and    with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, and on the part of the British     Empire in accordance with the constitutional laws of the  British Empire.  His    Majesty&apos;s Government reserving the right before concluding a special agreement     in any matter affecting the interests of a self-governing Dominion of the British     Empire to obtain the concurrence therein of the Government of that Dominion.                                  ARTICLE 2.         The provisions of this treaty  shall not be invoked in respect of any dispute    the subject-matter of which     (a.)  Is within the  domestic jurisdiction of either of the  high  contracting          parties.    (b.)  Involves the interests of third parties.    (c.) Depends  upon  or involves the maintenance of  the  traditional  attitude          of the United States concerning American questions, commonly described          as  the Monroe doctrine.     (d.)  Depends  upon or involves observance of the obligations  of  the British          Empire in accordance with  the Covenant of the League of Nations.&quot;    Article  3 provides that the Treaty shall  remain  in  force  unless  and untilterminated by one year&apos;s written notice given by one contracting party to the other.    17.  Before coming to the larger question of  policy involved  in the acceptanceof this draft,  there is an important alteration in a matter of  detail which we recom-     * Reproduced in fill 1 at the end of this Report, in parallel columns with iur iecomniendations.       [21628]                                                           c
mend should be made, namely, the omission of the words &quot; or equity &quot;  in line 8 ofArticle 1.  The Lord Chancellor considers that these words  are too ambiguous for inclusion in an international Treaty.    18.  As already mentioned (paragraph 4), the main difficulty in our acceptanceof this draft arises from the omission of any reference to &quot; vital interests.&quot;  In thisrespect the draft Treaty does not bear equally upon both parties.   Most, if not all,of the American &quot; vital interests &quot; are included in the Monroe doctrine, and are&apos;therefore reserved from the Treaty by Article 2  (c), but there is no correspondingreservation in the case of the British Empire. We have carefully considered variousmeans by which this deficiency can be made  good.                          Proposals by Sir  Cecil Hurst.    19.  One proposal, for which we are indebted to Sir Cecil Hurst, is that weshould proceed to reserve our &quot;vital interests &quot; by specific definition.   Worked outby Sir Cecil in Treaty shape this proposal takes the form of an additional articleinserted between Articles  1  and 2  of the American draft, and an amendment ofArticle 2 (c)  of that draft, as follows :     Proposed new Article 2.         The High Contracting Parties agree that as by the Treaty signed at  Paris    on the 27th August, 1928, they have renounced war as an  instrument of national    policy and cannot, therefore, become involved in war in future except in self-    defence  or in pursuance of obligations undertaken for the purpose of repelling    aggression and ensuring  international co-operation, disputes  which may arise    between them out of belligerent measures which either of  them may have been    obliged to take shall, whatever the nature of the dispute, only be submitted  to the    above-mentioned  Permanent International Commission.    Proposed amendment of Article 2 (c).         The provisions of this treaty shall not be invoked in respect of any dispute    the subject-matter of which.....         (c)  depends  upon or involves the maintenance of the  policy proclaimed in               the past by either  of  the  High Contracting  Parties in relation to               particular areas wherein such party possesses  special interests which               it is bound to uphold in the interests of the peace of the world.                      *X&quot;          &quot;)t*                      -fr    20.  We have already indicated, in paragraph 6, some of the general objectionsto any attempt to define our  &quot;vital interests.&quot;   In addition, we consider that the reservation  of the  question of belligerent rights,  as drafted in the proposed newArticle 2, though covered by an ingenious justification, would not be acceptable to the United States of America, and would  not provide an easily defensible ground for a failure to conclude a Treaty.  Further, some of us think it probable that the specific exclusion of belligerent rights would make it more difficult for us to refuseor avert an  International Conference on Belligerent  Rights  at  Sea.    We  have therefore rejected that part  of  Sir Cecil Hursfs proposal  which deals with the specific exception of belligerent rights.    21.  Subject to the insertion at the end of the proposed  Amendment to article  (c) of the  words &quot; its security &quot; in place of the words  &quot; the  peace of the world,&quot;we consider  that this amendment embodying what we  know  as the British monroe doctrine should be included in the Arbitration Treaty, and is justified  by the noteswe addressed to the American Government  in signing the Kellogg Pact.  We are,however, aware that this  doctrine, owing to its necessary  vagueness  in our  case,requires very delicate handling.   Proposal  to Except from Arbitration Subjects for which no Accepted Rule of                                   Law Exists.    22.  A second suggestion which has been made for our consideration is that weshould in Article 1 agree to apply  arbitration only in the case of  those differences which are justiciable  in their nature by reason of being susceptible of decision by theapplication of a recognised rule of  law.  This is designed to enable us to withhold
 from  compulsory  arbitration  the  question of  belligerent  rights  amongst  other questions  where  there is no  recognised  rule  of law.  Apart from the question whether it is desirable at all to withdraw belligerent rights from arbitration, which will be discussed in a moment, this proposal has in its favour that it is consistent with the  line we  have  taken in the past in refusing to accept the principle of compulsory arbitration.   Historically it is justified by what occurred in the case of the Venezuelan boundary dispute of 1897,* a case in which- Great  Britain might well have  been deprived of a considerable portion of the colony of British Guiana if we had been bound to arbitrate  under provisions  similar to those  of  the Kellogg draft Arbitration Treaty.  We note also that this proposal is consistent with one of the general considerations which  the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa suggests as a basis of our policy, viz. :          &quot; V. That a State cannot  be accused  of unreasonableness if it  refuses to     submit to arbitration a case not covered by existing rules of international law or     when  these rules are vague or highly controversial . .  .     23.  On  the  other hand, in weighing the merits of this  proposal, we must obviously,  in the first place, bear in mind that the Americans might refuse it and the negotiations on the Arbitration Treaty come to an end.   In the second place,  it is right to mention that Sir Cecil Hurst criticises if  on  the ground that under it we could not  reserve belligerent rights  from arbitration without detriment to the  very basis on which we  justify their reservation.  He points out that our contention has always been that our Prize Courts, which are entirely independent of the executive, do, in fact, administer what we believe to be a rule of international law, and that, on this ground, we claim finality for their proceedings.  He argues, therefore, that if we were to reserve  such questions from arbitration on the ground that there is no rule of law, we should ipso facto destroy the basis of our  claim to the finality of our Prize Courts  and materially weaken our position.     24.  There is,  no doubt,  force  in this argument, but we are not  disposed to attach conclusive weight to it.  For our Prize Courts administer what we claim to be international law.   If we decline an arbitration on  the ground that some other countries do not recognise the same rules as ourselves it does not appear to us to forfeit our claim that the rules on which our Prize  Courts work are correct.    25.  There is, however, a further and even more important observation to be made on this  proposed amendment.   As has been indicated, its principal object is, under cover of the exemption of differences not subject to a recognised rule of  law,. to withdraw belligerent rights from arbitration. The members of the Committee, having carefully considered whether this object is in  the true interests of our country,. are divided in their opinion.  We  will revert to this  question directly.                   Proposal to Require Parliamentary Consent.    26.  A third  proposal for safeguarding our  &quot;vital  interests&quot; in the  new Arbitration Treaty is that we  should  amend Article 1  of the American draft so as&quot; to provide  that the special agreement in regard to the organisation, powers and terms of reference of each case referred to arbitration shall  be  subject to the approval of the Parliament of Great Britain  or of any Dominion  whose interests are affected, upon the analogy of the corresponding provision on the  American side providing for the advice  and consent of the Senate.    27.  As the American draft  stands, the contrast in the treatment of the  two. countries in this respect is startling, and, in fact, experience has taught us that the consent of  the Senate can never certainly be presumed.  Without anticipating that. the requirement of the consent of Parliament will be equally effective, this plan would ensure that, before we were committed to any particular arbitration, both houses of Parliament here, and, where they  are to be parties, the Parliaments of any of the Dominions, would have to be  consulted.   The hands  of  our negotiators  would be strengthened by the knowledge that  the agreement would have to be  acceptable notonly to the House of Commons, where the agreement might or might not be carried by using the  Parliamentary majority, but also  to  the House of Lords, which, as shown by  the rejection of the Declaration of. London, is  liable to  adopt a moreindependent attitude in these national questions.    - .      ...               K ...                                 * See Appendix I. &apos;                              1 &apos; &quot;
     28.   If it was made clear in the course of  the negotiations leading up to the signature of the Treaty that this Parliamentary consent was really intended to beused as a reserve power in extreme cases where the circumstances, in the opinion of responsible British authorities, obviously rendered a resort to arbitration inequitable,the safeguard would be of the greatest value.     29.   It is difficult to forecast what the attitude of the American Governmentwould be towards the  amendment now under consideration.  They  might ask why,in the case of this particular Treaty, we  insisted  on departing from the normalconstitutional procedure of approval by Crown prerogative alone.  Our reply wouldbe that the Treaty in  the form of Mr&apos; Kellogg&apos;s draft presented a one-sided effect which was not acceptable here;. that we were merely asserting in the Treaty a powrerwhich the Crown was always able to exercise,  and which, in  fact, is frequentlyexercised in the case of important Treaties  in  Great Britain, and, in the case of allTreaties in some of the Dominions; and that we intended to include  a corresponding provision in other arbitration treaties to be  concluded.     30.   Further, if we approach the  Government, of the United States with sucha proposal, a great deal will depend upon how our case is put.   In submitting it tothem we  should, of course,  highly commend the American draft as it affects theUnited States, we should dwell with approval upon the elastic  intervention of the senate, which we should assume would only be  used in extreme cases and on veryrare occasions,  and in this  spirit  we should suggest  that the only satisfactory arrangement would be to make the provisions of the  Article exactly  parallel on bothsides.                       Belligerent Rights  and the Treaty.     31.   The Arbitration Treaty which the majority of the Committee  are preparedto recommend for  the approval of the Committee of Imperial Defence  and theCabinet does not exclude Belligerent Rights from amongst the subjects to which, inthe last resort, arbitration could be claimed  by either party.  A substantial minority of the Committee,  however, do not accept this  solution and  make an alternative proposal that the Treaty should be signed subject only to  a formal  intimation thatBelligerent Rights are reserved from arbitration until agreement has  been reached as to what those rights are.   The First Sea Lord, speaking on  behalf  of the naval staff, demurs to the submission of Belligerent Rights  to compulsory arbitration under any condition.  His reasons are stated in full in Appendix II.  Sir Maurice Hankeyasks that his agreement with Sir Charles Madden may tie recorded.     32.   Before setting forth the  alternative theses  in detail it  is necessary to statethat on certain fundamental questions of principle the two sections of the Committeeare agreed. All are agreed in regretting that we cannot renew the Arbitration treaty in the old form, excluding vital interests.   With the exception of Lord Cushendun,who is in favour of wide concessions by this Country on Belligerent Rights, all are agreed that it is important to maintain these in the highest form that is possible-amatter that will be dealt with in detail in our main  Report.   The  difference thenarises not on the principle of maintaining - Belligerent Rights high, but on the best method of achieving that  end.  Those who support the method of concluding  an arbitration Treaty applicable to Belligerent Rights do so with reluctance and onlyto avoid what they regard as greater risks.   Those who oppose this do so because theyconsider that the risks of injuring our belligerent rights in the long run are greaterthan those involved in the alternative course that  they propose.   At best it is a choice of evils that the  Committee of Imperial Defence and the Cabinet have  to make.We proceed to state in detail the different views which have been laid before us.Proposals of the Majority.     33.  The majority of the Sub-Committee includes the Chairman (Lord Salisbury),the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the  Lord  Chancellor, the  President ofthe Board of Trade and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,  who thoughdiffering widely from his colleagues as to the desirable standard of belligerent rightssupports the majority  on this question. ,The arguments which have convinced themajority are as follows.     34.   In the first place they are satisfied that if Belligerent Rights are withdrawnfrom arbitration an International Conference will be called  together by the UnitedStates Qfi the subject of these rights, the invitation to which we must surely accept,
and that there will inevitably be a demand from nearly all the Powers participating in the Conference that these rights should be placed at a lower level than we could to-day obtain from a Court of Arbitration,  and that American public opinion will support this demand; ..and for  this reason,  that public opinion  is looking towardsFreedom of the Seas, whilst the finding of a  Court could not be at a lower level than is prescribed by the American Naval Instructions, and would probably be upon an even higher standard.  As will be  observed from the Report we are about to submiton  the  general question  of Belligerent Rights,  the Committee have carefully examined these Instructions with the result that they turn out to differ less from ourown than we have had reason to expect.  We have therefore not so much to fear fromarbitration upon the uncertain law as it stands as from being faced with the amendedlaw which American public opinion would demand at the Conference.    35.   We could, of course,  resist the demand, but, if we were to take  such  acourse whilst at the same time leaving the United States no ultimate appeal upon anybelligerent rights issue except  to  force, we should  not be supported by our own people.    36.   It is no doubt true that we might,  after signing an arbitration Treaty notexcluding belligerent rights from arbitration, still be invited to a Conference on thesubject of these rights, and certainly in that event, as in the former case, we couldnot afford to reject the invitation.   But in this case we need only accept on the under-standing that the subject-matter should be limited to the codifying or bringing intoharmony existing practice, and  we could refuse to attend any Conference which had as its object an alteration or amendment of the  law.   For having shown ourselves soamenable  as  to allow Belligerent  Rights  to  be arbitrable,  wTe  could  confidentlyanticipate support from public opinion, at any rate in England, in refusing to attend a Conference which  had as its object amendment outside the practice not only  ofEngland but of America herself.   In other  words, if belligerent rights are not to be controlled by arbitration, the case for their careful scrutiny and amendment uponthe plea of placing them upon an equitable basis is immensely strengthened.   If, onthe other hand, arbitration is admitted, all that can be required is that the law and practice should be made clear as they stand, and we have a strong case to refuse tomove from that position.   . In fact, our situation would be so strong that not onlycould we resist anything below the level of the American Instructions, but even in thesolution at the Conference of the ambiguous points that lie between ourselves and theUnited States we ought to do very well.   In the interests, indeed, of high belligerentrights, it may not unreasonably be contended  that the only way to secure  them  inthese negotiations and conferences is to avoid coalescing all neutral Powers against us by refusing to allow issues, which are so clearly justiciable as Belligerent Rights,to be subject to some form of arbitration.    37.  It must not be forgotten that Prize Courts,  in  deciding a  question  of belligerent Rights,  purport to  be  administering International Law.   To refuse toallow questions depending entirely upon International Law to be settled by impartialdecision will be represented as equivalent to an announcement to the world  that wedo not intend to be bound by International Law, but only by the standard of our ownnecessities.  This has often been alleged against us&apos; in the past, to give substanceto the charge by a refusal of arbitration will  go very far to provide the incentive-needed to make the citizens of the United States resolve to do their utmost to prevent us from ever  again  exercising the  rights we claim.   The truth must be faced thatwe shall be less able in  the  future than we were in the late war  to  enforceBelligerent Rights against United States commerce  beyond the limits permitted bythe United States.    If an&apos; Arbitration Treaty exists we can at least rely on theexercise of those rights which are recognised by their  own Prize Court decisions and naval Instructions; if there is no Arbitration Treaty, the United States may disputeeven this measure of liberty for our Navy, and might conceivably even claim for theircommerce that freedom of the seas which  a large section  of their public  opinionalready demand.  In the absence of an Arbitration Treaty, we should have no redressagainst such a claim.  In this view, the existence of an Arbitration Treaty, includingBelligerent Rights, is a  protection to rights  which we have no other means  of enforcing against the will of the United States.                i    38.  But  beyond  these points broadly the&apos; majority  are  convinced  that,  ifBelligerent Rights are excluded, the Arbitration Treaty will not be accepted by theAmerican Government at all and with the Treaty,  the whole structure of a new departure in cordial relations with that Country iri the near future would fall to
the ground.   On the other hand the signature of the Treaty would produce great advantages not only in the sphere of general policy, but even in respect of BelligerentRights themselves.   As regards general policy the conclusion of the Treaty would tend to ease the situation in the cruiser controversy by removing the argument, whichhas .been  used with so  much effect  during the debates in Congress,  that  a greatAmerican Navy is  required  in order  to prevent Great Britain, when engaged  inwar, from interfering with neutral trade.   The existence of the Treaty would clearlycut away this contention.   The  Secretary  of State for Foreign  Affairs  indeedbelieves that this would so far improve the situation that the President might evenrefrain  altogether  from  summoning  a Conference notwithstanding the  general attitude of the Senate.  However, that may be, even if a Conference were summoned,we would repeat what has already been  indicated  in paragraph  36,  namely,that we should be in a strong position to insist that the subject-matter should  belimited  to codification and that even that codification  should  fairly take  accountof the British side of the case.    39.   There is this further point.  If we were engaged in war and there were tobe an outcry against our exercise of Belligerent Rights, an American Government,being anxious not to break with us, would be in a better position to stand up  topopular pressure in favour  of drastic action if it  could remind the public thatarbitration  lay behind its diplomatic endeavour.   There  would  be no  risk  ofprecipitate executive action.   Indeed, far  from this, there can be nothing remotelyresembling precipitation in  the operation of the American  Arbitration  Treaty.First diplomacy must be tried.  After its  failure the nature of the  dispute may  be such that  resort can be had to the Bryan Conciliation Commission, which is allowed a year for its efforts.  Then  the &quot; agreement &quot; as to what is to  be arbitrated has tobe settled between the two Governments and approved by the Senate, and, if theCommittee&apos;s  proposals are adopted,  by the Parliaments of all parts of the Empireconcerned.  Then only is it referred to arbitration whether by the Permanent Courtof Arbitration established at  the Hague or some other competent tribunal, and, when that point has been reached, there is no reason why the result should be adverse to ourclaim.    40.   At this point  it must be said that, whatever the Cabinet decide upon thequestion which has divided the Committee, we cannot escape having  regard to the.Court of International  Arbitration.   If we are parties to an  arbitration  there is always  a  British  Judge  upon the  tribunal, and  his influence, indeed his  merepresence, is no inconsiderable guarantee of an equitable  decision.  But it should  beremembered that if we are not parties, even if we have  no arbitration treaty at alland are not technically amenable to the decisions of the Court, these decisions cannotfail to weigh with us.   The point of view  of the world opinion which would accept them and  the attitude of neutrals generally must react upon any inclination of oursto exercise Belligerent Rights in defiance of those decisions even though we may nothave recognised their validity.    41.  Finally, the amendment to which we have referred, under which the lastword as to the reference of a particular  issue to arbitration  would lie with the parliaments of Great Britain or her Dominions, as the case may be, is  of the essence of the proposed Treaty wmich the majority submit to the Committee of ImperialDefence and the Cabinet.   If it were true that, once the Arbitration Treaty is signedwithout the exclusion of Belligerent Rights, every issue in respect  of those rights,whatever  the circumstances of it, however  vital it may be, however  great our want of confidence  in the tribunal that will adjudicate,  must upon the  demand of theAmerican Government be compulsorily referred to  arbitration, the Cabinet mightwell shrink from such a conclusion.  But in these democratic days such  an  abdicationcannot be  defended.   The American Government do not attempt to  defend  it.

The minority  of the  Committee is composed of: the First Lord  of theAdmiralty, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Secretary of Statefor India.  They, too, are in favour of omitting from the Arbitration Treaty itself &apos;any qualification which j, overtly or covertly, would exclude belligerent rights from its &apos;purview.  But they would accompany the Treaty by a separate reservation declaring
that we cannot regard the Treaty as applying to cases arising out of the exercise of belligerent rights at sea pending agreement as to what those rights are, but intimatingour readiness  to enter upon the discussion of this whole question at an early date.Lord Balfour, who, to the great regret of all his colleagues, has, for reasons of health,as already mentioned, not been able to take any active part in  the discussions onarbitration,  has also expressed doubts in regard to the proposals of the majority.After  perusing the Minutes  of the Meeting  at  which the majority  scheme  was discussed, Lord Balfour expressed views which have been summarised by Sir HarryBatterbee, of the Dominions Office, in the following terms  :          &quot;Although he  had  always been  opposed to a conference if  it  could be    avoided, it might be preferable to obtain  a definite codification of belligerent    rights at a conference, provided that it did not fall appreciably below the United    States Naval  Instructions of 1917,  rather than to rely upon  arbitration.   If    arbitration were accepted, it might result in our losing the rights we needed by    the reference of disputes to The Hague in wars in which we took no part.  Ho    fully realised the extreme difficulty of the situation, but he hoped that before  any    decision were reached to allow belligerent rights to go to arbitration, every other    avenue  would be very fully explored.&quot;    43.  The  views of  Mr. Bridgeman, Mr.  Amery and  Lord Peel are  based on similar doubts.  They believe that to include Belligerent Rights among the questionsliable to compulsory arbitration is the beginning of concessions, which will afterwardsmake it difficult for any Government  to stand firm.  In time these rights will bewhittled away, not only in arbitrations to which we are a party, but in arbitrationsarising out of wars in which we are not engaged, the decisions of which will becomeestablished precedents.   The Permanent Court of International  Justice, the Courtthat would normally be appealed to by all Powers other than the United  States ofAmerica, consists of Judges elected from Spain, Italy, Brazil, Cuba, Great Britain,Switzerland, Holland, United States of America,  Denmark,  Japan, France. Whatprospect is  there,  the minority of the Committee ask, that  a Court so constitutedwould endorse a high level of maritime rights ?  As Mr. Malkin wrote in 1924 :-          &quot;It is very difficult for a Court composed of international lawyers, when    dealing with cases of this nature, to realise that what they have got to do is not    to apply the rules which they will find in text-books, based as they are entirely    on  the  experience&apos; of the  past, but to endeavour  to  discover what should be    regarded  as the applicable rules of international law in the circumstances of    the present.   If, for instance, a really serious attempt  had been made to  test    before an arbitral tribunal the validity of the decisions  of the American Prize    Courts  in the Civil War in relation to contraband and blockade, I think there    can be little doubt that these decisions would at that time have been condemned;    but  even  before the last  war there wras  almost general agreement  that  the    development of the old rules embodied in those decisions was sound.&quot;    44.  The  Minority hold that to entrust the  future employment of BelligerentRights to the decisions of some such tribunal as that described above would  be to runtoo great a risk. They point out that any nation, however small, will be able to bringus to arbitration.  The American Arbitration Treaty will  not stand alone. It  willprovide a  model which  will  have to  be followed in similar  Treaties with othercountries.  There is no doubt that the existence of Compulsory Arbitration treaties with Holland  and Denmark,  for example,  would have proved  an immeasurablehandicap during  the War to the exercise of Belligerent Rights, which, thoughcontrary to precedent, were  justified by  the circumstances  of the situation,   Thedecisions of arbitrations under the new Treaties will handicap us in future wars,since they will be binding for all time and in all wars.    45.  If the Minority feel the gravest anxiety  in regard to the risks involved inthe Majority  proposals,  they  are profoundly sceptical as  to the realisation of theadvantages  claimed  for them.  They do not believe that the great sacrifice we aremaking in submitting Belligerent Rights to arbitration  is going to produce  any permanent difference to our relations with the United States  of America.   Since thewar the  British Empire has made considerable concessions to American opinion -the abolition of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, the funding and regular service of the debt, the extension of  the  operations  of liquor prohibition vessels beyond  thethree-mile  limit.  During the same period France has adopted  a very  differentattitude.  She has always held firmly to her principles on matters of national defence in refusing to discuss land armaments at Washington, in  declining to  agree to the
                                      itsabolition of  submarines, or to  ratify the  Washington Convention  applying  tosubmarines the rules for the capture of merchant ships at sea.  In addition, she hasnot yet funded her debt.  Yet,  which nation is the more suspected, which the morerespected, in America?  Which is the more frequent object of attack in Congress?There is no ground, in the opinion of the Minority, to believe that one more greatconcession  is  going to change American  opinion or  to lead to any  permanentreduction in the American naval programme.    46.   The Minority do not  take the view that the Americans will  refrain fromsummoning a Conference on the subject of Belligerent Rights because we agree toinclude  that  subject within the scope of the Arbitration Treaty.  The americans will be just as aware as we are ourselves that the concession is made to force majeure,and it will not render them less anxious to compel further concessions.  Moreover,the fact that we have accepted  arbitration will make them the more anxious to clear up  the whole question of what is to be the law  and  practice of the future.  for similar reasons the Minority scout the idea that we shall in fact be able to  limit thediscussions to a so-called &quot;codification.&quot;  There is so much uncertainty that, at thebest, there is bound to be a certain amount of rewriting.  Much as the Minority, likethe Majority, regret a Conference, they believe it is necessary to face the fact thatwe are very likely to receive an  invitation, and that we cannot refuse it.  Their plan,therefore, is  frankly  based  on  a  recognition  of the  fact that a Conference is unavoidable.   If the Conference results in a code of international law acceptableboth to  the Americans and ourselves, then they would consent to  the  inclusion ofMaritime Belligerent  Rights within the scope of the Arbitration Treaty.  If theresults of the Conference are not acceptable to us, or are rejected by the AmericanSenate,  then  we remain free.   They do  not see that  the Americans  have any reasonable  ground  for objecting to our desire to have the  inclusion of belligerentrights postponed for a year or two until this question is cleared up.  By offering to conclude  an &quot;all-in&quot; Arbitration Treaty, subject to  the amendments proposedin this  Report  and subject to this  one temporary7 exception, we shall have  put ourselves right with our own public opinion. The delay will also  give us time fora. proper consultation with our  Dominions and India, which, in any event, we oughtto have  before we enter a Conference on Belligerent Rights.    47.   It is also contended, on  behalf  of the Minority, that their method  ofprocedure would retain  for us a larger measure  of initiative in dealing  with thewhole question.  The  reservation accompanying the Treaty of Arbitration would afford some opportunity for a dignified and  reasoned statement of the case for ourhistoric policy.  If the Senate refused to accept the Treaty because of the temporaryreservation, the onus of having caused a breakdown would clearly rest with them.The declaration of a willingness to enter a  conference, which would necessarily haveto accompany the reservation, would enable us both to declare that we could only doso after we  had discussed the matter  among  ourselves  at the next  ImperialConference, and to intimate that we regarded it as a Conference for the purpose ofcodifying and clearing up  and  not  of modifying or revolutionising the existingmaritime law.    48.   The Minority attach importance to the delay, which their proposals involve,in reaching a final  decision from another point of view.  They believe that the last few months of a  Government^  term  of office is an extraordinarily bad  time forannouncing a great concession to a foreign State.  The acute differences between members of the Committee are  bound to be  reflected outside, and at the present time they will be discussed in an atmosphere that is wholly unfavourable to the formationof a steady and balanced public opinion.                            Statement of the  issue.    49.   In conclusion, the alternative proposals between which the Committee ofImperial Defence  and the Cabinet  are asked to decide may be summed up  asfollows :                                Alternative  &quot;A.&quot;    The proposal of the majority of the Sub-Committee (Lord Salisbury, Sir Austen         Chamberlain,  Lord   Hailsham,  Sir  Philip  Cunliffe-Lister  and  Lord         Cushendun) that the American draft, as amended in the form given below,         should be accepted, and that Maritime  Belligerent Rights  should  not  be        excluded from the Arbitration Treaty.

                                Appendix No.  1.       Extract from an Historical Review by the Historical Adviser to the                            Foreign Office (B.R. 46).          *           *****     20.  Among the  frontier arbitrations,  one of  the most celebrated and  mostinstructive is the well-known conflict between Great Britain and Venezuela over the frontiers of British Guiana, and it is worth while putting the facts on record.  Theclaim advanced by the Venezuelan Government, based, as it was, on early documentsfixing the frontiers between the Dutch and the Spanish Colonies, was of such a naturethat it was quite conceivable that an arbitral award based purely on these documentswould have deprived Great Britain of a considerable portion ot the Colony over which she  had,  in fact,  exercised sovereignty for  many  years, and which was in theoccupation of  British settlers.  This, then, was in effect not merely a  frontier, but a territorial problem of  a large scope.   Just for this reason  the British Government,notwithstanding the insistence of the United States, always refused to allow the case to go to arbitration in such a form that the award might conceivably have deprivedthem of this territory.   They proposed to get over the difficulty by making out theinstructions to the arbitrator that fifty years&apos;  actual occupation should be considered as giving full  title.  At first, Mr.  Olney, the Secretary of  State at Washington,strongly opposed this  suggestion; eventually, however, after much correspondence,he withdrew his objection,  and,  in consequence, in the treaty of February  1897, bywhich  the reference to the arbitrators was formulated, a clause  was  includedproviding that      Adverse holding or prescription during a period of fifty years shall make a good        title.  The arbitrators may deem exclusive political control of a district, as        well as actual settlement thereof, sufficient to constitute adverse holding or        to make title  by prescription.     In this way, Lord Salisbury was successful in  that which he had  throughoutconsistently maintained,  that he could not  consent  to  the  risk  of  alienating, inconsequence of an arbitral award, districts which had long been regarded as british possesions. The reasons he gives for his action are instructive :      &apos;     The claim of Venezuela is so far-reaching that it brings into question interests        and  rights  which cannot  possibly  be disposed of by  an unrestricted        arbitration.  ...   It covers two-thirds of the Colony of British  Guiana; it        impeaches titles which have not been in question for many generations. . .  .        The view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government is that where the matter in issue is        of  great  importance and involves rights which belong to  a considerable        population and are deeply cherished by them, special precautions  against        any miscarriage of justice are required.     21.  For our purpose the essential thing is to note  that it was not  by arbitra-tion but by diplomacy that the  difference between the  British and  the american governments (which was much  more  serious  than that with  Venezuela  itself) was settled, for the difference had been not as to whether or not there should be arbitra-tion, but as to the limits and the scope of the arbitration.  Of  course, it  would bepossible to criticise Lord Salisbury&apos;s attitude  and to maintain that if, as is the case,international law recognises no time limitations  to claims and no right of  prescription-tion to occupy territory, this is a grave omission which should be  rectified.  Butsurely  at the present time it would be impossible to  agree  on and impose a  general rule with regard to this question, and every legal  decision by a court must have init some element of a general rule.   We may eventually come to  a state of thingswhere such a general rule may be agreed on;  at present all that can be heped is thatin an individual case a definite period can be  arrived at, but this period must be onewhich  quite clearly in no way constitutes a binding precedent, and for  this reason it is better that it should be reached by agreement  between  the parties concerned and not be included in the  questions  referred to the  arbitrator. (12)    (12)  The point may be not without importance with regard to such&apos;matters as the Argentine claims tothe Falkland lslauds and the  Persian claim to Bahrein
    22.  In  regard to boundary  questions as well as to private  claims, we seem,then, to get to a positive conclusion.  Arbitration has established itself as having avery definite  and. positive value, but its application is strictly limited.   It has notbeen applied  in the past to the great territorial problems by which States,have been divided and which in some cases have led to war; these are settled either by war orby diplomacy;  in both cases the decision is incorporated in a treaty.  Arbitrationis used  only  in  minor matters when  difficulties  arise  in the  application orinterpretation of the treaty in fixing the boundaries.          *           *          *           *           *          *                                Appendix No.  2.  Remarks by the First Sea Lord on the Proposal to allow Belligerent Rights to        go to Arbitration if International Maritime Law becomes Codified.     THE Minority Report in paragraph 46 contains suggestions of a willingness toarbitrate on Belligerent Rights if an International Maritime Conference  produces a code of law.     I  strongly recommend  that such ideas be deleted.     2.  No code can really be produced which can foresee the contingencies of wartwenty, thirty or fifty years hence.     The Declaration of London in 1909 and the war  in 1914 made manifest the impossibility of such foresight even for so short a period  as five years ahead.   Hadour Belligerent Rights  been admitted as subject to arbitration in 1909 following onthe Declaration of London, we should have been taken to  arbitration  by neutrals in1914, and then deprived of our principal weapons for exercising economic pressure,thereby materially prolonging the war.     3.  A code of law lays down technical legal rules to give effect to  the  principles,which are the essence of these rights.  Just as development in municipal law must come with time, so also must this be so with other law.   Unfortunately, developmentof belligerent rights only materialises with war, when  it is too late  to revise rules for the guidance of arbitrators, who must presumably,  therefore,  abide  by what is then probably  obsolete, and insufficient to safeguard the vital  principles at stake,and any modern applications of these principles.     4.  If we must  attend a  Conference  to  discuss  with many  other  Powerscodification of maritime rights, is it not  better to go there unfettered by the know-ledge that the  compromise arrived at, which is the most that can  be  expected, willperhaps subsequently be the subject  of  arbitration?   If this  is not so,  will  notcontentious details be fought out to the detriment of good relations?     5.  Further, if the principle that belligerent rights can be arbitrated  on isconceded by the great maritime Powers,  may not pressure be brought to eliminatebelligerent rights from reservation under the optional clause of the Statute of thePermanent Court?     6.  I  view with the gravest  misgivings from the point of view of the naval officer  the idea of  arbitration,  particularly as  I  feel convinced  that  a bodyconstituted like the Permanent Court of International Justice would give an adversedecision on the following issues that arose in the Great War, and may be important in another war         Retaliation.        Continuous voyage in relation to conditional contraband.        Diversion.        Inclusion of many articles in the list of absolute contraband.        Examination of mails.        Convey.        Mining.        Angary.     7.  Such decision  may  be given by such a body largely constituted  of biassedneutrals in the early stages of a long war, and even pending the arbitral decision, theCourt or the Neutral will ask us to stop the practice complained of,  and the Navywill almost certainly be instructed accordingly.     8.  As I see it, our sea power will be stultified.     Admiralty, S.W.X, February 9, 1929.
                                Appendix No. 3.               Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion A if airs.     I WAS asked by the Committee to make  reference, by way of addendum to this Report, to certain points arising out of the correspondence with the Dominions which he somewhat outside the general principles with  which this Report is  mainly concerned.     1.  Our proposals have, of course, been  based on the  assumption  that  the application of any new Treaty will be Empire-wide, i.e., that all the Dominions and India will be co-signatories with the United  Kingdom.  While, however, the other Dominions have indicated their willingness to participate in the Treaty, some doubt has arisen as to the intentions of the Irish Free State.  No reply has been received from the Free State Government to requests for an expression of their views on the United States draft, but in a recent despatch they have declined to associate them- selves with His  Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom  in the proposed temporary renewal of arbitration  treaties with France, Italy  and Spain, and have announced their  intention of negotiating separate  arbitration treaties with those countries.  It is to be hoped that on further consideration they will  recede from this attitude, or at least refrain from adopting a similar policy in the case of the United States of America, but if they should insist in the latter case also on the negotiation of a separate  treaty,  the draft Treaty  proposed in  this  Report  will  require re-examination.     2.  The Prime Minister of  Canada, while intimating that  Canada is prepared, should occasion arise, to make use of the means of conciliation provided by the Bryan Treaty of 1914.has  suggested as an alternative that consideration  should  be given to the desirability of adapting to the purposes of the Bryan Treaty  the organisation and methods of the International Joint Commission created by the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 between Canada and the United States.  This suggestion is outside the scope of the present Report and would,  I  think, best merit  investigation  in connection with any general proposals for the  revision of the Bryan  Treaty.     3.  General  Hertzog has  proposed  inter  alia the  addition of  a  separate subsection to Article 2 of the draft Treaty to the effect that the question whether any  dispute falls within any of the categories set forth in the article as it now stands shall, at the request of either of the High Contracting Parties, be submitted to arbitration in the manner provided for in the Treaty.   I am of opinion, and I think the Committee were also  of this view, that the acceptance of this  proposal would give rise  to very great difficulties; in  particular, it would  render  liable  to arbitration the question  whether  the  subject-matter of any particular  dispute  is or is not a matter of domestic jurisdiction.    4.  Mr. Bruce, in his comments on the United States draft, raised the question whether it w^ould not be well to insert a reservation excluding matters which &apos;&apos; depend upon or involve any questions affecting the  relations  of the various parts  of the British Empire inter se or of any parts of the  British Empire, with regions in which the British Empire,  according  to its traditional attitude, has special interests.&quot; The latter part of this suggested reservation  is now covered by Article 2 (c) of the draft Treaty attached to this report.  The first part has been  carefully examined,both in the Dominions Office and the Foreign Office,  and though  there might  be certain advantages in reserving from arbitration all questions affecting the relations of the various parts of the British Empire inter se, I have reached the conclusion,  inwhich I understand the Lord Chancellor concurs, that (subject to  developments  in connection with the point referred to at (1) in this note) the arguments in favour  of such a reservation are outweighed by those against it.    5.  It may be noted that the phraseology  of the Bryan Treaty of 1914 is not  in conformity with modern constitutional requirements.  This has already been pointedout by Canada.

Werealise the force of the difficulty.....as to accepting  arbi-tration in  existing chaotic  stateof  international  law  in   this field.    It   would,   therefoi-e,appear desirable to  consider thepossibility  of  working  out  aninternational  agreement   as  tocodification  of  maritime  law intime  of  war.   Another  possibleapproach  to   solution  of  thedifficulty  may  be found  in thefact that the former conceptionsof  rights,  alike  of  belligerentsand neutrals,  are being modified by differentiation between privatewars and operations carried onin co-operation with other Statesagainst an aggressor State whichhad  violated  the  provisions ofthe  Covenant or of the KelloggPact.   Resolution  in  the  lastCongress  and  widespread  dis-cussion  in the  United   Statesindicate  the growth of feeling inthat  country   that  full  exerciseof  neutral rights  should not be demanded  in  relation   to  abelligerent    defending    itselfagainst   an   aggressor.    this tendency has  not  yet  definitelycrystallised, and the difficulty inany  case of obtaining objectivetests  of  aggression  must  berecognised.   It  appears,  how-ever,  to warrant  considerationalong  with   consideration   ofadvisability of seeking  codifica-tion.  We recognise  that the question  is  one  both of  great importance and of great diffi-culty.         AUSTRALIA.would  be acting in self-defence.The  question  that  thus  appearsto need settlement  is one whichit  is difficult to  meet by specificexclusion of  certain classes  of disputes, including that of rights.It is  this  consideration whichhas   led  the  commonwealth government to think that a solu-tion can possibly best be found by laying  down   a  clear  lineof  demarcation  in  the  treaty between   disputes   which   aresusceptible  of  settlement   by arbitration according to the rule of law recognised by both partiesor by principles agreed  to be-tween  them, and those disputesfor settlement of which no  suchrule exists or  can be agreed to.   The  Bryan  Treaty  alreadysets  up  machinery for  dealingwith   this   second   class  of disputes,   and  it   is  by   thecommission provided for in that treaty that  questions of  vitalinterest,   including   that    of belligerent rights if they cannotbe settled by diplomatic methods,could  probably  best be   dealtwith.     The    commonwealth government  feel   some   diffi-dence  in  proposing a  formula which would  meet  the foregoingdifficulty, but they  would suggest to His Majesty&apos;s Government inGreat  Britain whether  it  couldnot    be   met   by   redraftingArticles  1 and  2  of the UnitedStates draft  treaty  (i.e.,  theoriginal  draft)  along the  lines indicated above.  As  regards distinct Canadianquestions,    it   is   considered essential to  retain and  develop the procedure  of  the BoundaryWaters  Treaty   of   1909  for conciliation   and   arbitrationunder  Articles 9 and 10,  which provide for  reference to  Inter-national Joint  Commission  of     General Remarks.

ANNEX  2.REVISED Minutes of the Twenty-Second Meeting of the Foreign Office Committee    on Disarmament and Arbitration, held at the Foreign Office on Tuesday, July 15    1930.                                   Present:             Lord Cecil (Chairman).          Sir  W. Malkin.             Mr. Dalton.                     Mr. Cadogan.             Mr. Noel Baker.                 Mr. Howard Smith.                        The following were also present :             Mr. Craigie.                     Mr. Thompson.    THE Committee had before it paper DA. 41, on the question of the AmericanArbitration Treaty.    Lord Cecil pointed out that the Committee had been requested by the Secretaryof State to make recommendations to  him as to  the line which  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom should take at the Imperial Conference.    Lord Cecil observed that there seemed to be general agreement that it would bea mistake for ourselves to raise  directly the question of the Arbitration Treaty with america, but that we ought to make up our minds as to what our policy should he ifit became impossible  to avoid it.    Mr. Craigie said that, from the political point of view, so far as Anglo-american relations were concerned, it was not desirable at  the moment to raise the question.    Mr. Dalton agreed, more especially in view of the delay which had occurred overthe discussion of the General Act  with the Dominion Governments.  If,  as  nowunfortunately seemed possible,  agreement were  not  reached in September with theDominion Governments on the  General Act, he was afraid that if the question ofthe Anglo-American Treaty were raised in October at the Imperial Conference, there might be more difficulty in persuading the Government of the  Dominions to accede to the General Act in our formula.    Mr. Craigie, referring to his previous remark, explained that he would not liketo say that the Americans themselves would not raise the question  of the arbitration treaty once the Naval Treaty was out of the way.  Mr. Marriner had informed him that the American Government would not press the matter, but indicated that  theywere anxious to have a treaty sooner or later, and His Majesty&apos;s Government would eventually have to make up their minds on the subject. The late Government in thiscountry had thought it would  be  very  difficult to  reach any agreement with  theDominion Governments except at a conference.  If we were to let the next ImperialConference go by without raising the question, we might be missing the opportunityof reaching agreement.  On the last occasion when the United States Governmentapproached us on the subject, we replied that we were consulting the Dominions. Itwould be impossible to use that excuse any longer after the Imperial Conference had met, and it would be difficult for the Americans to understand why we should havelet the Conference go by without discussing the matter.    Lord Cecil said that what was important was to get the question of the general act settled  before the  Imperial Conference met.  Assuming that the General Actwas  out  of  the way, ought  we  not  to know what views we should  put before  theDominion Governments ?    Mr.  Dalton  enquired whether, that meant that, if the General Act were not outof the way, we should not raise  the American Arbitration Treaty at the Conference.    Lord Cecil indicated that he would prefer that in any case we should be able to announce a definite policy.    Mr.  Dalton observed that the chief difficulty consisted in what he might call thequestion of  parity, that is to say, were we to put in similar reservations to  balance the American reservations regarding the Monroe Doctrine and  the control  of  thecompromis by the Senate.
    Lord Cecil  said that he could not see the point of putting in a reservationregarding the British Monroe doctrine.  Our view was that it was of advantage tohave recourse as nyuch as possible to arbitration; if the Americans chose  to whittledown the area of arbitration, so much the.worse for them.  On the other hand, theirreservation regarding the compromis appeared to be much more serious.    Mr. Noel Baker suggested that the best procedure would be in the first place to invite the Americans to sign the Optional Clause.   If they refused to do that, wecould agree to a bilateral arbitration treaty;  they could attach to that treaty anyreservations that they liked, but we, for our part, would not wish to put  in similarreservations.    Mr.  Craigie observed that the American  Government would be unable to sign the Optional Clause as they would be unable to retain their-control of the compromis.He enquired whether, when  the  Americans  had  refused their signature  of  the optional Clause, it might not be possible, as a way  out of our difficulty,  to suggest to them something on the lines of the United States-Canadian Treaty.  He had reasonto think that something on those lines might appeal to President Hoover, though itmight not be so acceptable to the State Department.    Mr.  Dalton enquired whether it  would  not.  be  technically possible for  the americans to sign the Optional Clause with a  reservation retaining control of thecompromis.  But it was generally agreed that this would be most undesirable, asaffording a very  dangerous precedent.    Mr.  Craigie said that, from the political  point of view, there was no chance ofthe United States Government signing the Optional Clause at  present.    Lord Cecil agreed, but he thought that the invitation to them to do so would be good  procedure.   He  was inclined to think  that we might  accept the  AmericanMonroe doctrine reservation, though he wras more doubtful whether we should accept their  reservation regarding the compromis, and whether, so long as the Americanspersisted in that  reservation,  it would be worth  while pursuing the matter  anyfurther.    Mr.  Craigie observed that the only countries which had not signed arbitrationtreaties with the United States were Japan and Great Britain, and the japanese were doubtless waiting to see what the British Government would do about it.    Lord Cecil  said that if we were not prepared to say that we should refuse to sign a treaty to which the Americans attached their  compromis reservation, then the question would arise whether it  would be  better for us to put in a similarreservation ourselves.  If the Americans were allowed their reservation,  and if we did not  follow suit, this would lead to a one-sided arrangement, which might bedifficult to defend in Parliament.   It might be possible to  secure parity throughmaking a reservation providing for the necessity of agreement as to the terms of the arbitration.    Mr.  Dalton reverted to the idea of offering something on the lines of the UnitedStates-Canadian Treaty.    Mr.  Noel Baker pointed out that, if such  an offer were made, the United  states would reply by referring to the already existent Bryan Treaty  of Conciliation.    Mr.  Craigie explained that the advantage of the United States-Canadian treaty was that it would provide for a conciliation body, almost permanently in session, to-deal with small  disputes.  It also provided for an ultimate arbitral decision.    Lord  Cecil considered that it would  be  rather difficult when the  AmericanGovernment offered arbitration to  reply by suggesting a system of conciliation.  Weshould be in a different  position from all the other countries.  He  was inclined tothink that we should accept the Arbitration  Treaty.   But he thought it essentialthat we should in the first place have settled the question of the General Act.    It was generally agreed that that must be the first preliminary.    Mr. Cvaigie enquired whether, if the question of the General Act ha,d not been settled, we were not to seize the Imperial Conference of the American arbitration treaty question.                                        &apos;  &apos;**.   i  It was finally agreed that, although it would be preferable to leave the questionalone, it would  nevertheless be necessary  to mention it in any case to the Imperial

Differences which may arise of a legal nature or relating to  the interpretation of treaties existing between the two Contracting Parties and which it may not havebeen possible to settle by diplomacy,  shall be referred to the Permanent  Court ofArbitration  established  at The  Hague by the Convention of the 29th July, 1899,provided, nevertheless, that they do not affect the vital interests,  the independence,or the honour of  the  two Contracting States, and  do not concern the interests of third  Parties.                                  ARTICLE  2.    In each individual case the High Contracting Parties, before appealing to thePermanent Court of Arbitration, shall conclude a special Agreement defining clearly the matter in dispute, the scope of the powers of  the  Arbitrators, and the periodsto be  fixed for the formation of the Arbitral Tribunal and the several stages of theprocedure.   It is understood that such special agreements on the part of the  UnitedStates will be made by the President of the United  States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof; His Majesty&apos;s Government reserving the rightbefore concluding a special agreement  in any matter affecting  the interests of a self-governing Dominion of the British Empire to obtain the concurrence  thereinof the Government of that Dominion.    Such Agreements shall be binding only when confirmed by the two Governmentsby an Exchange of Notes.Conference.   The  procedure  would be to  suggest that we  should in reply to any-further advance made by the  United States Government, suggest that they should sign the Optional Clause.   If, as seemed likely, they refused to adopt this suggestion,we might have to accept the treaty as proposed by them, but without endeavouringto balance their reservation of the Monroe doctrine, and we should have to be satisfied with some such provision as they suggest with regard to agreement on the compromis,i.e., that the  agreement by the British nations should be given in accordance withtheir constitutions.     It was recognised that we should have to meet attack  on the ground that weshould thus be agreeing to arbitrate a dispute involving belligerent rights, with the sole safeguard of one condition regarding agreement on the compromis.
