(8.)-POLICY REGARDING OIL  CONCESSIONS  IN BRITISH                              TERRITORY.                        (C.I.D. Paper No. 1017-B.)    THE  COMMITTEE  had  under  consideration  a  memorandum  by   the petroleum Department, Board of Trade, regarding the entry of foreign capital forthe development of oil production in British territories.    THE PRIME MINISTER said this was a matter of policy which would require a Cabinet  decision.  Any remarks which the Departments might wish to raise onthe proposals contained in the Memorandum would best be raised on that occasion.He suggested that the memorandum should be referred to the Dominion representa-tives at the Imperial Conference for their consideration as soon as the policy to be pursued had been agreed upon by the Cabinet.    ME. ALEXANDER remarked that the Naval Staff considered it of importance that His Majesty&apos;s Government should  retain the right of pre-emption should waroccur.    MR.   GRAHAM   pointed  out that   provision  for  this  was  made in sub-paragraph 6 (g) of the Memorandum.                               CONCLUSIONS.    THE  COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed     (a) To refer the memorandum for decision to the Cabinet,  with a recommenda-          tion that there was no objection to the policy proposed from the point of          view of Imperial  Defence.    (b) To  recommend  that  the  memorandum  should  be  placed  before   the          representatives of the Dominions during the Imperial Conference for          their consideration.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.

THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OP  HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT.       Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   September 1930.SECRET.                                                      Copy No.    1171017-B.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.POLICY REGARDING  OIL  CONCESSIONS  IN BRITISH  TERRITORY.                           NOTE BY THE SECRETARY. .    THE following Memorandum on the Policy to be pursued  in regard to thecontrol of Companies holding oil concessions in British  territory  has been receivedfrom  the  Petroleum Department, Board of  Trade.  The  Memorandum has beenagreed to  by the Foreign Office, Dominions  Office, Colonial Office,  Admiralty,War  Office, Air  Ministry,  Board of  Trade  (Commercial  Relations and TreatiesDepartment), and these departments concur with the proposal of  the Secretary for-Mines that it should be submitted to the Committee of Imperial  Defence for  its consideration.                                          (Signed)      M.  P.  A. HANKEY.    2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W. 1,          September 16,  1930.                                ENCLOSURE.Introductory.    IN accordance with the general policy laid down in 1904, Oil Concessions onCrown Lands in the British Colonies and India have up to the present been grantedonly to Companies under British control.*  Regulations to secure this object havebeen adopted in all cases where there is any possibility of the commercial productionof petroleum, t    The question has from time to time  caused a good deal of controversy,  and hasrecently been revived through  the application of  foreign capital for admission inthe cases of the Island of Bahrein (in the Persian Gulf) and of British  Guiana.The United States Ambassador in London not long ago asked for a general statementof the policy of His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United Kingdom with regard tothe holding and operation of petroleum concessions by foreigners in territories suchas the Bahrein Islands; while in British Guiana the  discovery of oil indications ina boring for water has led to a demand on the part of local estate proprietors to leasetheir oil rights to United States interests.  In view of the importance of the  question as affecting the future of oil  supplies within the Empire,  an Inter-departmental conference was called by the Petroleum Department  at the request of the  ColonialOffice to consider the matter.   A meeting was held on the 7th May, 1929,  when itwas decided to prepare  a Memorandum setting out the views of the Departmentsconcerned for submission to the Committee of Imperial Defence.    NOTES. * This does not mean the entire exclusion of foreign capital.  It only means that the foreignholding- in the company must not be so large as to give substantial control of its policy.    f Canada has  allowed United States capital to operate through the medium of Canadian  registeredcompanies under the terms of reciprocal legislation.
    A note on the history of the British control policy, its present provisions, theattitude of other countries, and the views of the Government Departments and the oil Industry is attached as an  Appendix to the Memorandum.    A separate Memorandum  representing the views of the India Office  and theGovernment of India is circulated together with this report.Points for Consideration.    2.  In considering the question afresh in 1930  the following points might beborne in mind :     (a) The policy of  Restriction was introduced at a time when the Standard Oil           Company was predominant and anxious to find outlets for oil produced           in. the United States.  It was also feared that they would &quot; sit on &quot;           concessions in India and the West Indies so as to secure a monopoly for           oil produced in the United States.  The position is now changed, as the           United  States&apos; consumption of crude oil exceeds her native  production.           Though she might be  no longer unwilling to produce crude oil in the           West Indian Colonies, there remains the no less serious danger that her           wish might be to transfer it  to the United States in the form of crude           oil (if permitted) instead  of refining it on  the  spot.   United States           Companies are less likely  now  to  concern  themselves with restricting           production in Trinidad and India, as they have obtained a  large share           of  the much  more prolific  fields of Venezuela  and Colombia and  a           23 - 75 per cent, share  in the Iraq Petroleum Company.  Compared with           these large oil-fields, the output of British fields is negligible.    (b) British  companies are dependent almost exclusively on foreign sources of           supply.  If the restrictive policy followed by the British Empire were           adopted by the  United States, Russia, Holland,  Roumania,  Mexico,           Venezuela,  Colombia,   the   Argentine  and  other  Latin  American           Republics, the result would be disastrous to British Commercial interests.    (c) The policy, if modified,  should  only be  changed on a basis of  reciprocity,           i.e., we  should only let foreigners in in cases where they are citizens of           countries granting similar advantages to British nationals.  Admiralty           interests to  be  safeguarded  by retaining provisions for  erection  of           refineries, the employment of an adequate number of British subjects,           and the Governors right of pre-emption.    (d) The policy might be modified in one of three ways-:             (i)  Attempt to effect a clean  sweep&apos;of all restrictions. If approved, the                 adoption of such a policy might be suggested to  the Dominions                 and India.           (ii)  Remove restrictions against foreign capital in those parts of the                 Empire, such  as  the non-self-governing   Colonies, where the                 Crown owns the oil rights.   This action would go far to remove                 difficulties with other countries, but Trinidad mtist be included if                 the policy  is to  be effective.           (iii)  Partial  removal.  Each case to be treated on its merits and foreign                 capital allowed in places, such as Bahrein  and British Guiana,                 where British  capital  is proving  ineffective  in  securing  active                 development.Arguments for and against a Change of  Policy.    3.  The following arguments have  been advanced  in favour of retaining theBritish Control Clause in its present form :      (a) It is desirable on general grounds that the oil-fields  of the Empire should           be developed by British capital.    (b) It is necessary to take precautions not only to protect the fields in time of           war,  but  also during the period when war is imminent.  Control  of           financial policy and of management is the most effective safeguard against           sabotage or other hostile acts in time of strained relations.     (c) The policy adopted in India and Trinidad has been justified by the results.
        If oil enterprise is to be thrown open on a basis of reciprocity, it will be           difficult to decide what the unit is to be.  Is it to be the British Empire ?           If so, the laws of a single Dominion or Colony may prevent our getting           the benefit of reciprocity in the countries where it matters.        British Companies  tend  to buy British  plant.   United States  Companies.           buy plant  made in  the United  States.   The  point  is particularly           important at the present time in view of the efforts of the Government           to encourage export of British goods.        British Control includes the employment of a maximum of British technical           experts.   The United States are a long way ahead of us, and our training           schools have a  long way to go to catch them up.   Without the assured           future which British control provides for our men, they will be hopelessly           handicapped, and wre may give up the idea  of constituting a corps of           British technologists.        It seems  absurd to throw away our existing control  without securing any           corresponding advantage. If foreign capital is to  be allowed not merely           to participate in British oil enterprises as at  present, but also to control           them completely, we ought at least to secure a binding arrangement that           British capital will be  allowed in the foreign country  concerned.   At           present the participation of British capital in American oil  enterprises           depends on a law which may be altered at any time.    4.   The arguments that may be advanced against retaining the  British ControlClause in  its present form are :     (a)  It is  still generally desirable that British oil-fields should be developed by           British capital, but  it has already had a fair innings (some  of it a not           very remunerative one).  The only  important oil-producing fields at           present within the Empire are India  (1,236,595 tons in 1929), Trinidad           (1,245,000 tons), Sarawak (760,000 tons) and Canada (161,000 tons).   The           chances of finding great oil-fields are on the whole believed to be poor.           If foreigners like to come and spend money in searching  for oil, it seems           foolish to prevent them from  doing so.  If they are successful, the oil           position of the Empire will be strengthened.    (&amp;)  It has been suggested that foreigners are not  precluded  under existing           regulations from holding a minority  interest in  operating  companies.           This might conceivably  interest the foreign investor, but no  responsible           foreign oil company is likely to wish to participate on these terms.    (c)  The policy of Exclusion  has possibly served  a useful  purpose in the  past,           but is no longer necessary, and is actually harmful in so far as it prevents           foreign capital from assisting in the search for oil  in the Empire.   The           amount of serious oil exploration which is being conducted  in British           territory at present is painfully small.    id)  The present policy has tended to injure British interests in the United States           and South America, where United States influence  is powerful and may           spread to other countries. No country is really more interested than we           are in the maintenance of an open-door policy.    (e)  British Companies have now had time to get  on their feet, and  are strong           enough to resist foreign  competition.    if)  While supplies of oil remain undiscovered, they are of no use to anyone,           and will not be available in emergency.    ig)  The suggestion that individual  cases  should be settled on  their merits as           they occur gives rise  to  a difficulty in that  there  might be  charges of           discrimination, e.g., if Dutch Companies were admitted in one area and           United States Companies excluded from another; a general rule at  least           avoids trouble of this kind.    (A)  Even if foreigners  are allowed to hold concessions there is no reason why           stipulations as  to refining in British Territory, employment of a propor-           tion of British subjects,  the enforcement of effective working obligations           and pre-emption in emergency should not be maintained.    (i)  The tendency of British Companies to buy British plant is not very marked.           United States plant is frequently purchased because manufacturers in the           United States can make on such a big scale to meet the home demand that           they can  always supply  for export at low prices,  and have big stocks           available  to draw on at short notice.
     (j) Admission of foreign capital would not preclude stipulations for the employ-           ment of a given proportion of British personnel.  British  technical men           find their largest sphere of employment  where British Companies are           operating  in  foreign countries,  such  as  Persia,  Iraq,  Venezuela,           Mexico, &amp;c.     (k) The fear  of sabotage  in  the event  of  strained relations is  probably           ill-founded.  People  do not readily destroy their own property, nor is it           easy (as was shown in the case of the Roumanian oil-fields during the late           War) to inflict irreparable damage.Recommendations of Petroleum  Department.     5.  It seems that the balance of advantage now lies in the direction of admittingforeign capital within the Empire on more generous terms than has been the case inthe past.  At the same time, it is important that oil should continue to be producedas far as  possible by British enterprise, and that Defence considerations should be fully safeguarded.  Provisions can always be retained to  ensure  that a proportionof the oil obtained is refined  on British territory so as (a)  to produce a fuel oil which would be suitable to the Admiralty,* and  (b)  to meet  the  needs of theWar Office and Air Ministry  for petroleum spirit.  This can  be done  irrespective of whether the operating Companies are British controlled or  not.     6.  It is suggested, therefore, that the  present policy should be  modified toallow  foreign-controlled  Companies  to  operate,  but   only  on the  following conditions :      (a) Two years&apos; notice of a change of policy to be given so  that British capital           may have a final chance of securing concessions before the right is thrown           open to foreign countries.     (b) Terms of existing leases to be maintained  and their transfer  made subject,           as at present, to Government  approval.   (This  should be  a  sufficient           safeguard  against the  possibility of  foreign corporations  acquiring           control of existing fields.)     (c) Policy only to be changed on basis of reciprocity, i.e., foreign capital only to           be admitted in cases  where foreigners are citizens of countries granting           similar advantages to British nationals.     (d) Companies to be registered in British territory.     (e) Majority  of employees  and at least  some of the  Directors, including, if           possible, the local Managing Director, to be British subjects.     (/) At least 50 per  cent, of the oil obtained to be refined on British territory,           and the  plant  to  be  capable  of   producing  fuel  oil  suitable  for           Admiralty use.     (g) The Government to retain right of pre-emption in case of emergency.     (h) The clauses requiring that the concession shall in  fact  be worked should be           retained.     7.  It is submitted that a  policy  such as that outlined above would go far toremove the  difficulties encountered by British capital in obtaining  concessions inforeign countries, would make for increased and more rapid development of Empireoil supplies, and Avould  at the same time safeguard in the fullest possible measure the  interests of the fighting services  for supplies  of petroleum in time of war oremergency.     July  25, 1930.    * Cases may arise where owing- to physical properties of th9 oil this stipulation may have to be modified ; in such particular cases the onus of proof that the production of fuel oil to Admiralty specificationis not possible must rest with the concessionnaire.
                           APPENDIX  TO ENCLOSURE.History of Restrictions on Foreign Capital.     THE policy was adopted in its present form, at the instance of the Admiralty,with a view to securing supplies of oil fuel for the Navy and was introduced at atime when the Standard Oil Company was predominant and anxious to find outletsfor United States oil.  It was apparently feared that they would secure oil-bearingterritory and  keep it unworked in order to stifle competition with  United Stateshome supplies.  The fear of monopoly was particularly strong in India, where itwas considered  essential to guard the native consumer  against the possibility  ofUnited States companies securing control of the Burmah oilfields in order to  keepthe Indian market open for United States  kerosene.  The principles of the policy were worked out by a joint Admiralty  and Colonial Office Committee in  1904, andhave since been  incorporated in the laws of most of the  colonies and protectoratesbaving any legislation on the subject.     2.  At the  1918  Imperial War  Conference the  policy was pressed on theDominions by Lord Harcourt as Chairman of the Petroleum Policy Committee.     3.  About 1920-23 the British policy was brought into special prominence bythe attitude of the United States.  Public opinion in that country, fearing the rapidexhaustion of the United States&apos;  supplies,  clamoured  for a general &quot;open door&quot;policy and for retaliation against those countries which refused to adopt  it.  (Thisagitation was probably engineered in its early stages by United States  oil interestswho were apprehensive of being excluded  from Iraq.)  The chief step taken was theinclusion of a retaliatory clause in the Leasing Act of 1920 dealing with FederalLeases.  The  Senate twice  called for detailed reports on the attitude of foreigncountries, particularly  the  British Empire and Holland, towards  United States&apos;applicants for oil concessions.  The United States have since secured participation in  the Iraq  Petroleum Company,  and,  through discussions  with  the  dutch government, in the Djambi field of Sumatra.  The retaliatory measures adopted bythe  United States have also  influenced  the  legislation  of  South America.   (see section below  on attitude and policy of Other Countries.)     4.  The question came before the Inter-departmental Committee on Petroleumin June 1921, consisting of  representatives  of the Admiralty,  War Office, AirMinistry, Foreign Office, Colonial Office and Board of Trade.  From the discussionsbefore that Committee it transpired  that there was unanimity on four important points in favour of an open-door policy :    *(a) Regarded as a  purely commercial proposition,  the open-door policy would           be  advantageous in getting the most rapid and efficient development of           oil resources.     (b) This,  in its turn, would help  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  in  the United           Kingdom  in  making  the British Empire  less  dependent  on  foreign           supplies.     (c) Military and Naval requirements for physical  control in emergency could           be  safeguarded by taking possession of wells,  refineries and plant.     (d) Such  a policy would be of assistance from the diplomatic standpoint.     No decision was, however, come to by  the Committee and it was  left for theBoard of Trade  to put forward their views  in the form of a  memorandum.  It was recognised  that the British  Control Clauses could apply only to Crown Lands andthat  it was  not  possible to apply  the stipulations  to privately-owned  lands.Subsequently,  a  joint memorandum by the Petroleum Department  and  ColonialOffice (which  attempted  to summarise conflicting views,  but left  a decision open)was prepared for use at the Imperial Economic Conference in 1923, but the question was  not raised at the Conference and the matter dropped for the time  being.   NOTE. * This is only true if  adequate steps are  taken to ensure that leases granted are activelydeveloped.
                            British Control Clause.Reasons for Adoption.    5.  The two main grounds for the adoption of the policy of British control were as follows:     (a) strategic,  based on the undesirability of the  control of British oil-fields          being in foreign hands in time of war or strained relations;    (&amp;) economic,  particularly  the prevention of domination by  a foreign monopoly          and of the withholding of oil-bearing  land from development.Present Provisions of the British Control Clause.    6.  In its latest form, as used in Trinidad model oil leases, the British controlclause provides that     (a)  the lessee shall be and remain a British company registered in His Majesty&apos;s           dominions;    (&amp;)  the managing director and  the majority of other  directors, and  the local           manager and a proportion of the staff, shall be British subjects;    (c)  neither the lessee  company  nor the  premises comprised in the lease shall           at any time be directly  or indirectly controlled by foreigners.   (It is           usual to insist on the formation of a company to hold the lease and work           the concession, and to require the company to insert in its Memorandum           and Articles  of Association provisions to secure the above stipulation.           In theory, any proportion of foreign capital being less than one-half, and           so not giving control, is allowable under the clause.)    (d)  No change shall be  made in these provisions without the consent of the           Governor.    A further important  stipulation is normally made, i.e.,  that as soon as theoutput reaches a specified amount, local refinery facilities for at least 50 per cent, ofthe output shall be provided.  This  obligation has occasionally  been relaxed inTrinidad because ample refining facilities  already exist in the Island.Legislation in Force in British Territory.    7.  As  regards nationality restrictions,  the position may  be  summarised asfollows:  So  far as  can be  seen  from  an  examination of  existing  legislation,concessions for prospecting for petroleum on  Crown Lands can apparently be heldby foreigners in the following countries : United Kingdom.Canada.Australia   (except    Northern  Territory).New Zealand.Union of South Africa.Newfoundland.Kenya, Zanzibar.Federated Malay States.Straits Settlements.Johore.Jamaica.Barbados.Sarawak.Somaliland.British North Borneo.Provision for British  Control exists in  the following countries :-Australia (Northern Territory).India.Burma.Trinidad.British Guiana.British Honduras.Nigeria.Nyasaland.Gold Coast  Colony.Brunei.Papua.Fiji-Cayman Islands.    In  December  1929  the Queensland  State Government  passed  legislationpermitting the admission of foreign companies to search for oil  in that State.    In other parts of the British Empire the position is either doubtful or there is atpresent no legislation dealing with Petroleum concessions.  Territories administered under Mandate by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are precluded from discriminating against non-British nationals.
Lands to which the British Control Clause applies.     8.  ID Great Britain there are no restrictions on prospecting for petroleum byforeigners.     In India and the non-self-governing Colonies the British Control Clause onlyapplies to lands where minerals are the  property of the Crown.  In most of India,including the whole of Burma, the Crown owns the oil rights.  In Trinidad the mineral rights of the lands worked for oil are (a) privately owned by  those whoobtained their grants before 1902, but elsewhere  they are reserved to the Crowneither (&amp;) under  lands alienated after 1902, or (c) under lands  still  owned by theCrown.     9.  As  pointed out by Sir Thomas  Holland in  a  recent  report on the oil industry of Trinidad, these three types of lands are intricately mixed, and privatelands occur as scattered plots in the main oil-field.  The private owners of oil rightsare not restricted in any way, and many have disposed of their  land to  foreign aswell as to British Oil Companies, partly by sale and partly for working on a royaltybasis.  Roughly,  about a quarter of the  Trinidad oil-fields are privately owned.Trinidad is an exceptional case, but is important as representing the second largestBritish oil-fields.  So far as the West Indies, British Guiana and British Hondurasare concerned, the position is similar to that in Trinidad.     In other British possessions mineral rights are reserved to the  Crown, and thequestion of  private lands does not, therefore, arise.Attitude and Policy of other Countries.     10.  With the  exception of Japan, the Argentine  and Guatemala, the attitudeof other countries is, generally speaking, favourable to the entry of foreigners andthe participation of foreign capital in  oil development.   The United States have adopted a  reciprocal  formula.  Most countries have  their  own stipulations, andthe following is  a  short note on  the attitude of the oil-producing  countries.  no attempt has been made to deal with the legislation of countries which are not them-selves oil producing and control no productive territory  :      11.  United  States policy, as far as Federal Lands are concerned, is reciprocal.The Oil Leasing Act of 1920 (section 12) provides that  &quot; citizens  of another country the laws, customs and regulations of which deny similar or like privileges  to citizens or corporations of this country shall not by stock ownership, stock holding or stockcontrol, own any  interest  in any lease acquired under  the provisions of this Act.&quot;The bulk of the oil lands in the United States is, however,  in private  hands, to whichthe Act does not apply.  A similar policy of  reciprocity has been  adopted in thePhilippine Islands.     12.  Mexico. According  to  the  Constitution  of  1917,  only  Mexicans  orMexican companies have the right to obtain concessions  to develop mines, but thenation may grant the same right to foreigners provided they agree to be considered as Mexicans and not to invoke the protection of  their respective Governments inrespect of forfeiture or breach of the terms of their concessions.   In practice the mexican oil industry has been almost entirely developed by foreign capital, British,Dutch and United States operating through the medium of Mexican companies.     13.  Venezuela.-Foreigners  must  comply  with the  requirements  of  theCommercial Code providing for the registration in Venezuela of foreign companies,but foreigners generally enjoy in Venezuela the same civil  rights  as Venezuelansubjects.  Foreign  Governments or  States  cannot acquire  mining  claims or  beadmitted as partners in oil exploitation.     14.  Guatemala. In Guatemala leases for the acquisition of petroleum depositsmay be acquired  only  by native-born or naturalised  citizens, and are transferableonly by express authority of the Government and to citizens of the Republic.    By a commercial treaty  between the United Kingdom and Guatemala, signed onthe 22nd February,  1928, as a special exception  British Companies  registered ordomiciled in any part of British territory which does not accord reciprocal rights toGuatemalan subjects do not enjoy the benefits of the treaty in respect of  searchingfor and working petroleum in Guatemala.
     15.  Other Central and South American Countries. There appears to be atpresent no restriction directly discriminating against aliens in Costa Rica, Bolivia,Ecuador, Colombia or Peru, but in Venezuela, Colombia and Peru, three importantoil-producing countries, the existing law prohibits the grant, sale or transfer of a concession  to &quot; foreign Governments or States or corporations which depend on them,&quot; a provision which has created difficulties for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company,especially in  Colombia,  where legislation is  now in course  of revision.  In theArgentine oil lands have been to a large extent withdrawn from private ownership and reserved for State development.     16.  France. According to the Petroleum Law of 1922, oil can  only be workedby Government authorisation with the consent of  the landowner.  Authorisation isgiven by Government Decree, and it does not appear that the surface owner has anyclaims to the sub-soil. The French Government exercises discretionary powers in the granting of concessions in France and French Colonies, which makes discriminatoryaction possible, but there is no evidence of its operation against British Companies,in fact,  for some time, Messrs. Pearson  held  oil concessions in  Algeria.   It  isprobable that the French  policy  is  to regard all applications for concessions asmatters of public interest, and there  is reason to believe that alien companies would at least find it difficult  to  obtain concessions unless they formed part of a Frenchcompany.  The position is somewhat indefinite,  for, while a certain amount ofprospecting has taken  place,  oil  has  not,  so far, been discovered  in commercialquantity in  France or  the French Possessions, apart  from the small oil-field ofPechelbronn in Alsace, which is being worked by a French Company.    17.  Russia. The position  in Russia  is exceptional.  Prior to  the Revolutionforeigners and foreign capital were admitted freely for purposes of oil  development.At  the  present time all sources of mineral wealth are regarded  as the exclusiveproperty of the U.S.S.R. Concessions may be granted to foreigners by arrangement,but so far foreigners have been unable to obtain satisfactory terms.    18.  Roumania. A new law was promulgated on the 27th March, 1929, whichimposes no  restrictions on the amount of  foreign capital  to  be employed in themining  industry,  and  companies are  no longer obliged  to, acquire  Roumaniannationality in order to qualify for concessions on State Lands.  The previous mininglaw  of  1924 imposed restrictions  on  foreigners which  gave rise to  much dissatis-faction  among the oil companies.   The export of crude oil is prohibited. .     19.  Holland. According to the  mining laws of the Dutch East Indies and dutch Guiana, the development of petroleum is the right only of the Government or persons or  companies with whom contracts are entered into  by the  Government,i.e., Dutch subjects, inhabitants of the Netherlands or of the Dutch East Indies and companies  incorporated under Dutch laws.  The Royal Dutch-Shell  Group controls the bulk of the production, but United States companies have also  been  admitted,and, after  a long exchange of diplomatic correspondence and memoranda, Hollandwas  recognised   by the  State  Department  of   the  United   States  on  the17th September, 1928, as being a reciprocal country.  A Japanese Company now appears to have secured an oil concession in Borneo.     20.  Persia. Foreign capital has been admitted.   In the southern  provincesthe petroleum rights are held by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.     21.  Japan. -Article  5 of the Japanese Mining Law, promulgated on the7th March, 1905,  provides that &quot;  no person other than subjects  of the Empire orjuridical persons duly informed of the laws hereof are entitled to acquire miningrights.&quot;     It  is understood that this has been interpreted in a manner which makes itpractically  impossible for foreign companies to retain  or  transfer mining rightswithin the Japanese Empire.League of Nations Convention on Treatment of Foreigners.     22.  In conclusion, it is worth  noting that  the Economic Committee of theLeague of Nations issued a draft convention on the treatment of foreigners on the17th April, 1928.   It does not appear likely, however, to be of much practical effectso far  as petroleum development is concerned, for,  while Article 7 provides that
 nationals of the contracting parties shall be placed &quot; on terms of complete equality as regards the conduct of all commercial, industrial and financial operations, and, in general, any transactions of an economic character,&quot; Section 2 of the same article provides that each of the contracting parties retains the right to prohibit foreigners within its territory from engaging in ....  (d) &quot; the exploitation of minerals and hydraulic power.&quot; Present Vieivs of Government Departments.     23.   A Conference between the various Departments interested was held on the 7th May, 1929, to consider the question of British Nationality Restrictions, and, in particular, the cases of Bahrein and British Guiana.  The following Departments were represented :              Admiralty.             War Office.             Air Ministry.             Foreign Office.             Colonial Office.             India Office.             Board of Trade.             Petroleum Department.     It was explained by the representatives of the Colonial Office that,  in the viewof the then  Secretary of State for the Colonies, there were three considerations tobe borne in mind, which he put definitely in the following order of importance :      (a)  To secure the most rapid and efficient development of the oil resources of           Crown Colonies and Protectorates;     (&amp;)  To retain physical control of any oil or oil products that may result; and     (c)  As far as possible to use British capital and British enterprise.     24.  British Guiana. The Governor of British Guiana advised that there was every indication of an opportunity now for developing any oil resources there mightbe in British Guiana by means of United States capital, that the ban on United Statescapital prevented our having recourse to it, and that British capital appeared to bedisinclined to interest itself  in the matter.     25.  British oil interests appeared to be concentrating their attention on foreignterritory, and it was accordingly proposed to inform the Governor of British.Guianathat the restrictions hitherto imposed should be withdrawn.  It was agreed thatthe question of general policy could not be  altogether left out of account becausethe Secretary of State proposed to take action in British Guiana which was contraryto the general  principles laid down  for the operation of  concessions by Britishcontrolled companies  and might be used as a precedent elsewhere.    The ColonialOffice were ready to carry out any policy which might be  considered expedient tosecure that any oil won should be definitely under British control.   It was pointedout that, in time of emergency, supplies of oil in British territory could be takenpossession of by  the  British Government, and  it therefore appeared desirable inBritish  interests to increase them to the fullest extent, even if it could only be doneby foreign capital and enterprise.     26.  The representatives of the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry were disposed to  recommend that a policy of British Control should be retained on theground that any departure in the case of British Guiana might establish a precedent,.and that the existing policy had proved a success in the case  of Trinidad, and shouldn&apos;dt be abandoned lightly.  In their view, the restrictions should not be withdrawnuntil the position had been considered further in all its bearings.  They also urged the importance  of oil developed on British territory being refined on the spot, or, atany rate, within the British Empire, and that the Governors right of pre-emptionshould be retained.    27.   It was felt that, in the case of British Guiana, British&apos; Oil Companies had so far had but little opportunity of investigating the recently reported discovery of oil, and, at the suggestion of  the Admiralty, the Petroleum Department communicatedAvith three British Companies, who were furnished with   information as to  theconditions under  which concessions could be obtained.  One Company has sent out
a geologist, who reported unfavourably, and the other two companies decided to take no action in the matter.    28.  The Colonial Office have informed the Governor of British Guiana that only British Companies should be considered pending a decision on the general question of policy, and, in the meantime, the British Control Clause must be observed.The British Companies who were investigating the matter were, however, told thatit might not be possible to maintain this attitude indefinitely.    ,29.  Bahrein.- The Foreign Office stated that the United States Embassy werecontinually pressing for replies to the enquiries which they had made, not only as to.the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United Kingdom in the case of theparticular concession in Bahrein, but also as to the general policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in similar territories elsewhere.    30.  The general view of the conference was that, provided no serious objection was. raised by the Government of India, United States capital might be admitted inthe case of Bahrein, which differed from British Guiana in that it was not a BritishColony.  But, as regards general oil policy  in  territories  such as Bahrein, HisMajesty&apos;s Government must reserve the right to consider each case on its merits andis, therefore, unable to make  any statement of policy on  the  question such as theUnited States Embassy desires to obtain.    The India Office, after  consultation with the  Government of India,  haveexpressed their views  on the  question generally in a  separate memorandum whichis circulated as an Annexure to this Appendix.Views of the Oil Industry.    31.  The Petroleum Department have  ascertained  the  views of  the  mostinfluential of the oil companies operating both in British and foreign territory, viz.,the Anglo-Persian  Oil  Company, the  Anglo-Saxon Petroleum  Company  (ShellGroup) and the Trinidad Leaseholds, Limited, one of the largest companies operating in Trinidad.    (a) The  Anglo-Persian Oil  Company said that  their  company  had been  in          negotiation for oil concessions in the last four years in several countries   .&apos;.      in  South America. They did not consider  that Nationality Restrictions          in British  Crown  Colonies, or  the  British Control Clause, had been  a          source of embarrassment to them, either in their negotiations with the          Governments  concerned  or  with  concessionnaires.    The   particular           difficulties of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Latin American States          are that, in most of  them,  the existing law prohibits the grant, sale or          transfer of a concession to foreign Governments, or States or Corporations          which depend  on  them.  At the same time, the Chairman  (Sir John          Cadman) expressed the view that, on general grounds, the existing policy          of British  Nationality Restrictions  and  the British  Control Clause          called for revision having regard to the difficulties inevitably created with           interests in the United States and possibly elsewhere.               If  the restrictions served  a vital  or  even an important national          purpose, or were  necessary for the growth or  maintenance of a key          industry, as when they were first imposed, the whole question would bear          a different aspect.   In point of fact,  the oil production, actual and          potential, of  British Crown Colonies   is  inconsiderable, with  the sole          exception of Trinidad.  The total production of Trinidad is  small and          seems unlikely  to increase substantially.  British Oil  Companies are          firmly established there and efforts  by  United States  Companies to find           oil on extensive areas on private property recently leased  have had very           little success.   In any case the right of pre-emption of any  stocks  or           production in British territory for Government  purposes is secured by           international law and may be further  ensured by a special  pre-emption           clause in any lease. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company are of the opinion;           that the time  has come  when  restrictions  can  be  removed  without           prejudice to British  oil interests; that  it would be a  mistake to remove           the restrictions piecemeal;  but that it would be equitable to give British           oil interests reasonable notice of the change of policy  to enable them to           take up further areas of Crown lands  if they so desire.   The United           States&apos; Government should be advised that  His Majesty&apos;s Government in
      the United Kingdom  have decided to recommend local legislation to      remove the restrictions.  This  step would materially assist the British      Oil Industry in its negotiations, now pending, with United  States  oil      interests  for a comprehensive  adjustment of current problems both of      production and of distribution.(b) The A nglo-Saxon Petroleum Company are also in favour of modification of      the present policy and state that the companies of the Royal Dutch-Shell      Group have experienced many difficulties because of  the  non-recipro-      cating legislation  which obtains in certain  British  Colonies, but they      have, to some extent, been able to minimise these difficulties by reason of      their Dutch association.  They recommend that all restrictions  within the      British Empire should be removed as quickly as possible.  They state that      the Government of the United States is continually on the watch to prove      that the Royal Dutch-Shell Group or its subsidiaries are, in fact, British      controlled and, in consequence, are not entitled to hold any interest in      Federal oil lands.(c) Trinidad Leaseholds, Limited, said that in  Trinidad the British Control      Clause had in the past definitely operated to their advantage, and they      did not think that they had been handicapped by it in their negotiations      for concessions in Venezuela.  They had, however, come to the  conclusion      that on balance the advantages  of changing the  present policy would      probably outweigh the possible disadvantages of retaining it in  its present      form.  They urged first  that the waiving of the Clause should be made      dependent upon a  Reciprocity Agreement being  secured with foreign      Governments,  and secondly that,  where British  concerns were already      operating in a British Possession as in Trinidad, a period of notice, say      two years, should be given  before the change is brought  into effect.                            Annexure to Appendix.                                          India Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1,(E. and O. 7779/29.)                                       November 13, 1929.Sir,    WITH reference  to  recent inter-departmental  discussion of  the question of modifying the British Empire policy in regard to the grant of oil concessions to foreigners and foreign companies, I am directed by the Secretary of State  for indian Council to forward, for the information of the Secretary for Mines,  copy of aMemorandum on the grant of oil  concessions in  British India, which contains an expression of the views of the Secretary of State in Council formed after consultationwith the Government of India.    2.  This Memorandum has been prepared with a view to being  submitted to theCommittee of Imperial Defence or any other Committee that may  be instructed byHis Majesty&apos;s Government to consider the proposals made in the Petroleum Depart-menfs Memorandum.                                                I am, Sir,                                                     Your obedient Servant,                                               (Signed)       W. D.  CROFT.    The Secretary,        Petroleum Department,            Mines Department,                 Dean Stanley  Street, S.W. 1.        Memorandum on the Grant of Oil Concessions in British India.    The grant of mineral concessions in British India is governed by the  MinesRegulations (generally known as the Mining Rules);  these are prescribed by theSecretary of State for India in Council and apply only to such minerals as are the      [21693]                                                         D
property of Government.  (There are no restrictions on the acquisition of mineralconcessions in land the mineral rights of which are private property.)  The MiningRules were generally revised in 1913.  At that time minerals were divided into two classes, reserved  and unreserved (reserved minerals including petroleum), and itwas laid down that the right to prospect for reserved minerals should be exercisedonly by British subjects.  This prescription to all intents and purposes  restrictedthe grant of oil concessions  to British subjects.  Subsequently, further amendments-were  introduced  in the Mining Rules doing away with the  distinction betweenreserved and unreserved minerals and  laying down that     (a) A certificate of approval or a  prospecting licence or a mining lease may be           granted only to  a British subject or to  a company or firm controlled by           British subjects; -    (&amp;) A prospecting licence  cannot  be transferred except to a person  holding a           certificate of approval (and therefore a  British subject) and without the           previous sanction of the Local Government;    (c) A lease cannot be transferred  except to a person who holds a certificate of           approval (and is therefore a British subject) and without the previous           sanction of the Local Government.    These are the rules that are now in force; the prescriptions (&amp;) and (c)  above are enforced  by  suitable  conditions incorporated  in  the prospecting licences  and mining leases.    2.   The  policy of  excluding aliens from oil  concessions in India which areGovernment property  dates from many years ago.  The question was specificallyconsidered in 1902, when the Colonial Oil Company and the Anglo-American oil company, Limited, two  subsidiaries  of the  Standard Oil  Company of America,applied for certificates of approval with  a view  to obtaining  prospecting licences for oil in Burma.  Both applications were refused.   The reasons for refusal are contained in  paragraph 3 of the Revenue and Agriculture Despatch No. 70,  datedthe 23rd October, 1902, where it is stated that the Government of India had noobjection to American competition as such, and that their decision was  in no  wayinfluenced by the fact that the Company was an American one.   The reason forrefusal  was  to exclude  from  Burma the Standard  Oil Trust of America, the intentions of  which in entering the Burma oil-fields could only be regarded with the gravest suspicion. It was  believed that their object was to obtain a monopoly ofthe  oil  trade of Burma by underselling, absorbing  or superseding the existing companies, and,  having thus obtained control of the oil-fields, to treat the Burmaoil trade as entirely subservient to their much more important interests in other partsof the world.  It was anticipated that their  line of action would be to close downproduction in Burma, thus  stifling an important Indian industry and hampering thedevelopment  of the country.     3.  In 1904, at the instance of the Admiralty, the India Office suggested forthe consideration of the  Government of  India that, in order to ensure suitable supplies of fuel  oil for the Navy, oil-mining leases in India should in future  only be granted to companies which were British in organisation and  control, and that refining  should be conducted  on British  soil.  The  Government  of India replied that although in their despatch of October 1922 (referred to above) they had said that they  had no objection  to American competition as such,  but only to  the monopolist character of the Standard Oil  Company, the actual result of their policy in the past had  been that the two largest oil Associations in India, the  Burma Oil Company and the Assam Oil Company, were British in organisation and control, and foreign companies had in fact been excluded  from India.   The Government of India went on to say that, in their opinion, the  observance of this principle was demanded  in the interests of  the Indian consumer and of the British and Indian producers in India, as well as in the interest of His Majesty&apos;s Navy; they promised, therefore, to do  everything in their power to insist on its being acted on in  future and thought that this end could be achieved by  instructing Local Governments not to grant prospecting licences or mining leases, or to sanction transfers, to foreigners. On the 23rd March,  1905, instructions to this  effect were circulated to all Local Governments and Administrations.  Later on, as stated in  the first paragraph of this note, this prescription was embodied in the Mining Rules.
    4.  The present position thus is that, so far as the minerals owned by Govern-ments are concerned, no concession can be given or transferred to a person who isnot British, or to a Company, the control of which is not in British hands.    5.  The question  of  removing the  restrictions  on  the  acquisition of  oilconcessions by  foreigners was the subject of careful and  detailed consideration bythe Government of India in 1923, when it was anticipated that the general questionof oil policy might be raised at the Imperial Economic Conference.  After a very careful and thorough discussion of the arguments, both for and against the adoptionof the Open-door Policy, the conclusions then reached  by  the Government of india were that removal of the existing restrictions would not be beneficial to India andthat the reconsideration of their traditional policy would not be justified except for reasons of high policy affecting the interests of the Empire as a whole.   In  1924 the relatively high price of petrol in India led to a reconsideration of the  question ofthe desirability or  otherwise  of maintaining  the  Closed-door  Policy.   After a careful review of  the situation,  the Government of India decided to  let mattersstand as  they were.                                                -    6.  It may be said  that the traditional policy of  the Government  of  India isthe prevention  of a monopoly.  The Government of India realise that circumstances might arise in India which might possibly render the admission of outside interestsadvisable even  in India&apos;s own interests in order to prevent a monopoly  on  the partof a British concern, but they would not wish to make any such change unless it were clearly shown to be in Indian interests to do so,  and they are not of opinion thatthis could be shown at present.  The principle of  the Closed-door has been  followedfor many years with satisfactory results, and the Government of India are unwilling to go  back on a policy which has stood the test of time.    7.  The Government of India note that a  change in the closed-door Policy isadvocated in  British Guiana with a view to  attracting the  American capitalavailable for the development of its oil-fields.  Similar reasons cannot be advancedfor the  relaxation of the existing restrictions  in India,  as extensive  prospectingoperations  are already being carried out in various  parts of the country.   the chances of discovery of new important oil-fields are remote, if not beyond the boundsof possibility.    8.  The present views  of the Secretary  of State   for India,  formed  afterconsultation with the Government of India, are as follows : He is unable to acceptthe recommendations set out in the memorandum of July last  prepared by  the petroleum Department, and  accepts the view of the Government of India that anyproposal to make companies under foreign control eligible for oil concessions in theEmpire would be  detrimental  to Indian interests.  In this connection referencesmay be made to a recommendation of the External Capital Committee, 1925, whichwas appointed  by the Government of India &apos;&apos; to consider the question of the flow ofcapital  into  India from external sources.&quot;  The  Committee recommended that&apos;&apos; where  a  concession is granted to exploit  a wasting  asset,  such as a mineralconcession, no definite rules can be prescribed.  It must be a question in each  casewhether it is better from the point of view of the national interest that a concession should be developed  by external capital or left  until indigenous capital may beprepared  to  develop it.  Such  concessions  should only  be granted  to  externalcapitalists when it is clearly in the national interest that they should be developed.&quot;At the present time Indian capitalists are unable to compete on equal  terms withforeign capital in the exploitation of  oil-bearing lands for the reason that Indianbusiness  organisation is in  a  backward  stage  of development  as compared  with america and other foreign countries.  Accordingly, in  the next fewT years the entry into the field of foreigners with large resources might  prove detrimental to indian national  interests, since it might have the effect of leaving nothing for Indian capital to exploit when it is in a position to compete.    The Secretary of State also  considers that  it would be inopportune at present to consult the Indian Legislature regarding a modification of Indian oil policy onthe lines  suggested, and in any case thinks it unlikely that any proposal which wouldgive United States citizens new rights in land in India would be approved by theLegislature  so  long  as  Indians are  subject to disabilities  in the United States inrespect of citizenship and the holding of land in certain States.
    At the same time, the Secretary of State does not see any good reason why his desire  to maintain the present policy in India should be  regarded as a reason for maintaining it in British Guiana if on other grounds it is desired to make a changethere.   Some phrases in the Petroleum Departments memorandum appear to imply that if the policy were reversed in British Guiana, other parts of the Empire wouldbe under some sort of obligation to follow the precedent thereby created.  So far as india  is concerned,  the Secretary of State does not consider that  this would bethe case.India Office, November 1, 1929.o
