SECRET.                                                     Copy  No.   38CP. 334  (30).CABINET.SINGAPORE  BASE.Position of the Malayan and Hong Kong Governments.           MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.     1.   AS I am not myself a member of the Singapore Committee of the Imperial Conference, I propose in this Memorandum to mention, for the information of my colleagues, certain aspects of the future of the Base as it affects the Governments of the Straits Settlements, the Federated Malay States and Hong Kong.  These Govern- ments are intimately  concerned with the. question not only for obvious strategic reasons but also because of the  generous gifts&apos;which they made towards the cost of the- undertaking.  I therefore thought it  desirable in anticipation of the discussions at the Imperial Conference to request the Governor of the Straits Settlements  (who is also High Commissioner for the  Malay States) and the Governor of Hong Kong to advise me by telegram of their views on the matter.  It was made clear that no formal  consultation with local unofhcials should be undertaken, but that no doubt account would be taken of local opinion generally so far as it might be known.  The replies are printed as Appendices to this Memorandum.    2.   It will be seen that in the opinion of the  Governor of the Straits Settle- ments,  which has since been  endorsed by all the  members of the local Defence Committee, a fully protected  Naval Base, as  planned, would  be both a  safeguard and a valuable asset to Malaya, but that an unprotected or inadequately protected Naval Base would be a great danger to Malaya as an invitation to attack : a slowing- down process would prolong the period during which the Naval Base was a potential source of danger rather than a protection.  The view of the Governor of Hong Kong was that the completion and full protection  of the base at Singapore was essential to the defence of Hong Kong in the  event of war.  Due consideration will, no doubt, be given by the  experts to  these  views  of the question   as  regarded  from  the strategic standpoint.    3.  It is also necessary to  bear in mind that when the question of the sufficiency of the present docking accommodation at  Singapore was examined recently by the Imperial Shipping Committee, it was pronounced adequate  on the  supposition  that the naval dock would be to some extent available, in accordance with what was under- stood  to be Admiralty policy.   Docking accommodation at Singapore is not sufficient if the civil dock is liable to be  used for naval purposes, with, of course, priority for naval vessels, and the authorities in the Straits  Settlements cannot incur the expense of constructing a new dock without raising dock charges to an extent  likely to damage the port.    4.  As regards contributions to the cost  of the base,  it will  be necessary toexamine  the effect of abandonment or curtailment in relation to the conditions onwhich the gifts were offered :  (a) Gift of  250,000 by the Government of Hong Kong.    On  the 16th. December,  1924, the Governor of Hong Kong, with the approvalof the unofficial members of  the Executive and Legislative Councils,  offered to      [21813]                  &quot; JTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT.                  Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1930.
His Majesty&apos;s Government the sum of  250,000, representing in round figures theprofits of the control of local shipping during the war, &quot;as a contribution in aid ofthe Singapore Base.&quot;  The offer was gratefully accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment.   Payment was made in instalments, the final instalment  being received inMarch, 1927.     5.   While the offer was not made subject to any special condition, as in the caseof the Federated Malay States&apos; gift, it was definitely stated to be &quot;in aid of the singapore Base,&quot; and His Majesty&apos;s Government are under a manifest obligationto consult the Hong Kong Government as to the repayment  or otherwise of themoney in the event of a decision to abandon the construction of the Base.   It is not certain that the Hong Kong  Government would press for its repayment, but, at thesame time,  it will be seen from the Governors telegram of the  3rd  October* that failure to complete the Base  would probably be regarded as a breach of the impliedcondition of the gift.(b) Gift of Land by the Straits Settlements Government.     6.   On the 3rd May, 1923, the Governor  of the  Straits  Settlements  reportedthat, with  the concurrence  of  the Unofficial  Members  of  the Executive  and legislative Councils, the sites selected for the proposed Naval Base and Aerodromewould be handed over to His Majesty&apos;s Government as a free gift.  The Secretaryof  State approved the  offer,  which  was readily accepted by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.     7.   The land was  acquired at a cost of approximately  146,000, and is held under two  Trust Deeds for  the  Admiralty and Air  Ministry, respectively.  TheDeclaration of Trust in the case of the land held for the Admiralty provides that  if at any time the said portion of land or any part thereof shall cease to be  requiredfor the purpose of a Naval Base the said portion or such part thereof, as the case may be, shall stand freed and released from the trust hereby created and the colonial government may dispose of the same upon payment to the Lords Commissioners ofthe amount (if any) whereby the market value of the same, inclusive of all works,buildings   and   machinery  constructed   and   erected  thereon  by  the  lords commissioners  exceeds the  estimated value of the same exclusive of such works,buildings and machinery.&quot;   It is understood that the Declaration of Trust in thecase of the land held for the Air Ministry is in similar terms.     8.   It  is, therefore, clearly provided that, if the Base is now abandoned, the sites given by the Straits Settlements will revert  to the Colony.     9.   It will, however, be necessary to consider  what provision, if any, will requireto be made to reimburse the Colony for such loss as they may have incurred. At thetime of the  previous decision not to proceed  with  the Base, in March 1924,  the thenGovernor telegraphed that it was essential that he should  be authorised to state thatthe Imperial Government would reimburse the actual amount paid by the Colony, orthe difference between the sum and that which could be obtained by realienating theland.  He was informed, in reply, that he might announce that arrangements wouldbe proposed to Parliament by His Majesty&apos;s Government which would relieve theColonial  revenue of any burden  incurred through their generous gift, if  the land was ultimately not used for the purposes for  which it was presented. The net annual loss of interest on the cost of the land (apart from the initial cost of the acquisitionof the land) wTas estimated, in October 1924, as approximately  5,490 (47,057 dollars).     10.   If it is now decided to abandon the scheme  for the Base, I consider thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government will  be under a moral obligation to  repeat the under-taking given in 1924 and to offer to reimburse the Straits Settlements Governmentfor any loss incurred by them through their gift.(c) Gift of  2,000,000 by the Federated Malay  States.     11.   On the 23rd June,  1926, a resolution was passed by the Federated malay states Federal Council offering  to  contribute   2;000,000 sterling to facilitate theImperial Government in proceeding with the necessary portions of the scheme forthe Singapore Naval  Base as a wdiole.  The offer was gratefully accepted by HisMajesty&apos;s Government.* Appendix II.
* Appendix I.                                      3    12.  In a despatch, dated the 28th July, 1926, the High Commissioner for the malay States stated that the Crown Agents for the Colonies would be instructed toset aside out of the funds of the Federated Malay States Government in their hands,a special fund of  2,000,000, which would remain under the control of the federated malay States Government.  The sum of  400,000 would be paid each year from thisfund  to His Majesty&apos;s  Government  for  a period of five years, payment beingconditional upon the decision to proceed with work on the Base remaining unaltered.Up to date the  payment of  four instalments has been authorised,  amounting to 1,600,000.    13.  If it were now decided to abandon the scheme for the Base, it would clearly be necessary, after consultation with the High Commissioner, to offer to repay to the rulers of the Federated Malay States the instalments of their gift already paid.    14.  The High Commissioner has already made clear in his  telegram of the27th September* that, unless the Naval Base is completed and adequately protectedwithin a reasonable time, he considers that all contributions made by  Malaya to thescheme should be repaid in full, an opinion which he believes  to be generally heldin Malaya.    15.  To sum up, the Colonial Governments regard the completion of the Base aVessential to their safety.  If the scheme  is abandoned, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill be expected to return the  land given by the Straits Settlements Government,reimbursing them for any loss, and to repay the instalments of the Federated malay states  Governments gift, amounting  to  1,600,000; while it  will be necessary to consult the Hong Kong Government  as to the retention of the sum of  250,000contributed by that Colony.                                                        (Initialled)       P.    Colonial Office, Downing Street, S.W. 1,              October 10, 1930.
APPENDIX I.Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of the Straits Settlements to the Secretary                           of State for the Colonies.                          Dated 27th September, 1930.                   (Received 12-16 P.M. 27th September, 1930.)     UNNUMBERED.     Your despatch 4th September,  Secret,  and your telegram of 11th September,Singapore Naval Base.     The Malay States&apos; Rulers and  I, as Governor of Straits Settlements, put ourtrust in protection of British Empire.  In  our opinion, the time has not yet cometo rely solely on influence for peace of the League of Nations, of which greatest power on Pacific Sea Board, United States of America, is not a Member.   My considered opinion is that a fully protected Naval Base, as planned, would be both a safeguardand  a valuable asset to Malaya, but that an unprotected or inadequately protectedNaval Base would be a great danger to Malaya, inviting attack against which weare unable  to  defend  ourselves.  Being a  much desired site  for  a Naval Base,Singapore is a permanent temptation, whether we develop it for that purpose ornot.   The nearer the Naval Base approaches to completion the greater becomes thattemptation  if it is inadequately defended.   Moreover, &quot; slowing  down &quot;  processprolongs period during which the Naval Base is, and will be, a potential source of danger to Malaya rather than a protection.   I consider, therefore, that, unless naval base is completed and  adequately  protected within a reasonable time,  all contri-butions  made by Malaya to the scheme should be refunded  in full.  I believe thatsuch an opinion is generally held in Malaya.     Copy to Governor of Hong Kong.APPENDIX II.Paraphrase Telegram from the  Governor of Hong Kong  to the Secretary of State                               for the Colonies.                           Dated 3rd October,  1930.                    (Received 5-25 A.M. 3rd October, 1930.)    No.  127, Secret.  Your despatch, secret, 4th September, and your telegram of11th September :  Singapore Naval Base.    So far as I can judge, local opinion is silent on the question  and indifferent,but it would probably regard failure to complete the Base  as a breach of impliedcondition of gift  of  250,000 for the  Base for the benefit of British  trade and interests in the Far East.    My view is that if in the event of war Hong Kong were lost  it would almost certainly be most  difficult, if not  impossible, to  recover it  whatever might be thegeneral result of  the war.  Therefore, if it is  the Imperial  policy to retain  it,Hong Kong must  be defended to the utmost, and I consider that for its adequatedefence it is essential to complete and fully protect the Base at Singapore.    Repeated to Singapore.o
