REPORT.                                INTRODUCTION.     1. In the year 1925, when, on the rejection of the Geneva Protocol, the Powersindicated their intention of proceeding by way of regional security agreements which resulted that autumn in  the signature of the Locarno Treaty, the Assembly of theLeague of Nations asked the Council to constitute a &quot; Preparatory Commission forthe Disarmament Conference,&quot; a request which was duly executed in December, 1925.     2. The Preparatory Commission held its  first session in May, 1926, and pro-ceeded to consider a number of questions, on the  principles of disarmament, whichhad been drawn up by the Council.  A second and formal session was held, also, inSeptember of that year, but, in the meantime, the Commission had received from theAssembly, acting through the Council, a request to  expedite their work.     3. The Third Session of the  Preparatory  Commission met in March, 1927, andhad been instructed by the Council to draw up an agenda for the proposed DisarmamentConference.   His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom decided, therefore,that the time was opportune to  draw up and submit to the Commission a draftDisarmament  Convention, and such a draft, after  consideration by the  Committeeof Imperial Defence (C.I.D. Paper No. 776-B), was.duly tabled.  This draft sought to lay down the principles of reduction or limitation of armaments ; it did not makeany attempt to allot quotas to each country.     4. The French Government thereupon also submitted a draft, and,  as a resultof the Commission^ deliberations, there was drawn up a document known as &quot; Textsadopted at first reading.&quot;     5. The Fifth  Session  of  the Disarmament Commission,  the  next  session ofimportance, met in  March, 1928, when the U.S.S.R. tabled  a Draft Conventionproposing total and immediate disarmament.  The terms of this Draft Conventionhaving been found to be impracticable,  a second proposal was put forward by theU.S.S.R. for a reduction proportionate to the strength  of the existing armamentsin each country ;  this suggestion was referred to  the Disarmament Conference.In regard to the Draft Convention drawn up in 1927, it was decided to adjourn thesecond reading to allow time for further deliberations and conversations.     6. The second reading was undertaken at the  Sixth Session of the Commissionheld in April,  1929, when progress was made towards the adoption of a  single textrelating to  land and  air effectives, air material, and chemical warfare ;  the con-sideration of naval effectives and material was  postponed as, also, were the questionsof Budgetary Expenditure and &quot; Miscellaneous  Provisions.&quot;     7. The Preparatory  Commission is to meet at Geneva on 3rd November next to endeavour to put the whole of Jthe Draft Convention in  its final form.     8. We have, therefore, to examine the existing texts to decide whether we canfinally accept those provisionally agreed, and to determine the form which we should wish to give to those parts of the Convention which have not yet been submitted to detailed discussion at Geneva.     9. Our method of work has been to go through a composite text of the Convention,consisting  of the &quot; Second  Reading Text &quot; as it  emerged  from  the PreparatoryCommission in April, 1929,  and the &quot; First Reading Text &quot; of those parts of theConvention which have not yet passed a  second reading.  These texts had alreadybeen examined by a small Committee in the Foreign Office, which had  recommendedcertain alterations and additions, and these were also before us.  The  text on whichwe worked, consisting of the First  and Second Reading Texts and the  Foreign office proposals, is to be found in Column (2) of Appendix I.     10. We show, in Column (3) of the same Appendix,  the amendments suggestedby our Committee.
     11.  We attach also, as Appendix II, a copy of the complete draft, amended inthe light of our recommendations, which will, we hope, provide the model on whichthe United Kingdom Delegation can work at Geneva.     12.  It is evidently desirable, in so far as it may be possible, to avoid proposingany modification of the Second Reading Text, on which agreement has been reached,at Geneva.   The same applies in a much less degree to the First Reading Text, inregard to which it was clearly laid down that all  Delegates reserved their right to propose alterations.                            GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.     13.  Before proceeding to a detailed consideration of the articles of the Convention,there are certain points of importance to which we desire to draw especial attention.     14.  The first of these points concerns the difficult question of the limitation of trained reserves.  There are only two possible means of effecting such limitation :(1)  the actual numbers can be limited by a limitation of the annual contingent, and(2)  the efficiency of the reserves can be limited by a limitation of the period of training.We feel that it is of the utmost importance that some form of limitation of trainedreserves be devised, if the full effects of this Convention are to be realised.  armies of to-day are in process of evolution.   Mechanisation on a large scale requires a longservice Army and a highly industrialised nation at the back of it.   We are favourably-situated  in this respect, and are already experimenting.   The USA. is doing  thesame, and Germany will undoubtedly do so when the Treaty restrictions have been removed.  Although the large armies on the Continent, such as France and  Italy,are also  experimenting with mechanisation, in the main they are still man-powerarmies, and on mobilisation will put millions of men into  the field.     15.  If disarmament is to be a reality, it is obviously important to impose some form  of limitation on the trained  reserves  which form nine-tenths of the strengthof the Continental armies.  Under present circumstances  it is impossible to hopethat we  shall succeed in  inducing  the majority of  Continental countries to reduce their  annual contingent.   They insist upon the right to train every available man.We must, therefore, fall back upon the alternative which  is an attempt to reducethe efficiency of the reserves and so to curtail the power of aggression.  A considerable reduction of the period of service, to the level which exists to-day in the Swiss,Dutch, and Scandinavian armies, would really reduce armies to a defensive, level andrender aggression difficult.  There is at present little sign of such intention.  Everyreduction in service in Continental armies is counter-balanced by an  increase in long service personnel.  The period of service in the French Army has been reduced from  18  months  to one year, but  the long service  personnel has been raised from75,000 to 106,000, and various devices have been employed by which the french general Staff believe that the Army is actually more efficient with the shorter servicethan before.    Article 6 (I) of the Convention provides that in each contracting  State havingthe conscription system, the total period of service which  the annual contingent iscompelled to serve shall not exceed -days.    Article  2 (H) also deals with the limitation of long service personnel (officers,non-commissioned officers, and men).    Machinery, therefore,  exists in the Draft  Convention for  securing considerable reduction in the period of service and in the numbers of long service personnel.  It isonly on these lines that any progress is likely to be made.    16.  We come now to the second point which concerns the direct limitation of landwar material.    17.  The arguments which have hitherto been used against this form of limitation,by  a majority of the Preparatory Commission, are that to  be effective it involves, a form of supervision and inspection more drastic than any State could accept.  As faras smaller weapons are concerned  there can be no doubt  of the truth of  this laststatement.    18.  If,  however,  war material cannot  be directly controlled in  the smallercategories,  it might be possible to limit at least some of the categories of heavierweapons, and with this idea the Foreign Office had proposed to us the limitation of tanks and big guns.
    19. The technical difficulties in the way of effective limitation even  of theselarger weapons seem very great, and on the whole the advantage of limiting them would not be of great importance.  We do not, therefore, recommend that we should put it  forward, though we might accept  a suitable and  practical proposal if putforward by others.    20. If no form of direct limitation on land can be adopted, we believe it to be essential that there should be indirect  limitation by limitation of expenditure,  andwe have therefore included articles with that object.  We think that there  ought tobe a limitation of total expenditure on the land forces as well as a specific limitationof expenditure on material.   Unless material for land armies is limited in some way adisarmament treaty would be a farce.   Mechanisation is the fighting policy of thefuture.  Men will be largely replaced by machines, and to limit the former and notthe latter would be useless.  Competition in a changed form would go on as before,and the menace of &quot; bloated armaments &quot; would be in no way diminished.    21. As to the sea and the air we believe that they can and should be limited bothdirectly by limiting ships and aircraft and indirectly by limiting  expenditure.A Sub-Committee of our body considered the whole of this question, and a copy oftheir report, the main conclusions of which we accept, is attached as Appendix III.As regards the particular point referred to.in paragraph  6 (a) of the Report,  and conclusion D (ii), it is  obvious that a final decision cannot be reached without full consultation between the various Members of the Commonwealth.  It is-very desirablethat agreement between the  Members  of the Commonwealth,  should be reached, ifpossible, before the meeting of the Preparatory Commission on November 3rd.   Thegeneral question of Disarmament is already on the agenda of the Imperial Conferenceand we recommend, therefore, that opportunity should be  taken to invite discussionof the  present question under that head.    We would add two observations, however,  before leaving this subject.   Therepresentative of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia onthe Committee intimated that he had received  information  from his Governmentthat they were still in  some doubt as to the efficacy of budgetary limitation, exceptfor publicity purposes, and that they-were definitely in favour of power of virement.The  Air Ministry have also at various times pressed for power of virement, and,although the Committee as a whole do not favour this- concession, the Air  ministry have reserved the right to bring it forward again should they so desire.    The second point concerns that  of derogations ;  we understand that; if  any power of derogation is given, it should obviously extend to cover expenditure as wellas material.  We draw attention to this point in order to  ensure, for example, that,if the  Admiralty should desire and were enabled to construct  additional aircraft carriers,  no  difficulties would arise regarding the supply of such additional  new aircraft and  personnel as might be needed to equip them.             SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS TO THE DRAFT CONVENTION.Article 1 (A).    The High Contracting Parties agree to limit the  effectives determined in the tables  enumerated below and annexed to  the present  Convention the  effectives(land,  sea, and air) in service in their armed  forces or in formations organised on amilitary basis.                              /. Land Armaments.       Table I. Maximum armed forces stationed in the home country.       Table II. Maximum  armed forces stationed overseas  (optional).       Table III. Maximum of the total armed forces  of the High Contracting           Parties.       Table IV. Maximum of the forces belonging to formations organised on a           military basis stationed in the home country.       Table V. Maximum of the forces belonging to formations organised  on a           military basis stationed overseas.                             II. Naval Armaments.       Table I. Maximum armed forces.       Table II. Maximum forces belonging to  formations organised on a military           basis.
                              III. Air Armaments.      Table I.-(Optional.)  Maximum armed forces stationed in the home country.      Table II. (Optional.)  Maximum  armed forces stationed overseas.     . Table  III. Maximum of the total armed forces of the  High  Contracting           Parties.      Table  IV. Maximum of the forces belonging to formations organised on a           military basis stationed in the home country.      Table  V. Maximum of  the forces belonging to formations organised on a           military basis stationed overseas.             (Second Reading Text.)    22. The Foreign  Office asked us to  record,  particularly,  our opinion  on theeffect of making Tables I  and II  of land  and air armaments optional.   We see no need to make Table I land armaments optional so long as Table II is optional; thelatter proviso is necessary since it allows  us the right to reinforce garrisons overseasin case  of  emergency.   We think that, as regards air armaments, Tables I and  ii should both remain optional.  With these reservations we recommend the acceptanceof this Article as drafted.Article 2 (H).    The tables relating to  land  armaments  mentioned in Article 1  above shall indicate a  maximum number of officers  which each High Contracting Party shallundertake  not to exceed.    The said tables shall further  fix a maximum  number of  soldiers,  other thanofficers, who  may have completed more  than *   years of actual service with theColours.    In  conscript armies the number of men whose  service  exceeds the  legal period in force in their respective countries but is less than   *  years shall be shown foreach High  Contracting  Party in the annual statements for  which provision is madein Article 16 of Chapter V.    The tables relating to air armaments mentioned  in  Article 1 shall indicate in the form  of  aggregate  figures  for  officers,  non-commissioned officers and mentogether, the maximum number of soldiers who may have  completed more than*  years of actual service with the Colours.    The number of men of the class mentioned in the second and fourth paragraphof the present Article who are actually with the Colours shall be shown every year foreach High Contracting Party in the statements for  the preparation of which provision is made in Article 16 of  Chapter V.    Each country may, if it so desires, show for purposes of information, in a specialcolumn  in  the publicity tables provided in Article 16 of Chapter V, the number of recruits not trained as defined in  the national legislation who are embodied in theeffectives of its armed forces.                            (Second Reading Text.)    The provisions  contained in the first three paragraphs of this Article  equallyapply mutatis mutandis to the tables in Article 1 relating to  naval armaments.                                                      (First Reading  Text with                                                       Foreign Office addition.)    23. We propose, as regards naval effectives,  that  the  provisions should follow the arrangements for air effectives  rather than for military  effectives, i.e., that thereshould be a Table indicating the maximum of the total naval forces, namely, active service officers and men of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, on the understandingthat a similar limitation is generally accepted by other countries and  also, that asatisfactory agreement is reached with France and Italy respecting their programmes.Questions will doub tless arise and require to be considered  by the technical experts,as to whether  officers still under training and boys in the training establishmentsare to be included in these numbers.    No  tables  can be  given indicating, in the case  of  naval   forces,  themaximum  armed forces  stationed in the  Home  Country,  as compared withthose stationed overseas.   The naval  forces require  to  be  dealt  with  in  the    * This figure will be determined by the duration of the longest period of actual service with theColours which is in force in the conscript armies of the High Contracting Parties at the time of the signature of the Convention.
Article 7.    The High Contracting Parties agree  to limit the numbers of their tanks and heavy artillery to the figures fixed in the following table : TABLE.	Material in Service and in Reserve.	Maximum Number.Tanks ... .. .. .... .... .. .. ... Guns, long and short, and howitzers of a calibre of 15 cm. or over	(Foreign Office Text.)	aggregate.   In  accordance with  the  above,  the  following  amendments  are recommended to this Article :            (a)  Delete the last paragraph.       ,    (b)  The following paragraph to be inserted between paragraphs 3 and 4:       &quot; The tables relating to naval armaments mentioned in Article 1 shall indicate      the total of the naval forces, in the form of aggregate figures for officers, petty      officers and men together.&quot;Article 3 (C).    By &quot; formations organised on a military basis &quot; shall be understood police forcesof all kinds, Gendarmerie, Customs officials, Forest Guards, which, whatever theirlegal purpose, can be used without mobilisation, by reason of their cadres, establish-ment, training, armament, equipment, as well as any organisation complying withthe above condition.                                     (Second Reading Text.)    24. We recommend the insertion of the  words &quot; for military purposes &quot; afterthe word &quot; used &quot; in  the middle of this article.  The object of this addition is toensure that no limit can be placed on the numbers of police formations which can beused without special preparation for purely police purposes.Article 4 (D).    By &quot; mobilisation &quot; within the meaning  of the  present  Convention shall be understood all the measures for the purpose of providing the whole or part of thevarious corps, services, and units with the personnel and material required to passfrom a peace-time footing to a war-time footing.          (Second Reading Text.)    25. The Foreign Office suggested that, if any doubt existed as to &quot; reserve units and services &quot; being covered by this article,  we should support the addition of wordssuch as those proposed by the German Delegation :  &quot;It shall  also include theorganisation of reserve units and services.&quot;    We do not consider that the inclusion of these words is necessary.Article 5  (is).    When  drawing  up  the tables  mentioned in  Articles  1  (Chapter 1)  and 16(Chapter V) :  by  &quot;effectives in service  in the armed forces&quot; and by &quot; effectives in service in the formations organised on a military^ basis &quot; shall be understood theaverage daily effectives  reckoned by dividing the total number of  days&apos; duty bythe number of days in the budgetary year.                (Second Reading Text.)    26. No remarks.Article 6  (I).    In each Contracting State having the  conscription system the total period ofservice which the annual contingent is compelled to serve  shall not exceed -days.    For each man the &quot; total period of  service &quot; shall be the total number of days of active service and  of days of service  during the periods of instruction which heundergoes ; and each of such number of days shall be specified.                                                      (First Reading Text with    27. No remarks.                                 Foreign Office additions.)
     28.  We recommend the  deletion of  this  article  for  the reasons  stated  inparagraphs 17, 18, and 19.  It will have been noted that, although we do not proposethat this suggestion should be put forward, we would not  oppose a suitable and practical proposal if submitted by other countries.Article 8 (AA).     Each  of the High  Contracting  Parties undertakes to limit  the air. material  in service in accordance with the figures laid down in the following tables.     The limitation  shall apply to aeroplanes  and dirigibles  capable  of use in waremployed in commission in the land,  sea, and air forces, or in the formations organised on a military basis and  to Government-owned complete machines in reserve.     Table A. The  maximum number and total  horse-power of aeroplanes and maximum number, total horse-power, and total  volume of dirigibles in their armed forces.     Note. Any of the High Contracting Parties who so desire may annex to Table Athe following tables for limitations similar to those in  Table A.     Table A  (1). Aeroplanes  and dirigibles in commission in the armed forces stationed in the home country.     Table B (2). Aeroplanes  and  dirigibles  in commission in the armed forces stationed overseas.     Table A (3).-Aeroplanes and dirigibles in aircraft carriers.     Table B. The  maximum number and total  horse-power of aeroplanes and maximum  number,  total horse-power, and  total   volume  of dirigibles in theirformations organised on a military basis.     Note. Any of the High Contracting Parties who so desire may annex to Table Bthe following tables  for limitations similar to those in Table B.     Table  B  (1). Aeroplanes and dirigibles  in  commission  in  the  formationsorganised on a military basis stationed in the home country.     Table  B  (2). Aeroplanes and dirigibles  in  commission  in the  formationsorganised on a. military basis in overseas territories.   (Second Reading Text with                                                      Foreign Office addition.)Article 9 (AC).     Horse-power shall be measured according to the rules .  . .                     (To be established by the Conference.)     The volume of dirigibles to be expressed in  cubic metres.                                                       (Second Reading Text.)     29.  The Foreign Office proposed the addition of  the words &quot; and to Government-owned complete machines in reserve  &quot; to the end of the second paragraph of Article 8.The Air Ministry suggested  that, although they did  not object to this addition, theydoubted if it would prove effective in practice since any such definition was necessarilyvague, and the possibilities of evasion were very extensive.     30.  In regard to the actual interpretation  of. the words &quot;  Government-ownedcomplete machines in reserve,&quot; the Air  Ministry were informed that it was intendedto classify aircraft in two distinct categories first line and second line.     31.  As regards the two Articles themselves,  the Air Ministry explained that theproblem of limiting  horse-power was one of much complexity since it was possibleto evade any rules made in  a number of different ways, such  as the fitting of super-chargers and the installation of additional engines.  At our request also,  the AirMinistry made a special examination of the possibility of finding a formula whichmight be applied to the  limitation of horse-power with some  practical effect. Theyreported, however, that  they were unable to suggest any satisfactory and effectivemethod,  and the only  possible course  would  be limitation by  &quot; cubic capacity,&quot;a method full of obvious and grave defects.    32. We accept the  position nevertheless, that for what it is worth a limitationof horse-power  should be retained.Article 10 (AD).    The limitations  laid down are accepted by each High Contracting Party in thelight of the present development of civil aviation  in other countries.

Their definitive form depends on the final conclusions of those experts.    t War material to be denned either by reference to  existing categories, e&apos;.g., in the Arms TrafficConvention, or in a special Annex.    I See Appendix III.    5 War material to be denned in a special Annex.Article 11 (AE).     1. The High Contracting Parties shall refrain from prescribing the embodimentof military features in the build of civil aviation material so that this material may be constructed for purely civil purposes, more particularly with a view to providing thegreatest possible measure of security and the most economic return.  No preparationsshall be  made in civil aircraft in the time of peace for the installation of  warlikearmaments for the  purpose of converting such aircraft into military aircraft.     2, The High Contracting Parties undertake  not to  require of  civil aviationundertakings  that  they  should  employ  personnel specially trained  for military purposes.     They undertake to authorise only as  a provisional and temporary measure theseconding of personnel to, and the employment of, military material aviation in civilaviation undertakings.     3. The High Contracting Parties undertake not to subsidise, directly or indirectly,air lines  principally established for military purposes, instead of being establised for economic administration or social purposes.     4. The High Contracting Parties undertake to encourage as far as possible theconclusion of economic  agreements,  between civil aviation undertakings in  thedifferent  countries,  and to confer together to this end.      (Second  Reading Text                                                     with Foreign Office addition.)     34.  The Foreign Office proposed  to add the words &quot; and to confer together tothis end,&quot; at  the end  of  paragraph 4 of  this Article :  they felt that agreements ofthis kind could not be concluded unless  the interested parties conferred together.We recommend the acceptance of this article, in the form suggested by the ForeignOffice, on the understanding, however,. that paragraph 4 does not imply  the Inter-nationalisation of civil aviation.Article 12 (DA).     Each of the High Contracting Parties agrees  that its total annual expenditureon armaments, in any budgetary year, shall not  exceed the  figures given for it inTable* (home forces and formations of the home  country organised on a  militarybasis) and (overseas forces and their reinforcements and overseas formations organised on a military basis).                                      (Foreign  Office Draft.)Article 13 (DB).     Each of  the High  Contracting  Parties  further  agrees  that  its  total annual expenditure, in any budgetary year,  on the upkeep,  purchase, and manufacture ofwar materialt shall not  exceed the figures  indicated in  columns X, Y, and Z of table* (home forces and formations of the home  country organised on a  militarybasis) and (overseas forces and their reinforcements and overseas formations organised on a military basis).                                       (Foreign Office Draft.)     35.  The Foreign Office Committee recommended the insertion of articles limitingtotal expenditure on armaments  and also separately,  expenditure on war material.A sub-committee was appointed to consider the matter which by a majority approved the proposal and recommended that the articles should be in substance as follows : %            &quot; 12 (DA).  Each of the  High Contracting Parties agrees that its  total       annual expenditure on land, sea, and air forces, in any budgetary  year, shall       not exceed the figures given for them in Tables---&quot;            &quot; 13 (DB).  Each of the High Contracting Parties, agrees  that its  total       annual expenditure, in any budgetary year, on the  upkeep,  purchase,  and       manufacture of war material,?  shall not  exceed  the figures indicated in       Tables-&quot;
Article 17 (IB).    Each of the High Contracting Parties shall prepare an annual statement, underthe following  headings, of the number of  arms and implements of war in  service(and in reserve) in its land forces and existing on  the date of December 31st of thepreceding year:        1.  Tanks.       2.  Guns, long and short, and howitzers of a calibre of 15 cm.  or over.With a view to the exchange of information, as provided for in the  present chapter,the statement  laid down in the present provision shall be forwarded to the secretariat of the League of Nations before March 1st of the year following that to which itrefers.                                                   (Foreign Office Text.)    39.  We recommend the deletion of the  Foreign Office draft of this Article, as given above, in accordance with our recommendation that we should  not ourselvesput forward any proposals to limit heavy  guns or tanks.  (See also paragraphs 17,18, 19, and  28).Article 18.    Each of  the High Contracting Parties  shall  communicate to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, in a model  form, a statement showing the actualtotal amount expended on armaments during the preceding financial year.    It shall at the same  time communicate to the Secretary-General a  statement showing  the amount  actually expended during the preceding financial year  on theupkeep, purchase, and manufacture of war material as  defined in Article 13 of thepresent Convention.    These communications shall be made not later than-months after the close of the financial year.                                                        (Foreign Office Text.)    The High Contracting Parties undertake, subject to reciprocity, to abstain fromthe use in war of asphyxiating,, poisonous or similar gases,  and of all  analogousliquids, substances or processes.    They undertake  unreservedly  to  abstain  from the use  of  all bacteriologicalmethods of warfare.                                     (Second Reading Text.)    36.  We recommend the acceptance of this Article and, although we  realise thevery grave difficulties which he in the path of any attempt to forbid research iii thesematters, we feel that this is our aim which should not be lost sight of.Article 15.    Nothing in this chapter restricts in any way the obligations imposed  on any ofthe High Contracting  Parties by Article 8 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.                                                         (Foreign Office Text.)    37.  We recommend the acceptance of the Foreign Office draft of this Article as given above.Article 16 (L4).    Each of the High Contracting Parties shall prepare on the model of the Tablesmentioned in Article 1, an annual statement of the average daily effectives on service with  its armed forces,  and  a statement of the actual effectives on  service in itsformations organised  on a military basis.    The statement laid down in the  present  provision shall be  forwarded to theSecretary-General of the League  of Nations within three months after the close ofthe budgetary year.

    40. We  recommend the  adoption of this Article, with certain modifications.The Article, as amended, will  read as follows :            &quot; Each of the High Contracting Parties shall communicate to the Secretary    &apos;   General of the League  of Nations in a model form, a statement showing the       actual total amount expended on land, sea, and air forces, during the preceding       financial year.           It shall at  the same time  communicate to  the Secretary-General  a       Statement  showing the  amount actually expended  during  the preceding       financial year on the upkeep, purchase, and manufacture of war material as       defined in Article 13 of the present Convention.           This communication shall be made not later than-  months after the       close of the financial year.&quot;Article 19 (ID).    Each of the High Contracting Parties shall prepare an annual statement showingthe maximum figures attained during the year in respect of the number and totalhorse-power  of aircraft,  and the number, total  horse-power and total volume  ofdirigibles  in  commission according  to  their distribution laid down in  Article 8 of chapter II, Section III, Air Armaments.    This  Statement shall be forwarded to the Secretary-General  of  the League ofNations within three months after the  close of the budgetary year.                                                         (Foreign  Office Text.)    41. We recommend the acceptance of this Article as drafted by  the  ForeignOffice, subject to the substitution of the word &quot; as &quot; for the words  &quot; according  totheir distribution.&quot;Article 20 (IE).    In order to ensure publicity in the  matter of civil aviation,  each of the HighContracting Parties shall prepare an  annual statement showing the total  numberof civil aeroplanes  and dirigibles registered in the  territory under jurisdiction of eachof the High Contracting Parties.                           (First Reading Text.)    42. Add at the end of this article the words &quot; together with the expenditure by Government or local authorities.&quot;  The addition of these words is suggested tocover  Government or  municipal expenditure in support  of  civil aviation: animportant point.Article 21 (XA).    The  provisions of the present  Convention shall not  prevent  any of the HighContracting Parties from increasing its land, naval, or air  armaments beyond the agreed figures :            (1) If a war in which it is a belligerent without breach of its international       obligations, has broken out.           (2) If this increase is effected with the consent  of and subject to any       conditions laid down by the Council of the League of Nations.           Notice  to  all the other  High Contracting Parties shall be given by the       Party increasing its armaments  in pursuance of this Article.           Subject to any agreement to the  contrary  by the Parties  to this       Convention, a High Contracting Party increasing its armaments in pursuance       of the first paragraph of this  Article shall,  when peace is restored, reduce its       armaments  to the amounts agreed upon.             (Foreign  Office Text.)    43. This Article  was the subject of much  discussion :  the  difficulties whichmight arise may be summarised by saying that, while it is essential, for us at anyrate, to retain the unquestioned  right to increase our forces to meet open rebellionor organised  or unorganised unrest, it  is also essential to avoid giving countries likeGermany  and the  Balkan States loopholes to increase their armed forces on  falsepretexts.    44. Severe unrest in India or the African colonies, for example,  might requirethe despatch of reinforcements  urgently from the United Kingdom, which would,in turn, entail calling out a part or all of the reserve in order not to reduce the armed forces located in this country below the agreed minimum.  This would mean an increaseof forces,  temporarily, above the agreed figures.
    45. The case of India, of course, presents special difficulty.  India is a separatemember of the League, and the Treaty will be signed separately in respect of India.The sending of reinforcements to India will not be in the nature  of a transfer from home to overseas, but will represent an increase, beyond the contractual limits, ofthe forces of India.    46. The High Commissioner for  the  Union of South Africa emphasised the dependence of his country, for internal security purposes,  on the presence of the armed police force whom it might be necessary to increase greatly in  strength atany given moment.  He emphasised that his Government must retain  the right totake such action as any  situation might demand and that,  if the signing of thisConvention would imply any restriction on such action, he was very much afraid thathis Government would be unable to be a party thereto.    47. A further important point arose in connection with the position of theAdmiralty.  H.M. ships, in peace-time, do not carry their full complement of personnel and certain vessels are kept in reserve with skeleton  crews.    In any time of strained relations it would be necessary to complete all vessels to  full complement and  man  the reserve ships.  Such action is permitted underthe Washington Convention,  but might  be challenged,  under the disarmament convention,  as provocative  mobilisation.    The alternative  would be  to increasethe Admiralty Vote A by some 50,000 men.    48. It appears to us, as a result of our discussions, that the act of  mobilisationbefore war has not been contemplated in drafting this Convention and that the limit is only intended as regards peace strengths.    49. We suggest that the article,  as drafted by the Foreign Office, should be amended to read as follows :            &quot; The provision of the present  Convention  shall not prevent any of the       High  Contracting  Parties from increasing the  peace strength  of  its land,       naval or air armaments beyond the agreed figures :            (1) if it is faced with menace of organised rebellion or general uprising; or           (2) if this increase  is  effected  with  the  consent of and subject to any       conditions laid down by the Council of the League of Nations.           Notice to all  the other High Contracting Parties and  to the Council  of       the League shall be given forthwith by the party so increasing its armaments,       together with a statement of the reasons for such increase.           Subject to  any agreement to the contrary,  the  High Contracting Party       increasing its armaments in pursuance of the first paragraph of this article       shall,  when the occasion for the increase has ceased, reduce its armaments to       the amount agreed upon/&apos;Article 22.    The High Contracting Parties recognise  that any violation of the provisions  ofthis Convention is a matter of concern to all the Parties.             .                                                         (Foreign Office Text.)    50. No remarks.Article 23.    There shall be  set up at  the seat of the League  of Nations a &quot; permanent disarmament Commission.&quot;  The Commission shall  consist of one  nominee of eachof the following States, being parties to the present Convention ;  the Members ofthe League represented for the time being  on the Council of the League, the UnitedStates of America, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.    The Permanent Disarmament Commission shall be summoned by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations.    At any meeting    members shall constitute a  quorum.    All decisions of the Commission shall be adopted by a majority of  the votes ofthe members present at the meeting. In case of equality of votes, the Chairmanshall have a casting vote,
Article 24.    The Permanent  Disarmament Commission  shall receive  all the  information supplied by the High Contracting Parties to the Secretary-General of the league in pursuance of their  international obligations in  this regard, in particular Article 8of the Covenant and the provisions of the present Convention.    Each year the Permanent Disarmament Commission  shall make at least onereport on the information submitted to it, and on  any other information that may beavailable to it, showing the situation as regards fulfilment of the present Convention.&apos;Each member of the Commission shall be entitled to demand that account shall betaken in this report of the opinions or suggestions put forward  by him, if necessaryin the form of a minority report.    All reports shall be communicated forthwith to all the High Contracting parties and to  the  Council of the League, and shall  simultaneously be published.  such reports shall include an annual report which shall  be so communicated and publishednot later than May 31st in each year.                      (Foreign Office Text.)    52. No remarks.Article 25.    If, during the term of the present  Convention a High  Contracting Party is ofopinion that another Party to the Convention is maintaining armaments in excessof the figures agreed upon, or is making such changes in his armaments or is embarking on such preparations as  are likely to  disturb international relations or the goodunderstanding between nations, or is in  any way violating the provisions of  thepresent Convention,  such  Party may lay the matter, through the Secretary-Generalof the League, before the Permanent Disarmament Commission.  The Commission,after  hearing a representative of the  High Contracting  Party whose  action isquestioned,  should such Party so desire, and the representative of any other Partywhom the Commission may regard as specially concerned in the matter, shall presenta report thereon to  the  High Contracting Parties and the Council  of  the  League.The report and any proceedings thereon shall be published as soon as possible.  TheHigh  Contracting Parties and the Council shall thereupon  take any action  open tothem  which they may deem wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations.    53. We recommend the acceptance of this Article as  drafted by  the  ForeignOffice.  It is understood that no power  exists, under the machinery proposed in thisArticle, to carry out any  inspections in a country except by the express invitation of the Government concerned.Article 26.  9 (EA).    The present Convention shall not diminish the obligations of previous treaties,under which certain of  the High Contracting  Parties have agreed to limit their military, naval,  or air armaments, and have thus fixed in  relation  to  one  anothertheir  respective  obligations and rights  in this connection,  the present Conventionbeing within these limits inapplicable between the said Powers.                                                         (First Reading Text.)    54. We recommend the acceptance of this Article subject to the deletion  of words &quot; the present  Convention being within these limits inapplicable between  thesaid Powers,&quot; which appear to us to be without any particular meaning, and betteromitted.Article 27  (EB).    The present Convention shall be ratified by the  High Contracting Parties inaccordance  with  their respective  constitutional methods.  The  instruments  of ratification shall be deposited at Geneva.    Members of the  Commission shall be selected  for their personal  merits  andcompetence, and shall not hold any office which puts them in a position of dependence on their Governments  while members of the Commission.

* Page 35.f Pages 6 and 7.% Page 33.5 Page 7.      Note of dissent by the Air Ministry Representative on the Sub-Committee.    I regret that, since I am unable to agree with the conclusions and recommenda-tions of the Committee as regards (i) the application of a budgetary limitation to beapplied to Air  Forces  and (ii) the  imposition of a  limitation upon the horse-powerof aircraft, I am unable to sign this report.    2.  Budgetary Limitation. The views of the three Service departments uponthe desirability of budgetary limitation are briefly as follows.    The Admiralty do  not regard budgetary limitation as necessary, but are preparedto accept  it,  provided that  America .and Japan would accept a similar restriction and that due provision is made for the financial execution, if necessary, of the pro-visions of  the &quot; let out &quot; clause in the London Naval Treaty.   The War Office are infavour of budgetary limitation, but do not anticipate that, as  regards war material, itwill prove effective.  The Air Ministry are opposed to budgetary limitation for the reasons which they have stated in Appendix III and in their  dissentient note to the FinancialSub-Committee&apos;s Report  (R.A.30).*    As regards material  for land and  air forces, the Committee [see  paragraphs 17to 21 of the Report R.A. 29, t and paragraph 5 of  the  Financial Sub-Committee&apos;sReport R. A. 30 %) argue that limitation by enumeration of land and air material wouldbe ineffective unless  accompanied by &quot; supervision.&quot;  They  conclude that the only alternative is the imposition of (indirect) limitation by means of a financial restriction.It has even been suggested (page 17 of the Minutes of the Committee&apos;s 7th Meeting,and paragraph 20 of the Report, R.A. 29 g) that, in the absence of budgetary limitation,the Convention would be &quot; a farce.&quot;   In this connection I feel bound to observe thatthe London  Naval  Treaty concluded after  the  most difficult and protractednegotiations between a limited number of Powers contains  no financial provisions.And while the introduction into the Disarmament Convention  of budgetary limitationmust necessarily render international agreement far more difficult to obtain, it hasnot been suggested that, so far as this country is concerned,  any advantage is to be gained. The Air Ministry are  convinced that, as regards Air  Forces, such  a measuremust  inevitably react  to our  disadvantage.  But  the  very  reasons  which led theCommittee to reject (as regards material) the imposition of numerical limitations,apply with equal force to the suggested alternative.  The fear that bad faith on thepart of any of the Powers concerned would lead to the evasion  of numerical limitation,cannot  be disposed  of by the application of a fresh (indirect) limitation, which isby nature as readily  susceptible  to  evasion  as the  former.   In these circumstances cannot endorse the Committee&apos;s recommendations as regards budgetary limitation,though I consider that budgetary &quot; publicity &quot; might prove to be of value.    3.  Horse-power  Limitation. In recommending the acceptance of those Articlesof the draft Convention  which refer to the horse-power of aircraft, the Committeehave reversed a previous decision taken at an earlier meeting, when it  was  decided to evade, if possible,  the  application of a limitation upon horse-power.  That decision was taken as a result  of the Air Ministry&apos;s view that this  form  of  limitation  wasdisadvantageous to a country situated as we are, and that no satisfactory methodof assessing horse-power could be determined ; it had, in addition, taken into account the fact that we had already provisionally agreed (Geneva, 1927) to a limitation byhorse-power, provided that &quot; horse-power &quot;  could be satisfactorily defined.    The Committee now recommend the support of H.M. Government to this limita-tion on the grounds  that (Minutes of 7th  Meeting, page  24) it would  be undesirable to go back upon a previous provisional agreement.   I  nevertheless recommend thatwhile His Majesty&apos;s  Government should not oppose, they should not advocate,  this form of limitation, but should acquiesce in it only if pressed  and subject  to a satis-factory definition of  &quot; horse-power &quot; being made.

COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.SUB-COMMITTEE ON THE REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF ARMAMENTS.                      Composition and Terms of Reference.    1. At its meeting held on March 12th, 1930, the Sub-Committee on the reduction and Limitation of Armaments agreed :     &quot; (i) That  a Sub-Committee of the  Sub-Committee on  the  Reduction and              Limitation of Armaments should  be set  up to examine the whole              question of Budgetary Limitation and to report to the main Committee.      (ii) That the composition of the Sub-Committee should be as follows :                 Chairman.-A representative of the Foreign Office.                Members. Representatives  of the Treasury, Admiralty, War Office,                             and Air Ministry.&quot;    2. The Sub-Committee was accordingly constituted as follows :          The Right  Honourable Viscount Cecil of Chelwood, K.C. (Chairman).         Mr. A. P. Waterfield, C.B., Treasury.         Brigadier A. C. Temperley, C.M.G., D.S.O.,  War Office.         Mr. Alex. Flint, C.B., C.M.G.,  Admiralty.         Air Vice-Marshal C. L. N. Newall, C.B., C.M.G., C.B.E., Air Ministry.         Squadron Leader E. J. Hodsoll, R.A.F. (Secretary).                               INTRODUCTION.    1.  The Sub-Committee, appointed by the Sub-Committee on the Reduction and limitation of Armaments to consider the whole question of Budgetary Limitation,has held two meetings, on April 14th and May 20th, during which the views of theTreasury and the three Service departments have been fully discussed.  The viewsof the three  service departments on the question will be found in Appendices A, B,and C.                      Meaning of &quot; Budgetary Limitation.&quot;    2.  One  of the first points which the Committee discussed dealt with the exactmeaning of  the  phrase  &quot;Budgetary Limitation.&quot;  As  the representatives of theAdmiralty arid War  Office  explained, the service budget appropriations includeconsiderable sums for non-warlike purposes;  for example, each service bears  anon-effective vote which, in  the case of the War Office, amounts to the large totalof between   8,000,000  and   9,000,000 annually.  There would appear  to  be no good reason for  including in any figures, published in connexion  with budgetary limitation, sums of money devoted to these purely non-warlike purposes.    3.  The phrase &quot; budgetary limitation,&quot; therefore, must be understood to includeonly &quot; warlike &quot; expenditure.
                                 Main Question.    4. Two main questions were raised before the Committee.  The first was whetherBudgetary Limitation was in itself desirable.  The second was whether the limitationshould be applied to each of the services separately or whether there should be a rightof transfer within  the total  limitation from  one service to another the second question was, however, not further discussed beyond what was said in the main committee.    5. On the first question it may be convenient to  set out briefly the argumentspro and con :                               General Observations.       (a) No argument was put forward against budgetary Umitation of armies.       (b) As to navies, it was said that budgetary Umitation was not necessary  and            might  be in  some cases inconvenient for  the  reasons given in the            Admiralty paper.  The Admiralty, however, do not oppose it.       (c) Probably the first treaty  of limitation of armaments will produce little            if any reduction.  But once the principle is accepted and competition is            ended, the process of  reduction will increase.                        In favour of Budgetary Limitation.       (a) Without  budgetary  limitation there can be no  effective limitation of            armaments as a whole.   Personnel may be limited  by numbers.  Ships            may be hmited by numbers and tonnage, and their guns by calibre.            There may be some limitation of aircraft by numbers and horse-power ;            but this is admittedly incomplete.  And with respect to all other forms of            armament in  all three services  there  can be no  effective limitation            except, by cost.       (b) Mechanisation in armies is rapidly growing.  Many good judges believe that            future  armies will be comparatively small in  numbers  equipped with            elaborate  mechanical armaments  of all kinds.   Unless  these can be            limited, competition  in armament will continue with  ever increasing            destructiveness and enormous expense.  To limit  only the personnel            of any army would be to leave unlimited its most effective part.       (c) Land weapons cannot be limited by enumeration without  an  elaborate            system of international inspection which would be  probably ineffective            and certainly  offensive.   Budgetary limitation in some  form therefore            is the only way in which they can be Umited.       (d) These considerations  do not apply with the  same force to navies as to            armies since the chief material of navies, the ships, can be limited by            numbers and  tonnage.   But the recent German &quot; pocket &quot; battleship            seems to show that here too budgetary limitation might  not be without            its uses.       (e) The difficulties of limiting air forces are well-known.   If material is kept            in store, the numbers of planes can be multiplied very rapidly, and some            transference from civil to  rmlitary  machines  may still  be effectively            made at least, in the case of the larger civil machines.  There is therefore            great difficulty in limiting numbers.   Apart from numbers the fighting            efficiency of machines is developing continually arid the only conceivable            way of checking this is by the limitation of expense.  Mere publicity may            give  a warning of what is being prepared ;  but, unless the expenditure            is limited, growth of expenditure in one.country will act as an inducement            to corresponding growth in its neighbours.      . ^      , ^  .... :   ,.

     disparities between ratios of expenditum in relation to strengths of air     forces as measured by numbers Of aircraft;  and that the introduction     of this factor of expenditure would seriously prejudice the chances of     reaching agreement on comparative strengths in material and personnel;     furthermore, that limitation of Service air expenditure would take noj     account  of  civil aviation developments  and the  industrial  resources     underlying  them, in respect of which we  are at  a disadvantage as     compared with the chief Continental Powers.(b) It was further suggested that, if the fighting services were to be limited in     expenditure, that might lead them to ask for a large margin beyond what     they were now spending in order to allow for legitimate development.                                 Special Points.     6.  Some special points are made by the Admiralty :        (a) It is for consideration whether naval budgetary limitation shall be in the            form of a global figure, applicable to the naval forces of the members of            the British Commonwealth of  Nations taken together, or of  separate            figures in respect of the separate budgets of each individual member of            the Commonwealth.       (b) If any right of derogation as to numbers is permitted as in the case of            the recent naval treaty this must also apply to expenditure.                This is clearly right.       (c) Budgetary limitation should only be accepted in this country if it is accepted            by the United States of America and Japan.     7.  The War Office submit that any  attempt to limit expenditure on material is not likely to be successful.     This may be true, but it is thought that it could not  do any harm if  combined with the general limitation of the whole army budget which the War Office approve.     8.  The War Office also submit that it would be impracticable to seek to impose abudgetary limitation  on one service without doing  so on all.     On this point there can be no doubt that the War Office are right.     9.  The Air Ministry, though they are opposed to Budgetary Limitation, are infavour of Budgetary publicity.     10.  It  is of course understood  that no  Budgetary  comparison between one country and another can be properly made since the conditions of expense are entirely different. The object of Budgetary Limitation is not for purposes of comparison butto secure that limitation of armaments shall be a reality  and not a pretence.                                  Conclusions.     (A)  Budgetary Limitation is the only way in which  armaments as a whole canbe limited  and the Committee* recommend that it should be included in the draft treaty.     (B)  It  should be applied to  all the services separately and  there should  be notransference or virement permitted.     (C)  Where derogation from  numbers is permitted by treaty it must also apply            to expenditure.     (D)  As far as naval forces are concerned        (i) Limitation of expenditure cannot be accepted for us unless it is accepted            by other naval powers.      (ii) Further consideration  must  be  given to the  question whether limitation            of expenditure should be separately applied to each of the nations in the            British Commonwealth.   * Note. As will be seen, the representative of the Air Ministry was not able to sign the report forthe reasons given hereafter.

HODSOLL,          Secretary to the Sub-Committee.2, WHITEHALL GARDENS, S.W.1.    11th July, 1930.    1. I regret that I cannot subscribe to this Report.    2. As  regards  Conclusion  (A) the views of  the Air Ministry in opposition toBudgetary Limitation, in principle, as applied to air forces, are set out in Appendix &quot; C&quot;to the Report.  These views are not adequately reflected by the Report.    3. Paragraph 4 of the Report refers to the alternative of limitation of expenditure(a) by each of the services separately and exclusively and (6) with a right of transferof expenditure (within the Budgetary total for the- three services combined) from one service to another,  and states that this question was  not pressed.   I  cannot agreethat it was  even discussed.  It is not otherwise referred to in the Report  except in theform of Conclusion  (B), from which I am compelled to record my dissent.    4. With regard to  Conclusion (B), the view of the Air Ministry is that if theprinciple of Budgetary Limitation were admitted at all such limitation should takethe form of a single combined total defence Budget limit; and that if  it were proposed to apply separate limitation to each  individual arm, some power of virementwould be essential to permit of readjustments of defence expenditure as between thethree  arms.  A further  consideration is that Budgetary Limitation for each of theservices separately  could, in practice, be easily evaded ;  it would, in particular, be easy to conceal air  expenditure by bearing parts of it against naval, military, and civil aviation budgets the latter being free from any limitation.    5. Paragraph 10 of the Report states that &quot; no Budgetary comparison between one country and another can properly be made.&quot;  It is, however, obvious that suchcomparisons are inevitable, and that no limiting figure could be arrived at which didnot involve  comparisons.  Such  comparisons  must  be  disadvantageous  to  thiscountry.                                            (Sgd.)  C. L. N.

(E) Though the Air Ministry do not agree to Budgetary Limitation, the majorityof the Committee feel that it is impossible to ask for the exemption  from suchlimitation  of one of the fighting services and not of the others.
                                 APPENDIX A.                        STATEMENT  BY ADMIRALTY.    The Admiralty view is that Budgetary Limitation is not essential to any effectivelimitation of naval armaments.  An effective limitation of naval forces can be achieved by limiting the numbers or tonnages of warships in various  categories and it  iscertainly not essential that Budgetary Limitation should be superimposed on such asystem of limitation.  Indeed, Budgetary Limitation (unless accompanied by safeguards)may imperil policy besides involving various administrative difficulties.  As a matterof Government policy, for example, provision was made in  Article 21 of the  london naval Treaty that if the requirements of the British Commonwealth of Nations arematerially affected by new construction  of any power other than those of Japan andthe United States  of America, an increase may be made in the  total tonnage of theBritish Commonwealth of Nations as limited by  Part III of the Treaty.  Any suchincrease would be  reflected in expenditure and it would be  difficult to forecast, evenover a short period, whether such increase would be necessary, as it is so muchdependent upon the action of other nations.  The question  of an analogous financialclause to Article  21 in  any agreement  about  budgetary limitations would requirespecial consideration.  As an example  of an administrative  difficulty,  budgetary limitation  might  militate  against  the early carrying out  of possibly  expensivealterations to H.M. ships or their armament to provide protection against some new form or development of attack.    2. On the other hand, it is recognised that, from the point of view of the army,Budgetary Limitation has been maintained to be an essential method of limitation,and the Admiralty, though not recommending Budgetary Limitation for naval forces,will be prepared to acquiesce in a naval  Budgetary Limitation, subject to conditions,namely, that it will be open to this country to state  an estimated annual figure  ofnaval expenditure which will provide a suitable margin for contingencies, and thatthe figure of the present  Naval Estimates be not taken as the basis, and that a satis-factory  method for  meeting the contingency in Article 21  of the  London naval treaty be evolved.  At  present the Admiralty do  not see a method of providing,under the system of  a Budgetary Limitation, for that contingency.    3. In view of the fundamental issues behind the numerical  limitations andratios agreed to between U.S.A.,  Japan, and the  British Commonwealth of  nations in the Washington and the London Naval  Treaties,  the Admiralty consider that naval Budgetary  Limitation could only  be  accepted provided the United Statesof America and Japan also agreed to a similar limitation.    4. In acquiescing  in Budgetary Limitation,  the  Admiralty assume that therewill be one total figure which will include naval expenditure on material and personnelcombined,  i.e., bona fide warlike  expenditure, but that  the  limiting figures willexclude expenditure on such items as pensions,  observatories, etc., etc.    5. They also think that it is  for consideration whether the United Kingdom and each of the Dominions  and India should be treated separately for purposes of navalBudgetary Limitation, although in the Washington and London Treaties the  ships ortonnage of categories of ships belonging to the naval forces of the members of theBritish Commonwealth of Nations have been combined.    6. It will be  essential of course that the &quot; derogations &quot; in any disarmament convention shall allow a country to increase its financial expenditure equally  with itsincrease in its naval  armaments beyond agreed  figures, as the increase in the latter will be reflected in the Budget.ADMIRALTY,    21st May, 1930.
                               APPENDIX  B.                       STATEMENT BY WAR OFFICE.    The General Staff have  always been in favour of a limitation of Budgetaryexpenditure as a valuable  check upon any other form of limitation decided upon.If spread  over a number of years figures for budgetary expenditure are also a clear indication of the pacific or aggressive tendencies of a State.    As the Treasury representative has withdrawn his proposal for virement betweenthe Services, it is presumed that no further comment on this point is required.    It will be  necessary to re-draft Article 12 so that it is clear that the limitation isto be applied to each service separately.  It will also be necessary, sooner or later, to define exactly  what &quot; Budgetary Limitation &quot; is to include.    The General Staff, while not opposing the limitation of expenditure on material,feel bound to  point out that  it will be largely valueless in operation, so far as LandDisarmament  is concerned, for the reasons given  by them in  R.A. 6.*    THE WAR OFFICE,           21s* May, 1930.            APPENDIX C.STATEMENT  BY THE  AIR  MINISTRY.            BUDGETARY  LIMITATION  OF  AIR EXPENDITURE.     1. The following note has been  prepared  in accordance  with the  Chairman&apos;s- request  for a  further consideration by the Air Staff  of their views in regard to Budgetary Limitation of expenditure on air armaments.     2. The outstanding objection, in  the view of the Air Staff, to such limitation by the international agreement is         (i) that the insertion of a provision for  expenditure limitation in the Draft             Disarmament Convention would seriously prejudice  the prospect of             agreement between the principal Air Powers as regards the size of their             air forces :       (ii) that if failure ensued on the issue  of relative Budgetary allotments,  the             responsibility for the failure would  inevitably,  however wrongly,  be             visited upon Great Britain and not upon any of the Continental Powers.     3. There would be no objection to Budgetary Limitation if it could be assumed that the  maximum allowable figures of expenditure would be a mere translation in terms of  money made  by each country for itself and with a  reasonable margin for contingencies and other unforeseeable developments of the  maximum figures of strength  in terms of material and personnel.     4. In the  matter of air armaments it is impossible to believe that discussions at a Disarmament  Conference  would proceed so  conveniently  and  uncontentiously. Before the question of Budgetary Limitation was approached the Conference would have to reach agreement as to the maximum permissible strength, measured in terms of aircraft (including aircraft in  reserve), maximum  horse-power and personnel. It is impossible to expect that agreement on these  points would be reached except after long and difficult  discussions.  If a further agreement as to the standard of maximum permissible expenditure by each of the Powers concerned has then to be reached,  it is,  in  the view of the Air Staff inevitable  that many  new contentious factors would  be introduced, which  would risk bringing  the whole structure of agreement to the ground.  The difficulty may be illustrated  by assuming that  the recent Naval  Conference had set out to strike ratios not only of naval strength but also  of naval expenditure.
    5. The reasons on which the Air Staff base their opinion have already been generally indicated in RA. 22.*  They may here be briefly recapitulated :        (i) The ratio of expenditure in relation to first line strength is, and must be,            higher  in this  country than  in Continental  Powers because of inter            alia-[a)  voluntary recruitment  and its much higher standards of pay,            feeding and accommodation of personnel ;  (&amp;) our higher standards of            workmanship and safety ; and (c) the necessity for a large proportion            of the force to be trained and equipped for garrison duty overseas with            consequent greater expenditure oh equipment and transportation.      (ii) Civil aviation, and more particularly  the  industrial resources and  other            facilities primarily maintained for civil aviation purposes, constitute an            important and latent reserve of military air strength.  In this respect,            Great Britain is at a marked disadvantage by comparison with neigh-            bouring countries.      (iii) The primary standard of comparison of land forces (armies) is in terms of            personnel.  The  total gross estimated expenditure on the British Army            for 1930 is  38,000,000 (non-effective services excluded) : of that amount,            the main items of expenditure are for pay, maintenance, quartering, and            movements of the personnel, and only  2,700,000 (7 per cent, of the total)            is allotted for warlike stores. The primary standard of comparison on the            other hand for  naval forces and for air  forces is in terms  of technical            equipment ships of war in the one  case, aircraft in the other.  British            naval expenditure for 1930 is estimated  at  47J millions (non-effective            expenditure excluded) of which  21 f millions,  i.e., 45 per cent,  is for            warlike stores (shipbuilding, repairs,  and armament).  For the Air Force            the  ratio of expenditure on  technical equipment is even  higher, i.e.,             9-1 millions or 46 per cent, out  of a total of   20,600,000.  -                But whereas in the case of navies, no concealment is possible as to            the number or (in general) as to the size of vessels built and maintained,            no such inherent publicity exists as regards the production of aircraft            and engines particularly when unassembled.  It follows that if a limitation            of expenditure  is  added to the limitations on  number of aircraft, on            horse-power and on  personnel,  it will   be claimed  that  expenditure            provides  a  new  and  independent standard of comparison, and one as            valid as comparison in terms of aircraft or personnel.  It  will be argued            that the higher the standard of  expenditure in relation to any nominal            first-line strength, the higher is  the  degree of true air strength thereby            implied, and compensation in terms of  increased first-line strength or            otherwise will be asked for by the lower spending powers.      (iv) Under our own budgetary and accounting arrangements the secret diversion            to increasing aircraft  reserves of moneys voted for other purposes is  a            possibility which need hardly be considered.  But it would be difficult            to convince other countries that this is the  case, and it is impossible            to hope that there would be much mutual  reliance  on this  point as            between  the chief Continental  Powers.   This is illustrated by recent            discussions in regard  to present  military expenditure in Germany.       (v) If expenditure is once admitted as an integral factor in limiting air strengths,            the  amount of our own Estimates, necessarily higher in relation to any            given strength, would be a continual embarrassment in all negotiations            for  international agreement.   It is significant that a misleading article            has recently appeared in &quot; Le Temps &quot; on the questions of comparative            air expenditure in France and in this country.  This article endeavours            to explain away the fact that, whereas our own gross air expenditure in            1930 is actually lower than it was in 1925, French air expenditure has            more than  doubled during the same  period.  &quot; Le Temps  &quot; then reaches            the conclusion that, between  1925 and 1930, England has spent the sum            of  99,000,000 on the air, whilst claiming that French expenditure  has            not exceeded half of this &quot; chiffre vraiment colossal.&quot;   The article in            question conveniently ignores considerations such as (a) conscription,            (6) the geographical dispersion of the British  Empire as compared with            the relative concentration of French Possessions (factors  which have
            already been  referred to), to say  nothing of (c)  the generally  lower            standards of living and prices in France.  These  considerations entirely            vitiate any comparison on an expenditure basis.                There is, however, no need to analyse these and the numerous other &apos;           fallacies underlying the French figures and their general  thesis.   This            article does, however, well illustrate the very misleading type of calcula-            tion which will necessarily result from any attempt to introduce a system            of Budgetary  Limitation, and also the controversy and friction which,            without any compensating advantage, such a system would inevitably            engender owing to the extent  to  which figures  of expenditure can be            variously  interpreted,  or  indeed  actually manipulated,  in  different            countries.      (vi) A  theoretical  claim to  parity in  air strength  with France  (which it is            assumed that  His  Majesty&apos;s Government would not forego) would in            itself imply a claim for a considerably higher budgetary maximum than            that of our  present air expenditure.  This  claim would in itself be an            embarrassment and expose us to misrepresentation.    6. The above, objections do not apply to budgetary &quot; publicity &quot; which already exists in a large measure  as regards  our own air expenditure though it will be inevitable that international comparisons would be made. The Air Staff  are  fully in favour of such publicity  being provided for in  a  Disarmament  Convention.It is very desirable that this form of publicity should include a return of State and municipal expenditure on civil aviation.    7. In view of the objections to Budgetary Limitation as such, no reference is madein this paper to the details and difficulties which separate limitation by arms (naval,military, and air) would  create by restricting the powers of a Government to  effecteconomies in the total sum of its  defence expenditure by  means.of readjustment ofresponsibility as between the three separate arms.AIR STAFF,    5th June, 1930.

(C.I.D. Paper No. 1016-B.)(Previous References :  C.I.D. Minutes of the 229th Meeting, Minute 5. and of the                          238th Meeting, Minute 15.)    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the Report of the Sub-Committeeon  the  Reduction  and Limitation  of Armaments  (C.I.D.  Paper  No.  1016-B).containing a Report on the Draft Disarmament Convention which will be consideredby the Preparatory  Disarmament Commission at Geneva on the 3rd November, 1930.    THE PRIME  MINISTER said that, unfortunately, this was not an  agreedreport, since the Air Ministry  Representative had signed a  dissentient note (videpage 17).  He understood that the points of difficulty related to budgetary limitationand horse-power limitation, and he would be glad if the Secretary of State for Airwould explain his views to the Committee.    LORD THOMSON said,  in the first place, he would like to  observe that theAir Ministry were not  alone in their objections to budgetary limitation. He would refer  the Committee to Appendix B of Appendix III to the Report,  on  page 37,where it would be seen that the General Staff stated that, &quot; while not opposing thelimitation of expenditure  on material, they felt bound to point out that it will  be largely  valueless  in operation,  so  far as land disarmament is  concerned.&quot;   Itappeared  also  that  the Admiralty were by  no means  favourably disposed.   InAppendix A of Appendix III, on page 36, it was stated that &quot; the Admiralty view is  that  budgetary limitation  is not essential  to any  effective limitation  of naval armaments.....   Indeed, budgetary  limitation (unless  accompanied  by safe-guards)  may  imperil policy besides involving various administrative  difficulties.&quot;The Admiralty further went on, in paragraph 2 of this statement, to quote  two vitalconditions which they desire to be fulfilled before they could  agree to  this form  of limitation,  these conditions being, firstly,  that it will be open to this country to state&apos;an  estimated annual figure of naval expenditure which will provide a suitablemargin for contingencies, and, secondly, that the figure of existing naval estimatesis not taken as a basis, and that a satisfactory method is evolved for  meeting the contingency in Article  21 of the London  Naval Treaty.   It was further added,  atthe end  of this paragraph, that the Admiralty could not at present see  any methodof providing under the system of budgetary limitation for the contingency  inArticle 21 of the London Naval  Treaty.  The chief point of the Air Ministry was.that budgetary limitation cannot be made effective  as regards air forces.   Our  ownair  force, being on a. voluntary  basis,  was necessarily  expensive, and the fact  thatit was distributed in different parts of the world  added considerably  to  the cost..There could be no doubt whatever that our air force was vastly more costly in com-parison  with those possessed either by France or Italy. There was a further pointin that  both  labour and  material were  more expensive in  this  country than  in continental countries. He would like to draw the especial attention of the Committeeto the position of France and the methods she adopted to camouflage  expenditure      [21769-31                                                      B
on her air force.  In the French air estimates for 1930-31 a figure of  16,370,000was shown, but, in addition to this figure, and included in other votes, were furthersums which brought the whole total up to  21,000,000.  If we agreed to budgetary limitation, the cost of our air force would be as shown in the published statements,but in the case of France it was obvious that only a proportion of the true cost wouldbe made public.  In other words, he could not  avoid the conclusion that we shouldbe at a very grave disadvantage.  He would emphasise again that the very positionof this country, supporting a voluntary air force distributed at the four corners ofthe globe, must add directly to her disadvantage in comparison with the continentalPowers,  with their system of conscription  and  the comparatively limited liabilities of their air  forces.  To this he would  add the reminder  that, in  the air force,expenditure on material amounted to something like 46 per cent,  of  the total, andthat, taking  into consideration  the increased costs of labour and material  in thiscountry, a continental  air force  could,  for the same amount, produce a vastlysuperior service from the  numerical point  of view.  He thought he  was correct instating  that  the  Admiralty  shared the views of the Air Ministry regarding thispoint.  It seemed to him that the imposing of this  form of limitation, with itsobvious inequalities and imperfections, could not but tend  to produce internationalfriction and suspicion.  There was another very important  point to which he would draw the attention of the Committee. The Air Force were at present  working onan expansion  scheme which was to build up to  52 home defence squadrons by 1938.At the present moment the strength  of the Service was considerably short  of this total, but it was  their  aim  to  work  up gradually to this amount, and he wouldobserve that  this expansion programme had  been  approved by three  successive governments.  The French  were carrying out a similar expansion scheme.  At thepresent moment they had  1,350 first-line machines, but by  1938 they  would have2,000, whereas, at the completion of our scheme, we should only possess 1,000. Hewould observe that, if the figures produced under any scheme of budgetary limitationwere to be set at such a high standard as these figures implied, then,  in effect,  itwould be worse than futile, and, as he had said, must inevitably engender suspicionand create friction.   The Air Ministry would, however, be prepared to welcome asystem of budgetary publicity,  particularly vis-a-vis France.  He wrould go  further and say that  the Air Ministry would not  object to a  global limit which embracedall the three Fighting Services, provided that power of virement  was accordedwithin this&quot; global figure between the three Services.  It seemed to him that no actualreduction would be possible if the present proposals were adhered to, and that thewhole tendency would be to make the maximum the minimum.  He must urge the very real difficulties of applying, in practice, any form of budgetary limitation underthe widely dissimilar  conditions prevailing  amongst the  various  nations.   Hethought  that the  Admiralty agreed with the position which he had stated because,like the Air Force,  they spent, he believed,  something like 40 per cent, of their totalvote in equipment.    MR. SHAW said he would like to clarify  in his mind the exact  position taken up by the Air Ministry.  He wished to know whether they took their stand on theprinciple that it would be wrong to have budgetary  limitation, because it would leave us in an inferior position, whereas, in actual practice, we were visualising an expansion of our Air Force so as to reach parity with some  other  Power; or didLord Thomson mean to claim that budgetary limitation could be applied to the otherFighting Services, but  not to the Royal Air Force ?   Regarding Lord Thomson&apos;spoint that the Air Forces were scattered over the world, this surely applied equally to the Army, as  did also  the question of labour and material  costs.  Despite these difficulties, however, the War Office were in favour of the  application of budgetary limitation.     MR. HENDERSON said that the arguments put forward by the Air Ministryought surely  to have been voiced in the Cabinet.  According to his recollection, the Cabinet had  decided that the Government would accept the principle of budgetary limitation as one of the methods to be applied for disarmament.*  He  also  thought that this principle had been tacitly  accepted by His  Majesty&apos;s Government  in the United  Kingdom  at Geneva,  and  that, thereafter, the present Government had always  stood by this principle.  In other words, we were irrevocably committed, both in  public and in private, to the  principle of budgetary limitation; he would go                                * See footnote on p. 5.
$Qifar^as to say that he could not see how any Disarmament, Convention could operate;effectively if it did not,include some means of budgetary limitation..  As an, example,and in support of, his contention,, he, would draw, attention  to the fact, that under;the Treaty of Versailles - Germany was permitted  six  warships  of  a certain type;,,&apos;but the  Treaty of Versailles did not apply any form of budgetary limitation, withthe result  that Germany proceeded to build a  pocket battleship, which cost quite asmuch, if not more, than any similar ship of double the size.  If budgetary limitation.had been applied in the Treaty of  Versailles Germany could  never have constructedsuch a vessel, which had caused grave misgivings both in France and in Italy.  Tohis mind,  one thing was perfectly certain, and that was that we could not at thepresent  stage go back on our acceptance  of  the principle of applying budgetary limitation.  As regards the practical details of the application of this  principlethen he  agreed that consultation between the  three Fighting Services was not onlyhighly desirable  but essential, in order that plans might be  prepared for  the workof the Disarmament Conference.    These plans must ensure that we were not placedin a position of inferiority.  In that he was in agreement with Lord Thomson, buthe would ask him, did he suggest  that the whole plans for disarmament should beheld up or prejudiced on account of a possible expansion of our own Air Force?,When this expansion  scheme was  considered and approved there  was no thought pfa world disarmament convention  taking place; the position  now was  on  a totally different plane.   He earnestly hoped that Lord Thomson  would  agree  with  thepresent  plans, and go forward on the understanding that the detailed applicationof the various principles should be worked out between the  Fighting Services, and considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence in due course.    MR. ALEXANDER said that the Navy had found the acceptance of budgetary limitation to be a matter of difficulty, but, nevertheless, they had fallen in &quot;with what they understood were the views of the Government, and had signed the Reportof the Sub-Committee on the Draft Disarmament Convention.  Lord Thomson hadalready  quoted  the  views of the Admiralty, which  were  given on  page 36  ofC.I.D. Paper No. 1016-B, and he felt he must add that the Admiralty  definitelyfelt there  was a danger in accepting a form of budgetary limitation which bore horelation to personnel and material.   Then again, there was the question of  theoperation  of Article 21 of the London Naval Treaty.   If this country was to show,in her Budget, a sum sufficient to  cover margins&apos; for all contingencies, then it mightimply an expansion of tlie Fleet, which was not, in  fact, contemplated at all.   Thenagain, there was the position of France to consider, and he could not  see that theFrench would agree to any figures which did not include for them the provisions ofthe Statute Navale.  In fact, he felt that principles of a disturbing effect might be.produced by the attempt to  impose budgetary  limitation on the naval forces of thevarious  Powers.   But  the  Admiralty were   perfectly willing  to try and find  apractical solution to these difficulties, and although the  naval staff had drawn atten-tion to the pocket battleship, they had expressed the view that,  since this form of vessel was limited both in tonnage and the calibre of its guns, it  did not present, sofar as  we were concerned,  such  a formidable proposition  as  perhaps might  beanticipated.    THE PRIME MINISTER observed that he understood  the position in regardto budgetary limitation,  as  stated by  the  Foreign  Secretary, was that the cabinet had accepted it in principle as part of agreements already made.  The Air ministry had  submitted  a Memorandum  which did two things.  Firstly,  it opposed  theprinciple  of budgetary  limitation; and  secondly, supposing this  principle was accepted, then it wished to  restrict its application.    Some very important pointshad been put forward by Lord Thomson and the First Lord of the Admiralty, which,he agreed, must be examined with a view to the working out of practical proposals,.but this did not affect the principle of the matter.    Lord Thomson had suggested  that virement should  be allowed between  the three services, but he  could not for one instant imagine that France would  be  preparedto accept such a proposal.   It was essential that the Budget should show the totalcost, and he hoped that it might be possible to get agreement  with France regardingthis ppint.    LORD THOMSON said that;,, although, he understood the Government favoured the principle of budgetary limitation, the Fighting Services had been asked for theiropinions.   The Admiralty said, in effect,  that they did not  recommend budgetary      [21769-3]                                                   B 2
 limitation for naval forces; the War Office said that, although they did not oppose the limitation of expenditure on material, they felt bound to point out that it would be largely valueless in operation.   It appeared to  him,  therefore, that the three Fighting Services were not at all enthusiastic  about this proposal.   Although the Navy and the Army  were prepared  to  accept  it, they had,  in  fact, damned the suggestion with faint praise.     MR.  SHAW suggested  that,  if  virement  was  to be  included  in budgetary limitation, the whole principle would be destroyed.  Lord  Thomson had referred to the doubts  of the  War Office  as to. the effectiveness of  budgetary  limitation  of material; this was not the point at issue.  He could understand  the  attitude of a fighting service not welcoming a definite  limit being  imposed on its expansion, but tfiis did not vitiate the argument that limitation of expenditure was one way  of limiting the growth of armaments.  He felt strongly that budgetary limitation must play  an  important part  in  any  disarmament convention.   Although willingly accepting the principle he realised that there were difficulties regarding its practical application, and he was in favour of an examination of these difficulties to  see how an equitable solution could be produced.  It was particularly  necessary to  provide some means by which a  common standard could  be  achieved  for   purposes  of comparison.     THE PRIME MINISTER said that, if the principle of budgetary limitation had been accepted as an essential part of disarmament, the problem now7  was to ensure to ourselves the necessary safeguards within this principle, and he would suggest that the three Services and any other Departments interested should  confer together and report to the Cabinet as to the best means of application.    LORD  THOMSON said that he understood the Prime Minister to say that the principle of budgetary limitation had been definitely  accepted, but that within that principle he agreed that the Service Departments should confer together with a view to overcoming the practical difficulties of its application.  There was a  further point which had been raised in the Report which concerned the application of horse-power limitation and to which the Air Ministry also took exception.   He would ask thatthis point might be considered at  the  meetings of the committee  suggested  by the Prime Minister  and that horse-power limitation could be considered as an entirely free issue.    THE  PRIME  MINISTER  agreed  that  this  was  a matter  for   further investigation.    MR. THOMAS asked whether it was proposed to include representatives of theDominions at the meetings of this Committee.    MR. HENDERSON remarked that four of the Dominions had been represented on the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence and had actually signed the Report.    THE PRIME MINISTER, after some  discussion, agreed that  it would bebetter not to ask the Dominions to be present at the meetings of the Committee.    LORD  THOMSON asked, further, if the Prime Minister  would  agree to thequestion of virement remaining open.    THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Committee could  discuss whatever  itliked  so long  as it kept  within the  principle that budgetary limitation had beenaccepted.
