NORTH JEST  FRONTIER OF INDIA   &quot;  THE              MEASURES * PROPO S ED &quot;BY  THE GOVERNMENT OF           &quot;   INDIA FOR DEALING WITH THE AFRIDIS.               Report by the Defence of India               Sub - Coma i 1.1 e e  of the Corom it ted                   of Imperial Defence.            The  Cabinet  at a masting held on Tuesday, . 30th  September       1930,  had before  them  a memorandum by the Secretary  of  State       for  India, regarding the measures proposed  by  the  Government       of India, for dealing  with  the  Afridis,   (CP. 321 (30)).       2,  The  Cabinet  agreed:-               &quot;That the  Secretary  of  State&apos;s memorandum                ^CoPc321  (30)),  should  be remitted  for                immediate examination  by the Defence  of                India Sub-Committee of  the Committee  of                Imperial  Defence,  which  should  be  asked                to include in  their Report  an  appreciation                of what  is the maximum commitment  and risk                involved  in  the proposed operation&quot;.       3. .  The  Sub-Committee met, as  a matter  of  urgency,  at  2 p0m.       on Wednesday the  1st October.   At this meeting they  had the        advantage of the  presence  of General Sir Philip  Chetwode,        Commander in Chief in  India (designate).        4,   The only new development  since  yesterday&apos;s  Cabinet       meeting is a report  of a conversation  with  Shah  Waltj  Afghan       Minister in London,  at the Foreign  Office,  the purport  of which       may be summarised as  follows;-  Shah Wali Khan stated  that his        brother.  King Nadir Shah,  had  instructed him privately  to  discuss        quite unofficially the attitude of H.M.  Government towards the        tribes on  the North-West Frontier.   He  said that the King        urged on H.K. Government  /
the importance cf a quick settlement with these tribes and, inparticular,, with the Afridis by methods cf conciliation, as thetime was ripe for a solution which would pacify Mohammedanfeeling.  The Afghan Minister then developed his brother&apos;s text.In doing so, he showed himself anxious lest the Government cfIndia should contemplate measures of the most drastic kind;  he stated that if the Afridis wero &quot;wiped out&quot; the other tribes wouldbe obliged by honour and religion to undertake a war of revenge;that if we laid Tirah waste we should merely make room forbraver and fiercer tribes;  that if we settled the Afridis inMadras and Bengal they would not be likely to remain there(as is shown by similar experiments tried by the AfghanGovernment), that if they were driven to flee from their own country they would receive hospitality from ether tribes and return to raid the Frontier.  Shah Wall Khan also pointed outthat the Afridi problem was comparatively simple because therewere no Afridis in Afghanistan but that the case would be very different if other tribes (Mohmands, Mahsuds or Waairs) weroinvolved;  no  Afghan King cculd hope to restrain Afghan tribesmenif their fellow-tribesmen across the Frontier needed their help,and a threat to their religion or their independence would unitesuch tribes regardless of international boundaries;  in such acase King Nadir would not shirk his duties but his 07m positionwould bo critical.   He added that the Afghan Government were not concerned with the terms of any settlement which the Governmentof India might attempt but he earnestly recommended a concession in respect of the Sarda Act which, he said, was contrary to theMohammedan religion.5.   The Sub-Committee note that the limited proposals of theGovernment cf India are not such as to provoke the consequencesfeared by the Afghan Minister1.
6.        The Sub-Ooimaittee note the apprehensions ofthe Government of India that, unless prompt steps are taken to deal with the Afridi menace, there is a sub--stantial risk not only of a tribal rising, but even cfwar with Afghanistan.   In these circumstances theyconsider that (a) a plain assertion of authority, and(b) material measures to protect our territory, arerequired;  and they agree that the cons true oi.cn of theroads proposed by the Government cf India is a practicalmethod of achieving these objects.7.        If this general proposition is acceptable tothe Cabinet, there appear, broadly speaking, to be three courses open to us %-     (a) to summon the Afridis end inform them cate-  gorically that we intend, to build these roads in  order :-  (i) to punish them for their misdeeds of the  past six months by denying them access- to the Ehajuri  plain,,-and thus depriving them of their winter grazing &quot; grounds;  and (ii)..-to prevent any recurrence of their  misdeeds;     (b) to  summon the Afridis and inform them of our  intention  to  build the roads forthwith in language  equally categorical, but less likely to provoke  opposition.    They might,  for example,  be told that  the roads  are not intended, as a punishment for the  past but a deterrent for the future,  and that they  would not  be  used by us  for aggressive  action,  unless  this was demanded by their own misbehaviour.    In
addition,  it might be pointed  out  that the roadswould be to their own economic advantage if theyacquiesced in, instead of obstructing, theirconstruction;     (c) to summon the Afridis, and treat the con-struction of the roads as one  of the subjects for negotiation.     The Sub-Commit tee ar&apos;.* inclined to favour theadoption of alternative (b) above;  but, in view ofthe fact that its membership includes technical advisers, it refrains from making any definite reccm-mendation on what is an essentially political question.     Turning now to the question specifically referredto the Sub-Committee by the Cabinet, it is thought thatthe contingencies which might  tend to increase the risks and commitments involved in the proposed operation are twofold, namely, (a) a temporary reverse to thetroops covering the construction of the roads, and(b) sympathetic action in support of the Afridis onthe part of other Frontier tribes.     The Sub-Committee are of  opinion that the possible consequences of the first contingency can be assessedonly by those who rare on the spot.   At the same timeSir i-hilip Onetwode expressed  the personal opinj onthat a temporary reverse to our arms need not involve
            any extension of the limited objective now proposed.&apos;            Local reinforcements might,  he thought,  be necessary,            but there need be no question of military forces            penetrating further into Afridi country:  the fulfilment-            of our declared purpose to build the roads would be            all that would be required,   Further,  the Chief of            the Air Staff pointed out that air forces could be            employed from their present locations&apos; to restore any            situation that might result from a temporary setback;            by operations against the villages of the hostile            sections.       11.        On the question of the possibility of sympathetic            action in support of the Afridis by the other frontier            tribes, the Sub-Committee are advised that this            contingency would be more likely to be the outcome of            our failure to deal with the Afridi situation than of            any action we may take to do so.  Here again the            Chief of the Air Staff suggested that the correct            employment of air forces would avoid the necessity of            extending our military commitments to other parts of            the frontier.                            Initialled on behalf of the Sub-Committee.                                                . B.2,  Whitehall Gardens,  S. ft&apos;,1.            2nd October, 1930.
