THIS DOOUHBHT  IS THE  PROPERTY  OP HIS BRIT A WHIG MAJESTY5 S  GOT!&quot;BET.                                                    O0py m&apos;                             0 A B I  NET.\ 510 (30),j IMATERNAL MORTALITY.          With, reference to the Memorandum (G.P. 300 (30)) onthe, above subject which was circulated &quot;by the Minister of health on  10th September, 1930. I am in agreement with his statementof  the difficulties that would have to ba overcome before ascheme of maternity service on the lines indicated in theAppendix to his memorandum could be successfully launched. .   I also fully appreciate the serious additional financial commitment which ths* scheme would throw on the Exchequer.    In the circum^stances 1 think that further consideration might be given tohis alternative proposal, the basis principles  of which are setforth on pages 3 and 4 of the memorandum.   Incidentally I maymention that a scheme on the lines of that proposal would fit in more closely with the normal development of  maternity services bylacal authorities in Scotland than one which was linked up,  inthe manner suggested in the memorandums with the scheme of HationalHsalth Insurance.   It would also avoid any differentiation inthe treatment of insured and uninsured persons  at the hands ofIiical authorities j  a matter which,, as experience of the workingof Sanatorium Benefit has already shown is fraught with difficulty:          The last  sentence of the memorandum irdicat.es that better value might  be obtained from National Health Insurancematernity benefit by providing that a fixed proportion of it,eay one half,, was withheld until evidence was given of attendancef/
 of  a midwife  or doctor on  confinement,,   This  implias disburse meat   of a large sum of money annually in fees to i individuals without the control and  guarantees  implied in a local authority provision.    Would  it not be  possible to secure the tfonsent of the  Axoproved Societies to an arrangement whereby schemes of service provided  by the local  authoritiesand approved by the Central departments were subsidised,So go, by some  such method  as block grants from Insurance Fundson  condition that- certain  benefits would bs given free of charge to insured women and the wives of insured men?   Anarrangement of that kind would, no doubt P be acceptable tolocal authorities in Scotland and would ensure a  concentration of  resources in the solution of health problems, connected withmaternity.   The development of hospital and ancillary services for maternity, for which the need has long been apparent InScotland , would thereby be hastened.   Further consideration might be given to this aspect of the problem^                                           WM, AIJAMSQ1T,Sottish Office,   Fait shall, 8cW!o-2nd September, 19300
