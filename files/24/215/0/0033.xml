     [This Document is the Property  oi His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government]                      Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1930.                    ^SECRET.CP. 333 (30).                       CABINET.NORTH-WEST FRONTIER :  The Afridi Situation.   The subjoined telegrams exchanged  with the Government of India  are circulatedby the  Secretary  of  State  for  India,  for  information  with reference  to  cabinet conclusions  of  2nd  October  (Cabinet 58 (30),  conclusion  5)  and  9th  October(Cabinet 59 (30), conclusion 3).    From Secretary of State for India to Government of India, 2nd October 1930.   3143.  Foreign and Political Department.  Afridis.  Matter was finally consideredby Cabinet  to-day, and  they were  unable to accept your proposals.   They decidedthat the best course was  (a) to summon the Afridis  and treat the  construction of theroads and posts as one of the subjects for  negotiation which must be insisted  upon ;and (b) that,  if  the negotiations were not successful, no military action should be taken without a decision from the Cabinet.   2. This  decision  means  that Pears should summon the Afridi jirga and discuss with them all matters in dispute, treating the construction of the roads and posts as asine qua non of any settlement.   3. Decision (6) means that there is no present guarantee that it would be possibleto enforce  by  arms  the sine  qua non in regard  to roads  and  posts.  Pears may,therefore, prefer, at the moment, not to commit Government too deeply to the making of the roads and  posts,  and after hearing  what the jirga has  to say, to reserve theGovernments decision and  inform  them that they will be summoned to hear  it at alater date.                                                                         m From Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary  of  State                            for India, 3rd October 1930.   333 6 S.   Your 3143.   Afridis.  We feel that the use of  the word &quot;punitive &quot;inour earlier  telegrams may have misled you.   It  is  true, no doubt, that  we thinkpunishment  of Afridis  necessary,  but nothing could be  less like &quot; Tirah punitiveexpedition &quot;  than  the proposals which we  have submitted.   Our  troops are only to advance a few miles across the open plain.  It rests entirely with the Afridis whetheror not to offer opposition and, if they do, they will  do so on ground favourable to us.:In the event of opposition, any action which may be required against the sectionsinaccessible by ground can be  taken by air, and we see no reason to anticipate our troops being drawn into the hills or ourselves entangled in  serious commitments.  Wethink that show of force  is best means of preventing any serious attempt at opposition and may make Afridis amenable to  reason.  But  without this show, we anticipatevery dangerous reactions.   2. Reasons  for which we consider punishment  of Afridis necessary are various.We need vindication  of our prestige, not only at Kabul vide MaconachiVs telegram139* but also throughout India, where Afridi  incursions  created  most damagingimpression.   And there is another aspect which is even more importaut, viz., reactionon frontier generally, to  which  we will revert below.   3. As you will have seen from the situation reports, Afridis are in most  arrogantmood, and if Pears  has to  meet their jirga it has  already&apos; been  summoned  for7th October Avithout any dplinite  and firm programme  of Governments intentions,he will be placed in  impossible position.   Afridis will perceive that the  initiative still remains with them, and instead of their offering excuses for their conduct or discussingany demand on our   part, however  reasonable, they will  be encouraged to maintain arecalcitrant attitude   and to put forward the most  preposterous demands.   We havealready suggested that Pears should  have a free hand in dealing with  the jirga.   If                                    * Not printed.      4S45    75 10.30
this is given him, we think it by no-means  impossible  that  the matter of the BaraRoad  may be settled by consent, provided that the tribes are  left in no doubt as tothe Government being  in earnest.   Without  that,  the meeting  is bound to beinconclusive and unsatisfactory.    4.  Our proposals  were submitted  as the very least that could be done, after-schemes for very much more drastic action, for which there was ample justificationand strong arguments of expediency,  had been discussed and reluctantly discarded.We beg you once  again  to examine our previous telegrams and see how very modestour programme is.  It involves nothing to be  achieved by military means beyondadvance of an adequately  equipped force across the Khajuri Plain and construction ofthe road behind them.  Remainder of the road construction programme depends ontribal attitude and will be carried out by negotiation.    5.  We  are  convinced  that, unless  the present moment,  which  is opportune, isseized for action which,  however moderate, demonstrates to all concerned that  theinitiative  is  now with us, we  shall be faced with the very tribal trouble not oniy onAfridi border, but elsewhere as soon as season.begins to tell in tribes&apos; favour.    6. We  beg you, therefore,  with  all seriousness at our command, to take  matter under consideration once again,  and  allow us  to take  course of  action  which werecommend after mature consideration.   We trust that you will be able to let us haveorders by Gth October for communication to Pears before  his jirga on 7th.  From Szcretary of State for  India, to Government of India, Foreign and Political                          Department, 4:th October 1930.    3167.   His  Majesty&apos;s  Government have carefully  considered  your  telegram,3rd October, 3316 S., and  are impressed  by the considerations  you adduce,  butthey wish to make  it  clear once  more that they are definitely opposed to measures designed to &quot;make an example&quot;  of the Afridi  tribe as a whole, and even particularsections of it,  as a retribution for  past  misdeeds.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government are willing to agree to making the construction  of  the roads and  posts on the Plain  anessential demand at the jirga.   They regard this as a sufficient assertion of prestige and authority,  but  they are  equally  desirous of  achieving this without disturbanceand therefore wish any other action against the Afridislo be regarded as non-essential,such as* denial  of grazing rights, flying over their territory, &amp;c.  Pears should havea free hand at the  jirga, but his objective  should be to secure the road peacefully.The Government would be willing to permit him to advance troops for this end if itis essential for  the  objects stated, and he can enter the jirga with this knowledge inhis mind.      From Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary                       of Stale for India, 5th October 1930.    3345 S.   Our telegram  of  5th October, 469 K.   Following telegram No. 3344 S,has to-day been sent  to North-West Frontier, repeated to Baluchistan  and NorthernCommand, Rawalpindi:     &quot;  Afridis.   You are now fully informed as to attitude  of His Majesty&apos;s Government.They regard your plan of this construction on Khajuri and  Aka Khel Plains, to beheld  by posts if necessary, as sine qua non, and you  have authority to advance troops for this end if you  cannot secure this without.    &quot; You should therefore proceed as follows : (1) As regards Afridis in Government service, action should betaken according to plan ; (2) as  regards tribe, no effort should be spared  to  secure  attendance  of  all  who can speak as  representatives of theirsections.   You may deal  with  them sectionally or otherwise, and employ7 such tactics as you see fit.  Government  relies upon you to  use your best endeavours to secure- sine  qua non by consent.    &quot; If there are  any representations  which you wish to make please do so without delay.    &quot; Please keep Government of India promptly fully informed as to progress of your dealings with  tribe.&quot;    Further  communication  will  be sent  shortly containing our  observations with regard to such action as may be necessary under Article  XI of Treaty.    Addressed  Kabul,  470 K, and repeated to Secretary of State for India.
