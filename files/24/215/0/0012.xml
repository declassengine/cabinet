BHITANK10S S-07SR1SEC RET.Copy Ho3 * 10 O iCP. 312 (30).CAB I N E T.THE DRA1&quot;J? &quot;STATUTE 0? WESTMINSTER&quot;MEMORilTDUM BY THE ATT0RMEY-GEHEHA1(Propsered in accordance with Cabinet 51 (30),. Conclusion 1 (c)),        If the Statute  of Westminster were to be passed in   its present form,  it would confirm and strengthen a   contention, which  might be raised by any Dominion to-day,   that Croat 3ritain had no right  to confer Dominion status   on any fresh territory without the concent of all the   other Dominions.^        The argument  which could  be presented would be as   follows:-            ,:We are all partners  in a common enterprise,        We have certain obligations to each other,  ac, for        instance,  the obligation  of consultation.  v/e have        (or shall  have  when the Statute of Westminster is        passed) certain limitations imposed upon us        constitutionally in relation to laws touching the        succession to the Throne  which require the  assent        of ail the other partners,   This being so,  no one        partner can  of  his own volition introduce a new        partner without the consent of all the others,        since such an introduction will increase our        obligations  and may affect our constitutional        position.&quot;        On the one hand, it may be considered desirable to   face this difficulty fairly and squarely at the  present   time.  It should have been faced in 1926-.  It is                         -1-
unlikely that the passage of time will maice it easier to deal with,      On the other hand, it may be thought that thedifficulties of today&apos;s situation are so great as tomake it desirable to postpoxie this question, merelytaking care to see that the Statute of Westminster, in whatever form it be passed, does not present theDominions with any argument other than those they possessto-day.   If this latter view were adopted, it wouldprobably be sufficient to alter Clause 2 by striking outthe words &quot;and in every Act passed after the commencementof this Act&quot;.   The definition would then be applicableto &quot;this Act&quot; only.   If the Statute were drafted inthis form, the point at issue would be obscured for thetime being, though this will probably give rise to mis-apprehension in India, where it would be thought that thefirst and third recitals would have the effect of stereo-typing the existing membership.   In this case the obscuritywould have to be cleared up, and the whole matter investi-gated.      If this solution is to be adopted I should desirean opportunity of consulting with the Parliamentary draughtsman to see if some modification of these recitals could notbe introduced, though this cotirse might involve a radicalalteration in the structure of the Act,      The other course is to face up to the difficulty atthe present time rather than to endeavour to conceal its existence.      I strongly advocate this course, for if the doctrineis once established that the consent of the existing
Dominions is necessary before a nev. Dominion can boconstituted., it would follow that thoy have a voice onthis question which would justify them in putting pressure upon us to grant Dominion status, e.g. to India, or torefuse to oonsent to our so doing.   They would have this power unaccompanied by any responsibility.     If this course bo followed, I should suggest thatperfectly clear words bo put into the Statute to record theright of this country to admit to Dominion status suchterritory as seems proper to her without the necessity ofobtaining the consent of the other Dominions.   It is, Ithink, desirable to use general words and to avoid aroforence to India by name as this might ereato hopes whichcould not be fulfilled.     To oarry out this object, I suggest either that a new clause be inserted in the Statute upon the following lines -          &quot;It is hereby declared that notwithstanding     anything in this Act the Parliament of the United     kingdom has power to confer the status of a Dominion     upon any territory not having that status at the     commencement of this Act&quot;,or at least that tho principle embodied In these words be declared by some resolution passed at the Imperial Conference      &quot;Whatever course may be decided upon, I should prefer to restrict the definition of Dominion to &quot;this Act&quot;.                            (Intd.)  W,A.J.Boyal Courts of Justice,       September 23rd,  1930.
