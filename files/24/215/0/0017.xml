TRADE,                  ECONOMIC SECRETARTAT, ETC.          On the eve of the Imperial Conference the General Cornellof the Trades Union Congress and the Federation of BritishIndustries desire jointly to place upon record the paramount importance which they attach to all possible  steps being takento increase inter-Commonwealth trade..   They consider that theImperial Conference offers an opportunity which,  if missed, maynot soon, recur for placing the economic life  of the Commonwealthupon a sound and. enduring basis,        -  The economic possibilities of the British Commonwealthare enormous.   There is already the tie of sentiment and commontraditions, which although intangible is of real value.   Withinthe Commonwealth are to be found both man-power,  vast sources of raw material and food,  and large territories capable ofdevelopment.   Great as is the exchange of  goods and services at present between the United Kingdom and the Dominions and colonies,  the Commonwealth,  if intensively  developed,  could vastlyincrease the total of its  trade, with advantage to each of its constituent ports.          The policy necessary to obtain a  greater measure ofeconomic development within the Commonwealth  presents many different aspects, but there is one point ox  overwhelmingimportance, to which at this juncture the Trades Union congress and the Federation of British Industries wish to direct thespecial attention of Kis Majesty&apos;s Government in the hope that a
serious effort may &quot;be made to deal with tho question at theforthcoming Conference, namely, the necessity for adequatemachinery for economic consultation between the various ports of the Commonwealths   Unless such machinery can be set up,a proper Investigation of the various problems cannot beachieved, and the Governments of the Empire will not have a sound conception of the economic considerations involved or the detailed knowledge to guide their policy,    At the presentmoment, better machinery exltets, in the shape of the economic organisation of the League of Nations,  for the discussion ofeconomic questions between this country and foreign countriesthan exist for the purpose of considering  Commonwealth economic problem So          The Federation of British Industries and the TradesUnion Congress therefore urge that the  most important taskbefore the Imperial Conference is to devise machinery which will permit of the discussion and formulation  of a constructiveCommonwealth trade policy, and facilitate  its practical application^          The Federation of British Industries and the TradesUnion Congress are in agreement that the creation of machineryupon the following general lines is desirable:-       LA      That at as early a date  as  possible a Commonwealth          Trade Conference should be held  of an investigatory,          advisors^, and non-party nature,  of persons nominated          by each Government of the Empire, but acting in their          personal capacity,  composed as follows:-             (a)-  One or more chief Government officials concerned                  with economic and trade  questions;             (b)  Representatives of industry and agriculture,                  both employers and employed;             (c)  Representatives of commerce,  finance, and                  shipping.      2.       The scope of this Conference to be:-
               (a)   To  examine  the  problem  of  inter-Commonwealth                    trade  with  a  view  to  laying  down a  sound basis                    for a  Commonwealth Economic  policy.                        At  this  Conference every  question affecting                    inter-Commonwealth trade should be  brought under                    review.     In particular an  effort  should be made                    to  ascertain  definitely the  views of the                    Dominions as  to what  further reciprocal arrange-                    ments  it may  be possible to  make for increasing                    int er-CommonweaIth trade.                        A clear  statement  of  Dominion  views on that                    point  would enable the  question to  be considered                    as  a whole;                (b)  This Conference further to consider the mass of                    detailed questions entering  into Commonwealth                    trade  relations, with a view to drawing up an                    Agenda for  discussion at the next succeeding                    Imperial Conference,  having  due regard to the                    relative importance of  the questions raised; the                    Conference  to express its  views and suggestions                    with regard to  the subjects  forming part of such                    an  Agenda;                (c)  The Conference  to  be  investigatory  in character,                    and to act  as a medium  for forming  constructive                    proposals on  which the  Governments  would                    deliberate  and  take their  decisions.          This Conference  would be  for the  Commonwealth what theWorld Economic Conference  at Geneva was for the  world at large,but it should be far more  productive of results, and would go far to remedy the defects in organisation  which at&quot;present  handicapus in inter-Commonwealth relations.
It should not he a spasmodic effort hut a permanentpart of the Commonwealth economic machinery, and should inparticular meet before each succeeding Imperial Conference,in order to study and submit its views upon the problemsawaiting solution.          In addition to the establishment of such commonwealth trade Conferences, the Trades Union Congress and the Federationof British Industries suggests-       30    That a Commonwealth Economic Secretariat should be            established,  formed of persons with economic and            administrative experience, drawn from all parts            of the Commonwealth, to act as a-permanent            Secretariat for all Imperial Conferences on economic            questions.   The duty of this Secretariat would            be to watch and report upon the steps taken between            Conferences to give effect . to decisions arrived at,            and to study both questions raised at the preceding            Conference and any questions which might arise in            the intervals                  If such a system were established, it would            give the Commonwealth an adequate machinery, which            to-day it does not possess, for dealing with            problems of vital Importance.                  The Federation of British Industries and the            Trades Union Congress cannot too strongly impress            upon His Majesty&apos;s Government the importance they            attach to the setting up of Commonwealth economic            machinery on the lines proposed,  FOR THE K-1DERATI0N OF BRITISI]      FOR THE GENERAL COUNCIL OF       INDUSTRIES&apos;.  &apos;                 THE TRADES UNION CONGRESS.(Sgd.)
