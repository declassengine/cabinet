October 1930.SECRET.CP. 350(30).                       CABINET.NORTH-WEST  FRONTIER:  The Afridi Situation.    The following telegrams received  from the Government of India are circulated &quot;bythe Secretary of State for India for information in  continuation of  those contained in cp. 345 (30).    The Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province, in the exercise of the discretion accorded him and in the hope that a jirga would still  come ia, deferred till17th October initiation of measures  for  the construction of  the two approved  roadsacross the Khajuri  Plain.  Finding,  however,  that, despite the last-hour messagesreceived from certain sections, there  was no sign of any real intention on  the part ofthe Afridis to send in a representative jirga, he authorised the Northern Command  tomove forward troops on  the morning of  17th October to cover  road construction, in execution of the plan already approved.    Later reports indicate that troops moved 7 miles out from Bara Fort, encounteringno opposition, and that a jirga of certain Afridi maliks  and  elders  (it is not clear  towhat  extent  it is  a representative gathering-  or whether it is different from thatmentioned in telegram 3473 S. below) met the  Assistant Political Officer  at Jamrudon  19th October.    20th October 1930.  From Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State                           for India, IQth October 1930.                            (Repeated to Kabid, 574 K.)   3467 S.   Your 3280, 14th October.  Afridis.   Chief Commissioner has postponedzero day to 17th October, as there are some indications  of jirga coining in. From Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State                           for India, 17th October 1930.   3473 S.  The following is North-West Frontier Province telegram of 17th October,276 L.  Telegram was apparently drafted evening of  16th, but  despatched morning of 17th :-   &quot; Letter  dated 15th October was  received to-day  from Afridi Maliks  and somepro-Government  elders.   Malikdin Khel  Malik  was  not  among the  signatures.Letter was written from  Upper Bara Valley and  says  that intention of jirga was toreach Jamrud to-morrow morning.  Against this, there is the fact that no informationwhatever  has been  received yet  (S p.in.) at Shahgai in Khy ber of any jirga havingreached  Bazar Valley or Chora,  to which  places Afridi  pensioned officers wentyesterday to  meet jirga.   Air Force  reconnaissance at  mid-day to-day  reportedpresence of about 700 men at Sher  Khel in  Aka Khel  limits  in Bara Valley.   Theywere  not moving towards  Khajuri,  but were  carrying out some form of drill inthe open.   Aka Khel jirga was seen at -famrud to-day by Assistant Political Officer, and also for short time by Political Agent.   They attempted to justify their first attack of june last by excitement over April riots in  Peshawar City.   They had no other justification for August attacks, and said they would defer reply until arrival of full jirga.    Under these  circumstances,  I  consider  objections to further  postponement  of advance to be overwhelming, and  have  asked Northern Command to  order andvance for to-morrow morning.&quot;4862B    75  10.30
