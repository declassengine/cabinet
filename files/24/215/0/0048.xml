The  King&apos;s Speech on the  Opening of Parliament.OCTOBER 28, 1930.MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF  THE HOUSE OF COMMONS :    IT has given Me much pleasure to receive  My Ministers from the Dominionsand the Representatives of India who are attending  the Imperial Conference.   Iwatch with deep  interest the progress of  their labours, the satisfactory  result ofwhich I shall confidently await.    I hope soon to welcome the Representatives of the Princes and Peoples of Indiawho are about to join with members of all  Parties in  both Houses of Parliament toconsider the future constitutional position  of India.    My intention is to inaugurate this Conference, and I earnestly trust that in theconclusion of  its  proceedings may  be  found agreed  and  wise solutions of thoseimportant questions upon which it will be called  to deliberate.    My relations with Foreign Powers continue  to be  friendly.    I was very glad to entrust  My  Son, the Duke of  Gloucester, with the duty of representing Me at the coronation of the Emperor of Ethiopia.    My Government took an active  part in the  proceedings of  the Assembly of theLeague of Nations in September last.   General agreement was  reached upon theTreaty of Financial Assistance to States Victims of Aggression which was recentlysigned at Geneva.  The application of this Treaty is conditional upon the coming intoforce of a General Disarmament Convention, which I trust will shortly be concluded.MEMBERS  OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS :    Estimates for the Public Service will be laid before you.MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF  COMMONS :    I follow with grave concern and sympathy the continuance of heavy unemploy-ment among so many of My People.    Economic depression unfortunately continues to dominate the  markets of theworld and the accompanying restriction of international trade is felt with particularseverity in those industries which are especially dependent on export.    My Government will persist in its efforts to develop and extend home, imperial and foreign trade and to help in measures which will lead to greater efficiency in industry.    Proposals will be  laid before you for the promotion of increased settlement andemployment on the  land,  and of  large-scale  farming  operations,  and  for theacquisition and improvement of agricultural land in need of re-conditioning; and forthe organisation of producers for marketing purposes.    I propose immediately to set up a Commission to  enquire into the whole questionof Unemployment Insurance and in particular into  the allegations of abuse of its provisions.  The Commission will be asked  to present interim Reports on the most pressing questions and, if required, legislation based upon them will be introduced.In  the meantime  a  measure  to make  further   financial  provision  for  theUnemployment Fund will be laid before you.
    My Ministers propose to introduce legislation to secure for the  community its share in the site value of land.    Measures will be submitted to you for raising the Age of Compulsory school attendance, for amending the law relating to Trade Disputes and  Trade Unions,and for the setting up of a Consumers&apos; Council.    My Ministers propose to introduce legislation for the modification and extensionof the Law relating to town planning and to the  preservation of rural amenities;and for the amendment and consolidation of  the Factory Acts.    A Measure of Electoral Reform will be submitted to  you.    Bills will also be laid before you to enable the ratification of the &quot;WashingtonHours Convention and of the International Convention for the  Safety of Life at sea and for the establishment of a new statutory authority to deal with passenger traffic in London.    I pray that,  under the blessing of God, the outcome of your  deliberations mayadvance the happiness and well-being of My people.
