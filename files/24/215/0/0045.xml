The subjoined telegrams exchanged with the Government of India are circulatedby the Secretary of State fofTridia, !for information.iinfcontinuation:of CR. 333...(30).::      From Secretary of State to Government of India, dated 10th October 1930.   3246.  Foreign  and  Political Department.  My telegram  8th October, No^ 3228.Afridis&apos;.  Somewhat misleading accounts of Governments policy  av&amp;l appearing in press here and even in the Times.                             1       -  ;   .    .-.  ,   Please telegraph present position as regards Afridi jirga.  If Airidis  decline tocome in,  how does  this  affect  the situation ?   What are  you  doing  as regardspublication  of commuhique  or  supply of other  information to the Press?  Therewould be advantages in early official statement1 in order to counteract Press reports.  From Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State                           for India, 11th October 1930.;:               t.  o;,--i   3411 S.   Your  telegram No: 3246, which has  been repeated to Kabul and North-West Frontier under our. No. 3510 S.: of 11th October.        . , ..;  &apos;h .   - .   2. All correspondence has been repeated to Minister, including draft communique(sent under  our No. 3377 S. of 8th October) and he is presumably no longer &quot;in doubt as to objectives sanctioned.   So far as  Afridis are concerned, posts and roads are sinequa  non,  but until ground has  been examined we  cannot say what  posts  will heactually necessary for protection of roads or even whether any will be required at all.   3. We  entirely agree as to complete  frankness  and would therefore prefer thatMaconachie be authorised to refer orally at earliest possible opportunity to  subsidiaryproject mentioned in  para. No. 5  of our No. 3319  S.,  but  written communicationrequired by Article XI should not be delayed for decision on this point.   4. We agree with Maconachie as to omission of reference to interference of Afridisin affairs of British India,  but in view of language held  by Shah Wali to  Baggalleyabout conquest of Tirah, we see no  reason why Minister should not also mention itand  we think that Nadir would like to be assured on  this point.   However, we  arecontent to rely on his discretion.    5. As you will have seen from situation reports, Afridi jirga has not yet come in,and their present attitude seems to make it doubtful whether they mean to come.    If in  spite of  ample  notice which they have received,  they  do not come  in, it would appear that they are engaging in  deliberate  procrastination, which inference derives strong support from nature of  terms which they are reported to  be demanding of the Government.  In these circumstances we consider that  we should  proceed according to plan and set about examination of Khajuri  Plain  to  determine the alignment of the roads on  the day originally fixed, viz., 15th October.   If, however, Chief Commissioner has any reason to believe that he can get a representative jirga in by extending few days&apos; further grace,  we authorise him to exercise  his discretion in this sense in consultation with Northern Command to extent of postponing zero day for not more than five days.   He should keep us closely informed.     6. Principal object  of  such postponement would be to avoid any charges against Government of hasty action which  might  diminish  the hopes of reaching agreement with the Afridis, but in view of the failure of the  Afridis to come in, and the pressure they are  reported  to be exerting on all sections to give precedent pledges against      4862    75  10.30
any variation of their own suggested terms, we do not attach great importance to theadvantages of, and  on the other hand, see considerable disadvantages in  delay.  Inany case, Chief Commissioner should make Government position and intentions knownby every means in his power, including presentation of his statement of  the case andour communique  to the Afridis  of any sections who do come in,  and  also,  if he thinks fit, disseminate leaflets by aeroplane.   7. As regards publication of communique, it  seems imperative that Maconachie&apos;sintimation  should be given  before  communique  appears  in  the Press.   We  think,therefore, that he should give his intimation at once, and that the communique shouldbe released for publication in the morning papers of Monday, 13th October.  We arearranging accordingly.   We are also making some alterations in the communique inthe light of  remarks since it was  drafted.   We  will telegraph these separately, butthey are not of great consequence.   8. This telegram was drafted before the receipt  of Forminka 64, but we have noalterations to make.   Addressed to Secretary of State and repeated to Kabul, 497 K., North-West frontier and Northern Command.  From Secretary of State to Government of India,  Foreign and Political Department,                                14th October 1930.   3280.  Your telegram 11th  October,  3411 S.   I agree that we should proceedaccording to plan subject to discretion of  Chief Commissioner to postpone zero day if by this means he can secure what is the chief objective,mamely, the making of tworoads in the Kajuri Plain by agreement.   2. Your  telegram 6th October,  3319 S.,  para.  5.   Have you  yet received thefurther information for which you asked  Pears in connection with subsidiary schemesdescribed in paras. 9 and 10 of his Express Letter  No. 132 L. ?
