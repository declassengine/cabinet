MEMORANDUM BY THE PRESIDENT On&apos; THE BOARD Of TRADE.                I have prepared  the following memorandum in accordance          with  the decision of  the Cabinet on September 17th          ^/Conclusions 52 (30)  l/.             1. One of the most important things the Imperial Conference          could do would be to  set up an 1 nter-ImperiaJU-organisation for          the continuance examination of inter-Imperial questions and,          it is to be hoped, their progressive solution.  It is almost          impossible to  settle  big or detailed questions if they are          considered only at Imperial Conferences held at intervals of          three or four years,  and if the only arrangement for their          consideration in between iE by means of the cable.  There is          already an Economic organisation, which will be sketched          below, but this organisation  is scrappy and not coordinated.          The whole field of potslble work is by no means covered.          moreover, there is no common  Secretariat to bind the organisa-          tion  together.  However, in the existing organisation a          beginning has been made and it is to be hoped that it will be          possible to make real progress in its development and so          facilitate the promotion of inter-Imperial trade In every          possible way.  The experience of the League of nations has          shown that without adequate and well organised machinery there          is little chance of satisfactorily settling problems affecting          more  than one country.                           Existing Economic machinery.              2. i^he  existing economic  macninery is as follows: -                  Imperial Conferences  are held approximately every                three or four years at  whioh economic questions as1-
\9                                                       g    228                 well as other questions  are discussed,  at  these                 Conferences, among other things, the work of certain                 Imperial Committees io considered.  The following                 are the chief of the bodiee which exist.*                   (a) The -Imperial Economic Committee set  up in 1925                        after the Imperial Conference in 1923.  This                        has extremely limited terms  of reference, which                        relate solely to  enquiries into the  marketing                        of Dominion foodetuf f s  and certain raw materials                        in the United kingdom and allow of the prepara-                        tion of certain trade reports.                   (b) The Imperial Shipping Committee reports on                        questions of  hipping faoilitiea within the                        Empire which are  referred  to them by any part                        of the Empire with the  concent or the other                        parts, and deals  with complaints.                   (c) The Executive Council of the  Imperial Agricultural                        Research Bureaux  controls  and directs eight                        research bureaux set up as a result  of the                        Imperial Agricultural Research Conference ef                        1927.                   (d) The Advisory Committee on Cables and  Wireless                        Communications exercises certain powers of                        supervision and control over the operations of                        the Cable and Wireless  merger Companlvs.                   (e) The Oversea Mechanical Transport Council Is                        engaged In investigating the possibllitios of                        developing transport where there are inadequate                        railways or roads.              The above bodies report to  each of the Governments of the         Empire.            3. There are in addition the  following which are notbrief statement ot the  constitution and work of these and other bodies and how they are financed is contained in the appendix to thismemorandum.
                                                     -     221strictly constituted on ah Imperial basis, but are oonoernedwith matters of Imperial interest:-                         \     (f) The Empire marketing Board is financed by tho British          Government and is engaged in promoting the sale of          Empire produce in the United kingdom.  It contains   /          Dominion and Indian representatives and is advisory, ^          the responsibility for expenditure out of the Empire  ^          -marketing Fund resting with the United kingdom          Government.     (g) The Imperial Institute is controlled by the Department          of Overseas Trade, though there is an Imperial Council          in connection with it.   4. Although there is here a nucleus, it is evident that thereis need of development and coordination if a determined effort is to be made to develop inter-Imperia 1. economic cooperation ona wider basis in the interest of all parts of the Empire.                    The  ew Organisation Suggested.A. Annual Meeting of ministers.      5. The first and moet essential thing is that ministers with   authority to speak for their Governments in matters relating to   commerce and industry who come to the League of Nations Assembly   each year should meet in London as an Imperial ministerial body   (l) to consider the work done in the previous twelve months by   the new economic machinery, (8) to determine the lines of work   for the forthcoming year, and (3) to discuss generally any   questlpn relating to inter-Imperial economic relations.  It will   be understood, of course, that they could not commit their   Governments to final decisions on the more important questions   of policy which must always be left to the individual Governments.   But such final decisions on policy are not entailed in the   furtherance of enquiries and preparation of reports leading up   to ultimate recommendations for the adoption of Governments ifVMV (7  4- .***W ********   Jf* W V W -B.An Imperial Secretariat;      6. This annual;meeting of Ministers,  however,  in itself

There   Is required in addition some  standing organisation including a   Secretariat, the constitution of which  is  discussed later.0. A new Economic Commit top.      7. For the rest, it is  obvious  that  the great defect at   the present time is that there  is  no Committee which  is (a)   coordinating the inter-Imperial work that  is bejng done)   preventing overlapping and considering  the filling in of  gaps,   and (b)  empowered to examine  any of the larger  ou.eetj one   connected with industry and trade  of an Imperial character   which, in the interests of the  Empire,  it  is desirable to have   explored.   The existing Imperial  Economic Committee  has  no   concern with the other existing Committees and has extremely   limited terms of reference.   In my opinion it is essential,   therefore, to set up a body which  I shall  refer to in this   memorandum as the New Economic  Committee.      8. The question will arise whether the  new Economic Committee   should take control of existing organisations in the  economic   field.   It should at least be  informed of the work being   done by the other-atnter-Imperial Committees, and it should  bo   part of its functions to advise the Annual Meeting of Ministers ^   on the -coordination of that work.   In  some cases, particularly   in the case of any new Committees, it would presumably control   their work, but practical  consideration may preclude  its  taking   over the control of some of the existing bodies.      9. The other section of the  work of  the New Economic   Committee, and, no doubt,  the most important, would be to take   over and extend the functions of the existing Economic Committee.   Under this heading it would keep in touch  with the progress   being made in the various  countries towards carrying  out  the   resolutions and recommendations of the  Imperial Conference;   it would examine any economic matter  of Imperial interest which   might be referred to it;  and would suggest to the Annual   Meeting of Ministers the directions in  which enquiry  might
profitably be pursued.    It might,  for example,  consider thepolicy embodied in the Empire Marketing Board and the  feasibility of applying that policy within other parts of the Empire with aview to Empire Marketing Boards being set up in  those  otherparts.   It might also be empowered to take action on  mattersnot involving decisions on questions of policy (which  would be reserved for the Annual Meetings of Ministers),  as,  for example,the arrangement of conferences of business people of different parts of the Empire for the direct solution by business interestsof Imperial trade problems.   10. In the conduct of this part of its work,  the Committeeshould have authority to set up Sub-Committees for specialenquiries, to confer with business interests and, in short, todo all things necessary to prepare the ground for Governmentaldecisions, or for direct contributions by business men throughoutthe Empire to the promotion of inter-Imperial economic relations.The Committee would report its action to the Annual Meetings ofMinisters and receive authority from that body to any  procedurethat they contemxDlated, such as the setting up of specialcommittees or the institution of missions for enquiry.   11. If such a new Economic Committee were set up, it would,no doubt, become a common practice to leave it to work out thedetails of many questions discussed in general terms by theImperial Conference, to refer to it, for preparatory work,matters tentatively raised for the first time, and to  instructit to follow and report on action taken under the variousConference resolutions adopted.   12. There are several questions which might be referred toit by the present Conference.   For example, among the largerquestions which could be so referred there is the proposal ofwhat has been called in the memorandum E.-5. (B) (30) 1 * the rationalisation of industries on an Imperial basis&apos;.   The
 Economic- -Oo^ganis^trLon might usefully  be  instructed  to explore the possibilities  of this line of  action,  and  in connection with It get Into  touch with  business  interests.    139  It might  be  thought that  bulk  purhcase was another suoh question, but  probably, in view  of Its magnitude and complexity, it  would not be  wise  to refer  it as a whole  to  the  Eoonomlo Organisation now, though  the application of  the general idea In special  directions might  be proposed  for enquiry.   The bulk purchase idea  in its  relation  to staple  food produots and possibly raw materials  so profoundly affects the  economy of  the United Kingdom  that very oareful consideration  by Ministers would be necessary before any  deoision  was taken, even to refer it to an Imperial body  for examination.    14. In this connection the  Cabinet&apos;s  deoision-must be bcrne inmind  that no such scheme oould be adopted unless it were established primarily in the interests of  the United Kingdom, which would seom to  Imply (a) that prices to the  consumer should not thereby be increased and  (b) that the prices realised should nevertheless be sufficient oo  to ,oover all costs  as to ensure that  there should beno  burden on the  tax-payer.    It would appear to follow (o) that the body entrusted with the bulk purchasing  would have to buy in the most efficient commercial  manner, that is in the cheapestmarkets  at the most suitable times, subject  to  adjusting its operations in  such a manner as to ensure a market for all homeproduce  tendered for sale.  Also  (d) It  would presumably berequisite that due regard should be paid to  the importance of retaining export markets suoh  as the Argentine.  The observanoe ofthese desiderata would stand in the way  of agreeing to a stabilisedprice for Dominion producers whioh would be  acceptable to them,though it might  conceivably be consistent with  choosing firstDominion produce, other things being equal from the point of viewof  the United Kingdom;  but this condition would probably so limit
 the preference thus accorded that It would have little or no attractions to the Dominions,   Whether such stringent conditions would have to be applied in the oase of the less important commodities, such as dried fruits and tinned salmon,  Is perhaps anatter for consideration.    15* If, then, bulk purchase as a whole is not referred to the new Economic Committee but it Is desired that some start should be made In tho exploration of the general idea, it might be possible to instruct the Economic Committee to examine the possibilities of applying the prinoiple to a striotly limited list of commodities other than staple food and raw material products, whether by bulk purchase or any other organisation of marketing  machinery which would secure that a larger proportion of the overseas output was consumed within the Empire.    16 * A glance at the Agenda of the Conference will show that there are several other matters that might well be passed to the nww Economic Committee, particularly as no great delay would be Involved if there were to be a meeting of Ministers 12 months hence.             Constitution^ of the Eopnomjlo Organisation.    17. Having examined above the functions of the Economic Organisation, it remains to oonsider tho constitution of the new bodies that are proposed,    18. There is first the Secretariat.  It would be an immense advantage If this Secretariat were an Imperial one, as this would prevent suspicion that the maohinery was being worked mainly in the interests of the United Kingdom.  It would probably be sufficient at the eutBet if it were constituted of one offioial from each part of the Empire *   No very large staff would be required at first.  It would serve, of oourse, as the Secretariat of the annual meeting of Ministers, being supplemented for that purpose by the maohinery wUoh is now used for Imperial Gonferenoes; and at the time of Imperial Conferences it oould be incorporated into the secretarial machinery used for the Conference.
   19. The new Economic Committee should he an extremely important body, and it would therefore have to he carefullyconstituted.   There is a lot to he said for kee-ping it small,and in this event it should contain only one representative each important part of the Empire.   This would make  a &quot;bodyof not more than ten.   The representative of each part should&quot;be a person who will command the confidence of the Government  whom he represents and should at the same time &quot;be capable of makinga real contribution to the work of the Committee.   It might beobjected that so small a Committee could never get through its work, but it is contemplated that it should function throughsub-committees and that it should have the power of co-optingmembers for those sub-committees or for other special purposes;so that, for instance, officials with a special knowledge of any matter being enquired into could be drawn into the work, or business people within whose sphere of interest the subject lay.   80. There remains the question of the Chairman.   Thepresent Imperial Economic Committee has a permanent Chairman(Sir H. Mackinder) who was appointed with the concurrence of allthe Governments represented at the Imperial Conference.   Thequestion, however, arises whether the time is not now ripe to let the Chair pass, it being held for a period by one part of  theEmpire and then by another part of the Empire.   In any case itis important to avoid any appearance of domination by theUnited Kingdom.   21. In connection with the constitution there is the questionwhere the organisation should have its seat.   No doubt it wouldbe convenient that the new Economic Committee and most of itssub-committees would sit as a rule in London, but it would bedesirable that when occasion arises they should travel to overseasparts of the Empire and hold meetings there, carrying with themsuch parts of the Secretariat as it may be necessary to take.
   32. In connection with the constitution there is alsoanother question of detail,  namely, whether some machinery would not have to develop overseas to work in connectionwith the bodies sitting in London, for instance, smalleconomic committees which might include marketing boardsif such boards came to be set up in other parts of the Empire.                    General Considerations.   33. This is only a very general outline of the line ofpolicy with which this memorandum is concerned.   Personally,I am hopeful that if effect could be given to it, we shouldhave started a new era in the development of Imperial economic policy.   No doubt in the course of discussion the ideas putforward here would undergo modification.   And it may be thatcertain of the Dominions would still object on the ground onwhich they previously objected, namely, that a developedorganisation of this character seated mainly in the UnitedKingdom savoured too much of centralised Imperial Government.This objection, I think, is based on a misapprehension, as there is nothing in these proposals to infringe the authorityof the overseas Governments.   Moreover, it may be that weshall find the objections weaker to-day after the decisionsarrived at at the 1926 Conference with regard to the status ofthe Dominions and after effect has been given to certain dfthese decisions at the present Conference.   It will be notedalso that ideas are thrown out above to meet these objections.such as the passing of the  Chairmanship of the Imperial EconomicCommittee, and the Imperial constitution of the Secretariat.   24. Finally, I have one suggestion to make, namely, thatwe should not place a cut and dried scheme on the table at theConference.   By proceeding in such a way we should probably beinviting a critical attitude,   I would suggest that a general discussion should be started on the development of Imperial                            -9-
economic machinery end that the representatives of theUnited Kingdom should so direct the discussion as to leadit, if possible, in the direction of the scheme outlined above, so that the scheme as eventually drafted would comespontaneously out of the discussion instead of being putforward by the United Kingdom.Board of Trade,    23rd September, 1930.W.G
