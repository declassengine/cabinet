THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1930,SECRET.CP. 301 (30).CABINET.COMMITTEE  ON POLICY IN PALESTINE.                                 REPORT.    AT  a Meeting of the Cabinet  on the 30th  July,  1930 (Cabinet 46  (30),Conclusion 11), the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum  by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (Paper CP. 278 (30)) relative to the Report of the permanent mandates Commission  on the  events which occurred in Palestine  in August and september  1929, and agreed,  inter alia, that a Cabinet  Committee composed  asfollows : &apos;        The Secretary of State for the Colonies,        The Chancellor &amp;i the Exchequer,        The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.        The Secretary of State for War,        The Secretary of State for Air should meet during the  Recess to consider the policy of the Government and the best way of handling the situation in regard to the application of the Balfoiir Note andthe Palestine Mandate.    The Committee now submit to the Cabinet, for consideration, a draft Statementof the Policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Palestine, together with a coveringNote by the Secretary of State for  the Colonies, drawing special attention to certain points in the draft Statement of  Policy.  (For these documents see Appendix I).Attention is also drawn  to a letter,  dated  the 18th August, 1930,  from Sir JohnHope Simpson  to  the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and to  Sir John HopeSimpson&apos;s  Report  on   his  Inquiry  into  Land  Settlement,  Development  and immigration in Palestine, copies of which will be found  in Appendix II.    The Committee recommend the Cabinet :         To approve the draft  Statement of Policy  in the form  set out  in        Appendix  I,   and  to  authorise  the publication  of  the  Statement        simultaneously with the publication of Sir J. Hope Simpson&apos;s Report.    The Committee have adopted  a suggestion of the Chancellor of the exchequer that a small Expert Committee  should be  appointed  to examine Sir  J.  HopeSimpson&apos;s settlement scheme, and  to advise as to  the manner  in  which financial provision  might best be  made  to give effect to the policy outlined  in  the  draft statement.  In the view  of the Committee the publication of the Statement  ofPolicy and the Simpson Report need not  await the findings  of this expert committee.                                   Signed on behalf of  the Committee,                                           PHILIP SNOWDEN (Chairman).    2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.        September 15, 1930.[21671a]
CONFIDENTIAL.APPENDIX I.       DKAFT STATEMENT OF THE  POLICY OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT                                IN PALESTINE.Note for the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on certain points in                  the accompanying Draft Statement of Policy.    IN connection with that part  of the draft  Statement of Policy relating to thequestion of constitutional development, it should be noted     1. The proposals for the new Legislative Council follow those for the Legislative           Council  proposed in 1922, with one important exception.  In the case           of the 1922  Council, all of the Unofficial Members were to be elected.           The Unofficial Members are also to be elected to the new Council in normal           circumstances, but it is proposed to  provide that they can be appointed,           if  necessary, otherwise than  by  election,  in  case  any section  of the           population attempts to  frustrate the endeavour to set up the Council by           boycotting the elections.    2. Article 84 of the Palestine Order-in-Council provides for the appointment of           a Committee consisting  of not less than one-half of the Unofficial Members           of the Legislative Council, to confer with the High Commissioner  upon           all matters relating to  the  regulation of immigration.  The provisions           of that Article take effect from and after the constitution of the Council,           and it will therefore be necessary to  amend the Article not later than the           date of  the establishment of  the Council, unless  the  machinery  there           provided for dealing with immigration is to be adopted.     It will be necessary for the High Commissioner to retain wide  powers  in regardto the control of immigration, but it may be thought expedient  not to depart fromthe 1922  Policy in  the  matter of the Immigration Committee of the LegislativeCouncil.   To do so  would lay His Majesty&apos;s Government  open to  a charge of inconsistency.   The Committee which will merely have the right  to confer withthe High Commissioner, with a reference of differences of opinion to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment may prove a useful &quot; safety valve.&quot;     The Section of the draft  dealing with Economic and Social Development  isbased largely on Sir John Hope Simpson&apos;s Report, but is  far from  being exhaustive.It has been thought simplest to follow, with as little paraphrasing as possible, the wording of those portions of his report which summarise his conclusions or expressconcisely  his findings on matters of  fact.  When the  Hope Simpson Report  is published, these resemblances in wording may be noticed, but this may not be thoughtobjectionable.   As  regards Sir John&apos;s recommendations,  an attempt has been madeto express some of  them in more general terms than those in which he has framedthem and to omit many details, so as to preserve a greater measure of  freedom to HisMajesty&apos;s  Government in the practical application of his  recommendations.     In view of the financial position of  Palestine,  it has been thought necessary toindicate, though in guarded terms, that some financial assistance from His Majesty&apos;s Government will be forthcoming.                                                                          P.     Colonial Office, September  11, 1930.
Draft  Statement of the Policy  of His Majesty&apos;s             Government in Palestine.   1.  THE Report  of  the  Special Commission, under  the Chair-manship of Sir  Walter Shaw, which was published in  April, has given rise  to acute  controversy in the course of which it became evident that there is considerable  misunderstanding about the pastactions  and  future  intentions  of  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  inregard to the administration of Palestine.  It was realised that thepublication of a clear  and full statement of policy, designed  toremove  such misunderstanding  and the resultant uncertainty andapprehension was a matter of  urgent  importance.   The  prepara-tion  of  such a  statement,  however,  necessitated certain  essential preliminary steps which have inevitably delayed its completion.   The Report of the  Shaw Commission  drew attention to certain features  of the  problem,  which, in the opinion of His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment, called  for prompt and  full  investigation, in  view  oftheir  important bearing  upon future  policy.    It was therefore decided  to send  to  Palestine  a  highly  qualified investigator(Sir  John  Hope Simpson) to confer  with  the High commissioner and  to report to His  Majesty&apos;s Government  on land settlement,immigration  and   development.     Owing   to   the  dominatingimportance of these  subjects,  and  their close inter-connection, HisMajesty&apos;s Government recognised that no statement of policy couldbe formulated without first  taking into account a full and  detailedexposition of the situation in Palestine under these three importantheads, such as  Sir  John Hope Simpson  was eminently  qualified to furnish.   Considerable  pressure  has been brought to  bear upon his  Majesty&apos;s  Government  to  anticipate  the  receipt  of  sir john Hope Simpson&apos;s Report by a declaration  of policy,  but,  whileappreciating the urgent need for as early a declaration as possible,His Majesty&apos;s Government  felt bound  to  adhere to their  decisionto await  the receipt of Sir John Hope Simpson&apos;s Report,  especiallyhaving regard to the evidence which was accumulating  as to theextreme  difficulty and  complexity of the problem and  the  needfor the fullest  investigation  of the  facts before arriving at any definite conclusions.   Sir John Hope Simpson&apos;s Report has  now been received, andthe present statement of policy has been framed after very carefulconsideration of its contents and  of  other  information  bearingupon the Palestine situation which has recently become  available.   2.  In  a  country such  as Palestine,  where  the interests andaims of two sections of the community are at present diverse andin some  respects conflicting, it is too much to expect  that any declaration of policy will fully satisfy the  aspirations  of either party.  His Majesty&apos;s Government have, however, permitted them-selves to hope that the removal of existing misunderstandings andthe more precise definition  of their intentions may  go far  to allayuneasiness  and to restore  confidence on both sides.   It will be theendeavour  of His Majesty&apos;s Government,  not  only  by the presentstatement of policy  but by the administrative actions which will result from it,  to  convince both Arabs  and Jews  of  their  firmintention to promote the essential interests of  both  races to theutmost of their  power, and to work consistently for  the  develop-ment,  in Palestine,  of a prosperous community,  living in  peaceunder an impartial and progressive Administration.   It is necessary,however,  to  emphasise one  important &apos;point, viz.,  that in the peculiar circumstances of  Palestine no policy,  however enlightenedor however vigorously prosecuted, can hope for success, unless itis supported  not merely  by  the  acceptance,  but by the willingco-operation of the communities for whose benefit it is designed.   It is  unnecessary here  to dwell  upon the unhappy  events  ofthe past year and  the deplorable conditions which  have resulted from  them.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government feel  bound, however,  toremark  that they have received little  assistance from either side in healing  the  breach  between them during  the long  months  of tension  and unrest  which  have followed  on  the  disturbances  of
 August 1929,  ank\ that  to  the difficulties created by  the  matsa- suspicions and hostilities of the two races has been Jidieli a further grave obstacle,  nameijy,  an  attitude or&apos;&quot;&quot; mistrust  towards His Majesty&apos;s  Government fostered&apos; by a press campaign  in which the true  facts of the situation  have become obscured and distorted. It  cannot be too strongly  emphasised that  on the establishment of  better  relations  between Arabs and  Jews  depend  the  future peace and prosperity  of the country which is  dear to both  races. This  is the object which His Majesty&apos;s Government have constantly in  view, and they feel that it is more likely  to be attained if both sides will  willingly  co-operate  with the Government and with the Palestine Administration, and endeavour to realise that, in eveiy way consistent with their Mandatory obligations, His Majesty&apos;s Govern- ment  may be  trusted  to safeguard and  promote the interests  of both  races.    3.  Many  of  the   misunderstandings  which have  unhappily arisen on both  sides  appear to be the result of a failure to appreciate the nature of  the duty imposed upon His Majesty&apos;s Government by the terms of the Mandate.   The next  point, therefore,  which His Majesty&apos;s  Government feel it  necessary  to emphasise,  in the strongest manner possible,  is  that  in  the  words of  the  Prime Ministers statement in the House of  Commons  on the 3rd April last.  &quot; a double  undertaking is involved, to  the  Jewish people on the one hand and to the non-Jewish population of Palestine  on the other.&quot;    Much of  the  agitation which has taken place during the past year  seems to have  arisen from a failure to realise the  full  import of  this fundamental fact.   Both Arabs and  Jews have assailed the Government with demands  and reproaches based upon the false assumption that  it was the  duty of His  Majesty&apos;s  Government to execute  policies  from  which they are, in fact,  debarred  by the explicit terms of the Mandate.    The  Prime Minister,  in  the  statement  above  referred to, announced, in  words which could not have been made more  plain, that it is the intention of Plis  Majesty&apos;s Government to continue to  administer  Palestine  in accordance  with  the terms  of  the Mandate,  as approved by the  Council of the League of  Nations. &quot; That &quot; said Mr. ramsay MacDonald,  &quot; is an international  obliga- tion from which there  can be no question  of receding.&quot;  In  spite of so unequivocal  a statement, the hope seems to  have been entertained that,  by some  means or other,  an  escape could be found from the limitations plainly imposed  by  the  terms  of the Mandate.  It must be  realised, once and  for all, that it is useless for Jewish leaders on  the one hand to press His  Majesty&apos;s Government to  conform their  policy in regard, for  example,  to immigration  and  land,  to the aspirations of  the more uncompromising  sections  of  Zionist opinion.  That would  be  to ignore the equally important duty  of the Mandatory  Power  towards  the   non-Jewish  inhabitants  of Palestine.    On the other hand, it  is equally  useless for Arab  leaders  to maintain  their demands for a form of Constitution,  which would render it impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to  carry out, in  the fullest sense, the  double undertaking already referred to. His Majesty &apos;s  Government have reason  to think that one  of the reasons for the sustained tension and agitation on both sides has been  the creation by  misguided advisers of  the false hopes that efforts to  intimidate  and  to  bring  pressure  to bear  upon His Majesty&apos;s Government would eventually result in  forcing them into a policy  which weighted the balances  in  favour of the one  or the other party.    It becomes, therefore,  essential  that at the outset His Majesty&apos;s Government should  make it  clear that they will not be  moved, by any pressure or threats, from the path laid down in the Mandate, and from  the  pursuit of  a  policy which aims  at  promoting the interests of the inhabitants of Palestine,  both Arabs and Jews, in a manner which shall  be consistent with the  obligations  which the Mandate imposes.    4.   This is not the first time that  His Majesty&apos;s  Government have  endeavoured to  make clear  the  nature  of their policy inPalestine.   In 1922  a full statement  was published and  was
 eommulicft ed  both to  the  Palestine  Arab  Delegation,  then in London, and to trfe^iOJiist Organisation.  Thj?s statement met with no  acceptance on the  pat 1/    the  AraM)&apos; Delegation,  but  the Executive of the Zionist Organisation passed a Resolution assuring His Majesty&apos;s Government  that the activities  of  the  Organisation would be conducted in conformity with the policy therein set forth. Moreover, in the letter conveying the text of this Resolution to His Majesty&apos;s Government, Dr.  Weizmann wrote:         &quot;The Zionist  Organisation has, at all time, been sincerely    desirous  of proceeding  in harmonious  co-operation  with  all    sections  of the people of Palestine.   It has repeatedly made it  *    clear, both in word and deed,  that  nothing is further from its    purpose  than  to  prejudice in the smallest degree the  civil or    religious rights,  or the material interests of  the non-Jewish    population.&quot;    The experience of the intervening years has inevitably brought to  light  certain  administrative  defects  and  special  economic problems,  which have to be taken into account in considering the welfare of  all sections of  the  community.   Nevertheless,  the statement of policy, issued after prolonged and careful consideration. in 1922, provides the foundations upon which future British policy in Palestine must be built up.    5.  Apart from proposals for the  establishment of a Constitution in Palestine which will be dealt with in later paragraphs, there are three important points  dealt  with in this statement which must now be recalled :  (a) The meaning  attached  by His  Majesttfs  Government  to the        expression &quot; the Jewish Natwial Home,&apos;1 which is contained        in the Mandate.    On this  point, the  following passage may be quoted from  the 1922  Statement:-        &apos;&apos; During the  last two or three generations the  Jews have    recreated in Palestine a community, now numbering 80,000, of    whom about one-fourth  are farmers  or workers upon the land.    This  community  has  its own  political  organs;  an  elected    assembly for the  direction  of its  domestic  concerns;  elected    councils  in the towns; and an organisation  for the control of its    schools.   It has  its elected  Chief  Rabbinate and  Rabbinical    Council  for the direction  of its  religious affairs.  Its business    is conducted in Hebrew  as a vernacular language and a Hebrew    press serves its  needs.   It  has its  distinctive intellectual  life     and displays considerable  economic activity.   This community,     then,  with  its  town  and  country  population,  its  political,     religious and  social organisation, its  own language,  its  own     customs, its own life,  has in  fact  &quot;national&quot; characteristics.     When it is asked what is meant by  the development of the     Jewish  National Home  in Palestine, it may be answered that     it  is not  the imposition of  a Jewish nationality  upon  the     inhabitants of Palestine  as a whole, but the further development     of the existing Jewish community, with the  assistance of Jews     in other parts  of the  world,  in order that  it may become  a     centre in  which  the Jewish people as a whole may take,  on     grounds of religion and race,  an interest and a pride.  But in     order that this community should have the best prospect of free     development  and  provide a full  opportunity for  the  Jewish     people to display its capacities, it is essential that it should know     that it is in Palestine as of  right and  not  on sufferance.  That     is the reason why it is necessary that the existence  of a Jewish     National  Home   in   Palestine  should   be  internationally     guaranteed, and  that it should  be formally  recognised to rest     upon ancient historic connection.        &quot; This, then,  is the  interpretation which His Majesty&apos;s     Government  place  upon  the  Declaration of  1917,  and,  so     undei&apos;stood, the Secretary of State is of opinion that it does not     contain  or imply  anything  which  need cause either alarm to     the Arab  population of  Palestine  or disappointment to the     Jews.&quot;
(b)  The principles which should govern immigration.   On this point the statement of policy continues as follows :        &quot; Eor the  fulfilment of this policy  it is necessary that the   Jewish  community in Palestine should be  able  to  increase its   numbers by immigration.  This immigration cannot be so great   in volume as to exceed whatever may be the economic capacity   of  the  country at the  time to  absorb new arrivals.    It  is   essential to ensure that the immigrants should not be a burden   upon the people of Palestine as a whole, and that  they  should   not  deprive  any  section  of  the  present  population of their   employment.   Hitherto  the  immigration  has  fulfilled  these   conditions.   The  number of  immigrants  since  the  British   occupation has been  about 25,000.       &quot;It  is  necessary also to  ensure   that  persons &apos;who are   politically undesirable are  excluded from Palestine and every   precaution has been  and will be  taken by  the  Administration   to that  end.&quot;   It will be observed that the principles  enunciated above  render it essential  that in estimating the  absorptive capacity  of Palestineat any time account should  be taken  of  Arab  as  well as  Jewishunemployment in determining the rate at which immigration shouldbe permitted.  It is the  intention of His Majesty&apos;s  Government totake steps to ensure a more exact application of  these principles inthe future.(c)  The position of the Jeicish Agency.    In the  passage quoted below, an attempt was made to indicate the limitations, implicit  in the Mandate, necessarily imposed uponthe  scope  of the Jewish Agency provided for  in Article  4 of theMandate :        &quot; It is also necessary to point out that  the Zionist Commis-    sion in Palestine, now termed the Palestine Zionist Executive,    has not desired to possess, and does not possess, any share in    the general administration of the country.  Nor  does the special    position assigned  to  the Zionist Organisation in Article IV of    the draft Mandate  for  Palestine imply any  such  functions.    That special  position relates  to  the   measures  affecting  the    Jewish  population,  and  contemplates that  the  Organisation    may assist  in the general development of the country, but does    not entitle  it  to share in any degree in its Government.&quot;    6.  His Majesty&apos;s Government desire  to reaffirm generally thepolicy outlined in the 1922 Statement, and, in particular, the threepassages quoted above.   On these  three important  points it is not thought that anything but  barren controversy  would result froman  attempt further to elaborate their  conceptions.  It is recognised,however, in the  light of past  experience that  much remains to bedone  to  improve  the   practical  application  of  the  principlesenunciated in the foregoing passages, and it is the  intention ofthe Government, in consultation  with the Palestine Administra-tion,  to  take active steps &quot;to  provide  improved  machinery  for meeting the requirements  of both Arabs and  Jews,  under these three heads.  In  particular,  it is recognised  as  of  the  greatest importance  that  the efforts of the High  Commissioner   towardssome closer and  more harmonious form of co-operation and meansof  consultation  between the  Palestine  Administration  and  *;heJewish Agency should be  further developed,  always  consistently,however, with the principle which must be regarded as basic, thatthe  special position of  the Agency, in affording  advice  a;;idco-operation, does not  entitle the Agency, as such, to share iinthe government of  the  country.  Similarly,  machinery must beprovided to ensure that the essential  interests of  the non-Jewiahsections of the Community should at the  same time be fully safe- guarded,  and that  adequate opportunity should  be  afforded  for consultation with the Palestine Administration on matters effectingthose interests.
G    7.  At this point it  becomes desirable  to  remove  any ground of misunderstanding that may exist as to  the passages in  the Mandate bearing  upon  the  safeguarding  of  the  rights of  the non-Jewish  community   in   Palestine.    The  passages   in   the Mandate specially  bearing on this point will  be found in     Article 2.   &quot;The Mandatory shall be  responsible for placing the  country  under such  political  administrative  and  economic conditions as will secure the establishment  of  the Jewish  National Home, as laid down in the preamble, and the  development of self- governing institutions,  and  also  for  safeguarding the civil and religious rights of all the inhabitants of Palestine, irrespective of race  and religion.&quot;    Article 6.   &quot;The Administration of Palestine, while  ensuring that  the rights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced, shall facilitate Jewish immigration under  suitable conditions,  and shall encourage, in co-operation with the Jewish agency referred to  in Article 4, close settlement by  Jews on the land, including State lands  and  waste lands  not  required  for public purposes.&quot;    Article 9.   &quot;The Mandatory  shall  be  responsible  for seeing that  the judicial  system  established in Palestine  shall assure  to foreigners,  as well as to natives,  a complete  guarantee  of their rights.    Respect for personal status of the various peoples and communi- ties and for their religious interests  shall be fully guaranteed.   In particular,  the  control  and  administration  of Wakfs  shall  be exercised in accordance with religious law  and the dispositions of the founders.&quot;    Article 13.  &quot;All responsibility  in connection with the Holy Places and  religious buildings or sites in Palestine, including that of preserving  existing rights  and of  securing free access to  the Holy Places, religious buildings and  sites, and the  free   exercise of worship,  while  ensuring  the requirements of public order and decorum, is assumed by the Mandatory, who  shall be responsible solely to the  League of  Nations  in all matters connected  here- with, provided that  nothing  in  this  article  shall  prevent  the Mandatory  from entering into such arrangements as he may  deem reasonable with the Administration for the purpose of carrying the provisions of this article into effect, and  provided also  that  nothing in this   Mandate  shall   be  construed  as conferring  upon  the Mandatory  authority  to  interfere with the  fabric or  the  manage- ment of  purely Moslem  sacred shrines, the immunities of which are guaranteed.&quot;    Article 15.  &quot; The Mandatory  shall see that complete  freedom of conscience and the free exercise of all forms of worship, subject only  to  the  maintenance of public order and morals, are   ensured to all.   No discrimination of any kind shall be made between the inhabitants  of Palestine on  the  ground of race,   religion  or language.  No person shall be excluded from  Palestine  on the sole ground of his  religious belief.    The  right of each community  to maintain its own schools for the education of its own members  in  its own language, while conforming to such educational requirements of a general nature as the  Administration  may  impose,  shall  not  be  denied  or impaired.&quot;    On  the  other  hand,  special reference to  the Jewish  National Home and to Jewish interests  are contained in Article 4 :     Article 4.   &quot; An appropriate Jewish agency shall be recognised as a  public  body for the purpose of advising and co-operating with the Administration of Palestine in such economic, social and other matters  as  may affect the establishment of  the Jewish  national home and  the interests  of  the Jewish  population  in Palestine, and,  subject always to the control of the Administration,  to assist and take part in the development of the country.    The  Zionist organisation,  so long  as its  organisation  and constitution are in the opinion of the Mandatory appropriate, shall be recognised as such agency.   It shall  take  steps in consultation with  His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s  Government to  secure  the co-opera-
tion of all Jews who are willing to assist in the establishment ofthe Jewish National Home.&quot;    Article 6.   (Already quoted above.)    Article 11.   &quot;The  Administration of  Palestine shall take all necessary measures to safeguard the interests of the community in connection with the development of  the country,  and, subjectto any international obligations accepted by  the  mandatory, shallhave full power to provide  for public ownership or control of anyof the natural resources of the country  or  of  the public works,services  and utilities established or to be established therein.   Itshall  introduce  a  land system  appropriate  to  the  needs of  thecountry,  having  regard,  among other things, to the desirabilityof promoting the close settlement and intensive cultivation of  theland.  .    The  Administration may  arrange with  the  Jewish  Agencymentioned in Article  4  to  construct or  operate, upon  fair and equitable  terms,  any  public works, services  and utilities, and  todevelop any of the natural resources of the country,  in so far  as these matters are not  directly undertaken by the Administration.Any such  arrangements  shall provide that no  profits  distributedby  such  agency directly  or indirectly, shall exceed a  reasonablerate of  interest on  the capital,  and any further profits shall be utilised by it for the benefit of the country in a manner  approvedby the Administration.&quot;    8.  In the first place, it will be observed that Article 2 makes the Mandatory responsible for safeguarding the  civil and religiousrights of all the inhabitants of  Palestine, irrespective  of race  orreligion; and secondly, that the obligation contained in Article 6 tofacilitate Jewish immigration and to encourage close settlement byJews  on  the land,  is  qualified by the requirement to  ensure thatthe rights and  position of other sections  of the population are  notprejudiced.    Moreover,  by  Article 11  &quot; the  Administration  ofPalestine is required to take all necessary measures  to safeguard the interests of the community in connection  with the developmentof the country.&quot;   It is clear from the warding of this  Article thatthe  population of  Palestine  as  a whole,  and  not  any  sectionalinterest,  is to be the object of the Governments care, and it maybe noted that the provision for arranging with the Jewish agency for the  construction or operation of public works, services andutilities,  is  only permissive  and not obligatory,  and could not beallowed to conflict with the  general interests of the  community.These  points are emphasised because claims  have been  made onbehalf of the Jewish Agoney to a position in  regard to the general administration  of  the  country,  which His Majesty&apos;s government cannot but  regard  as  going far beyond  the clear intention of  theMandate.  Moreover, attempts have been  made to argue, in supportof Zionist claims,  that the  principal feature of the Mandate  is the passages  regarding the  Jewish  National Home,  and   that  the passages designed to safeguard  the  rights of the non-Jewish com-munity  are merely secondary considerations  qualifying, to  someextent,  what is claimed  to  be  the primary  object for which  theMandate has been framed.    This  is  a  conception which  His Majesty&apos;s  Government have always regarded as totally  erroneous.  However difficult the taskmay be it would, in their view, be impossible, consistently with the plain intention of  the Mandate, to attempt  to  solve  the problem by  subordinating one of these obligations to the other.   The BritishAccredited Representative,  when  appearing before the  permanent mandates Commission  on the 9th of June last, endeavoured to make clear the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government  towards the diffi-culties inherent in the Mandate.   In commenting  on  his  state-ments in their report to the Council,  the Permanent  mandates commission made the  following  important pronouncement:         &quot;From  all these statements two  assertions emerge,  which    should be emphasised :           (1) that  the obligations laid  down  by the Mandate  in       regard  to  the two sections  of  the population are of  equal      weight;
s          (2)  that the two  obligations  imposed on  the  Mandatory       are in no sense irreconcilable.&quot;       &quot; The  Mandates Commission  has no  objection to raise  to   these two assertions, which, in its view,  accurately express what   it conceives to be the essence of the Mandate for Palestine and   ensure its  future.&quot;   His Majesty&apos;s Government are fully in accord  with the sense of this pronouncement and it is  a source  of  satisfaction to themthat it has been rendered authoritative by  the approval  of  theCouncil of the League of Nations.   It is the difficult  and delicate task of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto devise means whereby, in the execution of its policy in Palestine,equal  weight  shall  at all  times be given  to  the  obligations laiddown  with  regard to  the  two sections of  the population  and  to reconcile  those  two  obligations  where,  inevitably,  conflictinginterests are involved.   It is  hoped that  the foregoing explanation  of the nature of thetask imposed by the  Mandate upon  His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill  make  clear the  necessity,  already emphasised,   for  willingco-operation  with  the Palestine  Administration   and  with  HisMajesty&apos;s  Government on the  part   both of Arab and  Jewishleaders.   9.  The preceding  paragraphs contain an  exposition  of  thegeneral principles which have to be taken  into account as govern-ing policy  in  Palestine and the limiting conditions  under which itmust be carried out.    The practical  problems with  which HisMajesty&apos;s Government are faced  in  Palestine must  now be  con-sidered in detail.   These may be regarded as falling roughly under  three heads :        (1)  Security,       (2)  Constitutional development,       (3) Economic and Social development.   They will be dealt with in that order.                          (1) Security.   10.  It is  a primary duty of the administration to ensure peace,-order and good  government in Palestine.   In  an earlier paragraph(p.  3  of draft)  His Majesty&apos;s Government  have  intimated  thatthey will not be moved from their duty by  any pressure or threats.   Outbreaks of disorder in the past have been promptly repressedand  special measures  have  been  taken to deal  with  any futureemergencies.    It must be clearly understood that incitements todisorder or disaffection, in whatever quarter  they  may originate,will  be severely punished and the powers of the  administration will, so far as may  be necessary, be enlarged to enable it  to dealthe  more effectively with  any such dangerous and  unwarrantableattempts.   His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided to retain in Palestine,for the present, the existing garrison  consisting of two battalions of infantry plus the following units of  the Eoyal Air Force :  two squadrons  of air craft, and four sections of armoured cars.  It willbe recalled that Mr.  Dowbiggin, Inspector-General of Police, Ceylon,was  sent  to  Palestine to  enquire into the  organisation  of thePalestine Police Force. His elaborate and valuable report has beenreceived and is under detailed consideration.  Certain of his reeom-mendations have already been carried out, including those involving an increase in the strength of the British  and Palestinian sectionsof the Force and those providing for a scheme  of defence for JewishColonies, to &quot;which reference was made  in paragraph 9 of the state-ment  with regard  to  British Policy  in  Palestine,  published  asCommand  Paper 3582.  The  remainder of  the many recommenda-tions  in Mr.  Dowbiggin&apos;s report  are under  consideration  in con-sultation with the  High Commissioner for Palestine,  and  further changes will  be made when  decisions  are taken on these  recom-mendations.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government avail themselves  of this opportunity  to  reiterate their determination  to  take  all possible
steps  to  suppress  crime and  maintain order in Palestine.  they desire  to  emphasise,  in this  connexion,  that  in  determining thenature and  composition of  the security forces necessary for  thispurpose they must be guided  by  their expert advisers, and mustaim at ensuring that the forces employed are suitable for the duties which  they have to carry out,  without regard to any political  con-siderations.                (2) Constitutional Development.   11.  Reference has already been made (page 3) to the demandsof Arab  leaders  for  a  form  of constitution  which  would be incompatible  with  the mandatory  obligations of  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.   It  is,  however,  the  considered  opinion  of  HisMajesty&apos;s Government that the  time has  now  come  when  theimportant question of  the  establishment of  a measure of  self-government  in  Palestine must, in the interests of the  community as a whole, be taken in hand without further delay.   It  may be  convenient,  in  the first  instance, to give  a  briefresume of the  history of this  question since the  establishment ofthe civil  administration.   In  October  1920  there  was set up  in Palestine an AdvisoryCouncil composed in equal parts of official and  nominated unofficial members.  Of  the ten  unofficial members,  four were  Moslems,three  were Christians and three were Jews.   On the 1st September,  1922, the Palestine Order in  council was issued, setting up a Government in Palestine under the ForeignJurisdiction  Act.   Part 8 of  the Order in Council directed theestablishment of a Legislative Council to be  composed of the HighCommissioner  as  President,  with  ten other  official  members,  and12 elected non-official members.   The procedure  for the selection of the  non-official members was laid  down   in the  LegislativeCouncil, Order  in Council, 1922, and in February and March 1923an attempt  was made  to hold elections  in  accordance with  that procedure.   The attempt failed owing to the refusal of  the Arab  populationas a whole  to  co-operate (a  detailed report of these elections  is contained in the papers relating to the elections  for the PalestineLegislative Council, 1923, published as Command Paper  1889).   The High Commissioner  thereupon suspended the establishmentof the  proposed   Legislative Council, and  continued  to  act inconsultation with an Advisory  Council as before.   Two further opportunities  were given to  representative  Arableaders in Palestine to co-operate with the  Administration in thegovernment of  the  country,  first,  by  the  reconstitution  of  anominated. Advisory Council, but  with membership conforming tothat  proposed  for the  Legislative Council,  and, secondly, by aproposal for the formation  of an Arab  agency.  It was intended that this Agency should have functions analogous to those entrusted to the Jewish Agency by Article 4 of the Palestine  Mandate.   Neither of these opportunities was accepted and,  accordingly, inDecember 1923, an Advisory Council was set up consisting only of official members.  This position still continues;  the only  changebeing that the  Advisory Council has been enlarged by the additionof more official members  as  the Administration developed.   It will be  recalled  that, under the terms  of  Article 2 of theMandate, His  Majesty&apos;s  Government are responsible  for  placing the country  under  such political,   administrative  and  economicconditions as will  secure the establishment of  the Jewish national home and the development of self-governing  institutions,  and for safeguarding the civil and religious rights of the inhabitants.   Theaction taken with regard to  constitutional development in the early years  of  the  Civil  Administration  is  briefly  described  in  theforegoing paragraph.   With the object  of enabling the  people  of  Palestine to obtainpractical experience of administrative methods and the business ofgovernment and to  learn discrimination  in  the selection of theirrepresentatives, Lord  Plumer,  who  was  High Commissioner forPalestine  from 1925 to 1928, introduced  a wider  measure  of  localself-government than  had previously obtained under  the  Britishregime.
   Sir John Chancellor considered the question of constitutional development on his assumption of the office of High commissioner in December 1928.  He consulted representatives of various local interests and,  after  a careful examination  of  the position,  putforward certain proposals in June 1929.  Discussion of the question was,  however, suspended  in consequence  of the disturbances inAugust 1929.   12.   His Majesty&apos;s Government have now carefully considered this  question in the light of the present stage of progress  anddevelopment and  with special regard to their obligation to place the  country under  such  political,  administrative  and economicconditions   as  will   secure  the  development  of  self-governing institutions.   They have  decided that  the time has arrived for afurther step in the direction of the grant to the people of Palestine,of a measure of self-government compatible with the terms of theMandate.   His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  accordingly  intend to  set  up  a legislative Council generally on the lines indicated in the statementof British policy in Palestine issued by Mr. Churchill in June 1922,which is reproduced as Appendix 5  to the Report of the Commissionon the Palestine disturbances  of August 1929.   His Majesty&apos;?.,  Government trust that on this occasion they  will secure  the  co-operation  of  all  sections of  the  population ofPalestine.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government desire to make it quite clearthat while they would deeply regret an attempt on the part of  any section of the population to prevent them from giving effect to their decision,  all possible  steps  will be  taken  to circumvent such anattempt, if made, since  they consider it  in the interests  of  thepopulation of the country as  a whole  that  the  further step  nowproposed should  no longer be  deferred.   His Maiesty&apos;s  Government would point out that had this Legis-lature been set up at the  time when it was first contemplated thepeople of Palestine would by now have gained more experience ofthe  working  of  constitutional machinery.   Such experience  is indispensable for any progress in constitutional development.   the sooner all sections of the population show a desire to co-operate with Plis Majesty&apos;s Government in this respect,  the sooner will itbe possible for such constitutional development  to  take  place, asHis  Majesty&apos;s  Government hope to see in Palestine.    There are obvious advantages to be gained by all sections of thepopulation  from the establishment of such  a Council.  It shouldbe of  special benefit to the Arab section of the population, who donot  at present possess any  constitutional means for putting  theirviews on social and economic matters before the Government. Theirrepresentatives on the Council w7hich is to be  set up  will, of course,be in the position, not only to present the  views of the Arab sectionof the population on these and other matters, but also to participate in discussions thereon.    A  further  advantage may accrue to thecountry as  a whole  from  the establishment of  the LegislativeCouncil,  viz., that  the   participation  of  representatives  of  bothsections of  the communitj7 as members of the Legislative Council,will tend to improve  the relations between the Jews  and the Arabs.    13.  As  stated above, the new Legislative Council will be onthe  lines indicated in the statement of policy issued  in 1922.   Itwill consist of the High  Commissioner and 22 members, of whomten  will be official members and 12 unofficial members.   unofficial members of the Council  will  normally be elected by  primary  and secondary elections.   It is,  however, in the  view of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, so important to avoid  the repetition of  the deadlockwhich occurred in 1923 that steps will be devised so  as to ensurethe  appointment of the requisite number of unofficial members to the  Council in the event of  one  or more  members failing to be elected  on  account  of the non-co-operation  of any section of  the population, or for any other reason.  The High  Commissioner will continue to have the necessary power to ensure that the Mandatory shall be enabled to carry out its obligations to the League of Nations, including  any legislation  urgently required, as well as the main- tenance of order.    When difference  arises as to the fulfilment by the Government of Palestine of the terms  of the Mandate, a  petition to the  League
of Nations is  admissible under Article  85 of  the  Order in Councilof 1922.              (8) Economic and Social  Development.    14.   Under this head the practical problems to be consideredare mainly concerned with questions relating to land,  immigration and  unemployment.   These  three   questions  are  intimatelyinterrelated,  with political as well as economic aspects,  and upon their solution must depend  any  advance that can be hoped fortowards settled conditions of peace and  prosperity in Palestine.    Since attention was drawn to these matters in  the Report of theShaw  Commission,  they  have  formed  the subject  of  detailedinvestigations on the spot by a  Committee appointed by the HighCommissioner in April, to examine  into the economic  condition ofagriculturists  and the fiscal measures  of Government in  relationthereto,  and  also by Sir John Hope  Simpson who,  on instructions from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, proceeded to palestine in May  in order to examine the questions  of immigration,  landsettlement  and development.    15.   As a  result of these  extensive and elaborate investigations,certain  conclusions  have emerged  and  certain  facts have beenestablished which will now be set  out briefly :                            (1)  hand.    It can  now be definitely stated  that at  the present  time andwith the present methods of Arab  cultivation,  there  remains no margin   of  land available   for  agricultural   settlement  by  newimmigrants, with the exception of  such undeveloped  land as  thevarious  Jewish agencies hold  in reserve.    There has been  much criticism in the past  in  regard to  the relatively small extent of State land  which has been made availablefor Jewish settlement.   It  has, however, been  shown  that it isan error to imagine that the  Palestine Government is in possessionof large areas of vacant land which could be  made available forJewish settlement.  The extent of unoccupied areas of  Governmentland is  negligible.    The Government claims considerable  ares which are, in fact,  occupied  and cultivated by Arabs.  Even werethe title of the  Government to  these areas admitted,  and it is inmany cases disputed, it would not be possible to  make these areasavailable for  Jewish settlement, in view of their  actual occupation by  Arab cultivators and of the  importance in the present circum-stances  of  making available additional  land on which  to place  theArab cultivators who have been  rendered landless.    The  provision of a margin available  for settlement depends uponthe progress made in increasing the productivity of the land alreadyoccupied.    16.   It now appears, in the light of  the best available estimates,that the area of  cultivable land in Palestine (&quot;excluding  the Beer-Sheba region) is 6,544,000 dunams.   This area is considerably lessthan had hitherto been  estimated.    It has also been shown that while an area of at least 180 dunamsis required to maintain a fellah  family in  a  decent  standard of life in the unirrigated tracts,  the whole  of the cultivable land in thecountry excluding the area already in the hands of the  Jews would,were it  divided  among the existing Arab cultivators, provide anaverage holding  of not more  than  90 dunams.  In order to provide an  average holding of  180 dunams  for all  the  Arab cultivators,about 8  million dunams of cultivable land would be required.    It also  appears  that of the  86,980 rural  Arab  families in  the villages, 29-4 per cent, are landless.  It  is not known how manyof these are  families  who previously  cultivated  and have sincelost  their land.   This is a point,  among others, upon  which,  atpresent, it is not  possible to speak with greater  precision,  but which should  be ascertained in  the  course of the Census which isto be taken next year.    17.   The condition of the Arab fellah is little, if at  all,  superior to what it  was under the Turkish regime, and  until a comprehensive-sive policy of land development can be instituted,  little progress
in the improvement of the conditions of life of the Arab cultivatorcan be hoped for.   The sole agencies which  have pursued  a  consistent policy  ofland development have been the Jewish Colonisation  organisations,public and private.   The Jewish settlers  have had  every  advantage  that  capital,science and organisation could give them.  To these and  to the energy  of the  settlers  themselves their  remarkable progress  isdue.  On the other hand, the Arab population, while lacking theadvantages  enjoyed by the Jewish  settlers,  has,  by the excess  of births over  deaths,  increased  with  great rapidity, while the landavailable  for  its  sustenance  has  decreased by  about  a  milliondunams, which have  passed  into the hands of the  Jews.   18.  Reference has been  made  to the energy evinced and the remarkable  progress made  in Jewish land  settlement.  It wouldbe unjust to accept the contention, which has been advanced  inthe course  of  the  controversy regarding relations  between jews and Arabs in Palestine,  that the  effect  of Jewish settlement uponthe Arab population  has in  all  cases been   detrimental  to theinterests of the Arabs.  This  is by no  means  wholly true, but itis necessary in  considering this aspect of  the  problem to differen-tiate between colonisation by such  bodies as the Palestine JewishColonisation Association (known  shortly  as   the  P.I.C.A.)  andcolonisation under  Zionist  auspices.   In so far as the  past policy of the P.I.C.A.  is concerned, therecan be no doubt that the Arab has profited largely by the installa-tion of the Colonies, and relations between the colonists and theirArab  neighbours  have  in  the past been excellent.   The  cases which are now quoted by the Jewish  authorities to establish theadvantageous  effect of Jewish colonisation  on the  Arabs in theneighbourhood  are  cases relating  to  Colonies  established  by theP.I.C.A.   before   colonisation  financed   from  the   PalestineFoundation Fund,  which is the main  financial instrument  of theJewish Agency, came into  existence.   Some  of the attempts  which have  been made  to  prove  thatZionist colonisation has  not had the effect of causing the previoustenants of  land  acquired  to  join the landless class have  on examination proved to be unconvincing, if not fallacious.   19.  Moreover, the effect of Jewish colonisation on the existingpopulation is very  intimately  affected by  the  conditions on whichthe various Jewish  bodies  hold, sell and lease their land.  It  isprovided  by the  Constitution of  the  Enlarged Jewish Agency,signed at Geneva on the 14th August,  1929 (Article 3 (d) and (e)),that  the  land acquired shall be held as the &apos;&apos; inalienable propertyof the Jewish people,&quot; and  that in &quot; all the  works or undertakingscarried out  or  furthered by  the Agency, it shall be  deemed  to  bea  matter of principle that Jewish labour shall be  employed.&quot;Moreover,  by Article  23 of the  draft lease,  which  it is proposedto execute in respect of all holdings  granted by the Jewish NationalFund, the lessee undertakes to  execute all  works connected withthe cultivation  of the holdings only  with Jewish labour.   Stringentconditions  are  imposed  to  ensure  the observance of this under-taking.   An undertaking binding settlers in the Colonies of the MaritimePlain  to  hire  Jewish workmen only,  whenever  they may  be obliged to hire  help, is  inserted in the Agreement  for  the  repay-ment of advances made by the Palestine Foundation Fund.  similar provision is contained in  the  Agreement for the Emek Colonies.   These stringent provisions are  in  striking contrast with thesolemn declaration at  the Zionist Congress of  1921 of &quot;the desire of the Jewish people  to live  with  the  Arab people  in relations  of friendship  and mutual   respect,  and,  together, with  the  Arabpeople, to develop the homeland  common to both into a prosperouscommunity  which would  ensure the growth  of  the peoples.&quot;   20.  The Jewish leaders have  been perfectly frank in  theirjustification  of  this  policy.   The Executive of   the  GeneralFederation  of  Jewish Labour which  exercises  a very  important influence  on the direction  of Zionist policy have contended  thatsuch  restrictions are  necessary  for the promotion  of the  largest possible amount of  Jewish  immigration and for  the safeguarding
of the standard of life of the Jewish labourer from the danger of falling to the lower standard of the Arab.   However logical such arguments, from the point of view of theJewish National Home, it must, nevertheless, be pointed out thatthey are irrelevant in view  of  the  provisions of Article  6 of theMandate, which  expressly   requires that,  in  facilitating  jewish immigration  and  close  settlement by  Jews  on  the land,  theAdministration  of  Palestine must  ensure that &quot; the  rights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced.&quot;                  (2) Agricultural Development.   21.   As  indicated in the immediately preceding paragraph, itis the duty of  the Administration  under  the  Mandate to ensurethat the  position of the &apos;&apos; other sections of the population&apos;&apos; is notprejudiced by Jewish immigration.  Also, it is its duty under theMandate to  ensure the close- settlement of  the Jews on the land,subject always to  the former condition.   22.   As   a  result  of   recent   investigations,  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment are satisfied that, in order to secure these objects, thereis a  fundamental necessity for  a methodical scheme of agricultural development which will ensure  the  use of the land of the countryto better purposes than  has been the  case hitherto.   This  development should have two  distinct aims :     (a) To improve the method  of cultivation of the Arab fellah  on          the  unirrigated  land, and   also  to extend irrigation          wherever that is possible, so that the fellah will be able          to gain a reasonable livelihood  from a smaller area of          land  than that  which  has  been  considered  essential          hitherto.    (b) So to rearrange holdings of land that there will be a margin          for  further settlement in accordance with the terms of          Article  6 of the Mandate.    There is reason to hope  that if such development is undertaken in accordance  with a definite plan, there  will unquestionably besufficient land  both for an Arab population increasing by excess of births over deaths,  and for additional Jewish  settlement.  Theresult desired  will not be obtained except  by years of work.  Itis for this reason  peculiarly fortunate  that the Jewish  organisa-tions are in  possession of a large reserve of land  not yet settledor developed.  Their operations can continue without  break, whilethe general scheme of development is being worked out and broughtinto operation.  Until,  however, the  scheme  is worked out, thecontrol  of all  disposition of land must of necessity rest with theauthority in charge of the development.  Transfers of land shouldbe  permitted  only in so far as they  do  not  interfere with that scheme.    23.   Plaving regard  to   the  responsibilities  of  the MandatoryPower,  it is  clear that the  Development  Organisation which  mustbe  set up should  be  subject to the authority and direction of thePalestine Administration.   On the other hand, it is an  equallyclear necessity that, with  this work  of  development,  existingJewish organisations should be  closely  and harmoniously associatedand  that steps should  be taken  to  ensure  association of  an appropriate  representation of Arab interests.    It is not proposed to discuss at length the detailed method ofworking out the scheme  of development or the machinery by whichit is to be  undertaken.  These are  matters  which  will  require careful consideration in  the  light of authoritative technical advice.It should however, be made clear that it follows as a corollary of theposition  that  disposition of land and its  development  must  besubject   to  full  Governmental  control,  that  any  schemes  ofdevelopment should provide for the settlement both  of Jews and arabs in a  developed area  and  should  take into consideration the plans of colonisation of Jewish agencies, in order that development by these Agencies and  by  the  Commission may be co-ordinated.The claims  of would-be  settlers of both sections  of the population should be considered simultaneously and the development authority must have the final decision on the schemes.
    The  scheme  explained  above  in  outline  depends  for  its success on loyal co-operation of the Jewish Colonisation agencieswith  the  Development  Authority.   Constant  touch  should  bemaintained between that Authority and the Jewish agencies, andtheir  schemes of development,  though intended for Jewish settle-ment land, must be so framed as to fall in  with  schemes for thedevelopment  of  the country  as  a whole.    This is the only way in which the provisions of Article 6 of theMandate  can be observed  and  close settlement  of Jews on  theland  encouraged,  without prejudicing the  position of  the  other sections of the population.    It is also only by  co-operation that  artificial inflation  of theprice  of the land will  be prevented.    24.  An important and difficult problem which  will confront thedevelopment  authority  is that  of local migration.  In some cases it will probably be found necessary to increase the  size of a fellah&apos;sholding in the  hills  so as to  enable him  to enjoy a  reasonable standard of life.  It clearly will not be possible to do so  except by arrangements which will  involve the transfer of some other fellahfrom  the  hills  elsewhere, and  the use of  the latter&apos;s holding  toincrease that of  the  former.   Experience  of similar problems  inother countries shows that this task is likely to require very tactfulhandling.    Other  connected problems which will have to be considered arethose of irrigation,  the  relations of the development authority  withthe Department of Agriculture and other Government Departments,and a determination of their respective spheres of action so as toavoid friction and overlapping,  and to obtain the greatest efficiency in co-ordinated effort.    Consideration must  also be  given to the protection  of tenantsby  some form of  occupancy right, or by other means,  to  securethem against ejection or  the imposition of  excessive rental.    Closely associated with any development scheme  must be  the acceleration of the  work of settlement by the ascertainment of title and the  registration  of  tenancies,  and,   in this connection an.important  problem is  presented by  the large proportion of Arabvillage land which  is held under the tenure-in-common  known  asmesha&apos;a.   Nearly half of the  Arab  villages  are held on mesha&apos;atenure and there is a consensus of opinion  that this system is agreat obstacle to any agricultural development of  the.Country.    The constitution  of  co-operative credit  societies  among  thefellahin appears  to be  an essential preliminary to their  advance-ment.  The whole  question  has recently been under examinationon  behalf  of the Palestine Government by  an  expert with greatexperience.    25.  The  finances of  Palestine  have been severely strained bythe necessity of  providing for large increases in its security  forces.These have been deemed essential in the light of the events of theautumn of 1929, and it is not possible to forecast the time  that must elapse before it  will be thought safe  to reduce expenditure on this account.  That  must largely depend on the success of the policyof development now envisaged,  and on the extent of the  improve-ment in  mutual relations  between  Arabs  and  Jews which HisMajesty&apos;s Government hope will be one of its results.    It is part of  the general policy of  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthat Palestine should be  self-supporting.   The  scheme of develop-ment outlined  above  will not  only take  time,  but will involve considerable  expenditure, though  it  is to  be hoped  that part  ofthe outlay will prove to be recoverable.  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare giving earnest consideration to  the  financial position whicharises out of this situation, and steps  are being taken to concert thenecessary measures to give effect to their policy.                        (3) Immigration.  :  26.  The whole system under which immigration into Palestineisoontrolled by the Administration  has recently.been most carefully examined, and in  the month of May it was considered  necessary by  His Majesty &apos;s  Government  to  suspend  the  further  issue  of certificates for  the admission   of  immigrants  under, the Labour
 Schedule i.e.,  as  employed persons  (over  and  above the  950 already issued) for the half year ending the 30th September, 1930, pending the result  of this examination  and the determination of future  policy.   This examination has  revealed certain weaknesses in the existing system.  It has been shown that under it there have been many cases of persons being admitted, who, if all the facts had  been known, should not  have received visas.   No  effective Government control exists in regard to the selection of immigrants from abroad, with the result  that there are no adequate safeguards against irregularities  in connection with  the issue of immigration certificates, and also  against the immigration of undesirables.  A further unsatisfactory feature is that a large number of travellers who  enter Palestine with  permission to remain for a limited time, stay  on without sanction.  It is calculated that the  number of such cases during  the last three  years  amounted to 7,800.  Another serious feature of immigration is the number of persons who evade the frontier control without  formality of any kind.    In any attempt  to devise adequate Government machinery for- the control of immigration, account must be taken of  the important part  at present played in connection with Jewish  immigration by the General Federation of Jewish Labour.  The influence of the General Federation  is far-reaching, its activities  are  manifold.  It constitutes  an important  factor within the  World Zionist move- ment, and at the last Zionist Congress more than a quarter of the total  number of delegates represented such  Zionists  circles,  both in Palestine and abroad as are identified  with the Federation. The influence wdiich  the Federation  is able to exert  upon immigrants is  shown by the fact  that its members are not permitted  to  have recourse to the  Courts of the country  in  cases  of  dispute  with another member.   It has its  own  Courts  of  First  and  Second Instance and its  Labour  High Court, to which  appeals from the subordinate Tribunals lie.  The Federation has adopted the policy which implies the introduction into Palestine of a new social order based on communal settlements and the principle of &apos;&apos; self-labour &apos;&apos; (i.e.,  that each man should work for himself and avoid employment of  hired labourers).   Where  self-labour is impossible it insists on the  employment of  Jewish  labour  exclusively  by  all  Jewish employers.    In view  of its responsibilities under the Mandate  it is essential that  the  Palestine  Government as  the  agent of  the Mandatory Power should be the  deciding  authority  in  all matters of policy relating to immigration,  especially  having regard  to its  close relation  to  unemployment  and  land  development  policy.    No adequate improvement in existing machinery can be devised unless a modus vivendi is established between the Government on  the one hand and  the Jewish Agency on the other,  in regard to their respective functions, and full account must be taken of the influence exerted in the  policy  of the  Agency  by the General Federation of Jewish  labour.    27.  As regards  the relation  of immigration  to unemployment, great difficulties  at present exist owing to the  absence of efficient machinery for  estimating the  degree of unemployment existing at  any  time.  It is  especially true as regards the Arab section of the  community.   While  no  reliable  statistics  are  available, sufficient evidence has been adduced  to lead to the  conclusion that there is at present a  serious degree of Arab unemployment, and that  Jewish  unemployment  likewise exists  to  an  extent  which constitutes a definitely unsatisfactory feature.  It may be regarded as clearly established  that the preparation of the Labour Schedule must  depend upon the ascertainment  of  the total  of unemployed in Palestine.  It follows that the existence of that  unemployment must  be accurately determined, and His Majesty&apos;s Government will give serious consideration  to devising machinery  for this purpose. The economic capacity of the country to absorb new immigrants must  therefore  take  into  account the  position of  Palestine  as a whole in regard to unemployment, and care must also  be exercised, in ascertaining  that economic  capacity,  to make allowances for any demand for labour, which, owing to increased circulation of money connected with  expenditure on development  or for other  causes,may be regarded as  of a temporary  character.
                              1G   28.  Article  6 of  the Mandate  directs  that the  rights  and position of  the other  sections of  the population  shall  not  be prejudiced  by  Jewish immigration.   Clearly,  if immigration of jews results in preventing the Arab population  from obtaining thework necessary for its maintenance, it is the duty of  the MandatoryPower under the Mandate to reduce, or, if  necessary, to suspendsuch  immigration until  the  unemployed  portion  of the  &apos;&apos; other sections &quot; is in a position to obtain work.  It may here be  remarked that in the light  of the examination  to  which immigration  and unemployment  problems  have  been  subjected,  His   Majesty&apos;sGovernment regard  their action in the suspension of immigrationunder  the Labour Schedule last May as fully justified.   It has been  argued that  the High Commissioners approval ofthe issue  of Immigration Certificates under the Labour Scheduleimplied that  there  was room for the admission of  immigrants ofthe working class, and that, in consequence, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment,  in suspending the issue of those certificates, must have been influenced by  political considerations.  This is not  the  case.   in arriving at their decision to suspend the  issue  of the certificates,His Majesty&apos;s Government had in mind the opinions expressed inthe Report of the Shaw Commission that  there was a shortage ofland and  that immigration should be more  closely  controlled.  Itwas realised  that  these  issues called for  expert examination, but his  Majesty&apos;s  Government  felt  that, until  they  had  been soexamined,  no steps should  be taken  which might  aggravate aneconomic  situation  which, in  the opinion of the majority of theShaw  Commission,  was  already  such as  to  afford  ground  for anxiety.   Any  hasty  decision  in  regard   to  more unrestricted jewish immigration is to be strongly deprecated,  not only  from the pointof view of the interests of the Palestine population as a whole, but even from the special  point of view  of the Jewish community.  Solong as widespread suspicion exists,  and it does exist, amongst theArab  population, that the economic  depression,  under which theyundoubtedly suffer  at present, is largely  due  to excessive jewish immigration, and so long as some grounds  exist upon  which thissuspicion  may be plausibly represented to be well  founded,  therecan be little  hope of any improvement in the mutual relations ofthe two races.  But it is upon such improvement  that the futurepeace  and prosperity of Palestine must largely depend.    It  is hoped that  changes may be devised in the method of thepreparation of the Labour Schedule  which will tend  to increase theamicable relations between the Jewish  authorities in Palestine andthe Immigration Department.  It is clearly desirable to establishcloser co-operation and consultation  between the Jewish authoritiesand the  Government, and  the  closer  more  cordial co-operationbecomes,  the  easier it should be to  arrive at  an agreed Schedulebased  upon  a  thorough  understanding,  on  both  sides, of theeconomic  needs of the country.    29.  As has been shown  in the foregoing paragraphs, the threeproblems  of  development,  immigration  and   unemployment  are closely inter-related, and upon the  development of  a policy whichwill take full account of  these three  factors must depend  the futureof Palestine.  It is only in a peaceful and prosperous Palestine thatthe  ideals of  the  Jewish  National  Home  can in  any  sense berealised, and  it is only  by cordial  co-operation between  the Jews,the Arabs and the Government that prosperity can be secured.    The situation revealed by exhaustive examination of the variouseconomic, political  and social factors involved,  makes it  clear that palestine has. reached  a critical moment in its development.  In thepast it may  be said that the Government has  left economic and&apos;social  forces to operate with the minimum of interference or control,but  it has become  increasingly  clear  that  such a  policy can nolonger continue.  It is  only the closest  cooperation between  theGovernment  and the leaders of the  Arab  and  Jewish communitiesthat  can  prevent Palestine  from drifting into  a  situation whichwould imperil,  on  the one hand, the  devoted work of those whohave sought to build  up the Jewish National  Home, and, on theother, the interests of the majority of the population who at presentpossess few  resources of their  own  with. which   to  sustain  the
straggle  for existence.   It  is hoped,  therefore, that the Jewishleaders will recognise that it is necessary to call upon them to make some  concessions on their side  in regard to the independent andseparatist ideals which they have in the past developed in connectionwith the Jewish  National  Home, and  to accept the offer of HisMajesty&apos;s Government  of co-operation  with them in the general development of the country, in such a way that the interests of theArabs and Jews  may each receive adequate  consideration, with theobject  of developing  prosperity throughout the  country under conditions which will give no grounds for charges of partiality uponthe one side  or  upon the other, but will permit of the Arab and jewish communities developing  in harmony and contentment.o
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT, i 6                                     APPENDIX   II.                                           Refugee Settlement Commission,I                                                       Athens, August 18,  1930.I  (Personal and Confidential.)  My dear Lord Passfield,      WITH my letter of the  22nd inst. I have forwarded to you my report on the  enquiry into Land  Settlement, Development  and Immigration in  Palestine.  That  report suffers from  the fact that it was prepared with great speed and under great  stress of work, and that I had no time to polish it in any way.  It comes to you  exactly as originally drafted.      2.  There is a  good deal on  the Palestine question, which it  is desirable that  you should know, but which,  for obvious reasons, it was undesirable to include in a  report of which the publication might be demanded, or might seem to you desirable.  For this reason, I propose to mention in this letter a number  of points which have  either been omitted from the report, or have  been mentioned  but not developed.      3.  In the first place, I do not think that the Palestine Government  or,  indeed,  the Mandatory Power can escape the criticism which is freely made, that there has  been failure to carry out the terms of the Mandate.  The fact that those terms are  exceedingly difficult of observance does not excuse neglect of their express  provisions.      Under Article  2 of the Mandate the Mandatory is responsible, inter alia, for  the establishment of such economic conditions as will secure the establishment of the  Jewish  National Home.      Under Article  6 the Administration of Palestine is bound to ensure the rights  and position of other sections of the population against prejudice, and at the  same  time to facilitate Jewish immigration, and to encourage the close settlement of Jews  on the land.      Under Article 11  the  Administration is bound  to  introduce  a  land system  appropriate to the needs of the country, having regard, among other things, to the  desirability of promoting the close settlement and intensive cultivation of the land.      4.  The Administration has not in fact succeeded in accomplishing any of these  things.  It has stood aside and allowed the Jews to purchase large areas of land and  to settle them on conditions which, as shown in the Report, have constituted a serious  infringement of the position  of the  Arabs whom they displace.  It has not assisted  the Jews actively in the matter of immigration.  On  the contrary (probably  with  unconscious wisdom), it has  done much to impede immigration.  It has taken no  serious steps towards the development of the country and the combination  of land  purchase by  the  Jews,  with failure to develop the land held  by the fellah, has  produced a serious  state of affairs among the fellahin.      5.  The  attitude of the Administration has resembled that  of a  spectator   perhaps an interested spectator of a social experiment carried on before his  eyes,  but in which he does not feel that he has a duty to take an active part. Now and  then when trouble developed the Government has been compelled to take a hand,  but once the trouble over, the statiis quo was  resumed.      6.  It is a curious but unfortunate fact that all British officials tend to become  pro-Arab, or, perhaps more accurately, anti-Jew,  though it would be quite untrue  to suggest that the failure to carry out the Mandate is due to that point.   Personally  I can quite well understand this trait.  The helplessness of the fellah appeals to the  British official with whom he comes in touch.   The offensive self-assertion of the  Jewish  immigrant  is, on the other hand, repellent..  And this self-assertion is a  common characteristic of the Chalutzim-the Jewish &quot;Pioneer.&quot;      If the official is a Jew,.his sympathies are  naturally all the other way, and the  Jews are the most clannish of people.  For this reason I think it is  unfortunate that  Bentwich holds the position of Attorney-General.  He  is a nice fellow and a very  able man, but he  is in a false position.  No one outside the Jewish circle can  trust  him to act without Jewish bias.      7.  Palestine,  at  the moment, is a land  with  two  main  sections  of  the  population.  On the one hand, the Arab, in a large majority, chiefly an agricultural  population, primitive in cultural practice, intelligent enough  and  most desirous to  learn, but  ignorant and devoid of  the capital  winch  is necessary to agricultural        [21627]                                                         b
development.  On the other hand, we have the Jew, intelligent, educated, forceful,with every advantage of ample capital and  expert advice,  and who, whatever hisleaders may say for public consumption, is entirely unmoved by any consideration ofwhat suffering may be inflicted on the Arab by the Jewish determination to create a jewish State in Palestine.  That is the true object of the settler.  It is, of course,not ventilated generally, but conversation with the men, and still more  so with thewomen, makes it  quite clear.  The women all believe that the correct policy for theGovernment lies in the transfer of the Arab population to Trans-Jordania in orderto make room for an influx of Jews.    8.  When Jewish  settlement first began in the  eighties of last  century,  itconnoted no political ambition, and the Rothschild colonies lived in peace and amitywith their Arab neighbours, and were, in fact, of great assistance to them, providingthem with regular  employment,  and assisting  them to develop the Arab lands inproximity to the  new Jewish Settlements.  The same practice prevailed  in the caseof the German Colonies.   Even to-day, though things are changing rapidly,  andunder Zionist pressure the P.I.C.A. colonies are being compelled gradually to part with their Arab workmen, the friendly spirit animating the Arab towards the oldsettlers in the P.I.C.A. colonies is in marked contrast to their keen hostility to thesettlers introduced by the Zionist organization.  Had the method of the P.I.C.A.continued, no political question would have arisen, and the Jews could have effecteda peaceful penetration of Palestine without any opposition on the part of the arab population.    9.  The Zionists  were  provided  with  very  large funds, and proceeded topurchase extensive properties, mainly from  non-resident landlords.  No effectivesteps were taken by the  Government to protect the  interests,  not only of  the peasantcultivator, but also of the other residents of  the areas purchased.  Attempts were,indeed, made by legislative means, but  without success, to secure that the tenants ofthese  lands  at  least received some land in  lieu of compensation for  disturbance.The Jews were not illiberal in this matter they did more than was strictly required of them by the law. In  the event, however, the money compensation which they gavewas rapidly spent, and in a large number of  cases there can be no doubt that thosewho in the past  had been  cultivators of the land have been compelled to join the ranks of  casual labour.   The position of the  rest of the population of a purchasedvillage was even  worse.   They received no compensation of  any kind.   The villagewhich had afforded them a home and a livelihood disappeared and was replaced by aZionist settlement,  which  either, in accordance with its principles, employed nolabour whatever,  or, equally on principle,  when employing labour, employed Jewishlabour only.  In addition to the labourers of the village there was a class of graziers,who, by custom, were permitted as of right to  use the waste lands of the village, and,after harvest, the cultivated lands, for the use of their flocks and herds.   These menalso were left to make such arrangements as they could, and have found it exceedingly difficult to make any satisfactory arrangements at all.    10.  This process has gone on until the Jews themselves  realize that  the problemof the landless Arab i*s becoming serious.  I was informed by Mr. Hankin, the buyerof the  Palestine  Land Development Company, which  purchases  land not only forthe Zionists,  but also  for a  considerable number  of private persons and  landcompanies, that after he has purchased another 100,000 dunams of land, it will beimpossible to  acquire any more without  making  arrangements  on the purchasedproperty for the Arabs who had hitherto found their livelihood there.  My enquirysuggests  that  the view  expressed by Mr.  Hankin  does not  go  far enough.  It hasrevealed without  any doubt that even now the fellahin have not got enough land toenable them, with their  present method of cultivation, to obtain sufficient to providea decent standard of life.   It is essential that every available dunam of  land should now be retained,  to provide holdings for  those who, having lost their land,  desireto cultivate,  and to increase  the size  of  the existing holdings where the fellahinhave not  got sufficient land for their needs. This should be done until arrangements can be made for  the development of the land, for an agricultural education of thefellah, and for some form of Agricultural credit on l-easonable terms.    11.  A further fact established by the  enquiry is the  appalling state of debtin which the fellah finds himself.  This is in  part due to our system of law.  In theTurkish Courts much latitude was left to the  Judge to  apply equity in his decisions.He was not bound by statute in the way in which a Judge under our r6gime is bound,
and I have no doubt that in many cases in which it was found that the debt was greater than the fellah could pay equity was considered to  demand  that a  decreefor a less amount would meet the justice of the case.    12.  In our  Courts all this is changed.  The Wadi Hawareth case is a goodinstance.  In that area there are a large number of persons who have no rights whichthey can establish in the Courts, but who have exercised certain privileges for manyyears  and who cannot find any similar area for the exercise of those privilegeselsewhere.  They are to be ejected in  favour of Jewish  purchasers.  According  to law,  it  is right  that they should be so ejected, but I doubt whether any TurkishCourt would have carried out an ejection of the kind.    In  that same area the Beduin of the Beersheba area (many miles away) allegethat they were accustomed to graze their animals in the summer when  the Beersbebaarea affords no grazing.  There is no proof which our Courts would accept that theyhave the right to this grazing. It is difficult to establish the existence of a customab antiauo.   I do not know that they have made any claim in the Courts.  It  is extremely improbable that they would.  They are wild  and semi-civilized people.But when they find that the land has been taken and enclosed by the Jews, and thatthe grazing grounds of their cattle and  their camels have been transformed intoorange groves, into which they are not allowed to trespass, they will conceive hatrednot only for the Jew this they already entertain but also for  the  Government,whom they will hold responsible for what they will consider  a grave  injustice.    13.  In  the  matter  of debt,  it is  true  that  our  law  limits the interest  to  per  cent.  The intention was to  prevent  unconscionable  burdens of  interestaccumulating against the debtor.   In fact, the provision is  quite useless.   In thefirst  place, the bond is never for the  actual sum advanced,  but for  a larger sum,which discounts the possibility of a reduction of  the  interest by the Court.   In thesecond place, even were the interest included at a higher than the legal rate, it wouldbe impossible for the debtor to defend himself in  Court on  this ground, as, if  he did so,  it would be quite certain that he would  neves again  receive financialaccommodation,  either from the money-lender in question or from  any other.  Theordinary system  is  what  is known in  Arabic  as  &quot; Ashara  bil hamastash,&quot;i.e.,  &quot;ten-fifteen.&quot;  The debtor receives a sum of   10 and  signs a bond for   15,payable at harvest.  The rate of interest works out at about 75 per cent, per annum.    14.  But not only is the fellah class in debt.  The effendi is in debt also, and it isin satisfaction of debt that many estates are. sold up. This would be an advantage if the result of the sale were the break up of the  large estates.   That is not theresult.   There are no purchasers in Palestine at the present time except the jews and, to a minor extent, the religious orders, especially those of Italy.  So the largeestate  passes to the  Jewish National Fund, and  becomes &quot; the inalienable propertyof the  Jewish people.&quot;   It will be used for the settlement  of Jews on conditionswhich render it impossible that any but a Jew can ever  hold the land in future, orcan ever be employed on it as a labourer.  This is, from every point of view, a mostserious happening.  It is undesirable from the economic point of view, for unempioy-ment among the Arabs is already a serious problem.  The  political  aspect of thematter  is even more serious, for it confirms the Arab in the belief commonly held thatJewish policy is designed deliberately to oust the Arab from the land of Palestine.And it is impossible to affirm that this belief  is unfounded.  The policy of the zionists indicates that their ultimate intention,  by means of steady and consistentland purchase and settlement with the provisions  noted, is to buy the country, and to buy it  under conditions  which will render it impossible for any  Arab to earn hisdaily bread  in  the territory which  they  have  acquired.   It is  a  policy  of theinevitability of gradualness of the most sinister kind.     15.  There are a number of serious questions raised in the report which I neednot re-examine  in  this letter.  The  question of tenant right will require  orders.That of indebtedness will,  I  suppose, be dealt with on  Strickland&apos;s report.   It isfor this reason that I have not gone into the question of an Agricultural Bank.  Themost  important  question  with which I have  dealt is that  of  the provision  of facilities for the development of the land.  In this matter the Administration is to blame.   The Department  of Agriculture has doubtless done  what it  could, but theresults  are very small.  There has been  a lack of realization both there  and in thegeneral policy  of the Administration of the very serious nature  of the  problem.The Department has done very fine work in  locust campaigns and in veterinary       [21627]                                                        B 2
operations in connection with cattle plague and foot and mouth disease.  But muchexpenditure has been misdirected,  as, for instance, the importation of pure-bredArab stallions from England* a luxury for the well-to-do and of no value whateverfor the ordinary cultivator, on whose behalf every available penny should have been spent.   The Departmental expenses are very high, and seem to me to be out of proportion with  the  amount spent on practical  work.  The latter is the greatnecessity if the general cultural standards of the country are to be improved.  Therewas also much criticism on the subject of the salary of the  Superintendent of theAcre Station.   General  McNeill holds  that  position.  He was, I understand,appointed by Lord Plumer.  He is not in any sense an agriculturalist, though a veryattractive man personally.  He knows a horse, and  when it  was intended to breedpure-bred Arabs, he may have been not unsuitable.  The stallions, however, have beeninfected with dourine.  The horse-breeding operations have come to an end, and theimportant person for the bulls and cows is the stockman.  There was, therefore, acertain  justification for the criticism.  There is no work in the station to justify an appointment of  1,000 a year.     16.   In my report  I  suggest the creation of a Development Commission, withthe object that the land of  Palestine may be rendered  capable of holding a largerpopulation than it does  at present.  There is no other way of carrying out Article of the Mandate.  Either the existing area must be rendered capable of supportingmore cultivators, or the admission of Jews to settle  on the land must be prevented.And more cultivators can obtain subsistence from the soil of Palestine only if that land can produce more sustenance, that is to say, if the land is developed.  You will see from  the Report that there is not, in fact,  room in Palestine for the existingagricultural population.  It is my opinion that, with efficient development, there willbe room, not only for the existing population, but for one considerably larger.  Inthe Report  I  have ventured the personal opinion that the additional  number for whom room can be found will be not less than 20,000  families.  It might well be40,000.     There are  three points which I consider essential to successful development bythe  Commission.   The first is that when a tract is  taken up for development, theCommission should make  up its mind from the start, from what area it is going todraw the excess  Arab  cultivators for settlement  on the land of that tract whendeveloped. The second, that in each tract developed a certain number of Jews shouldbe settled simultaneously with the Arabs.   The third, that the  Commission shouldnot sell the land, either to Jew or Arab, but should let it on long lease.  The reasonfor this last is obvious.  The scheme contemplates expropriation of land, which inthe nature of things can only be Arab land.  If this is sold to Jews, the unanswerableaccusation will be made that the Government, after forcing down the price of land by its policy of control, has taken Arab land by expropriation,  and has sold it at thisreduced price to the Jew.  In view  of Article 6 of the Mandate, we must be careful to avoid any justification of an accusation of the kind.  It will be sufficiently difficultto meet the accusation that the land has been expropriated at a low price in order thatit may be used for settling the Jew as a tenant.  An ancillary advantage from thepolicy of leasing rather  than  of sale will be  found  in the cessation of Jewishmortmain, which I regard as an intolerable system.   The terms of the lease will beGovernment, not Jewish, terms.  The Jew will be a tenant of the Government ratherthan the proprietor of an inalienable portion of Palestine.  It is noticeable that theMandate  contains no provision whatever, contemplating purchase of land by Jews.     17.   It is proposed  that the  Development Commission should consist of aBritish Chairman, who should be its executive and  administrative officer, a Jewishand an Arab member all  three appointed by the  League the Commission  to besubordinate to the Secretary of State.  I do not know whether any political difficulty is likely to arise from such a constitution.  It appears to me to have the advantageof directing attack from the High Commissioner to a body, nominated by the League,and at the  same time to remove any suspicion that the Commission is simply an instrument of His Majesty&apos;s Government.     18.  The scheme will cost money, and that to His Majesty&apos;s Government.  Theactual loss of money will  be small, as most of the expenditure will be repayable.  Itwill all be reproductive.  This expenditure cannot be avoided.  The Palestine Budgetcannot bear it.  And it is right that the expense should fall on the British people,                             * From the Wentworth Stud.
   for it was their Government which accepted this remarkable Mandate.  This was notI  done by the  Palestinian  people.  The last thing which they desired was the   establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine.  Unless Great Britain is   prepared to surrender the Mandate (and I understand that the Dutch are willing toI  accept it),  she will be compelled to undertake  the expense of development.   These   are the two alternatives, and there is no avenue of escape.       19.  The relations between the Palestine Government and the Jewish Agency   are not of the character contemplated by the Mandate.  In practice, these relations   amount to the submission by the Jewish Agency of such information as may be from   time to time requested by the  Government, and of visits by the Chairman of the   Executive of the Jewish Agency to the High Commissioner, either when sent  for in   cases of difficulty between Jew and Arab, or, and this is the more frequent, when there   is matter which the Jewish Agency deems to be matter for  complaint.  Then the   Chairman requests an interview with the High Commissioner in order to voice the   Jewish &quot; demands.&quot;  As a general rule, the Government does not consult with the   Jewish Agency as to their operations, or make suggestions to them on the advisability   or otherwise  of their  course of action.  The High Commissioner  does not send for   Kisch and say to him &apos;&apos; What are you doing about this, or why are you doing that ?&apos;&apos;   There  is no live interest in the detail of the activity which is  going on under the  auspices of the Jewish Agency.       For instance, at the moment a communal colony  for workers is being  constructed   just outside the P.I.C.A. village of Ness Ziona.  This is being  done as a method   of enforcing  the policy of the General Federation of Jewish Labour, to exclude the   Arab workmen from Jewish villages, and the workers&apos;  colony is, in fact, a threat   and a menace.   This  was a case which should have  been known to the Government,   and in which the Government should have called on the Jewish Agency to explain   what it was  doing.  It is  probable that in time there will be trouble about labour   in Ness Ziona.  The price of oranges is falling, and shortly it will not be possible   to employ Jewish  labour at the rates fixed  by the  General Federation  and at the   same time to export oranges.  Yet the labourers who  are being planted on the borders  of Ness Ziona will demand employment, and will take steps to see  that  Arabs are  not employed for the picking and packing of the fruit.  This was eminently a case  in which consultation between the Government and the Jewish Agemy was desirable   before the construction of the labour colony commenced,  and the relations should be   such that schemes for. the construction of a new colony should be discussed as a   natural thing.       20.  It is true that it is exceedingly difficult to  initiate relations of the kind   discussed in the last paragraph.  Colonel Kisch is Chairman of the Executive of   the Jewish Agency in Palestine.   He  is not a man  who inspires confidence, and,   personally, I do  not feel that I could trust him.  I  know that Chancellor finds that   he  cannot  trust  him.  I also know  that  the  non-Zionist  group,  of  whom   Felix Warburg is a representative, does not  trust him either.   It is a very difficult   matter to have intimate and satisfactory relations with a man in whom you have no   confidence.       21. - There are extensive changes in prospect in the circles of the Jewish Agency.   The American group, represented outstandingly by Felix Warburg and Brandeis,   do not at all approve of the way in which matters have hitherto been run in Palestine.   Hexter is their representative on the Agency, and is a most competent man.   He is   gradually acquiring authority on the Executive.  As he represents the mass of the  American money, he wields powerful force.   It is desirable that both  the CO. and  the High Commissioner should  maintain the closest touch with this group.   The   High Commissioner can do that by close relations  with the  Jewish Agency,  even  before  the revolution occurs, which I foresee in the comparatively near future.       22.  In regard to Jewish Immigration, there is one important point, only lightly   touched upon in the report.   A large portion of the Jewish population depends for  its livelihood on the continuance of charitable subscriptions.  In the report  it is  recorded that to settle on the land 4,408 adults and their children has cost the  Zionists  4,891,000; and these people are not yet self-supporting.   They still depend  on the Zionist funds.    In addition  there is a very large number of people in the  towns who, in fact, depend on the money that comes in from outside.  If that flow  of money were for any reason to cease, the Government will be faced with an  acute  economic crisis.   Thousands  of Jews will require relief and maintenance.   It is
highly possible that, if my report is published  and the true facts become known,.subscriptions will fall off materially.    In the report it is suggested that, in certain cases, security should be demandedas a condition of allowing  immigration of labour which might subsequently be leftunemployed.   That is a principle which is capable of  wider  application indeed,application to the whole system of Jewish immigration.  It would be justifiable to demand, as  a condition  of  the  continuance  of  immigration  that  the Jewishauthorities should deposit with the Government a large sum, say,  500,000, in orderto ensure against a possible cessation of funds, and a consequent expense on relief ofthe Jewish population by the  Palestine Government.   The existing economic basisof Palestine Jewry is exceedingly precarious.  The Jews themselves say, as I have noted in the report, that the income  from subscriptions depends on the continuanceof immigration.  That  of itself demonstrates the precarious nature of the presentposition.    23.  Politically, the difficulty between Jew and Arab is largely due to the GrandMufti.  He is a man of small attainments, and, had he not been appointed GrandMufti by Sir Herbert Samuel, nothing would ever have been heard of him.   before i left Jerusalem I had a long interview with  him, in which I attempted to inducehim to  come to agreement with the Jews on the  subject  of the  Wailing  Wall.I acted, of course, purely in a private capacity.  The impression which he made onme was that of a man who  had no conception  of the method in  which such a subject should be handled.   He has a petty mind, and his whole attention is directed tomanoeuvres which will fortify his personal position.  I understand that there is an intention to remove him.   The sooner that is done the better for Palestine.    The Mufti&apos;s power  is based on his command of the purse.  In the Report I have pointed out that an income  of   30,000 from tithes of waqf properties is collected bythe Government and handed over to the Muslim Council.   There is at present noaudit of the expenditure of this money, and little doubt that the Mufti is using it for his own ends.  Chancellor  is contemplating legislation to provide for an annualaudit.   That will be  excellent.    The Turkish  Government has  abolished  waqf  altogether.   Such  a radicalmeasure would be impossible for  us, but,   if  the  waqf  income  were properlyadministered, it  is  possible that  a material  sum might be made available  for education of  the Arabs.  This would be an appropriate application of  waqf funds.    24.  I visited Trans-Jordania.   It is a fine country with  room for a large population.  Parts of it are very fertile.    At the  present time   the  Jew is  not   welcomed;  indeed,  not allowed  inTrans-Jordania.  If settlement were forced upon the  Trans-Jordan Government, itwould be essential to take extraordinary and  expensive steps for the defence of thecolonists.   The settlement  of Jews in Trans-Jordania is,  indeed, altogether out ofthe question.    It Avas frequently suggested that  Arabs should be removed from  Palestine toTrans-Jordania in order to  make room for Jews.  This is a matter of policy on whichI am not called upon  to report.  In my personal opinion  such a policy would be mostunjust,  and could not fail  to lead to grave political reactions.    25.  If the pipe-line from Iraq were to come to Haifa, the result would be theprovision  of  livelihood  for a large number  of  persons, and would  be of great assistance in settling the immigration problem.   The construction of a railway toIraq,  which  has been mooted, would  also react favourably.   There is a general opinion that  the initiation  of  a motor service  through Amman to Rutba  Wells andso on to Baghdad would be of great value to Palestine.  To me it seems that theeffect  of such a service  would be small.    26.  The treatment of  the Palestine Government by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin  financial matters was the subject  of frequent  criticism.   From the loan  thePalestine Government paid a lump sum of  1,000,000 for the railway and a further sum of  219,145 for  the Jaffa-Jerusalem line.  For the latter it also paid  287,793from revenue.  The return of the railways to the Palestine Government is negligible.    From revenue the Palestine Government  has paid   813,893 in respect of its share in the Ottoman  Debt.  Also, from  revenue  it  has paid  to  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment   206,451   on  account  of  the deficit  incurred  during the military administration.  This  does not seem a fair  charge.  It was,  in truth, a militaryexpense, and should  have been debited to the War expenditure.
o    The finances of Palestine have been extraordinarily well managed  by Davis,otherwise these payments could never have been made.   It is now  clear that theGovernment will have to face material  additional  expenditure  on  Police,  on education, on Health and on Agriculture.  The Palestine Budget cannot stand this additional expenditure.  It is  due to the  Jewish influx,&apos; the consequent need forincreased forces for security, and the urgency of the measures of development.  Itwould be just  that His Majesty&apos;s Government should come to the assistance of theAdministration by a grant-in-aid.   What its amount should  be will  depend on theincrease in the estimates of expenditure of the Palestine Government,  and I can offer no useful opinion.    27.   When we meet, I shall have the opportunity of speaking  to  you on thegeneral question of the Administration of Palestine.  It is a subject entirely outsidemy terms of reference, but is of great importance and  gives rise to certain obviouscriticisms in several directions.  Here it is sufficient to say that the  powers of thedistrict  and area officers, specially of the  latter, should be considerably enlarged.They  will be  the officers mainly  concerned with  the work of  the development commission.   They are the only officers, with the exception of some  of the medicalstaff, the settlement officers, and some of the officers of the Lands Department, whoare in constant touch, or should be in constant touch, with the villages. They shouldbe the eyes and  hands  of the  Administration.   At  the moment their statutoryposition is obscure and their powers much restricted.    28.   The  Zionist position is altogether anomalous.  In Palestine the policy isdictated by the General Federation of Jewish Labour.   Hitherto the Jewish agency in Palestine  has not  been  able to  resist  the influence of  the  Federation.  the immigration of Jews comes in far the greatest measure from Poland, from Russiaand from the Yemen.  The governing principles of immigration appear  to be  two :that the immigrant should come  from one of the countries where the -Jews areoppressed, and  that he  should support   the peculiar  doctrines of the  GeneralFederation of  Labour. Palestine is at the  moment, from the Jewish  point of view,serving  two purposes.  It is a place of relief for distressed Jews, and it  is the  scene of a social experiment of the Communist type on a very large scale.   The religiouselement enters into the matter scarcely at  all.  Of the people being settled in the communal colonies, there are very  few, if any, who are religious  people.  They areardently nationalist.  And this communistic experiment is being  carried out at  theexpense of the rich Jew of America, who probably  disapproves of the organizationof  labour  and to whom anything in the nature  of  Communistic  experiment isanathema maranatha.  The American Jews have no knowledge of the position.  Itis never published or ventilated.  Hexter has asked me to give him a note on  theactivities of  the  General Federation of Labour  in order  that he may  show  it toWarburg.  You will be able to advise me whether I should do that or not, once  thereport and the shouting are over. The experiment is not proving a financial success.It is costing an enormous amount of money, and the settlements, which have beenfounded at great expense, are in  few cases only self-supporting in  the sense thatthey are no longer demanding subventions  from the Zionist funds. In the majorityof cases they demand  that support.  In no case are they as yet repaying anything.One of the indications of the importance of the General Federation is found in  thefact that in the communal colonies the colonists have demanded that this  Federationshall be made a party to the lease of the National Fund and to the bond of the KerenHayesod.    29.   I am writing a separate letter in  reply to yours of the 15th  August.   Withthe present letter I enclose a copy of the Conclusions Chapter  of  the  Report, as originally drafted.  You will see  great changes in the Chapter,  as  it will come toyou with the  balance  of the report.  I had drafted this letter before yours of  the15th arrived,  and have replaced the last page.  This will explain  to you what might otherwise have seemed a discrepancy in the dates of these two letters.     I apologize for the  length of this communication.

                                           22nd August, 1930.To The Secretary of State  for the Colonies,    Colonial Office,        Whitehall,             London, S.W.1.MY LOUD,  In accordance with Your Lordship&apos;s instructions  I  proceeded to palestine in order to examine on the spot the questions of immigra-tion, land settlement and development on which you desired  thatI should report.  I reached Jerusalem  on 20th  May, 1930, and  at once  com-menced my  enquiry.   I was  in constant consultation  with theHigh  Commissioner, who  was thereafter  Ifept  in touch with theenquiry as it proceeded.  2, Much  information  has been  obtained  from official sources,and, in addition, both Arab and Jewish authorities and organisa-tions have been consulted.  Material has  been obtained from themost varied sources, and has often been volunteered.  In addition,as many tracts and villages of Palestine have been visited as thetime available permitted.   On Map No. 1, attached  to the Report,both the tours and inspection  of the  villages are marked.  3. In addition to local enquiry in Palestine itself a visit was paidto Trans-Jordan, where the British  Resident,  Lieutenant-ColonelC.  H.  F.  Cox,  C.M.G.,  D.S.O.,  very kindly  arranged  a  tourthroughout  the northern part of the territory.   His Highness the emir  of  Trans-Jordan  also  accorded  to me  the  favour  of an interview.  4. I  desire to  acknowledge  invaluable  assistance received inmany  quarters.   The High Commissioner,  Sir John Chancellor,G.C.M.G.,  G.C.V.O..,  D.S.O., and  Sir Spenser Davis, C.M.G.,Officer  Administering the  Government  after the departure of sir john Chancellor, afforded me every possible help, and in consultanttion the benefit of their knowledge and experience.  I  had access to the records of all Departments of the Government.  The  enquiryinevitably entailed  upon them heavy  additional work, and I expressmy sense of the obligation under which  the Heads  and staffs  ofthose Departments have placed me by the information which theycollected and supplied.  The  Supreme  Moslem Council  and  the  Arab Executive gavevalued  aid  in  the enquiry.  Specially I am indebted  to  JamalEffendi Hussein,  who  accompanied  me on  tours in  some of theArab  villages.  The Jewish Agency supplied a very large amount of information on  every  subject  investigated.   I record my  gratitude speciallyto Dr. Ruppin, whose aid was invaluable, and to Mr. Victor Konn,of the P.I.C.A.  These gentlemen arranged my tours through theJewish settlements.  Dr.  Wilkansky, of the Agricultural Experimental  Station at Tel-Aviv, not only placed his large technical knowledge of agriculturalmatters at my disposal and accompanied me on some  of my tours,but has placed me  under a  particular obligation by  allowing me touse the proof-sheets of his book, which is  about  to appear, on&quot; The Fellah&apos;s Farm &quot;.  Air-Commodore  Playfair, M.C.,  very kindly  arranged  for anaerial  test survey, of the  Hill  Districts for  the purposes of myenquiry.  They have been  a  deciding  element in the conclusions which have been reached.  To him  and the members of the AirForce  who carried out the  survey, my very sincere thanks are  due.   Special recognition is  also  due to  Mr.  C.  H.  Ley,  C.B.E.,Director of Surveys, and his staff, who  not only did  a large amountof work in  determining the areas but  also prepared  special mapswhich are attached to this report.
  It is impossible to acknowledge in detail the innumerable sourcesfrom  which help was drawn.  It may be  said generally that  allconcerned united to make my enquiry as complete as  was possiblein the time  at  my disposal.  I acknowledge with thanks the courtesy  of the &quot; Geographical&quot; Review &quot;,  published by the American Geographical Society ofNew-  York, and of Dr. Strahorn, in generously permitting me touse the soil map appended as Map No. 4 to the report.  Finally, I  desire fo record my deep obligation  to Mr. MauriceC. Bennett,  who  served throughout as  my secretary and accom-panied me to Athens, where the report was written, and to Mr.,C. Ij. Horton, my assistant secretary.  Had it not been for thedevoted service and untiring labours of  these two gentlemen, thereport could not possibly have been prepared by this date.  The report  has  been prepared under  great stress of work, andthere has been neither time  nor  opportunity to examine it  closelyafter it  was written, nor to rewrite any  portion of it.  This isregretted, but as the  report is urgently required, I send ;t  as it stands.  It contains, I trust, a fair reflection  of the  facts ascertainedand of the deductions to be  made from  those facts.  I now forward  for  your Lordship&apos;s information the Eenorl  onthe matters included in the terms of reference.I have, etc.,            J, HOPE SIMPSON.

                         CHAPTER I.            Palestine: The Country and the Climate.The total area of Palestine.  Palestine is a small country  generally stated to be  about the size of Wales.  There have been the most  varied estimates of its size and  varied statements and arguments based thereon.  The size of Palestine,  and  especially the cultivable  area of  the country,are  so highly relevant to the matters  under enquiry and to thedeductions which must be made,  that it is necessary to examine themore important of  the  statements and  the estimates with  somecare.  The &quot; Handbook of Palestine &quot; prepared  by Messrs.  Luke andKeith-Roach,  puts the total  area  at 10,000 sq. miles,  practically26,000,000 metric  dunams.  The Report of  the Experts submittedto the Joint Palestine Survey Commission  (p.  18) recorded 8,000sq.  miles.  They do not offer any  information as to the authority forthis figure.  On May 20th, 1925, a statement was made by Lord Stanhope inthe House of  Lords, which has frequently been quoted as authori-tative.  In that statement  he said that  the  total area of palestine was approximately  27,000,000 Turkish  dunams; this is equal to,528 sq. miles.  On July 4th, 1927, the Chief Secretary of the Palestine Govem-meut wrote a letter (No. 10,566-27) to the address  of Dr. Ruppin,Head of the Colonisation Department of the Zionist  Organisation,in  which he  said that the  total area of Palestine was  9,570  sq.miles.  The Statistical Abstract  for 1929 published at Jerusalem by  theKeren-Hayesod (Jewish  Foundation Fund) records  the area as10,170 sq. miles.  Finally, the Director of Surveys in Palestine reported to  theCommissioner of Lands in July,  1929, that, excluding the Beer-sheba  sub-district  and the  southern desert, the area  of the restof Palestine was 13,760,000 dunams, and that the area of Beershebasub-district and the southern desert was 12,398,000 dunams,  mak-ing the  total area of Palestine  26,158,000  dunams or  10,100  sq.miles.  In forwarding this estimate to the Chief  Secretary the Commis-sioner of Lands wrote :      &quot; .... I  would emphasise in the first place that pending completion    of  the topographical cadastral survey, any estimates submitted of the    cultivable and uncultivable areas of Palestine can be little more than    guess-work  based on insufficient data.&quot;   On the 20th July, 1930, the Director of Surveys forwarded to me the revised area estimate, and wrote in  his letter :      &quot;.....The estimate for Beersheba is quite unreliable, and any figures     must be misleading, since we have no sufficient  data and what can be    done  there in cultivation is entirely dependent on a most  unreliable     rainfall.&quot;   It may be accepted that  the total area  of  Palestine is in  theneighbourhood of 10,000 sq. miles in so far as  it can  be estimated.The question  of the cultivable area of the country will be discussed later in this  Report.The Natural  divisions of  Palestine.   The natural divisions of the country are :       (a) The hill country of Galilee and Judaea.       (6) The  five plains, including that lying in the rift which     contains  the  Jordan  Valley  and  which,  from  the  north of     Lake Tiberias  to the Dead  Sea, is actually below the level of     the Mediterranean.       (c) The Beersheba  area,  different  in character and popula-     tion from the rest of  the country.       (d) The  desert areas.   The Survey Department has prepared a map showing these divi-sions of the country.  It is appended to this Report as Map No. 2.
                     (oj THE! HILL COUNTRY.                              Area.  The area of this tract is estimated by the Commissioner of Lands-at 8,064,000 dunams, of  which 5,376,000 dunams  are cultivable.The area  classified as cultivable was  admittedly guess-work, theCommissioner  of Lands having accepted that  of the  total area  oftwo-thirds only were cultivable  and  one-third uncultivable.   Bythe courtesy of the Officer Commanding the Air  Force, a  testphotographic survey of the Hill country  was made for the purposeof this enquiry.   The area  so  surveyed  is shown in blue lines onMap  No. 2 attached to this Report.   This survey established thatthe cultivable  area of the hills  was not,  as had been assumed 66.6per cent., but only  40  per cent.   The  photographs  of the  aerialsurvey have been  very carefully examined by the Director of  Sur-veys in the latest  estimate submitted, which  is by far the mostreliable estimate hitherto prepared of the hill country  in Palestine.It records the total area, including the Hill Wilderness, as 8,862,000dunams, of which  nearly 2,450,000 dunams are  cultivable.  Exclud-ing the Hill  Wilderness  the  inhabited  Hills  are  estimated  at,124,000  dunams.  The difference between  the  figures quoted bythe Commissioner of Lands and those of the Director of  Surveys,whether the Wilderness is included or  omitted, is very large.  Theestimate of the Director of Surveys, based as it is in part on results obtained by aerial  survey, will be accepted for the purpose of thisReport.                      Soil and Agriculture.  The cultivated area in the Hills varies very largely both in depthand quality of  the soil.  In the valleys there are stretches  of fertileland, which will grow sesame  as a  summer crop.  On the hillsidesthe soil is shallow and infertile, and the extent  of  land hunger is evident from the fact  that every available plot  of soil  is cultivated,even  when it  is  so small that the plough  cannot be employed.There cultivation is carried on with the mattock and hoe.   the harvest of such plots, even in a  favourable year,  is exceedinglysmall in  general it seems  doubtful whether such cultivation canpay.   On  the  other hand,  even the most rocky hillsides supporttrees,  especially olives, and there is no  doubt  that  if capital wereavailable,  many of the  cultivators  of  these exiguous  and infertileplots would be able to gain a livelihood by cultivation  of fruit treesand of olives.   These cultivators have, however,  no capital, and cannot afford to forego even the meagre crops obtained, for the four or five years which are required before fruit  trees render  a return.In the case of  the olive, the period before a return may be expectedis much longer.                            Irrigation. -  There is little irrigation in the hill country.  Here and  there are springs which  afford a supply for the irrigation  of a small area, but, taken as a whole, the country  is arid and the crops depend on rain. It  is  possible  that a hydrographic survey might  disclose further water  supplies, and  scientific treatment might also improve the yield  from existing springs.  It is  stated that  during the War the Engineers of  the  Army of Occupation  were  able very largely to increase the supply from springs in certain places.                            Development.   In the best  case, however, it is impossible that the  general cha-r- acter  of the cultivation in the Hill country can  be radically changed, -except in so far as fruit  can be made  to replace  grain.  Something might be  done to improve trie  soil, and reform agricultural methods, were  capital available.  The use of manures  and provision of better seed  would doubtless result  in some improvement  of the yield. But  from the point of view  of agriculture, the Hill  country will always remain an unsatisfactory proposition.
                      (6) THE FIVE PLAINS.                    1. THE MARITIME PLAIN.                           Character.  A reference to Map No. 2 will show that the Maritime Plain istaken to  be  the area between the coast and the bills up  to the150  metre contour,  running from Rafa in the south up to Haifain the north.  Ordinarily the Maritime Plain is treated as runningJrom Rafa to Ras-en-Naqura, on  the Syrian border.  The  reasonfor the present division lies in  the difference  in the class  of soilof the  plains north  and south  of Haifa.   The  latter portion ofthe plain is the tract which contains the great mass  of wind-blownsand, so suitable for orange cultivation.  The former is in the  maina heavy black soil quite unsuited for oranges.  The Maritime Plain as shown in Map No. 2 is estimated by theDirector  of  Surveys to extend  to 3,218,000  dunams,  of  which2,663,000 dunams are cultivable.  This estimate agrees very closely,with that made by the Experts and printed on p. 22 of their Reportto the Joint Palestine Survey Commission.  They record the cultiv-able area.s :      Irrigable       ............   2,251,500 dunams     Non-irrigable   ...    ...     ...     ...     410,000 dunamsgiving a  total of 2,661,500 dunams.   It is true that they estimate the  non-cultivable area at a higher figure than  that adopted by theDirector of Surveys.  It is not clear how they  calculated this  area.In any case the difference has no great  importance, for in theuncultivable area no question of development arises.                      2. THE ACBE PLAIN.                              Area.   This is the coastal plain lying north  of Haifa and  running up between the sea and the  hills  as far as  the  Syrian border.  Its&apos;. total area is given by  the  Director of Surveys  as  550,000 metric dunams, 379,000 of which are  judged cultivable.   These figures  differ  materially from  the analagous figures re- corded by the Experts.  In the Report of the Experts on p.  22, this plain is  divided into the plain  north of Acre  and  the Haifa-Acre plain.    The total  area of the  two  amounts  to 183,000 Turkish dunams, i.e., 168,000 metric dunams.  The cultivable area is shown as 103,000  Turkish  dunams, i.e.,  94,500 metric  dunams.   The cultivable area is also  shown  as all irrigable.  It is not known whence the Experts obtained the estimate included in their Report.                            Character.   This plain is in the main composed of an alluvial deposit, ratherheavy in character.   There is a small area of wind-blown sand suit-able for plantations, but, generally, the  type of  developed cultiva-tion will be  mixed farming with irrigation.  There is ample waterfrom springs and streams.  A  large  area  in this plain is held bythe  Bayside  Land Corporation a Jewish corporation.                          Haifa Harbour.   The  future of this tract will  be advantageously  affected  by theconstruction of the Haifa Harbour.  Work is already  in progress and is advancing rapidly.   The  harbour will greatly  assist thedevelopment  of the export trade in oranges, and  perhaps  other agricultural  products.   It is understood that the question of thepipe-line from Iraq is not yet decided, and that  there are&apos;hopes that;it may be constructed to Haifa.  If this  development occurs theAcre Plain will of course benefit still further.                  3.; THE VALE OF ESDBAELON.                             Area.  In the division of the plans made by  the  Director  of Surveysand  included in Map No. 2, the  Vale of Esdraelon  has been sepa-rated from the  Valley of Jezreel, the latter being  included  with
800813the lands of the plain of the Jordan.  The total area of the Valeis reported as  being 400,000  metric dunams,  of  which 372,000metric dunams are cultivable.   Dr. Strahorn, in  his report on soils,minted in the Experts&apos; Report, records, on p. 151, that the Plainof Esdraelon has an area of 475,000 Turkish dunams,  i.e., 437,400metric dunams.  This is not very far removed  from the  estimatemade by the Director of Surveys.                             Fertility.  The evidence as to the fertility of the Vale of  Esdraelon and  thestate of its prosperity in the hands of the  Arabs, before the  exten-sive purchases made by the Jews,  is very conflicting.  In his reporton  the administration of Palestine,  1920-25, at  p. 35, Sir HerbertSamuel wrote :     &quot; . . . . Tho whole aspect  of the valley has been changed. The  wooden    huts of the villages, gradually giving place to red-roofed cottages, are    dotted along  the slopes; the plantations  of rapidly growing eucalyptus    trees already begin to give a  new character to the landscape; in the    spring the fields  of vegetables or  of cereals cover many miles of the    land, and  what  five years ago was little  better  than a wilderness is    being transformed before our eyes into a smiling countryside . .  . . &quot;  On the other hand, Dr.  Strahorn writes  in his report, p. 152 :     &quot; . . . . Up to  within recent  years the  land was cultivated from tho    Arab villages, located round  the  rim of the Plain.  Cereals together    with minor garden areas  around the villages constituted the  Arab crop-    ping  system.  In  very recent years considerable areas of  land  have    passed under the control  of Jewish colonies and villages; gardens  and    orchards are now dotting  the  former expanse of  grain-fields                   Results  of Jewish Settlement.  The results of Jewish colonisation of the Vale of Esdraelon arevaried.   In  some  villages there  are  clear signs  of success; in-others, the opposite is the  case.   The village of Afuleh, which theAmerican Zionist Commonwealth boomed as the Chicago of Pales-tine, is a sea of thistles through which one  travels for long distances.A plague of field mice, which has done extensive damage to bothJewish and  Arab  cultivation in the Vale  during the  present  year was officially stated to be due to  the fact  that 30,000 dunams ofthe land held by the Jews are  derelict and covered with weeds.  Itis also  a  fact  that  in a number  of villages the  tithes paid  by theJews are considerably below those paid by the Arabs who formerlycultivated those villages.                             Its Past.   It is a mistake to assume that the Vale of Bsdraelon was a  wilder-ness  before  the arrival of  the  Jewish settlers and that it is now aparadise.  A very  large amount  of money has  been  spent  by thevarious Jewish agencies, and great improvements have been made.The work that has been done, especially  in the direction of drain-age and the introduction of new and improved  methods of agricul-ture is highly valuable.  There can be little doubt that in time, theapplication  of  capital, science, and labour wiH result  in general success.  It is, however,  unjust  to the  poverty-stricken fellah  who has been removed  from  these  lands  that  the suggestion  shouldcontinually  be made that  he was a useless cumberer of  the  ground and produced  nothing from it.   It should be  quite  obvious  that this is not the fact.   In ancient times Esdraelon was the  granary, and by  the Arabs is  still regarded as the most fertile tract of Palestine.   The soreness felt owing to the sale of large  areas by the absentee Sursock family to the Jews and the displacement of the Arab tenants is still acute. It was evident on every occasion of discussion with  the  Arabs, both effendi and fellahin.                               Soils.    The soil of the valley is generally an alluvial clay, highly suitable to cereal  cultivation.  Across the  Vale at  one place there is a belt of residual  soil,  even heavier than  the alluvial of the  rest of the valley.   Both  in  the cultivation of cereals and in that  of fodder crops the soil responds to  high farming.
800814                    4. THE  HULEH PLAIN.                             Area.  The Huleh Plain is the most northerly  part of Palestine, to  theeast of the country, and  lies to the north  of the Lake of Tiberias.Its area is reported by the Director of Surveys as 10.1,000 metricdunams; of this extent 12(5,000 dunams are cultivable.   As in  thecase of other tracts  there are wide  variations in  the estimates of area.  The Experts,  in their Report, p. 22, put the area at 150,000Turkish dunams, i.e.,  138,000 metric dunams,  and the  cultivablearea at 120,000 Turkish dunams, i.e., 110,300 metric dunams.   Dr.Ruppin has submitted on behalf  of  the Jewish Agency  for Pales-tine a memorandum relating to the  land  and  agricultural  development-ment.  In the  course of that  memorandum he  says  that the areaof the Huleh district is approximately as follows :       Government land      ...    ...     ...    47,000 dunams     Private land     ............   110,000   do.     Lake Merom     ............     18,000   do.but does not specify whether  the  dunams used  are the Turkish ormetric dunams.  As in the rest of  the memorandum the  Turkishdunam is  habitually used,  it is  fair to  assume that he  has  alsoemployed it here.  In that case the estimate,  which  totals 175,000 (Turkish dunams), would represent 161,000 metric dunams.  There-are a number of other estimates of the tract, referring to the Lakeand marsh and to the cultivable areas.   Mr.  HankTu, whose dutyit is to purchase land for the Palestine  Land  Development Com- jpany, in an  interview  stated that the  total area  of the Huleh Plain up to the frontier was 230,000  dunams.  He probably in- tended Turkish dunams, making  211,500 metric dunams.                           Character.    The Huleh  Plain may  be divided  into  three parts.   In  the north there is  rich alluvial cultivable land; south of  this there is a large marshy  area covered with  papyrus reeds, the haunt of the wild  boar  and the grazing-grouud of  numerous water-buffaloes which are the property of the Bedu tribes of  the neighbourhood. South of  this  again is  the Lake of  Merom,  through  which  the Jordan flows southwards to Lake Tiberias.   The Lake  and marsh are caused by a ridge of basalt across  the Jordan Valley.  If tm*s ridge were cleared  away  or  the  river  deepened, the whole valley could be drained and considerable areas  of land made&quot; available for irrigated cultivation.                           Marsh Area.    As in the case of the other areas in Palestine, there are widely varying estimates of the extent of the  marsli and of  the extent of the lake.  Possibly one of the best is  that  recorded on  a French plan dated 1321 Hijra  (1903  A.D.)  which  is  attached to  this Report as Map No. 3.   According to that map, the areas of the concession (which will be described later) are :       Marsh          ............     36,844 dunams      JVake    ............     ...     11,921    do.      Cultivated land............      1,821    do.      Cultivable land............       353    do.  The figures are all Turkish dunams, and, reduced to metric dunams,  the areas are :       Marsh        .........     33,871 metric dunams      Lake............     10,958      do.       Cultivated land       ......     1,677      do.       Cultivable, land       ......       325      do.  The concessionaire estimates the marsh at  41,400  metric dunams  and the Lake at 13,800 metric dunams.   Of  the  former some  9,200  metric dunams are, he. says, cultivated by Arabs.  In the Experts&apos;  Report (p. 154) Dr. Strahorn says  that the area of the marsh  north  of the Lake  ia not less than 52,000 Turkish  dunams, i.e., 47,800  .xjoetric dunams.
  No survey of the marsh area has been made,  nor is one possibleexcept by air, until the mai&apos;sh is drained.  It will be safe to assume that, excluding the cultivation  of the Arabs in  that area, there isstill an area  of some 25,000  to  30,000 metric uunams  of marshland  available for reclamation.  Were  the Lake also  drained  afurther 9,000 or  10,000 metric dunams would be rendered cultiv-able.  The soil of the whole Huleh  Plain is exceedingly fertile.   Itis indeed  said to  be the most,fertile soil in Palestine.                 5. THE PLAIN OF THE JORDAN.                              Area.  The Director of Surveys estimates the area of the  Valley  ofthe Jordan,  in which he  includes the Vale of  Jezreel (vide MapNo. 2 attached to this Report)  at 1,065,000 metric dunams,  ofwdiich 554,000 are cultivable.  It  is very difficult to  obtain anycomparable  figures from other  sources.   Such as  are available  areexamined in Appendix I.  For the purposes of the present enquiry a committee,  consistingof  the Government Geologist, the chief Agricultural Officer,  theIrrigation Officer and  an agricultural chemist,  was  appointed  to enquire into and report upon the extent of irrigable lands in  thesouthern part of  the Jordan Valley.  They report that there  is an area of roughly 100,000 dunams which may profitably be irrigated,in addition to the present irrigated area, between the Dead Sea andthe southern boundary of the Beisan area.  Of this 28,500 dunamsis land included in the  Beisan chiftlik.   The  balance is  71,500.Already  some 54,000  metric dunams  are under  irrigation in  thelower Jordan Valley.   Adding to this latter area the 71,500 dunamsof  the Committee&apos;s report  and the 388,517 dunams of the BeisanAgreement  areas, the total cultivable  area of  the whole jordan valley reaches 514,017  dunams.                            Character.  The  land in  the  north  of  the  Jordan  Valley   is  veryfertile; in  the  south, with  irrigation, it will  grow  all kinds of tropical fruits, and early vegetables.  Properly developed the jordan valley might prove a  great source of wealth to the country.  Inancient times it undoubtedly supported a large population.                   (c) THE BKERSHEBA REGION.  Area. This is  estimated  at  3,200,000  dunams,   of  which1,500,000 cultivable.  The figures  are in  fact pure guesswork,  asis  admitted  by  the Director of Surveys.  Possibilities. Given  the  possibility of  irrigation there is  prac-tically an inexhaustible supply of cultivable land in the Beershebaarea.  Without irrigation, the country cannot  be developed.   Upto  the present time there has been no organised attempt to ascer-tain  whether there is or is not  an artesian  supply  of water.   Ifthere should prove to  be  such a supply the  problem of  providingagricultural  land for  the Palestine  population  and,  indeed,  for alarge number of immigrant settlers, will be easy of solution.                            RAINFALL.   The rainfall varies largely from  district to district in  Palestine.In the Beersheba area it averages six inches and provides an  ex-citing gamble for the  cultivators.   On  the  coast from Gaza  toAcre its average is from fifteen inches in Gaza rising to ahout thirtyinches at Acre.  In the hills of Galilee  thirty to  forty  inches maybe expected, in the upper Jordan Valley twelve to sixteen inches,while at Jericho the  average is five inches.

800S16                        CHAPTER II.              Palestine:  The Agricultural Land.  Total Area  of  Agricultural Land. In the previous chapter anattempt has been made to provide an estimate of the extent of the hill country,  the  areas of the  five Plains  and of the Beershebaarea.   It remains to offer an estimate of the total area of agricul-tural  land,  cultivable  and  uncultivable, in Palestine.   No  exactstatement as  to these areas is  possible  until the cadastral surveynow in progress has been completed.   The  whole question of the immigration  of  agricultural  settlers depends  of  course  on  theamount of land which can be made available for them.   This againdepends  on the  difference  between the total  area  and  the arearequired for  the  existing agricultural  population, Arab, Jewishand other.  It is essential to the  present enquiry that a definitefigure, as reliable as possible, should be attempted for this purpose.  Mr. Jabotinski/s Estimate. Many  estimates have been  madeof the total agricultural cultivable area of Palestine, of which some have  been rather in the nature of  guess-work  than of estimations.Mr.  Jabotinsky   has  stated  that  the  cultivable area is  from16,000,000 to 18,000,000 dunams.  It is not known on what factsthis suggestion  is  based  nor whether the  dunams mentioned aremetric or Turkish.  It is perhaps  based on  a  statement published in the Review of the  Agricultural situation  in Palestine, 1922, inwhich Colonel Sawer  writes : &quot; We are dealing with  a total ex-ploitable land surface not  exceeding  4,500,000 acres.&quot;  ColonelSawer  pointed  out, however, that  half of  this area  had  been&quot; written off  as uncultivable.&quot;   Dr. Ruppin&apos;s Estimate. In his evidence  before the Commissionon the Disturbances, Dr. Ruppin, head  of the Colonisation Serviceof the Zionist Organisation, gave  an  estimate  of the total area ofPalestine as from 25,000 to 27,000 sq. kms., of which 12,500 kms.are  cultivable.  Of this latter  area he described 20 per  cent, asentirely uncultivated,  that is to say, that in his opinion there are2,500 sq. kms.,  or 2,500,000 metric  dunams  available  for  settle-ment.  As an annex to his statement he filed a paper showing thetotal of cultivated and uncultivated land in  Palestine.   Here again the area described as  &quot; tillable  but  uncultivated &quot;  is given as,500,000 dunams.  The statement was based on figures quoted byIjord Stanhope in the House of Lords of May 28th,  1925.  Thesedunams were Turkish dunams, and  the area  was therefore not2,500 sq. kms. as stated in the body of the  statement, but 2.29S.4sq. kms.   Lord  Stanhope&apos;s Statement  in the House  of  Lords. Lord Stanhope&apos;s statement  in the House of Lords, on which Dr. Ruippinrelied, was  in  its  turn  based  on   figures   ssuhmitted by thePalestine Government.   It  is unfortunate that these figures havebeen widely quoted and so frequently accepted as accurate.   They are in fact far  from accurate,  as  there were  no facts available atthe time from which anything in the  nature  of an  accurate esti-mate could have  been framed.   Estimate  of Commissioner  of  Lands. Two recent  estimates have been  made  in an attempt to determine more accurately the cultivable  area  of  Palestine.  Of these, one  was submitted  on April 30th, 1930, by the Commissioner of Lands, and in his letter forwarding the estimate, he discusses the question of the meaning of the term  &quot; cultivable lands.&quot;  He  includes in that term land which is actually cultivated or which  can be brought under culti- vation &quot; by  the  application of the labour  and financial, resources of the average individual Palestinian cultivator.   This definition would therefoi-e exclude marshes, the coastal  sand-dunes between Rafa and Acre, the rocky hills, the wilderness of Judaea and ex- tensive areas in the lamer part of the Beersheba sub-district south of Beersheba town.&quot;   It appears to include the wind-blown sands in the maritime  plains which  are suitable  for orange  plantations.
On this basis the Commissioner of Lands estimates  the cultivablearea of Palestine as follows : ;                                                       m.d.

The cadastral survey of Pales-tine  is now in progress  and the Director  of  that survey has  sub-mitted a careful estimate of the total cultivable area  of the country,based in part on the area already surveyed and in part on the resultsof the aerial survey to which reference has already  been made.  He arrives at the following conclusions : Type of Country.	Cultivable.	Uticultivable.Inhabited hills ... Hill wilderness ... Five Plains : (a) The Maritime Plain ... (i) The Acre Plain......

TheDirector of Surveys has applied to  whole  cartographic  areas  as measured on small-scale  maps, the same percentage as has beenfound  by large-scale survey in the large  fractions of those areasalready surveyed.  He also states that the cultivable area in the  Hills, which hasnot yet been surveyed, has been calculated  from the percentagesobtained by  close detailed  examination of aeroplane photographsspecially made  by the Eoyal Air Force  on cross-country flightsover a  number  of  tracts selected as  representative.   The  resultshave given an average percentage of  cultivable land in the tractsphotographed which has been applied to the  whole  area  of  theinhabited hills as measured on a small scale cartographically.  Thecartographical measurements of  whole  areas have necessarily  ineach  case been  made upon  previously  existing maps  and thefigure  so obtained is of course far from  exact; nevertheless,  it isprobably  much  nearer  to  the actual than the  figures  hithertosuggested, which were in fact based  on guess-work more or lessintelligent.  Dr.  Stra]ioru&apos;s figures in the Report of the Experts  to the JointPalestine Survey Commission. During the enquiry of  the Expertswho reported to the  Joint  Palestine Survey Commission, a soilsurvey of nearly the whole of the area included in the Five Plainswas made by Dr. A. T. Strahorn, whose report is found on pages143-236 of the volume of Reports of the Experts.  On page 231he  gives  the areas  of the  Plains,  excluding the Huleh  and  theBeersheba areas  and a small  portion of the Jordan  Valley, viz.,that portion lying between Wadi-es-Sherar and  Jisr-ed-Damieh.The total area which Dr. Strahorn gives for  the plains included inhis soil examination is 4,873,354 dunams, of  which 490,387 dunamsare  uncultivahle.    He  uses Turkish dunams.   Converting  intometric dunanis, the cultivable area according to his measurementsis 4,029,262 metric  dunams.  The Huleh area,  which is accepted as  80,000 Turkish  dunams of which 52,000 dunams are  marsh,would give 25,740  metric  dunams of cultivable  land.  The  totalestimate  for  tho Five  Plains,  excluding  a small  area  in  the
 narrowest part of the Jordan Valley, would thus be 4,055,002 metric dunams of  cultivable  land.   This  compares  with  the  figure of 4,094,000 calculated  by the Director of  Surveys  for  the same area, including the portion of the  Jordan Valley  omitted by Dr. Strahorn.   The  estimate  of the Director of Surveys to be accepted  for purposes  of this  Report. For  the  purpose of this  report  the estimate of the Director of Surveys  will be accepted.   The irri- portant areas  are  those  of the cultivable land of the Hills and of the Five Plains.  The Beersheba region need not enter  into con- sideration for the present.  It will be the subject of reference later. It is  clearly not  an area in  which settlement  is  possible  at the present time.  The total area in which settlement might be possible if there be land to spare amounts to 6,544,000 dunams  in the Hills and in the Five Plains.  Area  of Agricultural  Land  held by  Jews. According to  Dr. Ruppin&apos;s  statement before  the Commission on  the Disturbances, the total area held by the Jews was at that time  1,200,000 Turkish dunams, of which  1,000,000 was cultivable.  Of the cultivable areaof Palestine, excluding Beersheba,  the Jews therefore held at that time  14.04  per cent.   Since  Dr. Ruppin made his statement  afurther  50,000 metric  dunams have  been  purchased  on  Jewishaccount, and,  in  addition, some  80,000 to  85,000 dunams are under option  of purchase.  Thus  the  total  percentage  either inJewish possession  or under option amounts to over 16 per cent, ofthe whole cultivable area in these two regions.  Area  available for non-Jewish cultivators. Of this total,  whichis not less than 1,300,000 Turkish  dunams, 20 per cent, may be deducted to allow  for areas possibly  uncultivable.   The balancewill be 1,040,000 Turkish dunams equal to 956,000 metric dunams.Deducting from the estimated  cultivable area of 6,544,000 metricdunams a round figure  of 900,000  metric dunams on  account of jewish  holdings,  an area of  5,644,000  metric, dunams  remainsavailable for non-Jewish cultivators at the present time.

CHAPTER HI.                   Palestine: The Population.   Ge nsus of 1922. The last census was taken in 1922, and showed the  total population as  being 757,182,  of whom  590,890  wereMohammedans, 83,794 Jews and 82,498 Christians and others.  the division  between the town and  agricultural  population  was asfollows :         Town areas:     Mohammedans    ...............  139,074     Jews......    ...............   68,622     Christians and others    ...    ...     ...     ...   56,621       Rural areas :     Mohammedans     ...    ...    ...     ...     ...  451,816     Jews ...     ...    ...    ...    ...     ...     ...   15,172     Christians and  others     ...    ...     ...     ...   25,877  Population in 1930. There has been a very considerable increaseof the population since  that  census was taken, an increase due tonatural causes and  to immigration.  In Appendix 4 are given thefigures of population year by year, taken from the  records of theDepartment of  Health  of the Government.  The totals for mid1930 may be accepted as approximately the following :     Mohammedans    ............     ...   692,195    Jews ...    ..................   162,069    Christiana and others    ......     ......   91,72-7                                                   945,991
  Distribution of population. In this estimate the Bedu population has been taken at the same figure as in 1922.  The local distribu-tion of this population is as follows :     Urban population  ...    ...     ...     .  .     ...   340,962    Rural  population  ...    ...     ...     ...     ...   501,968    Tribal population  ...    ......     ...     ...   103.331The  total gives the  average population  of 94 per sq. mile, and,omitting Beersheba and  the Southern Desert, about 155 per sq.mile.   In Appendix  2  the  figures of Jewish and Arab populationhave  been examined,  and  it  has been  calculated that  the ruralArab  population of the Hills and the Five Plains is 478,390.  Vital Statistics. The following figures  give the average  birth,death, and infantile mortality ratios according to religion during theperiod 1923 to 1929 inclusive :-	Moslems I Jews j Christians; Others &quot; hole j country.

The figures are interest-ing and important and that  from more than one  aspect.  In thefirst place it is noticeable that the excess of births over deaths is most  marked  (25.35)  among the most numerous  section of thepopulation, namely the Moslems.   The corresponding figure for theJewish population is 22.44.   The next noticeable point is the very-low death rate among the Jewish population.  This is without doubt in part due to the large number of vigorous and young immigrants,of whom that population is composed to a material extent.  Finallythe figures of  infantile  mortality are  interesting.   The  Jewisiiaverage for the past seven years is 110.25 per thousand, but duringthe years  1928 and 1929 the  figures  were 95.8 and 89.78.   InEngland the corresponding  figure for  the year  1929 was 74, inGermany 97.  Comparative   Infantile  Mortality figures. The following tablegives  some comparative figures : Year.	Country.

A return from  thevarious  district authorities  and the Director of Health indicates that  this average  is  5.5.   Applying this figure,  the number  of families  resident in the agricultural  areas in question is 86,980 thisyear.   Fellah  families  cultivating. An  enquiry has  been made  by aCommision  appointed by   the  Palestine  Government  into theeconomic condition of agriculturists  in 104 representative villages.In these villages there reside 23,573 families, of whom 10,633 haveholdings and 6,940 have not, that is to say, that there are in thesevillages 29.4 per cent, of families who live, not directly by cultiva-tion,  but by labour either  in the village or outside and in  otherways.   Everywhere  there   is  the  complaint that many  of thecultivators have lost  their  land.  Doubtless  this  29.4 per  cent.includes these landless men who previously were cultivators.  If a deduction of 29.4  per cent, is made  from the  total  of  86,980families  reached above,  the balance is 61,408  families actuallycultivating the  land.   In addition,  there  are a  large number of families  which  should  be, but are not, cultivating the land.
                              HEALTH.    At the time of the occupation Palestine was a country saturated  with  malaria.   Since  that  time much good  work has  been done,  not only by agencies of the country, but with the help  also of out-  side scientific enquirers.  The  Rockefeller Foundation,  the League  of Nations,  the Jewish  Joint Distribution  Committee  have  all  rendered invaluable assistance  in  investigation, in research and in  advice.   Very much has been done  in the drainage of swamps and  marshes, in great part by Jewish agency and in  great part by the  Government.   The  Supreme Moslem  Council  has  also taken  a  share, and  its work in the drainage  of  the extensive and  very  malarious swamp at Wadi Rubin, under the advice  of  representa-  tives  of the Rockefeller Foundation, has been a  complete success.  A similar work of  even greater magnitude which is now nearing  completion is the drainage of the Kabbara Swamp by the P.I.C.A.  The  Zionist Agency was  responsible, among other w-orks, for  the  drainage of large areas in the Vale of Esdraelon.   The Government  Department of Health revolutionised certain areas of the Jordan  Valley at comparatively small cost,  by  draining of marshes.    Much, however, still remains  to be done.   Huleh is  a plague spot.  The malaria of that part of Palestine will not be finally overcome  until the Huleh Lake is drained and there is a  free flow of water outre  of the Basin  into the Jordan River.  There  are wide areas in the  neighbourhood of Acre  where drainage is necessary.  There are still  swampy areas in the Maritime Plain.    The second of the preventable diseases which takes a heavy toll  in Palestine is trachoma.   This  disease is  being combated with  great vigour all through the Jewish (Settlements and  in the towns.  In  the village  schools of the  Government also  the  eyes of the  children are examined  periodically by competent physicians.  The  work  of the  hospital of the Order  of  St.  John at  Jerusalem  is famous even  beyond the boundaries of Palestine.   Generally speaking, the health of  the population of Palestine  is  the object of more attention than is  the case in the great majority -of Oriental countries.   Once the malarial swamps are drained, and when  the Arab  villages  become   more  accustomed to  demand medical care than is the case at  present, the  position  will  be com- pletely satisfactory.   It  is the  good fortune of  the  Government  that  the Jewish organisations provide such an effective service for their own people. It would be impracticable for  the Government to supply anything on a similar scale with the funds at its disposal.   In its report for the year  1928  on the administration of  Palestine, submitted  to the Council of the League, His  Majesty&apos;s Government wrote  the fol- lowing : &quot; It has been the policy of Government to rely as far as possible on  private and Municipal Hospitals  and Dispensaries to furnish general  medical relief to  the population,  and  to  devote Government funds to such  services  as isolation hospitals for serious infectious  diseases,  special  clinics  for  trachoma  and  epidemic ophthalmia, the treatment  of the endemic syphilis which exists in many of the villages and of malaria  in rural  areas.  For certain sections of the population,  however,  such  as the  Beduin  tribes, which would otherwise  lack medical  attention  altogether, Govern- ment establish special clinics, and circumstances arise from time to time  in which assistance  to voluntary  organisation  for  general assistance is necessary.&quot;   The country is fortunate that there is so much of voluntary assist- ance  as is found in Palestine.   It appears question;-Me  whether with a  large growth of the  Jewish population,  which is proceeding by natural increase, apart altogether  from immigration, it  will be possible for the Jewish agencies indefinitely to maintain expenditure at its present scale.  It will clearly be impossible for  the Govern- , ment ever to undertake  medical  services to  the Jewish population&quot;on a scale more liberal than that  applied to the rest of the popula-tion. but a time will surely come  when the services of  the Govern-ment  will  be compelled  to  extend their radius of action, so as to.include Jewish settlements  as well  as Arab villages.
   Meanwhile such funds as can be  made  available will doubtless be applied to the  drainage of the  malarial swamps  which  still remain.   There  is  a  distinct  relation  between  the  economicefficiency of a people and its health.  Its vigour is seriously affectedby malaria.  If  the  country&apos;s  agriculture is  to be developed,  that development will be easier and more efficient if the rural popula-tion can be freed from the  scourge of malaria.   To this extent thediscussion of the health of the people  is germane to  the presentenquiry.   The following is an extract from the report of the Department ofHealth for 1929,  an advance  copy  of  which  has been furnished by the Director.  It is interesting  apart from considerations ofhealth :-      &quot; The Village and Colony population both Arabs and Jews was clearly    in financial difficulty.  The Arab, though not starving,  is beginning to    feel the effects of the normal  increase in population, which has  been    so remarkable a feature  in Palestine during  the last few years.  He    has no money to spend on his village,  and so there  has been  little    public health development.  The situation  in the Jewish  Colonies oon-    timies to show  a certain stagnation, and the sanitary  conditions in    the Colonies particularly  those in  which the old  huts  have  not given    place to masonry buildings,  have clearly  deteriorated on account of    the poverty of the colonists.   More especially is  this marked  in the    newer colonies in the Haifa Plain and in the Emek  . . . .  &quot;   In considering the figures for the Jewish population,  it should beborne in mind that this section of the population of Palestine  enjoysthe services of a highly efficient Jewish  medical and Health service in addition to the  normal services afforded by the  Government.  Itis  served by the  Kupath Cholim,  a  branch of the Jewish LabourOrganisation, which maintains dispensaries,  a  hospital  and  a  con-. convalescent home for the working classes.   It is served by the JewishHadassah  Medical Organisation,  which  not only maintains  fivehospitals at various centres staffed by 34 doctors and surgeons,  maleand female, but  also has a veiy efficient service which takes care ofthe child from its infancy and follows it through the kindergarteninto  the school and from the school into the home.   The activitiesof the Organisation are widespread and  highly laudable.  But someof the credit for the remarkable figures dealing with the  health ofthe Jewish population must be accorded to the children&apos;s houses inthe Kvutzoth, the communal colonies,  where the care  of the  child is  entrusted to the hands  of competent trained  nurses.  Whateveropinion  may be  field of  the  principles which  govern communal societies  such as the Kvutzoth represent,  no two opinions can beheld as to the efficiency with which the  children are treated in these colonies.   In inspecting them  one could not but be struck with the obvious vigour and health  of the rising generation.    Generally it may be  said that  Palestine  is extraordinarily for-unfortunate in the provision  for its medical needs.  Mention  lias  beenmade of the Hadassah.   The Health Department of the  Government is staffed  by a Director, a Deputy-Director,  an Assistant Director, six Senior Medical Officers,  a specialist surgeon,  a  Government analyst,   40  junior  Medical   Officers.  There   are   Government&apos; Hospitals  at  Jerusalem  and  Haifa,  and  Municipal  Hospitals, assisted and administered  by  the Government,  at Nab his, Gaza, Beersheba and Acre.    In all,  including the  hospitals administered  by  the Hadassah and  the Government, there are 38 hospitals in Palestine.  Of these, five  are  special  hospitals (two  mental hospitals,  11.7  beds; one tuberculous diseases hospital,  53 beds;  one ophthalmic hospital, 45 beds; one leper hospital,  60  beds) and  the  remaining 33,  with 1,692 beds, are available  for  the general needs  of the population. This gives one bed for 559 persons.    It is noticeable that the main concentration of medical assistance of all kinds is  in the towns.  Private medical  practice does not extend to the Arab villages.   These are dependent in  the main on the  services of  the  Government Medical  Officers.    The  Jewish settlements are, however,  well provided for in this respect, and that population, probably more than  in  any other country, has  ample medical  assistance at  its door.    Among  the complaints  made by Arabs one had reference to the enormous influx of Jewish doctors into the country, an influx which
S008was stated to have deprived a number of Arab qualified practitionersof their practices.   The population of Jaffa is about 33,000; of Tel-Aviv, the Jewish suburb of Jaffa, which is now&apos; a separate Municipalarea, 40,000.  In 1922  there were registered 25  medical practi-practitioners in Jaffa and 24 in Tel-Aviv.  In 1929  the respective numberswere 32 and  147.   That is to say, that for 73.000 people there are179  medical practitioners, or one to  every 408 inhabitants.   It isclear that the number of new practitioners cannot but have affected the  practice of the existing Arab doctors,  the more so as it is veryrare for a Jewish family to call in an Arab doctor.  On the otherhand, it is said that the  Arabs have no aversion to the employmentof Jewish medical men.   For the whole of Palestine there are 631  registered medical practi-practitioners; of these there  are 147 in Tel-Aviv, 140  in Jerusalem and75 in Haifa.                         CHAPTER IV.                    Land Tenure in Palestine.  Categories of land. Agricultural land in Palestine falls into oneof five main categories, namely :        (1)  Mulk.       (2)  Miri.       (3)  Waqf.       (4)  Metruke.       (5)  Mewat.       (6)  Mesha&apos;a.  1. Mulk.  Mulk represents English freehold.  The absolute ownership restsin the private individual, who can  dispose of it  as he likes, exceptfor a restriction on disposition by will.  The amount of agricultural land held  as Mulk is small and for the purposes of this enquiry is negligible.  2. Miri.  Agricultural property is  commonly  held by Miri title.  Miri isproperty  over which the right of occupation  or of tenure can  beenjoyed by  a private person,  provided that  such right has beengranted by the State.   The  absolute ownership  remains vested inthe  Government, but  the grant is  in perpetuity,  provided thatcertain conditions are observed.  Of these, the  chief is continuouscultivation.   If the  land remains unproductive  for three consecutive-tive years it may revert  to  the  State.   In that  case if  may  be redeemed by the possessor on payment of the unimproved capital value.   If not so redeemed  ft is sold at auction to the highest&apos;bidder (Land Code, Article  68).  It is not thought that the area!of Mahlul* land  is material.   Freedom of  disposition is allowed in            *&apos; i.e., Miri land which has  reverted to the Government.the case of Miri land, with the exception that land of this charactersmay not be bequeathed by will or constituted as Waqf.   3. Waqf.   The following  is abstracted from a note furnished by Mr. Justice E. C.  Tute :-     &quot; . .  . . Both  mulk and miri lands gave rise to dedications known as     Wakfs. A wakf is a transfer of ownership to  the Deity for a purpose     which  is,  or may  become,  charitable  or  religious.  Some WakTs were     charitable or religious foundations from the start.  The majority however;     were,  and  are, made  as  a  means of  securing the use  of the land to     the founder and his heirs along a line of inheritance laid down in the     Wakflah or instrument of dedication.  In  these V/akfs the charitable or     religious object does  not materialise till  the founders  line becomes     extinct.       &quot; Wakfs are broadly classified  into Sahih, or true Wakfs, and Ghair-     sahih, or imperfect.  The  former arise from  the dedication  of mulk     property; the  latter from tho dedication  of miri.  As miri property  is     owned by tho  State, dedication can only be made by its  head.  It took     the form of setting aside some benefit attaching  to the land, generally     tho tithe, for  tho use of the object of the dedication.  The mnlk owner     had of courso the  power to dedicate as and when ho pleased, and he  still     retains that power . . . . &quot;
  The area of agricultural land dedicated as &quot; true Waqf &quot; is cora-paratively insignificant.  In the whole of Palestine it is not claimed to extend to 100,000 dunams,  and, in fact, the extent is probablymuch  smaller.  The revenue from over one hundred villages, inaddition to shares in many others, had prior to the occupation, beendedicated by or on  the  Sultan&apos;s authority.   These fall  under  the category Waqf  Ghair-Sahih (imperfect) and the result is that  asum in the neighbourhood of  ; 30,000, representing  the Tithe inrespect of these village lands, though collected by the Government,is diverted from the Treasury to  the Waqf administration of  theSupreme Moslem Council.  The  land  itself  in  all  cases  remainsMiri and is subject  to all Miri dispositions.  4. Metruke.  Land  left for roads,  or assigned as the common land of  the village, as, for instance, for pasture, is known as Metruke.  Suchland cannot be sold by an individual nor is any  disposition possible.  5. Meicat.  Mewat has a certain importance  in that its area, which is not yetdetermined, may be considerable.  It is the waste land  (which  hasnot been left or assigned to the inhabitants or held by Kushan)at such a distance from the village site, that  the voice of a manshouting there  cannot  be heard.   This has been interpreted  byjudicial decision, as  one  and a half miles.  The land is vested inthe  Government.   Cultivation  with  permission entitles  to  theissue  of  title-deed  (Kushan) free  of charge.    Cultivation  without permission under  the old  Mohammedan law entailed payment ofthe unimproved value.   Now, under the provisions  of  the MewatLand Ordinance of 1921, any person breaking up Mewat land with-out permission is treated as a trespasser.  The area of  Mewat  will  only be finally determined  when  thement operations now in progress are completed.  6. Meshaa.  A common feature of the proprietary  right in agricultural land isthe existence of the system known as Mesha&apos;a.  In  villages where this system prevails, the whole of the  property held  in the villageis held in common.  Each shareholder owns a fractional  share inthe village, but has  no  separate parcel of land allotted  to him inproprietary  right.  The  village as a whole belongs to the body ofthe proprietors  as a  whole.  The  individnal&apos;s  share is  usually ex-pressed in terms of various measures;  a sharer may own a fedan(an area so large that a pair  of cattle  can plough it in one day),or a karat, that is l/24th of the whole, or a fraction  of the whole,called  a sehem.  But none of these represent defined plots or parcelsof the village; they represent  an undivided share of the total.  In  the Mesha&apos;a villages there  is usually a  permanent  divisionamong the Hamulahs the tribal  divisions of the village.  within these  large  areas individual shares are divided usually  every  twoyears, with the result that no development  is  at all  possible.  Nocultivator will proceed to manure  or improve  his holding,  whichhe  knows will pass to some other cultvator in the course of  thenext two years.  This Mesha&apos;a system is a constant cause of complaint among thefellahin.                            MESHA&apos;A.  Its partition. Partition can be made in one  of two ways, either by  agreement among the parties and acceptance of that agreement by  the Courts,  or by the  Courts themselves.   In the former case there  has to be unanimous agreement  of all  the shareholders.   Inthe  latter  case the Courts  act  on the  petition  of  the  individualshareholder, but the cost to him is exceedingly  heavy, for several reasons.  In the first place, it has never been the custom to registerchanges of  title upon transfer of property or succession.   Most ofthe titles now held by proprietors  are not actually in their  name.Very  frequently they are  in  the  name of a  father, or a grand-father, or other relation who is long  dead.  Before partition  canbe effected  it is necessary that the title should be clear.
8C0S  Expense of partition. Apart  from the difficulty in establishing the title, the registration of the amended  title  costs 3  per cent.of the value of the property by way of registration  fees.   Again,before the Courts will  proceed to a  partition they demand  a  mapprepared  by  a qualified surveyor.   This map has to be  furnished by the applicant for the partition.  In addition, there are  the Courtfees for  the partition, which are themselves not negligible.  Insum,  the applicant for partition by  action of the Courts is  put tovery serious  expense as a preliminary, and  is quite uncertain how long the proceedings  may last and what the  ultimate r-result will be.  Unofficial  partition. There are a large number of  villages  inwhich de facto partition  has been carried out, although  no  officialsanction has yet  been given.  In the majority of cases  these parti-tions  are  unsatisfactory from the agricultural point of view.  As inall  Oriental  countries there  is in Palestine  a universal desire that each  shareholder should have a  share,  however small, of each  dis-tinctive class of  land.  The result is that the plots  of individualsare scattered here  and there throughout  the village, and are  fre-quently either of ridiculous shape or  too small for effective exploita-tion.   Cases are known of fields being so divided that a share is2,000 metres long  and 4i metres broad.  There are cases of thiskind even where partition has been  made by Government officers,as,  for   instance,  in  the  Beisan  area.   This  is  exceedinglyunfortunate.  Partition  by agreement. It is of course desirable that  partitionsshould be made by agreement, in which case the procedure is simpleand inexpensive, and the cost of the Courts  is avoided.   As a pre-liminary  a survey of the  area to be partitioned  is necessary.  Insanctioning  these partitions  it  is essential  that  the influence ofthe sanctioning officer should be used  to correct the tendency todiffuse and  uneconomic partition.   It is said that this is difficult.One case has been cited  in  which the  fellahin were persuaded tore-distribute the  land so as to amalgamate the holdings,  thus con-stituting economic blocks.  It was a long and tedious process,  andthe officer concerned was of opinion that it had  taken  three times as long as an ordinary partition case. The matter is of such extreme importance  that it  is well worth while to spend a large amount of trouble to ensure satisfactory partitions.  Its extent, effect. A return of the year 1923 showed that of the villages in Palestine at that time 56 per cent, were Mesha&apos;a  and 44per cent.  Mafruz (i.e., divided).   A return of the present year shows46 per cent. Mesha&apos;a and 54 Mafruz.  This is an indication of thenumber  of  cases in  which private partition has  been carried out.These partitions are not  final.   They will doubtless  become so byprescription, after a  lapse of a considerable  interval of  time.   Thisis not a satisfactory  position.  Mesha&apos;a is described by the &quot; Committee on the Economic  Con-dition of Agriculturists &quot; as &quot; perhaps  the greatest  obstacle to agricultural  progress in Palestine.&quot;  They  record that the  systemmisses alike the advantages of  individualism and of co-operation;while it remains, they say, it is useless to expect that land  will beweeded or fertilised, that  trees will be planted, or, in a word, thatany  development   will  take   place.   These  opinions  are  heldgenerally by the Area Officers and District Officers of the palestine government and by the  fellahin concerned. &apos;   Government action  in  regard to  partition. In the year 1923,a  Commission was  appointed by the Government to consider thewhole question of Mesha&apos;a.   It  made certain radical proposals, in-cluding  the  recommendation that legislation should  be introducedempowering the executive authorities to enforce partition.   It sug-gested the appointment of local committees  to carry out  the parti-tions, and a reduction of taxation in respect of fees  of registration and of survey in  partitioned lands.   It also suggested that theWerko tax  should  not be raised on newly partitioned lands  until ageneral assessment of the tax is undertaken.   Nothing whatever appears to  have been done  as  a result of theenquiry  and report of this  Commission.  This is to be  regretted,as  it  is  essential  that  every   possible  step should be  taken toencourage the development of Arab  holdings.
44  Partition under  land  settlement. At present there is a settle-ment in progress, but its proceedings are so complicated and difficultthat many years will pass before they are completed.  The Settle-rnent Officers have power to deal with these cases.   It would prob-ably prove profitable to  put on a special staff of selected officers todeal with Macha&apos;a and partitions, or to empower the Area and Dis-trict Officers to deal with these cases on the spot.   It is quite cer-tain that  one of the essential pre-conditions of development is thatthe land shall be partitioned and  that partitions shall be effected onreasonable principles.  Acceleration of partition. The matter should form  the subject of immediate and  serious consideration by the Palestine Government.In  passing legislation it would be well, if at all feasible, to avoid the nomination of committees.   These are notoriously ineffective,both as executive or as quasi-judicial bodies.  It would be preferable to grant to Area Officers, and, under their supervision and control,to District Officers, power necessary  to enable them to deal withpartition  cases.   Some right of appeal will be necessary  in  case of parties who feel themselves  aggrieved, but resort to the civil courtsshould  be discouraged  as  far  as  possible.  It is  preferable, iffeasible,  that appeals  in  partition cases  from  decisions of AreaOfficers should  lie  to the  District  Commissioner,  from  DistrictOfficers to the Area Officers.         THE LAW GOVERNING AGRICULTURAL TENANCIES.  Landlords. Though it is known that very  large areas are  heldby resident and non-resident landlords, the total area cultivated bytenants has not yet been ascertained.   It will only  be known whenthe survey and settlement  at present  in  progress has been com-pleted, and if the proposals on this subject contained  in this report are accepted.  Tenants. No occupancy right exists in favour of the Arab tenantin Palestine.  As an almost invariable rule he holds his land on ayearly tenancy, terminable  by  his landlord at will.  Lands  Transfer  Ordinance, 1920. Several  attempts have beenmade  to  improve  the  position of the agricultural tenant  in thisrespect.  In September, 1920, soon  after the establishment of theCivil Government,  the Land Transfer  Ordinance, 1920, was issued.The Preambles of  that  0&apos;rdinance recite       (a) in order to meet  the  needs of the people it is desirable    that  transactions having in view the immediate use and cultiva-    tion  of land be permitted;       (b) it  is  necessary to take measures  to  prevent speculative    dealings in land and to  protect the present occupants;       (c) a  Land  Settlement Court  is shortly  to  be established,    which  will adjudicate  all  titles,  and  in  the  meantime  no    guarantee of title can be given by the Administration ;       (d) it  is  intended to introduce  legislation to  secure  orderly    planning of the towns  and the erection of buildings, subject to    the control of  the administration;       (.&apos;:) the Administration, if taking measures  to facilitate  the    establishment  of Credit Banks in Palestine, which shall have    power to grant security on  immovable  property,  pending  the    consideration of the establishment of such Banks, it is desirable    to continue the prohibition of the  sale of land in satisfaction of    a mortgage or in execution of a judgment.  Restriction on transfer of land. The Ordinance  then  proceeded to provide for  the control of all land transactions.   To all suchtransactions  the consent of  the  Administration must be obtained;this consent was given through  the  District Governor,  where  hewas satisfied that the person about to  acquire the property (1) wasresident in  Palestine, (2)  would  not  obtain  property exceeding in value i-3,000 or in area  300 dunams,,  (3), intended  himself to culti-vate the  land  immediately.  It w7as  also a condition  (4) that  thetransferor, if in possession, or the tenant in occupation of the pro-perty leased, would retain sufficient land in the district or elsewherefor the maintenance of  himself and his family.
  If an  application  was  rejected by the  District Governor, anappeal lay to the High Commissioner, whose decision was final.  The High Commissioner also had the power to consent to the saleof large areas of land, if he was satisfied that the transfer was in thepublic  interest,  or he  might refer an application for any such dis-position  to a Commission which existed  at  that time, and whose duty it was  to  report  upon  closer  settlement of the land.  Complaints against restrictions. From the beginning there was general protest on the part of the Arabs against these restrictions onthe sale of the land.  They alleged  that  they  were designed toimpoverish the  Arab  population and  to  compel the  sale  of their land to the Jews  at  an inadequate price.   These complaints were also formulated before  the  Commission of Enquiry  which reported on  the riots of 19-21.   That Commission  wrote as follows :-      &quot; The Arabs have  regarded  with  suspicion  measures taken by the    Government with the best  intentions.  The transfer of Band Ordinance,    1920,  which requires that the consent of the Government must bo obtained    to all dispositions of immovable  property, and forbids  transfer to other    than  residents in Palestine,  they regard  as having been introduced^to    keep  down the price of land and to throw land which is in the market    into the hands of the Jews at  a low price &quot; . . . .  (Command  Paper,    1540/1921, p.  51.)   Transfer of Land Ordinance,  1920-21. The Ordinance was sub- sequently  amended,  and  was replaced  by the Transfer  of  Land Ordinance, 1920-21.   The Director of  Lands  was  constituted as the authority to grant permission for dispositions of land, and he was bound to gran: that consent if satisfied  that the transferor had a title,  &quot; provided that, in the case of agricultural land which  is leased, he shall also satisfy himself that any tenant in occupation will retain sufficient land  in   the  disirict or elsewhere for the maintenance of himself and his  family &quot;   This  Ordinance in  fact  remained  a  dead letter.  It was cir- cumvented in one of two ways; either  the  landlord,  who desired to dispose of his  land, ejected his  tenants as a  preliminary  opera - tion,  and so  sold the la*id with  vacant  possession  to the  pur- chaser,  or the landlord or  the purchaser induced the tenant  to withdraw on payment  of compensation.  In both  of  these cases there  was no  tenant in  occupation,  and  the  conditions of  the Ordinance consequently failed to operate.   Protection of Cultivators  Ordinance,  1929. The latest attempt to protect the  tenant  in cases  of sale by the landlord  is  the  Pro- tection  of Cultivators Ordinance,  1929.  This  cancelled  the  pro- vision  of the  Ordinance of 1921,  which  required that,  on  sale, arrangements should be  made  to  provide a tenant  in  occupation with land in lieu of the  holding from which he was dispossessed. It aims at  protecting  the cultivator wdio  has  been at.  least two years in  a holding, by  requiring the landlord  to  give  him a  full year&apos;s notice before the tenancy can be terminated or before the rent may be increased, and by providing for compensation for the tenant for distiubance and for improvements, which he has  carried our. himself.  It  provides  further that where the  tenant has culti- vated a holding for  five years  or more, the landlord shall pay him additional compensation of a  sum  equal  to one  year&apos;s  average rent.          PROTECTION  OF CULTIVATORS&apos; ORDINANCE, 1929.    Its practical effect. This Ordinance is of little  value in pre- venting the displacement of tenants from the soil.  There is no  record  of tenancies  in Palestine, as there is, for  instance, of agri-  cultural tenancies  in India.  It would be  extremely difficult  for  any tenant to establish a tenancy of five years on the same holding.  In any case,  at its best, the ordinance would only provide money  compensation, while what is eminently required is, not  compensa-  tion for disturbance, but a provision against disturbance.                     AGRICULTURAL TENANCIES.    Occupancy  right. One  of   the  requirements  of  agricultural  Palestine at the present time is an effective provision for occupancy  right in favour of the tenant.    The pressure on the soil  is so great  that,  as will  be shown  later,  rents  are rising to a height which
800327threaten  to  preclude  the tenant  from  producing sufficient froma  holding to pay the  charges thereon and at the same time  tomaintain  a standard of life  that  is even  tolerable.   Under theseconditions any provision short of occupancy right is of little value.And if occupancy right be granted it must be secured by  a pro-vision  preventing the  increase  of rents  without sanction  of theCourts, otherwise the right of occupancy  will prove  nugatory.   Occupancy right: Position of Jewish agricultural  fcnants. Inthe case  of  Jewish tenants  conditions  are much better than  inthat of the Arabs.    The Jewish  tenant  of the  Keren-Ivayemeth(Jewish National Fund) has  not yet got any document authorisinghis holding or specifying  its conditions, but it is certain that hewill ultimately be furnished  with a lease, of which it is intended that the term will be 49 3&apos;ears&apos; renewable.  There is no  questionof uncertainty of tenure in  this case.   The P.I.C.A. either sellsland to the occupant, payment  being made by instalments  over along term of years, or provides him with a long-term lease.  Infact, the  Jewish settlement  is in  the interest of the occupant  ofthe soil, while the Arab enjoys no such advantage.   Occupancy right:  Its  effect. There  is thus  no   necessity for legislation for  conferring  the  occupancy right on   the  Jewishtenant.  At  the  same  time,  legislation providing for  the creationof such occupancy right generally would not in any way interfereeither  with the policy of the  Jewish landlord or with the amenities of the  Jewish tenant.   It is true that the creation of occupancyright will  effect a very radical change in the position of the Arabtenant  vis-a-vis his landlord.   It will also  reduce  the  market valueof land occupied by tenants.  It  is,  however, the only  measurelikely  to  arrest  the present  tendency to divorce the fellahin fromthe soil.   Agricultural tenancies:  Register of tenants. It will entail notonly the preparation of a register of existing tenants  but also thenecessary machinery for keeping that register up  to date.   It is inany case  desirable that such  information should  be available, as itwill enable the Government to watch  the movement of the agri-cultural population from the soil to the village or the town.   It willprovide invaluable information  as to the  course  of rents,  and  so will enable periodical revision of any tax  on  land  which may  be imposed.   It will be  an essential of  any  efficient policy of agri-cultural development.  It is  desirable that this register of tenantsshould  be prepared by the  Settlement staff in the case of settle-ments now in progress, and  I advise that  this  should  be done.   Palestine:  Survey. At the  present  time a survey  of palestine is in progress, which will afford invaluable information, of whichthe want has always  been felt seriously with  regard  to the areasof the country   hand settlement. There  is also a  settlement  in progress.  its main objects are two; the first is to obtain an exact  record of therights of  all  proprietors of agricultural land, the second, to providea  basis on  which a reasonable system of land  taxation  can  be founded,  in  order that the  antiquated systems  of Tithe  and  ofWerko may  be abolished.   hand registration fees. As  to  the first  of these objects,  it maybe said that the  settlement results!  will  prove  of   strictly  tem-porary utility,  as long  as   the existing  fees  on registration  of transfers  and dispositions of land remain in  force.   One  of thechief reasons for the  avoidance of registration of title in  the pasthas been  the expense which  that  registration  entailed  on  theapplicant.  In Appendix 6 the rates of fee for registration of various kinds  are detailed.  It will  be  seen  that they  are  in fact veryonerous.   Land registers.-It  is highly desirous that, once  the record  of rights  prepared  by the settlement officers is  complete, its  main-tenance as an accurate record shall be easy.  Otherwise the recordwill very rapidly again become inaccurate.  For  this reason, it isdesirable  that the fees to be  charged on the registration of changesin  the  record should be so light that  they will not prove  to be ;\serious charge   on  the  person  to whom a  property has  beentransferred.
  Maintenance of record of occupancy  right. It has been sug-gested above that the village records should include a record of tenants as well as one  of  the  proprietors.    If this  proposal is accepted,  it will be necessary to have  a  machinery to keep the tenants&apos;  register up to date.  The same agency  might deal withthe owners.  Responsibility for  application for  amendment  of theregister should  not  be removed from  the shoulders of  the pro-proprietor or  the  tenant, but  the  official  who  is charged with themaintenance of  the records  will  be in a  position to bring to  noticethose cases in which that responsibility is not  in fact  discharged.If a penalty were to attach  to failure in this  matter  of applicationfor amendment of the  register, and at the  same time there existedan  official  in a  position  to  know the facts,  there should  be little difficulty  in/ keeping  the  registers  accurately  up   to date.  an accurate  record  of this kind will be  of  untold  value, not only tothe authorities but, and  perhaps even more importantly so,  to the proprietors and to the tenants of  the village.                        CHAPTER V.                Jewish Settlement on the Land.  Agencies of Jewish  Settlement. Areas,  being Jewish propertyeither of the  various colonisation agencies or of private individuals,are shown on map No. 6.  The two chief  agencies of Jewish  settlement  on the land arethe PALESTINE JEWISH COLONISATION ASSOCIATION,commonly known as the P.I.C.A., and the  Colonisation Depart-ment of the  ZIONIST  ORGANISATION, which  is financed  bythe Keren Mayesod.  The former  buys land and instals settlers;the latter is  purely a settlement agency, the land being purchased by  the Palestine Land  Development Company for the  JewishNational Fund, which places it as  required, at  the  disposal of thethe Keren Hayesod.  The former  buys land and instals settlers;land is improved by the Keren Kayemeth (J.N.F.).  In addition to these two major agencies of settlement, there area  large  number of land or settlement  companies which eitherdispose of land in small  lots to would-be  settlers, or prepare and plant the land and sell  it, either when planted, or when  matureand bearing, to immigrants.  Private agencies: The Benei-Beyijamin. There are also  a  num-ber of private agencies which  prepare land for  settlement, as  forinstance the Benei-Benjamin.   This is a society of young Jews,having members both in Palestine and abroad.  It has borrowed money and has purchased a  tract of  9,000  dunams  of land, whichit is preparing and planting,  for settlement of other members of theSociety who hope in time to come to Palestine.  It is  intresting to observe the difference in  policy between such a  society as this one and an ordinary commercial society, such as Palestine  Planta-tions,  Limited, which has acquired a large area and is  developingit as orange  plantations for  sale to immigrant Jews.  The formersociety has its plantations in the village of Nataniya, in the Mari-time  Plain.   It charges its members   85 per dunam for developedorange groves at the end of  the  5th year, when  the trees  are coming into  bearing.  The trees are  all grafted.  Tel Mond is  thecolony where the  plantations  of Palestine Plantations, Ltd.,  are situated.   It was ascertained  from the Company&apos;s local managerthat for similar groves of the same age the price  is  110 per  dunam.   Amount of land held by Jewish  organizations. From the infor-niation received from the Jewish agency in Palestine and from  thePalestine Land Development  Co., Ltd. (a purchasing agency  notonly for the  Jewish National Fund but for many of the public and private companies), it appears that in June, 1930,  Jewish  land inPalestine amounted to 1,250,000 dunams.   The Statistical Abstractof  1929 gave an  area of 1,200,000 dunams.  Though this fact isnot stated in the Statistical  Abstract  or in the Memorandum sub- mitted by the  Jewish Agency, it has  been ascertained that  thedunams referred  to are not  metric dunams,  but  Turkish dunams.   In addition to this land so held, the various Jewish agencies hold .options over a  further area  of between 80,000 and 85,000 metricdunams.
                (1)  THE  P.I.C.A. SETTLEMENTS.  Of the various Jewish settlement agencies the largest and mostimportant  is  the P.I.C.A.,  whose colonies  number  34.  this association commenced work in 1882, under the designation of TheJewish  Colonisation Association (I.C.A.), and  its operations since that date have  been supported by generous  expenditure  on  thepart of  Baron Edmund  de Bothschild.  The  P.I.C.A.  now owns454,840 metric dunams of land.   To the activities of this  organi-sation are due the foundation of the well-known colonies of PetachTikvah  and Behovoth,  which have recently developed with rapidstrides.   The  former was  in  origin  a  colony  of  28  familiessettled  on 2,000 dunams  of  land.  It has grown into a countrytowm of some 10,000 inhabitants  and  comprises 25,000 dunams ofland, of which considerable areas are owmed by private individuals.Behovoth is also extending rapidly.  At the start 20 families were settled  on 10,600 dunams;  the population of the village  is now estimated at 2,800 and the  area  attached to the  colony is 22,600dunams,  also owned in  large part by  private individuals.  Thiscolony  was famous for  its  almond plantations, and still  exportslarge quantities of  almonds through its  Co-operative  Society ofAlmond Growers.   The almond industry is now  overshadowed inall this region by the orange, and the area under orange groves is increasing with great rapidity.   Pdchon-le-Zion, with its famous cellars, and Zichron-Jacob, are other well-known P.I.C.A. colonies.   The  Kabbara  concession. The P.I.C.A.  has two importantprojects in course of completion,  both in the  Maritime Plain.  In 1921 the Association obtained a concession for the manufacture  of salt at  Athlit, for the drainage of the Kabbara swamp and for the development of  the  Caesarea sand-dunes.  The first of these pro- jects has been  transferred to a company  which is now producing salt in considerable quantities.    The drainage  of  the  Kabbara swamp and the irrigation canals which will cover this area are now approaching completion.  The total area of  land included in the Kabbara  concession  was 5,170  dunams,  and  in  addition  the P.I.C.A. already owned  2,300 dunams adjoining.  The whole area. has now been reclaimed and rendered cultivable.  At the time of my visit a large part of the area was carrying  rich crops of linseed. The drainage work  has  proved particularly difficult, owing to the discovery of springs in the bed of the  swamp for wrhose drainage subsidiary arrangements are necessary.   At one place 126  of these springs were discovered  in three  and a half  dunams of land, less than an acre.   The drainage of  all these springs has added much to the  cost of reclamation, and at the time of  my visit 4292,000 had already been spent on the work.    Pardessana. The second  project is the  development  of the Pardessana colony,  south of the  Kabbara swamp, lying among the undulating  sandy  hillocks  of  the Maritime  Plain  which are  so favourable to the growth of the  orange.  The preparation of the land for that colony, which will  provide holdings for 450  families, besides 1,000  families  of workmen, has  almost been completed. Wells have been and are being  sunk,  electric current has already been provided, both for power  and light,  and the  town site has been laid out.   The individual lots have been marked on the map, and in the case of the few colonists who  have already arrived, also on the  ground.  The work reflects the greatest  credit on  those responsible for it, and, given the possibility of creating a sufficient  market  for  the largely-increasing supply of Jaffa  oranges, the  future of this  colony is  most promising.    A feature of Pardessana is the provision of  small lots for familwi of the labouring class.   An area of 5 dunams with cow-house and  poultry-house,  it attached to each  of  the  woi-kmen&apos;s dwellings,  which are composed of two rooms and  a kitchen.    Benjaniina. Similar provision  is made  for the labouring class,  in this case Georgians,  in the colony of Benjamina, lying south of  Pardessana.   In  that colony a  perfume factory  has been started,  successfully, and  both  the  colonists and the labourers have been  encouraged  to reserve  a small  area for  jasmine,  and have been  instructed both in the method of cultivation and in that of plucking  the flower.  The  produce of the factory is  stated  to be of good
S^OS:ioquality, and to sell for high prices  in France or in England.   Theactual  profits to the grower are not very large, as cultivation andplucking absorb much labour  and occupy much time.  The indus-try is, however,  well suited for  allotment  holdings  such as  those with which the labourers are provided.  Colonies in  Galilee. Apart from its colonies in the MaritimePlain  the P.I.&apos;C.A. has established a  number  of  settlements  in upper and Lower Galilee.   These are chiefly of the old-fashionedtype,  with  somewhat  extensive  holdings,  and  grow  principallycereals and other  country crops.   In  some  of  the colonies thesettlers are  acquiring cross-bred cattle  of  a superior type,  which provide an income from dairy produce.   In most of these coloniesArab labour  is employed.   Bitania. One of the P.I.C.A.  settlements, named Bitania, inthe  Upper Jordan Valley, deserves  special mention.  It  contains an experimentail  area in which fruit of various kinds, and the more valuable  vegetables tomatoes,  cucumbers, egg-plant are   beingcultivated.  It has been found that the land of  this colony,  which lies  to the north  of the Jordan Valley and not far from the Lake ofTiberias, is specially suitable for the cultivation of grape-fruit andbananas. The grape-fruit of  Bitania is  first-class in  quality,  almostseedless, with the  minimum  of pulp, of fair size and thin-skinned.Its flavour is excellent.  It has also been ascertained by experimentthat the fruit can be  stored and kept in good condition at least until the month of June.  These results of the experimental cultiva-tion of the grape-fruit are most important, for the  soil  is unsuitedto the orange and the grape-fruit provides an even  more valuable crop.   Relations of P.I.C.A. Colonists  zcith Arabs. The relations of the old P.I.C.A. colonists with  their Arab neighbours  and with their Arab  workmen  were excellent a mutual advantage to both com- munities.  Had the P.I.C.A. policy of friendship and  conciliation with  the Arab been permitted to continue, there is no doubt that in the neighbourhood of their colonies none of that bitterness which is now so prevalent need have  arisen.                   (ii)  THE ZIONIST SETTLEMENTS.    The Jewish National Fund. The Jewish National  Fund holds approximately 270,000 metric dunams.  According  to  a  statement submitted  by the Jewish Agency and reproduced as  Appendix 7 to  this Report, there are 20 co-operative groups, 16 smallholders&apos;  settlements, 5 girls&apos; groups, 4 Yemenite settlements, 2 agricultural  settlement stations and 2 experimental stations.  In addition, there  are 9 settlements described  as &quot;  supported &quot;,  On the  other hand,  the  statement  submitted by the Jewish  National Fund  (Keren-  Kayemeth) records the following  :      &quot;  The types of settlement on  the  land are  as follows :          18 smallholders&apos;  settlements;         27 co-operative group settlements;          7 Yemenite settlements;           Agricultural experimental station and its branches.&quot;     Zionist settlements. The settlements  of the  Zionist organisa-   tion have  not been at  work for as long  a time as  those of the   P.I.C.A., and  they work on different principles.   The outstanding   principle  is &quot; self-labour &quot;,  which  implies  that  no  settler  shall   have more land than the area he is able to cultivate by the unaided   labour  of himself and his family.   In the case of  the co-operative   group, the  area is determined by the amount which  the  group is   able to cultivate without assistance.  In addition,  notwithstanding   the  fact that the settlers receive a certain agricultural training as   &quot; chalutzim &quot; (i.e.,  pioneers) before  arrival in Palestine,  they are   not by early training agriculturists. They are  drawn from  all walks   of life.  There is no lack of ardour or enthusiasm, and there can be   no  doubt that in time the settlements will be able to support the   cultivators, especially in those districts where plantation is possible.   Meanwhile, there are few if any, of the settlements which  are truly   self-supporting,  and there appear to  be none in  which  any  pay-   ment has been made in  respect of the outlay by the Jewish National   Fund  or  the Keren-Hayesod.
  Expenditure  by  Keren-Kayemeth  and  Keren-Hayesod. Theamounts spent by  these two agencies  have been formidable, andit is quite impossible that they will ever be repaid in full.   In theformer case no question of repayment arises, as the land is not tobe sold to the settlers.   Yet it is certain that no adequate  interestcould be paid by the settlers on the outlay of  the  Fund on theirholdings.  The same is  the case with the expenditure of the  Keren-Hayesod.   The outlay  has been  lavish, and   the  whole  of  thecolonies are so over-capitalised that it  will prove essential  both to write off a considerable  amount  of the outlay and to fix the  rate ofinterest on the balance  at an uneconomic  level if the outlay  is ever to be liquidated. The Jewish National Fund and the  Keren-Hayesodhave very  kindly  submitted consolidated  statements of  their  ex-penditure, which are printed as Appendices 8 and 9 to this  Report.In  the former, excluding the  items &quot; Urban  Land &quot;, &quot; UrbanBuildings &quot;,  and  &quot; Lands  &quot;,  the  sum of  1,545,659 appears  tohave been spent on agricultural colonisation.   In  the latter,  the items &quot; Urban Colonisation &quot;,  &quot; National Organisations &quot;, &quot; In-vestments &quot;, and  &quot; Jewish National Fund &quot; do not appear to  beexpenditure  on colonisation  in the  country.    The balance  is 3,345,531.  Adding these two sums  together, the  total  cost  ofagricultural colonisation by  the Zionist  Organisation appears  tohave been  4,891,190.*  The number of persons actually  settled  *  The whole of this sum has not bsen expsnded on families actually settled.  it includes an amount spent on laud still in resjrve.for  this sum is shown in Appendix 10 a statement submitted bythe Jewish agency.  Population of settlements. The total population of the Zionistsettlements in 1930 (included  therein being the &quot; supported settle-ments &quot;)  consisted of 4,408 adults,  and 2,344 children under 15years of age.   The cost of colonisation of a family has thus beenvery large.  Area of Zionist settlements. In Appendix 11 is produced a state-ment submitted by the Jewish Agency as to areas held.  This showsthat included in the settlements belonging to the Zionist Organisa-tion are 129,446  dunanis of  land, in addition to 14,758  dunamsbelonging to settlements described  as  &quot; supported &quot;.  These latter are settlements belonging to other agencies, private or public, for whose continuance the  assistance  of the Zionist Organisation isrequired.   Of the  129,466 dunanis actually the property  of  the zionist  Organisation,  and included  in  the  settlements,  15,137dunams are leased to others,  11,958  dunams are  shown  as fallow,and 7,390 are &quot;  idle,  fit for  cultivation &quot;,  i.e.,  in  all  34,485dunams, or 26.6  per cent, of the total of  the cultivable area ofthese settlements  was for one reason or  another not  cultivatedduring the last year by the settlers themselves.  Reserve  area. As  has been recorded, the total  area of land heldby  the Jewish National Fund is 270,000 metric dunams.  From thestatement to which reference  has already been  made, in Appendix11, it appears that, excluding the settlements called  &quot;  supported &quot;only  114,329  dunams were cultivated.  This implies  that of  theland held by the Fund over 155,500 dunams are in reserve.  the zionist  Organisation  has been engaged in  colonisation  work sincebefore the  War, though only since the War has development beenrapid.  It  has now a reserve  of land sufficient for a programme for  a number of years.  This is satisfactory, in that it  will enable a general  programme of  development to be  worked  out for  thecountry without interference with  the work of Zionist settlement.  Emek colonies and contagious abortion. A large number of the zionist  colonies are in the Emek.   They tend more and more to bebased on dairy produce, poultry, and fruit.   The question of dairy-ing will be discussed in the portion of  the Report dealing with agricultural development.  Here it is sufficient to record that  theprice of milk is falling.  The Zionist colonies  have  large herds offine cows, many of them being pure-bred Holsteins, or the Holstein-Damascus  and the Holstein-Gaulan cross.  They are heavy milkers.It  is unfortunate  that with  the cows  has  also  been   imported

80083-2&quot; Bang&apos;s bacillus &quot;, and that contagious abortion is present  in  thelarge majority of the stall-fed dairy herds.   The matter  has beentaken in hand by the Department  of  Agriculture, and  it is  hopedin time to eradicate the  disease.  Meanwhile, its appearance cannot but  affect the estimates of  the cost of settlement  and throw back the  date at which the dairy settlements  will definitely become self-supporting.  Experts&apos; opinion as to completion of establishment. On page 40of their Report the Experts wrote  as  follows :     &quot; . . . . that no  expenditure for planting new colonies should be made    unless the development of existing  colonies has been completed, or the    money  required  for their  full development has been provided.   The    amount  required for this  will absorb  the probable  normal  income of    the Colonisation  Department for several  years to come.  Delay  in pro-    viding settlers with needed equipment and improvements  is now causing    serious losses  and  disappointments. It  is  lowering the  efficiency of    the settlers,  it is the cause of large deficits, even in  the older colonies,    and is placing on the Zionist Organisation, rather than on the settlers,    the responsibility for  making the  colonies self-sustaining  .  . .  . &quot;  These remarks are still  applicable.   The. colonisation settlements in the Emek, which  were examined by those Experts, are still  not fully equipped.   Indeed, it is stated that the sum of  300,000 isnecessary  for  &quot;expenditure  during  the   next two  years if these colonies are to be  a success.  On  July 2nd,  1930, an article  appeared in the  English supple-ment  of  the Jewish  Labour paper, &quot; Davar,&quot;  the organ of  theGeneral  Federation  of Jewish  Labour,  and published  by thatFederation.   The article is entitled  &quot; At the  Bottom of the List.&quot;Referring to an article on the consolidation of the Zionist colonies in the Hebrew issue of  the paper,  the article says :       &quot; A detailed plan adopted in 1927 by  the Zionist  Colonisation Depart-    ment placed the  investments still needed  to make  all settlements self-    supporting at  499,029.  It was resolved to complete  the process within    two years .... and it  was with  this understanding  that  the above    sum was  fixed.  The Labour Movement  submitted to the necessity of    letting consolidation take  precedence  over all other activities ....    The plan was  sound, but what of  its fulfilment?   The two years have    passed, the third year is nearing its close, and the goal  is yet to be    reached.   In 1927-28  a  sum  of   136,000 was expended;  in  1928-29    another   78,000,  and  1929-30 yet  another  130,000.   this makes  a    total of   344,000, which,  being  subtracted  from  the  original  total,    leaves an arithmetical  balance of  155,000 still outstanding. But the    economic  balance is much  greater.  In  the  development of  a farm    there is a tremendous  difference between obtaining the budget in cash    so  that it can be invested productively  at once,  and  having to wait    for  windfalls,  meanwhile living from  hand  to mouth.   The present    position is that instead of   155,000, not  less  than   300,000  will in all    probability  be needed  to complete  the equipment, and again  on  the    understanding that  tho  balance  will  be forthcoming  during  the re-    mainder of the present year and the  following one ....  Now that    the time  has  come for the preliminary drafting of the Agency  budget    for the next Jewish year those responsible should know that the patience    of  the  Emek settlers  is finally exhausted, and that they insist upon    means being  found to  complete the equipment of  their farms  during    the present year . . .  . &quot;  Self-supporting Zionist settlements. In the Memorandum sub-mitted by the Jewish Agency, at page 24 the following is written :      &quot; Those  settlements  which have  received their  full equipment from    the Keren-Hayesod are now self-supporting.  The other settlements that    have not yet received  their full settlement loan are most of them by    now  very near to the  stage of being  &apos; self-supporting.&apos;  In this con-    nection we  mean by  the  term  &apos; self-supporting &apos;   that the ordinary    farm expenditure and living expenditure, including renovation, but not    including  depreciation, nor  repayment  of settlement  loan, nor rent    (which  is not yet payable), are covered  by the ordinary farm income.    In this sense the following settlements in the  valley of  E-sdraelon are    already   self-supporting,  viz.,  Nahalal,  Ginegar,  Balfouria,  Kfer    Yeheskiel.&quot;  The  Consolidation  Budget. By the  courtesy  of Dr.  Ruppin,statements  were  submitted  bringing  up  to  date  the information contained in Table I printed on  page 72 of  the  Experts&apos; Report.This table  gives,  among  other information, the  amount  of  the&quot; Consolidation  Budget,&quot; that is,  the  amount  still  necessary  tocomplete the settlement of each colony.   From the statements sub-mitted by Dr. Ruppin  it appears  that  for Nahalal  (which  is  de-ecribed  in the  Memorandum  as   &quot; self-supporting &quot;)  a sum  of 10,000 is still required.   For Ginegar the  sum is  23,000;   forBalfouria,  3,500.
  Kfar  Yeheskiel:  Cost of Settlement.   Only in the case of KfarYeheskiel can the colony be said to be  self-supporting, and  in the modified  sense  of  that word used  in  the  Memorandum.   Thiscolony contained 59 families in  1930.   In the statement on p. 72.of the Experts&apos; Report, the cost of the land and its  ameliorationfor this colony was shown at $342,090,  say  70,389.  In  the state-ment now  submitted  the  cost  of  the equipment is  shown as. 63,935 in addition.   The total  expenditure  of settling 59 familiesis,  therefore,   134,329, an average of  2,277 per family.  Keren-Hayesod: Budget. In  view of these facts, it is remark-able to find  that in the year  1928-1929 the  budget of the Keren-Hayesod for  agricultural  colonisation  fell from   167,090  of theprevious year, to  93,123, while at the same time the expenditureon  unban colonisation rose from  4,746  to  91,949.  Further, there is at present a plan in preparation with  the abjectof &quot; placing one thousand families of labourers on the land.&quot;  Thefollowing is an extract from  the  Report of the  Palestine jewish agency,  published in  the  &quot; Palestine  Weekly &quot; of  July  4th,1930 :-    &quot; .... It is also a matter of common knowledge that at the last meet-    ing  of the  Administrative Committee of  the Jewish  Agency,  which took    place  in London, it was  resolved to settle one thousand  families of    workers, by means of extra budgetary funds,  in the vicinity of the big    plantation colonies.  The plan is still in the preparatory stage . . . .&quot;   Influence  of Federation of Labour. A second criticism of the experts  was directed  to   the  submission of  the  colonisation authorities  to the influence  of the  General  Federation  of  Jewish Labour,  and  the tendency  of  to use  the  Zionist  colonies  as  a method of forwarding the Federation policy  of social reform.  This tendency is  still strongly in evidence, and will be referred to later.   Kvuizoth  Colonies. A  third  criticism is directed against the Kvutzoth, the Communal colonies.   In those colonies land is held in common,  and the community lives in one or more large  com- munal houses, one, or sometimes two,  rooms being allowed  to each couple.  For the children there is a separate children&apos;s house, wmere they are cared for by nurses specially detailed to this duty.    The work of the settlement for the  next  day is distributed each  evening among its members by the community in meeting after the evening meal, and it is understood that each member takes his or her  turn at  all the  domestic or  agricultural  duties of  the group. The employment of paid labour is against the principles which govern such communities.   At the time of writing, however, parties of boys belonging to the junior  branch  of the Federation of Labour have been deputed to some of the Kvutzoth colonies in the Emek to assist in harvesting the grapes.  It  was explained  by one of the officials of the labour executive that, on the one  hand, the  employ- ment  of labour  for  this purpose would be  too  expensive  for the means of the colony and that,  on the other hand, the outing was in the nature of a  holiday for the children and that  it had the additional effect  of  stimulating  interest in agricultural pursuits. This system is still in full vigour and new colonies of this type for the labourers  are being constructed to-day.    Smallholding colonies. These differ, of course, from the small- holding colonies, in which each family has  its separate dwelling  (in  almost all cases  surrounded by a garden)  and its separate agii- cultural lot.  In these family life is preserved.  In some there is an aversion to the employment of paid labour,  and much work is done in common, as, for instance, the threshing  of the grain at  harvest.  Many of the smallholders&apos;  colonies are highly attractive in appear-  ance and show signs of progress.  This is specially the  case in the  Maritime  Plain, where  the orange has  proved a great source of  wealth, but there are also attractive  colonies of this  type in the Plain of Esdraelon, where farming is  of the mixed type, the main  branches being dairy and vegetable  and fruit cultivation.   Even in  the smallholders&apos; colonies  there is a  keen  communal feeling, and  during the inspection of one of  these a complaint was made that  one of its members, who had failed financially and left  the village,  had sold his agricultural outfit to a stranger, without consultation  with  the village Council.   The members of  the colony expressed no
toos3iobjection  to  the  new-comer, who was in every way satisfactory.Objection was rather to the manner of his coming among them.  Emek and Upper Jordan Valley Colonies: Nahalal. Among the zionist settlements probably  the most successful and the mostattractive are some of those in  the Emek and in the Upper jordan valley.  Nahalal  is the outstanding instance of a progressive colonyof smallholders.  Founded ten  years ago, with 80 families, it nowhas 75  agricultural and  35 non-agricultural  families.   The colonyhas been well laid out.   It is not yet  completely  equipped  and housing will require a considerable outlay,  but  progress  is sub-siantiai.  The  colony commenced as a  grain-growing  colony,  but has since changed over to more  intensive methods, specially to dairyfarming and poultry keeping.  All the  grain produced  is used asfodder for birds and animals, and no grain  is now sold.  In 1922the colony had 38 cows.  It now  has about 500 and  the  income from ihe sale of animals this year has been  1,500.   The colonistsalso own over  30,000 fowls.  The average holding is 100 dunams.  At present  it is not morethan is sufficient to maintain  a  family,  but  it is anticipated thatwater  can be  pumped for  irrigation and that  when this is donethere will be room for some  further  settlers.   &quot; Regulating Societies &quot;. One feature of the colony is what are described as  &apos;&quot; regulating Societies, which afford  help  to colonistswho suffer from  sickness or from poverty.   The members arrangeamong  themselves  to cultivate the land  or tend  the animals of asick member, charging him with the cost.   If it is found that thecolonist cannot pay, the debt  is carried forward to  the following year.    Some bad debts  are made, but the Societies put  aside asum every year to meet such losses.  It was reported  that  some of the colonists  are putting moneyinto their farms.    This  argues  an  income  in excess of thatnecessary  for  the  maintenance  of the family.    The colonistshave not yet begun to repay any of the  money due  to the Keren-Hayesod  for installation, nor  is rent being  paid to  the  Keren-Kayemeth.  Kjar  Yeheskiel. Another  successful  colony in   the Plain ofEsdraelon is Kfar Yeheskiel.   Here the average lot is 85 dunams,but  6  of  the  40 cultivating  families  have  additional land in a neighbouring village.    In this village  also the basis  is dairying.The colonists own 300 cows and live  by selling the milk and theyoung  stock.  In addition many fowls  are kept and  20,000 eggsare sold on the average each month.    Some of the colonists are specialising  in fruit and  it has been found by experiment that thegrape-fruit will  flourish.   The colonists  estimate  that  the net income in cash  is  60  per family.    Repayment  to the Keren-Hayesod  and  payment  of rent  have  not  yet commenced.   Thetotal  number  of families in this village is  60,  of  whom 20 are engaged in trade or in work other than  agriculture.   Dagania A. Of another type is the Kvutzoth colony Dagania Ain the  Upper Jordan Valley.    This colony was  founded 20 yearsago.    The  area was  stated by residents on the spot  to be 7,000dunams,  of  which 800 are irrigated by pumps worked by electric power.   There are 255  residents, of whom  116 are children.  Theindustries of the  village are  dairying and  fruit,  and the grossproduce was said  to be   20,000 per annum.    Bananas  are thestaple fruit of the colony and do well.   This colony is certainlyprospering, but here also no payments are  being made in respectof debt or of rent.   Kiryath  Anavim. A  colony  which  is  looked   upon  by  the zionist Organisation as  a great  success is  the  hill colony KiryathAnavim, a few  miles distant  from Jerusalem.  It  is a  dairyingand fruit colony, with quite a  small area under cultivation.   Thefodder  for 40  Dutch cows comes  up by lorry from colonies near to  Jaffa,  and the settlers stated  that its  cost  was  met by theincome from the  manure  of the cowhouses.   The milk  is  sold in Jerusalem.  The adult population of the village is 70.  enquiry was made on  this point, but it  was not explained  how this largenumber of colonists was occupied with work on a dairy farm with
40 cows and on a small area of fruit.   The colony was described as paying its way, and a profit of  164 was stated to have beenmade  in 1929.   It  appears,  however,  from  further  enquirythat the sum of  1,080 was earned as wages  of  labour in Jeru-ealem, that   400 is still required for consolidation, that the  outlayof  the  Keren-Hayesod  on  establishment of  the  colony  was 23,015, that the accumulated deficit is   5,115, and that nothinghas  been paid towards the debt,  or for rent.    This settlementcannot  seriously be characterised as a financial  success.  Jewish rural  population. It is  somewhat difficult to ascertainhow many Jews have been  settled  on  the land.    The Report  ofthe  Commission on the Disturbances,  at page  8,  records theJewish rural population  as  35,000, distributed  over  135  settle-ments.    On the other hand, the Vaad-Leumi, in a memorandum submitted to the Mandates Commission of the  League  of Nationssays  that  the rural Jewish population  is 46,000.    The exactnumbers will not be  known until  the census of next year, butthere can be little doubt that the figure  quoted from  the  Memo-randum of  the Vaad-Leumi is  exaggerated, as  the  total  of the detailed statements  for each settlement  submitted by  the  jewish agency with their Memorandum is 38,777.   This figure,  again,may  not be exactly accurate, but it is as near the truth  as canbe ascertained at the present time.   It is estimated by the Vaad-Leumi  that  there were 10,000 Jews in  Jewish  colonies in 1919and that since June, 1921,  and up to the  end of 1929 89,926 Jewsimmigrated into Palestine.    Disregarding any  question of  natural increase,  the increase of population in the colonies since  1921 iscertainly not greater than 28,777, that is to say, that of immigrantJews less than 1 out of 3 is settled on the  land.    The immigrationmovement is in major part a movement of  immigration  to the towns.  Zionist Settlements  not  self-supporting. Of  the  agriculturalsettlements it  may  be said that  none of  the Zionist  settlementsare self-supporting in  the sense that they would  be able to main-tain  themselves without  further  assistance and  pay  back  to theKeren-Hayesod a reasonable amount towards satisfaction of theirdebts,  and  to the  Keren-Kayemeth an  economic rent.    It  is indeed  admitted that  no such consummation is  anticipated.    A&apos;large majority of Zionist settlements would cease to exist if furthersupport were not forthcoming.   The P.I.C.A. colonies, however,include in their number several old colonies which are radicallyestablished,  and which will unquestionably flourish in  the future.Even with  the P.I.C.A. colonies, however,  there  are  a number,including some of the older colonies,  which still require  support and  in some cases reorganisation.   I  understand that this re-organisation is in progress.  Excessive cost of Zionist settlement. The  system  adopted bythe  Colonisation Department  of  the Zionist Organisation  is im-mensely costly ;  it demands very  little  from the settler himself.Indeed however hard a settler may  work, and however desirous hemay be to  pay back  sums that the Fund expended on him, by no  possibility can he  arrive at that result.   The debt which heowes cannot be repaid by any effort on his part.  Jewish settlement in Russia. It  is interesting to  compare theprinciples  and cost of Jewish  settlement on the  land in  Russiawith the similar  cost  and  principles  which obtain in Palestine.Jewish colonisation is proceeding  on a  large scale  in SouthernRussia, under  the  auspices of  a Joint  Distribution  Committee,known in its  colonisation  activity  as  &quot; Agro-Joint.&quot;   Conditions.are of  course  different, as the Russian  Government supplies thenecessary land free  of charge.   Apart from the land,  it is costing 150- 200 to settle  a family on the land in Russia.   This in-cludes  preparing  the  land (tractor operations  and well-sinking)though in a number of cases the digging of the wells is done bythe settlers  themselves.    Of the total expenditure on settlement82.25 per cent, is  described as &quot; returnable expenditure.&quot;    Thebalance represents  expenditure  on  what  is called &quot; agriculturalextension &quot;  and  on administration.   The latter item  amountsto  the  remarkably reasonable  percentage of  6.64 per  cent,  of
the total  expenditure.    It  is recorded in a  report  for 1926 thatthe new settlei-s of the 1923-24 season were  already paying theirdebts.*  * Report by Joseph A. Rosen, Director of the Agro-Joint, submitted to  dieChicago Conference of the United Jewish Campaign, October, 1926.   In a report on the work in  Russia by  J. Billikopf  and Dr.Maurice B. Hexter, written in 1926, the following occurs :       &quot; It is to be noted that nothing is donated outright to the settler    except technical instructions and medical assistance; other  than techni-    cal and medical aid all  else is  charged to a settler&apos;s account, of which    the colonist has current information.&quot;   Settlement of  refugees  in  Greece. Similarly, in the case  ofthe  Greek  refugee  settlement,  all  the  money  spent  on  settle-ment  by  the Refugee Settlement Commission is repayable.    Ithas  recently been arranged that  the actual overhead expenses  ofadministration shall not be repaid by the agricultural refugees, northe  cost of construction  of certain major  works  of  public  utility,as  for instance  an  irrigation  canal and arterial roads, but that,as a general rule, all other expenditure on  the settlement  of theindividual  family, including  the  price of the  land,  shall  be re-covered.    Repayment  is  actually   in  progress.   The  cost  of settlement  of  the agricultural  refugees in  Greece  amounted onthe  average to less than   85 per  family, but this sum  did  not in-clude the price of the land,  and  about  half the houses were pro-vided  by  the Government, being houses evacuated by  exchangedTurks and Bulgarians.   These houses, however, required  radicalrepairs.   Expenditure on settlement and effect of non-repayment. It is undesirable,  from the point of  view of ordinary morality,  thatcolonists  should  be  allowed  to benefit  by the  large expenditure which has been  made for  their settlement and yet to escape pay-ment of  the amounts spent upon  them.   Nothing could be worse than that the  Jewish immigrants should feel that they have theright to  be established  in Palestine at the expense  of  others.There is  a danger  that this  view  will prevail and  that  settlerswill look upon what is described as the &quot; inventory,&quot; this is, pro-vision for their settlement, as  a right.  If a strong, healthy and self-respecting peasantry  is desired in the Jewish colonies in Pales-tine, it should be made  unite  clear to them that they are underthe  obligation to  repay the outlay which has been made  on their behalf.   (iii) THE EFFECT OF THE JEWISH SETTLEMENT ON THE ARAB.   P.I.C.A.&apos;s relations with the  Arab. In discussing this questionit  is essential to differentiate between the P.I.C.A. colonisation andthat of the Zionist Organisation.   In so far as the past policy of  the P.I.C.A. is concerned, there canbe no doubt that the Arab has  profited  largely by the  installation of the colonies.   Relations between  the colonists and  their !A&quot;rahneighbours were  excellent.  In many cases, when land was  bought&apos;by the P.I.C.A. for settlement, they  combined with the develop-ment of the land for their own settlers similar development  for theArabs who  previously occupied the land.  All the cases which arenow quoted by the Jewish authorities to establish the advantageouseffect of Jewish colonisation on the Arabs of the neighbourhood, andwhich have been brought to  notice forcibly and frequently  duringthe course of this enquiry,  are cases relating to colonies  establishedby the P.I.C.A., before  the  Keren-Hayesod  came into existence.In fact, the policy of the P.I.C.A. was one of great  friendship forthe Arab.  Not only did they develop the Arab lands simultaneously with their own,  when founding their  colonies,  but they employedthe  Arab  to tend their plantations, cultivate  their fields,  to plucktheir grapes and their oranges.   As a general rule the P.I.C.A&apos;.&apos;colonisation  was  of  unquestionable benefit  to the  Arabs  of thevicinity.   It  is also very noticeable,  in  travelling  through  the P.I.C.A.villages,  to see the friendliness of the relations which exist between
Jew and Arab.  It is quite a common sight to see an Arab sitting in  the verandah  of  a Jewish  house.  The position is  entirely different in the Zionist colonies.  Zionist colonisation: the Arab. In the Memorandum  submittedby the Jewish agency attempts were made to establish that the pur-chase  of the  villages  in the  Esdraelon valley and their settlement by  the Jews had not  had  the effect of causing the previous tenantsto join the landless class.  A  list  of the  ejected tenants was sub-mitted as an annex to the Memorandum, giving the subsequent em-ployment of each  one of  these tenants in so  far as  they could  betraced.  The  annex dealt with 688 tenants.  The following is  an extract from the Memorandum :      &quot; . .  . .  Very  few traced belong to  the landless class; 436  are con-    tinuing farming 53 as harraths; 89 are shepherds they were  all shep-    herds before the evacuation, farming being with them a  merely sub-    sidiary  occupation;  4 are  merchants; 50 are urban labourers; 4 are    vegetable vendors; 10 are camel drivers; 2 are milkmen;  37  died;  41    whereabouts unknown.  In addition, out of the 6?S not less than 154    have become property owners that is, they now possess  a house and  lot    of  their  own.&quot;  In explanation of the above statement it must be pointed out thata &quot; harrath &quot; is a farm servant; he is not a tenant farmer.  Thereal result  of this  enquiry is to establish that of  688 Arab  familieswhich cultivated in the villages in the Vale of Esdraelon which werepurchased and occupied by the Jews, only 397 are now cultivatingthe land.   Three hundred and nine of these families have joined thelandless classes.   In  the  cases described  as  &quot; died &quot; it is not the family that is extinguished, but the head of the family who  hasdied.  Presumably, the descendants are still alive and earning theirbread in some other walk of life than  agriculture.  It is also to be recorded that the  number, 688,  does not by  any means include  allthe families who were displaced.  According  to the  records of theArea Officers  at Nazareth and Haifa, the number of &quot; farmers &quot;displaced from-those  villages w-as 1,270, nearly  double the numberaccounted for in the  Memorandum.   In addition to  farmers, thereare, of course, many other residents who,  though not in occupation,have interests in  the land.   With reference  to  these the &quot;district commissioner, Northern  District,  w:rites :     &quot; .... It appears quite clear that the persons who claimed, or at any    rate who received compensations, by no means included all those who    had interests in  land, who according to the census figures amounted to    4,900.  The census figures are usually taken as being about 20 per cent.    below the  truth, owing  to  the  objections  to a census  which  was con-    neeted with military service . . . .&quot;   Government  responsibility   towards   Arab   cultivators. TheJewish authorities have nothing with which to reproach themselvesin  the matter of the  Sursock lands.   They paid high prices for theland, and in  addition they paid to certain of the occupants of those lands quite a considerable amount of money which  they were not legally bound to pay.  It was not their business, but the  businessof  the Government to see to it that the  position  of  the  Arabs was not  adversely affected by the  transaction.  In  Article  6 of the Mandate if is the  duty of the  Administration of Palestine to ensure&quot;that the&apos; rights and  position  of the Arabs  are  not  prejudiced by Jewish  immigration.  It is  doubtful whether, in  the matter of  the  Sursock lands, this  Article  of the  Mandate  received sufficient consideration.    P.L.D,Go.&apos;s attitude toioards Arab  cultivators. The question of  the treatment of Arab cultivators on the lands purchased by Jewish agencies  for  development and settlement is already  one  of im-  portance,  and will become  increasingly important  as further pur- chases are made.  It is  a question which intimately concerns  the  good government  of  the country, and one to which the Administra-  tion of Palestine  will doubtless direct its attention. The importance  of the question was  brought forcibly to notice by Mr. &quot;Hankin, an  agent of  the Palestine Land Development Company.   In a letter  dated 14th July,  1930, he writes :      &quot; . . .  . Had we desired to disregard the interests of such workers of     the land  as are dependent,  directly or indirectly, upon lands of the     landlords,  we could have acquired large and unlimited  areas, but in the     course  of our conversation I have pointed out to you that this has not     boen our  policy and that,  when acquiring lands, it is our ardent wish
800338   not to prejudice or do harm to the interests of anybody.  We feel it our   duty to settle the workers and enable them  to continue their agricultural   occupation, either in the same place  or elsewhere.    But we have tho   possibility of acquiring  100,000 dunanis without having to make  any   settlement for the tenants, since the acquisition of such an area will not   cause harm to anybody and  will not oust anybody from his lands; only   after this area has been acquired wo shall have to see to a proper settle-   mont for tho  tenants . .  . .&quot;  The above is a translation from a Hebrew letter sent  subsequent to an interview, of which the note records that  Mr.  Hankin said :&quot; . .  .  . it is possible still to make arrangements for settling Arabsof 100,000  dunams which we  may purchase  .... but not after that.   Then it will  be necessary  to make arrangements  for theArabs,  as for the Jews, on the land purchased.   They will have  tobe colonised, as the  Jews, but it  will be cheaper.  For the Arabworker,  150;  for  the  fellah,   300;  for  the Jewish worker,   300;for the Jewish cultivator,  600 to  700 .  .  . .&quot;  At  a later stage  of this report the question of the sufficiency  ofland for Arab  cultivators will  be examined.  It is sufficient at thisstage to record the  fact that Mr. Hankin, who has probably a moreintimate  knowledge  than any other Jewish representative  of thefacts regarding agricultural land, is of the opinion that  the balanceof land available for settlement at the moment is  100,000 dunams atthe outside.   The effect of the Jewish colonisation in Palestine on the existingpopulation  is  very intimately  affected  by the conditions on whichthe various Jewish bodies hold, sell and lease their land.   The Constitution of  the Jewish Agency: Land Holding and Em-ployment   Clauses. The  Constitution of  the Jewish  Agency forPalestine,  signed at Zurich  on 14th August, 19-29.  Article 3 (d)and (e) read as follows :        &quot; ((/)  Band is  to be acquired as Jewish property  and subject  to the    provisions of Article 10 of this Agreement, the title to the lands acquired    is to be taken in the name of the Jewish  National Fund, to the end    that the same shall be held  as the inalienable property  of the Jewish    people.       &quot; (c)  The  Agency  shall  promote agricultural colonisation  based  on    Jewish labour, and in all works or  undertakings carried out or furthered    by the  Agency,  it shall be deemed  to be  a  matter of  principle that    Jewish  labour shall be employed .  . . .&quot;   Keren-Kayemeth draft lease: Employment of Jewish labour only.  I have  been favoured  with copies of the draft of the lease which it is proposed to execute in respect of all holdings  granted by the Keren-Kayemeth  (Jewish   National   Fund).   The  following  is Article 23 of  this lease :      &quot; . .  .  . The lessee undertakes to  execute all works connected with the     cultivation  of the  holding only with Jewish labour.  Failure  to comply     with this duty by the employment of non-Jewish labour shall render the     lessee liable to the payment of a compensation of ten Palestinian pounds     for each  default.  Tho fact  of the employment  of non-Jewish labour     shall constitute adequate  proof  as to  the damages  and the amount     thereof, and the right of the Fund to be paid the  compensation referred     to, and it shall not  be necessary  to serve on the  lessee any notarial or     other  notice.  Where the  lessee has contravened  the  provisions of this     Article three times the Fund may apply the right of restitution of the     holding, without paying any compensation whatever.&quot;    The lease  also  provides that the  holding shall never be  held  by  any but  a Jew.   If the holder,  being  a  Jew,  dies, leaving as his  heir a non-Jew, the Fund shall obtain the right  of restitution. Prior  to  the enforcement of the  right of  restitution, the Fund must give  the heir three months&apos; notice, within  which period the  heir shall  transfer his rights to a Jew, otherwise the Fund may enforce the  right of restitution and the heir may not oppose  such enforcement.    Keren-Hayesod  Agreements:   Employment  of  labour. In  the  agreement for  the repayment of  advances made by the  Keren-  Hay^esod  (Palestine Foundation Fund)  to settlers in the colonies in  the Maritime Plain the following provisions are included  :         &quot; Article 7. The settlor  hereby  undertakes that ho will  during tho      continuance of  any  of the said advances, reside  upon the said agricul-      tural  holding and do all  his farm  work by himself or with the aid of      his family, and that,  if and whenever he  may be obliged to hire help,      he will hire Jewish workmen only.&quot;
  In the similar agreement for the Emek colonies there is a provi-sion as follows :        &quot; Article 11. Tho settlor undertakes to work  tho sniil holding person-    ally, or with tho  niii of his family, and  not to  hire tiny outside labour    except Jewish labourers.&quot;  Zionist policy  in regard to Arabs in  their colonies. The above-quoted provisions sufficiently illustrate the Zionist policy with regardto the Arabs in their colonies.   Attempts are constantly being nnuloto establish the advantage which Jewish settlement has brought tothe  Arab.  The most  lofty  sentiments  are  ventilated  at public meetings  and in Zionist propaganda.   At the time of the ZionistCongress in UhJI u  resolution  was passed which &apos;* solemnly declaredthe desire of the Jewish people  to  live with tho Arab people in reln-tions of friendship  and mutual respect, and, together  with  the Arabpeople, to develop the homeland common to both into a prosperouscommunity  which would ensure the growth of tho peoples.&quot;   this resolution is frequently  quoted  in  proof of the excellent sentimentswhich Zionism cherishes towards the people of Palestine,  The pro-visions quoted above, which are included in legal documents  bind-ing on every settler in a. Zionist colony, are not compatible with thesentiments  publicly expressed.  The  same  remark  applies  to  the  following  extract  from theMemorandum  submitted  by  the  General Federation of  JewishLabour to (he &quot;  Palestine Commission of Enquiry &quot; (i.e.,  the  Corn-mission on  the Palestine disturbances  of  August, 1929) : -      &quot; Tho Jewish Labour Movement considers tho Arab population  as an    integral element in  this country.  It is not to ho thought of that Jewish    settlers should displace this population,  nor establish themselves  at its    expense.   This would  not only ho impossible  both  from  tho political    and economic standpoint, but  it would  run  counter to tho moral don-    coption lying at tho root of tho Zionist  movement,  Jewish immigrants    who come to  this country to live  by thoir own labour regard tho Arab    working  man as  thoir compatriot and fellow worker, whoso needs are    thoir needs and whoso  future is their future.&quot;  The  effect of the  Zionist  colonisation  policy  on  Ilia  Arab. Actually  the  result of  the  purchase of land  in  Palestine  by theJewish  National  Fund  lias  been  that  land   has  been  extra-territorial isod.  It  ceases to  be land from which  the  Arab can gainany advantage either now or at any time in the future.   Not onlycan he never hope to lease or to cultivate it,  but, by the  stringentprovisions of the lease of the Jewish National Fund,  he is deprivedfor ever from employment on that land.   Nor can anyone help hintby  purchasing the  land  and restoring it to common use.   The hindis in mort-main and inalienable.   It is for this  reason that Arabsdiscount the professions of friendship and goodwill on  the part ofthe  Zionists in view of the  policy which the  Zionist Organisationdeliberately adopted.   Reasons for the  exclusion of the Arab. Attempts were made toascertain  the reasons lor these drastic provisions directed to excludeevery Arab  from  the  hind  purchased,  Tho  Executive  of thoGeneral Federation of Jewish  Labour were perfectly frank on thosubject.   They  pointed  out  that  tho Jewish colonies were foundedand established  by Jewish  capital, and  that tho subscriptions ofwhich this  capital  is composed were given  with  tho  intention thatJews should emigrate to Palestine and  ho settled there that  thesesubscriptions would never have boon given had it boon thought thatthey would  be employed to support Arab labourers that it was thobusiness  of  the. Zionist Organisation  to  cause  immigration into palestine of as  many Jews as possible,  and that  if Arabs  were em-ployed posts  would thus bo  filled  up  for  which Jows might haveimmigrated that tho position  of the  agricultural  labourers in thocolonies,  when  occupied  by Jows, sorves as a training for thoimmigrant  and prepares him  to  take  over a holding himself at alater date-and, finally, that if these posts wore  left  open to thoordinary competition of the labour market, the  standard  of life ofthe Jewish  labourer would bo liable to fall to  tho lower standard ofthe  Arab.   Policy  contrary  to  Article 6 of  Mandate. All tbeso argumentsare  thoroughly  logical,  and  have a basis in fact.  They aro,  how-ever,  irrelevant, in  view of tho  provisions  of  Article G  of thoMandate.   Tho  principle of  tho persistent and  deliberate boycott
of Arab labour in the Zionist colonies is not only contrary to theprovisions of that article of the Mandate, but  it is in  addition a constant and increasing source of danger to the country.  At themoment this  policy  is confined to  the  Zionist colonies, but theGeneral Federation of Jewish Liabour is using every effort to ensurethat it shall be extended to the colonies of the  P.I.C.A., and this with some considerable success.  Great pressure is being brought tobear on the  old  P.I.C.A. colonies in the Maritime Plain and itsneighbourhood pressure in  which  in  one  instance at  least hascompelled police intervention.  As a symptom of that pressure maybe cited the &quot;construction of a labour Kvutzoth  (communal colony)on the outskirts of the P.I.C.A. village of Ness-ziona.  It is certainthat the employers of that village will not be able to resist the argu-ments of  the  General Federation, reinforced by the appeals of thevigorous labour colony at its gates.  That this  replacement of Arab labour by Jewish labour is adefinite policy of the Zionist Organisation is also evident from thefollowing quotation,  taken  from &quot; A Guide to Jewish Palestine  &quot;,published by the Head Office of  the Keren-Kayemeth  Leisrael The Jewish National Fund and the Keren-Hayesod at Jerusalemin 1930 :-    &quot; ....  up to tile end of the -war  the  old plantation settlements  em-    ployed practically only Arab -workers. The transfer of Jewish  labourers    into the old villages has been a source of constant care of the Zionist    Executive,  -which  latterly  succeeded in placing  approximately 6,500    workers in these centres, chiefly in  the  form  of Havureth, i.e., closely    organised  groups, which contract with  farmers  for specific  pieces of    work,  and are themselves  settled on small farms.  Under this category    come also the Yemenite settlements near the plantation villages . . .  . &quot;   It  will be a matter of great  regret if the friendly spirit  whichcharacterised the relations between the Jewish employer in  theP.I.C.A.  villages and his Arab  employees, to which reference  hasalready  been  made, were  to disappear.  Unless  there  is some change of spirit in the policy of the Zionist  Organisation  it seems inevitable that the General Federation of Jewish  Labour,  whichdominates that policy, will  succeed in extending its principles toall the Jewish colonies in Palestine.   The present position, precluding any employment of  Arabs inthe Zionist colonies, is undesirable, from the point of view both ofjustice and of the good government of the country. As long as these provisions exist in the  Constitution of  the  Zionist Organisation,in  the lease of the Keren-Kayemeth and in the agreement of theKeren-Hayesod it cannot be regarded as desirable that large areas ofland should be  transferred  to  the  Jewish  National Fund. It isimpossible  to  view  with equanimity the extension of  an  enclave in Palestine from  which all Arabs  are  excluded.  The  Arab popu- lation already regards the  transfer  of lands to Zionist  hands with dismay and alarm.   These cannot  be dismissed  as baseless in the light of the Zionist policy which is described above.                     (iv) GOVERNMENT  LANDS.              The question of the Government  lands.   The Jewish Agency, and the Jewish community in general, are insistent in pressing their  claim to all lands in the owmership of the  Government.   A list  of these lands,  and of other  lands to which Government  lays claim, or to which it has laid claim in the past are  entered in Appendix No. 12 and are shown on  Map No. 1.                        Huleh and  Beisan.    The lands fall into various categories.  The question of Huleh and of the Beisan lands is discussed at length in another portion of this  report.    In  both of  these  cases the  position  is  a &quot; fait  accompli &quot;.   If  the  Government  wishes  to  obtain  proprietary; possession  of the former Government lands in the Huleh  Basin, it will either have to await the problematical chance of the denunciation- tion of the  concession, or  to purchase  the rights of the concession- naire.  In the case of the Beisan  Chiftlik lands, the Government can only regain possession  by purchase, or by expropriation on payment of compensation.   There were the  two most important  and valuable  areas  of Government property, and are still those to  which the eyes of the Jewish organisations are turned with longing  and with invincible expectation.
                        Chiftlik Estates.  Of the areas still remaining, there is a class of property,  whichthe Government has leased to.the Arabs on the spot.  The Govern-ment claims ownership.   These Arabs have  been in actual posses-sion for  very  many years, and in  certain cases claim that theyhave rights, and have made application  to be treated in the same manner as the  tenants with whom the Ghor Mudawwara  agree-ment was  made in 1921.   The following  is the  list of propertiesof this kind, with their areas :       (1)  Mansourah area   ......     ...     2,500 dunams     (2)  Kokab  area       ...     ...     ...     3,750   do.     (3)  Zalafieh area     .........     2,700   do.     (4)  Tel-el-Dahab  area       ......     2,400   do.     (5)  Deir Ghazaleh area       ...     ...     2,700   do.     (6)  Mazra&apos;a el Hamra area   ...     ...    11,300   do.     (7)  Akrabenieh  area  ...     ...     ...       960   do.     (8)  El Farnsh area   .........     1,656   do.     (9)  Sajad area............     7,000   do.     (10)  Hamadieh area   ...     ...     ...       500   do.     (11)  Zeita area  ...    ...     ...     ...     5,350   do.     (12)  Jaladiyeh area    ...     ...     ...     4,143   do.     (13)  Kofakha area     .........     9,200   do.     (14)  Muharraka area   ...     ...     ...     4,580   do.     (15)  Rafa  area  ............    90,000   do.  The Government share in the village of Kokab is 3-24th in anundivided  village.  If this  share were to be transferred the othersharers would have the right of pre-emption.  A part of the Rafa lands was offered to the Jews, but  for financial reasons was refused.   The  same is  the case with Tel Arad.  Partwas offered to  the Jews  for settlement by ex-service men, butattempts to find water were not successful  and the offer was not accepted.  In the general  development  of agricultural Palestine which willhe  recommended as  the only  solution of the  present  difficulties,the whole  of these properties will doubtless be examined in detail and will fall into the  appropriate place in the scheme  which mustbe  prepared.  It is obvious that unless development is  undertakenas  a preliminary to closer settlement, the Arabs who are now exist-ing on these  properties can neither have their holdings reduced,nor can  be expelled in order to make room  for Jewish  settlers.   Jazzair, which extends to about 418 dunams, is leased to an Arabtenant of  long standing for 20 years.   Hassaniyeh,  for which demands have  been  made,  lies  in  theSafad sub-district.  The claim of the villagers to this property hasbeen recognised and it is no longer State Domain.   Dahnuneh and Mubarakeh,  also  in the Safad sub-district, havebeen settled with a Jewish Co-operative Society on  a 50  years&apos;lease.   Their area is small.   to be-Alti, at Acre, is largely occupied by the Agricultural Station,and by  sites  reserved for  the  Central  Prison  and for the  Men&apos;s Elementary  Training  College.   The  balance  consists  of buildingsites, many of which have already been sold under a scheme initiated by the Ottoman Government.   The property of Subeih, in the Nazareth sub-district,  was of the same  class  as the group of villages on which the Arab  tenantsare allowed to remain  on payment of 10  per  cent,  of  the gross produce as rent, which have been  discussed above.   The  total area is  9,000 dunams.  Of this, 2,000 dunams have  been taken  for the Jewish  Agricultural  School, to be founded  from  the  Kadoorie Beques:.  The Government has agreed to  sell the remaining por- tion of the village to the Arabs who are  settled thereon and have been  for  at least the past century.  There  are  reported  to be 140 families,  of whom 70 are actual cultivators and the  rest graziers or workmen.   Parts  of the boundaries of the village  lands are in dispute  and are before the court.    The Government property in Rakayik has been leased  to a Jew.    The Acre Sands, 12,225 dunams, have been reserved for exchange and lease to the Haifa Bay Development Company (now the Bay- side Land Corporation) a Jewish concern.   When the Haifa Port is developed these lands are likely to become exceedingly valuable.
  The Kishon Lands consist largely, if not entirely, of  wadi bedsdrained by  the Government,  the  work  being done  as a  relief work for the Jewish unemployed in 1926-27.   These lands are only450  dunams in  extent  and should  assuredly  be  reserved by theGovernment,  in view  of  the keen  demand for land  in thatneighbourhood,  both  for Government;  and other buildings on thecompletion of the Haifa Harbour works.   The Jewish communityalready holds a large  area  of land in  Haifa itself  and in theimmediate neighbourhood.  The Rushmia, property,  an  area  of 3,385 dunams, occupies alarge area on the Carmel ridge, and  is  in the immediate neighbour-hood of Haifa.  An application for  a lease to the Jewish NationalFund  is under consideration.  In view  of the outlook for Haifa,this again will  be  a property of rapidly  increasing value.   It  isfair  that the advantage which  results of the Governments expen-diture at  Haifa should  redound to  the financial advantage of theGovernment.  This property is not  an agricultural property  in theordinary sense.  It will rapidly become a suburban property.  Thewiser course would seem to be to split up the property into  blocksand dispose of these on long lease  to individuals.   If this land isleased to the Jewish National Fund, the result will be that no Arabcan  ever  hope either to occupy a  portion of the land or  to  beemployed thereon as a labourer or workman.  Athlit,  Kabbara  and  Cesarea have already been  granted  to theP.I.C.A.  under a  concession.  Cherkaz  and  Hudeiddun are  occu-pied by the same organization.  The two latter are small areas.  The Toubas lands, in the Nablus  sub-district, are 41,700 dunamsin  extent and are  occupied by Arab  cultivators  who have   neveracknowledged the  Government claim to  proprietary  right.   TheArabs have never  paid rent and do not  do  so at  present.   It isreported to  be very questionable whether the claim of the Govern-ment has any basis.  Bassat el Yaraki is a swamp.   The total  area is 2,500  dunams.The right to  cut reeds in  the  swamp  is sold annually.  There  areclaims to grazing  rights by  certain Arab stock-breeders.    It isstated that the swamp is not capable of economic drainage.  Basset el Mulabbis is already leased  to  the  Jewish colony  ofPetach Tikvah.  There is  litigation in progress on the subject of the Jaffa sand-dunes, which cover an area  of 35,000  dunams.   These are,  ofcourse, largely  uncultivable.   An  area  of 21,000 dunams is ear-marked for  lease to the Jewish colony of Rishon-le-Zion, subject tothe result of the action in court.  The Ahata property, 15,000 dunams, lies on the road  from Jeru-salem to Jericho, in the ravines of the Judaean Hills.  The owner-ship is disputed.   The whole area is uncultivated and the  majorportion uncultivable.   There  is a large area of land in the  Jericho  Chiftlik and  EsSuwa-ideh,  chapter.ra.beh and   Jahayyer lying between the Dead sea and Jericho.  Apart from the area  irrigated  from the Ain Sultan,there is only a small area of  this  land at present cultivable, and considerable development will  be necessary to render any portion ofit fit for cultivation.  Irrigation is essential.   Of this area, 11,000 dunams were  offered to Jewish organizations,but were refused as unsuitable.   Ain Feshka, on  the Western shore of the Dead  Sea, is uncultiv-able.  The  land is  highly saline.   Near Gaza there are  6,000 dunams of sand-dunes, included in  the list of Government properties.  There is at the moment an action in  Court on  the question  of ownership.   These sand-dunes  are in the main uncultivable and  the tract is the site of the New Gaza.   The above deals in detail with all the Government properties to which the Jews have laid  claim.  Had different action  been taken in  the case of the Huleh  Basin and  the  Beisan  Lands, doubtless some portion of the demand  could have been met.   It  is  clear, however, that of the land which remains with the Government at the present time,  there is  a very small area which could be handed
over, with the exception of areas which until developed are requiredfor the maintenance of the Arabs already in occupation.   It cannotbe  argued that Arabs should be dispossessed in order that the land should be  made  available  for  Jewish  settlement.    That would amount to a very distinct breach of the provisions  of Article 6 ofthe. Mandate.  There will be an addition to  the  area of Government lands,  andpossibly a material addition, as the settlement proceeds  and areasof Mewat are determined.  Meanwhile there is practically no vacantGovernment land which could be made available, and the general idea that  the  Government  has command  of large  areas  which itcould, but will not make over for Jewish settlement is far removed from  the facts.  This myth is based  on a tradition of disappoint-ment because of the action of the Government of Palestine in regardto  the  concession of Government lands in the  Huleh Basin,  andto  the  settlement of the area  covered  by  the  Ghor  MudawwaraAgreement with the Arabs in possession of that  area.                        CHAPTER  VI.                  The Position of the Fellah.  Available information. The  present  enquiry  has  fortunatelyoccurred at a time  when the question of the economic position ofthe fellah has formed the subject of two serious investigations.  Thefirst of these has been made  by  a Commission appointed by theAdministration  which,  after  a detailed  enquiry into the positionin 104 representative  villages, submitted its  report to the Govern-ment on July 3rd, 1930.  The results of the second are recorded ina volume by Dr.  Wilkansky, head of the Zionist Agricultural Ex-perimental Station of  Tel-Aviv. This volume is not yet published in english,  but the proof sheets have  been made  available by thecourtesy of Dr.  Wilkansky for the purposes of this enquiry.  Area of cultivable land occupied by the Fellah. The question ofthe cultivable area of Palestine has been examined in another partof this report, and the estimate of the Director of Surveys has beenaccepted as the most  reliable available estimate.   He puts the cul-tivable area of  the whole of Palestine, including  Beersheba, at8,044,000 dunams.   For the purposes of the present enquiry theBeersheba tract as  to whose area little is in fact known, andwhich  depends  on an  erratic and insufficient rainfall may  be omitted,  and consideration directed  to the cultivated areas in the hill country and the Five Plains which have already been  described.The total cultivable area of these  two regions is 6,544,000 dunams.Of these at  least 900,000  dunams are already in  the possession ofthe Jews.*   There are thus  5,644,000  dunams  available for theArabs at the present time.f  This figure  differs materially from the  * Tha total Jewish holding) are reported at 1,250,000 Turkish, i.e., 1,149,000metric dmiam&apos;.    Allowing 20 per cent,  for uucultivable land, the remainderwill -xceed 900,000 dunams.  f Th re are n-rnia  areas held by German  colonists  and certain ecclesiasticalauthorities, buv they are comparatively so small  that  they need not  be  takeninto account in thin calculation.figure quoted  by the Commission on  the Disturbances on p.  113of its Deport,  and used in the arguments  on pp.  120 et seq.   The  &quot; Lot  viable &quot;. On pp. 120 and 121 of their Report thatCommission writes as follows :     &quot; .  . .  . Now, the area of land required to support tho average  family    must vary with the fertility of the soil.  From evidence given before us    it would appear that where the land is used for the purpose of growing    cereals  the  area which will provide a  living for an Arab&apos; family varies    from 100-150 dunams.  No other figures were put forward from the Arab    side, but Dr. Ituppin informed  us  that the average area of  a Jewish    colonist in  the o&apos;d  wheat-growing colonies in  Lower  Galilee is 250    dunams, in  the Zionist settlement in the Plain of Esdraelon with dairy-    farming it  is  100 dunams,  and in the  Coastal Plain, whore orange    growing is  the principal occupation, it is 10-20 dunams.      &quot; From the figures  given by the  experts who  wore appointed byl the    Joint Palestine Sxirvey Commission and who visitod Palestine in 1928,
   it would seem that the average Jewish holding of hind in the Zionist   colonies is  to-day 130 dunams. These gentlemen found that few of the   Jewish colonists were able to make a satisfactory living on their present   holding. The experts were of opinion that in many districts the area   oil the average holding should be increased.&quot;  The joint Palestine Survey  Commission, at p. 67 of their report,write the following :      &quot; Palestine experience shows that  a dry farm should have from 40 to   80 acres, whether in the Coastal Plain or in tho Kkex, and that 60 acres   is a safer  limit than 40.&quot;That is to say that in  their opinion,  the absolute  minimum for afarm in either of  those two  areas, is  160  dunams  and  that  240dunams is a safer minimum than 160.   It wall be remembered thatthe  Emek is looked upon as one  of  the most fertile regions ofthe  country.  The  &quot; Lot viable &quot;, the holding necessary to support its occu-pants in  a reasonable  standard of  life,  varies of  course  with the class of land  of which the holding consists.  Not only is  there a wide difference between the unirrigated holding necessary  for thispurpose and  the similar holding.   Among  dry holdings  some are much  more  productive than  others.   For this reason  it is im-possible to fix any holding which might be taken  as the standardholding in irrigated and unirrigated tracts respectively.   Althoughit is true that no  such  standard holding can  be taken, it  is well  toarrive at an approximate average holding for lands of various kinds.Many such averages have been  suggested,  and have been treatedas to a certain extent authoritative.  The  question of  appropriate holdings in  the various zones andfor  different  types of farming have been discussed at length in  a&quot; Key  for the Settlement of Various  Zones in Palestine &quot;, beingthe  reports  of  the Preparatory Commissions  appointed   by  the zionist Organisation to consider the question of the  preparation ofthe  land for  the settlement of Jewish  immigrants.  The  Key was,it is understood, written by Dr. Wilkansky.  On p. 6 the unit areaof the  ameliorated  colonies on non-irrigated heavy soil is  fixed  at200  to  250 dunams, though a few may  be as small as 160 dunams.On pp. 16 to 20 is discussed the unit of an  improved farm of fixedsystem.  The basis of the farm is dairying, and it is assumed thatthe  settler is supplied with six cows.   For such a  farm the unitrequired is 130 dunams.  It is added : &quot; With  land not so well im-proved it will be necessary to add 10-20 dunams according to  thefertility.  In certain districts, therefore, the  unit area  will haveto be increased to 140-150 dunams &quot;.  Again, on p.  37, there is an estimate of the area required fora farm in the stage of  transition, that is to say,  when it  is beingimproved for the  reception of the settlers.   At  that stage  onesettler&apos;s family is  put on to a double farm.  When  it is improvedhe  retains one  half and a second family is installed on  the otherhalf.  The total area of the farm is 280 to 300 dunams, the size ofthe  individual farm,  again  a dairy farm, being  from 140 to 150dunams.  For a heavy soil farm,  entirely irrigated and to support8 cows, the  area is estimated at p.  42 of the Key to be 25 dunams.Finally, at page 44, an estimate ia given of a typical farm  in a  drygrain section, with 10  dunams of irrigated  land,  and  the  arearequired is  found  to  be 80  dunams.  Here again the  basis  isdairying, with four cows.  In all the cases dealt  with in the Key,the  lot  is so calculated as to be workable by  the members of  the family without any outside assistance.   In all cases also the basicindustry is  dairying and the farm is  planned for the feeding ofcows.  The  anticipated yield of milk is in each  case considerably higher than the milk yield of the common  country cow.   Mr. Hankin gave it as his opinion that  in the Afuleh region ofthe  Vale of  Esdraelon, 10 dunams of irrigated land and 90 of  un-irrigated would support  a  family.   An  interesting  piece  of  evidence  on the subject of  the &quot;  lotviable  &quot; is contained in the negotiations between the administration and Mr. Ben Zvi of the General Federation of Jewish Labour,  on
the subject  of  a grant of land at Tel-Arad for Jewish ex-servicemen.   An area of 200 dunams per settler was demanded.   It  waspointed out  by the High  Commissioner that in  other  cases 70dunams had been  granted  to settlers.  Mr. Ben Zvi  maintained that this was where there were plantations and that the P.I.C.A.allowed 250 dunams  for each  family.     Later  he stated  that200  dunams  was  the  minimum   that   would   suffice  for  a family and this basis was accepted.  Mr.  Smilansky, in  his paniph-let  on  Jewish  Colonisation  and the fellah,  considers that  120dunams is as  much  as a  fellah can cultivate with two pair ofoxen.  He says :     &quot; .  .  . . The farming system of the fellah is in  almost all eases as    follows: He put6 under cultivation an area not exceeding that which    one ploughman with two pair of oxen can work.  As his draught animals    are very  poorly fed, they  cannot work continuously  and  he must use    his  two pairs of animals  in turn.  Whilst one pair  is at work, the    other feeds on the scant pastures, lean as themselves.&quot;This evidence does not accord with Mr. Wilkansky&apos;s description of &apos;the farming  of the fellah,  nor with  the results  of  observation inmany  villages  visited  in the course  of this enquiry.  It is a  rareexception to  find a small cultivator with two yoke of oxen.  Saleem eff Farah was of the opinion that 150  dunams of un-irrigated land is the minimum which will support the family of thefellah in a reasonable  standard of comfort.  In  the  Memorandum on &quot; Land and Agricultural  Develop-ment &quot;, submitted by the Jewish Agency, the question of the lotviable  in various areas is dealt with.   In the Emek  it is calculatedat 100 to  150 dunams.   Where water is  available, the area can bereduced at the ratio of one  dunam of irrigated soil to  four or fivedunams of dry soil.  In the  &quot; Key &quot; to which reference has beenmade  above, Dr.  Wilkansky considered one  dunam of irrigatedsoil as equivalent to three  dunams of  unirrigated soil.   In the maritime Plain irrigated areas suitable for oranges can be settledon  the basis of one  family to  15 dunams, if  only  partly suitablefor oranges one family to 22 dunams.  Dealing with the Huleh  area the  Memorandum of  the  jewish agency considers  that  25  dunams  of irrigated  heavy  soil  or 22dunams of  irrigated  light  soil  should be  sufficient for a  holding.Mr. Hankin, on the other hand, considered 40 dunams, of whichhalf irrigated,  as the  correct holding. The experts of the jewish agency are of  the  opinion that 25 dunams are sufficient in the caseof  the Beisan  and Semakh lands if  irrigated, and recommend 86dunams of unirrigated  and 14 of irrigated in that area.   On theslopes and the heights to the north  of the Haifa Semakh  railway line they consider 150 dunams necessary.   For the Lower jordan valley a  standard  holding  of 21  dunams is suggested.  This sug-gestion is made tentatively and admittedly without close detailedknowledge.   The most surprising suggestion on this  question  of  the  &quot; lotviable &quot; is contained in an Appendix to the Jewish Agency Memor-andum, supplied by  Dr. Joseph Weiz.   He  deals with  the Hill country  and  alleges  that  the  area that can  be cultivated  is ,137,495  dunams.   This  compares with  the  estimate  of  the Director of Surveys of 2,450,000 dunams.  The basic lot should, he suggests, consist of  30 dunams, 10  dunams containing olive and fig-trees, eight containing fruit-trees, seven containing  grape-vines, and  five occupied by  the  farmyard and  vegetable patch.    By arranging in this  manner  he concludes  that  there  would be room for a further 74,000 families in the Hills.  It is difficult to take the proposal  as a serious  contribution to the study of this important subject.  That Dr. Weiz  has his doubts may be concluded  from the last sentence of his note :        &quot; Even if a further reserve of 50  per cent. i6 made, it would follow    that there would be room for the additional settlement of 35,000 families    in the Hill  country during the next thirty years.&quot;    The report  of  the  Committee on  &quot; The Economic  Condition of Agriculturists&quot; records the opinion, at  page  32 of the  report, that : -       &quot;To provide  the minimum cost of living for a family, a holding of     75 dunams seems to be necessary for an owner-cultivator while a tenant     requires  130 dunams.&quot;
This opinion was arrived at on a consideration of the gross return from the holding at the prices of the  years 1924 to 1928.  As hasbeen shown elsewhere, present-day prices are but 50 per cent, ofthose adopted by the Committee in arriving at its deductions.  A detailed  investigation was  made into  the conditions  in the village of Beer  Zeit, in the Hill country, for the purpose  of this enquiry.  Of  the  cultivation  27.4 per  cent,  consisted  of  olivegroves 8.2 per  cent,  of  figs and  other  fruit-trees,  17.8 of  vinesand 46.6 of  cereals.  It  was  found that there were 180  families in  the village, that the &quot; lot  viable &quot; was  112 dunams,  and thatthe village could only provide holdings of that area for 65 families.There were therefore 115 families in excess  of the number whichthe village could  actually support.  The total debt of the villageamounts  to   7,000, an  average of about  39 per  family.   TheThe sources  of maintenance  beside  cultivation were remittancesfrom persons  who had emigrated to America from the village, dailylabour in the village and elsewhere, and  additional borrowing fromthe moneylenders.  And Beer Zeit is regarded as a village abovethe average of Hill villages in prosperity.   It is clear  that in unirrigated land the &quot; lot viable &quot;  is not lessthan 130 dunams in the dry tracts, unless command of considerablecapital enables the tenant to maintain a dairy herd of foreign  orcross-bred animals, in which case in the richer tracts, the  holding may possibly, but questionably, be reduced to 100 dunams.  Where irrigation is  available and where  dairying is possible, the  holding may be  reduced to 40  dunams of which  half irrigable.  Where plantations are established  the  &quot;  lot viable &quot;, at  present prices of Jaffa oranges and bananas, may be placed at 15 to 20 dunams.    Alteration  of the Lot  Viable by means of improved methods of cultivation. The  area necessary  for the maintenance  of  a family depends  of course largely on  the  class of the soil and the kind of culture, and  also and this to a large extent on the level  of culti- vatiom.  It is clear that  in the wind-blown soils of the Maritime Plain, where oranges are planted with success, an area of 15 or 20 dunams  may suffice to support a family, while in the  poor  cereal soils  of  the  unirrigable  plains, and even  more  so of the  Hills, even  an area  of  160 dunams  may  be  insufficient to maintain a decent standard of life.  It must be remembered that an area which will only maintain one  family  with the existing extensive&apos; habit of cultivation by the fellah, may quite  well be made to support a population  half  as large  again  if  there  were  capital  available, methods of cultivation were improved and the cultivator were  able to employ  manure  and good seed.   On the figures as they stand it might  very  well be argued,  and argued  with perfect truth and sincerity, that there is no room for a  single additional  cultivator in Palestine.  Unless  some  steps are taken towards  the develop-  ment of the country that statement is true and unanswerable. There  is no land  for additional settlement without still further reducing  the level of  the fellah&apos;s standard of life. It is, however, quite well  possible to  improve that  standard  of  life  and to make  available  land for further colonisation if the existing land is  developed as  it should be developed.   It is much to be regretted that no steps  have  so far been taken to ensure agricultural progress in rural  Palestine, except  by the Jewish agencies.     Economic position of the fellah. Evidence from every possible  source tends to support the conclusion that the Arab fellah cultiva-  tor is in a desperate position.  He has  no capital for his farm.  He  is, on the contrary, heavily  in debt.  His rent is rising, he has to  pay very heavy taxes,  and the rate of interest on  his loans is in-  credibly high.   On the  other hand,  he  is  intelligent  and hard-  working, and pitifully  anxious to improve his standard of  cultiva-  tion and his standard of life.  And very little has been done  for him  in the  past.     Distribution  of available  area. It  has been shown  that there   are  about  61,408 fellah  families  who cultivate   some   5,644,000   dunams of  land.  This gives an average holding of 91.9 dunams per   family.  It is true, as pointed out in the memorandum of the Jewish   Agency on the  Report of the  Commission on the  Disturbances,   that there  are a  number of Arabs who  cultivate orange groves   and vegetables.   Their number, however,  is not  material to  the
argument and may be set off against the reduction in the area dueto the German  villages and  to  a certain  area of agricultural landheld by  some of the  churches.  The enquiry,  of the &quot; Commission on  the Economic Conditionof Agriculturists &quot;, in 104 villages  resulted  in a  very  differentestimate.  In the cases of  about 16,633 families it was found thatthe average holding  was  75.00 dunams per  family.   It was  alsoestablished that  of 23,573  families resident  in  those villages only,477 farmers live entirely from agriculture.  Of these 3,873 holdover 240 dunams and 1,604  from 120-240 dunams.   Not  a singlefarmer  who  held less  than  120 dunams  was able to live  on  the produce  of his farm  without outside labour,  and of those  holdingfrom  120-240 dunams  1,657  found it necessary to procure labour in addition to their farming, in order to  maintain themselves andtheir  families.   From this  it  is  quite clear that 120 dunams is  nota large  enough  agricultural  lot to support  a  fellah family withcereal cultivation.  This  bears out  the  opinion  of  the  Expertsquoted by the Commission on the Disturbances on p.  121  of theirReport,  to the effect that the  area required for a  holding varies from160 dunams per family in  good soil  suitable  for dairy farming, to320 dunams  in  the less productive soil of the  cereal-growing dis-tricts.  In fact the average fellah holding is insufficient to maintainanything like a decent standard of life.  A careful enquiry has been made in 51 Arab villages in which  the survey  has  been completed,  and in which  therefore exact areasof cultivation are  known,  in the Jaffa,  Ramleh  and Gaza Sub-districts.  In  the Jaffa Sub-district, in 11 villages, the average fellah hold-ing, including in  that  holding the  lands owned  and  the landsleased,  amounts  on an average  to 58 dunams.   It is  in this areathat there are the largest  number of plantations.  In  the Ramleh Sub-districts, in 17 villages,  of  which two only have plantations, the average fellah holding is 90 dunams.  In  the  Gaza  Sub-district, the figures  of  23  villages, of whichagain two only contain plantations, the holding of the fellah aver-ages 80  dunams.  In  all the villages the average fellah holding  is 78.6 dunams.  The requirements and standard of life of the Fellah. The life ofthe fellah is  one of great struggle and  privation.  The Director ofEducation, in the course of a note, makes  the following remarks :       &quot; The economic state of  the agricultural  population  is desperate.    Hardly any Arab village exists  -which is  not in debt.  The fellahin  are    so over-taxed  that they find  great difficulty in  paying the tithe. More-    over, after  an excellent harvest, they are  unable to sell their corn or    barley or oil.   In 15 villages recenty visited by  the writer in Galilee,    the same desperate state  of affairs was evident. Money is so scarce    in some places that  the people purchase the necessities of life by barter,    and they cannot pay the tithe without further borrowing.  This means    increasing  their already overwhelming debt to  the moneylender .....    &apos; We  have been struggling in deep water  for  several years, and very    soon  the water  will close over our heads &apos;  was the statement  made in    one  village, which  may be  taken as typical of  the state of  mind in    every village  ....      &quot; If the  state of the Arab fellah is to be improved, and it is evidently    one of the  most  important problems  which  face the  Administration m    Palestine, his  children must be given an education which will help them    to avoid falling into the situation in which the present generation finds    itself  to-day.&quot;  Dr. Wilkansky writes as follows :     &quot;  ....  The diet of the fellah is poor and  monotonous.  His staple    food  is &apos; pittah,&apos; cake of unleavened  bread which he bakes every  day.    A few pittahs, with onions  or  radishes form his  morning and midday    meals.  A  cooked meal; called  by him &apos; tabiach,&apos;  is  only prepared  for    him in the evening.  It consists of the  herb &apos; hubza&apos; flavoured with    onions and  pepper.  When tomatoes are  in season he eats tomato salad    flavoured with pepper.  Pepper and oil are his two condiments.  Most    of his requirements are provided by his own fields, and he buys  but    little outside ....   The fellah  uses very little meat.  For entertaining    visitors he  will kill a sick sheep, or  some sick fowls.  They also have    meat when  an ox or a camel falls ill beyond recovery.  They then  kill    the animal and treat the members of the village  with a portion of  the    flesh.  Sometimes with tho  money which  the  woman  obtains in  the    market from the sale of fowls,  cheese and  eggs,  she purchases a  pair    of trotters, a  head or so forth;  from which she prepares a special treat    oh returning  home.&quot;
  The FellaWs capital. The fellah may or may not own his landbut he  has no free working  capital.   The  amount invested in  hisfarm  is detailed by Dr.  Wilkansky as follows :             -                ....                        iOxen, or  a camel   ............   15  to  20I ass  ...     ...     ...     ;........     3  to   41 plough.........    .........     0-401 threshing board  ...............     0.602 wooden  picks     ...     ...    ...            ---     0.151 iron pick   .........           -     -     0.207 sacks for straw   ...............     0-601 scythe  (?sickle)   ................     0-101 yoke or pole     ...............     0-p0Ropes for binding   .........     ......     0.302 sieves      ......                               0.25Total     21.20 to  27.20In addition he  may have 20 sheep worth  1  each,  a cow worth 6- 10, a goat worth . 0.80 to  1 and 30  fowls,  3 to  4,  makinga grand total  of  51 to  62.20.  The fellah&apos;s plough. It is a common impression that the fellah&apos;^cultivation is  entirely inadequate, and  a good  deal of ridicule hasbeen  and is poured upon the nail-plough  which he uses.  In thestcny country of the Hills no other plough would be able to do thowork at all.   With regard to the use of that plough, Dr. WUkanskywrites : i    &quot; . . . . The Arab plough is like the ancient Hebrew plough  ....  Its    distinguishing characteristic  is that it cuts the surface soil and does not  -  turn it up.  It performs, very slowly, it is true, but very thoroughly,    all the functions for which a  combination of  modern machines is required     a. plough, a  roller and a  harrow.  Its great virtues are that it does    not bring vip clods, that it does not press or crush the moist earth, but    flits as it were over the ground with its coulter which resembles a duck&apos;s    foot in its base, and that it  penetrates the ground with its point, which.    is sharp and  long like the  head  of a spear.  It  produces the  requisite    loose and broken crust by itself, without the aid of other implements.    The fellah  has only one garment, which he wears both day and night    ....  But the ploughing  of the fellah  is above reproach.  His field,    prepared for  sowing, is never inferior  to  that  prepared by the  most    perfect implements, and sometimes  it even surpasses  all others.  The    defect lies  only in the slowness, which calls for modification  in order to    adapt the  working process  to the rate of speed  in our time.&quot;   The fellah  as  a cultivator. The fellah  is neither  lazy  nor unin-telligent.  He is a competent and capable agriculturist,  and thereis little  doubt  that  were he to  be  given the  chance of learningbetter methods, and  the capital,  which is a necessary preliminary to their employment,  he would rapidly improve his position.   Mean-while, however, the income which he can procure from  his inade-quate farm is insufficient to maintain him in a decent standard oicomfort and leaves no margin whatever for improvements.   The method  on which the average cereal farm of the fellah isworked is that the holding is divided into two areas.  In  one of theareas he  sows his winter crops, while the other  lies fallow.  In thisfallow portion, in the  spring, the  summer  crop  is  sown; in  theformer portion,  after reaping the winter  crops in  May and June,the land lies fallow until the following spring, when the  summercrops are sown.   In the latter  portion,  after  the reaping of  the summer  crop, the winter crop is at once sown.  Tims in each por- tion  two crops,  one summer and  one winter, are  taken in twoyears.   The return from the fellah&apos;s farm. The return from a farm of 120 dunams  is  very small.   The gross income  is estimated at   40. of  which  10  is  payable  as tithe, leaving  30- for  the family expenses of the year.  (Mr.  Smilansky&apos;s  pamphlet :  &quot; The Jewish. Colonisation  and  the Fellah &quot;).  Dr.  Wilkansky has made a de- tailed estimate of the income and expenditure of an ordinary fellah on a holding of 8O7IOO dunams in his  work  on &quot; The  Fellah&apos;s Farm,&quot;  to which reference has already been made.   This estimate and  estimates  contained in  the  report of  the Committee on  the Economic Condition of Agriculturists are included in Appendix 18.
  In connection with Dr. Wilkansky&apos;s estimate it is to be  remarked that nothing is shown as payable for rent, also, that income is shownfrom milk, but nothing on  the expenditure for the  feeding of thecow.  The balance available for personal expenditure of the wholehousehold for a year in 18s.   This sum has to meet all luxuryexpenditure,  including expenditure on the purchase of meat.  Deductions from the figures supplied  by  104 villages. In theenquiry conducted by the Committee on the &quot; Economic Condi.action of  Agriculturists,&quot; returns  were made showing the gross incomedeclared as received from all sources in the 104 villages  in question.This declaration  was  revised  by  the  Committee on  the  basis  of average  prices  of the previous four  years taken in 1028  for .hepurpose of commutation of the Tithe.   In the  Committee&apos;s  estimatealso the  total produce  reported by the villages was revised  to agreewith the average yields per dunam used for the commutation  ofthe Tithe.  The  returns thus  calculated  given  in that  Deport areappended to  this Deport in Appendix  13.  Prices have fallen verymaterially since the commutation of the  Tithe in 1928, and a cal-culaiion  has  been  made of the gross income of the 104  villages,applying the prices prevailing in May, 1930.   The sum reached is 306,043, as compared with the declared return of  301,999, andthe Committee&apos;s  calculation of  483,600.   The yield  accepted bythe Committee has been taken as the  actual yield for the  purposesof the  new calculation.  That  on which the declaration was basedis considerably smaller.  For yields, see Appendix 24.  On the figures  adopted by the Committee the gross average yield of 100 dunams of the field crops only amounts  to  51.   On the revised figures now calculated it is  32.  The above figures refer only to the income from the field crops.From  fruit  trees, stock,  dairy produce,  poultry and other villagesources, and from their transport and  labour  outside  the villagethere was a declared income of  242,882.  This figure was examined in detail by  the  Committee.   They have raised it to  429,070.They have,  however,  continued  to take the prices on which theCommuted Tithe was based rather than existing prices.   For in-stance, they  estimate  the value of olive-oil at  53 a ton, while thepresent  price is  but  33 a  ton.    Making an  adjustment on this account  a figure  of  388,373 may be accepted as the income fromother sources than crops.  Thus the following  result is reached :                                                              Declaration made by the villages as total income    544,881    Income as calculated by the Committee  ...    ...   912,670    Income as now calculated  ...     ...     ...    ...   694,416The gross income per family  works out at  23 Is.,  38 7s. and 29 4s.  on the above  totals, respectively.  Out of this amount hasto be met (a) expenses of production, estimated by  the CommLteeat   22; (b)  Taxes, calculated at  5 ; (c) The maintenance of  thefellah  and his family.  The  household  expenditure  is shown  byDr. Wilkansky to be  49.50.  In none of the cases, therefore, does the total income  cover the essential expenses of the cultivator.   The fellah&apos;s debts. In addition to these facts it must  be borne in mind that the average holding of 104 villages is not  100 dunams,but 75 dunams, and that so far from there being no payment to bemade  for debt,  it is  accepted that  the average debt per familyamounts to   27, on  which  the rate  of interest of 30  per cent, isusual, that is to. say, that  for interest alone the family must pay 8 per annum.   The rate of 30 per cent, is regarded as quite reason-able, and is  indeed exceeded in many cases.  It is a usual practice for the moneylender or the merchant to make an advance  on termsknown as &quot; ashara-hamastash,&quot; which means that a  sum of  10advanced at the  time of  sowing is repaid by a  sum of  15 at  thetime of harvest.   Another  common arrangement is interest at  therate of Is. in the  pound per month.   Legal rate of  interest. In regard  to  this  question of interest, itis true that the legal rate of interest is 9 per cent: per annum.  Thislaw is a dead letter.   There are many obvious methods of evasion, and even were there no such methods, no fellah would dare  to defendhimself by means of this law, as he  would unquestionably close to
800850himself the door of the moneylender for ever.  Without the money-lender he cannot live.  Commutation of the Tithe and the result of the fall in prices.-The position of the Arab cultivator has always been one of extremepoverty, but there are at the present time certain circumstances which render it more desperate than has been the case in the past.In  the year 1928,  steps were  taken  to commute  the Tithe.  Thispayment was based on the  average  yields  and prices of  the fourpreceding  years.   Since  that  time  there  has been  a progressivefall  of  prices  of agricultural  produce.   (Vide Appendix  14.)During the present year the fall has become more rapid and morepronounced. As a result, the  Arab cultivator has now to sell,  not one-tenth,  but one-fifth of his crop in order to  pay the  Tithe in cash.  Indeed, in many  cases the amount is more than  one-fifthfor the prices  for  commutation of the  Tithe were based not  on prices of the village  but  on those of the  market town,  and  thetwo rates  vary largely.   In addition, the price of sale  is  lower than the price  of  purchase, and the  price  of  forced sale is stilllower.  At the time  of this enquiry actual prices of sale were incertain cases extraordinary.  Villages found it exceedingly difficultto sell at all, and there was an estabhshed case  reported in whichbarley  was sold at Gaza  at  2 a  ton,  when the quoted market price was   3.1, itself a price exceedingly low.  Diminution of the  size  of holdings. There is also a progressivediminution in  the areas  of  the holdings; in every village  visitedthere were complaints on this score.  Portions of the holdings weresold either to pay off debts or to pay  the  Government taxes or toobtain the wherewithal to keep the family alive.  The population of the villages is increasing faster than in Turkishtimes,  owing in  large measure to  the  cessation of conscription.There is consequently increasing competition for land, and divisionof holdings among the increased number of members of the family.  Rise in  rents. Rents  are rising; those who  wish  to rent landfind it difficult to obtain it, and offer rents which frequently cannotbe  paid and yet leave a surplus for the maintenance of the familyin a standard of reasonable comfort.   Cases were reported  in whichfellahin who desired to  obtain land offered 50  per  cent,  of  the produce, the landlord paying  the Tithe.  The Committee reportsthat the commonest rent is 30 per cent,  of the produce, the tenantpaying the Tithe, or  40 percent., the Tithe falling on the  landlord.Money rents are now beginning to  appear in some  parts of thecountry, as was to be expected as a consequence of the commutationof the Tithe.  These  rents vary from about 50 mils to 250 mils thedunam.  The  most  common  is 100-150  mils  (i.e.,  2s.   to  3s.).Above  it has been reported that the gross income of 100 dunamsof  field crops is  32 at present prices.  At 3s.  a dunam the rentwould be  15 for 100 dunams, that  is, equal to  about 47 per cent.of  the gross income.  One case reported has  reference  to landowned, but not yet settled,  by Jews, of which Arab tenants in anadjoining  village rent 5,600 dunams.  Up to the year 1926-27 thecultivators paid 20 per cent, of the  produce in kind.   Since then,the lease  has been put  up to public auction and in  1927-28 pro-duced   260, in 1928-29   400, and  in  1929-30   525.   It is  not suggested  that the rent is even now  excessive, but the rise of morethan 100 per cent, in the past  three years demonstrates the amountof competition that exists for land.   Financial situation of  the Fellah. As to the financial  situation of  the  Arab Farmer  the  Committee  on the Economic Condition ofAgriculturists  write :      &quot; .... Up till the middle  of 1929, the net income of the average agri-    cultural family has been between  25 and  30,  and the  family  has    contrived to live on this income. It is clear, however, that there must    have been many families less favourably situated, who have been  obliged    either to lower  their standard of living or to fall into debt  . .  . many    farmers now owe sums that are quite beyond their capacity to pay . .  . .&quot; t another place they write :     &quot; . . .  . We think  that it may safely be assumed  that, with very rare    exceptions, every village can provide  its own subsistence even if  the    standard of  living may  fall slightly below the figure we have  estimated.    The farmer  is often-perhaps  habitually-short of ready cash, but there    is no evidence that he or  his family  are ever without sufficient  food    for their subsistence . . . .&quot;
  It should be remarked that between the middle of 1929, to whichperiod the Committee refer in discussing the net income of any agricultural  family,  and the  month  of July, 1930, the  price ofagricultural  produce fell heavily.  In  the graph appended to thisreport (No.  I) it is seen that  the price of wheat fell  in the twelvemonths in question  from  11 to  6  per ton, that of barley from 5  to  &apos;6, and that of durrah from  ti  to  4.  The net income ofthe family&apos; cannot therefore now be regarded as  24 or  30.  Ithas reached vanishing  point.   The  calculation  of the Committeeshowing that the net return of 100 dunams to the owner-cultivatoris  35.2 and to the tenant  20, has been revised on the basis of theprices of July 1930.  The calculation is contained in Appendix 15 tothis report.  The result shows a net return of  11.800 mils in thecase of the owner-cultivator and  3.000 mils to  the tenant.   Warrants and imprisonment for debt. A further sympton of theeconomic  position of the  Arab cultivator is found in the numberof  cases  in \which  it  is necessary  to  issue warrants for  debt.Attempts  were made to collect information on this point, but it hasbeen  tound difficult to concentrate  figures.  The  Supreme Courtgave  information  with respect to warrants issued for debt in alldistricts during the first two months of the present year, except inthe district of Jaffa, for which the figures were not available, andthe actual imprisonment figures for Haifa, which were not reported.The statement is therefore not complete, but  even so it shows thatin the two months in the area inciuued in the return 2,(577 warrantswere issued for debt and 599  persons imprisoned.  A report on this point was received from the Director of Agri-culture in respect of the Haifa district for the  past year.  Fromthis it appears that in the Magistrates&apos; Court at Haifa alone andfor the Sub-district of Haifa, with a population estimated at 67,800,there were  heard  8,701 proceedings for  debt, issued 4,872 ordersfor execution and riled 2,756 applications for  imprisonment fordebt.  Assuming that the average family consists of 5 persons, thetotal  number of  families in  the Sub-district  was  13,560.   Theexecution proceedings  taken  were thus  in number  equal  to 64.2 per cent,  of the  number of families of the Sub-district.  Accordingto the census of 1922 the Jewish  population  represented less  than20  per cent, of  the population of this  Sub-district.  The taxes paid by agriculturists are :        (1) The Tithe.       (2) The Werko.       (3) The Animal Tax.  In addition the agriculturist pays  indirect  taxes upon imported goods which he purchases, and fees on registration when land istransferred.   Tithe. 1. The Commuted Tithe  has now replaced the  tithe,except  in the case of a small number  of Bedu tribal areas in theBeersheba Sub-district, where the Tithe at the rate of 10 per cent.of the produce of  the land is still collected in  money.  As has beennoted above, the commutation of the Tithe was carried  through  in1928.   In Appendix 14 of this report the market prices of the chiefcrops during the four years of which the prices  formed the basis ofcommutation, the rate adopted for conversion and the market rateof July, 1930, are shown.   House  and Land  Tax. 2. The Werko is the house and landtax,  authorised  by the Ottoman Law  of  5th August, 1886.   It is assessed on capital value, and  at  various  rates which  are shownin  Appendix  16.   The rate  on lands  subject  to Tithe,  and on ordinary  farm  buildings  is 4 per mille.  An addition to this taxaggregating 41 per cent, on buildings and 56 per cent, on lands waslevied from time to time  by Ottoman Decree, and is still collected,-except in the case of buildings and lands re-assessed  since 1919.   The  Animal Ta.-r.-The Animal Tax is imposed per capita ohce-annually  at the following rates : Sheep and goats  ...Camels  and buffaloes 48 mils.120 mils. 90 mils.
Camels and buffaloes used solely for ploughing are exempt  fromthe tax.  Double taxes are charged on all animals not declared bythe owners at the time of enumeration.   Recovery  of taxes. The following note  was  prepared  by theDistrict Officer  of Jaffa on  the question  of the  taxation of thefellah.    &quot; . . . .  The  information given .... at Lydda,  that sometimes  a    man&apos;s whole crop is attached for taxes is correct.  The  further  state-    nient, however, that he is prevented from selling a  part  of it  in order    to redeem the rest  needs qualification ....   The crop  of the villager    is the only thing that a revenue officer can find if  he wants to attach    for taxes.  This crop can be got hold  of only before threshing. .  . .  The    only way to. do this is to place a guard during the time that threshing    is going  on.  This guard fully gives the impression that no crop may be    disposed of before the tax is paid.  He is, of course, kept at the expense    of the defaulters, and his wages are an additional burden.  Rather than    pay theso wages the defaulters often incur debt in order to pay off the    tax and get rid of the  guard.  The impression therefore remains that    attachment could not be removed until the whole tax is paid.  In fact    the villager finds a great deal of difficulty  in threshing, and then selling    just a part of his crop while attachment is going  on at his  expense.    To deal  with a small crop in bits is not easy,  nor is the disposal of  it    in small quantities easy. It means a special journey to town, where he    may have to spend  a day or two  before he can sell and  get his    money ....  In many cases, the only way out of it lias been  to incur    debt ....   In conclusion, I feel it is my duty to mention  a frank    opinion  in  regard to the collection of taxes  in  the villages ....  I    believe that at least 50  per cent, of the rural population, on account of    their very small  incomes, which do not exceed  30 per annum per family    of six persons, ought to be relieved from all taxation.  To such persons    the price of crops is immaterial, as they have practically nothing surplu3    to sell.....The villagers .... have in these cases paid, by allowing    themselves to suffer privations or by incurring  debt .... I am ....    thoroughly convinced that if these villagers were to refuse payment and    say &apos; we are sorry, but we would pay if we only could &apos;, we should find    ourselves totally unable  to collect the  taxes by  legal  methods.  This is a    point which deserves the serious consideration of  Government ....  T    submit therefore that it is essential  that a minimum be exempt from    taxes with as little  delay as possible.   The amount which these  villagers    pay is not great, but in proportion to their income it is excessive.&quot;   The  above has  been quoted at some length, as  it  is typical  ofthe complaints and proposals made in every  quarter.    The  hold-ing of the fellah is so small, and his  out-turn so exiguous that theagricultural tax  falls on him with  special   force.    And  this  isaggravated by the present fall in prices.    Everywhere this  year the small cultivator has  had to borrow in order to pay  his taxes,when he has paid them.   In very  many cases  he  has found itimpossible  to pay them at all.   The  arrears of agricultural faxesare very heavy.    In Appendix 17 a statement of these  arrearsis shown.    It gives  a total of  238,000.   Taxation: Remedial measures. Of the seriousness of this ques-tion of  agricultural taxation  evidence is afforded  in the  Reportof the  Committee on  the Economic  Condition of Agriculturists.The  Committee found that  the Tithe and  Animal Tax togetheramounted to 19 per cent, of the net  return  from the  use of land.The net return was reached by deducting from the assumed grossreturn  the  cost  of production and the rent.    But in arriving  atthe figure of net  return they used  prices  of the Tithe  commuta-tion which  are admittedly double those of the market to-day.   the incidence of taxation  would  therefore be much higher if  to-day&apos;sprices were applied.    In fact,  the  Tithe,  in place of being 10per cent, of gross income, as it was  at the time  of  commutation,is to-day actually  20  per cent, of the  gross income.   Government action  to  relieve the burden  of taxation. Thewhole question of taxation is at present  engaging the attention  ofthe Palestine Government.   At the moment the burden of taxa-tion is not  adjusted  to  the various  classes of the community inaccordance  with their ability  to pay.    It is intended to  replace the Tithe and the  Werko by a  land tax fixed in accordance  withthe quality  of the land.   The settlement is being carried out withthis intention.    Until  it  is possible to impose  such a  tax,  theTithe  should  be  entirely remitted,  if feasible.    If  it is foundfinancially  impossible to grant  this  measure of relief, the Titheshould  be reduced to a  sum  whose  payment is possible  by  the
ordinary cultivator without the necessity of recourse to the money-lender.   As  a temporary  measure it might  be possible  to vary the  Tithe  in  accordance with the variation of  the market pricesof agricultural  produce.    As  at  the present  time  these pricesstand  at about half of the  prices at the time  the Tithe was com-muted, the relief  so afforded  would amount to about 50 per cent.                   THE BEDDIN POPULATION.  One of the  problems of land administration in Palestine lies  inthe  indefinite  rights of the  Beduin  population.    The problem was  discussed  by Mr.  Snell  in  his Note of  Reservations  at pp.177 and 178 of the Report of the Commission on the Disturbances.His  examination  does  not lead to any  definite recommendation and  it is  indeed  exceedingly difficult to  arrive  at  any  definite conclusion  on the subject  of  the treatment  of the Beduin.  Of these nomads there were estimated to be 103,331 at the timeof the census of 1922,  but it is generally agreed that  this figure is inaccurate.   The majority of these Beduin wander over thecountry in the Beersheba  area  and the region  south and east  ofit, but they  are  found in considerable  numbers in  the  jordan valley  and in smaller numbers in the four other plains.   their rights  have never  been  determined.    They claim rights of cul-tivation and grazing, of an indefinite character and over indefiniteareas.    Mr.  Snell recorded  that  they have  established a tradi-tional  right to  graze their cattle  on  the fellah&apos;s land after the harvest.    In the  region which they regard  as their  own, theydivide  the country among  their various tribes, and  in the tractrecognised  as the  sphere  of  a tribe, the  Shiekhs or  the  TribalElders, divide  the  individual plots  among  the families  of the tribe.  The position is  unsatisfactory.   If, for instance, artesian waterwere discovered in the Beersheba area, there is little  doubt thatclaims would immediately  be urged,  by  the  tribes of  the Beer-sheba tract, to the land commanded by that water.  If the close settlement of that area  were to be attempted, even with the goodwill of the Beduin, it would be  difficult  in view  ofthe indeterminate nature of their rights.  Were they hostile, closesettlement would  be imposible save at the expense  of extensiveand  efficient measures for the protection of the new settlers. Thesame is to a lesser extent the case in  the Jordan Valley.   If thedevelopment  of irrigable  areas  is  undertaken in  that  region,measures must  be taken to ensure settlers against hostile raids..  The Beduin  are  an attractive and a picturesque element in the life of the country, but they are an  anachronism wherever closedevelopment is  possible  and is desired.    At the same time their existence cannot  be overlooked.   In  any solution  of  the Pales-tine problem,  they are an element  which  must  be recognised.Also in  any plans of development it will be  necessary carefullyto consider, and scrupulously  to record and deal with their rights.  Complaints are made by these people in  respect of The Jewishsettlement both in the  Vale of Esdraelon  and in  the MaritimePlain.   A deputation of the Sheikhs of the Beersheba Sub-districtstated that they had been in the habit of taking their stock upto the North  of Palestine during the  sommer months when thereis no grazing in the South, and that  it had been their invariablecustom to  graze  their  flocks and herds  on  the stubbles afterthe harvest had been carried.   This  allegation is generally char-acterized  as baseless,  but in the report on  the Department  ofHealth for the  year 1929, it  is recorded that  Beduin Tribes fromthe  Beersheba  District  were  &quot; heavily  infected &quot; with malaria,&quot; during  their  migrations  up the  Jordan Valley.&quot;    It  is alsoknown that they  bring their  flocks  of camels up  to the tractnorth  of Jericho during the calving season.   It is  also true thata few  years ago when  there  was serious draught  in the South  ofPalestine,  very large numbers of animals belonging to the Beduinwere  transported  to the  North  of  Palestine,  where  they were allowed to graze.  At the time of inspection of the Wadi HawaretK lands a largenumber of Beduin tents were found in  that area.   It was stated
that their migration  to  this region is a  new  departure and isconnected with  the attempt to defeat  the efforts of the Jews tocolonize that tract.  This information comes from Jewish sources.From Arab  sources is was alleged that the migration was annual,in connection with the summer grazing.  Their rights in the Jordan Valley will  require careful enquirybefore any  scheme of development and settlement  is undertaken in that area.   If rights are established, and the tract over whichthey extend is necessary  to the scheme, the Beduin  must be com-pensated for the loss of those rights.   The future  of the Beduinis a question bristling with difficulties and  by  no means free fromanxiety.   It must be faced and a definite  policy adopted.  Other-wise  there  is always  the danger  that  an outbreak may  occurover some trivial and  casual circumstance.   It  is impossible toanchor these people in houses or in villages.   It may be that theonly possible policy  will  be to create  for  them  a reserve, whichwill be apart and excluded from  the area  designated for develop-ment.                        CHAPTER VII.                   Agricultural Development.                    A.  EXISTING AGENCIES.         Jewish Agencies for agricultural development.  The Experimental Station. One of the important and progres-sive branches of Jewish activity in Palestine is the scientific develop-ment of agriculture.  The Experimental  Station of Tel-Aviv, with,its extension farms in various settlements in the country, is not onlyengaged in research work of the highest value to Palestinian agricul-ture in general, but it is also the  centre of agricultural instructionfor the Jewish settlements.  The  Institution  was founded in 1922,and since that year some  85,500 has been spent on its equipment and maintenance.  It  is staffed by  40 scientists, has three laboratory-tory   divisions  (Plant  Pathology,   Entomology,   AgriculturalChemistry) and seven field divisions  (Agronomy, Plant breeding and variety  testing,  Horticulture,  Horticultural  breeding,  FarmManagement  and  Rural Economics,  Dairy  husbandry  and  theExtension  Division).  The Extension Division. The Extension Division is of great im-portance  for   practical   agriculturists.  It   not  only maintainsdemonstration fields, but also nine district instructors under a chief-of division.  The services of these instructors are available for anyof the settlers who desire to refer to them.  In the division of dairyhusbandry the Institution is carrying out experiments in conjunctionwith the Empire Marketing Board on the questions of the uniforma-tion of the herd,  of the substitution of other feeding stuffs for milkin  the rearing of calves  and of the  proper feeding  rations  for cowaand calves.  The Hebrew University. In addition  to  the Agricultural Ex-perimental /Station of Tel-Aviv with  its extension  farms, agricultural work of a  scientific character is also done  by  qualified  researchchemists and  analysts at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.      Department of Agriculture of the Palestine Government.  The third agency for Agricultural Development is the Department&apos;of Agriculture of  the Palestine Government.  This Department  has done outstanding work in two practical directions in locust cam-paigns and  in veterinary service, which has succeeded in stampingout the cattle plague.   In both of these directions the work  hasbeen  of untold value to  the country.   The Department has a very,limited budget, and a  criticism may be allowed that it has not  thomoney requisite  for practical demonstration  work, work  which isof particular importance in a country  where agricultural practice iseminently backward.
  The Agricultural Department is a composite  Department, com-prising the following services : Agriculture, Forestry, Veterinary,Horticultural, Entomological, Irrigation, Fisheries,  Stock-breeding,Analytical,  Sericultural,  Meteorological.    It   also  controls  theKadoorie agricultural schools, which were founded  with funds left for the purpose by a generous and wealthy Jew.  Expenditure.-The   expenditure  of   the   Department   was 76,713 in 1929, and the estimate for 1930,  77,054.  Relations  with  Jewish  agencies for agricultural  development. There is a danger that the Government services will overlap the ser-vices supported by Jewish  agencies and  the Hebrew  University.This danger was early  recognised by the Director of Agriculture,who wrote in 1921 :     &quot; . . . . The  need for elasticity was pointed by a comprehensive pro-    gramme of agricultural  research  drafted by the Zionist  Commission    early in 1920.  This undertaking promised to limit our financial  respon-    sfoility  if correlation  of  effort could be secured.  It  was  consequently    agreed  at a Conference held in June 1920 that certain clearly  defined    branches of investigation should be left  to the Commission^ technical    advisers .... It was  nevertheless decided that as Zionist co-operation    was assured at no distant  date, certain emergency  services should be    created to meet existing  needs, irrespective of final plans for an organ-    isation entailing considerable capital expenditure and a permanent staff.&quot;  Insufficiency  of  Budget  Allotments. At  the  moment,  theGovernment services are hampered for want of money, and some ofthem are so poorly equipped with funds that it seems questionable whether their continuance is desirable.  In the case of the FisheriesiService, for instance, and  the Sericultural Service the major portionof the funds are spent in salaries.   The former service costs  1,589in personal emoluments, and the balance of expenditure is  300 forthe  maintenance of a launch  and   400 for investigations.   Thegrant-in-aid for sericulture is  450, of which  300 is the salary ofthe  expert.   Similarly, in the stock-breeding service,  salaries ac-count for  3,651,  while other expenditure amounts  to  2,060,namely :     Purchase of stock     ...    ...     ...     ...     ...     600  Budget. In the estimates for 1930 the total budget for agricul-ture and  forests is  77,054.  Of this the  total of personal emolu-ments is  45,009, leaving  32,045 for other expenditure.  Development  activities. From the point of view of the agricul-Agriculturists, the chief activities  of the Agricultural Department,  apartfrom  the  locust campaign and the eradication of the cattle plague,which have already been mentioned,  consist in the maintenance ofthe Agricultural Experimental Stations at Acre and Beisan, and the horticultural Experimental  Stations at  Jerusalem and Jericho. TheBeisan station  is  not  fully utilised,-, owing  to stringency in thebudget.   The Acre Station is  an  excellently organised institutionand is reported  to be visited by many  interested cultivators.  the horticultural Stations  both at Jerusalem  and Jericho serve  usefulpurposes, but in  the case  of the  latter financial resources do not permit of full development.  The  Department  maintains  a staff ofperipatetic instructors.  It  also issues  many leaflets.  The stock-breeding service. Its stock-breeding service  provides a number of pure-bred  South Devon bulls for crossing purposes, andhas now  several bulls  of  the first cross.  Some of these are verypopular animals with the fellah cultivators.   At the Acre station anumber of pure-bred Arab  stallions were  imported in the hope of improving the local  breed  of horses.    An outbreak of dourine puta stop to  these operations.   It is questionable whether the decisionto  import expensive  stallions  was  wise.  Where  funds  are  sorestricted the interests which should be preferred are those  of themost needy, in  the case of Palestine  the ordinary  fellah cultivator,not the larger man, who can keep horses of the pure-bred Arab type.  Poultry husbandry. One of the most highly successful branchesof development throughout  Palestine is in poultry husbandry.  Inall  the Jewish villages large flocks of high-grade poultry  are kept,chiefly White Leghorns and Rhode Island  Reds.  The poultry farmForage  ...Stock-breeding service     3601,100
attached to the Acre Station of the Department of Agriculture is an outstanding instance of success.  It is reported that this farm paysits way and affords a profit to the Department.  It is of very great value to the villagers of the neighbourhood.   Settings  of eggs are sold  at a reasonable figure, and each year hundreds of cockerels aredistributed.   The favourite birds  are  the  White Leghorn and theWhite Sussex,  both of which are easily acclimatised.   It may appear that the introduction of an improved breed  of poultry is asmall matter.  In the case of the fellah, however, every  piastre is ofmoment, and the effect of widespread introduction of an improvedbreed of poultry is of real importance.  The importance of the  demonstration  plot. There  are certaindirections in which the Department of Agriculture  can be of very special use to the ordinary cultivator.   The most important servicethat can be  rendered is education by means of the demonstrationplot, where  the  advantages of  improved  agricultural methods are brought home to him.  It appears that a system of demonstrationplots was at one time initiated by  the Department, but that it wasnot  successful.   The reasons of failure should  be considered,  forplots of this kind have proved exceedingly useful elsewhere.  In a country  of  small-holdings they  are  indeed  the chief means of bringing the results of improved practice to the  notice of the smallcultivator.   It is a mistake to believe that knowledge  filters downin such  countries  from the estate of the large  proprietor. Thecontrary is the case.   The diffusion of practical knowledge of agri-culture among small  men  can best come through demonstration on.holdings of the  character which  they themselves  cultivate.   Scientific  services. The scientific  side of  agriculture  is,  otcourse, of  immense importance.    In  Palestine,  fortunately,  itshould be possible to obtain all that is required on that side by theuse  of  existing  institutions, and  so  to  avoid duplication.  Thereare  competent chemists at the Experimental Station  at  Tel-Avivand at the  Hebrew University  of Jerusalem who are capable  ofany scientific enquiry that may be necessary for the country.   Itcannot be  questioned  that if the Government  were  prepared  tooffer to  pay for work done or to  furnish a grant-in-aid, these in-institutions would readily undertake any work  that the Governmentmay require.  Palestine is such a small country that it is particu-larly inadvisable that institutions of a scientific character shouldoverlap.  Especially is this the case where money is not plentiful.The whole question  deserves serious  consideration, with a view tousing the available  funds to the  best  advantage, if necessary by reducing the number of  services  to those which do not  duplicate services  obtainable  elsewhere,  and  by  abolishing   services  fort which  adequate funds cannot be  provided.   The  distribution of trees. The Department of Agriculture  has ceased to sell  young trees from  its nurseries to the  cultivators. The reason  given  is that  it is undesirable to  compete  with private enterprise.   Private nurseries are almost entirely Jewish,  though there is  one well-known  German nursery.   The decision of  the Department in this  matter was criticised on many occasions, and the interference in private enterprise is in fact  very small, as the fellahin would  neither be willing, or in most cases be  able, to  pay the price  asked by  the  nurseries for any trees.   The importance of trees from the  national, as well as from the individual point of view is so  important that it is desirable to encourage planting by every possible  means.  So far from  refusing the  sale  of seedlings in order to prevent competition with  private enterprise the Depart- ment would be well advised  to  sell  these seedlings at a  nominal price or even give them away, if by so doing the  area under trees could be increased.   The Forest service. At present the Forest service it attached to the Department of Agriculture.   This seems to be a  mistake.  It is  undesirable  to  burden the  Department  of  Agriculture with. matters other than agriculture specially in view of the importance of agricultural development at the present time and the necessity of its extension.  The Forest service is developing rapidly.   There are now 704,000  dunams of  forest reserve,  and  newly afforested areas are showing good promise.
800857  Jewish plantations. The great possibilities of afforestation havebeen  established by Jewish  activities in this matter.  There is asmall Jewish village called  Motza,  close  to  Jerusalem, where afarmer  of  the  name of Broza has planted an orchard, on  whatseemed to be sterile and barren rock.   The trees and the vines haveflourished, and  what was a wilderness without vegetation of any kind  is  now a  fine orchard  producing  a large  income  for itsproprietor.   The  result  is  the  more  praiseworthy in  that theplanter received no assistance from  any Jewish  or other sources,but created the property by his  own  exertions.  Another instanceof development on the same  lines is the  orchard planted by the zionist  Organisation  at Dilb (Kiryath  Anavin).  The  land onwhich that orchard has been planted was  similar  to that of Motza.The trees were  not irrigated but they have succeeded wonderfully.A similar  instance is to  be  found in the  Jewish  suburb of Beth-Hakarem, close to Jerusalem, where a hillside which  appeared tobe hopelessly bare and  arid is now covered with gardens containingtrees  of every kind.  Everywhere the Jews are planting, and haveplanted  trees,  and there  is no  one  of their  colonies  where this branch of agricultural  activity is not in  evidence.                         B. EDUCATION.  The Jewish schools. The first essential to  any scheme of agri-cultural  development in Palestine lies in  primary education.   TheJewish  population  is  magnificently  provided with  educationalfacilities  and  nearly   100  per  cent,  of   Jewish   children  attendJewish schools.  These are maintained by the Jewish authorities with  the aid of a  small grant from  the  Government,  and it is amatter of common complaint in Jewish  circles that this grant is limited to .- &quot;20,000.  It is based on the proportion of Jews to Arabsin the population of the country.   The total expenditure on schoolsmaintained by  or affiliated  with the Department  of Education ofthe Palestine Zionist Executive for the year 1928-29 was  162,500.227 schools were maintained,  with 19,449  pupils.   The State schools. The education of the Arabs  provides a very different  picture.   In  the year 1928-29, the number of elementary schools was 308, of which 259 were in the villages.   Of the schools in the towns 29 were girls&apos; schools and in the villages 8.  The total number of schools  had  decreased by four during  the year.  Thenumber  of  pupils in  the  schools was 25,219.   Of these 12,539, including 573  girls,   attended  village schools.   The   rural  Arab population,  excluding  tribal populations, at mid 1930, was 478,390.It is impossible to determine with accuracy the numbers of children of school-going age which are included in that figure.   At the last census of the whole population, 37.1 per  cent, were under 15  years of age.   It is therefore safe to assume  that at least 20 per cent, of the Arab population of  the  villages  consists of  children of  school age.  This would give over 95,000.   Of these, as  noted above, only 12,539 are taught, or 13.2 per cent.   The reason  for this  small number does not lie  in any reluctance of the Arab to send  his children to school.   On the  contrary, in every village complaints are  made on the score  of the inadequacy of educational  facilities.  Everywhere  a  demand for instruction is found, and  that not only on behalf  of the boys,  but  on behalf of the  girls also.  Ear  more  applications for admission to existing schools are made than can possibly be accepted.   The  Budget. No   agricultural development is  possible  among the  Arabs until  steps are  taken to remedy  the present state of affairs.   The educational budget for the  year 1929 was  144,119, more than   18,000 below  the  budget of the Jewish  organisation for  the same  year for the  same  purpose.  Of this sum  139,789 were spent, and there was a  saving of   4,330 a most unfortunate economy.  It is clear  that an expenditure very much more import- ant  than  140,000 is  necessary if the Araks  are  to be given a fair chance to improve their standard of life.   The necessity. The following is extracted from a note furnished by the Director of Education :       &quot; .... With a  rapidly  increasing population, and a growing  desire     for more education,  expansion in size and in  the  number of schools is     not only  desirable, but, in  the interests of  the people, absolutely neces-     sary.  The demand, however,  has not been met, and the Arab population,&apos;
    not unnaturally, fool resentment against Government,  the revenue of    which is largely contributed by  them,  for not giving them  what they    desire, abovo all else, whereas tho Jewish Agency, with the help of other    organisations, has been  able to provide almost universal education for    Jewish children.  The Arabs see  in every Jewish colony  a well-equipped    school with a trained teacher,  providing accommodation  for every child.    of  school age.  They realise  that without education they are precluded    from social  and economic progress .... Every year a  larger number    of  boys and girls are refused admission to urban schools owing to lack    of  accommodation.  In the rural schools, which at present are mainly    confined to boys, more classes are needed and at least 250 villages, each    containing a population of 300 or more, are not yet provided with  any    school.   The demand  for female education  in  towns is little less iu-    sietent than that for boys, and is increasing in the rural districts.&quot;  Its  importance  to agricultural development. Until facilities for ordinary primary education  are  more  general than is the  case atpresent  the  fellahin will not be in a  position to benefit  generallyby  any special agricultural education that may be afforded.   On thesubject  of agricultural education the  Director of Agriculture has submitted  a note, from which  the following is extracted :     &quot; . . . . Obstacles  to progress  in the  agricultural education of  tho    Arab cultivator  are,  in order of  importance, insolvency,  illiteracy,  and    absence of  instructors of local  origin with  the  necessary  qualifica-    tions . . . .&quot;     &quot; The  futility of urging on  a bankrupt industry improved  practice    involving considerable capital outlay is at last being generally admitted.    It  is to be reported in an authoritative statement within tho next  few    days that from  a gross averago  income of  25 per annum the typical    fellah is required to support  a  family of six,  and contribute  8 as    interest .... on  unproductive   loans .... any  hope  for  marked    development  of agricultural practice lies with the rising  generation now    being educated in recently established village schools.&quot;     &quot; The  agricultural school at  Tulkarem ....  represents  the  first    institution of its character in Palestine  available to the Arabic speaking    population .  ... It is recognised,  however, that the impression which    could be ensured by the education of some 40 residential  students would    be  quite inadequate to the demands of the situation.  It  is consequently-    proposed to afford all village schoolmasters in rotation a special course    of  12 months&apos; duration at the school,  for the  purpose  of ensuring  an    agricultural bias to  primary education  in the villages.&quot;  Agricultural  schools. The school to which Colonel Sawer refersin  the above extract owep its existence to a bequest  by a wealthyJew.  It  provides  accommodation  for 40  boarders.  This  is  a useful commencement, but it should be pointed out that the Arabagricultural  population  forms more than nine-tenths of  the  ruralpopulation of Palestine, and  that this is the only agricultural schoolon  which  they must depend  for  their  agricultural education.   TheJews  already have an  agricultural school  at Mikveh-Israel withaccommodation for 160  students.   They also have  a school  pro-vided  by the Kadoorie bequest and they have several agriculturaltraining schools  for  girls, and a  children&apos;s village where orphanchildren are taught agriculture.  If the Arab population is to haveopportunities of agricultural  development on the same scale as theJew,  a  score of large agricultural  schools must be provided.   The village school and  agriculture. The Department of Educa-tion has already introduced  a  system  intended  to encourage more modern methods  in  agriculture.   It has attached to  many of the village  schools agricultural  plots  where practical work  is  done.It  also teaches sericulture, fruit-farming, and bee-keeping.  At thepresent time this movement is hampered  by the ignorance of the village teacher in agricultural matters  and the whole  of this branchof  village education is dependent on  a single  supervisor, himselfonly partly trained.   Need for additional expenditure. It is  clear that the Govern-ment  of Palestine must face very considerably  increased  expendi-ture  on education,  both primary  and agricultural.  As to  theformer, a plan should be worked out  for expansion over  a term ofyears.  If the educational budget, at present standing at  150,000,were  to be  increased by  15,000 a year for the next ten  years, atthe close  of that  period important progress would have been made towards the solution of the problem of primary education.    This for the Arabs.  At the same  time it is clearly unjust thatthe Jewish authorities should be compelled to provide the  wholeof the  education for their  own  children  practically  at their own expense,  as they are doing at  present.   It  is  true  that  they de-nmnd educational facilities  outside  the present financial  capacity
of the State, but at the same  time, they have the right to expect that the Government  will provide for their children on the sames cale as for the children of the  Arabs.   It seems therefore desirablethat the grant-in-aid to Jewish education should be increased pro-disproportionately with the  increase in the general  education budget ofthe State.   Assuming that the Jewish children of school age bear the same proportion to the total population as is the case with thoArabs, the grant-in-aid from the present year should  be raised to 25,000  and increased by  1,500  per annum (one-tenth  of theproposed increase in the total budget) for the  next ten years.  Technical education in  agriculture. For  technical education inagriculture also a plan should be prepared  to cover the next tenyears.   Its first object should  be to provide accommodation for alargely  increased number  of students  at Tulkarem.   There is  noreason why that school should  not provide education for 120 to 150boys.  The  present grant-in-aid  is  1000  a  year.   It  would  benecessary to increase the grant by at least  1,500 for the increased number  of students.  But the  plan  should  not be confined to  anincrease  in the accommodation  at Tulkarem.   It will  prove  essen-tial to institute similar schools elsewhere, though possibly  not  onthe  same elaborate  scale. The matter is one for very  careful examination  by the Government.  Agricultural certificated  scliool-masters. Meanwhile it should bemade a  condition  of  employment  of  schoolmasters in the  ruralschools  that they should be in  possession of a certificate from theTulkarem school, or from some other recognised agricultural school,that they have attended  a course  in  practical agriculture  for atleast  six months.   One year  seems to be  an  unnecessarily long period for  that purpose.   It  would be an  advantage  if arrange-ments could  be made for  training of these  teachers at one  of theJewish  schools as well as  at Tulkarem, for  it  would be regrettablethat the water-tight system should be observed, even in agriculturalinstruction.  In  the case  of existing schoolmasters, the  Educational Depart-ment will have to  make  the best arrangements possible to releasethem in batches for this  training.  Collaboration between  Departments of Agriculture and  Educa-tion. It is of  course  essential that the Department of Agricultureand the Department of  Education should collaborate closely  inorder to ensure the success of the arrangements proposed for agri-cultural education  in  rural primary schools.    There should be nodifficulty in such collaboration.   The curriculum of the rural  school,in  so far as it includes agricultural instruction, should  be  worked out by  the two Departments in  consultation as also the  curriculumfor the six months&apos; training period of the village schoolmaster.                          C.  IRRIGATION.   The  existing  waste of water. A  most  important condition ofagricultural  development  is water  for irrigation.  On Map No.  5will be found indicated the more important  sources of water supply at  present  known to exist  in the country.   As  a general ruleirrigation water is w-asted in  the  country.   This is very  obviousin  the  irrigated areas of  the Jordan Valley,  the Beisan area,  the Wadi-Fara&apos;a and  the Jericho  area.   In each of these areas it  is probable that  scientific management  of the  irrigation would save enough water  to double the irrigable area from the existing supply..   The Aujha  Concession. It  is regrettable that one of the chief sources of  irrigation in  the  country, the  Aujha River, has been included in  a  concession.  The wisdom of granting such a  conces- eion, which not only removes the control of  irrigation  water from the Government,  but concedes  it to an authority without property in the land to be irrigated,  seems very questionable.   The Aujha concession,  originally given  with the object  of the production  of electric power, and subsequently as  a purely irrigation concession when  it was discovered that  the  current was not required for power,  has  as yet not  been employed for  irrigation  on a modern scale.  A comparatively small portion of water is pumped by riverain proprietors  for the  irrigation of their  orange groves, but  the
great mass  of the water flows into the sea.   A further drawbackto the exercise of the Aujha concession by the concessionnaires isfound  in the fact that if its water were to be used for irrigationof the plantations of the Maritime Plain, the existing demand forelectric power to pump irrigation water from wells in the planta-tions would be liable to diminution or possibly to cessation.   the concession for this power was in the same hands as that for the jordan River, but in 1929 the Palestine Electric Corporation pro-promoted a separate irrigation Company to take over its irrigationrights in  the  Aujha  Concession.   This transfer was approved bythe  Government  on condition that an  irrigation scheme should besubmitted to the Government within a year and that the work mustbe done on the scheme within a period  of two years of its approval,a condition which  was  accepted by the Company.  In the latter portion of 1929, the Corporation submitted an irri-gation scheme for the  lands of Petach Tikvah.  This  scheme  was sent for the examination of the Government technical advisers.  Itis believed that  no report on the scheme has yet been rendered inconsequence of  the  occupation  of those  advisers on  the  locustcampaign.  The  irrigation scheme has not yet been commenced.  The irrigation  of the Aujha  basin is a work of great importance and it is desirable that  it should be pushed on,  in so far as it lies in the  hands of the Administration to forward  it.   The originalconcession was given in the year  1922.   Eight years  have passedand so far nothing has been done.   It  is desirable that the schemeput  forward by the concessionnaires last year should be examined and reported upon  as soon as that  is  possible.     The  soonerirrigation is available for the plain the better.   Nebi Rubin. In the Maritime  Plain there is  an  area claimedas Waqf known  as  Nebi Rubin, which is now being drained, andarrangements made  for the irrigation by  the Supreme  MoslemCouncil.  The area capable of irrigation is some 5,000 dunams.   Theplan for this work of drainage and irrigation is stated to have  beenprepared by an engineer of the Rockefeller Foundation.  It is saidthat the  work  is  being carried  out  satisfactorily.   This   willprovide a useful area for the Arab tenants of the Waqf.   The Acre Plain. The Acre  Plain is said to be entirely irrigable,either from the  Kurdani Spring  (marked No.  2 on  Map No. 5)attached  to this  Report) or from  subterranean water  at a reason-able depth.  A large portion of this Plain is in the hands of Jewishorganisations.   As  yet the  practice of irrigation in  this area isnot  general.   The Huleh Area. The Huleh area is all irrigable.   The propertymight be  a very valuable one  and it  is regrettable that the  areaowned by the Government therein has passed almost in its entiretyout of the hands of the Government into the hands of a concession- naire, Selim Bey Salam of beyrout.   The concession was origin- ally made by the  Turkish Government before  the War,  but wasrenewed by the Government of Palestine.  The concessionnaire at one time desired to get rid of the concession and has been on various occasions in treaty with the Zionist Organisation  and  subsequently with the Walbrook  Trust.  The negotiations came to nothing in both cases, and the concession still exists.  The concessionnaire is about to commence operations with the object of draining a portion of the marsh by deepening the bed of the Jordan and so lowering the water level of the surface of the lake.   The question of the area of  the Huleh Basin and of the marsh haB been  discussed in detail in Chapter  I of this Report.  Apart from  the  areas in the boundaries of  the marsh already cultivated by the Bedu who live in the vicinity, there is an extent of perhaps 40,000 dunams which will  be  reclaimed  by the operations of the concessionnaire.   If the lake were completely drained, as is advis- able,  not only from  the point  of view of reclamation,  but  from the point of  view of  public health, the  additional  area  would be some 9,000 or 10,000 metric dunams.   In  Huleh,  the  extent of  a holding  necessary to support an agricultural family would not be greater than 40 dunams, of which half irrigated.  There will thus be a large reserve of land in that area, when it is properly developed.  The question of the  drainage
of the Lake was  considered  by Mr.  Henriques  and was reportedupon  in the volume of Reports  of the Experts at  p.  400.  Hisestimate is that to drain the Lake by blasting out the gorge through which the Jordan  river flows after leaving the  Lake, would cost over i&apos;1,000,000, to include deep  ploughing of the reclaimed area,drainage as might be necessary,  and arrangements for irrigation.  If the concession falls in,  as is possible, it seems  essential thatthe Government should retain the proprietary right in the area, for development purposes.  It would be worth  while  to compensatethe concessionnaire in a reasonable sum,  if by  so doing the con-cession could  be acquired from him.  At the moment there is nosymptom that such an offer  would be entertained, but  in view ofthe past history of the concession it is possible that  a favourable opportunity may recur.  The estimate of Mr. Henriques is that ofan expert, but was not founded on the  preparation of any detailed plans.  If the  Huleh area  should revert to  the Government,  a technical study should be made in order to ascertain the actual costof the suggested drainage.  The Beisan Area. Another area that has unfortunately  passedfrom  the ownership of the  Government consists of  the  lands ofBeisan, Semakh and Ghor-ul-Fara&apos;a, which  are  the subject of theagreement concluded in November, 1921,  and known as the GhorMudawwara Agreement.  It  was  probably politically desirable thatthe lands  covered by this Agreement  should be settled with  theArab  tenants  who had undoubtedly  enjoyed the use of the tractin the time of the Ottoman  Government.  At  the  same time theresult of  the  Agreement,  and specially  of the modification  of theAgreement made  in  September, 1928, published in  the  OfficialGazette of 16th September of that year have taken from the Gov-ernment the control of a large area of fertile land, eminently suitable to development and for which there is ample water  available forirrigation.  The area of the Beisan lands is discussed in Chapter I.  The  Beisan   Agreement.-&apos;By  the   original   Agreement  pro-perty   was   created   in   favour  of   the   existing  cultivatorsin  respect   of   the   lands  cultivated   by   them   (Art.  1).Article  5   provided   for   such   areas   of   IMetruke  land  as might be  &quot; necessary for the l-equirements  of  the  village &quot;.  Aminimum holding of 150 dunams  per  family was fixed by Article 8.In  Article  9  provision was  made for  the  constitution of  tribalareas, as also for the transfer of areas  to  families which have not hitherto cultivated, if the tribe to which they belong has generallylived  and  cultivated on the  West  side of Jordan.  Grazing areas for tribes are permitted to the extent determined by the Departmentof Agriculture.   In Article 16 is laid  down  that  there  should beno  disposition of  the  land  *&apos; except by way of mortgage  to theGovernment or of succession  ....  until  the whole transferprice (badal tatweeb)  has been paid &quot;.   This last was a very wiseprovision.   The revision of  the Agreement carried through in 1928 modifiedthis last condition. The following is the relevant extract from thestatement of  policy embodying the changes  in  the Agreement :       J&quot; 8. Government are prepared  under  certain conditions to waive tho    requirement that the whole transfer price must be paid before the    transferee has freedom to dispose of his surplus land.      &quot; The two  principal conditions which  attach to this modification of    Clause 16 i.re:      &quot; (1) that the surplus land be transferred  to  persons approved by    Government and having as their object the promotion of close settlement    and the intensive cultivation of  the land;  and      &quot; (2) that in every case shall the transferee retain such extent of land    in the area to which the Ghor Mudawwara Agreement of 1921  applies    or elsewhere  as  will in the  opinion of  tho Government suffice for the    maintenance of himself and  his family.&quot; &apos;  At  the time  of the original  agreement  clearly no  grant  of&apos;&quot; surplus land  &quot; to any individual was contemplated.   The  whole  of the Beisan lands have been  distributed, and large areas have already  been  sold.   Further large areas  are  in the market.  The grant of the lands has led  to  land speculation on a considerable  scale.  The  custom is  that  the vendor  transfers ta the vendee the  liability for the  price  of the land  still owing to
the Government and in  addition takes from  him  a sum varying from three to four pounds a dunam for land in the Jordan Valley.These  proceedings invalidate  the argument  which  was  used tosupport the original agreement.   It was made in order to providethe Arabs with  a holding sufficient to maintain a decent standardof life, not  to  provide  them  with areas of  land  with which tospeculate.  The  question of what is to be done in the matter ofBeisan  will  be  further discussed at a later  stage  in the present report.  As  to the  irrigation  of Beisan it is stated  that  there  is amplewater to irrigate all the cultivable area if the  water were properlyused.   At present it is used exceedingly uneconomically.  Under thepowers  which the  Government  propose  to  take under  the  DraftIrrigation Ordinance now under  consideration,  it will  be possibleso to regulate the use of the water that it will serve a much largerarea than is  the case at present.  There were complaints from the Arabs that  the  sources of thewater supply had passed into Jewish hands  and  that there  wasconsequent difficulty in obtaining the water  necessary for irrigation-tion.  It is true that certain of  the sources of irrigation water inthis area lie in lands now held by  the Jews.  If the Draft IrrigationOrdinance finally becomes law, all difficulty  on that score can be regulated.  The Jordan  Valley. In Chapter I above,  reference was madeto areas in the Jordan  Valley.  A comparison of the views of Dr.Strahorn expressed in the Report of the Experts at pp. 203 to 206,with the views  expressed by the members of  the Committee whoexamined the Lower Jordan Valley this year  for the purposes ofthe present enquiry, shows  that  there is room  for wide difference of opinion.   The Irrigation  Officer and  the Government Geologistare convinced of the possibility of cultivation  of considerable areasin that  valley if  water proves available.   The  Committee of whichthey were members reported  the possibility  of the irrigation of100,000 dunams in addition to that already irrigated, with the wateralready available, if that water is economically used.   It is well within the bounds of possibility,  both that arrangements could bemade which  will provide a larger supply of water  than that atpresent in sight, and that  a larger area of land may prove to becultivable than  is  at present recognised and  included  in  thecultivable area.  Other possibilities. The remarks recorded above have  referenceonly to certain of the known sources  of irrigation.   It  is urgently necessary that attempts should be made to discover  further sources.Both  in the  course  of  the settlement of  the  refugees  in Greece,and more recently  in  Cyprus, steps were taken to determine thesubterranean supply.     In  both countries  these enquiries  are believed to have resulted in success.   In Macedonia,  in  Thrace,and in  Old Greece,  an artesian supply  was discovered which hasresulted in the sinking of hundreds of wells  which  give a copiousyield  of water.   It  is  well possible that serious attempts might result in  a similar  discovery in  Palestine.   As has already  beenremarked,  the discovery of an  artesian  supply of water  in  theBeersheba region would  revolutionise the possibilities of colonisa-tion in  Palestine.  It is worth while to devote a considerable sum to a hydrographic survey of Palestine in the  hope  of locating thewater-table  both of  spring  water and  of artesian water, if  thelatter exists.   A study of all existing sources of irrigation shouldalso be undertaken,  and plans prepared for scientific and economicuse of the water in question.  The Draft  Irrigation Ordinance. In Appendix 19 will  be  founda resume of  the Draft Irrigation Ordinance.   Legislation to  em-power the Government to regulate the use of  water for irrigationshould be enacted as rapidly as  possible.  It is a question for theGovernment  whether  the powers contained  in the Draft  Ordin-ance for control over the  sinking of wells is necessary.  There  was at one time a fear that the multiplication of wells in the MaritimePlain had caused a fall in the water-table in that area.  The matter was examined by an expert  Committee which  came to the conclu--\.sion that the fear was not well founded.  The  water-table  had
fallen in a certain region, but there remained an ample supply atthe deeper level.  Constitution of a separate service. By an  unusual arrangementthe  Irrigation Service  is also  placed  under the control of  theDepartment of Agriculture.  The question of the irrigation service will be  dealt with at a later stage in this  Report, but the opinionmay be recorded here that this arrangement is not satisfactory.In fact, it has resulted in the Irrigation Officer being employed, andnecessarily employed, on urgent duties not connected with irrigation-tion.  For instance, during a considerable  part of the present yearhe was  engaged on a locust campaign.  This  was doubtless a workof great urgency,  but while he was thus employed his regular work as Irrigation  Officer was in abeyance.   That work  is of the first importance in view of the backward state of irrigation in Palestine.I recommend that the Irrigation Service should be detached fromthe Department  of  Agriculture and constituted  a separate service.                        D. CO-OPERATION.  The  Jewish   movement.    Information  available. A  notablefeature  in  connection with Jewish immigration  and  settlement isthe rapid growth of co-operation.  The  fact may  be  due to  theinfluence of the  countries whence the immigrants have come, forthe movement is powerful both in Poland and in Russia, the  coun-tries of origin of  66 per cent, of the Jewish  settlers.   The- move-ment is confined to the  Jews.  There is no  Arab Co-operative society at  work in Palestine.  There are 249 co-operative societies registered, but of them only173 are known  to be working.  The  live societies are classified asfollows :     Agricultural societies  ...     ...     ...     ...     ...    39    Credit societies       ...     ...     ...     ...     ...    52    Industrial producers   ...     ...     ...     ...     ...    27    Land purchase and building       ...     ...     ...    34    Kvotzoth       ...     ...     ...     ...     ...           14    Miscellaneous   ...     ...     ...     ...     ...     ...     7  Data have been collected for 134 of these societies as at the endof May, 1930, and have been submitted by Mr. Harry Viteles, theGeneral Manager of the Central Bank of Co-operative institutions in Palestine.  These 134 Jewish co-operatives had at that date 33,436 members,and  share capital, reserves and other owned  capital amounting  to 334,827.   In addition to this sum, they have in members&apos; deposits and  savings  711,445.  At the same time the total indebtedness tobanks  and other creditors was  294,411.  In  fact, the co-operative societies work, to a large  extent, on the money provided by their members, a position highly satisfactory.   Rates of  interest on deposits and loans. High rates of  interestare paid both on deposits and on loans from Banks, and the society-ties  charge  their members 10 to 13 per cent,  on the loans  and  ad-vanoes  made  to  them.  This rate  of  interest is not  only  high  initself, but is an indication of the still higher rates which are  charged by the  moneylender.  If the general rate of  interest  charged else-where  for accommodation  of the  kind furnished by  the Societieswere not excessive, and it is known to be excessive, it  would clearly not  be  to the advantage of the small  man in the town and in  the village  to resoi&quot;t to a co-operative which demands 10 to 13 per cent.The fact is  also an indication of the uselessness of the legal limit of9 per cent.   On this question of the  rate of interest Mr. Viteles remarks inhis note :                     .               .             .     A    * &apos;   *-     &quot; This  interest is  out of proportion to the  earning  capacity of tho    population-particularly of the farmers served  by  the co-operatives.&quot;   Activities  of  Co-operative  Societies. The  Agricultural societiesare of  many types and serve every  purpose of  the settler.  through them he makes his purchases and  sells his products, through themhe insures his cattle,  through them again he receives advances  onhis crops.   Of these societies there  are some which are of outstand-ing  merit.   The  &quot; Pardess &quot;  Co-operative   Society  of  OrangeGrowers shipped during the last season over 470,000 cases of oranges
belonging to its members,  about 40 per cent,  of  the  total orangecrop of Jewish growers.   It has just opened a co-operative packinghouse with  a capacity of 60,000 cases, equipped with  the latestgrading and  packing machinery.  This society also  interests itself in the development of existing markets and the discovery  of newavenues of disposal.   Of the wine  produced in Palestine, 90 percent, is manufactured and  sold  by  a co-operative society of wine-growers.  &quot;  Hamashbir  &quot; is a society established  and  managed bythe  Jewish   Federation  of  Labour.   It serves  as a  Co-operative wholesale iSociety and  the central  organ  of  the  four consumers&apos;(distributive)  societies already  in existence.  More of  the lattertype are contemplated in rural localities. The co-operative market-ing of milk  and  dairy products, eggs  and  poultry and vegetables,formerly constituting  a  branch of the activities of &quot; Hamashbir,&quot;have been taken over by  three autonomous co-operatives functioningin Jerusalem,  Tel-Aviv  and  Haifa  respectively,  under  the name&quot; Thnuva.&quot;   The  produce sold by  these three bodies during theyear ending 30th September exceeded in value the sum of  96,000,and is rapidly increasing.  Another  co-operative connected with theLabour Federation is &quot; Yakhin,&quot; which undertakes the preparation,planting and maintenance  of agricultural holdings,  particularly ofcitrus groves.  This work is done both for  residents  in the countryand  for prospective settlers.  The society commenced in the middleof 1928, and had completed work of a value of   49,000 before the close of 1929.  The contracts on hand on 31st May,  1930,  were for 32,000.  Jetcish Co-operative  Movement: Co-operative Industrial  Pro-ducers&apos;  Societies. The  Labour  Federation  has  organised a specialDepartment  to promote and to  supervise  Co-operative IndustrialProducers&apos; Societies.  At the end of 1928 there were 50 such society-ties  with a  total  of  326 members, an  average  of less than 7 persociety.   At the  end of  May, 1930,  there were 41 with a member-ship of 507, more than 12 per society.  In addition to the members,these societies employed 235 hired  workers and apprentices.   Themost remarkable of the societies of this type are  the transport society-ties,  in which the members transfer to the society the proper^&apos; inthen- motor vehicles and are credited with the capital value as their share capital.  It is  said that these  societies command most of theinternal traction of the city of Jerusalem and town of Tel-Aviv anda  large proportion of the  commercial  transport between-een  the twoplaces.   Land-purchasing Societies. A considerable number of the moreimportant  co-operative   societies  are   those   which   have  been organised for the purchase of land both in rural and in urban areas.In the case of the former type of transaction, the land  is frequentlybought and  developed for  members not yet resident in Palestine,but  who  hope to immigrate later.   The total present  value of theland, improvements,  buildings,  etc., the property of members ofthese societies, is reported to  be  nearly  one  and a-half millionpounds.   Jewish Co-operative Movement:  Membership of Societies. It isclear that the co-operative movement has not only been successfullylaunched among the Jewish population, but has already become  a highly  important economic factor in the daily life.  On the whole the  societies are extremely  well-managed.   Some of  the Credit Societies appear to be too large for  efficient control by  the membersthemselves.   There is one with over 3,000 members, there  are eightwith membership in excess  of 1,000.   In other cases  there  is  a tendency in the opposite direction, and new members are not wel-welcomed.   But there can  be no doubt that the co-operative societies are  doing magnificent work  and are a valuable asset both to  the villages and to the residents in the towns.   Necessity for extension to Arab population. As has been pointed out, the whole  of  the co-operative organisation in  Palestine is Jewish.  It is very much to be regretted that no efforts have as yet been made  to popularise  the  co-operative idea  among  the Arab population.   The need  is desperately urgent.   The fellah popula- tion is so tightly bound in debt  that no credit whatever is available to enable that development of  agriculture  which is  so essential for progress.
  The  view is commonly  expressed that  the Arab will  not  co-operate.  It is said that one attempt was made to form a co-opera-tive society of the tobacco growers, but that the society failed owingto the disloyalty of its members.   The great probability is that thecause of failure might be found either in ignorance of the  principlesof co-operation  or  in the constitution of the society.   The  Arab isignorant, but he  is  at  the  same  time highly intelligent and  hard-working.  That he can learn is evident from  ar/inspection of theArab villages in proximity  to the German and to the older Jewish(P.I.C.A.) colonies.   That  he is ready for practical co-operation ispatent from instances which have been observed recently.  One case was noticed in  a  village close to  the  German  colony of Wilhelma.There three fellahin desired to  have the use of a  tractor and tacklefor deep ploughing.   No one  of the three could afford the expensesof transport.  The three joined together,  hired the outfit,  had all three  holdings ploughed  and  shared  the  expense.  In  anothervillage, near Ramleh, a case was observed in which five  cultivatorspooled  their teams in order that power  might  be  available for deepploughing.   Those  cases,  though  perhaps  of little intrinsic  im-portance, indicate that the co-operative  sense is  not absent in theArab cultivator.   There  is  nothing but co-operation that will save  him from his present depression.  He cannot hope ever to escape from the burdenof debt unless cheaper  credit  is made available.   Only by co-opei a-tion  can that  object  be obtained.   It is  well  that Mr.  G.  S.Striokland  is making an enquiry into  the  methods by which co-operation may  be  made available  for the  fellahin of Palestine.   Treatment of  existing  debts. One  of  the  most  difficult  of questions  in approaching the problem  of the  foundation of ArabCo-ojieration Societies,  is the  policy to be  followed in  respect ofexisting debts.   As  has been noted, these  are everywhere  exceed-ingly heavy, and  the prospect of agricultural  development of theArab holdings, a  development which  will  be  dependent  on  thefacility for obtaining working capital at a reasonable price, is at themoment rendered  impossible.   The Arab is  crippled by debt.  Hischance of advance is hampered by debt.  How is he  to be released from his  burden  as a preliminary to  improving his chances of advance?   Mr.  Strickland, who was in Palestine at the time of this enquiry,and was himself examining the possibilities of co-operation amongthe Arab population, favoured  me with  a  note on  the clearance of old debts in co-operative societies.   His considered opinion is hostile to a  policy  of loans  at low rate of interest  in order to  enable the peasant to pay off existing  debts at high rates of interest.   In thecourse  of his memorandum he  writes :      &quot; .  . . .  My own  experience miring twenty  years of co-operation lias    been everywhere tho same.  An indebted and usually illiterate peasant    has not  the strength of character to refrain from  further borrowing    from  money-lenders, if he is suddenly released  from  debt.   He borrows    again and all the good work is undone.   After trying several methods I    found the best way in a rural  Society of Credit to be the limitation of    loans in  the earlier years  to such amounts as would meet the agricul-    tural and ordinary needs  of tho members without  attempting  to repay    the old debt.  At the end  of three years, if it was  found that the mem-    bers had broken off all connection with their old source of credit, a list    of the debts of each member was drawn  up,  and a special loan for the    repayment of tho total amount made to a number of selected persons,    but not  to all  the members at the same moment.   Tims by clearing a    few members in each year by  a special  loan the Society was kept in a    constant state of struggle,  which, however, unpleasant, is extremely    beneficial to tho -co-operative character of tho persons concerned.&quot;   He  adds  that the  Jewish Credit Societies apply the same policy-of refusal at once  to  clear the debts of a new member.   At a later stage of the memorandum, Mr. Strickland  writes :     &quot; ....  I do not consider that peasants who have become accustomed to     a condition of permanent indebtedness can bo taught to help themselves,     except by an unpleasant and somewhat long course  of discipline.  There-     fore they must for  two or three years  prove their loyalty  to their     Society by dealing in small sums.  This process forms their  character     and makes them such men  as can be trusted with large sums.  They must     also have the courage to defy  the moneylender and boldly invite him to     go  to court.  Whon he does so tho Society can  help thorn,  but  a total     payment of  their debt at an  early date is  too strong a medicine for     them to digest, while a partial  payment of a  moneylenders debt is a
    mere  waste of money.  When crediting it lie charges  the full rate of    interest, but when coining to a final settlement he will a^ree to a lower    rate.&quot;  It is exceedingly satisfactory that this question of credit  for tirefellah is at the  moment  the  subject  of enquiry  by an expert inco-operation, and that there is justification  for the  hope that thebest steps possible will be taken to improve the  prospects  of this important class  of agriculturalists  in financing their agriculturaloperations.   Nothing  is more  important from the point of view ofthe agricultural development of the country.  Desirability  of joint action  between  Jews and  Arabs. In viewof the great desirability of a reapproachment between the  arab and the  Jewish  population of Palestine, it would be of advantage if the Jewish co-operative societies were to encourage  Arab member-ship. In the case of  &quot; Pardess,&quot; for example, it would be  to theadvantage of the Jewish orange  growers themselves, to enlist theArab growers in their Society.  As is pointed out elsewhere in thisReport,  the  price of oranges  abroad is  based  on the  price of thecases of  least merit.  The higher  the quality  of the inferior product,the better for those who ship oranges of good quality, well-gradedand well packed. If &quot; Pardess &quot; were to lay itself out to serve theArab groves as well as the Jewish, it  would obtain  its rew*ard in ageneral  rise  in the standard of the cases  shipped from Palestine.And this is only one of the directions in which enlistment of Arabcultivators would actually strengthen the co-operatives of the Jews.In addition,  naturally, the political difference would tend to  become less acute than is  at present the case.  The more the Jew canidentify  himself  with  the economic interests  of the Arab, the better for the  general  peace of  the  country.   Nothing  is  more fatal  forthe peace of Palestine than emphasis on the difference rather thanon  the common  interests of the two constituents of the population.                       CHAPTER VIII.                      Agricultural  Produce.                     (a) CITRUS CULTIVATION.  Origin of orange cultivation. The cultivation of  the orange, in-introduced by  the Arabs before  the commencement of Jewish settle-ment, has developed to a very great extent in consequence of that settlement.  There is no doubt that the pitch of perfection to whichthe technique of plantation and cultivation of the orange and grape-fruit have  been brought in Palestine is due to the scientific methodsof the Jewish agriculturist.  Area available. In  the  Reports of the Experts  at page  199 etseq there is an interesting statement of the opinion of Dr. Strahornas to the areas in  which citrus cultivation is in his opinion possible.His deduction on this subject is to be found  on Page  201  and is recorded  in   the  following words :--&quot; ...  It  is  felt  that  the absolute area of irrigated  plantations  in Palestine will  not  exceed300,000  dunams.&quot;   This  is a very important pronouncement  byan  expert  of world-wide reputation.   This question is  dealt  within  the Memorandum submitted during the course  of  the presentenquiry.  The experts  of the Jewish Agency do not agree with theopinion thus expressed by Dr.  Strahorn;  on the  contrary,  theyconsider that there  are  595,000 dunams in  the  Maritime  Plainwhich are  irrigable  and of  the light soil usually found suitable fororange cultivation.   Including the  irrigable area of the Beershebaseries of soils,  which they  take  as  503,347, and deducting  anassumed area for  &quot;  nasaz,&quot; they conclude that an area of 500,000dunams  is  suitable for citrus cultivation.   &quot; Nasaz  &quot; is  thusdescribed by  Dr.  Strahorn :      &quot; The term &apos; nasaz  &apos; indicates a sub-soil structure where,  due to some    peculiarity, the  horizon is but  very slowly pervious to moisture, and    the structure is sufficiently dense to cause most  roots of plants  to turn    and follow a horizontal direction.  In boring the soil,  auger encounters    a definite  resistance where  tho &apos; nasaz &apos; horizon is penetrated.  mechinisation-    cal analyses seldom show a  texture heavier than a sticky loam or  a sandy    loam, and fine sandy  loam textures seem quite prevalent ....   As &amp;    rule,  &apos; nasaz &apos; is non-calcareous  . .  . .&quot;
  It is, of course, impossible to determine the &quot; nasaz &quot; area byinspection of the surface soil.  That area will only be determinedwhen a soil survey, which includes an examination of the sub-soil,is completed.  All that can safely be said on the subject of the irrigable light soilfit for orange cultivation in the Maritime Plain  is that there appearsto he  an area of about  200,000 dunams  still available  and un-developed, and that this  area would provide  for 10,000 holdings,if  the price of oranges in  the European Market  does not fallmaterially.  In addition there is an area, estimated by the experts of the Jewish  Agency  at  300,000 dunams, which  may prove on examination to be suitable  for citrus.   Should  this  anticipationprove  correct,  and the largely  increased area not result in  a fallin the price of  oranges, this  area would  provide for another 15,000families.  Area under citrus cultivation. Details of the  areas  now  underorange cultivation and of export and prices are given in Appendix20.  It is generally assumed that  this fruit,  may  be successfullycultivated  in the whole  of the  soil suitable to its  growth.  Alimiting factor may prove  to  be that of water  for irrigation,  incertain regions.   Hitherto  water has  been   found  at reasonabledepth, ranging from 9 metres to 53 metres (Report of the Experts,p. 26). In general tube wells are used, with filters, and the piumpsare worked either  with oil engines or by  electric power obtainedfrom the Palestine Electric  Corporation.  East year  there  weresymptoms  which seemed to  indicate  that  the water-table wasreceding in depth.  There were also complaints that salt water had penetrated into certain of the  wells.  An enquiry was held intothe  matter, and it was  found that in  the  region  where  orangecultivation had been longest in  vogue, there had in  fact been a fall of about 4 metres in the level  of the springs, but that the supply at this lower depth was  ample.  It was also considered that thefall  was possibly due to temporary conditions, following as  it didtwo years of rainfall below the average.  As  to the salt, this was found in two wells only.  No explanation of the phenomenon couldbe  suggested, as these  two wells were in close proximity to otherwells in which the water was sweet.  Future of the orange  trade. It is unsafe to prophesy  on the subject of the  future of the  orange trade.  Opinions among experts in  Palestine vary.  On the whole  they  are optimistic.  The chief orange growers feel little doubt that a. crop of ten or twelve million cases will be absorbed  by the European market.  They realise that the possibility of that  absorption will depend in large measure on the method in which  the oranges are  marketed.  At  the  present time  this leaves much to be  desired.   The Jewish growers  are taking steps to ensure by  co-operation that the standard  of  the fruit  despatcher from their groves is uniform  and that grading and packing are satisfactory.  It is regrettable that the Arab growers are not yet convinced of the necessity of the adoption of  similar measures.   The question of  the future  of  the orange  trade  is  one  of very great importance  for  the development of agricultural Palestine. In the main, it is the  development of this particular culture which will  justify  the belief  that the country can support a much larger population than it contains at  present.  If the market can absorb, within  the  next ten  or  twelve years,  some 30 million  cases  of oranges, where to-day  it is absorbing less  than 3 million,  the 200,000  dunams,  which  is the  minimum area still awaiting de- velopment in the Maritime Plain, will support a  population  of at least ten thousand  families of orange  growers, with the ancil- lary  population connected  with  the  business  of  an  area  which to-day is  supporting probably  less than 2,000 families.    Should the suitable area  prove  to  be  larger than 200,000 dunams, as is reported by the experts  recently employed by the Jewish Agency, and whose  opinions differ  from that of Dr. Strahorn,  the addi- tional population supportable will be increased  pro  tanto.   On  the  other hand,  if  development goes on  at  the  present pace, and the  market proves unable to digest the enormous increase in supply, not only will disaster  overtake the  new families who may  be settled in the  Maritime Plain in the future, but the large
population now settled in that region will  share  in  the disaster.It is the path  of  wisdom to proceed with  the  policy  of  orangeplantation without,  undue  precipitancy  and to await the  resultof the work of the past  four years before  embarking on a moreambitious scheme of the  same kind.                     (b)  THE GRAPE FRUIT.  Of orange  groves  now   planted,  one-tenth   of  the  area ishabitually put under grape-fruit.    For this the  market is satis-factory,  and  is  expanding.    The  Palestinian  grape-fruit is of very fine quality, and there  is in this direction  every probability of a large and  increasing trade.  An additional advantage in the cultivation of  the grape-fruitlies in the fact that it flourishes in  soils much too heavy to permit of successful  cultivation  of the orange,  and there is  room  in the jordan  Valley for considerable  extension of the  area under  thiscrop.  The  drawback to the grape-fruit  is its quality  as eminentlya luxury  fruit.    This is even more the case than with  the Jaffaorange.    The  grape-fruit requires  preparation before  it  can beeaten.    It also requires sugar.    The Jaffa  orange  is  easilyeaten, without  preparation and  also without sugar.    It  cannot therefore be expected that the area ultimately planted with  grape-fruit  will ever compare with  the area under oranges,  but,  never-theless,  it will  in the end be sufficiently considerable to warranta place in a development programme.                        (c) THE  BANANA.Area under cultivation.  Careful enquiry has established that the  area under the  bananain  Palestine  in  1930 amounts to  2,368 dunams.  The  fruit  canbe  grown in the whole of  the  Jordan  Valley where the  soil  is fertile.    It  is  also grown  in  a  few  areas outside  the  jordan valley,  but with more difficulty.Cost of -production  and  yield.   The  cost of production is   37 a dunam up to  the  bearing stage and thereafter  18  per  annum  for maintenance.    At 15  mils a kilo, with  a yield  of 2,000  kilos  from  a  dunam  in  full bearing, the gross annual income is  30.   This year the price is very  low, and the growers have found  difficulty in disposing of  their fruit. Marketing possibilities.   The Palestine banana is a fruit of excellent quality in consump- tion,  though  its appearance leaves much  to be desired.    The whole  question  of  cultivation  and marketing  was  discussed  at length  by  Mr.  George  M.  Odium, in  a  report  to  the Palestine Economic  Corporation in 1927.   This has been published, by the courtesy of  the  Corporation,  as a leaflet  of the Department  of Agriculture in Palestine (No. 11).   The  general result at which Mr. Odium  arrives does not encourage the hope that the possi- bility of creating a market  in  the banana will  afford scope for widespread extension  of cultivation.    He  sees &quot; considerable possibilities  for  a   banana  industry of moderate dimensions  in Palestine.&quot;   The  difficulty  is  largely  one of marketing.   The Palestine  fruit  could not compete  with   the Canary  and West Indian  bananas in  Western  Europe.  It is bound to be restricted to local markets and the undeveloped markets of Eastern  Europe. The possibility  of expansion in  these latter markets should how- ever be explored,  and  meanwhile the methods  of  packing and transporting the fruit improved.   It is a  matter of  great regret that the nematode  (Egyptian eelworm)  (from which Mr.  Odium recorded that Palestine  was free), has now appeared and is found spread generally among the banana groves of the country.
                          (d) MELONS.Exports  to Egypt and Syria.  There  is a very  large trade in water-melons  with Egypt and a smaller,  but still considerable,  trade with Syria.   The  former,in 1929,  amounted to 49,000  tons, the  latter  in 1928  to 6,800.In both  directions  the trade  has been  affected by fiscal measures.In Egypt on import duty of 500 milliemes per ton was imposed lastyear.    In  Syria the town  of  Damascus has  imposed  an octroiduty or.  melons, which  is of course of a  general  nature, affectingSyrian as well  as Palestinian melons, but which at  the same timetends to  reduce the amount exported from Palestine.Adverse  effect on export  of imposts in  Egypt and Syria.  Complaint on  the score of these imposts  was general,  and  itwas suggested  that the  Syrian case should be taken  up  with theFrench  Government and that in the Egyptian  case the  palestine government should  retaliate by penalizing imports from thatcountry.    Petitions on the subject  were submitted to the Pales-tine  Government.    The  District  Commissioner  of Haifa,  inreporting on the Egyptian question, gave figures which  establishthat  the cost of  transport of a  ten-ton truck, including  transport to the railway, cost of loading, demurrage fee, unloading  and corn-mission,  and customs clues,  totalled  .i&apos;P25,005.    The averagewholesale prices in  Egypt  range from  .4220 to  25 per  ten-tontruck,  and  there is consequently little  or no  profit to  the pro-producer in Palestine.   He was of  the opinion that  the hew tariffwill seriously affect the  trade in melons.  The  matter  is one for  negotiation with the  Egyptian Govern-ment.    The balance of  trade  is so seriously  adverse  to  Pales-tine  that every  possible  effort should be made to encourage  itscxnorts.    Of these the melon  holds quite an important  place.  The  Syrian question is more difficult.    No preference is beingaccorded  to Syrian  melons.    Doubtless the  Damascus   Muni-cinalitv  requires  the additional income  which  the octroi on  melonswill afford.   It  does not seem  possible  to suggest  that  Palestinemelons  should have a preference over  the   local  product  in theDamascus  market,  and  probably  no steps can  usefully  be takenin the  matter.                          (e)  ALMONDS.Production  and Export figures.  Appendix 21 gives the figures of production and of export from three  sources.    It is unsatisfactory that they differ so  widely,and a  remarkable  fact that  is indicated  by  those  figures  is that over a  period of  seven years  the total export  of almonds  has beenfar. in  excess of the  total production.    No explanation  of  this fact can  be offered, unless it  can be  attributed to  under-estimationof the crop for purposes of assessment of  tithe.Area under Almond cultivation.  The  most recent enquiry into  the area under almonds was madein the  early months of 1927.  It indicated a  total area under thistree of 27,776  dunams,  of which 21,175 were in  Jewish colonies.The  tree is easy to cultivate and flourishes on  land which is un-suitable  for plantation  of any other  kind.   It  gives a return perdunam  six  times that of cereal  crops.   It  is  therefore a usefulculture  for the development of poor soil.Replacement of  Almonds by  Oranges.  The area  under  almonds  has been affected  by  the popularityof the orange.    Even before the enquiry in 1927  a considerablearea of  almond groves had been uprooted in  order  to make room for oranges, and in certain  cases for  grapes.   In the  report ofthe Department  of Agriculture  for 1925  it  was already recordedthat :     &quot; Licencos  hnve been  issued in  considerable  number for  tho felling   of almond trees affected  with gummosis, or borer ....  Almonds aro   giving way  to apricots  and ligs which,  in  improved  varieties and.   properly  dried,  command  ready  local  sales  at  very   favourable   prices . . . .&quot;
 Since that time the cultivation of the orange has advanced  with great rapidity, and  wherever the land is suitable  there is a ten- dency for the orange to replace the  almond. Pests.   In the  heavier  soils the borer has done very serious damage, but in the poorer soils the almond groves are frequently unaffected by this  pest.   The same is the case with gummosis. Markets.   In 1929  a consignment of  almonds was forwarded to England and handled by the Empire Marketing Board.    The  report was not very encouraging,  but in the issues of the &quot; Grocer &amp; Oil Trade  Review &quot;  of  11th  August  and 15th  September  of  that year Jordan almonds were quoted  at  the highest  price in  the London market.    On the former  date  the best Jordans sold for more than the best  Valencias.   The chief markets are in Egypt and Damascus, in both of which centres large quantities are imported.   There is no doubt that  at recent  prices, almond  cultivation has been a paying proposition, and in view of the suitability of the tree to  the poorer soils, it  will doubtless  take  its place  in any  general scheme of agricultural  development for Palestine.                           (f) GRAPES. Exports of Wine.   Table grapes and grapes for wine are both cultivated in consider- able areas in Palestine.  But both in the case of wine manufactured in  the country  and in  the case of grapes for the  table,  the export trade has suffered  a severe and continued set-back during the  past seven years.  In 1922  over 2,700,000 litres of  wine were exported of  a declared value of  58,821.  In  1927  the corresponding figures are, quantity slightly in excess of 900,000 litres, value  21,686. Exports of Table Grapes.   In 1922,  1,334 tons of table grapes were exported.  In 1928 the figure had fallen to 246  tons. Competition in  the nuirkets.  In the case both of wine and of table grapes the most active market is Egypt.  During the years 1922  to  1927 the export to Egypt fell from 1,175,000  litres to 564,000.  The reason  did not lie in a general reduction of imports of wine to Egypt; on the contrary that import shows  a large  increase.   Wines of the Palestinian  type are  manufactured  also in Cyprus and in  Greece,  and  i  tis the increase  of  the  export  from these two sources  which  has replaced the  loss  in imports from  Palestine.   To  quote from an article in the Bulletin of  the Palestine Economic Society, of  October, 1928, written by Mr. Harry Viteles :        &quot; Palestine  is  losing the wine markets  in Egypt,  Syria,  and the    United Kingdom, primarily because it appears to  be unable to  compete    with tho other wine-producing countries . .  . .&quot;  Still more evident is the successful competition of Cyprus  and Greece (with Crete) in  the matter of table grapes.  Since 1922 the the import of table  grapes  from Cyprus to Egypt has  increased from 261  tons to 1,338 tons  in  1927;  that  from Greece and Crete from from 3,141 tons to  5,068 tons. Trial consignments to London.  A trial consignment  of  table grapes was on two  occasions  sentto London  and was  dealt  with  on  each  occasion by the  empire marketing Board.  The reports were not very favourable, but theyindicated that given better methods  of harvesting the fruit, mostof which arrived in a condition over-ripe,  there  was a prospect of a market for certain of the varieties submitted, specially the Salti.
Complaints against Excise Duty and Licence Fees.  In  the  course of my enquiry a representation was made by the&quot; Cooperative   Society  of  Vine-Growers  of  liichon-le-Zion  andZicrOn-Jacob  Cellars &quot; on the subject of  the very heavy recentincreases  in the licence fees for manufacture and in the Excise dutyon  intoxicating  liquors.  From  this  representation  the following is  extracted  -      &quot; Licence Fees:  As a matter of fact, up  to 1925  we have paid P. 5    per annum.  By successive  additions  the Licence Fees have  been in-    creased to the amount of P. 2,250  for the  current  year;  P. 1,600 for    the manufacture of wine and P. 050 for the manufacture of alcohol and    other spirits.      &quot; We do pay Licence Fees  for manufacture  of alcohol  that  are  15    times  as big  as the Licence Fees existing now  in  England, and  with    regard to Licence for manufacture of wine, we don&apos;t know any country    where  such Licence Fee should exist, meanwhile  wo  are paying a little    less than one  mil per litre, making P. 1,G00.      &quot; Should the Government continue to impose tho Licence Fees to the    actual  level,  it would  practically mean taking  from the  viticulturist    P. 0.250 per  kantar of grapes for the licence only.      &quot; It  is indirectly a  tax imposed on the viticulturists, and since the    average crop  of a dunam is two kantars of  raisins,  this tax will be to    P. 0.500 per dunam.   The  question  is  if the viticulturist should pay    so heavy a tax in addition to the other land taxes as Osher and Werke,    and if  a  land  product should be so heavily taxed  . .  . .&quot;  It  is  true that the  cultivator of  grapes  pays the tithe  and  theWerko as stated, and that the increase in the Ijicence Fees  doesin  effect  impose an additional tax on him, as it is  impossible forthe manufacturer to increase the price of his  product  to the  con-sumer.   This is a question  which deserves careful reconsiderationin view of  the  depressed  condition of all  agricultural  industry  atthe present time.  A similar complaint  was made by the Saiesian Fathers in respectof the manufacture of  wine at their Farm  School at Beit Jemal.  The Excise Duty  was first imposed  by  the  Intoxicating LiquorOrdinance of 1927, and amounted to  3 mils per  litre of wine  notexceeding loD of alcohol, and  six mils per litre exceeding 150  butnot  exceeding  250.  These  duties were doubled  with  effect from 1st April, 1930.  The petition asks that the increase may be  can-celled and the old Duty remain in force.                           (g)  TOBACCO.Extent of  the  Tobacco  Trade.   There  is no  reason why  this country should not produce largeamounts  of high-class tobacco.  At the present time,  the amountproduced is of  poor  quality  and until  1929 has been insufficient tomeet the  demand for home consumption.   The following statementshows for  the  past three  years the  amount produced,  the amountconsumed locally, and the amount imported :   	1027.	102S.	1029.Crop  Tobacco Tombac Disposal of Crop  Tobacco to factoiies ...

800872Local  Leaf.  Attempts  have  been made  by  the cigarette  manufacturers to induce  the cultivators to produce in this country the  amount of tobacco of a higher class which is necessary for the manufacture ofcigarettes  of  better  quality.    These  attempts have  not  been successful.   The  local cultivator  prefers  a  tobacco  which gives alarge yield.  The  seed of the  better grade of plant is smaller andlighter than that of the  coarser tobacoo,  and for this reason aioneis unacceptable.  In  addition, the cultivator cannot realise that a smaller crop of the finer leaf is more valuable than a  heavier crop.of the coarser  kinds.Necessity  for instruction  in  improvement of methods.  This prejudice  might perhaps be overcome, but there is an  addi-tional  difficulty in that the finer tobacco requires  manipulation ofa special kind, with which the  Palestinian cultivator is not familiar.He does not know- how to prepare his tobacco for the market, nor does he know the method of packing.  Both of these difficulties areeasily  overcome.   It is a question of education, and an expert  from cyprus or  Greece could  readily  teach  the  cultivator.  The  Arabcultivator  is intelligent,  and, if taught, would find  no difficulty inlearning the methods  of those countries.  One  of  the  tobacco manufacturing firms advanced   20,000 tothe  tobacco growers  in  the  course  of last year.  The result  was entirely satisfactory,  and the monev has  been  repaid  practically infull.   .Complaints in regard to the Tobacco Ordinance.   There were complaints of two different kinds against the adminis-tration of the  Tobacco  Ordinance.   On  the part  of the cigarettemerchants it is alleged that smuggling is rife, especially after the disturbances of August  last,  and it was urged  that much  more severe measures are required on the part  of the authorities in  orderto combat that evil.   On the  other  side  there were frequent  corn-plaints on the  part of the fellahin that  the Tobacco Ordinance isnot only severe in its terms, but is, in addition, administered  in acruel manner.Minimum Area of Two Dunams.   There are certain provisions of the Ordinance which are specialsubjects of complaint.  It is,  for instance,  argued that there  is no good reason why the minimum area of cultivation should  be twodunams.   On  the face of it the  complaint  is well founded.   Thereason for the provision  is given in the following  extract  from aletter  of the Director of Customs, Excise  and Trade :     &quot; .... It  is desirable  that  tobacco shall only be  grown on a  com-    mercial scale and if it is assumed that 50 kilograms is the average crop    of  a dunam two dunams produce  100 kilograms or  five bales of 20 kilo-    grams each  .... If you refer to Section  10  of the Tobacco Ordinance    you will  find that  no quantity of less than 20 kilograms of Unmanufactured-    factured tobacco may bo sold  at  any one time by  a grower to  a dealer    or manufacturer, and it was  found  that people who  grow small  areas    in most cases were planting  for  their own consumption or illegal sale    and small areas are very difficult to control.  I have taken  the liberal    view of the two dunams  so that if a fellah  has two  pieces of land within    sight of each other  but not  actually  touching, I count  them as one for    the purposes  of the Law even if the total of each  is  less than two    dunams.  The  interests  of the tobacco manufacturers are those of the    Department  in this matter and they are always  consulted when any    change is made in the Ordinance.       &quot; A committee of representatives of the Departments of Agriculture    and Customs  and of Tobacco Growers and Manufacturers was held in    192G.   This Committee  recommended  that the minimum area planted by   &quot;any one grower should not be less than half a dunam,  but later it was    considered desirable to increaso the area to two dunams  . . . .&quot;   The reason  why the minimum  was  fixed  at two  dunams wasdoubtless  to check the consumption  of unexcised tobacco.  In  fact, however,  it precludes the poorer man from cultivating a crop which gives  a very high return.   It is desirable that the minimum area should  be  fixed  at  a lower  figure than  two  dunams.   Half a dunam appears a sufficiently  high minimum. Prohibition of use of home grown Tobacco.   Another provision which  is subject to  bitter criticism  is  that which renders  it a criminal  offence  for the cultivator to smoke hia,
own home-grown tobacco.  It is rightly pointed out that  compul-sion to  purchase excised tobacco raises the price to the cultivatorby  about 60 per cent.  On the other hand it is clear that if thecultivator were  to  be  allowed to smoke his own  tobacco, a doorwould be opened for illicit consumption which might have serious results on the excise revenue.  The following table gives the number  of  offences against the ordinance during  the past two years  and the action taken inrespect  of them : Year.	Number of Seiaurei.	Xumbei&apos; of Ojfenceii.	Number of 0[)ences Compounded.......... 1929 .........	5,952 5,984	5,010 4,551	2,176 1,9(52  All cases of infringement  of  the  Tobacco  Ordinance are  dealtwith by the  Director  of  Customs  himself,  and he  is  personallyresponsible  for  compounding  such  of these  offences as seem tobe suitable for this action.  There is no doubt that the  Ordinanceis  properly  administered.                           (h) OLIVES.Grade  of oil.  There is  a  large  production of  olive oil in the  country.   As a rule the oil is of inferior quality, containing a large percentage ofacid.   This is due  to  the  primitive  nature  of  the machinery ofextraction,  to the  absence of cleanliness  in connexion  with theprocess,  and  to  the antiquated receptacles  in which the  oil isstored.  A reform in methods is a necessary  preliminary to a pureand sweet oil.Methods of culture.  Cultural practice is also  as a rule ignorant and primitive.   Theolives  are removed  from the trees by beating the branches withsticks.   Partly as a result of this practice the crop of the  following year is affected  so  much,  that  the olive  is looked  upon in thiscountry as  a  tree that  yields well one  year and very poorly thenext.  A  further drawback to successful culture is the ignorance of the  fellahin on the subject of  pruning the tree.  It may be saidwith truth that in large areas pruning is actuated not by any desireto  improve the tree or the crop, but by  the necessity to  obtainfirewood.Instruction in improved methods.  These are all  directions  in which  instruction  would have good results and this could  best  be  afforded  by demonstration.   Thesame absence of knowledge of pruning was remarked in the caseof  many  of the  Greek  refugees, and it was necessary to employtravelling  instructors to teach  the peasants how  to treat theirolive trees.  There is  no reason why such  a method should notbe  adopted in Palestine.   The  financial results  of the system in greece fully justified the expense.Extension of  area under cultivation.  There are wide spaces in the hill country  where the olive wouldgrow and where it would give a better return, even at the  presentlow- prices, than is  obtained  from cereal  crops.   It  would  be ofadvantage to the country if these areas were put under olives ratherthan cultivated  each year  with cereals.  It was suggested thatin  cases where cereal land  in the hill country is put down to trees,the tithe should be excused on that land  until  the trees  are inbearing.  This  seems  a fair suggestion, not only in  the  case ofolive groves but also where fruit trees are  planted, and not onlyin  the hills but  in the plains also.
                          (t) SESAME.Imports and Exports.  Everywhere a demand was made that the import duty on sesame,which had been removed in  1925 in order to help the Jewish OilFactory  &quot; Shemen &quot;  should be  re-imposed,  and  the  palestine government  has  agreed  to  the  re-imposition.    The  sesameposition  is  curious.   In  the year  1929  while  3,539 tons  wereexported at an average price of P 20.436  mils per ton; 3,470 tons were  imported  at a  price of  P 23.27S  mils  per ton.   The im-ported sesame  comes chiefly from  China  and  is generally said tobe an inferior seed to the Palestinian seed.Value as a summer crop.  The cultivation of sesame has a value apart altogether from itscrop.  It is a  summer crop, and requires a great deal of carefulweeding  and   cultivation.  It  is followed by the  winter cerealcrop, and the land is in a good condition to  receive the  seed  whenthe  sesame has been  pulled.  Sesame is therefore  a crop to en-courage, apart from its commercial value. Cultivation.   The Jewish colonies grow no  sesame,  as it  is a crop  demanding labour  both of women  and  of children  at time  of  harvest.   The crop is not reaped; each individual stalk is pulled by hand, labour of  a kind which the  Jewish  population  does not favour, in part perhaps because there are not yet  many  children of  an age to help in  the  harvest.  The value of the  yield at present prices  would not support  the expense  of hired labour.   The  fellah carries through the harvest with the help of his family.                            (j) BARLEY. Export  trade.   Before  the War considerable quantities of  Palestinian  barley were exported to the  United Kingdom  for malting  purposes.  In one year, 1908, the  export  from Gaza was 38,000  tons.  In 1913 it  amounted  18,400 tons.  Since  the  war  this  trade  has  not revived ; the maximum  amount exported to  the United Kingdom in any one year having been 1,600 tons. Possible reasons  for reduction of overseas trade.    One of the principal  reasons for the failure  of the trade to revive appears to  be that  prohibition  in  America has  released large quantities of Californian barley,  which  now finds it  way  to the United Kingdom.  There are, however,  other reasons.   The rain- fall of  the Gaza area is very  erratic,  and a crop  cannot  be  de-  pended on each year.   Probably the merchant prefers to deal where he is certain regularly to find the  amount he desires.   The Gaza  barley  contains  a  good deal of  extraneous matter.  A proposal  was made to purchase a cleansing plant on  behalf of the government -  ment,  as it  is  understood has  been done in the  Sudan,  and  to  demand  that all exported  grain  should be  cleaned  previous  to  export.  This scheme  fell through for financial reasons.    It is also  suggested  that the United Kingdom  demand for malt-  ing barley has  fallen  and that the reduced demand  is  met to a  larger  extent than formely by supplies produced locally.   Also that  the time of  shipment from Gaza, i.e., the end of June, is too late  for the market.  Further, the freight  from Gaza to  the  United  Kingdom amounts to  4s. 6d. a ton,  which compares  with  3s. 3d.  from  Canadian  ports,  and  3s. 6d. from New Orleans.   From New  York it is said to be Is. 9d.  Proposals for revival of the trade.     There seem to be a number  of reasons which explain the failure  of the barley trade with  Great Britain.  For  its revival, if that  revival is possible,  there are three necessary preliminaries.  First,  there must  be co-operation between the  growers and the merchants   in Palestine.   Next, grading  and  cleaning  arc  essential.   The
800875outlay on the necessary machinery is considerable and it is probablethat Government assistance is a condition of its purchase.   Finally,a reduction is required in the  freight charges from  Palestine tothe United Kingdom.  The last is probably the most difficult of thethree  conditions.              (fc) MINOR  AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.The Silkworm.  The Department of  Agriculture employs an expert in the breed-ing of the silkworm.  The budget allotment is so small that theactivities of the  Section are crippled.   This is the more unfortunatein  that there  is  a group of Arabs  who  are  familiar  with theculture of silk, and there is a definite demand in other quarters forinstruction, for  provision  of mulberry trees   and for  assistanceto breed silkworms.   This is a  demand which should be met, if at all possible.   Nothing of  any importance is possible with theexiguous sums provided in  the past, and it is of little use to pay an expert  300 a  year in order to  stimulate a demand,  unless thecreation  of the  demand is to be followed  by  some more  positive action.Present position of Silkworm Culture.  The culture  of  the silkworm  is suitable to the conditions  ofsmallholders  both  in  the Jewish settlements and in  the Arabvillages in many parts of the country, and this is a useful line ofdevelopment of a  minor  type,  where the family  income is smalland every additional  piastre makes  a difference.  Of the realityof the demand there is no doubt.  The  Arabs of Nablus, to whomreference is made above, were willing to provide  100 towards thecreation  of  a  small  factory if  the  Government would lend  afurther  100  to help  them.   A  further application received fromthe same town  in  the month of  May this year,  stated that 4,000men  were out of work in  the town and that, if a loan were givento  the applicant, he  would   start a  factory which would provide employment for at least a few of them.  In  some of the Jewishvillages in the Emek  the work has already been begun on a small scale.  In  general it may be said that the outlook for this small industryis not unfavourable. Its practice is  being taught in some of theGovernment  village schools.  An effort might well  be made  toextend  its  usefulness.Bees.  The production  of  honey is   another  activity for  the small-holder.  This industry is gradually  extending,  both among  theJews and among the Arabs, though the number  of hives kept by theJews is  probably the larger.   Export of honey  first commenced in  1925  when 9 tons were  despatched; in 1926  the amount ex-ported w&apos;as only 5 tons which sold for   325.   The export rose to11  tons in 1927, 17 tons in  1928 and 24 tons in  1929.   The valueof  the honey  exported in 1929 was P l,625  .6.1).Prevalence of Foul-brood.   Foul-brood first  broke out in Palestine  in 1924, when 400 hiveswere destroyed.  Since that  time there  have been minor outbreaksfrom time  to time, until  last year,  when there  were two seriousoutbreaks  in  Jewish  settlements, costing the  settlers hundreds ofhives.  If taken at once,  this disease is easily  controlled. Expansion of the  industry.   Palestine honey is said to  be as good as any in the  world.  Withthe extension of the orange  groves the production of  orange-flowerhoney has very largely increased; the same is true  of  eucalyptushoney. Wild thyme is becoming less  plentiful, as the land on which it flourished is being broken up, but  Palestine has a wealth of wild flowers and there  is  practically  no limit to the possible extension of  bee-keeping.   It is an occupation in  which the fellah rapidly becomes expert, and  which  is popular among  the Jewish settlers.
800870The Government  employs  an expert,  Mr.  Lipshitz,  who  is alsoin charge of the Acre Poultry Farm.   If the industry increases ata rapid rate, as it promises to do, it will be necessary to strengthen the personnel  of the Department which deals with it.                 (1) DAIRY AND STOCK  BREEDING.Contagious abortion.  In many of the Jewish settlements the basis  of settlement is the dairy.   A  large  number of bulls  and  cows were  imported  from holland, and, as has been recorded in another chapter, an epidemicof  contagious  abortion  has  broken out.    The  Chief VeterinaryOfficer states that there  are records of  the existence  of this diseasein 60 per cent, of the dairy herds,  but that it  is probable that allcases have not been reported and that about 80 per  cent, are infact infected.  The farms have been planned on  the assumption that each cow will provide 2,500 litres of milk  for sale, after  the neces-sary deduction for consumption by the family,  and  for  feeding ofthe calves.   The  price  of  milk has been  estimated  at  13 to 15mils.   The success of the farm naturally  depends on the accuracy of these two assumptions.  They have been vitiated by  the epidemicof contagious abortion, which reduces the yield of the dairy affectedfor obvious reasons,  and by the fall in the  price of milk, which wasselling in the  Emek  at  the  time  of this  enquiry at  10 mils netthe litre.Stall-feeding of dairy  stock.   Stall-feeding of stock and sale  of dairy  produce is probably themost  efficient  way  of using  land  in the  larger area  of the non-irrigable, or semi-irrigable, tracts.  In the agricultural  developmentof the country as a whole, the method  must take its place.  But itmust at  the same time  not be forgotten that the local market  fordairy7 produce is very strictly  limited, and that  unless  some way ofdisposal  of  the products is adopted,  differing  from the ordinarysale in the market, prices will  fall so that the area taken as a unit will prove to be insufficient  to support a  decent standard of life.  It  is therefore necessary to explore the possibility of creating a canning industry for dairy products; and of manufacturing cheesefor export.  In both of these directions keen competition  will be experienced, but unless the efforts  made are crowned with success,the dairy cannot be regarded  as the basis of settlement  except inan area comparatively small,  and the size of the holding will haveto be enlarged.                        CHAPTER IX.                      Palestinan Industry.  Census of Industries : Summaries. In the year 1928 the Depart-ment of Customs, Excise and Trade  undertook a  census of theIndustries of Palestine.  This census indicates that,  at that time,there were 3,505 factories, establishments and workshops, employ-ing in all 17,955 persons of whom 10,186 were wage-earners, thebalance of 7,769 including owners, clerks, technicians and, appar-ently,  contract  labour.   Graph No. 2  appended shows the distri-bution of pei-sons employed  by groups, age,  sex and occupation.  The average number of  persons employed was 5.1  per  establish-ment.   This is an indication of the very small scale of the industry which is carried on in  Palestine.  In the year  1927 the total expenditure of  these  establishments,including raw materials, salaries and wages, and fuel amounted to 2,975,401 an average of  849 per establishment.   (Vide GraphNo.  3.)  They  produced  in  all,  industrial  articles valued  at  atotal sum of  3,886,149, or   1,109 on  the average for each estab-lishment.   The  total capital  invested  was  3,514,886,  averagingjust  over  1,000 per establishment.  Graph No. 4, appended, shows the  racial distribution of the number of undertakings established,pre-war and post-war, and the capital invested.
  Food,  Drink,  Tobacco. The most  important group  was  thatdealing with Food, Drink and Tobacco.  In this group there were473 establishments, with  a capital of  1,319,912, with an expendi-ture of  1,664,083  and  production  valued at  2,036,272.   Thegroup  included  flour milling,  distillation  of  intoxicating  liquors,bakeries,  tobacco  and cigarette manufacture.  Chemicals and allied trades. The next  group in  importance isthat of Chemicals and Allied trades,  including olive oil presses,soap-making, etc.  It employed a total capital of   638,313.   Theexpenditure of the year 1927 was  506,409  and the production was worth   649,523.  Cement,  Brick, Stone  and Clay trades. The group  containing the Cement, Brick,  Stone and Clay  trades includes one of  thelargest and most important  individual factories in  the  country,the &quot; Nesher &quot; Cement Works.  In the group are  148  establish-ments.  The total capital invested was  517,106,  the expenditure 155,903, and the value of the out-turn  209,994.  Census  of Jewish  industry. The  Jewish  Agency has supplieda note on  Jewish industry  based on  a census of  that  industrycarried out  in the month  of March, 1930.   It  covered 2,274 urbanenterprises, which gave work to 9,362 persons, had an annual wagebill of  476,452  and used raw materials to a  value of  904,8S1.They produced finished articles to  a  value  of  1,635,462 and esti-mated their invested capital at  99S,904.  Thus the average numberof workers per establishment is 4.11, who are paid on the  averageabout  51 per  annum.  The raw  materials used average  398 perestablishment per annum.  Per establishment the  finished articlesaveraged   718  for the year, and the average  invested capital w7asabout  435^  In  the  case of these  purely Jewish industries  also  the  sameremarks apply.   The average  establishment is very small indeed.  The Memorandum divides the industries into three classes.  Inthe first class there are 1,725 enterprises, in each of which less than five persons are  employed.  In the second class,  employing  fromfive  to nine,  there  are 418 establishments.   The thud class arethose which provide occupation for 10  and over.  Of these Jewish enterprises, the most active period of foundationwas that  covering the  years  1920  to  1924.  That period saw the foundation of 50 of these larger enterprises, which now employ 1,515persons and have  a capital of  291,930.  The following period,1925 to 1929, was responsible for the creation of 56 enterprises, butthey  employ at  the  present time  only 1,204 persons and have  a capital of  1S8,489.  Principal industrial undertakings. Certain of the  industrial con-cerns are deserving of special  mention.  Of  all  the industries of Palestine  at the present  time, the twopotentially  most  important  are the  concessions  granted  to Mr.Butenberg  for  the production of  electric power from the  Jordan,now being  worked by the Palestine  Electric Corporation,  Ltd.,  a company  registered in London, and  to  Messrs.  Novomejsky  and major Tulloch for the exploitation of  the  salts of the  Dead Sea.This  concession is now being operated by  Palestine Potash,  Ltd.,also a company registered in London.  The harnessing of the Yarmuk and of the Jordan for the purposeof the first  concession is now complete, and it will be no long time before electric  current is  available  all over the North of  Palestine,both  for  power and  for  light.  Meanwhile all that is required isprovided from the Company&apos;s Power Houses in Tel-Aviv, Haifa and elsewhere.  Palestine Potash,  Ltd., is also approaching the stage at whichmanufacture will begin.  The  waters of the  Dead Sea are already being pumped up into the sand pans in which they will be evaporatedby the sun  and from which the  concentrated liquor  will be conveyed to the factory.     Nesher &quot;  cement works. A  large individual enterprise is the &quot; Nesher &quot; cement works at Haifa.  These works  are the propertyof the Portland Cement  Company  &quot;  Nesher,&quot; Ltd., a  companyregistered in London with  an authorised  capital  of  300,000, ofwhich  250,000 is paid up and which has issued  50,000 of firstmortgage debenture.
  The factory produces first-class cement.  It employs at the pre-sent time 390 wage-earners, of whom 250 are Jews, 10 Jewesses and130  Arabs.  The Company commenced business in 1925.  At  that time  theprotective duty on cement  was  200 mils (4s.) per ton.  In 1926 thetotal sales were 41,610 tons, of which 2,045 tons were exported.  In 1927 the  total sales rose  to 45,888 tons, of which 9,012 tons were exported.  In November  of that year  the protective duty was raised  to 600  mils (12s.) per metric  ton.  In 1928 total sales were  59,165 tons, of which 11,332 tons wereexported.   In December, 1928, the protective duty was again raised,from 600 to 850 mils  (12s. to  16s. 6d.) per metric ton.  In 1920, the  total sales  rose to 68,661  tons, of which 7,699 tons were exports.  In the sixth  annual  report for the year 1928 the Company&apos;s profitwas shown at  19,271, and a  dividend of 6 per  cent, tax free was declared.  The Company&apos;s cement is sold in Palestine at  P.2,700 mils (54s.)per  ton.  Last  year, 1929, cement was exported to Syria,  cyprus and Egypt, but the major portion went to Syria, where it was soldat  an average  price of 45s.  a  ton 9s. a ton  cheaper than thePalestine  price, notwithstanding the cost of transport to Syria.The Manager of the Company explained that building activity inPalestine  is irregular,  and that, in order  to  meet  any  suddendemand, it is necessary to  maintain production at a higher rate thanthat justified by the average local demand.  For this reason thereis a necessity to dispose of the  excess product so  manufactured even at a price that is not remunerative.   &quot; Nesher &quot;  cement: Effect  of protective tariff. It is clear thatthe  Company would have made a loss in place  of a profit had thewhole production been sold locally at the Syrian price.  Also thatthe  industry could not be  maintained were  it not for the protectivetariff.  The sole good  reason in favour of  the  tariff is that it  enables the  Company7 to employ 260 Jews and Jewesses and  130 Arabs who might otherwise have  been without  employment.  This argumentis not convincing to the purchaser in  Palestine,  who ultimately hasto pay the protective duty in the price of his cement.   Specially isthe argument  unconvincing to him when the profit created by the protective tariff for  which Palestine is  paying passes into the pockets of  an  English Company;  registered  in  London.   The ex- pediency  of increasing the protective tariff from 12s. to 16s.  6d.  a ton in view of the profits gained under the lower rate of  tariff is aiso frequently  canvassed, and with reason.   Eastern Oil  Industries,  Ltd. The &quot;  Shemen &quot;  Works, of the Eastern Oil Industries, Ltd., a Company registered in London, was founded in 1929 by Messrs. Paenson  and Wilbush.  The Company was known as the Palestine Oil Industry &quot; Shemen,&quot; Ltd., and it subsequently  transferred  the  business to  the present  proprietors. The works are situated at Haifa.  The factory manufactures olive, sesame and other oils from Palestinian products, and also cocoanuc oil from imported copra.   It makes toilet  and washing soaps  cooking- fats,  boiled  linseed,   oil-paints, perfumes  and  sweets  (such  as &quot; Halawa &quot;); from the residue, cattle cake is pressed.   The following statement shows the output,  the sales  and the maximum number of workers employed during the three years 1927, 1928, 1929 and the present year up to  1st May : -Year.	Output in Tuna.

In all  probability this is due  to thepresent position in the oil-stuffs industry.   Over-production of oii is
800379universal in Palestine, and the price of all oil has fallen very heavilyin consequence.  The labour employed  is entirely&quot; Jewish.  Nablus is the great centre of the olive-oil soap factories, and theexport of this country soap is the  most important of industrial ex-ports from Palestine.  The soap is manufactured in very primitivefashion, and maintains  its  market, chiefly in Egypt, owing to itswell-founded  reputation for  the  employment of  the   purest  in-gredients.  Animal  fats of every  kind  are avoided,  a  fact  whichrenders the soap pure in the eyes of the devout Moslem.   The total value of the  production of the Nablus factories is estimated at &quot;240,000 per  annum.   The proprietors  of the factories  and all theworkmen,  who number  about 200, are Arab.  Tobacco: Messrs. Kara-man, Dick  and Salti. The factory  em-ploying the most labour  is the tobacco factory  of Messrs. Karaman,Dick and Salti at Haifa. The labour force,  which is almost entirelyArab, numbers over 500.  The factory  manufactures cigarettes forthe local market,  and does a large increasing business.   A secondtobacco factory, that of Messrs. Maspero Freres,  Ltd.,  belongs toa company registered in London, and also  does an increasing busi-ness.  Its  personnel, which is chiefly Jewish, exceeds 100.  Grands  Moulins  de  Palestine. Haifa is also  the seat of theGrands Moulins de Palestine.  These Flour  Mills were  originallyfounded by Baron Edmond de Rothschild, and it is understood thathe still takes an interest in the venture.   They commenced working in 1923, and  the value  of  the  annual outturn has varied between 90,000  and  145,000.   They  cater  almost entirely  for  the home market, but occasionally export flour to  Syria.   The  same companyoperates also  a factory  for the production  of &quot; matzot,&quot; the un-lea.intervened Passovar cakes.  The annual output of this subsidiaryfactory is from 330  to 440 tons.  Of  the production  about one-half is consumed in Palestine and the other  half exported.  The two factories together employ slightly over  100  men  andwomen, all of them Jews.  Complaints are made that no protection is offered to this industry.It is said  that the  competition of imported flour is  such that the mills only produce  to half their full capacity.   It  is pointed outthat the import of foreign flour is actually greater  than  the amountof flour milled in the country.  The manager of the mills expressedthe hope that the import duty on flour might be increased and thaton  wheat reduced, as this would enable  the local mills to grind flourfrom foreign wheat for  the local market.   He pointed out that thelocal wheat does not lend itself to the  production of a white flour,such as is required  to make white bread.  All the local  wheats areof  the macaroni  variety,  and  produce what he described as a&quot; thick &quot; flour, yellowish in colour.  He also complained of the high cost of transport by the Palestine Railways.  He stated  that busi-ness was decreasing on account of competition, in meeting which the mills were at a disadvantage owing to the facts cited.   The  wine  industry. Wine is  manufactured  in the german colonies, by  the  Salesian Fathers at Beit  Jamal, and on a small scale in a number of ecclesiastical institutions.   But the most im-portant cellars are those attached to certain of the P.I.C.A. villages.The famous cellars of  Richon-le-Zion  and of Zichron  Jacob wereerected by Baron Edwond de Rothschild at his own expense, and hehas leased them since 1906 at a nominal rental to the &quot; Co-operative society of the Yinegrowers  of the  Cellars of Bichon-le-Zion andZichron Jacob, Ltd.&quot;  The  cellars at  Rehovoth and the distilleryat Gedera are the property of the Co-operative Society.  During thelast season the society has produced :         1,650,000- litres of dry wine.       1,035,000 litres of sweet wine.          56,000 litres of grape juice.         137,000 litres of spirit distilled from grapes and raisins.          70,000  litres  of  araki   manufactured   from  alcohol  or                    molasses.The ahoVe has a total  value of  80,000.  Of this total productionwine to the value of about  35,000 is exported.
  The Co-operative Society complains of the high rates of  Licencefees and Excise Duty, to which reference has been made earlier inthis report.  It also complains, as do other industries, of the high rate of railway freights on the Palestine  Railways.  In a note sub-mitted for purposes of this enquiry the society writes as follows : -      &quot; Generally the business was improving up to the period of tho dis-    turbances in August last. The hard economical conditions nearly every-    where in Europe and the Orient,  the fall  in quotations of wine abroad,    the doubled taxes and  fees  in Palestine,  the troubles and disturbances    in that country, the last ordor of the Palestine Government to restrict    the immigration and very dee]) disappointment provoked  amongst the    Jewish  Communities abroad,  have  necessarily affected  the  trade un-    favourably in the home market and  abroad.&quot;   Other  industries. The  smaller  and newer  industries,   as   a general  rule prefer Tel-Aviv to Haifa.   These  have in most cases been established by immigrants  who   have arrived in  Palestine since 1920.   A large number of them seem to provide employment for women rather than for men.   Printing. One of the industries which  is growing rapidly and which shows signs of extension is that of printing.   It is reported in  the  Memorandum  submitted  by the  Jewish Agency that  in Jewish  establishments alone 1,030 persons are employed.  At  the time of the census of  industries, the total  number employed was 992, of whom 18.4 per cent, were Arabs.   Assuming  the same percentage of Arabs to  be  employed to-day and  making  the con- sequent addition to the Jewish return,  the total  number employed in 1930 would be 1,230, an increase of over 24 per cent, in  the three years.   That this industry should prosper is natural.  It is engaged largely  in the printing and publication of Hebrew books, for which there is an increasing world demand.    Smaller  industries. Of   other   smaller   industries  the  more interesting are  those  for  the manufacture  of artificial  teeth,   of fancy leather goods, of textiles and fruit products.    As to the factory  of artificial teeth, the Memorandum  of the Jewish  Agency contains the following :       &quot;  No one  writing  on the  industrial  possibilities of  Palestine  could     by  any logical  course of reasoning arrive at the  apparently fantastic     conclusion that Palestine is a country particularly suited to  the manu-     facturo of artificial teeth.       &quot;  But a Jew who had immigrated to the United States some forty  or     fifty years ago had  become a most successful manufacturer of artificial     teeth, and on  coining to Palestine  he found that he could manufacture     them in Palostino successfully as  well.  They aro now being made  in     Tel-Aviv in a nice modern factory  which gives work to over GO  workers     and they are hoing exported, mainly to England  . .  . .&quot;    Fancy  Leather industry. The  leather  bag industry,  which  is  showing distinct signs  of progress, was introduced by some  Polish  Jews, who had  technical knowledge of the leather industry.  The  &quot; Zetge &quot; Company now makes  leather hand-bags in Tel-Aviv and  exports them  to Egypt and  elsewhere.  The  Company  started  in  1926 with one  workman.   It now employs 65 persons altogether.  The Company  made a  request  that  leather  should be  considered  as a raw material and should  be admitted  free  of  import  duty.  There  is a  protective duty of 15  per cent, ad  valorem on  Ready  Fancy  leather  goods,  and the  import duty on expensive  light  leather has been reduced by 50  per cent.   These measures appear  to have  assisted  the  industry considerably,  and  its  very  success  tends to show  that conditions of  competition  are not so severe  as  materially to affect the  Company.    Textile industry. Of textile  factories,  according to the  Census  of Jewish industries, there are 40, of which 12 employ  more than  10  persons apiece.  Among  these there is  one which  is  producing  stockings on a  considerable  scale.  The exports of Stockings and  Hose have  increased  from a value of   430 in 1925 to . 17,532  in  1928 and  18,919 in  1929.  Of this sum  the  major part is due to  the &quot;  Lodzia  &quot; Stocking Factory.  Its history  is interesting, and  is thus described in the Memorandum of the Jewish Agency : -      &quot; .  .  . . Somo time ago some  people  came from  Poland  and started      manufacturing these  articles. They had somo small experience of tho      businoss but not sufficient,  and the factory proved a failure  in their      hands.  It was taken over  by  another Jewish  immigrant  who all  his      life (in Russia) had  been doing this particular business; ho  also had.      sufficient means and  ho made tho factory into success,&quot;
The stocking produced is a very cheap article and evidently suppliesa considerable demand both locally and in adjoining countries.  Fruit-juice and fruit &quot;products. An industry which,  as  yet ofsmall proportions,  may  ultimately  prove of great importance to palestine is Fruit-Juice and Fruit Products.  The &quot; Assis &quot; Com-rpany manufactures  fruit-juice of excellent  quality from oranges.There is  a considerable  quantity  of oranges  which  for  various reasons are not  fit for export though  perfectly  sound  fruit.   Wi.hthe increasing production of the orange the number of these unexpired-portable oranges will increase rapidly, and the  &quot; Assis &quot; company is  one of  the agencies for profitable  disposal of  this fruit.  It isdesirable that efforts should be made  to popularise the products ofthis and of similar concerns, in the interests of  the orange-growers.The produce of  this factory much resembles that of a well-knownAustralian  factory.                 THE DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRY.  Industry in the past. Views of very differing nature are expressedin different quarters both in regard to the expansion of industry inPalestine in the  past and as to its prospects in the future.  The  remarkable  feature  of  the  past  is  the rapid  increaseof  the  small industry  and   the  comparatively  stationary posi-tion  of the large.    It  is  clear  that  the  &quot; Nesher &quot; CementFactory is  dependent on protection not only  for its  profits,  butfor its  existence.  It could  not compete with imported cement,were the protective tariff  withdrawn.  The withdrawal of the dutyon  imported oilseeds appeared  to be a necessity to the  success ofthe  &quot; Shemen &quot; oil factory.   The Cellars of Kichon-Le-Zion  andZichron-Jacob owe  their  very  exis.ence,  not to  economic  action,but  to the  liberality and interest of Baron Edmond de Rothschild.The industry continues to prosper by reason of the protective duties on  imported wines and spirits.  The textile trade benefits  by  theimport  of its raw materials free of  duty  and by a 12 per cent, ad valorem tax on  similar goods imported into the country.  In fact,large industry in Palestine appears to depend  on  manipulation ofthe  tariff.   The  rest of the  population is taxed in order that  the proprietors of these industrial concerns may  be  in a position to  paythe wages of their labourers and to make a profit for themselves.  Small industries.-The number of very small industries is mostsurprising.  In  the Memorandum submitted by the Jewish Agencyit  is s:ated that in  the Colonies and Villages  there  are over  400enterprises in which 700  persons are engaged;  i.e., on the averageless than two persons per enterprise.  It is difficult to imagine suchan  establishment as being more than an instance of home industry.  Number  of persons employed. The  figures of the  IndustrialCensus of 1928  are very illuminating on this point  of  the smallworkshop.  In  31.4 per cent,  of the establishments no paid  labour at all was  employed, in 20.1 per cent, one wage-earner, in 26.2 percent, two or three, in 13.3 per cent,  four or five.   That is  to  say,that of the whole of  the industrial establishments in  Palestine atthat time 91 per cent, employed five wage-earners or less.   At theother end  of the scale twelve  establishments,  or 0.3 per cent, ofthe whole, employed over 100 wage-earners,  fifteen, or  0.4  percent., employed between 50  and 100.  The number of establish-ments employing over 50 wage-earners was therefore twenty-sevenin  the  whole of Palestine, and they formed 0.7 per  cent,  of thetotal of industrial concerns.   Future development of industry:  Jewish. The question.of thefuture  development of industry in Palestine is discussed at con-siderable length in the Memorandum of the Jewish Agency to which reference has been already made.  The Memorandum considers  that &quot; from the point of view of Industry the whole talk of the absorptive capacity of the country is out of place and  should be disposed ofonce and for all.&quot;  The aim  of Jewish  industry is  not  &quot; to cater for  the wants of 600,000 Arabs, three-quarters of whom are poorpeasants   .   .   .  .  it is to  the Jewish Community itself  and to Export that Jewish industry  looks in the first place.  It is quiteincorrect  to believe  that Jewish Immigration is  dependent&apos; on  a market being already available; it is before all things  Jewish immi- gration that  creates  the home market  and conquers the  foreign
market  .   .   .   .&quot;  What really defines the possibilities of futureJewish Industry in  Palestine is a factor which has not yet receivedsufficient  attention  and which  indeed is not yet to its full  extentknown even to the Jews themselves :  it is the human factor.  The fundamental question is notWhere are we going to take the power?  norWhat  raw materials are available?  not  even although it is an important question,What  are the best markets?  The fundamental question is :  Are  there Jews, and how many ofthem  are there, who are prepared to  immigrate  into  Palestine ifsufficiently  encouraged, or at least not discouraged, and who will bring with them sufficient capital and adequate business experience,but  preferably  a sufficient  knowledge  of a particular  industry  inorder  to set up  industries  which may,  each in  its own line, com-pete with similar industries; and  are  there other  Jews  who  areprepared  to immigrate into Palestine to supply  the  skilled and  im-skilled labour required?     &quot; If such Jews  do  not exist at all  or are not available in  any large    numbers then the present  investigation with respect to the possibility    of  an  industrial  immigration  as distinct  from an  agricultural immi-    gration becomes obviously  purposeless.  The problem will then have been    solved by its  non-existence. It  is  the  contention of the  Zionists that    such Jews do  exist and that they are available in large numbers, that    they  clamour for admittance  and that in settling  in Palestine they    will not  drive (Y  away) the Arab population  that it holds at present.&quot;  Possibilities of an extension of industry. The Memorandum goes on  to point  out certain j^romising  directions  in which there isscope  for an extension of industry.  It  mentions  the Clothing indus-try as a specifically Jewish industry  all over the world, it suggeststhat there  is no reason why Palestine should  not  rival Egypt asa centre  of the Tobacco industry, it points out that the Jewrs ofPoland play  an important part in the Textile industry.   It goes on to  say that  there  are prospects  in  Preserved Fruit and Vege-tables, it refers to the success of the Printing industry, it anticipatesgreat  development of the  Chemical industry as  the  result of theDead  Sea concession.   It then dwells upon the importance  of  the Tourist industry withall  the  subsidiary  occupations  accessory  thereto.   Finally,  afterpointing  out  the opportunities and  the demands  in the Buildingindustry, the Memorandum  closes by relying on the success of thepast as  an indication  of the possibilities  of the future, and insist-ing that such part of Jewish immigration ns is meant to be absorbed by  industry  should not be limited  by any imaginary  absorptive power of the country.     &quot;  . . . . The absorptive capacity of the country, from the point of  view     of industry,  is dependent only on the willingness and ability of Jewish     capitalists to start  industries  which  they may understand and  the pro-     ducts of which they can market, and of Jewish labour to come in and     work.&quot;   Industrial  enterprises before  the War and- subsequent increase.  Of  existing industrial establishments 1,236, with a total capital  in excess of one  million pounds  were in existence before the War. Since the  War therefore  the number of  establishments had in- creased up to  the date of the Industrial Census  by 2,269 or 183 per cent, and the capital by two and a half million pounds, or 250 per cent.  This is  a very material  increase  and  it is almost  entirely due to the importation of Jewish capital and the immigration  of a Jewish  population.   Future of Palestinian industry. It  is a difficult thing to  forecast the future of industry in  a country, and not easier in the case  of Palestine than in that of  others.   In fact it  is more difficult,  as the future development will not depend, as  is ordinarily the case, on the economic capacity of the country,  but on a  stimulus which  may be  called artificial,, without misuse  of that word.
8008S3  The Director of the Department of Customs,  Excise and Tradewrote  as  follows on  this  subject :      &quot;  .... It is doubtful whether some of the larger concerns .... would    be  able to stand without outside help; but there  are certainly several    small factories which are making a profit and show every  prospect of    success and  a  striking  example  of  this  is  the  Artificial Tooth    Factory ....     &quot; It would appear that for a factory to have any  real ehauco of    ultimate success it must look to the  markets of Egypt ami Syria to  take    the larger proportion of its  manufactures,  and not  to the  Palestine    market; it is therefore those factories which are manufacturing  articles    likely to find a  ready sale in those countries which would seem to  have    the most prospect of success and to  bo worthy of Government assistance    in  the way of exemptions for  raw material.     &quot; It cannot be said that there are any prospects of the heavy indus-    tries enumerated above  requiring any fresh labour, but certain addi-    tional  labour might be required as some of the smaller factories progress.    Probably  at  least  50 per cent,  of such  additional  labour would  be    female ....     &quot; A  recent examination of the exports of manufactures from Palestine    does not show that rapid expansion which is desired, even allowing for    the set-back owing to the disturbances in August, 1929.  On the other    hand, there is progress, although slow, and although many of the weaker    concerns must fail, there are  reasonable  hopes of progress  for  certain    industries in Palestine but  not  on anything  like the  scale  that  was    at  one time anticipated.   In fact it would seem probable that  it will be    a matter of many years before Palestine is likely to be able to claim to    be  an  industrial as well as an  agricultural country.&quot;  Immigration  as a  solution  of industrial problems. There is  incertain quarters an optimism  with regard  to  the industrial possi-bilities in Palestine which is founded chiefly on hope and possibly on conviction.   It  has been  quite seriously argued  that  the difficultyof disposal of an excess  of dairy produce could be solved by  the arrival of immigrants  in  sufficient  numbers.   A similar argumenthas been used with regard to housing.   The more  immigrants  arrive,the more employment there will  be for those whose  occupation itis to build houses.  From such a point of view, it is  true  that  theintroduction of capital and labour and the erection of textile millson  a large scale in Haifa and Tel-Aviv would bring  prosperity tothe country  until the capital was expended.   But it is the  duty ofthe Government to look further than the immediate  present.  there seems  no reason why a Textile industry on the grand scale  shouldbe  a success in Palestine,  with labour paid  at  the rates  fixed bythe  General Federation  of Jewish  Labour, while  the  mills  of japan and of Bombay, equipped with the most modern machinery,and employing  the cheapest of labour, are unable to  find sufficientmarkets for their goods.   From the  point of view  of those whoseardent desire it is to import Jews from Poland and Russia and the yemen into  Palestine in large  numbers, and whose  object is  gainedwhen  the immigrant has arrived in Palestine, it may be sufficientthat temporary  employment  is assured.   But the  Government is responsible  not  only for the  present,  while the imported  capitalis supporting the new population, but for the future, when spendingof the imported capital will be at  an end and the immigrant willhave to  live on employment, which will then be dependent  on thesuccess of the mill in  competition with the mills of the world.  Progress of industry. An examination  of  the figures  of exportsdue to the existing  industries does not  support the view  that theIndustry of Palestine is  making very rapid  progress.   Mr. Gold-water has written for  the Palestine Corporation Ltd.  a most inter-esting and important general report on Palestine for the  year 1929.At  the end of that review he gives  the  figures of  export  of theprinciple products of industry, for the years since 1925.  The totalsof those  figures for the past three years are the following :                                                                 1927      ...     ...............     426,983     1928      .........     .........     426,160     1929      .........     .........     4S2.826In  the first  two of the  three years,  soap,  an  ancient  indigenousindustry, accounted  for more than  half the exports.  Industries likely to succeed. There are industries for which thereis every  hope of success in Palestine.  There is  no  reason, as is pointed out  in the Memorandum, why the Tobacco industry shouldnot become  increasingly  important.   It  is  exceedingly  desirable
800884that a  Canning industry  should prove  a success  if  the  Dairyindustry and the Fruit industry are to expand in the future.  Everyeffort should be made to extend the market for and the productionof fruit-juice.  The Printing industry will doubtless develop  natur-ally into an important branch of the Industry of Palestine.  If theDead Sea  concession proves to be a successful venture, it  is im-possible  to forecast the magnitude to which the Chemical industryarising  therefrom may expand.   The Tourist industry  (if  it canlegitimately  be  so designated)  will doubtless continue to grow andto afford employment  for  a greater number of persons  each year.All of  these  are perfectly  natural developments.  Danger of unemployment. It would be a bad,  and might prove a fatal  policy,  to attract  large capital in order  to start doubtfulindustries in Palestine, with the object of justifying an increase inthe number of immigrants.  The  Memorandum spends much effort in an attempt to establish that the  year  of &apos;* so-called &quot; crisis in1926 was not in fact a year of crisis at all.  It is  a question, some-what academic, of the   meaning  to  be  attached  to  the  word&quot; crisis &quot;.     In that  year the  provision  of  relief  works for theJewish  immigrants  who  could  not otherwise obtain  a  living was actually  necessary.  Whether or not that should be  designated a crisis is  immaterial.  It was an episode of which  no Governmentwould  willingly contemplate  the recurrence.   The  importation oflarge numbers  of immigrants to be  employed on  new  industries of  extensive  character whose  economic  success  is quite proble-matical, might  well cause a crisis compared with which the &quot; so-called &quot;  crisis of 1926  would indeed seem  unimportant.  Concentration on  industries shoiuing vitality. The correct prin-ciple governing the  problem  is to concentrate on  those  industries which already show signs of vitality and  success, and  to attemptto create those, such as are detailed in the Memorandum  and above in this report, whose effect will be to increase the exports of  rnanu-factured goods and to  employ as raw material Palestinian products of which it is impossible otherwise to dispose.  Arab industries. There exist certain indigenous Arab industriesbesides that  of soap,  to  which reference has been made earlier.There is a Tanning industry, there  is a Pottery  industry, there isa Weaving industry and  a Carpet-making  industry.  All of theueare on a very small  scale.  In any attempt to develop the country,the claims of Arab industry should not be overlooked.  There is inexistence a  Society  of a semi-charitable nature which is designedto encourage and stimulate the indigenous  industries.  It will findits  place in  any general  scheme of development.  Mineral deposits. The mineral resources of Palestine  have been examined  by the Government  Geologist,  who  has  published an interesting report.*  There is no doubt that phosphatic rock exists  * &quot; Thi) Mineral Resources of Palestine and Traus-Jordania,&quot; by G. S. Blake,Jerusalem, 1930.in very large quantities, both  in Palestine and in Trans-Jordania,and that  some of it  is of good marketable quality.  Transport isan outstanding difficulty.   Bitumen has also been found, and thereare oil-shales in  certain tracts.  Recently  an  important deposit ofsulphur is said to have been  discovered in the Gaza area,  and asyndicate formed to  work it.   Copper is believed  to exist  in  theAkabah peninsula.   Though nothing very definite has so far been done, the chances of mineral development of the country  exist, and this possibility should not be overlooked.
                        CHAPTER X.                         Immigration.  Early liistory. The figures of Immigration since  1st November,1922,  are  included  in Appendix  22,  and  of  Emigration  inAppendix 23.  Eor  the  purposes  of  this  report it  is unnecessary  to  discussthe early history  of  immigration into Palestine.    The originalImmigration  Ordinance came into force in 1920,  under  whichthe Zionist Organization were authorized to introduce into thecountry 10,500  immigrants  per  annum, on condition  that they accepted responsibility for their maintenance for one year.    Thissystem  was not found to  be  a success, and in  May,  1921, im-migration  was  suspended   until  revised  conditions  could  be imposed.  Pronouncement  of  3rd  June,  1921. Those  conditions  were announced  in a  public pronouncement by the High Commissioneron 3rd June of that year.  The   following  categories   of  immigrants were  permitted  inaccordance with the  pronouncement :        (a) Travellers  who did not  intend to remain in  Palestine    for more than  three months.       (b) Persons of independent  means who  intended to  reside    permanently in Palestine,       (c) Members of professions who  intended  to  follow their    calling,       (d)  Wives,  children  and other  dependents of persons  re-    sident  in Palestine,       (e) Persons  with definite prospects  of  employment  with    specified employers,       (/)  Persons of  religious occupation,  who could  show that    they had means of maintenance in Palestine,       (g) Returning  residents.  It was found by  experience that these  regulations  were not altogether  satisfactory; and  in September.  1924, a series of new orders   were  issued  under  the  form of Regulations  under the immigration  Ordinance.  Immigration Ordinance, 1925. In  the year 1925  the existingOrdinance   was  repealed  and  replaced  by   the ImmigrationOrdinance  of  that  year, which, as amended in  192S,  is  still inforce.    Regulations   under   the   Ordinance   were   issued  inSeptember, 1925.    These  again  have  been supplemented  in  by regulations dated  1st  July,  1926,  and  amended  by regulations of 1st December,  1927.   This  Ordinance  and these regulationsare the legal  authority which govern immigration  into palestine to-day.  Categories  of  immigrants. Immigrants into Palestine fall into one of the following nine categories :        A. (i) Persons  in possession  of   1,000 and upwards, and    their families.       A. (ii)  Professional  men  in   possession  of    500  and    upwards.       A. (iii) Skilled artisans in possession of   250 and upwards.       A. (iv)  Persons enjoying an  assured income  of  4  per    month.       B. (i) Orphans  destined for institutions  in Palestine.       B. (ii)  Men  and women of religious  occupation,  whose     maintenance is assured,  and  their families.       B.  (iii)  Students, whose maintenance is assured.       C. Working men and women and their families.       D. Dependent relatives of residents in  Palestine, who  are     in  a position  to  maintain them.   Class C  is intended  to include all who seek or accept employ-ment, with the exception  of those admitted under A  (ii) or (hi).It is also the intention not to admit in Class A (iv), B  (ii)  or (iii)and D, any  persons who will seek employment or go  into trade.   It  has been found by experience that the regulations are  not entirely effective in  this respect.    Immigrants of Classes  D and
A (iv) are found to engage in  trade.   Formerly immigrants underClass D sought  employment in many cases and still do so.    those under B  (iii) also occasionally do so.   Unrecorded  immigration. In  addition to  the persons  of  the categories provided  for  those  who  desire to settle in  Palestine,&apos;alarge number of persons, amounting to some thousands each year,secure admission to the country in  the guise of travellers.   Onlya  minority come under  notice and, of these, those qualified areregistered as immigrants under their respective categories.   Thoseof the working  class and under 35 years of age are counted  againstthe  Labour Immigration  Schedule.   The  rest  are  refused per-mission to remain in Palestine,  but it is  exceedingly difficult tosecure their departure, and a  large number remain in  the country.In addition a number of persons, not inappreciable, secure admis-sion by evading such controls as  exist on the frontiers.   No  effective  control  of  immigration  into  Palestine is  possibleunless steps are taken to deal with  these two classes of irregularentrants.   Procedure in  regard  to the issue of  Immigration  Certificates. With reference to the  Labour  Schedule on which  the  numberof immigrants  under Class C is based, the  Commission  on  thePalestine  Disturbances   wrote  on  pp.  104  and  105  of theirreport : -    &quot;  .... We were informed  by the Chief Immigration Officer that in    the allocation to individuals  of the certificates which  are supplied in    blank  to the General Federation of Jewish Labour, it is the  practice    of  that body to have regard to the political creed of the several possible    immigrants rather than to their  particular qualifications for admission    to  Palestine.  It is clearly the duty of the responsible Jewish authorities    to  select for admission to Palestine those of the prospective immigrants    who are best  qualified on personal grounds to assist in the establishment    of  a Jewish National Home in that country; that political creed should    be a  deciding factor in  the  choice  between applicants is open to the    strongest exception.&quot;   This statement  of  the  Commission has  been disputed  by  the zionist Agency, who refer to Mr. Snell&apos;s Reservations at  p. 175,wiiere he describes the actual procedure.   From  enquiries made from  the Executive  of the Jewish Agency  it  appears  that theregular practice is that described by Mr. Snell.   The Influence of the  General Federation of Jeioish  Labour overimmigrants and immigration. There is nevertheless  a  very close connection between the   General  Federation of Jewish  Labourand the immigrant, even  before he leaves the country whence hecomes.   In each  of the countries whence immigrants  come, there existsan organization for preliminary training in  agricultural practice.Close to  Warsaw,  for  example,  there  is a  large farm on whichthe Chalutzim, the Pioneers, obtain agricultural training  and in-struction.   In Galicia  they become  paid  agricultural labourers.Similar arrangements exist in Germany  and in France.    To eachOf these  centres of training, the  General  Federation  of  JewishLabour  has deputed instructors.    At the time of writing twentyof these  teachers,  almost all of whom are  so  deputed,  are  em^ployed.    These men,  though   representatives  of   the  Genera^Federation, receive  from  that Federation only  the  cost  of their?journey.    Their expenses in the country in  which they work are met  either by  their own earnings  or by funds provided by someZionist  Organization.   The actual   choice of  the  individual  immigrant  is, it  is true,made by the Committee to which reference is made by Mr. Snell in his note of Reservations.    It is at  the  same time clear  that all  the  immigrants who  come  in  on  the Labour Schedule are trained  by teachers  deputed  by  the  General  Federation  before they  are so chosen.    The  large majority  become  members  of the Federation immediately  on arrival.    The  official in  charge of the Hostel  in which the immigrants reside  on their arrival  atJaffa  is   himself  a member  of the  Executive  of  the&apos; General Federation of Jewish Labour, and as the Jewish Agency point out in a Memorandum which they have submitted in connection withthis  enquiry, the Immigration Department of the Jewish  Agency. provides  for the registration of all arriving immigrants as members
soos87of the Kupat-Cholin  (the Sick Fund  of the General Federationof Jewish Labour).  It  is  therefore somewhat  disingenuous  to  suggest  that  theGeneral  Federation  of Jewish Labour  is  unconnected  with  the choice of  the  individual  immigrant.    In  the great  majority ofcases the immigrant would have no chance of a permit,  unless he were persona  grata  to the  Labour authorities.  The following  is an extract  from the  Memorandum  submittedto the &quot; Palestine Commission of Enquiry &quot;  (i.e., the Commis-sion on the Disturbances  of August, 1929) by the General Federa-tion  of Jewish  Labour.    After  describing  its  many  and  im-portant activities  in Palestine, it  says :     &quot;  .... The Federation exercises a  decisive influence upon  Zionist    youth  in the  Diaspora,  anxious to bring  about  the fulfilment  of  the    Zionist ideal by their own  labour. Practically all  over  Europe there    exist  1 Hehahiz &apos; (the Pioneer)  organizations  training  Jewish boys  and    girls  in agriculture  and industry  for the purpose  of taking  a direct    part in the upbuilding of Palestine. These organizations, which supply    the bulk of the human material for the Zionist work in Palestine  that    is based on manual labour, are organically linked with the  Histadruth    (i.e. the General Federation) which controls their educational work.    An immigrant  Halutz automatically becomes a member of the  Histadruth    upon  his arrival in Palestine . . . .&quot;  A  further  quotation bearing on this point  is  the  following,extracted from a  communication  from Agudath  Israel,  the bodyof orthodox Jews :      &quot;  .... AVe do not think that there is  any ground for the  anxiety    expressed in the Report  of the  Shaw Commission  regarding  the  alleged    party  influence  on  the  distribution of certificates, but the  attitude    towards immigrants of the religious class has been  very unsatisfactory    up to the  present.   In  Poland, the chief source of  Palestine  Jewish    immigration where orthodox Jewry,  i.e.  Agudath-Israel, holds  a  very    important position, young men of this class  were refused immigration    certificates, in spite  of the fact that such religious people have a  still    greater longing for Palestine owing to the holiness  of the land  and to    the respective religious bidding . . . .&quot;  From  the  above  it  is evident  that  though the  detailed factsalleged before  the Commission may not have been exact, the state-ment  made  did  in  essence convey a general  description  of  theposition,  which  is not by any means far from  accurate.  Preparation  of  Labour Immigration  Schedules. The prepara-tion of the Labour Immigration Schedules  is governed by Regnla-tion 8  made  under  the  Immigration  Ordinance.   Twice in eachyear the  Jewish Agency  presents a  memorandum giving  thenumber  of men and women immigrants  whom they  consider  willbe  needed for new  employment  during  the  period under review,and exposing the reasons in detail in  the light of information re-ceived also from  other sources, as, for instance, the Director ofPublic  Works,  the  General Manager of the  Palestine  railway-ays,the  principal employers of labour, the General Federation of  JewishLabour.   Information which has come to officers of the   Immi-gration section in the course of their  regular work and  investiga-tions is also taken into consideration.   The  information  available from all sources  is  then  tabulatedin the following form :        A.  Jewish Unemployed.       B.  Jews  whose employment will cease during the  half year.       C.  Total.       D. Additional Jewish labour required by  larger  employers     and  public  bodies.       E. Estimated requirements of small  employers.       F.  Deserve.       G. Total.   Assuming that  G exceeds C, the difference  is recommended tothe High Commissioner  as the figure for  the Schedule and  thisrecommendation is considered by him  in Executive Council.   The Deserve  to which reference is  made is a number  of  300placed at the disposal of the  Chief Immigration Officer to meet special  cases  which   may  occur  during  the  six  months,   as  for instance  applications  for  particular skilled men wanted by  an  ein- ployer for his work, the  need  having arisen after the preparationof the Schedule.  This reserve  is authorised by Regulation 9 (1).
800888  Procedure  adopted after schedule approved by  High Commis-sioner. A schedule having been approved  by the High Commis-sioner,  the necessary number  of  immigration certificates is pre-pared.  Of these  the  required number is reserved  for  private employers in Palestine  whose applications have been approved and whose candidates are qualified for  the Schedule.  Certificates arealso reserved for working  men and women within the ages laiddown, who are found during  the  Schedule period to be in Pales-tine without  permission.   The remainder  of  the  certificates  are placed  at  the  disposal of the  Jewish Agency, which is  expectedtherefrom to provide to all Jewish young men and women  (except-ing  wives) of  the  working class  on  whose behalf  application  ismade by  relatives for immigration certificates during the half year.   Authorization  of Visas. The Jewish Agency is asked  to indi-cate where the respective visas will be claimed and in reply a listis sent  in the following form :-                                            Men.      Women.     Warsaw  (say)............     500         300     Berlin  ...............     200         100                                                         etc., etc.The original certificates are then  sent in blank  to  the Agency  for distribution  to  its  representatives  in  the towns concerned,  dupli-cates being despatched to the  British Passport or consular officersin the  same towns.   Instructions are  conveyed  to Passport  Officers intimating thatvisas may be granted to persons who fulfil the conditions laid, down,and who are nominated by the Jewish Agency representative, andthat those who are married  may obtain visas  at the same timefor  their  wives  and minor children.  Visas should in no circumstances- stances be granted  to men and women to whom  there  is  known political  or medical objection,&quot; or objection on account of character.   Failure of  the system. -The  system described  above fails  to work well in certain particulars.   In many cases persons have been admitted who,  if the  facts had  all been known should  not have received  visas.   A  large  number of these  cases have  been  ex- amined.    A  considerable  number concern Yemenite Jews  who immigrate from Aden.  The  following  cases  all concern  immigra- tion certificates which have been used during the last three months, and were issued  by the  representatives of the Jewish Agency at Aden :          (i) A man aged 30 with a  wife aged 20  and a son aged  12.      This would imply  that  the  son was born when his  mother      was eight years old.        (ii) A man aged 28 with a wife  aged IS and  their son aged      12.  In this  case the mother must have  been  six  years  old      when the son was born.        (iii)  A man aged 23 with  a wife aged 10 and their daughter      aged 5.         (iv)  A man aged 35 with a wife aged 24 and their daughter      aged 15.         (v) A man aged 35 with his wife aged 25 and their daughter      aged 16.         (vi) A man aged 35 with his wife aged 26 a&quot;nd their son aged      15.         (vii)  A  man aged 30 with a wife aged 22 and a son aged 12.     The  Immigration Officer writes with reference to cases  such as   these :       &quot; . ... It would appear that the practice is growing up in  Aden it      is not unknown elsewhere of attaching wives and families to persons      entitled to immigration certificates so that by this  means the passport      control of this Government  may be evaded . .  . .&quot;     The  following  is the  copy of a  letter dated  14th April, 1930,   from an immigrant who has been in the country some years :        &quot;...  . . &quot;. My wife arrived in  Palestine on 26th November, 1925, together      with (A.B.) as  the latter&apos;s  wife.  She was unable to arrive as my wife      because I,  myself, entered as a traveller and was not yet in possession      of a permission to remain in  the  country.  Since my wife strongly-      wished  to join me and meanwhile the wife of  (A.13.) became ill (he was;      in possession of a permission to enter Palestine  on her behalf) my wife      and our son .... arrived on his passport.
      &quot; (A.B.)  left the country  approximately in  May, 1926, for Canada    via Jaffa Paris.  I am unaware of the exact date of his departure.                           Respectfully,                               Y.Z.     Note. I  cannot recollect whether the first name of Mr. (B) was (A)    or (C).&quot;  The above  illustrates  two  typical  cases of irregularity.  the writer had entered as a Traveller and remained without permission.The wife was introduced on an immigration certificate by fraud.  Weakness of, and responsibility under the present system. Thesecond case and the  cases of the Yemenites discussed  earlier  indi-cate a weakness in the present system.  The authority responsiblefor  the issue  of the  certificates is the local representative of theJewish Agency.  He is also responsible for seeing that the person who actually  travels, is the  person for whom  the certificate was issued.   It is true that the Yemenite cases should have been de-tected by the  officer who dealt with the visa.  The facts were notconcealed.   They  were actually stated on the passport.  But the primary  responsibility  rests with the  local agent of  the jewish agency.  Selection of immigrants abroad. In the Memorandum  of theJewish Agency on Immigration, the subject of the selection of theemigrants abroad and of the  care  with which they are chosen and assisted  till their  arrival at their destination is described  in full.The following is a quotation  from that Memorandum :     &quot; . .  . . The selection of  the  immigrants for Palestine is the  first and    paramount  responsibility  of the Palestine Offices abroad,  which repre-    sent all the Zionist circles interested in the up-building of  Palestine.    These Offices  act  on the periodical instructions  of the Immigration    Department of the  Jewish Agency, which in turn are given after con-    sultation with the Immigration Board.&quot;It  is clear therefore that  the Jewish  Agency accepts the fullestresponsibility  for these cases of irregularity.   That fact, however,does  not render it  any the  easier  to rectify matters, when the immigrant has arrived in  Palestine.  Government  control  abroad. It is  difficult  for the  PassportOfficer or  for the  Consular  Officer  to  examine all  these  casesminutely.  At the  same  time it is  most important that  theyshould be  so examined, both in order to prevent persons beingadmitted to Palestine who have  no right to enter, and to protect the country from characters who may  be undesirable.   The Immi-gration Department used to have its own representative at Warsawto  deal  with  immigration  from that centre.   The post was  abol-ished for reasons of economy.  It is desirable  that the post shouldbe  reconstituted.  It is also desirable  that there  should be officersrepresenting the Immigration Department in all the centres whenceimmigration is on a large  scale.&apos;  Only thus will  it be possible toensure against both irregularities in connection with the certificatesand against the immigration of undesirables.  Travellers remaining in  Palestine.-The case of the traveller whoenters with permission to  remain for a limited time and then  stayson  without  sanction  to  do  so,  is  exceedingly  common.   It  is calculated  that  the number of such cases were 2,400  in the year ending June  30th, 1928, 3,400 in the following year and 2,000 inthat  ending  on June 30th, 1930, that  is to say, that in  the last three  years 7,800 persons  stayed  in Palestine without permission.   Evasion  of the frontier control. Another serious feature of immigration is the number of persons who evade  the  frontier con-trol and enter Palestine  without formality of  any  kind.   It  is exceedingly difficult to maintain any effective control of the variousfrontiers of Palestine.  At the present time such control as existsis  carried  out at  police posts on  the  roads.   The immigrant who wishes to evade the  control naturally  leaves the road before reach-ing the  frontier and takes to the footpaths over  the Hills.   Mr. Dowbiggin, in his recent enquiry into the police  of Palestine,remarked  on the fact that this  duty  of controlling&apos; immigrants isnot a duty  which  the police should  be  called upon to  perform.It  is eminently a duty for the Immigration Department, and it isunderstood that  the  Palestine Government is about to replace thePolice who are employed on  this duty  by officials of  that Depart-ment.
  Discouragement  of illicit  entry. As  to the  treatment  of suchimmigrants when they are discovered, it should  be the rule thatthey  are at once returned to the country whence they  came.  the rule may possibly work harshly in individual  cases, but unless it isunderstood that  detection  is invariably  followed by  expulsion  thepractice will  not cease.  It is probable that it will cease entirely assoon  as it  is discovered that  the rule is actually  in force.  The  case of the  &quot; pseudo-traveller &quot;  who comes in with permis-sion for a  limited time and continues in Palestine  after the term ofhis permission has expired is more difficult.  Each case  requiresconsideration on its merits.   Where the case is flagrant,  recourseshould  certainly  be had to expulsion.   In cases of no  special flag-rancy,  and where  there  is  no  objection to the  individual, it isprobably sufficient  to maintain the present practice, under which heis counted against the Labour  Schedule, though this method doesa  certain  injustice  to  the Jewish  immigrant outside  the  countrywhose  place  is taken by the traveller concerned.  Immigration and the General Federation of Jeioisli Labour. Inorder to understand the connection between  the question of imini-gration and  the labour movement  in Palestine it is necessary tohave some idea of the activities and policy of the General Federa-tion  of Jewish Labour.  This powerful Federation is in reality far more than a federation of labour  in  the ordinary  sense.   In  theMemorandum which the  Federation submitted  to the Commissionon the  Disturbances it  describes itself  and its own  activities asfollows :       &quot; The General  Federation  of  Jewish  Labour  (Histadruth Haovdin    Haivrim Haklalit) is the  largest  organised  body  within  the  Jewish    population of Palestine.   It numbers 27,000 members, men and  women,    and encompasses  the  whole, range of  the organised  activities  of  the    Jewish working class in  town and country.  It embraces all the Trade    Unions and all the different types of workers&apos; co-operatives in eolonisa-    tion,  production,  consumption,  contracting  and  credit.   Workers&apos;    co-operative settlements  on  the land affiliated with the Histadruth cover    practically the whole field of the agricultural colonisation carried out    by  the  Zionist Organisation  during the last twenty-five years.  Out of    the total  number of  123 Jewish agricultural  communities, settlements    of  this type  number  46.  The  Federation  conducts educational  work    among  adult and  adolescent workers and workers&apos;  children  for which    purpose it has built up  a  net-work of  schools, libraries and reading-    rooms in all labour centres.   It issues a daily paper  and an agricultural    journal and publishes books and pamphlets on social,  educational  and    scientific subjects.  It carries on a medical and sanitary service through    the Workers&apos;  Sick Fund, which maintains  hospitals, clinics, dispensaries,    convalescent homes, and scores of physicians and nurses.  The  Federa-    ticn represents a widespread social organism, its  members  and  their    families accounting for over a quarter of the  Jewish  population ....    The Labour Federation constitutes an important factor  within the world    Zionist movement.  At the last Zionist  Congress more than  a  quarter    of tho total number of delegates represented such Zionist circles, both in    Palestine  and abroad, as are  indentified with  the Federation. . . .&quot;   Settlement of  cases in which members  are  concerned. This Federation refuses to allow  its members  to have recourse  to the Courts of  the land in cases  of  dispute with another member.  It has  its own Courts of first and second instance and its Labour High Court  to  which  appeals from the  subordinate tribunals lie.   Jewish labour as the key-stone of the Jeioish National  Home. - It looks upon Jewish Labour  (which it most effectively represents) as the key-stone  of the  Jewish National Home.   By  permission the  following is quoted from  a  letter  of Dr. Arlosoroff, one of the members of the  Executive  of the Federation.   Referring to  that view, he  says :      &quot; . . .  . (a) The up-building of the National  Home means not only the     return  of a homeless and drifting race to the soil:  but, at the  same     time, the return  of a people which for centuries have been cut off  from     the sources of productive work to a life of labour and toil, the life of  a     self-supporting community.                       -       &quot; (li) Without  tho  manifold kinds of  manual  work which naturally     form part of a pcople&apos;s everyday  life  being  undertaken  by  Jews, the     National  Home in Palestine could never attain to  that degree of  self-     reliance  and  coherence  without  which  it cannot  have  any meaning     whatever in  modern Jewish life.       &quot; (c) The National Home which is not the profit-hunting  enterprise     of  a Chartered  Company -must not be  built upon the foundation of     cheap native  labour exploited by immigrant  capitalism.
      &quot; (d) Jewish enterprise in Palestine is  the result of a conscious effort    on the part of various  Jewish groups and individuals to co-operate for    the purpose of the National Home; it is  based  on the influx of  Jewish    capital public and private and  should  therefore provide the natural    centre of absorption for Jewish labour.      &quot; (e) The young  Jewish  immigrants, more  of  whom are coming to    this country with  the intention of settling on the  land, need a training    ground  for their  future independent  career  as  farmers or  planters;    employment at Jewish  plantations or farms during  a  number of years    provides the necessary training.&quot;The  above note puts shortly  the argument  for  the admission  of jewish labour in the interest  of  building up the  Jewish national home, though  there may already be other labour in the country,competent to do the tasks available.  In another letter the Execu-tive Committee  of the General Federation wrote :     &quot; .  . .  . When, therefore,   immigration is restricted by  administrative    measures, not only is the inalienable Jewish right  of return to  Palestine    assailed but  an  obstacle is also  placed  in the  way  of  the  country&apos;s    general  progress.   At this  point  our meaning  must  not  be misunder-    stood.  We are not basing our claims to unrestricted  immigration  on    the benefits which  the Jewish  influx  confers upon the other  elements of    the population.  We believe ourselves to be fully entitled to serve tiie    interests of the Jewish  masses and to let this consideration determine    our iino of action ....  This is our stand in principle, but it is our    privilego to point to the  fact that in  practice  our immigration  and    settlement,  far from ousting  other  elements,  has  actually  spelt  more    plentiful employment and  a higher standard of life  for tho rest of the    population ....   The  checks  to Jewish  immigration arc hound to    hamper the country&apos;s progress and can therefore  bring no good ,to any    part of its population  ....  Our basic right  recognised by the  Man-    date,  is to  bring  in without hindrance as many  Jews as  Palestine can    be  made to  absorb by  its  tfstural  possibilities  and by our  own con-    structive efforts.    V.&apos;n aro.  therefore,  opposed  to  any  restriction of    immigration which is not  based on  the  prospects of employment; but    upon  such political or  economic reasoning as  fall outside the scope of    Jewish efforts.  It follows  that the control of immigration  must  bo left    in the hands  of the Jewish  Agency, this being  the only responsible body    that is both under an  obligation  and in  a position to strike a balance    between the needs of immigration and the constructive efforts of the    Jewish people.&quot;   The General  Federation  of  Jewish Labour has adopted  a policywhich  implies  the  introduction  into  Palestine of  a  new  socialorder,  based on communal settlements and  the principle of  self-labour.   Where self-labour  is  impossible,  it insists on  the  employ-ment of  Jewish labour  exclusively, by all Jewish  employers.  Ithas been  sufficiently powerful to  impose the  policy on the zionist organisation, to  the extent that,  as it points  out in  the memo-randum from which a quotation  has  been given  above, 46  of the zionist colonies are  based on the principle of communal settlement.This principle was  condemned both by  the Experts in their report and by the Joint Palestine Survey  Commission, but that  fact hashad small effect either on  the Labour  Federation itself or on the zionist Organisation, for communal  labour colonies are  still being constructed.   The question of  the power, the principles and the  activities ofthe  Federation were  discussed  by Dr.   Elwood Mead  and his associates, and at pp. 51 to 53 of the Experts&apos; Deport they wroteas follows :       &quot; The activities of organised labour and  its conception of the extent    to  which  it  should  participate  in  the  founding and  organisation of    settlements and in  the selection of settlers was candidly set forth at a    conference  between  the Commission and  five representatives  of the    Agricultural  Workers&apos;  Association  and  four  members of the General    Federation of Jewish Labour.  At this conference the Commission asked    these  representatives to explain their relation to  rural colonisation and    what  the Federation or its  subsidiary branch, the Agricultural Workers&apos;    Union,  sought to  accomplish.  The  principal reply was  made by  Mr.    Shertok, who is a labour  official,  and an editor  of a Palestine labour    paper.  Ho is a  man  of ability,  sincerity and great influence in the    organisation.   A  part  of his  statement is  incorporated:            &quot; &apos; In  respect to the  agricultural wage-earning works it  (The        Jewish Federation of  Labour)  acts  as  a Trade Union Executive,        negotiates conditions  of employment,  etc., but  in  respect to the        settlements it is not a trade  union  at all, but is more or  less an        economic authority, that  is,  it is responsible on  behalf of nil these        people towards tho  Zionist Executive, the Keren Hayesod, etc., for        the plan  of settlement, the yearly budget, and also it is responsible        for tho human  composition  of  these settlements.   The  Union as        such has  the say an to who is going  to settle  and  how these groups        are going to combine.    The  Union is the authority  for all  these        settlements.&apos;
     &quot; In further explanation of the colonising activities of the General   Federation of  Labour  and of  the  Agricultural Workers&apos; Union,  Mr.   Shertok said:          .&quot; &apos; We must try  and bring in people and  press for more employ-       ment  and make all sorts  of  arrangements that will facilitate pene-       tration of a Jewish working class element in these colonies.  When       we come to the Zionist Executive with a claim for new settlement       and are told  that it is impossible at the  moment we do not always       rest content with such an answer.  We know  the  land, and so we       can come forward with proposals, we make suggestions, we tell them       that wo are going to help them, and  we also give suggestions, some-       times, as to obtaining financial  means.&apos;     &quot; In response to the  Commission^ statement that settlers were suffer-   ing great hardships  and  money was  being  wasted by founding settle-   ments faster than the funds at the control of the  Executive warranted,   Mr.  Shertok replied :           &quot; &apos; Your contention  may be valid only on one assumption,  it is       that the Zionist Organisation,  however  small its  means may be,       has an assured influx  of money, which is not  the case.  This is the       most decisive  factor.   You  say it is  better  to  go slowly but surely,       and then it will go quicker in  the  end,  but  the thing is that the       Zionist  Organisation  gets its money  from  Jews abroad.  Jews are       giving money for Palestine for a variety of  psychological reasons.       They  are making great financial sacrifices;  and the most important       factor is the work  that is being done in Palestine.  Perhaps it will       be true to say that not  Keren Haycsod made the Kmek,  but the       Emek made the Keren Hayesod.   The fact that land  was  bought       and  people rushed  to that  land, made great sacrifices, contented       themselves  with very little,  gave  an impetus  to Zionists abroad to       givo money,  and to Jews at large,  because they  saw what things       were being done in Palestine.&apos;     &quot; The  Commission feels  strongly that  this  belief that it is necessary   to establish new  colonies,  regardless of  ability  to  equip them properly,   in order  to  secure money from abroad  is a delusion.   It is confident   that the interest  in a  national home does not  have to be sustained by   wasting  money or  squandering the time and  efforts of  setters  as is   now being done.   Furthermore, the financial situation which  is  being   created will  discredit the Zionist movement unless promptly changed.   The financial and economic statements  that have been secured ought   to be carefully studied  by those interested in this matter.     &quot; It is the view of the Commission that activity of a particular group   or party is  undesirable; that the influence of the  Jewish Federation of   Labor is  giving these  colonies  a  character  not  in harmony with  he   ideals  and  aspirations  of  the  Jewish race.    It is believed that the   opportunity  to live in  the open country ought to be  available to the   Jewish  people  regardless of their views  on social or economic questions.   To place one  party so largely  in  control is a discrimination  against   many who would  be&apos; valuable additions  to the rural life of Palestine.     &quot; The Commission has  been unable to escape  the conclusion that the   rate at which  colonies  have  been founded, the  selection  of settlers for   those colonies, and the organization and equipment of the Colonization   Department have been largely influenced,  if  not controlled,  by the   General Federation of  Jewish Labor.  We are therefore of the opinion,   as  already stated  in our major conclusion No. 4,  &apos; that the Department   of - Agricultural Colonization should  be reorganized and placed in charge   of officials committed to  the  primary aim of creating a.  self-sustaining    agriculture,  rather  than  of  establishing a  new  social  and economic   order.&apos;      &quot; The Commission has no  opposition to labor.  On the contrary, its   members  believe in organised labor, but it has the same  opposition to   labor control and  colonization in Palestine that  it would have to control    by bankers,  lawyers or any particular party or  economic group . . . .&quot;  In Sir John Campbell&apos;s &quot;  Report on (he Jewish Settlements &quot;,published  in the same volume, he wrote at p. 436.    &quot; .  . .  .  Effective practical control has in  a large measure passed out    of  the  hands  of  the Palestine Executive into  the hands  of a  political    organization.  The Labour Federation  has,  in  practice,  controlled the    situation.  From  the initial  selection of the immigrants, down  through    finance and technical departments to the choice of the men to be settled,    the place where  they  are to  be settled, the resources to be placed at    their disposal, the plan to be followed  in establishing them, the appor-    tionment of funds as  between  different  classes of settlers, the Labour    Federation has governed the situation.   In other  words, the body  which.    is technically and ostensibly responsible for the work has not in practice    effectively, controlled that work; power has been, more or less completely    divorced from responsibility.&quot;   The sources of immigration. Of the Jewish  immigrants  over 70per  cent,  come  from  Poland, Russia  and  Rumania.   Of  recentyears  there has also been a  large  influx of Yemenite Jews.   In a supplement to the  Memorandum of the  Jewish  Agency sub-mitted for the purposes of this enquiry, the  reasons for the extent
of the immigration from these  four  countries  is explained.   Withreference to  Poland  it  is  said  :     &quot; . .  .  . This situation was aggravated by the fact that there simul-    taneously arose amongst the Poles themselves a movement to enter that    field  of  activity which was previously controlled by  the  Jews.  This    economic penetration was accompanied by a national economic struggle,    in which state and  people worked together to  eject the Jews from their    former economic positions,  making considerable  use of the  co-operative    movement  for this  purpose. All these  factors combined to  bring ruin    upon  the Jews of Poland, rendering immigration on a large scale impera-    tive.  It is particularly for the Jewish youth  of Poland, which aspires    to go  over to manual labour and productive pursuits, that Palestine    affords the essential solution.&quot;  In regard to Russia it records :     &quot; . .  . . The Jewish religion also has  been singled out for malicious and    savage persecution.  Thus for the Jews of Russia the appalling economic    conditions  to which they  have been reduced,  and the political  and    religious persecution  to  which  they are  continuously exposed, make    emigration the only possible alternative to economic extinction on the    one hand and racial and moral  degeneration on the other .  . .  .&quot;  As to  Rumania it is recorded :                  ?           &quot; With  the post-war  annexations  by  Roumania of  Bessarabia,    Bukovina,  and Transylvania, the Jewish population rose from 960,000    souls, whose  economic condition is aggravated by the  fact  that a con-    siderable  proportion of them -those  of Bessarabia have  been cut  off    from  their former  economic hinterland  in  Russia.  Political depression    and periodical anti-Semitic excesses are further factors in the Palestine    movement  among the  Jews of  this  country,  where Zionism has been    strong since  the founding of the first Jewish  Colonies  in Palestine and    the inception of modern Zionism . .  . .&quot;  In regard to the Yemen it is  written in the  supplement :-             The Jewish community dates  back to  pre-Islamic times  and    estimates as to its  numbers vary from forty  to sixty thousand souls.    These  Jews are deprived of all civil rights, while  there is in  force a    monstrous  decree that all orphans who are minors become  wards of the    Imam, and must adopt Islam,  a decree which in recent years has been    enforced more rigorously than previously.  The Jews of the  Yemen are    for the most part skilled workers in handicrafts or agriculturists, while    being bred to life in the Orient they  very readily assimilate Palestinian    conditions.  The journey from  the Yemen to  the coast of Aden takes    twenty days; and is fraught by  perils of brigandage and murder, yet by    this terrible route  some 2,000  Yemenite  Jews  have entered Palestine    since the War. Of  these no less than 600 entered during the past year,    their departure from the Yemen being largely  stimulated by fear of the    decree as to the forcible conversion of  orphan children .  . . .&quot;  The above is a very frank explanation of the reasons  which haveactuated  the  movement from   these four countries to  Palestine.By the  Zionist Palestine is regarded  as  the  haven of  refuge forthe  distressed  Jew,  and the National  Home  is  being  peopled toa  great  extent for  the  time  being,  by  those who escape from countries where distress is  most pronounced:  Immigration  and  Unemployment. It is widely believed andcommonly  alleged  among   the  Arabs  that  unemployment  among them is  due to Jewish immigration  and  the  competition  of  Jewishlabour.  In so far  as Jewish  labour is employed  on works whichare being carried out solely with  imported Jewish capital,  there isno  basis for  the belief.    It  is  however impossible  to ascertain whether labour has been imported in  excess of what is necessaryfor these purposes.   Indeed from  the fact of the increased employ-ment of  Jewish Labour on other  enterprises, as  for  instance inthe  Public  Works Department, on the railways, in  building enter-prises such  as Hotel,  Y\M.C.A.  buildings  and other edifices notpaid  for by purely Jewish  capital,  it  might be argued that moreJewish labourers have been imported than are necessary  for purelyJewish requirements,  and  that,  to  this  extent, the  Arab labour market  has been adversely affected by  Jewish immigration.  Onthe  other hand, there is no doubt  that the development which has followed  on  Jewish  immigration during  the  last nine  years,  has provided additional  openings  for Arab labour.  The expansion ofthe orange trade alone requires the services of a large  number of arab porters  and boatmen at   the ports.  The same may  be saidof the large imports  of  machinery and material in connection withthe Jordan Concession,  with the  Dead  Sea Concession, with theconstruction  and working of the &quot; Nesher &quot;  Cement Company.  all of these have provided a certain amount  of work for Arabs, chiefly
on the heavier and more menial tasks.  In many directions Jewishdevelopment  has meant more work for the Arabs, and it  is a fairconclusion that  the  competition of  imported Jewish labour  isequalized by  those increased opportunities.  Figures  in  regard  to  the  numbers   of  unemployment. Nostatistics, except those provided monthly by the Immigration De-partment, exist, and these are admittedly unreliable.  The reportedfigures for the  current year are as follows : Month.	Jems.	Arabs. ! Total. \	1930-January February ......... March ... April May June	850 800 600 1,000 650 1,300	2,000 2,400 2,300 2,400 2,200 2,600	2,850 3,200 2,900 3,400 2850 3,900  The information on which the monthly unemployment figures are based is obtained, under existing arrangements, by officers ofthe Immigration Department in Jerusalem, Jaffa and Haifa, and byPolice Officers elsewhere.   Enquiries into  changes in  wage-ratesand into conditions of labour are made by the same officers.  OtherDepartments may  he  and are from time to time  consulted,  andreadily  communicate  any available  information, but in their  casealso the machinery necessary to an effective enquiry does not exist.The staff of the section of the Immigration Department responsiblefor collecting labour information was reduced to a minimum in 1928for reasons of economy, and since that time the  work in connectionwith immigration proper, including,  as it does, reference to Londonand to the Commandant of Police in every case  of a visa for Pales-tine, in favour of a resident in Russia, has resulted in superficial andhurried preparation of the estimates of Arab unemployment.  It isreported that information collected by the Police is even less satis-factory.  The duty is one for which the Police officers have no train-ing, no time and no aptitude.   Enquiries necessary for the prepara-tion of unemployment returns are in no sense a police function.   Infact,  in this instance they are called upon to perform a duty withwhich they should  never have been  charged.  For the Jewish authorities, with their extensive system of labour exchanges and the Statistical Department  of the  Labour Federa-tion,  it is an easy matter to provide information on the subject of jewish unemployment which  may be regarded  as accurate  andexact.  In the case of  Arab unemployment, it is clear  that no adequate machinery exists  which would  enable an opinion, evenapproximately accurate,  to  be formed at any given moment.  Arab unemployment. At the same time there  can be no doubtwhatever that there is at the  prseent time serious unemployment among Arab  craftsmen and among  Arab labourers.  For  this  un-employment there  are several causes. Motor transport, largely inthe hands of  the Jews, is driving the camel and the donkey off theroads, and with them  the Arab camel-driver and the Arab donkey-man.   The motor car, again largely owned and driven by Jews, isdisplacing  the horse-drawn  vehicles and its Arab driver.  The in-crease use of cement reinforced concrete  and  silicate brick, allmanufactured by Jews, is replacing  dressed  stone for constructionalpurposes, and so displacing  a large  number  of stone-dressers andstonemasons,  nearly all  of whom were Arabs.  The Arab quarry-men are also being displaced.  But probably the most serious  cause of additional unemployment is the cessation of conscription for  the army, prevalent under theTurkish Government.  The young men now remain in the villages.Formerly they were despatched to the Yemen or to Anatolia, andmany, indeed the majority, of them, failed  to  return.  In  Jewish circles the story of Arab unemployment is regarded asa myth.  There are also individual  members  of the British Colonyat Jerusalem who do not consider it serious.  It is difficult to,form an opinion, impossible to dogmatise, on thesubject of Arab unemployment, but careful consideration of available
80O895sources of information on the subject supports the belief that suchunemployment not only  exists but is serious and widespread.  Theestimate  submitted  by  the  Supreme  Moslem   Council,  thataltogether from 30,000  to 35,000  Arabs are unemployed,  may bediscarded.   The figures  were described as &quot; fairly  reliable.&quot;  Noexplanation was  offered as to the  authority by whom they  were supplied.  There is, however, material and important evidence insupport of the fact that many Arabs cannot find employment.  Anote  by  Miss Margaret  Nixon,  Government  Welfare  Worker,records that from  her personal knowledge there is very serious un-einployment among Arabs of the artisan class in Jerusalem.  ;Shesuggests that  the reason lies in the refusal of Jewish employers to engage Arab labourers in view of the riots of last August.  enquiry was made from a British  Police Officer who had made a personalinvestigation into  the question at  Haifa.  He reports that  in thattown alone  2,050  Arabs are unemployed, including  200 carpentersand 300 stonemasons.   From  Trans-Jordania it  was ascertained that a report  that  further recruits  were required for the frontier force  resulted in  &quot; well over &quot; 4,000 men, mainly  from palestine and Northern Trans-Jordan, besieging  the Headquarters  of theForce  in  hope  of employment.  In  Bamleh  there were  120applicants for the post  of  scavenger overseer on a salary of  2,750mils ( 2 15s.) a month.  The Director of the Public Works Department was considted onthe question and  stated that there  was no difficulty whatever inobtaining ail  the  labour required  for  his Department.  The pro-gramme of that Department for the future is important and includes12 or 13 buildings which will cost  from  140,000 to  150,000.  Inhis opinion, even  if Jewish immigration were to cease altogether,there would be no difficulty in obtaining the personnel necessary tocomplete these undertakings.  The Resident Engineer of the  Haifa Harbour  Work wrote  onthis subject :      &quot; . . . .  There  is no question but what there is a very great deal of    unemployment in the Arab section of the population,  and I have little    doubt that,  so far as the Harbour Works are concerned, labour  require-    ments could be met two or three times over.  Just as an illustration,    about a fortnight ago  we engaged some 40 additional  men to  work at    the Quarries near Athlit.  The news that more men  had been started    quickly spread,  and on one  morning last week I myself saw a huge    crowd  of Arabs seeking  work, and thev must have  numbered some    400 or 500 men . . . .&quot;Many  of the Area and District  Officers were consulted.  They ex-pressed an  unanimous opinion that Arab unemployment is serious and general.  In  the  face of  this information  from independent sources it isimpossible to  avoid  the  conclusion  that unemployment among theArabs  is a serious feature of  the  economic life of  Palestine at thepresent time.   Much information was  also volunteered as to the trend of Arab wages, from which  it would  appear  that unemploy-ment,  as is natural with unorganised labour, is affecting the standardof  life.  The  information obtained  indicates  that  in the  case of skilled artisans, carpenters and stone-dressers the fall in wage ratesamounts to 50 per cent.  A competent artisan can still earn 15 to20  piastres  (3s. to 4s. per day).   A fellah workman is content toaccept 8 to  10 piastres (Is. 8d. to 2s.).  The Deputy District Com-missioner of Jerusalem stated  that this year (1930) tenders for muni-cipal contracts were at half the rates demanded in 1929, the decreasebeing due to the fall in Arab wages.  The tales told by Arab work-men themselves were impressive.   Several of them  were men whohad enjoyed a certain measure of  ease and  prosperity in  the past,but whose conditions had  deteriorated  during recent years.   Therewere master-masons who used to employ a number of subordinates,yet now are not only not in a position  to  employ  any assistants,but are themselves destitute, owing to the  inability to find work.There  were carpenters who produced excellent certificates and arein the same plight.  There were labourers who are willing to accept any wage if only- they  could obtain work.   All of  them ascribedtheir   misfortunes,  probably   quite  erroneously,  to   Jewishcompetition.  Further immigration  and  its effect on Arab unemployment. Itis thus evident that Arabs are unemployed in at least considerable
numbers, and that the fact is resulting in a distinct reduction of thestandard  of  life  among the Arab  labouring class.  As has  been pointed out,  the policy of the Jewish Labour Federation is success-ful in  impeding the employment of Arabs both in Jewish colonies and in Jewish enterprises of every kind.   There is therefore  norelief  to  be  anticipated from  an  extension of  Jewish enterpriseunless some  departure from existing practice  is  effected.   Recent  increase  in  Jewish  unemployment. There   is  alsoevidence  of increasing unemployment among the Jews  at the pre-sent time.   The return of unemployment for the month of  Juneshowed that  1,300 Jews are out of work as compared with 650 in theprevious month.   The Labour paper, &quot; Daver,&quot; published by theGeneral Federation of Jewish  Labour, wrote  on 8th July :     &quot; . . . . Conditions of employment during  the  last  weeks have  grown    worse  ....   Hundreds  of  cheap labour are  employed in  seasonal    work .... And the Jewish labourer goes idle  ....  The help from    our central organisations  is  required  in  order  to avoid undesired    developments, especially at the present time.&quot;Next day- it  wrote :     &quot; . . . . The present situation  requires the mobilisation of all  public    forces to meet the danger.  Many of the employers in the colonies have    recently forgotten all shame when dealing with  the question of Jewish    employment.&quot;   The  Chief Immigration  Officer writes on this question, after a visit to the  large village of Petach Tikvah :     &quot; . . . . The presence  of men and women  without work could not be    concealed.  The representative of the  local trade union admitted  about    200 unemployed  but assured  us  that  this was  merely a temporary    matter ....  Tho local  police estimated unemployment at between 300    and 3-50, a figure that is probably correct . . . .&quot; The reason for the unemployment appears  to be the fall in the priceof oranges,  which renders  it difficult for the growers to  pay the higher rate of wages for pluckers, and so employ Arab  or Yemenite labour.   Duty of Government in regard to immigration. A serious  ques- tion thus arises in connection with the immigration of Jewish labour, and with the labour schedule  which regulates that immigration. There appears to be  no question as to the policy which should be adopted by the Palestine Government in this matter.   It is the duty of the Government  to  look upon  the  country as one  unit.    The solution of the question facing the  Government,  in determining the number of Jewish labourers to be admitted, must depend, not on the amount of Jewish unemployment in reference  to anticipated employment in the half-year for which the schedule is framed,  but on unemployment generally in Palestine.   It  is wrong that  a Jew from  Poland, Lithuania,  or the Yemen, should be admitted  to fill an existing vacancy, while there exist in Palestine workmen capable of filling that vacancy, who are.unable to find employment.  This policy will be unacceptable to the Jewish authorities.    Employment of Arabs in Jewish concerns. One of the Executive of the Jewish Labour Federation put the case quite  clearly.  He said,  &quot; We would not initiate the work  if we were  compelled to employ  Arab labour.   The  Zionist object in  development is to employ Jews.  Unless Jews can be employed we fail in our object.&quot; The  principle  underlying  this statement is  logical  and  compre- hensible. The Jews do not spend their capital  in the development of Palestine in order that Arab unemployment should  be overcome. Nevertheless, by the Government, Palestine must be  treated as an entity and there must be no discrimination between the races  which it contains.   If there is unemployment, whether Jewish or Arab, it is clearly the duty of the  Government to  prevent  immigration if such  immigration  will  intensify  that  unemployment or  prevent its cure.      Derived Demand.&quot; There is one special case to which  the principles enunciated above will not apply.  It has been pointed out that  Jewish capital will not&quot;  be brought into  Palestine in order to employ Arab labour.   It will come in with the definite object  of the employment of Jewish labour and not otherwise.  The principle of    derived demand &quot;  would justify  the immigration of Jewish labour even when  there are Arab  unemployed in the  country  if the newly- imported Jewish labour is  assured of work  of a permanent nature,
through the introduction oPJewish capital to provide the work onwhich that labour is to be employed.   It is clearly of no advantage to the  unemployed Arab  thai  Jewish capital should be prevented from entering the country, and he is  in a no worse position by theimportation of Jewish labour  to do  work in Palestine for  whichthe funds are available by the  simultaneous importation of Jewishcapital.   In fact, he is better off, as the expenditure of  that capitalon wages to Jewish workmen will cause, ultimately, a  demand forthe services of a portion of the  Arab unemployed.  It is in this way that the principle of &quot; derived demand &quot; works in his case.  The Government, however, must be well assured that  the employ-ment for which the Jewish labour is imported is permanent  in its nature, that this labour will not be employed for a time and thenthrown on to the laFour  market.   This would  only aggravate theunemployment position in the country.  It would be justifiable that the Government should demand fromthe Jewish Organisations that  a security fund should be initiated,to assure against Jewish  unemployment  in all  such cases.    If asubstantial sum were deposited with the Government as a guarantee,to provide  for the maintenance of over-imported labour, in case ofunemployment, it would be a much easier task for the Governmentto deal with the Labour  Schedule.    Negotiations on  this subjectmight be undertaken between the  Palestine Government and theJewish Agency for  Palestine.  Unemployment  statistics  and  Government  Employment  Ex-changes. The principle that the preparation of the Labour Scheduleshall depend on the total unemployment in Palestine demands thatthe existence of that unemployment shall be accurately determined.As has been shown above, no machinery exists at the present time which  permits of  an accurate estimate  of  Arab  unemployment.Such machinery must be  devised.  In the towns this result mightbe obtained by the creation of Government Employment  Exchanges,with which the existing Jewish exchanges would be amalgamated.Arrangements to facilitate the employment of the unemployed is i..efunction  of a  Government rather than that of  one section of thepopulation.    The  existence  of Employment  Exchanges  w-onldpermit of a comparatively  accurate  estima ion  of  the  number ofPalestinian  unemployed,  whether  Arab,  Jew  or  other,  at  any moment.  In the villages, the question is of  great difficulty.  It might beentrusted to the Area and District Officers,  who could  obtain theinformation through the Mukhtars (Headmen) of the villages.   Thequestion  of machinery is one for the  Palestinian Government, but whatever machinery  may  be  employed it should be such  as will afford to the Government at any time, or at such  stated intervalsas may be laid down, accurate information as to the total numberof unemployed, classified  according  to  their occupations.   only when  such reliable information is  available will it be possible toprepare the immigration schedule on a rational basis.  Seasonal and occasional labour. There are tw7o obvious dangersagainst  which  provision  must be made  in the  execution  of any measures dealing with the registration  of unemployment.    Thefirst lies  in the large amount  of casual  and temporary  unemploy-ment  of  the agricultural  labourer  and indeed of the  small  Arabcultivator.   Of this class  many individuals flock to the towns inorder  to  earn  something in addition to  what  is  yielded  by theland.   The agricultural labourer is  paid entirely  in kind, while, inthe case  of the small cultivator, unless he can eke out his incomeduring the  agricultural  oil-season,  he  is frequently   unable toobtain  the cash  necessary to  pay  his taxes  or his  moneylender,and for  the  year&apos;s purchases  which  are  essential for  his house-hold.   There can be  no valid reason  for  refusal  to register as un-employed temporary  labourers of this kind,  if they are in fact inthe labour market,  and  in fact unemployed.  The regulations ofthe employment  exchanges should,  however, be so  framed as toensure that the  names of  persons of this class seeking  em ploy -ment  should be  removed  when  seasonal  activity causes them toreturn from the towns to the villages.  Importation  of other than  Jewish labour. Further, it is clearthat if unemployment is a valid reason for preventing Jewish imm-gration, it is also a reason for  preventing  importation of labour of
    30C3            98other nationalities.   At die time of writing, even with  markedunemployment among Arabs, Egyptian labour is being employedin certain individual cases, and its ingress has been the subject ofadverse comment in the  Press.  Prevention  of illicit immigration. Finally,  in  closing the frontdoor, steps should be taken to ensure that the  backdoor should notbe kept open  for would-be immigrants into  Palestine.  The ChiefImmigration Officer has brought to notice that illicit immigrationthrough  Syria and  across the  northern frontier of Palestine ismaterial.   This question has already  been discussed.   It  may  bea difficult  matter to ensure against this illicit  immigration,  butsteps to this end must be taken if the policy  proposed  is adopted,as also to prevent  unemployment lists being swollen by immigrants from Tra ns-Jorda nia.  Arab unemployment  as a  political pawn. The question of un-employment  and  immigration  has  been treated  solely from theeconomic standpoint.  It has immediate political repercussions withwhich this enquiry is not concerned, but which must receive con-sideration from His Majesty&apos;s Government in arriving at a decision.Two of these  repercussions will require particular attention :  First, Arab  unemployment is liable to be used as a political pawn.Arab politicians are sufficiently astute to realise at once what may appear an easy method of blocking that immigration, to  which theyare radically averse, and attempts may and probably will be madeto swell the list of Arab unemployed with names  which should notbe there, or perhaps to ensure the registration of an  unemployedman in the books of more than  one exchange.   It should not provedifficult to defeat this manoeuvre.  Article 6 of the  Mandate and its effect on immigration. Second,there is the repercussion  on the policy of the Jewish National Home.It is evident that any interference with the freedom of immigrationis a  limitation to the admission of Jews who desire to take part inthe local constitution of that Home.  Article 6 of the Mandate, how-ever, directs that the rights and position of other sections of thepopulation shall not be prejudiced by Jewish immigration.  Clearly,if immigration of Jews  results in  preventing  the Arab  populationobtaining the work necessary for its maintenance, it is  the duty ofthe  Mandatory Power, under the Mandate&apos;, to reduce, or,  if neces-sary, to suspend, such immigration, until the unemployed portionof the &quot; other sections &quot; is in a position to obtain work.   Elsewhere  in this report the exclusion of Arab labour from theland purchased by the Jewish  National  Fund has been discussed,and it is pointed out that this exclusion is liable to confirm a belief that it is  the intention  of the Jewish authorises to  displace theArab population by progressive stages from Palestine.   It is clearthat this belief, which,  however unfounded  it may be, is  unfor-unfortunately very widely held,  will be confirmed when it is realised that the immigration of Jewish labour is permitted while the Arabcannot earn  his daily  bread.   On general  grounds, therefore, aswell as in&quot; order to carry out  the  terms of  Article 6 of the Man-date,  it is necessary that  the  existence of  Arab  unemployment should be  taken into consideration when determining  the numberof Jews to be admitted  at the time of preparation of  the LabourSchedule.   Suspension of the Labour Schedule. A further question whichhas developed marked political importance is that of the suspension of immigration under the Labour Schedule which was ordered byHis  Majesty&apos;s  Government at the end of  the month of May ofthe  present year.   That Schedule was prepared in the  ordinary way and  sanctioned by the High  Commissioner.  Its  suspensioncaused the greatest excitement, which has even now not altogether subsided.   At the time  there is no doubt that  the recommendations of  the Chief Immigration Officer, and  the  decision of the  High Commissioner were justified by the prospects  of work in Palestine. Since that time  conditions have changed  and  there  are at the moment  signs  of  an economic crisis in Palestine.  Prices have fallen suddenly and heavily.  As has been shown in this  Chapter. unemployment is widespread  and is  increasing.  The immediate outlook for industry is  bad.   Economically it would be unwise to
allow into the country a large number of  additional  workmen for whom work must be found, when there is at the moment difficultyin finding work even for Jewish workmen.  To leave the economic  argument  for a moment, it is  said thatthere is  an  important psychological aspect of  the question whichescapes the notice of an enquiry purely economic.  The suspension of Labour immigration, it  is alleged, has created the impression that the British Government is, if not hostile at least apathetic inthe matter of the National Home and that this attitude finds  itsexpression in  the suspension in question.   As a result of the im-pression so created, the flow of capital to Palestine and of subscriptions-tions for the settlement  work  in that country  have both  been affected.  The capitalist doubts the  security of his  capital.  Thebenevolent questions the utility of his subscription if the national home is in the end to prove a phantom.   Those who use these arguments, and they are universally usedamong  the  Jewish community,  suggest that  there  is in fact  no danger  in re-opening immigration.   On the contrary they are ofthe opinion  that the cancellation of the order of suspension would at once restore confidence, stimulate the flow of money to Palestine, and so prevent the very economic difficulty which is anticipated.   There is weight to be attached to these opinions and those argu- ments.   They are used by  those who have  the most acute know- ledge of Jewish psychology.  Yet from the purely economic stand- point, it has to be said that to cancel the suspension would be to take a risk, not justified by the economic  position of the moment. It is not the province of this report  to suggest whether it would or would not prove justifiable  from the political standpoint.   Preparation  of  the  Labour  Schedule:  Proposed  change  in method. It is  probable  that a slight change in the method of preparation of the Labour  Schedule would  tend  to increase the amicable relations between the  Jewish  authorities  in  Palestine and the Immigration Department.   There  is no reason why the Schedule should not  be  prepared  by the  representatives of the Jewish Agency and the Immigration Department working together. If thought  desirable  some  commercial  authorities outside  the Agency and the Government might  be called into Council as,  for example, the Manager of Barclay&apos;s  (Overseas) Bank at Jerusalem and the Manager of  the Anglo-Palestine Company, each of whom is in intimate touch with the economic position in Palestine.   If the representatives of the Agency  and the Department were in full agreement the agreed schedule would be submitted for  the orders of the  High Commissioner, who would doubtless accept it as it stood. If  on the other hand there was disagreement  on any of the items of the Schedule,  the items on which agreement had been reached might be  submitted under  the signature of both  parties, and  separate schedules submitted  in respect  of items  on  which there was  disagreement.    The  High Commissioner  would then pass such orders as he thought fit.   Formation of a Department of Immigration: Labour and Travel.  At the present time  the  Immigration work is done by a section of the Police Department.   The  work is very voluminous and  im- portant and it is unsuitable that it should  be connected in any way even nominally, with the Police.  The amount of work and the size of the staff both justify the creation of a Department of Immigra- tion, specially as the Immigration  staff deal also with Travel and with Labour.  In  view of the additional work which will fall upon this staff in consequence of the necessity to create a  service for the registration  of unemployment,  it is exceedingly desirable that  the Immigration Service should  be  detached  from the Police  Depart- ment and constituted a Department of Immigration,  Labour and Travel.
                        CHAPTER XL                          Conclusion.  Tn  this Report  the  subjects of Land Settlement, development and Immigration have been examined in that order as it is evidentthat the question  of Immigration depends on the action  taken  inrespect  of the first two.   It now remains to make a resume of thefacts  which have been  established in the course of this Enquiry.                             LAND.          Land available for settlement.   (Chapter II.)   It  has emerged quite  definitely from  the present enquiry thatthere is at the present time and  with the  present methods of Arabcultivation  no  margin of  land  available  for  agricultural settle-ment by new immigrants, with  the exception of such undevelopedland  as the various Jewish Agencies hold in reserve.         Government Lands.   (Chapter I.  Section (iii).)   The most  important of lands,  the property of the Government atthe time the Mandate was given,  were the Beisan area and the Huleh  Basin.   Of these the Beisan area was settled, in accordance with the terms of the Mudawwara Agreement of 1921,  with the Arabs already in occupation or who had claims to possession.  The Huleh  Basin was subject to a  concession already granted by the Ottoman  Government  which  was confirmed  by  the  iPalestine Government.  Of other  considerable  areas the  Kabbara Swamp, the Ceserea Sand-dunes  and a  portion of the lands of  Athlit, an area in the  neighbourhood of  39,000 dunams was ceded to  the P.I.C.A.  It is an error to imagine that the Government  is in possession  of large areas of vacant  lands which could  be  made available for Jewish settlement.  In fact  free areas are  negligible in extent.   The  Government claims considerable areas which  are in fact occupied and cultivated by  Arabs.  Even were the title of the  Government admitted, and  it is in many cases  disputed, it would  not be feasible to make those areas available for settlement in view of  the impossibility of finding  other  lands on  which to place the Arab cultivators.    The  provision  of a margin depends on material  progress in the development of  the  land, already included  in holdings.  It  has been shown that the  area of cultivable land in Palestine  (excluding the  Beersheba region) is 6,544,000 dunams, considerably less than has  hitherto been estimated.  It  has also  been shown that, while an area of at  least 130 dunams  is  required to maintain a  fellah family in a decent standard of life  in the unirrigated tracts, the whole of the cultivable  land not already in the hands  of the Jews would  not  accord an average lot  in  excess of 90 dunams, were it  divided among  the existing  Arab  cultivators.   (diaper III.)  Eor an average holding of 130 dunams, about eight million dunams  of cultivable land would be required.  It  also appears that  of the  86,980 rural Arab families  in the villages, 29.4 per cent, are land-  less.  It is not  known  how many of these are families who  pre-  viously cultivated and have since  lost then land.  This is a matter  which should  be ascertained in the  course of the Census which is  to take place next  year.    Present  agricultural  policy. The  condition  of  the Arab fellah  is little if at all  superior to what  it was under  the  Turkish regime.  No definite policy  Of agricultural development of the country  held  by  the Arabs has been adopted.   The  sole  agencies which have  provided such a consistent policy have been  the  Jewish Colonisa-  tion Departments, public and  private.   With this exception agri-  cultural  progress of any  kind  has  been haphazard  and  of  small  extent or value.    Jewish and Arab advantages and disadvantages.. (Chapter V.)    The Jewish settlers  have had every  advantage that capital, science   and organization could give them.   To these and to  the  energy   of the settlers themselves their remarkable progress  is  due.    (Chapter VI.) The Arab has had none of these advantages and  has received practically no help  to  improve his cultivation or his
3008101standard of life.  The Arab  population  has increased with greatrapidity and the land available for its sustenance has meanwhiledecresed by about a million metric dunams which have passed intothe hands  of  the Jews.  Compensation  of Beduin for loss of grazing rights.   (ChapterVI.)--The problem of the Beduin requires careful investigation,in order that their rights may be  ascertained.  Where those rightsconflict with the requirements of the State for agricultural develop-ment, the  Beduin  should be  compensated,  if those  rights  areannulled.  Alterations  of terms under which Jewish  National Fund  pur-chases and leases land. (Chapter V.  Section (iii).) Reference hasbeen  made to the terms on  which  the  Jewish  National Fundpurchases and leases its land.  It is there recorded that those termsare objectionable and should be radically altered.  Government&apos;s  duty under the Mandate. It was the duty of theAdministration, under the Mandate, to ensure that the position ofthe Arabs  was not prejudiced by Jewish immigration.   It is alsoits duty under the Mandate to encourage the close settlement of theJews on  the  land, subject  always  to the  former condition.   Itis only possible to reconcile  these apparently  conflicting duties byan active  policy  of agricultural development,  having  as  its objectclose  settlement on the land and intensive cultivation by both arabs and Jews.   To this end  drastic action is necessary.  Agricultural Development Scheme.  (Chapter  VII.) A methodi-cal  scheme of agricultural development should be thought out andundertaken, which will  ensure the use of the land of  the countryto better purpose than has been the case hitherto.  This  develop-ment should have two distinct aims :   Improvement of the Fellah&apos;s methods.   (Chapter VII.) In thefirst place, to  improve the method of cultivation of the Arab fellahin the dry tracts,  and also  to  extend irrigation wherever that ispossible, so that the fellah will  be able to gain a reasonable livelihood-bood from a  smaller  area  of  land  than  that which has   beenconsidered essential hitherto.  Development of intensive  agriculture. In  the  second place 30to re-arrange  holdings of land, that there will be a margin forfurther settlement in accordance  with  the terms of Article  6 ofthe Mandate.  Development of irrigation. If such development is undertaken in accordance  with a  definite plan and the cultivable land of thePlains  of  Palestine  improved, as in many  places they &apos;-an  be improved,  by  the provision of water for irrigation, there  will un-questionably be  sufficient land  both for Arabs  and for  additionalJewish settlement.  The results desired will not  be obtained except by  years of work.  Jewish  reserves of land. It is for this reason peculiarly fortunatethat  the Jewish organizations are in possession of a  large reserve of land not yet settled or developed.  Their operations can continue without a  break while the general scheme of development is beingworked out and brought into operation.  Control  of disposition of land. Until the scheme is worked outthe  control of all  disposition of land must of necessity rest  withthe  authority  in charge  of  the  development.  Transfers should only  be permitted in so  far as  they do not interfere  with  that scheme.  Powers  for  Government purchase  of  land. In  order  that  any scheme of  development should be a success, the authority controlling the  development must  be able  to  obtain  the land  which  it isintended to develop.  It may be possible that  arrangements to thisend can be concluded amicably  between the Government and theowner of the land.  In such cases naturally  the Government wouldbuy  the land.   It should also  have  the  power to purchase  at  avaluation  all  land  for sale in the market.   On  the other  hand inany case  in which the  Government refuses to  sanction  a sale ofland, the  would-be vendor should have the right  to  demand thatthe Government take  over that land at a valuation.
   It may be  however that  the  Government will not  be  able  to acquire the  land it needs  by private arrangement or by purchase at a valuation.  In such  a case : it already has the power to act under  the Expropriation of Land Ordinance  Iso. 28 of 1926, and to acquire the land at a valuation,  as  being  required for a public purpose.   Development  Commission. The development of  the  land could best be ensured by the  appointment  of  a Development Commis- sion, invested with the necessary  powers.   It is desirable that there  should be a Chairman  of  British nationality, one  Arab  Commissioner  and one Jewish Commissioner.   Responsibilities  of  the  Development Commission. The  Corn- mission would not only undertake the development of the land but would  also be  responsible for its colonisation,  both by Arab and by Jew.   Until the survey is finished  and the census is taken  next year,  it is impossible to  say what the actual area available for cultivation may be and the number of Arab families whom it  may be necessary  to  displace.   There  is however  little doubt that the available land, if properly developed,  will be able  to  maintain a much larger population than that settled upon it  at the  present time.   Available areas in the plains. The  Jewish Agency has  made a calculation which indicates that there is room for 54,900 additional families in  three of the five plains, namely,  the Maritime Plain, the  Huleh Plain, and the Jordan Valley,  including Beisan.  This is the result of a careful and detailed examination of the cultivable area and of the possibilities  of development.   It is true that the figures accepted in this calculation differ from  those of the Director of Surveys in certain areas, and it would  not  be possible to accept the  estimate as  strictly accurate.  It is at the  same time  certain that  a  very   large number of  families  can  be   provided  with improved holdings  in  these areas.   It is impossible to give  anything like a  reliable estimate  of the number of  families who  could be accommodated in Palestine,  if the  whole country were adequately  developed.   The development of 100,000 dunams  in  certain areas of  the Maritime Plain might perhaps provide sufficient land for the settlement of  5,000 to 6,500 families.  Accommodation  would probably be thus provided  for the families already on the spot,  together with 2,000 families of Arabs from the congested areas in the Hills and 2,000 families of  Jewish settlers.  A similar area in Beisan would  not  provide for so many families, possibly for one-half or two-thirds of the number.   Every- thing depends  on water for irrigation and markets for the produce. But there can be no doubt  whatever that systematic and methodical development over a series  of years  will change the whole  aspect of agricultural Palestine,  and admit of a very largely  increased population.   Go-ordination  of. Development  Schemes. Any scheme  of  de- velopment should provide  for the settlement  both  of Jews  and of Arabs on a  developed  area, and should take  into consideration the  plans  of  colonisation  of the  Jewish  agencies,  in  order that development by  those agencies and  by  the Commission might be co-ordinated.   It  might  well  prove   possible  to  combine  two schemes of development  in certain  areas  with  mutual advantage and  with considerable  economy.   Coat  of settling a family. It is believed that the  average ex- penditure on  settling  one Arab family  will be   60.   This does not provide for anything luxurious in the way of settlement.  The Arab builds his own house.   It costs him  10  per room.    If he builds a house  of two  rooms,  40 will remain, which will be suffi- cient to provide him  with a good  cow,  an  iron plough  and a harrow.   The family will already have  cattle and  implements and  it  will not  be necessary  to  provide maintenance.   Though the standard of life of Arab and Jew  differ materially, no difference could be made either  in  the size of  holding allotted or  in  the amount granted for settlement.   If the Jew desires  a more liberal settlement,  and he will desire it,  clearly  he must obtain its costElsewhere than from the Development  Commission.
  Distribution  of  development  land. The  distribution  of  the developed land should be made to Jews whose names are borne onlists supplied to the Commission by the Jewish Agency, and  toArabs  named by  the  District  Commissioners.   The  claim  ofwould-be  settlers of both sections of the population should be  con-sidered simultaneously,  and the  Commission  must have the finaldecision on- the claims.  Co-operation  between Jewish  agencies  and  the  development commission. The scheme  proposed depends for its  success onloyal co-operation  of the  Jewish  Colonisation Agencies with theDevelopment  Commission.   The Commission  should  -be in  con-stant touch  with  those agencies, and  their  schemes  of develop-ment,  though intended  for  Jewish  settlement alone,  must he  so framed as to  fall in  with the scheme for the development  of thecountry as  a whole.    This is the only way in which  the  pro-visions of Article  6  of  the Mandate can  be observed and closesettlement of Jews on the land  encouraged while the position  of the:i other sections of the population are not affected.    There will doubtless  be  difficulties  at  the  commencement  in  co-ordinatingJewish plans  with  those of the Commission, but with  goodwill on either  side and a realization of the common  object those difficul-ties  should  be capable of resolution.  Artificial  inflation  of  land values. It is  also  only by co-opera-tion that  artificial  inflation  of  the price  of the  land will be  pre-vented.    At the  present time, the  price of  land in  Palestinehas  risen to  an exaggerated height, owing to the determination of the various Jewish purchasing agencies  to buy,  at  all hazardsand  at any  price, land  which  comes  into the  market,  and thefact  that  the owner  knows  that  if he  only holds, he  can get hisprice.   As the price of the land, or an adequate  percentage onthat price in the form of  rent must be collected from  the popula-tion to be  settled, the  scheme  will  fail  if  the land is boughtat an  unreasonable price, such as  the  present price.    It is  thusan essential  condition of  success that the  land  should be boughtat a reasonable  price and that the present fancy level of prices should be reduced.   This  is  only  possible  either  by agreementbetween  the  Government and  the Jewish purchasing  agencies,or by  Government control over dispositions of land.    The objectdesired might  be  attained  by  a  &quot; gentleman&apos;s  agreement &quot;between the Jewish Agency and the Commission.   Control, how-ever, would  be essential in  any  case in  order to prevent the in-cursion of third parties desirous of speculating in  land.  Ascertainment of  the number  of  landless Arabs. The  forth-coming census should be used in order  to ascertain the number  of arabs  who have become  landless.   It would also  be well  if  itcould  be  ascertained through  the Area  and District Officers, thenumber of  fellahin who have  not a holding on which they are able to maintain a  reasonable standard of life.   These two classes are dealt  with  by  Mr.  Snell  in  his  Note  of Reservations  to thereport  of  the  Commission on the Disturbances.  He says on page177 &quot; ....  Tile Arabs, on  the  other hand, should be secured in the possession of  sufficient land to provide him  with a  decentstandard  of  life .  .  . .  &quot; and on  p.  181, &quot;.....If  there arestill Arabs  who are  landless through the failure of the palestine government to apply administratively the  provisions of the HandLaws  in force in that country, steps should be taken by the Gov-ernment to settle them  on the  land at the public expense.....&quot;  Migration : Its difficulties. The task of a Development Corn-mission will not be easy.  It will involve,  among other problems,that of migration.    Evidently it will  not  be possible to increasethe  size of  a  fellah&apos;s holding in the Hills,  except by arrangement which will involve the  transfer of  some  other fellah  from the hills  elsewhere and the  use of the latter&apos;s holding  to increasethat of the former so as to  create  a  &quot;lot viable.&quot;     &quot; The process of  migration involves many  difficulties .... of which    not the least is the understandable objections  of the occupiers in the    neighbourhood of the new holding to immigrants being given land  to    which they consider they and  their families have a prior  claim.  Much    tact and foresight  are necessary in planning  migration  schemes and    inducing holders  to migrate to a part of  the country where the  local
    associations .... would be strange to them ....  Though  migration    formed  a  definite part of the policy of the late Congested  Districts    Board   in  dealing with  their  Estates ....  the  inherent  difficul-    ties  .... prevented a  development of the policy on a very extensive    scale ....   The now  almost universal scope  of land purchase  in    Saorstat Eireann makes it possible to.effect  more extensive  schemes of    migration.&quot;  The  above is a quotation  from the Eeport  of the  Irish LandCommissioners for  the  year ending  31st  March, 1929.    Thereis no doubt that similar difficulties  will be encountered in  any policy of  development which entails  migration as a consequence.In  the  case  of  the fellah, however,  the conditions under which&quot;he  lives are so unbearable that the difficulty of migration will notbe  felt  to the same degree.   He is always  migrating, even  atthe present time.    He goes to any  spot where he thinks he can find work.   Many of  them  have  left the  country altogether.Emigration of a similar nature is common both in Syria and  inIraq.  Relations  with  the Department  of Agriculture. The  relationsbetween a Development  Commission  and the existing Departmentof Agriculture will  require determination and definition.    Thereis danger both of  jealousy and overlapping.  Both of these dangersare inevitable.   The  object of both agencies is identical, namely,the improvement of the condition  of  the  smallholder.    If therelations between-een  the Commission and the High Commissioner areclose  and  cordial,  as must  be  the case if  the  scheme is to have full success, those between the Commission and the department should  not fail to be satisfactory.  Spheres of action  of the Development Commission  and Depart-ment of Agriculture. The broad principle  of division between thetwo agencies is the  following : It is  the duty  of the development commission  to  improve  the  land for the cultivator;  to  introduceirrigation  if  possible, to regulate the size  of the holding so  thatit shall be appropriate,  and to arrange for its occupation either by  migration of Arabs  already in the  country, or by the settle-ment of  Jews who have immigrated  under the auspices  of theJewish  organizations.     It  is  the  duty of the Department  ofAgriculture to look  after the technical side of  the cultivator&apos;s life,to provide him with education  and, if possible, training, to renderhim more  capable  than he is  at present to use the  improvedland to the  best advantage  when it is made available for him  bythe Development  Commission.  There will be border-line cases.   For instance, it is conceivable that  the  Development  Commission   may  establish   nurseriesto provide trees for the improved land.    The Department of Agri-culture  may also have nurseries to provide  trees for the cultivatorsgenerally.    But  by the application of ordinary common-sense,there should in practice be no difficulty in arranging  the spheres of action  of  the two authorities.  Hydrographic  Survey. It  has  been recommended  that  theGovernment should  institute a hydrographic survey of Palestine.This is  essential to satisfactory development of the country and tomethodical development of irrigation.   Meanwhile one of the firsttasks of the Commission  will be the examination of the  availablewater resources, in  order that  development may commence wherethere is the most  immediate  likelihood  of  success.  . They  willrequire  the services of the irrigation engineer of the Government forthis purpose.  Urgency of Irrigation Legislation  (Chapter  VII).- The  con-templated  legislation to  regulate  irrigation and to render it more efficient should be passed as soon as possible.  The control of  allirrigable water should remain with the Government,  and all surpluswater above  that  on which rights have been or may be establishedshould  be  its property.   It is regrettable that the Government hasin one case parted with the irrigation rights in  an important sourceto a concessionnaire, and steps should  be taken to  ensure that  inthat case  satisfactory arrangements are made for a supply of water for  irrigation at an early date.
  Formation of an Irrigation Department. It is not desirable thatthe irrigation services should be a branch  of the Agricultural De-partment and subject to the Director  of that Department.   Theyshould be constituted a separate service with a Department dealingonly with irrigation.  Occupancy  Right. The  question  of the creation of occupancyright of the agricultural tenant is discussed.  No measure short ofsuch right will suffice to secure the tenant against ejectment or theimposition of an excessive rental.  The bestowal of the right will,it is true, reduce the value of the property  on which the tenant issettled, but  it is essential that his tenure should be rendered moresecure than it is at the present time.  Legislation should be intro-dttced  as  soon as is possible  to confer that right,  which exists allover India,  on  the tenant  in  Palestine.   This legislation  shouldalso secure the tenant against increases in his rent except under theorders or with the sanction of the Court.  A register of all tenanciesmust be compiled in the course of the settlement now in progress.  Partition  of  Mesha&apos;a  (Chapter IV). The  tenure  in  commonknown as mesha&apos;a which prevails in nearly half of the Arab villagesof Palestine  has been described and  discussed, and it has been re-corded that  this system is  a great obstacle to any agricultural de-velopment of the country.   It is essential that steps should be takento partition the mesha&apos;a villages as soon as possible.  Acceleration  of  land  settlement  (Chapter  IV). It has been pointed out that the  maintenance of the record  of rights  which isnow being prepared,  and of a register of tenancies, is a necessarycondition of  good  administration of the agricultural tracts.  Thework of the settlement, which is extremely complicated, is  pro-ceeding very slowly, and it should be accelerated, if that is possible.If the delay is  due to the  expense of the settlement,  and the in-adeqttacy of the Settlement Budget,  that Budget  should  be in-creased.   The  work  is  so important to the Government  for its general purposes, and so essential to  activities of a development commission,  that  no avoidable delay  should be  tolerated.  Abolishment of imprisonment for debt (Chapter  VI). Imprison-ment for debt is an anachronism and should be  abolished.  Redistribution and. reduction of taxation (Chapter VI). Agricul-tural taxation is excessive  in Palestine at the present time.  TheTithe  is based on prices of  produce which have  fallen about 50 percent, since the  Tithe was commuted.   Until arrangements can bemade so to redistribute the  burden of taxation that it will fall morefairly  in accordance with the financial ability of the taxpayer, theTithe  should, if possible, be suspended.  If that is not possible, itshould vary  with the average market  price of produce.  The Greek Government, which  depended on  the Tithe as itsform of Agricultural  Taxation, has entirely abolished it with effect from the financial  year  1929-30.  Registration  fees Reduction  of  fees.--The  fees  at  presentcharged  for the  registration of  dispositions  of  land,  especially those  on  sale,  mortgage  and  succession,   are  so   high  asto  prevent  the  registration  of  changes  in  title   consequentthereon.  It is  desirable, in the interests of the maintenance of an accurate record of rights, that these fees should  be reduced.                          AGRICULTURE.  Co-ordination  of agricultural Scientific  Services (Chapter  VII,Section A). It is urgently necessarji that  steps should be taken toprevent  overlapping  between-een the  scientific  establishments  of  theGovernment, of the Jewish  Agency and of the Hebrew University.It is preferable, and would be more economical,  that the Govern-ment, rather than duplicate such services, should grant a subventionor should make payments for services rendered.  Increase of Department of Agriculture&apos;s Budget (Chapter VII). It is a question whether the Agricultural Department should main-tain certain  minor Services, as, for  instance, the Fisheries Serviceand the  Sericultural Service, with its present limited Budget.  Theexisting Budget is insufficient for the  work which the  AgriculturalDepartment should perform.  It  should be increased.
  D.emonstration plots  (Chapter VII). Of  all the agencies of  an agricultural department in a country of small-holders none is more valuable than the Demonstration Plot.  It is also one of  the most economical methods of  bringing practical  and  practicable  improve-ments to the notice of the peasant cultivator.   It is  suggested thatthis method might well be adopted by the Agricultural department in Palestine.  Distribution  of trees  (Chapter  VII). Another valuable  agency for improvement of the holding of the peasant  is the  distribution oftrees  either at cost price or below it.  Separation  of  the  Forest Service  (Chapter VII). The ForestService is not one which should be attached  to the Agricultural De-partment.   It should be constituted as an independent service.                           EDUCATION.  Increase  of Budget  of Department of Education. The educa-tional budget is by far too small for the requirements  of the country,and it is recommended that it should be increased.  Agricultural  course for Schoolmasters  (Chapter  VII). Agricul-tural  development  is  dependent on the spread  of elementary educa-tion.   It is desirable  that all village schoolmasters should be given a six months&apos; course at an agricultural school, and that the curriculumof  the village school  should  include elementary instruction  in agri-culture.  Each village school should have a small  plot of land whichwill  serve  as  a  school  garden  and  demonstration  plot.   Thereshould be close co-operation  between the Departments of education and of Agriculture.                          CO-OPEBATION.   Encouragement of co-operation between Arab and Jew in OrangeIndustry.   (Chapter VII,  Section D.) -The  Jewish  Communitiesare very well served by a series of efficient Co-operative  Societies.It  woidd be to the general advantge of the country if these societiesor  such of them as are suitable for the purpose,  could be madeavailable to Arab members.  It  would be  of special value if  the orange grading and  packing Society  &quot; Pardess &quot;, could  enlist  theArab orange-growers into its membership.    Constitution  of  Co-operative Credit Societies. The constitution of Co-operative  Credit Societies among the fellahin is an essential preliminary to  their advancement.   The whole  question is being examined at the  present  time,  by Mr. Strickland,  on  behalf of the Palestine Government..                   AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT.    Government  acquisition  of  the Huleh Concession.   (Chapters  I and  VII,  Section C.) If  the  Huleh  Concession falls in, the land should be retained by the Government for Development purposes. This area is one of  the most  fertile in the whole of Palestine  and a  large number of families could be provided for on  a comparatively small developed area.    Limitation of orange cultivation.   (Chapter VIII, Section (a).)  The area under the  orange is increasing with very great rapidity. It appears doubtful  whether the market will be able to  digest the amount of fruit which will be produced at  the end  of the next  five years, when all groves now planted will be in bearing.   Generally there is an optimistic  spirit among the growers,  but it would seem to be the  path of wisdom to  await  the result of the recent rapid extension before continuing to extend  the area.    Development of other fruit crops.   (Chapter VIII, Sections-(b),  (c),  (e), (/).) Attempts should be made to encourage the cultiva- tion  of other fruits  and valuable crops, rather than to depend en- tirely on one crop.  The  grape fruit offers  good prospects.   The Palestine fruit is excellent and it grows in soil  which is too heavy for  the orange.  The prospects for  the  banana  do not appear bright, but  attempts  should  be made  to  develop  the markets in Eastern Europe.
  Import duty on melons in Egypt.   (Chapter VIII, Section (d).) The Egyptian Government has placed, an import duty on Pales-palestinian melons which is likely to restrict the trade.  The DamascusMunicipality has impose an octroi duty on the same fruit.  Improvement of grades of tobacco.   (Chapter VIII, Section (g).)- Efforts should be made to foster the cultivation of a better gradeof  tobacco,  experts  in  manipulation  and in packing being  em-ployed to teach the cultivators.  There is every  prospect that high quality  tobacco  could be  grown in  Palestine,   ft  is  probablyadvisable that,  at least for the present, the cultivation of tobaccoshould be restricted to the northern part of the country, where the better qualities  of leaf can be grown.  Amendment of minimum area of  tobacco.   (Chapter  VIII) There is no good reason for the present  rule, which prevents the cultivation of tobacco on an area of less than two dunams.  It wouldbe  sufficient if  the  area were restricted to a minimum of half adunam.   The interest of the  cultivators  should  be considered, aswell  as that of the  manufacturer in framing legislation governing the cultivation of tobacco.  Improvement  of   quality  of  olive  oil  and  pruning of  trees.(Chapter VIII, Section (h).) Steps should  be taken to teach thecultivator the method of producing Olive Oil of better quality thanthat  now manufactured by the small  grower.   It would also bean  advantage that  instructors in pruning olive trees should beemployed to tour the  country and to teach the peasants the correctmethod  of pruning their trees.  Steps  to revive the barley export trade.   (Chapter VIII, Section(?).) The question  of the  export  trade in Barley deserves  con-sideration.   That trade, which was  of a certain  importance beforethe war, has not revived  since the Armistice.  The reason  for itsfailure to revive should  be  examined,  and  the  purchase  of  acleaning plant  again considered.   Encouragement   of  sericulture  and  production   of   honey. (Chapter VIII, Section  (k).) If serious  efforts are contemplatedto  this end  it is necessary to make a more adequate  provision inthe budget on their account than is done at present.   Possibility of a  canning  industry  for  dairy produce.   (Chapter VIII, Section  (I).) The local  market  for  dairy  products  is cir- cumscribed  and it  will  soon be  unable  to  dispose of the  dairy products of  the country.   Prices are already- falling.   It  is neces- cary  that an attempt  should  be  made to  cultivate  the foreign market  for  dairy produce.  The possibility  of a canning  industry for dairy products,  and of the manufacture of cheese for  export should be examined.    Palestinian industry.   (Chapter IX.) The larger  manufaetur- ing  industries  are  dependent  on- the protection  afforded by  theimport  tariff.  It  is questionable  whether in  certain cases  the protective tariff is  justified by the  results. In  the  case  of  the cement   industry,   the  tariff  appears  to have  been raised  un- necessarily.    Reduction of excise on wines.  (Chapters  VIII, Section  (/) and IX.) The wine-industry is very heavily taxed  in licence  fees and Excise  duty, which  are passed  on to the grape  growers.  These already pay  the ordinary agricultural taxes, tithe and werko.  In view of the present agricultural depression  it  would  be  advanta- geous, if possible, to reduce these taxes.    The  smaller manufacturing industries  are succeeding  in many cases.   This type of  industry seems specially suited to  the country.    Position of industries.   (Chapter  IX.) There is not any reason to believe that Palestine offers special attractions to large industrial concerns.  The industries likely to succeed are those that are based on local products or,  being based on  imported products, show- special vitality.  It would  be a  speculation  dangerous to the  economic future of the country,  if an  attempt were made to start a textile industry in Palestine on a large scale.    Encouragement   of   Arab   industries.   (Chapter  IX.) Indi- genous  Arab industries exist and should  be encouraged.    Preparation  of  Labour Immigration  Schedules.  (Chapter X.) - It is  recommended that in  the future  the Labour  Immigration Schedules should be prepared by the  representatives of the  Jewish
Agency and of the Immigration  Department in consultation, withthe help  of non-official  persons acquainted  with  the  economic position oi&apos; Palestine, as, for instance, leading bankers.  Immigration officer at towns abroad.   (Chapter X.) The exist-ing system  has  certain weaknesses.   It is  suggested  that a repre-sentative  of the Immigration  Department  should be stationed at each  of  the  towns  whence  immigration  to  Palestine  is  mostcommon.  Expulsion of  illicit  immigrants.   (Chapter X.) Proposals  aremade, that in  the case of illicit entry into Palestine, the entrantshould invariably be returned to  the country whence he came,  andthat in the case of &quot; pseudo-travellers &quot;  unless  there are reasons to the contrary, the same procedure should follow detection.  Registration   of   Unemployment   and   Labour  Exchanges.(Chapter  X.) The  whole question of Arab unemployment should form  the subject of study and steps should be taken to create amachinery  for  the registration of Arab  unemployment.  Govern-ment  Employment  Exchanges should be  created&quot;, without whichdetermination of the number of Arab  unemployed is not possible.  If  there  are  Arab  workmen  unemployed it  is not right  thatJewish workmen from foreign countries  should be imported to fillexisting vacant  posts.   Constitution  of a separate Department  of Immigration, travel and Labour. The Immigration Office, which is now a section ofthe   Police  Department,   should   be  constituted  a   separateDepartment.   Part of expenditure  of Development Commission  recoverable- -Both  the-expenditure  necessary for the purchase of land in  con-nection with  a Development Commission, and the  expenditure ofthe Commission itself are largely in the nature of outlay which willin  time be repaid.  Its outlay is in the  nature of reproductiveexpenditure.  Of the advances for Development, 85  per cent, to 90per  cent,  should prove recoverable.   Intensive development of rural Palestine essential. In  closingthis  Report I  desire  to record  my  opinion that the observance of  the Articles of the Mandate, and specially of Article 6 of theMandate, presents extraordinary difficulty.  The  sole way in whichthe Mandate can be  carried out  is by the intensive development of rural  Palestine.  It will  not be  sufficient to develop a small portion.   The  unique  condition  of success is the development of the whole, which, as has been said before, is a  task requiring not only years of work, but also serious  expenditure. There exists no easy method of carrying out the provisions of the Mandate. Develop- ment is the only way.   Without development, there  is not room for a single  additional settler,  if the standard of life  of the fellahin is  to be raised  so that it  shall  permit reasonable conditions of livelihood to  that backward class of the community.   The introduction of settlers  possible if development carried out.- It is my personal  belief, founded on the  enquiries which I  have made and  on my personal inspections, that with thorough develop- ment of  the  country there  will he room, not  only for all the present agricultural population&apos; on a higher standard of life  than it at present enjoys, but for not less than 20,000  families of settlers from outside.   Necessity of joint endeavour. Any scheme for development pre- sents  serious  difficulties.  Unless such a  scheme  is accepted  by both Jew  and  Arab it may very well fail.   Of both it will require the support if it is to have the desired result, namely, the advarice- ment  of a neglected  but historic country in the path of modern efficiency, by  the joint endeavour of the  two great sections of its population, with the assistance  of the Mandatory Power.
