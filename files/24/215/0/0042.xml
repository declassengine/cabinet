I circulate herewith a  memorandum by the  ForeignOffice on the views set out b.v. the First  Lord  of  the Admiralty inFaper 0.P.331(30) regarding the problem of  the reservation of belligerent rights in connection with the conclusion of an arbitration Treaty with the United States .Foreign 0fil.ee,     October  14th, 1930.mm
Memorandum by the Foreign Office ,471     The question of belligerent righto in connection withan arbitration treaty with the United States is quite differentiv-om the question of belligerent rights in relation to otherMembers of the League, which was discussed in connection withour signature of the Optional Clause, and the argumentsWhioh were then used are not applicable to the position whichwe now have to consider ,   So long as the United States- remainsoutside the. League and free froiti the obligations of Article 16,we have to consider the possibility of our being engaged in awar in whioh the United States may be concerned to uphold the traditional rights of neutrals ,     It should be emphasised that sueh difference of opinion &quot;asexists with the Admiralty relates only to methods and not toaims.   We are both anxious to preserve our belligerent rights to the fullest extent possible, since action -under Article 1.6may involve-a olaim to intercept enemy-commerce to an even greater extent than we have ever done in the past.   The only question whioh now arises is whether this object is more likelyto- be furthered or hindered by an attempt to exclude belligerentrights frcm the operation of an arbitration treaty with the                                         united - States .                          .&apos;-     /This question was.-disoxissed at  length under the late^Government, and it is as true  now as  it was then that  &quot;at best&apos;&quot;it. is a choice of evils that  the Committee of  Imperial Defence                                4&quot;and the Cabinet have to make&quot;.   The  arguments on both sidesare  set  out in paragraphs  3-5-43  of  the  report  of  a  sub-e-ommitteewhioh  then cat  (pp.  15-16  of  0.P.535/30)  and  it  ia not desiredto-repeat them here .    But&apos; it  is suggested that the  events  whifdihave  occurred sinoe  the - suh-^rrunittee reported have/
  somewhat diminished the -/eight to bo attached - to- the arguments  of the minority.       The successful conclusion of the Faval Treaty has removed.  one possible cause of friction between the two countries,  and  our relations are at the moment considerably better than they  were in February,-, 1^29.    V/ith the settlement of the cruiser  question-until 1936.  one source of difficulty which might  at  any time have brought the. quest i on .nf belligerent  rights to  the fcro has been,  at any  rote,  tomporarily, .-removed.    moreover, .w3..-hava- some reason to belieVe that the American Ilsvy  Department  have now realised  that a whittling down  of belligarent rights  would  not be in their  own  interests and have definitely  express-ed the opinion  that a  discussion of the question is  to-  be avoided,     If  this is  so,  it  would seem,  notwithstanding the  fact  that the question wus mentioned  in the conversations  between Mr.  MacDonald  and President Hoover,  fairly  safe to  assume that  the United States Government  have  no desire to  raise  the  question if it  can be  avoided.    And  the  longer it can  bo  allowed  to sleep the better from  our  point of  view,  if only  for  tho reason  th-..t  time is required  to enable America.:, opinion  to realise the  fundamental change  in  the  position which has-  been  effected  by the Kellogg Pact,  and to  baoomo used  to the  idea that it  will be impossible for the United States  to tale  an  entirely  detached at  itudo in  the  event  of  a  breach  of that  tr eat;/.      Put  it  seems to be  certain that  the  one thing  which would  inevitably revive this question would be  an attempt  on  our  part  to  exclude belligerent rights from the scope  of an  arbitration treaty &quot;.&apos;hethnr or not  any such  exclusion were accepted  by  the  American negotiators and the Senate (and it may be  doubted whether either  could accept it once the que  tion were raisadx)  the result  mustx. IlTTs^understood that a desire to ensure the arbitration  of anysuch question was one reason why Mr. Kellogg omitted the vital interests&quot; clause from his&apos; draft treaty.                             -2-
surely bo a revival of tho agitation  in the United  States..vhich it is essential for us  to  avoid  if  possiblee    If  thishappens, y.e may lose the benefits  of  all  that  has been donsduring the last tv;o years;  not  only  vould the  general rela-tlons of the tyro countries be  impaired but  the developmentof American thought in relation  to the implications of the he Hogg Pact \. ou Id be checked - and when it, becomes  necessaryto resume naval discussions   in  preparation  for 1936,  1 e may find that re have to do so in a  much  deteriorated atmosphere.It is even possible that the United States might find  itimpossible to escape taking action in the direction of cali-Ing 3 conference to draft a code of belligerent rights at sea,and. from the point of vie-/-- of  tine  maintenance  of those rights the calling of such a conference in such  an  atmosphere may beregarded as the s:orst thing that could happen.          It is these considerations  which lead the Foreign Officeto conclude that the balance  of  advantage lies  on the  side ofnot attempting to exclude belligerent  rights from any  treatyvhich may be concluded,    It  is  recognised that if  this  is done it may lead to a discussion of the question  in this country andpossibly in Parliament, but as to  this It. may be observed(l) that our case for resisting  an attack on these  lines Ismuch strengthened by tho majority  report  of  the lateGovernment1s sub-committee, and  (2) that  a discussion  on this side of the Atlantic should be lass harmful  than one on  thoother,          On the general question  of  the uiid.esirabi.lity  of goingto arbitration i;ith the United States  on  a question oi&apos; belli-gerent rights,  it is not desired to comment  in  detail  on theobservatioij.s of tho Naval Staff, hut  there is  one observationv:hich should be made.   The real danger from our point
sf view is not so much the possibility of arbitration of thisquestion, but of a situation arising in which the United states were to challenge our exercise rf these rights.  The one thing,failing American entry into the League, which should diminish the possibility of such a situation arising is that developmentof American thought in relation to the Kellogg pact to which reference has been made above, and which is likely&apos;to be checked by the raising of the belligerent rights issue at thepresent time.  Moreover, if such a situation did. arise, thedanger is not so much a demand, by the United States for arbitration, but action on their part, suoh as a refusal toallcw us to draw essential supplies or financial assistancefeom America, which might really prove fatal to our cause.It is even possible that in such circumstances we might find it desirable or necessary, as we did during the great war, tomake an offer of arbitration  as the best means of staving offany such action cn their part.          Per these reasons it is felt that if it do^s become necessary to make the choice, it will be preferable net toattempt to exclude this particular question from the scope ofthe treaty.  But it is submitted that  every effort should Iremade to avoid getting into a  position where the choice has tobe made.  We might, for instance, explore the possibility of substituting for the arbitration treaty proposed by Mr. Kellogga treaty providing for improved methods of settlement  of disputeby conciliation, etc., a reference to  judicial settlement being-retained for rases where both sides agree that such a method would be the most appropriate.  The question  is cne as to whichthe views of the Dominions, and especially of  Canada, may quitepossibly. Ire  ox  considerable assistance, and it would bepr-eforablo--iir-the---ffret -instance to have a full discussion with                           - A
them at the Arbitration and Disarmament Committee cf theimperial Conference.  But it is suggested that theDominions should be informed that, in the last resort, theviews ef His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomcire as indicated above.FOREIGN OFFICE.13th Oot iber, 1930 .
