TO RFIPLACE  THE ROOT-BRYCE TREATY Off 1908.            ivIMvIORANSUivl  by  t:^ SECRETLY OF^ s TATE FOR                      doki^io^ affairs.            I circulate herewith a note  On the memorandum       by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs regarding       the United States&apos;  proposals  for  an arbitration treaty       to replace the Root-Bryce Treaty  of 1908 circulated       in Paper CP.   33.5 (30).                                    (ltd)   J.H.T.rominions Office,    13th October,  1930..L._BBH&amp;
United States proposals for an arbitration Treaty to           replace the Root-Bryoo Treaty ox 1908.      The  policy proposed by  the  Secretary oi&apos;  State  for Foreign Affairs for  consideration at  the  Imperial Conference  is  as follows:-      (a)  To make no  move unless  the United States&apos; Government  should revert to  the  matter.      (b)  If the United States  should  make a move, to suggest that they ohouid sign  the Optional Clause.      (c)  If  the United States  should,  as  is probable, reject such a  proposal,  to accept a draft treaty first communicated to us at  the end  of 1927,  subject  to certain necessary formal amendments, and one  other amendment  of  a material  character (see  below.)      It should be explained  that the  draft Treaty proposed by  the United  States in 1927 provided for arbitration cf  justiciable disputes  of all kinds  subject  to certain specified exceptions (see iirticle 2 on page 5 of E(B) (30) 9)  which  did not include belligerent  rights at  sea.      The  amendments  referred to  above  relate  to      (1)  those necessary to  meet the  constitutional position  of the JC-minions;      (2)  those necessary to  secure that the various parts of  tne British umpire  have a right equivalent to the  right of  the United  States Senate  to approve  or reject any special agreement settling the terms  of reference for the submission to  arbitration of any particular case under the  treaty.      I see no  objection  to this  procedure being put&quot;forward for discussion at the  Imperial  Conference but the following points occur to me:-      (a)  It has been  suggested  that  Canada should provide the  Chairman of the  Committee  on arbitration  and Disarmament and it will  be remembered  that  Canada, under the  last  (Liberal) Government, locked  upon  herself as the
champion of the principle  of  arbitration.  It is at anyrate net unlikely that Canada, may have, proposals of&quot; her ownto make.     (b)     mentioned above, the proposed proceduredoes net provide for the exclusion from arbitration of questions arising from the exercise  of belligerentrights at sea.  AS will be seen from the statement ofthe views expressed by the Dominions in 1928--9 which.is contained in Appendix III  to Annex I to tho foreign secretary fs memorandum (ii. (B) (30)9)  His majesty&apos;governments in Canada, the Commonwealth of Australiaand the Union of South Africa at that time assumed that,in any arbitration treaty with the United States, some special provision for dealing with the question of belligerent rights would be required and, if no suohprovision is new proposed, it will be necessary toexplain to these Governments  the reasons why ouch aprevision is not thought necessary.  It is also known that His Majesty1s Government in New Zealand have hithertsattached considerable importance to  the exclusion of ques-tions of belligerent rights from arbitration.  In the courseof correspondence last year as to acceptance of the optional Clause (where the position  as to disputes arisingfrom the exercise of belligerent rights was safeguardadby a provision enabling us to refer  any dispute  to theCouncil of the League before  /
before submitting it to the Permanent Court)  the New zealand government enquired &quot;what action it is proposed to take tosafeguard this question of belligerent rights in framing theproposed Anglo-American arbitration&apos; treaty &quot;in view...of-thefact that the United.- States will certainly not agree to referdisputes to the League of nations Council.&quot;   The replyreturned to this enquiry was &quot;The question of the Anglo-American Arbitration Treaty has not yet been considered byHis Majesty1s Government in the United Kingdom, and indeed its consideration has been deliberately postponed until agreement has been reached concerning the Optional Clause .   We feelthat the situation has been modified by the Pact of Peacesince we may legitimately hope that the risk of the UnitedStates claiming right of unrestricted trade with violator ofthat pact is much reduced.   It may be further modified if asatisfactory agreement is reached as to naval disarmament andif all feeling of naval competition is thereby removed .   if in fact the point you raise should create a difficulty, wethink it could be solved by the operation of the Bryan Treatyof 1912&quot;.          It seems clear that the Mew Zealand Government,before they will be prepared to agree to enter into anyarbitration treaty with the United States which contains noreservation covering questions of belligerent rights, willrequire to be satisfied that no risk is Involved by theabsence of any such reservation.          It will be remembered that in the White Paper on the signature by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomof tbe Optional Clause  (Cmd r 3852) the question of the positioncreated by the acceptance of the Optional  Clause In relation tor- T^J -*
the legitimacy of British belligerent action at sea was discussed, and that the view was there expressed that the signing of the Optional Clause would not hamper our exercise &apos;of belligerent rights because it was only necessary toconsider .the contingency of another -member of the Leaguebringing our naval action before the Permanent Court underthe Optional Clause, and in no circumstances would thiscountry be involved in war except in accordance with theprovisions of the Covenant of the League ,   In other words-,as between members of the League there can be no neutralrights because there can be no neutrals ,,   This argumentwould, of course, not apply to an arbitration treaty withthe United States or ever to the position which would arise if the United States signed the Optional Clause .      (c)  As will be seen from Appendix III to Annex I tothe memorandum by the Secretary of State for F&apos;oreign Affairs,His Majesty1s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia in1923  suggested that, in any arbitration treaty with theUnited States, there shoiiid be a reservation in respeot of disputes which &quot;depend upon or involve any question affectingrelations of any parts of the British Empire with regions inwhich the British Empire, according to its traditionalattitude, has special interests.&quot;   The proposals now putforward contain no provision of this nature.   It is not known whether the present Commonwealth Government wouldattach importance to this matter, but, even If the point Isnot raised by the Commonwealth Government, it may verypossibly be raised by the Few Zealand Government .      (d)  It should be added that it is by no means certainthat  all the Dominions would agree to the form of treaty at
present contemplated, namely one signed on behalf of  all parts of the Empire, and that some Dominions might prefer to negotiate their own separate treaties 0   In the course ofthe correspondence in 1928-9, His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe Irish Free State definitely took this view and inti-mated that they were considering the desirability of negotiating a separate arbitration treaty with the UnitedStates .   So far as is known, no progress has been madewith such negotiations bit the possibility of the Irish FreeState adopting the same attitude In the present connectionmust not be overlooked *
