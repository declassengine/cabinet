EMPIRE MIGRATION.          I circulate for the information of my colleaguesa memorandum on the subject of the Report of the Committeeon Empire Migration appointed by the Economic AdvisoryCouncil (Paper No. O.P. 329 (30).          The terms of this memorandum have been agreed between the Dominions Office, the Treasury and theMinistry of Labour.                     (Intialled)  J.E.T.Dominions Office .S.W.1.  14th October,  1930.
1.        As a preliminary to a general review of migration policy a Committee of the Economic AdvisoryCouncil was appointed last July     &quot;to consider the question of migration from the      United Kingdom to oversea parts of the Empire      in its economic aspects, (a) In the immediate      future, And (b) over a longer period, and to      advise whether Government action to stimulate      such migration is economically or otherwise      desirable.&quot;2.        The Committee have recently presented an interim Report, but this does not profess to dealwith the economic aspects&quot;of migration, which questionis reserved for the Committee&apos;s Final Report;  andthe Final Report is not likely to be presentedbefore the close of the Imperial Conference.3,        Pending receipt and consideration of theFinal Report, his Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom will not wish to commit themselves definatly to any specific measures for stimulating migration orto any specific change of migration policy.4.        Moreover, the atmosphere for thediscussion of migration at the present ImperialConference is not likely to be favourable to theUnited Kingdom.  His Majesty&apos;s Governments in theDominions cniefly interested in migration (viz.Canada, Australia and New Zealand) have found itnecessary, owing to the present economic depression,
to restrict assisted migration very considerably.They are at present seriously concerned with theproblem of finding work for their own unemployed.The Dominion delegates will feel bound to considerthe state of public opinion in their own Countries,and this, in times of depression, is alwaysadverse to immigration.   In these circumstancesthey will almost certainly be unwilling to committheir Governments definitely to co-operation inany concrete proposals for stimulating migration,either now or when timos are better.   And itwould in any event be a mistake of tactics forHis hajesty&apos;s Government in the united Kingdom toenter on firm negotiations with the Dominionsfor future financial and other co-operation inthe encouragement of migration at a time when,owing to depression and unemployment, immigrationhappens to be unpopular everywhere.5.        Accordingly, it is very desirable thatthe United Kingdom delegates at the ImperialConference should confine themselves to a discussion of Oversea Settlement in general termsonly.6.        There are, however,, two suggestions which will have to be carefully considered inthe United Kingdom Government^ review of futuremigration policy and on which all the Departmentsconcerned are agreed that it would be desirable,if possible, to ascertain the views of theDominion delegates.
7.     TheRe suggestions, which accord with-the views expressed in the Interim Report of the migration Committee of the Economic AdvisoryCouncil, are as follows      (a)  That the provision of reduced, ocean           passage rates for bona fide migrants           should he extended with a view to           encouraging persons to migrate at their           own expense and on their own responsibilityj      (b)  That.greater reliance should be placed on           on selected Voluntary  Societies, approved           by the United Kingdom and Dominion           Governments, for the selection and           assistance of suitable migrants who have           not the means to migrate entirely at           their own expense.8.     For Canada&apos;, a reduced ocean rate of  10(against the ordinary third-class fare of  18.15.0)has been available since 1st January, 1929s for allbona fide migrants.   Experience has shown that, ingeneral, persons migrating at their own expense andon their own responsibility, including those taking advantage of the  10 rate to Canada, have made more satisfactory settlers than those directly assisted.Moreover their acceptance &quot;by the Dominions is not subject to the detailed, and frequently embarrassingcontrol v/hica the Dominion Governments exorciseover assisted migration.   The Canadian Governmentwelcomed the  10 rate arrangement.
9,     &apos;jnd for migrants in need of financialassistance it. has &quot;been found more satisfactory inevery way that they should be dealt with by-suitable and efficient Voluntary Societies working  .-under United Kingdom Government control than by governments direct.10.    The  10 rate for Canada was secured by arrangement with the British ITorth AtlanticSteamship Lines, and it involve&apos;3 a contribution bythe United Kingdom Government of  4.7.6. per migrant.the other half of the roducwioneclow the ordinarythird-class fare being borne by the ShippingCompany.   Any further reduction of that rate, andany reduction of the existing rate to Australiaand New Zealand, could be obtained only by agreementwith the Shipping Companies concerned.  - Theconcurrence of the Shipping Companies in any reduction of rates that might be desired could notbe assumed.   Quite apart from the -question of theamount of the per capita contribution that would berequired, the Companies would have to considerinter alia possible reactions on non-migrant rates.11.    Accordingly, it will not be possible to specify any particular reduced rates in the diecuesionwith the Dominion delegates, but ideally, and apartfrom tho question of division of cost, the rates should be low enough to make it possible for thebulk of the migrants to proceed overseas withoutother assistance and yet not so low that theDominion Governments would not feel able to  regardpersons paying them sxn free from all
immigration control not normally imposed on fullfare paying passengers.12.       To obtain the maximum advantage from enlistingthe services of the Voluntary Societies for the selection and assistance of persons unable to migrate without special assistance it would be necessary to secure  the assent of the Dominion Governments to the exercise  ofa general rather than a detailed control over this  migra-tion, e .g. to allow the Societies to send out such  migrantsas they could undertake to place and look after untilsatisfactorily settled .13,       It Is hardly likely that the Dominion Govern-ments would be prepared to forego detailed control  ofassisted migration through Voluntary Societies if theywere asked to bear a share of the cost of providing thefinancial assistance,   And it is extremely unlikely thatthe Voluntary Societies would be able to put up more money for assisting migrants than they do at present.Accordingly it is almost certain that it would not  bepossible in times of migration activity to obtain themaximum advantage from the greater use of the VoluntarySocieties without a greater measure of financial assistancefrom the United Kingdom Government.   This would almost certainly necessitate an amendment of the provision inthe Empire Settlement Act, 1922, which limits the UnitedKingdom Governments contribution to 50 per cent, of thecost of any scheme.
14 .       Similarly it would be necessary that thatlimitation should be removed before any further reduction could be made in the migrant rate to Canada unless theShipping Companies would think it worth while to bear halfthe cost .   For political reasons the Canadian Governmentrefused to contribute towards the  10 rate (the cost ofwhich is shared equally by the United Kingdom Governmentand the Shipping Companies) and. they would be certain torefuse to contribute to any further reduction&quot;&quot;&quot;.   TheAustralian and Few Zealand Governments however have hither-to borne half the cost of assisted migration, and prima facie they might be expected to she re equally with theUnited Kingdom Government the cost of a reduced ocean rate,but it could, not be taken for certain that they would be willing to do so and at the same time give persons paying the reduced rate the same freedom of entry as full farepaying passengers.- 6 -Canada does not draw its immigrants wholly fromtbis country - on average the proportion is rather more than 2/5 - and on racial and other grounds,objections are raised in certain quarters in theDominion to spending Canadian money on encouragingBritish immigration.   This opposition at timesseriously embarrasses the Canadian Government, and often leads to hampering restrictions .   In thesecircumstances it has been found by experience thatthe less the Canadian Government contributes towardsfacilitating British migration the better.
15.    The 50:50 limitation of tho Empire SettlementAct has the great advantage of safeguarding theExchequer against extravagant demands, and the questionof Its removal would require the most serious consideration.It would be necessary to c onsider in what way, and to what extent financially, the Dominions would be willing toco-operate in facilitating a freer movement of migrantson the lines indicated above, and In particular whetherthe Canadian Government would be prepared to give a preference to the admission of migrants from the UnitedKingdom over those from foreign countries.   It wouldalso be necessary to consider the Final Report of the migration Committee of the Economic Advisory Council.16.      It is, therefore, proposed that the discussions with the Dominion delegates should be on an exploratory-basis only, and that the  United Kingdom Government shouldnot be definitely committed to action on the lines of(a) and (b) In paragraph  7 above.   It is particularly important chat the Government should not be committed toremoving the 50:50 limitation in the Empire SettlementAct .17.   There, are several matters of less importance whichthe Oversea  Settlement desire to have discussed at  theImperial Conference, but  discussion would be entirely onan exploratory basis,  and without committing the UnitedKingdom Government to  any change of policy or any amendment of the Empire Settlement Act.IB.      There is  one  member  which will have  to  bedi scus sed  w 11h the  Australian delegates, viz:   the  5 .million Agreement  with  the  Commonwealth Government,  whichwas  arranged  in  1925.   The  object of this Agreement was
to secure an  increasing  number  of  assisted migrantsto Australia  through  the promotion of developmentworks of all  descriptions,  including land settlement..The works wore to be  financed from loans  raised bythe Commonwealth government, and the United KingdomGovernment wore to  contribute as a free grant  20*of the loan expenditure  -  approximating to halfche loan interest for 10 years.    The Agreement has given rise to many  difficulties, end although  theUnited Kingdom Government  have  paid no less thanSi,206,000 it is impossible to  prove that this expenditure has resulted,  or will  result, in any appreciable increase  in  the flow of migrants to theDominion.   The benefits  of an  agreement  of this nature are apt to be  rendered Ineffective by unwiseaction on the part&apos;of the  Dominion Government  inother directions over which, tho United Kingdom Governmenthave no control.    No schemes under the Agreement  havebeen approved by the  United Kingdom Government  sincethe Commonwealth Government decided a year ago  to suspend assisted migration, and It is desirable, ifpossible, that the  agreement (which would not  In theordinary course expire until 1935) should, now  be terminated by mutual  consent except as regards  thecompletion of  schemes already approved.    In any event it should, it Is suggested,  be made clear tothe Australian delegates  that the  United  KingdomGovernment would, feel the  utmost difficulty in considering further participation  in the  Agreement,Dominions Offlce,       October  1930.
