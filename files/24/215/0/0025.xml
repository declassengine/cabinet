    Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.          As my colleagues know, the Commander-in-Chief in india is a Member of the Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council which isin fact what is popularly known as the &quot;Government of India&quot;.The opinion has been expressed with great authority on morethan one occasion in the past, e.g. by the Esher Committee, and quite recently again by the Indian Statutory Commission thatthe practice of making the Commander-in-Chief a Member of theExecutive Council should be terminated;  it is an arrangement which, though it is recognised as a probable contingency by thepresent Government of India Act, is not statutorily required.          My own view, which is that expressed by the authorities -I have quoted and others and which has not seriously beendisputed on the merits, is that the tenure of the Commander-in-Chief should be divorced from the tenure of a seat on theCouncil as soon as possible.  The question to be considered iswhen this should be done.          General Sir Philip Chetwode, the Commander-in-Chief-designate, is about to take up his duties in India and itwould.seem at first glance tha^t the beginning of the tenure of the new Commander-in-Chief offers the opportunity to alter the existing&apos; practice.  In actual fact to take the step now would be to pre-judge any recommendation on the subject bythe Round Table Conference (and still more the enactment of it into law) which, though it may be regarded asa.foregone conclusionnevertheless has not yet been made.                      -          Moreover, the Commander-in-Chief obviously cannot be                                                  removedHIS D0CIIENT-JS-THE-PROEBRTY .03?

Copy Ho.                       CABINET.                                r         The Position of the Commander-in-Chief  in India on            the  Governor-^General&apos; s  Executive Council.
                                                         338                                                        2.removed from the Governor General&apos;s Council without  arrangements being made to secure the due representation in the Council ofmilitary questions and it is probable that a new and highly paid membership of Council would have to be created.        I therefore do not propose to take any action  at themoment, more particularly as Sir Philip Chetwode, though he isto my knowledge well aware that the change in question may take place before his tenure of the Command-in-Chief expires,no doubt accepted the offer of the Connahd-in-Chief  on thetacit understanding that he is also, at the beginning  at anyrate, to be a member of the Governor General&apos;s ExecutiveCouncil.  I propose therefore, if my colleagues approve, to write to Sir Philip and inform him that I propose to submit to His Majestjr (by whom the appointment to the Council is aadeand during whose pleasure it is held) that he be appointed tothe Council but on the understanding that his appointment mayhave to be terminated before his tenure as Commander-in-Chiefexpires, either as the result of legislation or even as theresult of administrative action if the change is no generallyrecommended as to make this desirable.       I should also like my colleagues, in agreeing to thisproposal, to register an opinion that the Government retainsits freedom to carry out at once by administrative act,, afterof course the necessary consultation with the Government ofIndia, any changes in the mechanism of the government  of thatcountry which in the light of the Round Table Conference appeart&amp; them desirable and do not require legislation - withoutnecessarily waiting for a complete scheme, involvingadministrative as well as legislative changes,  to be presented as a whole to Parliament.                         W.B.4-th October 1930.
