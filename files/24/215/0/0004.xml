                             INTRODUCTORY.     1.  The first part of the first head of the Agenda stands as follows :          Inter-Imperial trade, including            (1) general review of progress of trade of Empire over a term of years,      and any matters arising  therefrom ; including  capital  investments  and      establishment of branch industries, the  effect  of successive tariff changes      in  its constituent  parts and  extent  and  effect of inter-Imperial  tariff      preferences and also of other factors, e.g., cartels, etc.;           (2) the work of and any questions arising in connection with (a) Imperial      Economic Committee, (6) Empire Marketing  Board,  (c)  Imperial Institute.     It is expected  that under  this heading considerable discussion will arise on methods to be pursued in  the  future for the promotion of inter-Imperial trade.Such a  discussion is highly desirable, and the time seems favourable for taking a real step in advance.  The need for a close examination of inter-Imperial economic relations is  equally emphasised in the Report of the Preparatory Committee,representative of the Association of Chambers of Commerce, the Federation ofBritish  Industries and the  Chamber of Shipping of the United  Kingdom, in theReport of the Economic Committee of the Trade Union Congress, in the Reportof the Economic Advisory  Council  and in the resolutions of the Congress of theFederation of Chambers of  Commerce of the British Empire.                                  Part I.                       IMPERIAL TRADE  POLICY.    2.  Inter-Imperial  trade should  be understood  to cover not  merely trade between the United Kingdom on the one hand and  the rest of the Empire on theother hand but also trade between the various parts of the Empire.  It is important not to convey the  impression that we are  interested only in the  former.   Thelatter should also be encouraged because all inter-Imperial  trade is directly bene-ficial to some parts of  the Empire and serves indirectly to strengthen the Empire.Moreover, and in particular after the Imperial Conference of 1926,  expressionswhich might be taken  to imply a conception of the Empire as a system with theUnited Kingdom as a unique centre and the Dominions and India grouped aroundit as satellites are inappropriate.  The  idea of  the Commonwealth  of  Nations isinherently different  from tins, and is embodied in the formula &quot; equality of statuswith differentiation of function&quot;.    3.  Despite what has been said  above, the question of the policy to be adopted for the  promotion of inter-Imperial trade must naturally be approached by theMinisters of the United Kingdom largely from the point of view of the trade of theUnited Kingdom, but questions relating to the trade between the different overseasparts of the Empire with one another may and probably will  be raised by them.The  United Kingdom&apos;s trade with the overseas  parts of the  Empire may be promoted            (a) by business men themselves ;  or           (b) by the action of Governments.(a) Steps Involving Action by Business Men.     4.  Two proposals have been put forward, one of  a specific and the other of ageneral  character.   The specific proposal (put forward in the memorandum of theFederation of British  Industries and supported in the Report  of the  economic advisory Council)  is  that  the Empire should aim  at the &quot; rationalisation of empire production, by which each Dominion should manufacture what she canwith  advantage manufacture and facilitate to the utmost  the import from GreatBritain  and other parts of the Empire of those manufactures  which  she is notcapable  of producing economically&quot;  and  that  to achieve this  &quot; individual industries  in  Great Britain and the  Dominions  should  together explore thepossibilities of rationalising their  production&quot; and  &quot; Great  Britain  should beprepared to  assist  with financial  and technical  help &quot; the  establishment  &quot; of
-      135(C1234)B2economically  sound industries  in the  Dominions&quot;.   The  National Union  of manufacturers also has  in  mind  the same general idea.   It is emphasised inthe F.B.I. memorandum that it is  better  for us that industries should develop in the  Dominions  rather  than in  foreign countries.   The F.B.I.  does not say what  part it would  expect Governments  to play, but  evidently the task is mainly for the business interests concerned.  This appears to be recognised by thePreparatory  Committee (of  the  Association  of Chambers of  Commerce, theFederation of British Industries and the Chamber of Shipping) who say            &quot; .  .  .  the Committee realises that  there are certain limitations      to the  action of Governments, and that the practical application of any      policy decided upon is the task of the business communities of the Empire.      The Committee believes  that  the only means of obtaining  a substantial      growth and efficient  rationalisation of Imperial resources, both  from the      point of view of Inter-Imperial trade  and of Imperial world trade,  is for the      representatives of industry, commerce, shipping and finance in the various      parts of the Empire to  be fully consulted  by their Governments upon      questions of policy,  and themselves to get into the closest touch possible      throughout the Empire with a view to discussing,  as a matter of  business,      the most efficient and profitable  organisation of  Empire production and      development as a whole.&quot;    The task  would be a difficult and delicate one and rapid results could not beexpected.   But it should be possible to  arrive step by step as a result  of joint planning, at some kind of co-ordination which would prove beneficial both to our trade  and the overseas parts of the Empire.    5.  Methods of improving our trade would relate not  merely to the increaseof preference, where this was desired, but also to the many other matters which lieoutside the scope of Government action ;  for instance, questions of standardisation,methods of marketing, the establishment  of agencies, depots for spare parts (where these  are necessary), avenues of communication, finance and so forth.  But, as isimplied in the proposals of the Federation of  British Industries, nothing  muchcould be hoped for from a step of  this character unless, at  the same time, UnitedKingdom  industries were  prepared  to support  in the overseas  parts of theEmpire the  estabhshment  or strengthening of industries  which those  parts  ofthe Empire were determined to foster and of which there was promise of success,Support  lent  by United   Kingdom industries  might  take  the   form of theestablishment of  productive branches overseas,  or of  entering  into  workingagreements, and this might  be accompanied by technical and other informationuseful to  those who are only in  the initial stages of the  establishment  of an industry.   The general notion is that of co-operation based on a roughly agreeddivision, which would  be  progressively revisable,  of  the field of  productionbetween manufacturers in  the  United Kingdom  and manufacturers overseas,  tothe mutual advantage of both.   But, rapid progress could not be made alongthese lines,  and an attempt to push  any such movement, if it were started, toofast,  or  otherwise  than in  accordance  with  the natural  process  of  economic development, would probably lead to its breakdown.    6. The idea  of closer co-operation between the various parts of the Empirefor the promotion of trade and industrial development is not now put forward forthe first time.  The last Prime Minister of Australia publicly expressed  the hopethat at  the forthcoming Imperial Conference an effort would be made to grapplewith  the trade relations of the Empire, upon the basis that  the Dominion should give  to United  Kingdom  goods  an easier  entry in cases in which Dominionmanufacturers are not well-equipped  to furnish the necessary supplies themselvesto any large extent, and it  is understood that as a  counterpart to this he wouldhave  expected the collaboration of United Kingdom industries,  bringing capital and technical knowledge, in the development upon  a sound basis in Australia ofthose industries for the establishment of which  Australia is ripe at the presenttime.  It is inevitable, if a  policy on these lines is to materialise, that discussions should  take  place between  the  United Kingdom  and overseas business interestshere  and  overseas, or a series of discussions between limited groups as and whenthe suitable time arrives.   It has been  suggested that the ground might first be broken by arranging  for business missions from the United Kingdom to visit theDominions or such of them as welcomed the idea of closer economic co-operation.
    7. Probably nothing more could be attempted  at the forthcoming ImperialConference than  the general  ventilation of the idea.   The memoranda of theAssociation of Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of British Industries andthe National Union of Manufacturers have been issued, as has also the Report  ofthe Economic Committee of the Trades Union Congress which advocates &quot; as fulla development as possible, of the economic relations between the constituent partsof the Empire.&quot;   The attention  of the overseas Ministers could be called to thesuggestion and an opportunity given for a general expression of opinion.    8. The other proposal which links on to this is that there should be an EmpireCongress or Assembly of Business Men to discuss questions of inter-Imperial trade.This is suggested by the Federation of British  Industries, and something of thesame kind is probably envisaged in one of the recommendations of the Associationof Chambers of Commerce.  The latter body recommends the setting up  of  an empire Trade Assembly analogous to the  Assembly of  the League of Nations one section of which might be devoted to considering &quot; the economic effect of thetrade policy  of each part of  the  Empire,&quot; and this section &quot; should bring into consultation representatives of particular industrial, commercial, financial, shipping,agricultural and other interests within each part of the Empire.&quot;   The NationalUnion of Manufacturers also  pleads  for  systematic  consultation  between representatives  Of industry and trade in the various parts of the Empire,  both inconnection with the Imperial Conference and in the intervals between its meetings.One of the resolutions passed by the recent Congress of the Federation of chambers of Commerce of the British Empire also has the same idea in view.  It is intended that the Congress should not be an isolated event but should be repeated so thatone always took place shortly before each Imperial Conference.  Any resolutionsaimed at calling for Government  action could then be considered without undue delay by  the succeeding Imperial Conference.   At such an assembly of businessmen the proposal dealt with  in the immediately preceding paragraphs, namely,that particular interests in the United Kingdom and the Dominions should explore the possibilities of rationalising industrial development Imperially, would naturally be discussed, and examined in detail if the idea were well received.  There is muchto be said for leaving the organisation of any such Congress  of business men  to business men themselves.  The other idea brought out in the  recommendationof the Association of Chambers  of Commerce  that  there should be an annualImperial Assembly of Ministers will be considered later.(b) Promotion of Inter-Imperial Trade by Government Action.    9. With  regard to  the promotion of  inter-Imperial trade  by government action, we may consider first what has been done by the overseas parts of theEmpire and what, in addition, could be done, and afterwards what has been doneby the United Kingdom and what, in addition, could be  done.     10. (i) Action by Overseas Governments. Generally speaking, the Dominionstreat imports from the United  Kingdom  preferentially, that is to  say,  chargethem lower duties than those imposed on imports  from foreign countries.   Insome cases the preferences are substantial  and in other cases more limited, while in the case of India preferential treatment has only recently been  granted and is confined to  cotton goods and certain descriptions  of iron and steel.  RecentlyCanada, which initiated the system of preferences in  1897, has  largely increased the  preferential treatment  of British  goods.   (A memorandum on preferencesaccorded overseas is being prepared, together with an appreciation of the probable effects of the increased preferences in Canada.)  These preferences as a  whole are extremely beneficial to United Kingdom trade.  It has always been understoodthat the preferences are a free gift, and that each part of the British Empire is entirely at liberty to give them or not, as it pleases.   There is no right to demandthem, and no ground of complaint if they are withheld.  Consequently, it  wouldbe difficult for the United Kingdom Government to suggest any extension  of thesystem of preferences in the overseas  parts of the Empire.  But it goes  without saying that the more cordial the relations between the various parts of the Empire,the closer their contact, and the greater the co-operation between them, the more likely it is that the policy of giving  preferences will be pushed to the  greatest possible extent.   (See further remarks on preference in the Report of the economic advisory Council.)
    11. Important as these preferential rates  are, it must not be supposed thatthey are the scle means of fostering inter-Imperial trade.   The experience of theEmpire Marketing Board  in this country has  suggested, though there are views to the contrary, that a great deal can be done to increase the purchases by anyone part of the Empire of the products of other parts of the Empire by appropriatepublicity,  by facilitating in a  number of minor ways the marketing of Imperialproduce, and in general  by exploiting Imperial  sentiment  and furnishing  themeans by which expression can be given to it in the purchase of goods.  (Foran account of the work of the Empire Marketing Board see paragraph 15.)  Thequestion may be raised whether, as  the  natural  complement of  the  MarketingBoard in this country,  and as part of the machinery for carrying out a policy of encouraging inter-Imperial trade, somewhat similar  bodies  might  not usefully be set up in the various  Dominions to undertake publicity in those dominions in relation to Empire trade, local products being placed first, and generally toconsider the promotion of such trade and the removal of avoidable impediments.Suggestions to this end have been made in various quarters in the United Kingdom.Any such Dominion Marketing Board would, of course, require to be establishedby and on the initiative of the Government of the Dominion in which it  was to operate and to be financed by that Government, although it might, like the board in this country, include  representatives  of the other  parts of  the Empire,  ifavailable.    12. There is no doubt that much could be done in the overseas markets of theBritish Empire  if the overseas Governments established in their countries bodiessimilar to the Empire  Marketing  Board in the United Kingdom, and the more so if a liaison were established between the Empire Marketing Boards so set up with a  view to  co-operation, and exchange of ideas.  It would not be easy forthe Ministers of His  Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United Kingdom baldly to propose the setting up of Empire Marketing Boards in the Dominions or India,but seeing that  a report on the work ot the Empire Marketing Board in the UnitedKingdom  will be before the Conference an opportunity should arise of directingthe discussion in such a way as to give rise to the idea of creating similar boards in the Dominions.   An opportunity might also arise under the item proposed bythe  Canadian  Government  &quot;Development, of  inter-Imperial trade by trade commissioner services, exhibition and general publicity.&quot;   Anyway,  somethingwould be  gained if only overseas Ministers went away from the Conference withthe notion that something more could be done in the way of promoting inter-Imperial trade  by setting up  such Boards.   The Association of Chambers  ofCommerce are anxious that something should be done &quot; with a view to advertisingUnited Kingdom goods  in the  Dominions &quot; and to that end they recommend&quot; that the work of  the Empire Marketing Board should be reconstituted  and extended  so  that it would undertake the work of popularising the  goods  and products of each part of the Empire in all other parts,&quot; the cost of the work beingcovered by contributions from each part of the Empire.   It is not likely, however,that a proposal to get United Kingdom goods advertised in the Dominions through an extension ot  the function ot the Empire Marketing Board would be acceptable to the Dominions as a whole or  even practicable ;  but they  might be disposed to set up Marketing Boards of  their own,&apos; by which means the object  of  therecommendation of the Association of Chambers of Commerce would be achieved.     13. (ii) Action  by His Majesty&apos;s  Government  in  the  United Kingdom. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have naturally not been ableto cover  so  extensive  a  field by the method of preferences as  the DominionGovernments, for the reason that there is no general tariff in the United Kingdom.But ver3&apos;  substantial preferences are given in cases in which our imports are subjectto duties, and  the sum total of the benefit to the overseas parts of the  Empiretaken as a whole for instance,  in respect of the duty on sugar and tobacco, andeven  wine (though this is a  smaller matter) is considerable.  (A note by theBoard of  Customs and Excise on the preferences given by the United Kingdom is printed as an Appendix to the Report of the Economic Advisory Council.)     14. It is sometimes thought  that on account of this our relations with the overseas parts  of the Empire are one-sided, they giving to us more than we give to them.   Any such suggestion, however, overlooks the fact that the  Dominionsare helped in other ways.   The burden of defence by the Navy falls almost entirely on the United  Kingdom.   It is  true that this is not an economic factor, but it is(C1234)B3
evidently a consideration that should not be overlooked.  Again, in the economicfield the Dominions  are  assisted by the finance they  derive  from  the  UnitedKingdom, and in particular by the fact that large parts  of their public borrowingsare  scheduled as  Trustee  Stocks.   Loans  of  more  than   1,100,000,000  areoutstanding in the Dominions  and India, to which this privilege applies, and if thebenefit consists in a saving of, say from J to \ per cent, on the charge of the loan it means an annual sum of from  3 to 5 millions.  This consideration, of course, mustnot be over-pressed.  The benefit to  the Dominions in this case implies no sacrificeon the part of the United Kingdom, beyond the fact that public borrowing here  may-be  rendered a little more expensive.  Nevertheless, the fact remains that the connection  of  the  overseas  parts of the  Empire with the United  Kingdom  doesmean to them an advantage of this  kind.     15. It was because the field for preferences on import duties is so  strictly limited in the United Kingdom, that the Empire Marketing Board was established in  1926 to  promote the marketing in this country of Empire  products.  It isfinanced by His Majesty&apos;s  Government  in the  United Kingdom, but  include?representatives of other parts  of the  Empire.  It is not confined to doing only the obvious things in the way of advertising  the produce of the overseas parts of theEmpire, but includes also the encouragement and financing of scientific researchbearing on  its problems,  and continuous study  of  the methods by  which  saleswithin the United Kingdom of Imperial produce can be promoted.*  It has givengeneral satisfaction  to  the other  parts of the Empire.  Commenting on the workof the  Empire Marketing Board the  Federation of British  Industries says  that&quot; the possibility  of obtaining cheaper freight facilities and lower overhead  chargesby concentrating purchases would be worthy of exploration,&quot; and therefore suggestthat &quot; an investigation  should be made into the possibility of the better organisationof purchasing  and distribution  of Empire products.&quot;   The  idea  may be taken up by  certain Dominions at  the Conference.  Any such examination would,  ofcourse,  require time, but it might result in a step in advance.  (Some observationsbearing on this point will be found in paragraph 16 of the notes on bulk purchase.)t     16. The chief imports from the  overseas parts of the Empire consist of stapleand other food  products  and raw  materials, and the  question whether  further assistance could be given to the Dominions in the marketing of this produce inthe  United  Kingdom  has  been the  subject  of careful  deliberation.  further assistance, if it were feasible,  would no doubt help the Dominions, but it shouldnot be  overlooked that, even  as it is, the United Kingdom is the best market forDominion produce  of this kind,  as the  following table shows : ANNUAL AVERAGE, 1926-28.Commodity.	Exported from the overseas parts of the Empire.		Imported into the United Kingdom and retained.		Total.	To United Kingdom.	From Empire Countries.	From Foreign Countries.Wheat and wheat flour Meat fresh, chilled and frozen . .

The exports are valued f.o.b., and the imports c.i.f.   * Its expenditure has been as follows :         1926-27 ..    ..   135,000        1929-30 ..    ..    650,000 (approximate).        1927-28 ..    ..   404,000        1930-31 ..    ..    S00,000 (estimated).        1928-29 ..    ..   561,000   f According to the Trade Returns of British countries overseas the value  of wheat and flourregistered as consigned to the United Kingdom was  66 millions. This figure is  an over-statement ofamount received in the United Kingdom owing to diversions of ships en route, and to exporters inCanada registering wheat  as consigned to  the  United Kingdom when the final destination wasunknown.  On the other hand the figure given in the table may possibly understate the amount of empire wheat retained in the United Kingdom owing to some grain of Canadian growth being recorded as consigned from the United States, but at  the same time some United States  wheat shipped fromCanadian ports may be recorded as consigned from Canada.f See Paper No. E.E. (B) (30) 18.
However, on the face of it, the table also seems to indicate that there is still scope for the enlargement of our imports of these commodities from the overseas partsof the Empire.  Coming to the question of what might be done, certain dominions would like,  though no doubt they do not expect, to see the imposition of new duties in the United Kingdom with a view to the application of preference over a wider field.  On this no comments need be offered  as Ministers are  fully aware of the issues involved.  The scheme of the Empire Marketing Board is being tried,but its effect on such  staple  articles as cereals and  wool cannot be appreciable.Another idea that has been advanced is  that of a  system of bulk purchase  bythe State, or under the control of the State,  with a view to giving  preferential treatment to Dominion produce in  its operation.   Some  notes on this subjectwill be put forward in separate memoranda. *   Australia has already provisionallyproposed the subject of &quot;  bulk purchase &quot; as an item for the Agenda.    17.  Another  step with  a view to promoting the sale of  overseas  Empireproduce in this country was  taken by the institution of the Imperial EconomicCommittee to report on and make recommendations concerning the marketing ofsuch produce in the United Kingdom.  This Committee is composed of persons nominated by the various Governments represented in the Imperial Conference and responsible to  those Governments, and was appointed as the result of  a discussion at the Imperial Conference of  1923.  Its reference  was limited to  considering&quot; the possibility of improving the methods of preparing for market and marketingwithin the United Kingdom the food products of the  overseas parts of  the Empire,with a view to increasing the consumption of such products in the United kingdom in preference to imports from foreign countries, and to promote the interests bothof producers and consumers.&quot;   It will be seen  that the terms of reference were sodrafted as to  exclude the consideration  of any tariff question.  The  ImperialConference of 1926 extended its reference so as to allow of the inclusion of rawmaterials and entrusted it  also with the preparation of brief preliminary surveys ofthe economic  (including statistical) facts  in relation to such branches of empire trade and marketing  as  might  be  agreed upon.   The Committee will shortlycomplete that portion of  its  work which relates to foodstuffs -the larger part oftheir present terms of reference.    18.  In this connection it may be  recalled  that the  Imperial  shipping committee, which was established as a result of the Imperial Conference of 1918with a constitution similar to that of the Economic Committee, has much widerterms  of reference and is empowered to consider any matters  concerning inter-Imperial shipping and  the material facilities for maritime transport between partsof the Empire that are referred to it by the Governments of the parts of the Empireconcerned.  The Imperial Shipping Committee has been at work for the last nine years and  has given  satisfaction to the various  Governments of the Empire, anumber of whom, including  Canada, have referred  matters to  its consideration.The original proposal  with regard to the Economic Committee  put  forward byMr. Bruce in 1923 was that the Imperial Economic Committee should  be the com-complement of  the Imperial  Shipping Committee  and  that &quot;the  function of  theCommittee should be  to  consider and advise upon any matters of an  economic or commercial character, not  being matters appropriate to be dealt with by the imperial shipping Committee, which are referred to it by any of the constituent Governments,provided that no question which has any  reference to another part of the Empiremay be referred to the Committee without the consent of that other part of  theEmpire.&quot;   The Canadian Government, however, would at that time only  agreeto the appointment of an ad hoc Committee, with the limited terms  of  referencementioned in  the previous paragraph, and they adopted a like attitude in 1926.    It is possible, though it must not be assumed as a matter of course,  that as apart of the movement towards the development of inter-Imperial trade the canadian government might now be prepared to consider an enlargement  of the EconomicCommittee &apos;s terms of reference, reverting perhaps  to something on the lines ofthe original proposal put  forward by Mr.  Bruce.  An Imperial Committee of thiskind, including as it does permanent representatives of this country and the variousDominions  and ad hoc members added for special  purposes from time to time,might prove to be of considerable value not only in reporting on specific questions referred to it  by one  Government or another, but also  in engaging in systematicand continuous economic research into the factors which influence trade within the                   * See Papers Nos, E.E.; (B) (30) 18 and 26.(C1234)                                                                 B4
Empire.  The question is almost certain to come up at the Conference in connectionwith the report on the work done by the Economic Committee. . Should the termsof reference of the Imperial  Economic  Committee  be extended in this manner,it would appear to be  a  body to which  several questions left unsettled  at theImperial Conference might suitably be remitted for subsequent consideration.                                   Part II.    THE DEVELOPMENT OF  IMPERIAL ECONOMIC MACHINERY.    19.  It may be doubted whether all that should be done in the way of pro-promoting inter-Imperial trade can be done if the matter is considered only at triennialconferences.  The  solution of the problem must obviously be progressive.  Itcalls for continuous study; and if, and when, any particular action which requires the decision of more than one  Government seems worth trying there  is now no opportunity for discussion till the next Imperial Conference.  Communicationby despatch or telegram is not a satisfactory substitute.  It would appear, there-fore, that progress in this matter is linked up with  the  question of establishingmore effective Imperial machinery than exists at the present time.   consequently it is proposed to consider now what might be done in the way of  improving theorganisation that exist in connection with the several Empire Governments for economic purposes.    20.  The first thought that strikes anybody who considers what may be called the Imperial machinery existing within the  Empire is its inferiority to the inter-national machinery which exists in the  League of Nations.  The reports of theCommittees of the Association  of  Chambers of Commerce and of the Federationof British Industries, with reference  to  the preparatory work for the ImperialConference, both draw attention to this.   The League of Nations has an Assemblyof Ministers of all  countries members of  the League every year, a Council whichmeets four times a year, and Technical Committees, to advise the Council  on matters within their competence, such as the Economic Committee, the Financial Committee,the Fiscal Committee, and the Advisory and Technical Committee for Communica-tions and Transit, each of which meets about two or three times a year, and hasa  permanent  Secretariat.  Nothing   so  complete is  to be  found within  theCommonwealth of  Nations.  We have only triennial Imperial Conferences and inthe economic sphere four  or five bodies with specific duties, such as the ImperialEconomic Committee (with very limited terms of reference), the Imperial shipping committee,  the Imperial  Communications  Advisory  Committee,  the  empire marketing Board,  the Executive  Council of the Agricultural Research Bureauxand the Imperial Institute.    21.  The  difficulties  in the way of improvement,  arising, for  instance, fromgeographical circumstances and from the point of view of certain of the overseas governments, have hitherto prevented anything  appreciable from being done to remedy this defect.  One example has  already  been furnished in these  notes.When the idea of the Economic Committee was first put  forward in 1923 the con-ception of  its functions  was considerably larger than they ultimately became.Its duties had to be cut down owing to the apprehensions of certain overseas mem-bers of the 1923 Conference, and the  same obstacle was met with again in 1926.However,  in view  of the fact that there has been development of the means ofco-operating in the last six  years, and in view of the favourable  atmosphere atpresent, concentration on the problem at the forthcoming  Conference may  be generally agreed to.   It is to be hoped that a step in advance will be  taken.  Itmay be doubted whether the attainment of the ideal at the  Conference of 1930will be found possible, but it may be found possible to go a long way in the right direction.    22. The root defect  is that the  meeting of overseas Ministers is  held onlyevery three  years.   Now, overseas Ministers concerned with  or having  knowledgeof economic matters come to Europe every year to attend  the Assembly of theLeague of Nations  in September, and there would seem to be  no insuperableobstacle to  a  meeting of these  Ministers in London  either  before or after theAssembly of the League.  The  purpose of the meeting would be to consider theposition at the time of inter-Imperial trade co-operation and to see to the carrying
on of Empire work so far as Ministerial decision was called for, and generally tokeep  things moving and stimulate economic  activities in between the  triennialImperial Conferences.  Any  matters  requiring sanction or direction  arising outof the work of the Imperial organs mentioned above, that is to say, the EconomicCommittee, the Imperial Shipping Committee, the Imperial Communications AdvisoryCommittee, the  Empire Marketing Board,  the  Agricultural Research  Bureaux,etc., and any matters which could be dealt with more easily in this way than by telegram or despatch and could  not  be held up for the next Imperial Conferencewithout sacrificing Imperial interest, would be brought before the meeting.  probably the week before  the meeting of the  Assembly at Geneva would be a more suitable time  than  the week after, as the overseas Ministers frequently go straight from geneva back to  their countries, and may even  be called back before the Assemblycloses.  They are much freer before the Assembly than after,  and are  as a rule in England at that time.  A week  would be a short time for their deliberations,but perhaps in  the first instance it would not be advisable to suggest meetingslasting more than a week, and a week should be  sufficient to  begin with.  It istherefore suggested for consideration  that the idea should be thrown out at theImperial Conference that such overseas Ministers as come to attend the Assemblyof the League and are competent  to deal with economic matters  should meet in London as a sub-Imperial Conference for  a week before the meeting of theAssembly.   It seems unlikely that  a  proposal of this kind would be rejected, as no additional journeying  is involved.  The High Commissioners or  appropriatefunctionaries in  their offices could take the place of Ministers in any case  in which ministers  with  the requisite  knowledge  or  authority were not attending theAssembly of the League.    23. The suggestion relating to improved inter-Imperial machinery containedin a memorandum sent to the Prime Minister (printed as an Appendix  to theReport of the Economic Advisory Council) goes, however, beyond such an annualmeeting of Ministers.   It is there said            &quot; Would it be too ambitious to set before the Conference as an ultimate      idea the organisation of a body representative  of all members of the Empire      to deliberate and advise on all economic questions which do not raise major      political issues, to which would be  affiliated  existing bodies such as the      Imperial  Shipping  Committee, the  Imperial Economic Committee, the      Executive Council for  the  Agricultural Bureaux, and any new  bodies      hereafter  brought into being  to forward  economic co-operation  ?           &quot; In the creation of such a body the experience and methods of Geneva      would be of great value.   It  should be appointed and in some  degree      financially supported by all the Empire Governments.  It would imply      a permanent staff controlled by a Conference or Council meeting at not      too infrequent intervals. Such meetings should nowadays not be impossible      to  arrange.  Each autumn  Ministers  and other  high  representatives of      the Dominion Governments meet in the Assembly of the League of Nations      at Geneva.  Most, if not all,  of them visit London on their way to or from      Geneva.   It should not be difficult to arrange for them to meet in Council      in London either immediately before or after  the Assembly of the League.      In  practice,  Dominion Governments, provided their equal authority be      recognised, do not object to London as the venue of inter-Imperial meetings.      But it should also be feasible for occasional meetings to be held in Canada      or Australia.  The permanent staff should include officers from the  overseas      Dominions, and its officers should travel  about the Empire in pursuit of      its investigations.  The possible scope and precise functions of the proposed      body would  need careful  thought ;  some  tentative suggestions  are put      forward in the  Appendix.&quot;    This is open to the interpretation that a more formally constituted  bodymeeting more frequently than once a year is contemplated, at any rate  as the eventual ideal.  Moreover, an Imperial Secretariat is suggested, and  in  thisconnection it may be noted that  the  Preparatory Committee of  the Associationof Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of British Industries and the Chamberof Shipping of the United Kingdom recommend an  Imperial Secretariat as doesalso  the Economic Committee of the Trades Union Congress (The Federation ofBritish  Industries  further suggests that it might be used also for  the Empirebusiness Congress which they propose).
    24. If a nucleus on these lines for the development of Imperial economic co-operation were created,  the work would naturally  develop of itself.   It doesnot therefore appear necessary to  attempt to define precisely at this stage what should be  undertaken if the  proposed organisation were set up.   A  suggestedoutline of possible work is contained in the appendix to the memorandum sent tothe Prime Minister (see Appendix to Report of Empire Trade Committee of economic advisory  Council).  The   new  organisation  would,  it  is  suggested,  assume responsibility  for the  Imperial Economic Committee, the  Imperial shipping committee, the Executive  Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux, and  theTransport  Council, and it  would naturally, if not  controlling, at once establishclose  contact  with,  the Imperial  Institute.  Thus it would be a co-ordinatingbody.  But at the same time, it would, according to the scheme, initiate work infresh  directions and in general deliberate  and advise  on economic  co-operation.And,  if it is set up, no doubt during the  forthcoming Conference matters wouldbe left over for its consideration ;  for instance, the  proposal by the Federation ofBritish Industries that an Imperial trade  information bureau should be  set upmight very well  be  referred to  it.  In order that  the new body should  not becramped in initiating new  work, it is suggested in  the memorandum referred tothat it would be desirable to endow  it with  some  funds.   Nothing considerablewould be required at the outset.  The sum of  30,000 per annum to begin withhas been suggested,  and as the body would be an  Imperial one, all the overseasparts  of the Empire would contribute to this, so that the burden on the  UnitedKingdom would not be heavy.    25. Certain doubts are felt,  however, with regard  to the line of  developmentof the machinery for Imperial co-operation outlined above.  There  are thosewho fear that it runs counter to present tendencies in the evolution of the Empireand that it would meet with strong opposition from certain Dominions on grounds of principle.  It  is  agreed that the annual meeting  of Ministers of the Empireis highly  desirable, and it is  admitted that this Ministerial  meeting would  not seem  to provide in itself adequate  machinery to deal comprehensively with manyof the problems of economic trade policy  that might  be likely to arise.   But itis felt that any proposal to set up a standing body of representatives of the overseas and home Governments to meet  frequently  and  an  Imperial secretariat would arouse serious apprehensions on the part of certain of the Dominions.   It is thoughtthat,  in so far as such a body was proposed  for the purpose of dealing with mattersnot already covered by the sphere of action of existing inter-Imperial  bodies,much the same objection would be felt by certain Dominions in regard to it as has already proved to be the case when an extended scope for the Imperial EconomicCommittee has been suggested ; that is to say, it would be likely to be objected to as a body  designed by the United Kingdom Government for the purpose of considering and deciding questions in London which the Dominion Governmentsregarded as more properly being within the sphere of the Governments at home to settle.   Such objection  might perhaps  be modified if it  were  made clear thatthe new  organisation would not necessarily be permanently  centred in London.It might be said  further that it  would be liable to take up matters already dealtwith  by inter-Imperial bodies,  such as the  Imperial Economic Committee, orinterfere with their work,  which would be resented by those bodies as implying that they were incapable of discharging satisfactorily the duties which had alreadybeen  assigned to  them.  The  danger of overlapping could  no doubt be guarded against if the  proposal   otherwise  commended  itself.   Objections  would  beminimised, it is thought, if the new organisation were  started on a modest scale ;the object aimed  at could,  it is suggested, be largely secured by the establishmentof a small secretariat  and  of a committee, representative on an agreed scale ofthe Governments of the Empire, to supervise the secretariat between the  annualmeetings of Ministers, and carry out the instructions given by the annual meetingsof Ministers,  in so far as the work did not naturally  fall to other organisations.On the other hand it is pointed out  that the existing Imperial Economic Committee,with  extended terms  of reference, might  deal with  any such work ;  and  thedifficulties hitherto encountered in the way of enlarging the scope of the existingCommittee&apos;s activities will not necessarily  be  overcome by  the erection of a new body.  The Economic Committee already includes representatives of the Dominionsand reports to the Empire Governments, and it may  be  that the difficulties referredto above might be lessened  if the Dominions paid part of the Committee&apos;s expenses
&amp;      139and had a larger share of the membership.  While the present inferiority of thecentralised Economic  Committee  of  the British  Commonwealth of Nations ascompared with the machinery of the League of Nations is admitted the applicationof a parallel system to  the  problem of the former  would not, it  is suggested,necessarily prove to be an appropriate solution.  The organisation of the Leagueof Nations, with its Council meeting every few months, its technical bodies advisoryto the Council, and its Secretariat, must, from the nature of the case, be centralised,but it does not follow that a similar solution is appropriate to the British Common-wealth of Nations.  The constituent parts are fewer and are more closely related,so that direct contact  between the Governments with a view to a  common  end should be easier.  Moreover, the matters that arise  are  often of great delicacy,affecting as they do the different economic  interests  and policy of the separate and autonomous  communities that go to make up the British Empire, includingquestions closely  affecting their  Parliaments.    26. Bearing these  considerations  in  mind and if  the scheme just dealt withis not  generaUy acceptable,  there appear  to be possibilities in another  scheme,put forward as an  alternative, which goes beyond the possible extension of  thefunctions of the existing Imperial Economic Committee in this country  and  the suggested annual meetings of Ministers from the Dominions.   Briefly the idea is that such of the Dominions as are prepared to take a further step should themselvesset  up  Imperial  Economic  Committees in  their  own  countries,  consisting ofrepresentatives of such parts of the Empire  as are. willing to appoint them, andwith advisory  and investigatory  functions  similar to those suggested  for  theImperial Economic  Committee in London.  It is possible that such an organisationof Imperial Economic Committees would  commend itself to some of the dominions on political and constitutional grounds as a  complement to the suggested extensionof the functions of the Imperial Economic Committee in London.  An organisation on  these lines would  correspond to the  political  organisation  of the BritishCommonwealth of  Nations ;  it  would be  flexible ;  it would  always be on  the spot where any  particular problem  required  investigation,  and would  providemachinery enabling the leaders of industry in any part of the Empire  as well as its Ministers to be consulted on any development of policy ; and it would providefor differing political and economic circumstances, since the fact that one Dominionwas not  ready  to adopt  such machinery would not necessarily prevent its being adopted  in another Dominion.  Moreover,  it might tend to meet any  objectionsof the Dominions  to an  extension of the functions of the existing Imperial EconomicCommittee, based on the fear that Empire policy would  tend to be dictated from london  instead  of each Dominion maintaining its hard-won independence inthe sphere of economic policy.  A further  advantage  would be that such an organisation would be in harmony with the establishment in some of the dominions of Empire Marketing Boards if this were agreed to.  The functions of the ImperialEconomic Committee  and  of the  Empire  Marketing  Board  in this countiy  arecomplementary in the sense that the former examines and advises from an Imperialpoint of view while the latter  is an executive organ of the United  KingdomGovernment charged by  that Government with the task of carrying out certaindefinite functions.  Thus the establishment of  Imperial Economic. Committees incertain of the Dominions might well pave the way for the establishment  of empire marketing Boards in those Dominions, the desirability of which has been  referredto earlier in this memorandum (paras. 11 and 12).    27.  It must be recognised, however, that there are certain practical difficul-ties.  Firstly in the matter of personnel it is not generally the present  practiceof the Dominions to maintain representatives in the other Dominions qualified torepresent them on  such a committee ; again, the representation of the  colonies on such, committees would cause similar  practical difficulties.   Secondly, such committees might be appointed in some parts of  the Empire but not  in others ;and consequently they would not necessarily form an effective organ for investi-gating problems  affecting the Empire as a  whole.   A further difficulty is thatthere might be a lack  of co-ordination and  even  differences of opinion betweenthe various Economic  Committees ;   but this difficulty is inherent  in  the wholepolitical structure of the British Commonwealth of Nations and has hitherto  notbeen found insuperable in the political sphere.
    28.  It is impossible to say with any degree of assurance what the attitudeof the  Dominions will be.  It is therefore suggested that the  wisest course is forthe representatives of the United Kingdom to keep an open mind.  The important thing is that some step forward should be taken in the  development of inter-Imperial machinery for  economic purposes.  Whether at this stage it should  takea centralised or decentralised form is not, it would seem, a consideration of momentfrom the point of view of  the United Kingdom.                                 SUMMARY.                                  Part  I.                       IMPERIAL  TRADE  POLICY.    The development of inter-Imperial trade can be promoted            (i) by action on the part of business men in the different parts of the      Empire ; or           (ii) by the action of Governments.(i) Steps involving Action by Business Men.    It has been proposed that the rationalisation of Empire production  shouldbe aimed at.   By this is meant that each Dominion should manufacture what she can with advantage manufacture  economically, and facilitate to the utmost theimportation from Great Britain and the other parts of the Empire of those manu-factures which she is  not capable of producing  economically.  All methods of improving  trade, including for instance questions  of standardisation, would come up for examination.    To  achieve this end, individual industries in Great  Britain and the dominions would have to explore the possibilities together, industries in the United Kingdombeing prepared to  assist with  financial and technical help the establishment ofeconomically sound industries in  the Dominions.    This idea, more or less precisely enunciated, is  embodied  in the Reportspresented to  the Government by the Preparatory Committee (of  the Associationof Chambers  of  Commerce, the Federation  ot British Industries, and the Chamberof Shipping) ; and  Mr. Bruce, the  last  Minister for Australia,  publicly  gaveexpression  to the same line of thought.    The working out of any such policy in detail would have to be left to thebusiness interests concerned.   As a first step, arrangements might be made for business Missions from the United Kingdom to visit the Dominions (paras. 4-7).    Another  suggestion put  forward  as  a  result of the work of  the  preparatory committee referred to  above is that in some way representatives of industry and commerce, including labour, in different parts of the Empire, should be drawn into consultation when  Imperial policy in its economic aspect is being considered,and in this connection  the specific proposal is made that periodically an EmpireAssembly or Congress of Business Men should be held to discuss questions of inter-Imperial trade.   The idea is  that a congress of business men should be assembledshortly  before each  Imperial Conference, so that any resolutions calling for govern-ment action could be considered by the Imperial Conference without undue delay.There is much to be said for leaving the actual organisation of congresses of businessmen  to business men  themselves (para. 8).(ii)  The Promotion of Inter-Imperial Trade  by Government Action.    Consideration is given under this heading to (1) action by Overseas governments and (2)  to  action by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.    (1)  Action by Overseas  Governments. Attention is called to  the  preferencesoverseas accorded to imports from  the  United Kingdom which, taken  as a whole,have  been extremely beneficial to United  Kingdom trade.   (A separate  memor-andum  on these preferences is in course of  preparation.)  Recently Canada, which
 initiated the system of preferences in 1897, has increased the preferential treatment of British goods.  It  has always been understood that  preferences are a free gift, no  part of the Empire having a right to demand them of another part, but the more co-operation is agreed upon between the several parts of the Empire, the more likely is it that the preference policy overseas will be pushed to the greatest possible extent (para. 10).     Preferences are not the sole means of fostering inter-Imperial trade.  In various quarters in the United  Kingdom it has been suggested that  Empire  Marketing Boards might be established in the  Dominions.   If such bodies were established in the Dominions, the importation of Empire goods would no doubt be stimulated by appropriate publicity and by facilitating in a number of minor ways the market - ing of goods originating within  other parts of the Empire.  It would be difficult for the Ministers of His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the  United Kingdom to bring forward  this  proposal,  but  no doubt   an opportunity will occur  for directing discussion in such a way as to give rise  to this idea (paras. 11 and 12).     (2) Action by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. It has not been possible to cover so extensive a field  by the method of preferences here as in the Dominions, owing to the limited number of import duties in the United Kingdom, but very substantial preferences are given  in cases  in which imports are subject to duties.    In this connection, however, it should not be overlooked that the Dominions are helped in other ways.  The burden of defence by the Navy falls almost entirely on  the United  Kingdom.   Again,  the  Dominions are  assisted in finance by the scheduling of large parts of their public borrowings as Trustee Stocks.  The annualbenefit under this head probably amounts to a sum of from  3,000,000 to  5,000,000 (para.  14).    The  field for preferences  on imports being so strictly limited in the United Kingdom led  to the setting up of  the  Empire  Marketing Board  in  1926.  It is financed  bv H.M. Government in the United Kingdom, and its expenditure was more than&quot; 550,000 in 1928/9,  650,000 in 1929/30, and is estimated at  800,000 for  1930/31.   It aims  at encouraging imports from the Dominions by publicity,the continuous study of the methods by which such sales can be promoted and the financing of scientific research.  It should be borne in mind, however, that  our imports from the Dominions consist largely of staple food products  and rawmaterials, and that the effect of the activities of the Empire Marketing Board, onsuch articles as cereals and wool for instance, cannot be appreciable.   The questionof additional duties, with a view to giving  a  preference to the Dominions, and of bulk purchase, may therefore be brought forward.   Australia has already provision-ally proposed the subject of bulk purchase as an item  for the Agenda  (para.  16).    Another step, with a view to promoting the sale of overseas  Empire foodproducts in this  country, was taken by the institution in 1923 of  the Imperial Economic Committee to report and make recommendations on the marketing ofsuch produce in the United Kingdom.   In 1926 the terms of reference were  ex-tended to allow  of the inclusion of raw  materials and certain surveys of empire trade.  This Committee is composed of persons nominated by the various Govern-ments represented at the Imperial Conference.   Its terms of reference,  even as extended, are very limited.   When the idea of the Economic Committee was firstbrought forward in 1923 by Mr. Bruce, it was suggested that it should have widerterms of reference, and  &quot; consider  and  advise upon any matters  of an economic or commercial character referred to it  by any  of  the constituent Governments,provided that no question that  had any reference to another part of the empire should be referred to the Committee without the consent of that other part of  theEmpire.&quot;   The Canadian Government felt difficulties,  however,  about these wideterms of reference and they were consequently limited.  It is to be hoped thatthe forthcoming Imperial Conference will agree now to extend the existing  termsof reference.   In this way the usefulness  of  the Committee could be  increased, and several questions  left unsettled at the  forthcoming  Conference might suitablybe remitted to it for  subsequent consideration  (paras.  17 and 18).
                                  Part II.       DEVELOPMENT OF  IMPERIAL ECONOMIC MACHINERY.     It is  suggested that a meeting should be held annually in London  of overseasMinisters  who are in Europe each autumn to attend the Assembly  of the League ofNations, with a view to securing a more frequent consideration of the economic problemsof the Empire (para. 22).     Further, it has been suggested that a new Imperial Committee, representativeof  all the  Governments taking part  in the  Imperial Conference,  should beset  up  to deliberate  and  advise on  all  questions  which do  not raise  major political  issues.  To  this  Committee  existing  bodies such as  the imperial shipping Committee,  the Imperial Economic Committee, the Executive Councilof the Agricultural Research Bureaux, the  Imperial  Communications AdvisoryCommittee, etc., would be affiliated.   Thus  the work of the new body would betwofold, deliberative and supervisory or  co-ordinating.   It is suggested  that itshould be feasible for occasional meetings of the new body to be  held in parts ofthe Empire other than the United Kingdom.   A  permanent secretariat  is  also proposed,  to include officers from the  overseas Dominions.  The preparatory committee (representative of the Association of Chambers of Commerce, the Fed-eration of British Industries and the Chambers of Shipping of the United Kingdom)and the Economic Committee of the Trades Union Congress recommend the settingup of a permanent Imperial Secretariat (paras. 23 and 24).    There are those, however, who fear that the idea of a  developed centralisedImperial machinery runs counter to certain tendencies in  the evolution of theEmpire, and would meet with opposition from certain Dominions.  They point outthat if the terms of reference of the existing Imperial Economic Committee areextended some provision  will be made for the more continuous study of Imperialtrade problems ; and suggest that the next  step in the development of Imperialmachinery might take the form of the establishment of Economic Committees inthe Dominions, the several  Economic Committees maintaining contact with one another.   It is argued that, if the difficulties in the way can be surmounted, an organ-isation on these lines would  correspond to the political organisation  of the  BritishCommonwealth of Nations,  and would furnish machinery on the spot  when anyparticular problem required investigation overseas (paras. 25-27).    It is  impossible to say what the attitude of the Dominions will  be.   It issuggested  that the wisest course is for the representatives of the United kingdom to keep an open mind.   Whether at this stage the development of inter-Imperialmachinery for economic purposes should take a centialised  or de-centralised formis not,  it would seem,  a consideration  of moment  for  the United  Kingdom(para. 28).2, Whitehall  Gardens,  S.W.1.

                                      APPENDIX  A.          NOTE COVERING THE REPORT  OF  THE BRITISH  PREPARATORY                                        COMMITTEE.     1. The British Preparatory Committee consists of representatives of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of British Industries, and the Chamber of Shipping.   Reports were drawn up by the representatives of each of the constituent bodies and the form of the report of the Joint Committee  (Enclosure No. 1) consists of a short memorandum covering the three separate reports of the constituent bodies.     2. The whole of  the joint report, and large parts of the separate reports of the Association of Chambers of Commerce and of the Federation of British Industries, consist of proposals aiming at a more elaborate economic machinery for the Empire as a whole and closer consultation between the various countries with a view to developing a common economic policy.   In addition, the reports of the constituent bodies contain a number of miscellaneous recommendations on points of comparative detail.     3. As regards inter-Imperial machinery in economic matters and an Imperial policy, the Preparatory Committee suggest an Imperial Economic Secretariat drawn  from all parts of the  Empire, which, together with the interests involved, could give  consideration  to the problem of formulating a trade policy for the Empire as a  whole.   Such a policy should be formulated after full examination of the facts in consultation with business interests and uninfluenced by political factors.   Representatives of business interests  throughout  the Empire should get  together  and discuss  the best  practical organisation of Empire development.     4. The Federation of British Industries draw attention to the fact that the  League of Nations is better provided with machinery for discussion than the Empire and they suggest the convening of an Imperial Trade Conference somewhat on the lines of the World Economic Conference to lay down an economic policy for the Empire.  The Trade Conference would meet  periodically and  prior to Imperial Conferences.  It would investigate and advise on all questions affecting inter-Imperial trade and, in particular, ascertain how far  the  Dominions are prepared to grant additional preferential treatment  to  British  goods.   The  Federation also suggest a  permanent Imperial  Secretariat.  As regards policy, the Federation suggest that in view of the inevitable development of industry in the Dominions, it should be the aim of the Dominions on the one  hand to develop only  those industries which are economically sound and to facilitate the entry from the United Kingdom of other products, and of the United Kingdom on the other hand to aid in the development of such industries in order to ensure the  adoption of British methods, etc.  This would require joint exploration by individual industries.    5. The Association of Chambers of Commerce suggest machinery analogous to that of the League of Nations and an Empire Trade Assembly, and they also suggest annual meetings of  Ministers of the various parts of the Empire competent to discuss economic matters.  All three organisations ask that existing preferences granted by Great Britain should not be disturbed.    6. The recommendations  of the  Preparatory  Committee  outlined above may  conveniently be divided into those primarily involving action by the business interests themselves and those requiring Government action.   The convening of Imperial Trade Conferences or Assemblies consisting wholly or mainly of representatives of business interests, is a matter primarily for business men themselves. The rationalisation of industry on an Empire-wide basis would have to be worked out by the individual industries concerned,  although the overseas  Governments,  by suitable tariff adjustments, could do something to help the attainment of the objective when once the industries concerned have come to agreement  amongst themselves.  The necessary consultations in individual industries  could either flow  from the Trade Conferences or they might be initiated by Governments on the advice of the business interests concerned.  It should be borne in mind that rationalisation of industry on a national basis appears  to be a necessary preliminary to rationalisation  on an Empire-wide basis, so that thefield  in which  the latter can usefully be discussed at the present time is limited.    7. The broad questions raised above, including the question of inter-Imperial machinery in theeconomic field, are discussed in the preceding memorandum.    8. Detailed  subjects for discussion suggested by the Association of Chambers of Commerce are as follows :            (a) Commercial  Treaties :  Consultation  between all Imperial Governments on the terms      of any  treaty between a Dominion  and a  foreign country.           This question was fully  considered at the 1926 Conference and the procedure then adopted      provides that any Government negotiating a treaty should take steps to inform  the other      Governments likely  to  be interested of its intentions.  This seems to provide sufficiently for      the point  raised above.           (b) Conditions of marketing and distribution of the Australian wool clip.           It  appears doubtful whether  this subject  can appropriately  be raised at the  Imperial      Conference, as it only concerns a limited number of countries and by no means all the countries      represented at the Conference.  It appears to be the sort of subject which might be considered      by an Imperial Trade Conference.
           (c) Commercial intelligence : The appointment of agents by the Dominions in the United       Kingdom and the extension of Trade Commissioner Services.           ft appears very probable that aspects of this question will be considered by the Imperial       Conference, especially as the Canadian Government have put down &quot; Development of inter-       Imperial trade by Trade Commissioner Services, exhibitions and general publicity &quot;.           (d) Postal rates : Imperial penny postage and lower postal  rates between the United       Kingdom and the Dominions.           It appears that Imperial penny postage cannot precede national  penny postage.  The       latter is a domestic question in which a substantial amount of revenue is involved.  It might       be that alternative forms of revenue necessary to replace the revenue lost by reverting to penny       postage might be more onerous to industry than the 1-Jrf. stamp.  The matter is one primarily       for the General Post Office and the Treasury, and those Departments are also primarily concerned       with the question of parcel rates.           (c) Commercial travellers&apos; licence fees and Customs duties on trade catalogues.           The latter subject has been raised at former Conferences, unfortunately without producing       much effect, and it appears doubtful whether any useful purpose would be served by raising       these subjects now, though the  matter might be borne in mind.  An opportunity might occur,       for instance, in any review of action taken on the resolutions of the 1926 Conference.           (/) The taxation of agents of British firms in the Dominions.           As the  Association of  Chambers  of Commerce point out,  this subject was considered       in 1926.   It seems doubtful whether there would be any hope of  carrying the matter further,       if it  were raised again, though here again an opportunity for discussion might occur.    9. The Chamber of Shipping  suggest the following subjects :            (a) Ratification of International Conventions by the Dominions.           (6) Flag discrimination by  Portugal.           (c) Uniformity in merchant shipping legislation.           (d) Co-operation with shipping in promoting inter-Imperial trade.           (e) Double taxation on shipping.                 (a) Ratification  of International  Conventions  by the Dominions.    The memorandum urges that the  &quot; British  Empire &quot;  should honour  its signature to Conventionswhich it has joined in promoting  ; presumably  the Governments of the United Kingdom and of the self-governing Dominions are referred to.    The statement says that the following Conventions have not yet been ratified in all parts of theEmpire : -         Convention on Immunity  of Public Ships ;         On Limitation of Shipowners&apos;  Liability ;         On Maritime Mortgages and Liens.    The position as regards the Convention on Immunity is that an endeavour is still being made to persuade all foreign Governments which were parties to the Convention to agree.to certain provisos,which will take the form of a Protocol.   The drawing up and signing of the Protocol will probably haveto be  effected by diplomatic representatives of the Governments in Brussels, where ratifications of theConvention are recorded.    As regards the other  two  Conventions Limitation of Liability, and Mortgages and Liens theposition is that they cannot be given effect to in this country without legislation ; the legislation  is in process of drafting by the Parliamentary Counsel, but, owing to the difficulty of the task and pressure of more urgent drafting work, the Bill has not yet been drafted.    As regards the ratification by self-governing Dominions of International Conventions, the questionis, of course, mainly for them.   It does not seem probable that any advantage will be gained by puttingon the Agenda the question of these Conventions, particularly as the Agenda is already heavy.                            (b)  Flag Discrimination by Portugal.    The discrimination practised by  Portugal in favour of  Portuguese &quot;shipping  is  well known.Mr. Cleminson paid a visit to Lisbon  at the beginning of the year, and H.M. Ambassador was askedto help him in his mission, which was directed towards persuading Portuguese authorities to abandondiscrimination.    Representations have  also  been  made through the  diplomatic channel,  andthe Portuguese  Government have replied to  the effect that  they are considering the whole matter very carefully.                     (c)  Uniformity in Merchant Shipping Legislation.    The references in the memorandum on this matter show that the Chamber of Shipping is fully aware of the need for the readjustment of relations between the various parts of the British Commonwealth,on the basis of equality of  status,  and that this involves the amendment of shipping legislation.   Thememorandum appears to have been written before the report of the Sub-Conference of 1929 was printed.A new stage has been reached by the preparation in the Board of Trade of an Agreement of the characterrecommended in the Report, and  it is hoped to arrange for this Agreement to be considered on theeconomic side of the Conference.
(C1234)c                   (d) Co-operation with Shipping in promoting Imperial Trade.    The memorandum refers chiefly to the need for close co-operation between shipowners, producers and merchants, to render services more efficient.  The question is very wide, and it will be rememberedthat the Canadian Government have suggested, as an item in the  Agenda, under  the  heading of&quot; Transport,&quot; the question of the adequacy of shipping services.                                 (e)  Double Taxation on Shipping.    This is  a highly technical  matter on which the Inland Revenue will supply a  short note.(Enclosure No. 2.)    10. The Federation of British Industries suggest :           (a) That a system should be devised whereby knowledge as to Empire sources of supply      should be available to all dealers and retailers in the United Kingdom.          Work on these lines  is already done  by the  Empire Marketing Board, and the  above      suggestion might be referred to that body rather than to the Imperial Conference.          (b) That an  Empire  College should be established in  London  for students from  the      Dominions and Colonies, with the object of the students securing general knowledge  about      conditions in this country.          This hardly appears a matter for initiation by Governments, and would require examination      from the  educational point of view before any proposals were  put forward.          (c) That steps should be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government to provide financial facilities      for the furtherance of air transport within the Empire.          The whole question of the promotion of Civil Aviation is already down for discussion.

145                          THEIMPERIAL   ECONOMIC   CONFERENCE.                 REPORT  OF  THE BRITISH  PREPARATORY  COMMITTEE.     The Reports of the three constituent bodies forming the British  Preparatory  Committee, namely, the Association of British  Chambers  of Commerce,  the  Federation  of  British Industries  and the  Chamber of  Shipping  of  the  United Kingdom, representing the organised commerce, industry and shipping of  Great Britain and Northern Ireland, indicate the high importance of British Empire  trade to the prosperity and well-being of this country.   When  it  is realised that the British Empire has  an  area of  14  million  square miles of territory, occupied  by  451  millions of  people,  with vast supplies of  the food  and raw materials required by man and industry, it is clearly essential that,  in order to take  the fullest advantage of these great resources,  some simple, coherent and universally accepted trade policy should be established.    Such a policy must in  the nature of things be designed and developed by people  with expert knowledge of  the trades and problems involved, and must have stability and  continuity in order to  maintain that  confidence and security which is a vital condition to any form of trade.    That the British Empire should operate as an economic unit has long been an ideal towards which many efforts  have been made.   That  these efforts have not so far  been  fully successful is due fundamentally to the lack of proper machinery for the consideration of the many problems that arise, and for enabling proper and suitable  action to be taken following the conclusions arrived at.    The British Preparatory Committee attaches as appendices to this document the three reports drawn up by its constituent bodies upon the question of  the development of the trade ofthe Empire.  Although  in  matters of detail  and  procedurethere are certain differences in the recommendations containedin the reports, there is general agreement upon the underlyingpoints of principle.
    The British Preparatory Committee, having consideredthe reports  in  question, desires to state that the  followingpoints are of paramount importance, and  require  the mostimmediate attention :1.  That the most urgent necessity exists for increasing  to       the utmost the trade of  the Empire.     Not only  does the Empire already  provide a vast outlet for British manufactured goods, representing over 45 per cent.of the  total British  exports, but Imperial natural resources are  so  vast that, fully developed, they give the promise of  anincrease in trade far beyond anything which can be imaginedat the present day.      In considering this problem, however, it is essential that the   question  should not  be  approached  merely  from   the United Kingdom  point  of view, but should be dealt with in the  broadest spirit and with the  realisation that any policy suggested must take  into  full  account the economic  interests of each part of the Empire.   In fact the policy should be an Imperial policy and not a  policy imposed by any one or more parts of the Empire  upon the remainder.  Reciprocal  trade in the  widest  sense is  a necessity  for  the  sound  economic development of each part  of the Empire, and  as such should be  fostered by all practical means.  Moreover, the object in view should  be,  not  only to  increase  the  volume  of trade within the Empire, but by organising the Empire upon sound economic lines to enable it to contribute as a unit,  in  a larger degree than at present, to the total volume of world trade.  The realisation of such a policy would be, not only to raise the  level  of   prosperity  within the  Empire,  but  also, by  increasing  the wealth and purchasing power of the Imperial  unit, to contribute  towards a  general  improvement in world  conditions.  2.   An Empire  Economic Policy.      So many factors enter into the problem  of any change in  the economic  structure of the Empire that the Committee  feels  there is danger of grave  mistakes being committed unless  full investigation takes  place  before  any  line of  policy  is  adopted.   For instance,  the reactions  of  Imperial economic  policy upon different interests, such as industry,  agriculture,  commerce, finance  and shipping, their  effect upon the volume  of  Imperial  trade  with  foreign countries,  and their bearing  upon the  question of  invisible exports,  so  important to our   national welfare, must be fully and scientifically taken into   account if a wise decision is to be arrived at.
    The Committee is convinced that the present methods ofImperial economic consultation are inadequate and render anysuch scientific study of the problem impossible.  It is a  factthat better machinery exists in connection with the  EconomicSection of  ihe League of  Nations  for discussing  economic problems with foreign  countries, than  is the case within theBritish  Empire.  The Committee holds most firmly that thisserious  flaw in the  economic  organisation  of  the Empiremust  and can be  remedied.  If  the Empire  is to arrive ata  common  policy  there  must  be  adequate  machinery for investigation and  consultation, and the  creation  of  such machinery  is the  most immediate  problem confronting theEmpire to-day.    The Committee therefore recommends :    (a) That  suitable machinery for constant and adequateinvestigation and consultation  within  the Empire should be devised.    (b) In particular the  Committee urges most strongly  thatas part of  this machinery a permanent Imperial  economicSecretariat,  drawn  from  all parts of the Empire, should beestablished, in order to pursue a constant study of the problems involved, to serve as a centre of accurate  information uponwhich alone sound decisions can be taken, and  to ensure  thatEmpire policy is not considered spasmodically, but is subjectto continuous and scientific study and action.    (c) The problem of devising an Economic policy for theEmpire should be  studied in a scientific  spirit, free from all political  bias, and, in the work  of the permanent secretariat and of any  Conference which  may  take place in connectionwith that work, every  question affecting Inter-Imperial trade should be brought  under review, and no question should be debarred from discussion owing to political party prejudices oropinions.    (d) The  Committee  recommends  that  in   this  freediscussion and examination of the problems  involved, repre-sentatives of all organised economic interests, including labour,should be intimately associated with the work on the linesadvocated in the attached  reports,  not only in view of theirvital  interest, but because of the practical experience whichthey would bring to the study of such problems.    (e) In conclusion, the Committee realises that  there arecertain  limitations to the action of Governments, and that thepractical application of any policy decided upon is the task ofthe business communities of  the Empire.   The Committeebelieves that the only means of obtaining  a substantial growth and  efficient rationalisation of Imperial resources, both fromthe point of view of Inter-Imperial  trade  and of  Imperial
world trade, is  for the representatives of industry, commerce,shipping and finance in the various parts of the Empire to be fully consulted by their Governments upon questions of policy,and themselves to get into the closest touch possible throughoutthe Empire with a view to discussing, as a matter of business,the most efficient  and profitable organisation  of  Empireproduction and development as a whole.    The Committee regards the above points of principle asso greatly outweighing in importance any other aspects of theproblem, that in the present  report it has been decided to limitits comments to these main questions of principle.  .GILBERT  C.

APPENDIX No.  I.BRITISH  ECONOMIC  POLICY  WITH   REGARD   TO  THE   DOMINIONS.REPORT OF  THE  FEDERATION  OF  BRITISH    INDUSTRIES TO  THE  BRITISH  PREPARA-    TORY   COMMITTEE  FOR  THE  IMPERIAL    CONFERENCE.    THE  Federation presents the following conclusions andrecommendations  with  regard to  the  economic  relationsbetween Great Britain and the Dominions, including India.1.   That  the most  urgent necessity exists  for this      country to  take  all possible  steps  to increase      trade  with   the  Dominions,  for  the  following      reasons:    (a)  Owing to the great absorptive power of the dominions to  consume British  goods, as evidenced by the  large volumeof  existing trade, representing nearly 50 per cent, of  the total british exports of manufactured goods, and by the large per capita purchase of  such products by the populations of  theEmpire.   On  the other hand it is  a regrettable  fact that  theDominions are drawing an  increasing proportion  of their imports from  sources outside the Empire.    (b)  Owing to  the  increasing economic nationalism  offoreign countries which  are more  and more  striving to make themselves self-sufficing, and to  shut  out  goods  by tariff barriers.    It is realised that the same desire for industrial expansionprevails in many of the Dominions, but the  establishment ofnew  industries in  the  overseas  countries  of  the Empire,although  it  has an immediate adverse effect  upon  BritishIndustry,  usually entails in the long run some  compensatingadvantages.   For  instance,  a Dominion industry is more likely than   a foreign  industry  to  purchase  British plant and semi-manufactured goods. Again, if the  prosperity of
a  Dominion is increased by  the  establishment of  a new industry, the resulting prosperity is more likely to lead to anincrease  in  the demand  for British products and man-powerthan in the case of the  development of such an industry ina foreign country.     (c) Owing to the inevitable tendency of foreign countries,as  they  develop  their  industries,  to  become  increasinglyexporting countries,  thus competing directly  with  british exports to other countries.     In this connection   the  most  significant  factor is therapidly expanding export trade of the U.S.A., which althoughthe domestic  market  is  still doubtless  full  of  potentialities,must in time be driven to dispose of an  increasing  proportionof  her production abroad.  At present the  United  Statesexports only 8 per cent,  of her total production.  If she wereto increase  this by only  1 per  cent, this would represent anincreased export of ^&quot;70,000,000 (equivalent to approximately10 per cent, of the  total of British exports) which would meanadditional  heavy  competition  for British   Industry  in  the markets of the world.2.  That in considering the problems of  Inter-Imperial       trade, it is essential  to  take into   account the       economic desires of the Dominions.     The  Federation suggests :     (a) That it is essential that the United Kingdom should realise  that the  Dominions  are  determined to possess asfull an  economic  life as possible, and themselves  developmanufacturing industries.     (b) That the Dominions should, both in their own interestsand in those  of Great Britain, their  most  important market,refrain from developing  industries which  are  economicallyunsound.     The artificial stimulation of uneconomic industries in thelong run damages  the Dominions by raising the cost  of  their primary production, increasing  the general cost of living, andthrowing an  undue  strain upon  the national  finances.  Itdamages  Great Britain  by diminishing her  export  markets,and thus weakening her  power to purchase Dominion products and to provide fresh capital for Dominion development.     (c) That in the case of the establishment of economicallysound industries in the  Dominions  Great  Britain should, inorder  that their  development  may proceed  on British  lines and in accordance with  British standards,  be prepared toassist  with financial  and technical  help,  rather  than leaveforeign countries to do so,
3.   The Importance of Empire  Migration.    The Federation is of opinion :    (a) That  the question of  the  Dominions as a market forBritish goods is bound up with that of migration.  In particular the large per capita purchase of British goods by such countries as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa showsthat, if the population of these countries could be increased bynew settlers of British  origin,  this would inevitably entail a largely increased demand for British  goods.    (b) That  it is fatal to fall into the  error of believing thatthe Dominions are prepared to serve as a dumping-ground forthe unemployed of this country.  Their desire for immigrants,in  so  far as it exists, is based upon their  reasonable wish toincrease the prosperity and development of their own countries.    (c)  That  the  present  position of  Empire migration is extremely  unsatisfactory,  since  state-aided  schemes   foremigration  have largely failed.    (d) That the only real way to stimulate Empire migrationon  a  large  scale  is  to develop the prosperity of  individualDominions,  which,  pari passti. with such  development, willprovide new opportunities for man-power,  and thus facilitatea steady flow of settlers from this country.$.   Reciprocal  trade within the Empire, and the steps      which  can be taken to increase  it.    The Federation is  of  opinion that this question logicallyfalls into two parts, namely :    (l) The  Imperial  machinery for   consultation  uponeconomic questions, and    (2) The future economic policy of  the  Empire.5.   The  Imperial   machinery  for   consultation  upon      economic questions.    It may appear an exaggeration to  insist unduly upon thenature of the machinery by which economic contact is main-tained between the  different parts of the  Empire.   TheFederation  believes,  however,  that this question  is one  of prime  importance, and  that  many of the  difficulties andmisunderstandings which have arisen in the  past have been due to the  lack  of machinery  which  would  permit of  the pursuit of a concerted, co-ordinated and continuing Imperialeconomic policy.   It is true that from time to time there aremeetings of the  Imperial  Conference, and  that  that body,either itself or by means of a subsidiary Economic Conference,pronounces  upon  economic questions, but  this  means  of consultation does not meet the  needs  of the case.
    The  present system  is  open  to the following grave objections :   .-(a) The Conferences  are composed  primarily of thepolitical heads of States and leading officials, who are chieflyand naturally concerned with the political or governmentalaspects of the question to be considered.    (6) No effort has been made to take economic relationsout of the political field.  The policies advocated at imperial conferences in the past by the representatives of the Empire,including those of the  United Kingdom, have  in each beenthe policy of the parties in power, and not agreed  national policies.   No progress  can be  made until Empire trade policy is freed  from the danger of  being  reversed at any moment by political  changes in this country or in any of theDominions.    (c) The main underlying factors governing the economic relations of the Empire have largely been ignored or avoided,and undue attention given to matters of detail.    id) No  machinery  has been devised  for making a con-tinuous study of Imperial economic problems, and ensuring that the work of one Imperial Conference does not  lapse  inthe interval between  it and the next one.    THE  FEDERATION WOULD POINT  OUT THAT  IT  ISA REGRETTABLE FACT THAT BETTER MACHINERY EXISTS,IN CONNECTION WITH THE ECONOMIC  SECTION OF THELEAGUE OF NATIONS, FOR DISCUSSING ECONOMIC  PROB-LEMS  WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES  THAN IS  THE  case with  OUR  SISTER-NATIONS OF  THE  BRITISH EMPIRE.it HOLDS MOST FIRMLY THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS  FLAWIN THE ECONOMIC  ORGANISATION OF THE EMPIRE, ANDTHAT IT MUST AND CAN BE REMEDIED.  it IS OBVIOUSTHAT  IF WE  ARE TO  ARRIVE  AT  A  COMMON POLICYTHERE MUST BE ADEQUATE MACHINERY  FOR CONSULTA-TION, AND THE CREATION OF  SUCH MACHINERY IS THEMOST IMMEDIATE PROBLEM WHICH FACES THE STATESMENOF THE EMPIRE.     The Federation would, therefore, make the followingdefinite  recommendations for  consideration by the nextImperial Conference:     (1) That at as early a date as possible an Imperial Trade Conference  should  be  held of an investigatory, advisory and non-political nature of persons nominated by each Governmentof the Empire, but acting in their personal capacity, composed as follows:
    (a) One  or  more chief  Government officials concernedwith economic and trade questions.    (b) Representatives  of  industry,  both  employers andemployed.    (c)  Representatives of commerce,  finance, shipping and agriculture.    (2) The scope of this Conference to be:    (a) To examine the problem of Inter-Imperial trade witha view to laying down a sound basis for an Imperial economic policy.    AT THIS CONFERENCE  EVERY QUESTION AFFECTINGINTER-IMPERIAL TRADE  SHOULD  BE  BROUGHT  UNDERREVIEW.  IN PARTICULAR AN EFFORT SHOULD BE  MADETO ASCERTAIN DEFINITELY THE VIEWS OE THE DOMINIONSAS TO WHAT FURTHER ADVANTAGES THEY ARE PREPAREDTO GRANT TO BRITISH  TRADE, AND UPON  WHAT TERMSTHEY ARE PREPARED TO  GRANT THOSE  ADVANTAGES.    A clear statement of Dominion views on that point wouldenable the question to be considered  as a whole as a matterof business and not of sentiment, instead of, as at  present,discussions centring  largely  upon what this  country  is,  or may  be,  prepared to do, without any assurance as to themeasure of advantage which may be expected in return.    (b) This  Conference  further to  consider the mass  of detailed questions entering  into Imperial trade relations witha view to drawing up an agenda for discussion  at the nextsucceeding  Imperial Conference,  having due  regard to therelative importance of the questions raised;  the Conference toexpress its views and suggestions with  regard  to the  subjectsforming part of such an agenda.    (c) The Conference to  be investigatory in character, non-political in aim, and  to act purely as a medium for  forming a constructive expression of  opinion on which the governments would pronounce at the subsequent Imperial Conference.    This Conference would be for the Empire what the world economic Conference at Geneva was for the world  at large,but it should be far more productive of results, and would go far to remedy the  defects in organisation which  at presenthandicap  us in our relations  with the  Empire as comparedwith foreign countries.    It should not  be an  isolated effort but a  permanentpart  0/ the Imperial economic  machinery,  and  should inparticular meet before each succeeding Imperial Conference,.in order to study and submit its views upon, the problemsawaiting solution.
     In addition  to the establishment of such Imperial TradeConferences, the  Federation suggests :     (3) That an  Imperial Economic  Secretariat should beestablished, formed of men with economic and administrativeexperience, drawn from  all parts of the Empire,  to act asa  permanent Secretariat  for the Imperial Conferences.  Theduty  of this Secretariat would  be to watch and report uponthe steps taken between Conferences to put into effect decisionsarrived at and to  study both questions raised at  the  precedingConference and  any  new  questions which  might  arise  inthe  interval.   It  would also act  as  the  Secretariat of theImperial Trade Conferences referred to above.   arrangements would have  to   be  made for  bringing the  work  of  thisSecretariat  into  proper relation  with  that  of  the  existingImperial Economic  Committee.     If such a  system were  established we  should  have adequate  machinery,  which to-day we  do not  possess, fordealing with a problem of vital importance, and in view of thesimilarity of race, language and  ideals between the various parts of  the Empire,  it should in practice prove both easy towork and fruitful of results.6.   The future eoonomic policy of the Empire.    This  report  in  the foregoing paragraphs  has  discussed the machinery for economic consultation.   It now remains toconsider the policy which, in the Federation^  opinion, it isdesirable that the Empire should follow.     It is  felt that in  considering  the broad lines of  Empirepolicy, it  is  essential not  to  approach  the problem  froma narrow point of view, but to consider it in the interests ofthe Empire as a whole.   Reciprocal  interchange  of com-modities  is  the goal to aim at, and the  more the volume of empire trade  can be  developed,  and  the prosperity of theEmpire as  a whole increased, the greater will be the advantage from the point of view of each individual unit of the Empire,including the U.K.     There is general agreement that the possibilities of Inter-Imperial trade might be  further  exploited,  but there is nounanimity as to exactly what action is  possible.  One school of thought advocates  doing nothing and leaving the problem to be solved by the ordinary operation of economic  laws.  Ifthe problem were less vital or if the world were  economicallyorganised in a different way to what it is to-day, a policy oflaisser-aller might meet the case, but in present circumstances it is unthinkable.    Another school of  thought  considers that our  present difficulties  might  be solved by the  institution of a system of
free trade within the Empire with a tariff wall outside.  Evenif this may be  an ideal which many may  believe is capableultimately of  realisation, it cannot for many years to come bemore  than a vision  to which, perhaps, various more practicalsteps may gradually lead.    The Federation does not advocate a policy of free tradewithin the Empire as a concrete and practical proposition  tobe ventilated at the Economic Conference,  not  because its members are out of sympathy with the ideal, but because the necessities of the immediate future  should in their view bemet by more practical proposals.    What proposals of a  practical nature is it  possible  to advocate ?  This report has  already  indicated   that, if an imperial Trade Conference such  as it recommends is sum-moned,  an endeavour  should be  made  to ascertain exactly what  further advantages the Dominions are prepared to  offer to the U.K., and upon  what terms, in order that this country may be  in a position to judge what its future action should be.    But apart from this and the Federation has no desire toprejudge the result of such an examination of the problem,nor the decisions which may be come  to in  the light  of theresults of  such an examination there are certain immediate steps which can be taken.    The  Federation  therefore  recommends for  theconsideration   of   the  next  Imperial  Conference  thefollowing suggestions:(a)  That  steps  should be  taken  to &quot; rationalise,&quot;  as far      as possible, Empire industrial production.    It must be admitted  that each Dominion will develop toa greater  or lesser extent its manufacturing  industries.  TheFederation trusts that  each  Dominion will only  foster those industries  which are economically sound, and therefore in thelong run of benefit to the country concerned.  At the presenttime there are  undoubtedly many  industries in various partsof the Dominions which are economically unsound, incapable of continuing without substantial and exaggerated protection,and which are in reality a charge upon the community ratherthan an advantage to  it,  and a handicap  upon the primaryproducer, upon whose success the prosperity of the Dominionsdepends.  The   Federation  would  urge   that   the  variousDominions should consider the extent to which  uneconomicindustries  are in existence and should so shape their policy  as not artificially  to maintain in  existence  such  uneconomicindustries.  The object to aim at should be the rationalisation of  Empire  production, by  which  each  Dominion   shouldmanufacture what she  can with advantage manufacture, and
facilitate  to the utmost the import from Great Britain andother parts of  the Empire of those manufactures which she  isnot capable of producing economically.   To achieve this it  isessential that  individual industries in Great Britain and theDominions  should   together  explore   the  possibilities  ofrationalising their production.   Without such mutual explora-tion of the question within individual industries progress willbe slow, and practical results few and far between.(b)  That  there should be a closer technical liaison between       U.K. and Dominion Industries.    As part of any such scheme of rationalisation steps shouldbe  taken  to develop a  closer technical  liaison between theindustries of  this  country and the  Dominions with a view tocombined effort with regard to such questions as research,standardisation and simplification.(c)  That  existing Preferences  granted by Great  Britain to       the Dominions should not be disturbed.    If  Great  Britain  wishes  to maintain and  extend theadvantages  she at  present possesses in Dominion  markets,the importance of  which has  already  been  stressed, it  isessential  that the  Dominions  should  be  assured that theadvantages which  they at present receive from this country,and to which they  attach the  greatest  importance, will  becontinued in future,  within  the limits  of  the  British fiscalsystem.   If such an assurance cannot be given, and Dominionfears  on this point allayed, progress  towards the developmentof Inter-Imperial trade, with  all its bearing upon the unem-ployment  question in this country, will be seriously prejudiced,and the continuance of the preferences at present accorded bythe Dominions to this country imperilled.    It may be well here, in relation to the  importance ofDominion preferences to Great Britain, to draw attention tothe statement  in  the Report  of the Balfour Committee on industry and Trade that:         &quot; the preservation and development of these advan-    tages must be  one of the cardinal objects  of British    commercial policy.&quot;    Tha  Federation is  in entire accord with the views  of the balfour Committee on this subject.(d)  Empire sources of supply : that  a system  should be       devised whereby knowledge  as  to  these  should be       readily available to all dealers  and retailers  in the       U.K.    The  Empire Marketing Board have undertaken valuablepropaganda urging  the public of  this  country to purchase
 Empire  goods,  but it is suggested that insufficient attention has  been  given to the question of making  it easy for  the supplier in this  country to get into touch with the sources from which these products can be obtained.     It  is  suggested that an organisation should be set up in Great Britain,  financed out  of  the  funds  of  the  Empire Marketing Board,  with  the following  objects :     (l)  To record complete  information as to the quantities and  qualities of Empire  goods  available  and the channels through  which they can be supplied.     (2)  To get  into  direct touch with  dealers and  retailers throughout the country with a view to placing this information at their disposal in order to facilitate their purchase of Empire products.     If  the demand for Empire goods can thus be  stimulated the possibility of obtaining cheaper freight facilities and lower overhead charges by concentrating purchases would be worthy of exploration.   It is therefore suggested that an investigation should be made into the possibility of the better organisation of the purchasing and  distribution of Empire products. (e)  That an Empire College should be established in London.     (1)  The  College  should be of a residential character for the reception  of students from  the  Dominions and Colonies.     (2)  Such students  would  be nominated  by  competent authorities in the Dominions.     (3)  Residence would be for an agreed period, say not less than twelve months.     (4)  Nomination   to the   College  would  include  free transportation, and free living at  the  College.     (5)  The objects of the  College would be to secure for the students that general knowledge with regard to&apos; Great  Britain, her institutions, her industries, her social life, her history and her general conditions, which can only be secured when both time and a certain amount of money are available.     (6) The authorities of the College would  be responsible for  making all arrangements for  the students to follow those lines of  investigation and study in which they were interested,and  for  ensuring  that  they were given the opportunity of deriving  the maximum benefit through their stay, and  forming a just appreciation of the capacities of this country in all its manifold activities.     It is suggested that by the establishment of such a College a widening of outlook on the  part of  the  students attending would result,  which would do much  to strengthen the  tieswhich bind   the  Empire  together.   After  such a  course students  would  return  to  their own  countries  with  a wider
 appreciation of Empire problems, and with enhanced value to their own communities. if)  That steps should be  taken bv His Majesty&apos;s Government       to provide further financial facilities for the further-       ance of air transport within tlie Empire.     The necessity of rapid communication between the various countries of the Empire and within  those countries is self- evident, and an  improvement in communications would be of the greatest benefit to the trade relations of the Empire.  The. possibilities of air transport  offer  the.  greatest hopes for the future, and  it is suggested that immediate and adequate steps should be taken to  stimulate to the utmost air transport during the  next few  years, both  between constituent parts  of  the Empire  and within them.     The foregoing  suggestions are put forward as additional advantages which Great Britain might extend to the Dominions, but itshould be pointed out that quite apart from the preferences at present  granted by this country  to the Dominions, certain other advantages are already derived by them  from the United Kingdom.   For  instance, Great Britain has been,  in the past and will  be in the future,  overwhelmingly the most favourablesource from which the  Dominions can  obtain  the financenecessary for their  development.     By the  operation of the Colonial Stock Act the Dominionsare in a position to obtain money in  the London  market  onthe most favourable terms and under  that Act no  less than^&quot;715,000,000 have  been  provided by Great  Britain.   Theimportance of this free flow of capital cannot be over-estimatedfrom the Dominion point  of view, neither should this countrylose  sight  of  the  fact  that  investment  in  the  Dominionsincreases the  prosperity of Great   Britain&apos;s  best  customers. While the provision of financing facilities to foreign countries in a sound  position cannot be discouraged, British credit is better employed in  sound schemes in the Dominions than in countries whose general  condition  is not so stable and whose economic future is not so obviously linked up with the U.K.as is the case  with the Dominions.     Finally, it may be  well to refer to  the  fact that quite apart  from  commercial  and  financial advantages  offered  bythe U.K. Great Britain is called upon to provide for  the bulkof the cost of the Imperial  Services, which are necessary forthe conduct and defence of  the Empire as a whole.  To takeonly one example, the U.K. pays ^&quot;58,000,000 per  annum  forthe upkeep of the Navy,  which is necessary to  safeguard  the communications of  every  part of  the Empire  with the outside world, and to ensure free  access to and from their markets.

APPENDIX  No.  II.REPORT  OF  THE  ASSOCIATION  OF  BRITISH    CHAMBERS OF  COMMERCE PREPARATORY    COMMITTEE  TO  THE  BRITISH  PREPARA-    TORY   COMMITTEE   FOR   THE  NEXT    IMPERIAL  CONFERENCE.                        REPORT.              The Imperial  Conference.     1.   The Preparatory Committee welcomes the announce- ment that  the Prime Ministers of the Dominions and other representatives of the Dominions and India and of the Crown Colonies and Protectorates of the Empire  will assemble  for an Imperial Conference in the Autumn of the present year.     2.   The Committee is deeply interested in the work of the Imperial Conference, and  especially  in the consideration which it will give to  matters  affecting the. promotion  and development of the trade  of  the Empire and  of each  of its constituent parts.   The Committee trusts  that decisions  will be reached  and made effective for  the  development  of  the resources of the  Empire and for the  furtherance of its  trade.     3.   The &apos;Committee recognises the progress  which  has been made as a result of  the decisions of previous  Imperial Conferences.  It feels, however, that the time has come when the Imperial Conference should take into  its  most serious consideration the  position of  the  trade  relations  existing between  the various parts of the Empire with a-&apos;vi&quot;ew to such procedure being laid down for the future, as will enable those relations  to be discussed-and considered in the light of current events and  current conditions existing  in  each  part  of  the Empire and in foreign countries.  The Committee hopes thatout of such new procedure as may.be determined an effectivepolicy may be laid down.for the guidance of each part  of  the Empire in the future.
     MORE  FREQUENT MEETINGS  OF RESPONSIBLE   REPRESENTATIVES OF THE  GOVERNMENTS OF THE                        EMPIRE.    4.  While recognising that difficulties exist in consequenceof the distances which separate the various parts of the Empireand that the Prime Ministers and other Ministers and represen-tatives require to devote their close attention to the governmentof their Dominions and countries, the Committee feels  thatthe meetings between the responsible  representatives of theEmpire for the discussion of questions affecting the trade ofthe Empire should take place more  frequently.  The presentConferences held, as they are, at intervals of three years donot permit of that close contact which is necessary if the trade of the Empire is to be developed-on progressive lines.   More-over, in the intervals, rapid changes in the trade conditionsthroughout  the  world are  taking  place.  The  Committee,therefore, urges  that meetings should take  place  annually.         THE IMPERIAL ECONOMIC  COMMITTEE.     5.  The Committee  recognises  the  steps which  havebeen  taken by previous conferences for the establishment ofthe Imperial Economic Committee.  The chief function of that committee  is to consider the  possibility  of  improving  themethods of preparing for market and marketing  within  theUnited  Kingdom the food products  of the overseas parts cfthe Empire with a view to increasing the consumption of such products  in the United  Kingdom&apos; in  preference to importsfrom foreign countries.  The Imperial Economic Committeeputs  forward  for  the consideration  of the various Govern-ments concerned   (a)  lists  of  raw materials for possiblefurther  marketing  enquiries  and  (b)  suggestions for  thepreparation and  circulation of  brief preliminary surveys ofany branch of Empire trade and marketing.  The Committeefinds, however, that the functions of the  Imperial  EconomicCommittee  are  advisory  only, and  that it has no executive functions.  The  Imperial  Economic Committee  cannot be looked  upon as an effective  means of  promoting  economic unity in the Empire.           THE  EMPIRE  MARKETING   BOARD.                  EXTENSION  PROPOSED.      6.  The Committee also recognises the steps which have been taken to set up the Empire Marketing Board and desires to record its appreciation of the valuable work done  by this
 Board in furthering  the interests of Empire Trade.   The Committee is of the  opinion  that the time has  come when arrangements should be considered with a view to advertising United Kingdom goods in the Dominions.  As matters stand at the moment overseas Empire Producers of  foodstuffs and raw materials have their goods freely advertised for them in the United Kingdom  while  United Kingdom  manufacturers have  to  rely on  their  own  efforts  to sell  their products throughout the  Empire overseas.     It may be mentioned that as regards fresh fruit alone the total  value  of  imports  from  all  Empire countries  to  the United Kingdom rose  from ^6,873,989 in  1924- to , &quot;8,755,229 in 1928,  whilst imports from all foreign countries  fell from ^26,220,717 in  1924 to ^25,174,475 in 1928.     Some of  the figures for individual  items are very striking. For example, in 1924  the United Kingdom imported 701,899 cwts.  of  Australian apples  valued at ^&quot;1,121,467  whilst in 1928  the  figures had grown  to  1,442,304  cwts. valued at yf2,256,532.   Again, in 1928 the United  Kingdom imported over  a million  bunches  more of bananas from  the British West  Indies than in 1924.   The import of oranges from  the Union of  South  Africa was nearly double in 1928 as compared with 1924.  The same remark applies  to South African pears. The trade had  already shown progressive expansion before the Empire Marketing Board commenced operations in 1927 but the effect  of its work has  undoubtedly been  considerable.    The  Committee  is  fully  aware  of  the  circumstances under which the  Empire Marketing Board was set up and funds placed at its disposal.    The  Committee desires  to urge  that the  work of  the Empire Marketing Board should be reconstituted and extended so that it would undertake the work of  popularising the goods and products  of each  part of the Empire in all other parts. There  should be a system of  contributions  from each part of the Empire towards the cost  of this work.  Its object should be the encouragement  of the exchange of goods  within  the Empire.     7.   Apart   from   the   establishment of  the  Imperial Economic Committee,  the Empire  Marketing Board and  the investigations  recommended by the General  Economic Sub- Committee of the  Conference of  1926, the  Committee  is unable to  find any permanent connecting link between  thegovernments of the various parts of the Empire in relation totrade matters.
  AN  ASSEMBLY OF THE BRITISH  COMMONWEALTH  OF                        NATIONS.      8.  The Committee is  of the  opinion that the ImperialConference should  bring about a complete  overhaul of themachinery at present in existence for consultations on  tradematters between the different parts of the Empire.  Addressingthe members of the  Leicester  Chamber  of  Commerce inNovember, 1929, Sir Gilbert Vyle said:         &apos;&apos; Since the League  of  Nations  was  formed  our    &quot; Government  has sent  with unfailing  regularity every      three  months  to  Geneva its most  prominent Ministers    &quot; to discuss with similar representatives of all the foreign    &quot; governments which are members of the League questions      affecting not only foreign policy but questions affecting    &quot; our trade with foreign countries.   Surely the time has    &quot; come   when  we  should  give as  much  attention at     &apos; conferences either here at home  or  in  one  of our    &apos; Dominions overseas to  trade  questions  affecting the    &quot; development  of our Empire as we do so regularly at     &apos; Geneva to questions affecting our trade  with  foreign      countries.   Let  us  have  regular assemblies of the    &quot; League  known  as  the  Commonwealth  of  British    &quot; Nations.&quot;                          i      9.  The Committee is in agreement with this view andconsiders that the overhaul suggested should include the settingup of regular assemblies of representatives of Great Britain,the  Dominions, India, Crown Colonies, Protectorates andother  parts of the Empire, in specially convened meetings on similar lines  to the meetings at present held at Geneva of therepresentatives of the various governments which are membersof the League of Nations.    10.  The   League  of  Nations has formed under itsauspices an Economic Committee for the purpose of consider-ing and discussing and eventually of bringing about agreements and conventions between countries  on matters affecting their industries, trade, finance and shipping.  It is well known, too,that the International  Labour Office  has  been constituted under the Treaty of Versailles at  Geneva for the  purpose of reaching agreement in  matters affecting  the  interests of theworkers  in all industries and  in all  lands.  The Committeeconsiders that  the  steps  taken in  these directions  by theLeague  of  Nations  may have far-reaching  effects on theinterests of this country and of each part of the. Empire.    11.  The  Committee  feels that similar steps  should be
 taken to  promote the  interests  of  the  Empire and  of  each of  its parts.    The  Committee,  therefore,  recommends the setting up of an organisation which might be known as the Empire Trade Assembly and that this body should make the necessary arrangements for Assemblies or  Conferences of responsible representatives of the different parts of the Empire to  meet at regular  intervals for the discussion of questions affecting  the trade of the Empire.     12.   The  Committee believes  such an Assembly would be  of  great advantage in the consideration of  the problem of how  the  whole  trade of  the  Empire  might  be developed. Within this Assembly  there, could, if  thought desirable, be formed a special section wherein the economic effect of the trade  policy of  each part of the  Empire, including Great Britain,  as affecting the  whole, might be  considered   and discussed.  This section should bring into consultation repre- sentatives of  particular  industrial, commercial, financial, shipping,  agricultural and  other interests within each  part of  the Empire.  The Committee, therefore, urges that,  upon the formation  of the new  Assembly,  this question should receive early attention.     13.   The Committee has noted that at the assemblies of the  League  of  Nations, the  governments  of  the  various countries  are constantly represented by  responsible Ministers. The Committee believes that it would be to the advantage of each part  of the Empire if a new ministerial post was  created, the occupant of  which  would  devote his attention solely to questions  affecting  the  trade of the  Empire and that  this Minister  should  be  the  responsible  representative  at  the meetings referred to.     14.   The Committee believes that  the setting up of the new Assembly would have  many advantages among which may be mentioned the possibility of the establishment within it of an Empire Trade Information Bureau for the purpose of collecting  and  supplying direct  to  all  parts of the  Empireinformation of value in the promotion of its trade.          A TRADE POLICY  FOR  THE EMPIRE.     15.   The Committee considers that the first step to betaken  is  to  set  up  the  new  machinery suggested  for  thepurpose  of  frequent consultation.  This in itself would  be helpful to the various governments and tend towards progressin the  development of  Empire Trade.   The  Committeeconsiders, however,  that  when this machinery has been setup its most important function  must be to consider and devise,
if  possible, a  trade policy within  the Empire  and for  theEmpire which will  bring about the  constant  growth anddevelopment of each of its  parts.   The  Committee appendsto this report a number of  suggestions for consideration.     16.  The Committee considers that  attention  should begiven by the responsible representatives of the Empire to theproposal to form a European  Economic Union.  A union of states for trade purposes has been suggested.  The suggestionthat such a Union should be constituted points to the urgent necessity of  closer consultation between  the various parts ofthe  Empire  on  trade  matters.  The competition between countries is becoming keener each day.   This Economic Unionhas been suggested as a  means of defence against economicdomination.   Its formation might have important consequencesupon the trade of each part of  the Empire, and it is therefore desirable that consideration should be given  at the  earliest moment to the proposal and  its possible consequences upon thetrade of the British Empire  in the future.       VARIOUS SUBJECTS  FOR  CONSIDERATION.    17.  The Committee desires to suggest that the following subjects should be considered by the next Imperial conference with a view to the removal  of  such  restrictions on  trade asmay be necessary for the furtherance of the trade of thevarious parts of the Empire.COMMERCIAL TREATIES BETWEEN  GREAT  BRITAIN or       THE DOMINIONS AND FOREIGN  COUNTRIES.    18.  This question  arises from  the  Treaty concludedbetween the Union of South Africa and Germany under whichthe latter country would secure the benefit of any future newpreference accorded to the United  Kingdom.    This subject is one of fundamental character at  the rootof all questions of greater inter-Empire co-operation.    The Committee are of the opinion that there should be full consultation and agreement between  the various govern-ments of the Empire before the terms of  a commercial treaty between one  part of the Empire and another country are concluded.
CONDITIONS  OF  THE  MARKETING  AND  DISTRIBUTING           OF THE  AUSTRALIAN WOOL CLIP.    19.  This  matter  has formed the subject of  a specialmemorandum drawing attention to the mutual interdependenceof  Australia as the world&apos;s largest producer  of  fine wool andthe United Kingdom as her largest buyer.    After referring to the serious adverse factors operating inthe woollen trade, the memorandum advocates  that economies in  production, in marketing and in distribution are necessaryto  save the industry.    It is suggested  that the first economy is needed at the source of production  and  that this is a  local problem for theAustralian Government and  Growers.   Reference is made tothe difficulty of selling  the Australian export at world valuesand the increasing competition  from artificial silk.    As regards the severe losses which have been suffered inrecent years by the fluctuations in values at consuming centres,attention is drawn to  the adverse  factor  arising from  thepresent system  of offering 90  per cent, of the wool clip byauction  in  Australia in place of the old  system of  a series of four or six  auctions  in  the  year  and the offering of a largeproportion of the clip in London.   More equal distribution in marketing is urged as an indispensable factor in re-establishing the position, either by sending more  wool to London, whereworld demand is always available, or  by more  equal offeringsthroughout the year at the source of supply.    Finance and holding the clip whether by grower or buyeris  still the pivotal consideration in distribution.    The Committee considers  that  the   facts  of  the position should be  brought  to  the   attention  of  those  concerned,especially the following points          1.   Any  schemes  which   would  avoid   extreme    fluctuations in value and help towards a more reasonable    stabilisation of values would be most servicable.         2.   Efforts towards a reduction  of costs of production    and distribution have become urgent.              COMMERCIAL  INTELLIGENCE.    20.  One-aspect of the problem of greater co-operation .in  commercial  intelligence services  was brought before theAssociation by the Hull Chamber which tabled a resolutionwith the object of securing  the appointment  of  CommercialAgents or Sub-Agents of the Dominions  at the principal ports and manufacturing  centres  of the United Kingdom and of
similar  appointments of United Kingdom representatives inthe Dominions.     The  practical  application of the idea contained in theHull resolution  would be  an even  greater extension of thepresent Trade Commissioner services of the United kingdom in the Overseas Empire than that recently announced, as -veilas of the existing Dominion official trade representation in theUnited Kingdom.     Apart from the immediate financial  considerations thereis a great deal to be said for the suggestion  on broad ground?and its application  would  still further remove the anomaloussituation  which existed  in the  past  that more official  helpwas  available  in  Empire  countries  to  the foreign traderthrough the existence  of  foreign Consuls  than was available through a single  Trade Commissioner  to  the British traderhimself.     There is an interesting method  at present in operation asbetween  the  United  Kingdom and Kenya.   The  trade commissioner has an office in London and in Nairobi, betweenwhich his time is apportioned.     Consideration might  also  be  given  to  a proposal thatbranches of the Department  of  Overseas Trade might be setup in each of the Dominions  and the more important crown colonies with a view to furnishing this country with better tradeinformation and assisting  to a  greater extent than at presentin the  development of British trade with those parts of the Empire.   The staffs might include  special men  to look afterthe interests of particular  export trades in the Dominions.               IMPERIAL PENNY  POSTAGE.     21.   The Committee desires to  suggest  that it would be a helpful gesture if the  various parts of the Empire  would agree  to  the  adoption  of an  Imperial Penny  Postage.r.]c&apos;;&apos;: New Zealand and Canada have penny postage.   It  is possible  for New Zealanders and Canadians to  send a  closed packet  to : any  part  of   the  Empire for one  penny.   It  is suggested that the time.has come when the British Government and the  governments of  other parts of  the Empire should respond to the.examples set by New Zealand and Canada and enable the people of the Empire  with  the  least expense  to communicate, with British peoples in all parts of the Empire.                 . IMPERIAL&quot; PARCEL POST.  .-; &quot;--22.-  The Committeerdraws attention to. the high charges-for parcels to the&apos; Dominions  from this country as compared
156ith the charge from Germany and the same countries whichare as follows :English Rate 5ko.JamaicaAustraliaCeylonEgyptCanadaIndiaS.

Rate lOko.12/1012/1012/1012/1012/1012/1012/10     The Postmaster-General has stated that  there was little prospect of  any reduction in British parcel post charges onparcels for places abroad but that the scales are under constant review.     Parcels  exceeding  11 lbs.  in  weight cannot  be sent  toAustralia, Egypt or  South  Africa.  The  Committee would wish to urge that steps should be taken to effect a reductionin the  charges for postal parcels in order to bring our chargesinto line with those of Germany, and that it should be possiblefor a 22 lbs.  parcel to be sent from any part of  the  Empire toany other part of the Empire.    The Postmaster-General has informed the Association ofBritish Chambers of Commerce that the  postage rates charged on parcels for places abroad are composed of three items :         1.   A uniform charge  for  handling and conveyance    in this country.         2.   The actual cost of conveyance to the country of    destination by sea and through any intermediate countries.         3.   The sum  required by the Postal  Administration    of the country of destination to defray the cost of  handling    and conveyance in  that country.It would therefore appear that a reduction in the  total charges for parcels might  be secured by a  preferential  treatment of&apos;imperial parcels by  the Government  of each  part of theEmpire (under Item 3).         COMMERCIAL TRAVELLERS&apos;  LICENCES.    23.  In a  number  of Dominions and Colonies, a licence fee or analogous charge is imposed on commercial travellers,including Union of South Africa, Newfoundland (municipal),Southern Rhodesia, Irish Free State (excisable articles), NewZealand, Kenya, Nyasaland,  Tanganyika, British Honduras(municipal),   Saint   Lucia  (municipal),  Fiji,  Mauritius,
Bechuanaland, Basutoland, Swazieland, South West  Africa,Northern Rhodesia.    Of these, the heaviest Government levied fees are in theUnion  of  South  Africa,   Northern Rhodesia,  SouthernRhodesia, Kenya, and Tanganyika among the larger markets.    These fees are levied in various instances on the residentsof the country as well as on travellers from  overseas.  TheCommittee urges that the levying of these fees in relation tointer-Imperial Trade may be considered.                  TRADE CATALOGUES.    24.  The complaint in this case  is not general as thedifficulty  is  confined,  as  regards  important  markets,  toAustralia and Newfoundland.    Australia charges a customs duty of 1/- per lb., or 45per cent, ad valorem on British Catalogues,  whichever yieldsthe higher duty, and Newfoundland  charges a customs dutyof 5 cents per lb. plus a surtax of 5 per cent, ad valorem.As regards Australia, the preference margin is 6d. per lb., or10 per  cent, ad  valorem in favour of British as  againstforeign catalogues.     A resolution of the 1923 Imperial Economic Conferencerecommended free of duty admission of single copies of tradecatalogues and price lists of firms having an  established placeof business within the  Empire sent by post or with consign-ments of goods from any part of the Empire to business firms in any other part  of  the Empire provided they are  the tradecatalogues and  price lists  of firms or  persons not having an established place  of business  in  the  territory to which thecatalogues are sent.     It seems desirable to  urge that Australia and Newfound- land should come  into line by relaxing their present restrictive policy.       TAXATION OF AGENTS  IN THE DOMINIONS.    25.  The Committee  desires again  to  urge  that  thesubject of  the  taxation  of  British  firms  trading in  theDominions should be considered by the Imperial Conference.    In 1926 the  Association  made special representations onthis question and submitted a full memorandum setting outthe whole position.  (See Association&apos;s Imperial ConferenceReport, 1926, p. 79.)    This question of the taxation of non-resident traders wasconsidered  by  a special Sub-Committee  of  the  ImperialConference,  1926, and their report was as follows :
     SUMMARY OF THE IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS AND    CONCLUSIONS OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE IMPERIAL  CONFERENCE AS SET OUT IN THE REPORTS APPROVED BY THE                   CONFERENCE (1936).    Taxation of Non-Residcnt Traders. The  committee referred to the diversity of method  in the  various parts ofthe Empire in the computation of  the profits for taxationpurposes of a manufacturer or producer resident in one partof the Empire who sells his goods through an agent or branchin another part.    The manufacturer  or producer is subject to taxation in both countries, though  his  burden  is eased  by arrangementsalready made between many parts of  the Empire for relief inrespect of double taxation.  As between the Home Governmentand the  Governments of other parts  of the  Empire the costof relief falls either wholly or mainly upon the Exchequer ofGreat Britain.    The Committee went on  to state that the total profit ofthe manufacturer or producer which finally emerges on thesale of his goods abroad may be regarded  a.s consisting of(1) the &quot; manufacturing &quot; or &apos; producing &quot; profit which arises from activities exercised at home, and (2) the &quot; merchanting &quot;profit which arises from activities exercised in  the country of sale (i.e. abroad).    There was  general,  though  not  complete,  agreement among the members of the Sub-Committee that such a division was desirable, and that the  scope of the charge to income taxin the country of  sale might  with advantage be restricted tothe &quot; merchanting &quot; profit.  This is  the principle  adopted inGreat Britain and Northern  Ireland under the  Income Tax.Act, 1918, and it was reported to the Committee that a similarprinciple of taxing only part of the profits of the non-residentmanufacturer also underlies the laws of some or  all  of theDominions, though not in every case  those Provincial or StateGovernments within these Dominions.    The representatives of India were unable to accept the.principle and  it was pointed out  by the  representatives of&quot;Canada and the Australian  Commonwealth that they were notin a position to speak on behalf  of, or  to  bind Provincial orStafe Governments.    It will be noted from  this report  that there was generalagreement at the Imperial Conference, 1926, that the scopeof the charge to income tax in the country of sale  might with advantage be restricted to the merchanting profit.
     This is the  scheme now adopted by our own InlandRevenue.  It must also be noted that in the case of ourDominions  it is  possible to obtain reliefs in the  form ofa repayment or set-off to the extent of:         (a)  Where the rate of Dominion  Income Tax is less     than  half the appropriate  British Tax the whole of the     Dominion Income Tax paid is remitted here.         (b)  Where the  rate  of  Dominion Income Tax is     greater than  half the appropriate British  rate then half     the appropriate British rate is remitted.     It is clear, however, that this  form of taxation,  necessi-tating as  it does,  the filling  up of taxation returns  to many countries with which Great Britain is  trading causes a greatdeal of trouble and annoyance to  exporters.   It is  difficult for a firm in Great Britain to state  accurately the amount of profit which has been  made  in its trading with any  givencountry.     Double  Taxation,  even  if a  system of relief  to  easesuch taxation be universally adopted,  must prevent  the freeinterchange of commerce within the Empire.     The Committee urges the desirability at the forthcoming imperial Conference of coming  to  a mutual agreement  withthe Dominions for the reciprocal exemption from taxation ofnon-resident firms trading through resident agents.

APPENDIX  A.               EMPIRE  TRADE  POLICY.           Memorandum by SIR EDWARD ILIFFE, C.B.E.     The  British  Preparatory  Committee has  been  appointed, I understand, to consider the general  subject of Empire  Trade, to formulate a policy which, in its opinion, will bring the greatest measure  of prosperity to the  various  constituent  parts  of  the Empire, and, if possible, to make  unanimous  recommendations to His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to such a policy.     At the  very outset, we ask ourselves what, broadly, are  the conditions which would best  tend to bring about what we  want ? The answer cannot well be in doubt.  The ideal at  which to aim is  surely  a  self-supporting  Empire, with the greatest possible freedom of trade within that Empire.     For what are the alternatives ?  One is an Empire composed of a number of self-contained, self-supporting states.  Some such units might well exist and even flourish ; but  they could not con- stitute the  British Empire, for Great Britain herself could never form one of them.  The population of these islands is so great that at the most the soil can only produce food  sufficient  for from one-third to one-half of the inhabitants; and so we are driven to export the  skill of our artisans, in  the  form  of goods  wholly  or partly manufactured,  in order  to create credits overseas  wherewith to purchase the balance of the food required.     Again,  an Empire  with complete freedom of  trade within its borders might have  been an ideal in a time long past; but, to  my mind, it is now quite  out of reach.   We shall never pursuade  the Dominions to give up altogether the protection of their secondary industries;  indeed, under any  system, some measure of protection of new  industries during  their development and growth  might be economically necessary and sound, provided that  such  protection did not continue indefinitely.    The third alternative is to  leave the whole  thing  to chance, or to the schemes and devices of other nations. This it is the function of the Preparatory Committee to combat.    A self-supporting Empire, with the greatest possible freedom of trade within that Empire, holds out the best prospect of a raised standard of living.   This it does because, while it must tend  to increased production  and  increased   consumption, our   home workers are protected from the competition  which is most injurious of all, namely, that which comes from workers in foreign countries who  are  prepared to  work longer hours, under worse conditions, and for lower pay than those in the British Empire.    To bring about such a result, all  barriers to trade which existwithin  the Empire itself must be  reduced as far  as ever it is practicable,  and this reduction can only  be  brought about&apos;  by discussion  and negotiation.  If this is  to be accomplished, thepeople of this country must be  induced and enabled to look at thesubject, not  only from their  own standpoint, but also from the standpoint of the people of the  Dominions themselves.   Similarly,the people of the Dominions will have to consider it from the  point&apos;of view of Great Britain as well as from their own. -............
    Something has been accomplished when it is recognised thatthere are two such viewpoints, and that they may be widely different.While we in the home  country realise that a self-contained, self-supporting Great Britain is an impossibility, we must  realise thatthis does not apply to Canada or Australia.  A self-contained, self-supporting Canada or Australia is perfectly conceivable.  Either ofthese great countries can feed its own population, and for anythingwe can see to the contrary, may be able to do so for all  time, while,as far as manufactured requisites are concerned, they could providefor  their own  wants,  although  probably  they  could not do so  aseconomically as if they were purchased from this  country, with  ouraccumulation of industrial skill and experience.  So that the Empireproblem  which  we  are considering presents itself to  a Britonoverseas  in an aspect entirely different from that in which it is seen by us here in Great Britain.    When I was in Australia I discussed these matters quite franklyat the Chambers of Commerce  in Sydney and Melbourne.   At first was  told that the only thing we in Great Britain could do whichmight prevent Australia from pursuing the policy of protecting  hersecondary industries to the utmost, and so gradually becoming self-contained, would be to give Empire primary produce in  our markets3 preference over similar  produce  arriving on our shores  from outside the British Empire.    I pointed out that  although the people in this country wouldnot consent to any tax  on food, and  that therefore we were unableto give Australians a  preference of that  nature,  still we  wereprotecting  them in another way, at the expense of the  British tax-payer,  and that  they therefore  should, in return,  make it possiblefor  us  to sell our manufactured goods in  their   own  country inreasonable quantities,  as  on  this our  very  existence depended.I found a general agreement with my argument.    The protection referred to,  a very vital one, is of course that ofthe British Navy.  A country like Australia which, compared withits immense size, has a relatively small  population, cannot by itsown efforts alone provide a navy  which  would  afford  adequate protection.  With eastern lands having most urgent populationproblems of their own, Australia, had she not been an integral partof the British Empire, must long ago have ceased to exist except asan Oriental country.  As a constituent part of the Empire, however,she at once shares in the protection which  such  a  partnershipaffords and, incidentally, makes that protection more efficient thanit would be without her.    While Australia and  the other  Dominions are proud  of their membership of  the Empire,  there is in some quarters, fortunatelynot in all, a tendency to advocate an economic policy based on theneeds  or interests of the Dominion  as a unit rather than on thoseof the Empire in which it is a partner.  But we, in this country,aire open to precisely the same criticism.  Our reluctance to  givea preference to  Empire produce shows that we, too, are taking  the narrow view.   In  spite of  all that has  happened in  the  past,I. personally feel that it is a mistake for us to take it  for granted that this country will never consent to put  a duty upon foreignfoodstuffs.  Should it once be  made clear that a policy of EmpireCreference will bring greater  prosperity, not only to our own people,  ut to the British  Dominions  as a whole, we  may reconsider thatconclusion, just as in the  past we  have reconsidered others  that were once looked upon  as irrevocable.
    This, however, is for the time being beside the mark.  what we have to  do is  to endeavour to  free ourselves from traditionalbonds and political  prejudices, and to find the policy which, if adopted, would bring the  greatest  prosperity  to  the Empire  asa whole.  Having found it, we  must strive  to make it as palatableas we can, alike to the people of Great Britain and  to the people ofthe Dominions beyond the seas.    In doing this,  we must recognise differences of view-point.  Itis these which make a policy  of complete free trade within theEmpire  impossible.  We cannot expect the Dominions to allow ourmanufactured  goods to  be  imported freely, since this would makeit impossible for them to carry on the industries which have been set  up under the shelter of a highly protective system.  But vvith-out  asking them  to take such  sweeping steps  as these, we can atleast negotiate with  them,  offering  a preference for their produceover foreign food imported by us, and so no doubt gradually gettingthem to agree, not merely to an increase of the preferences whichthey give us at the present time over manufactured imports, but toa scaling down of the duties  themselves.  After all, there is no advantage in a large difference in  the height of two tariff walls ifthe  lower one is itself unscalable.    If we could  induce  the Dominions to lower the tariffs on ourmanufactured  goods,  by ourselves  imposing a duty upon foreignfood coming into this country, it becomes a question how we can make such a proposal palatable  to the people at home.  Personally,I believe that this can best be done by making it quite clear thatany  duty on foreign foodstuffs coming to  our shores will be used,not for general revenue purposes, but with the single definite objectof cheapening the cost of home produced food. This might bedone by  subsidising  the cultivation of arable land, making thesubsidy depend upon the sum actually realised  as  duty on foreignfood reaching this country.    Our artisans and those who live in urban districts have in thepast been most  opposed  to any duty upon imported foodstuffs.But  when it is made  clear to  them that the reason we are losingour  export  trade  is because  we have done nothing to help oarDominions to sell their primary produce to  us, and if we did help them to do so they, in return, would increase the purchase of ourmanufactured goods, then,  I think  the &quot;urban dwellers  would beamong  the  first to advocate the imposition of a small duty uponforeign  food.     It may be contended that in spite of the fact that the proceeds of such duty are applied  exclusively  to  the cheapening of home produced food, the cost of food would nevertheless rise ;  but thepossibility of any considerable increase in price would be minimisedby this  expedient, and the increased prosperity which would followwould, I think, make the arrangement well worth while.  It certainlywould be far more palatable to  the public if they could count uponthe fact that not one penny raised by duties on foodstuffs  cominginto this country would be used for revenue purposes, but  that thewhole of such revenue would be used to help to cheapen and toimprove the production of food in Great Britain.     I am not sure that the Empire Marketing Board might notutilise their posters with effect if they were to teach the british public a few simple economic truths, such as the following :         i.  However well we  till our soil  in Great Britain we can     only produce sufficient food to feed one-third of our population.
    2.  We must export manufactured goods in order to pay for*the food to feed the other two-thirds.    3.  Since  the war foreign countries have increased theirtariffs  and  are thereby  preventing  us  from  sending ourmanufactured goods to them.    4.  We must therefore increase our manufactured exportsto our Dominions, but they cannot be expected to help us tosell more to them if we will not help them to sell their primaryproduce to us.    5.  If we  cannot sell our  manufactured goods and so buyfood for  the two-thirds of our population we cannot feed, theonly other course is to export the population itself, which is notpractical politics.APPENDIX  B.     MEMORANDUM  ON  THE  PROPOSAL  BYSIR  ROBERT  HADFIELD,  BT,  FOR AN EMPIRE               DEVELOPMENT  BOARD.    Sir Robert Hadfield proposes  that an  Empire  development board be formed with representatives from all  parts of the Empireand with a permanent organisation and personnel in each country.The  Board should meet frequently, both in Great Britain and thevarious Dominions and Colonies.   Members of the Board shouldbe paid.  Each member should be elected for a minimum periodof two  or three years.  No  considerations  of time, distance orexpense should be allowed to affect the setting up of a permanent organisation devoted solely to the work of  Empire Development.    The Board&apos;s work should include development on the broadestpossible lines.  It should  devote special attention to the work of expansion by assisting the opening  up of new  means of  transport,railways, tramways, roads, harbours, docks, canals, power plant,the foundation of new industries, opening new districts for farming,controlling forestry, etc.  The ultimate control and operation shouldbe in the hands of the countries concerned.  Appropriations wouldbe set aside  for the execution of development projects approvedby  the Board, and when completed  the undertaking  would  be handed over  along with capital obligations  to the appropriate authority or company which would  ultimately control and  operate.Loans might  be  raised  with  the guarantee of the Board.   Thebenefits of such  a policy would be that  projects overseas whichin present circumstances would have to wait for years before being undertaken through lack of  capital would quickly  be  made pro-ductive. The United Kingdom would benefit from the developmentof  employment  provided at home  and  new  opportunities  foremigration.    The Board should  be  independent  of party  politics.   an empire Development Fund should  be  raised and administered bygeneral  agreement  between  the representatives of  the various countries.  The time is long overdue for really active  developmentof Empire resources.
APPENDIX  No. III.MEMORANDUM   CONTRIBUTED   ON  BEHALF    OF THE SHIPPING INDUSTRY TO A STATE-    MENT  IN  PREPARATION  BY  THE  JOINT    COMMITTEE   OF  THE   ASSOCIATION   OF    BRITISH CHAMBERS  OF  COMMERCE, THE    FEDERATION  OF  BRITISH   INDUSTRIES,    THE  CHAMBER  OF   SHIPPING  OF   THE    UNITED KINGDOM, ETC., FOR THE IMPERIAL    CONFERENCE, 15TH JANUARY, 1930.1.  General Economic Policy in Relation to Shipping.    The Shipping Industry submitted a full statement of theirviews in regard to imperial economic policy as affecting  themto the Imperial Economic Conference in  1923 and  to theImperial  Conference, 1926.  All  that has happened since has confirmed those  views  which  were  endorsed by the  final report of the Committee on Industry and Trade published inMarch, 1929.  For convenience the views expressed  both bythis Committee and by the Industry are briefly recapitulatedas follows :    The  Committee  on Industry and Trade emphasise  the dependence of Great Britain upon her Overseas Trade.  they state:        &quot; During the  past century there has been a steady    growth in our dependence on Overseas supplies for  the    essential means of  existence and there is not the slightest    reason to expect that the tendency will be  arrested or    reversed in the near future,&quot;and they  conclude that         &quot; If  we  are to obtain  from abroad the food and    materials which  are essential to maintain the standard of    living and continuity of employment of our population    we must preserve and extend our means of access to    Overseas  markets and so  maintain  and  increase  our    efficiency as  to produce our exports at minimum real cost    having regard to  quality and suitability for  their market.&quot;
     After reviewing conditions in  foreign markets the Com-mittee point out that between 40 and 50 per cent, of our total exports are directed to Empire markets and that the preferen-tial tariffs of the Dominions are on the average less than their general tariffs  by  approximately 9  per cent, ad valorem.Australia, Canada, New Zealand  and  South  Africa  taken together purchase British goods to an  amount equal to nearly 6 per head of their  population, as  compared  with  10s. for france, Germany and  the  United States.  As a buyer  ofBritish manufactured exports one Australian is worth  twenty-two citizens of the United States.  The  Committee  conclude that-         &quot; The great value and importance to British traders     of the preferential  access which they enjoy to certain     Empire markets &quot;puts it beyond doubt that          &quot; The preservation and development of these advan-     tages. must  be one of the cardinal  objects of British     commercial policy.&quot;     The Committee state that they          &quot; Believe  that the necessary  basis  of  all  sound     commercial  relations  among the  states of the British     Empire is the full and general recognition of the principle     that prior regard is due to the essential needs and interests     of the home population,&quot;and  after  reviewing  the  reciprocal  advantages  derived  by great Britain  and  the Dominions  from their relations as members of the Empire they conclude          &quot; The whole question of imperial economic relations     would be raised to a  higher plane if it were  generally     recognised that,  within the family of states constituting     the British  Commonwealth, it is the duty and interest of     each state, subject always to the safeguarding of its own     essential economic life, to do everything possible, without     reference to any exact bargaining equivalence, to promote     the prosperity of the Commonwealth as  a whole.&quot;     In their Memorandum of 1926 the Shipping Industry laid it down as their first principle that           &quot; They would welcome a solution  (of the economic     problems of the  Empire) based entirely upon  the broad      economic interests of the Empire as a whole.&quot; They pointed out  that  Great Britain is, except in the case of Canada, by  far the  biggest buyer of the  exports  of  ^he
Dominions, and even in  the case  of  Canada, Great  Britainbuys one-third of her exports.  On the other hand, howevertrue it may be that the Dominions possess land and  climateenabling them to produce  all the imported wheat  and mostof the imported meat and dairy produce consumed  in  thiscountry, their limited populations prevent this being  dpne toadvantage, since it is obvious that even jf all the importedfood consumed by Great Britain were raised in the Dominionswe  could never buy  it, as there is  not a sufficient number ofbuyers in the Dominions to consume the only thing we could offer in exchange, namely, our manufactures.   Practically thewhole of our supplies of jute, about four-fifths of our  importsof wool and of rubber, three-quarters of our imports of nuts andkernels, and half our imports of hides are contributed by theEmpire.  On the other hand, the proportion of cotton and ofwood pulp obtained from the Empire  is only about one-tenthfand of timber one-twentieth; whilst imports of iron ore and petroleum are almost wholly derived from foreign countries.    The Industry commented upon the fact brought out bythe  Committee on Industry and Trade in their  Survey  of overseas Markets, published in 1925, that         &quot; The main increases of tariff rates on British  exports    have been within the British  Empire where the average    ad  valorem  incidence has  risen  by nearly two-thirds,    while in  foreign  countries  despite the great  increase in    the United States tariff the average ad valorem incidence    has decreased by one-fifth.&quot;    Since that was written  there have been further increases.in Dominion tariffs and recently particularly heavy increasesshave  been made in   the  Australian  tariff.   The  Industry&apos;sMemorandum continued:        &quot; The tariffs imposed  and the extent to  which the    preference is allowed,  are  deliberately calculated  to    promote in every way possible production  within Canada,    Australia and South Africa; and as this policy is realised,    our ability to purchase from them our supplies  of foqd    and raw material must decrease,&quot;    The Committee  on Industry and Trade noted that         &quot; The growth of manufacture in the less  industrially    developed  countries  undoubtedly represent  permanent    tendencies with which  traders must inevitably reckon in    future and to which  it is  therefore essential  that they    should strive with all  their power to accommodate their    outlook, their methods and  their organisation.&quot;
     On this the Industry commented as follows-       -&apos;    If the  traders and shipowners of this country are:  &apos;-&quot;  to act on this advice they rhust be left to strive with all     their power with the trade of the world, and without that   -  trade  being hampered by artificial restrictions created to&apos;  1  &apos; foster trade with some countries at the expense of others.     The more the  self-governing Dominions will buy  our     exports the more must we take their exports in exchange;&quot;*&apos;   but on the other hand  the more they shut put by their&apos;     tariffs the manufactures of our staple  industries the less    &quot;-shall we be able to  buy from them, as we have nothing    &apos; else to offer in payment.&quot;&apos;  .   Shipowners realise&apos; that &quot; the growth of manufacture&quot; inthe Dominions &quot; represents  a permanent tendency.&quot;  At theSame&apos; time  they appreciate that  Empire marketing is one ofthe most vital problems affecting each of the Dominions andGreat&apos; Britain as well, and they think, that  it will  be  readilyconceded, that Overseas transport  is an essential element inEmpire  marketing.  The  needs  of the Dominions&apos; for cheaparid -efficient sea  transport  services  have  frequently  been emphasised, and while British shipowners are satisfied that atthe moment they are supplying this need yet the continuanceof transport  efficiency and  still&apos;  more of  -cheap  transportdepends upon the regular supply of full cargoes from  as wellas to Great Britain.   In other words, the efficiency of Empiretransport upon which the  success of Empire marketing largelydepends, is itself dependent upon the efficient organisation ofsuch marketing so that a regular and  sufficient flow of tradeboth from the Dominions to Great Britain and from GreatBritain to the Dominions  is secured.           -  :2.&apos;  Overseas Settlement within the. Empire.    Changed economic conditions in some Dominions, e.g.,Australia,-&apos; by  producing  unemployment  have  temporarilystqpped  emigration.   British interests realise that emigrationis primarily  a question for the country of immigration andtbat it is useless, even  if it were possible, to transfer surpluslabour in one part&quot;of-&apos; the Empire to another part unless that part  is  able and willing to absorb it.   On the other hand theDominions who find  themselves faced with difficulty in regardto immigration will  appreciate the difficulty  of  Shipowners,who  having provided expensive ships for the &quot;carriage oferhigrants,  are faced with the  sudden  stoppage  of emigranttraffic! - Such ships  have to pay their way in good  times andin bad; and if the emigrant traffic to a Dofniniqn is stopped itcannot expect either the same passenger services or the samecargo services as-before.
     The Shipping  Industry  in  their Memorandum of  1926pointed out that                                        : ;         &quot;The facilities for  the carriage of emigrants which     can be provided depend in great measure upon the volume     of  inward and outward cargoes offering, for such cargoes     must be forthcoming if regular sailings are to  be main-     tained and the cost of  transporting  the emigrants is to be     kept within their means.&quot;Conversely  the  ability to maintain  regular sailings for the carriage of cargo depends to some extent upon the  ability to fill the space provided and reserved for emigrants.        &apos;  &apos;3.  Double Taxation.     In 1926  the Shipping Industry expressed  their  views onthis subject as follows:               -      ,          .    v         &quot; Shipowners have no  desire to avoid taxation   i     they share with all industries the strongest objection to     being  taxed more than once on the  same profit,  and  they     protest most strongly on being taxed on imaginary profits     which are never in fact made.&quot;                       &apos; :     In  its relations with foreign countries Great Britain has met this objection by co-operating in the creation of a seriesof agreements for the reciprocal exemption Of shipping fromdouble  taxation  on  the basis of taxing  in the country  of&quot; residence &quot;  only.    Of such agreements  between  different countries  there  are  now no  less than  42.   In urging  theadoption of taxation  according  to &quot;residence&quot; British ship-owners, so far from securing a profitable  immunity from income Tax,  have  submitted to be taxed at the highest levelof taxation in the world.   Canada has consistently taken theview  that one of the best ways of attracting the services ofcapital  from  non-residents  at the lowest possible cost to itself is not to tax  it.  She has attached the  highest importance to securing the best and most economical services  from shipping.By  leaving shipping to pay tax  in its own country be  it  highor low she  has obtained full advantage  from the open freightmarkets of the world.  This principle has not been adopted inrecent years by other Dominions.     Some  have imposed  so-called Income   Taxes  uponhypothetical  and indeed non-existent profits.   This was notdeliberately intended and with  a view to providing a betterassessment based on the actual profits of the enterprise, theImperial Economic Conference  in 1923 unanimously adopted and  recommended  for  those  taxing non-resident  shipping,means for assessment and apportionment upon a certificate bythe Government of  the country of residence.   This arrange-ment has now been  adopted  and is operating in India  and
 South  Africa.  It has not been adopted in Australia where the suggestion has recently been made that while the certificate provided for by the Imperial Economic Conference would not be  acceptable &quot; the  Government (New  South Wales) would be willing to accept a certificate  of the actual profits.  .  .   . It should be possible to discover a basis upon which a certifi- cate of profits would be acceptable.&quot;   It will, however, be recalled that it  was  precisely because of  the  difficulty of ascertaining  the  actual  profits  whose   &quot;origin&quot; could be accredited  to  any one of a number of non-resident countries served, that  the  Imperial Economic Conference adopted the proposal for  a ratio  certificate  from the Government of the country of residence.  A hardly  less powerful consideration to which the Imperial Shipping Committee had drawn attention, was the grave trouble and expense involved for both taxpayer and tax-gatherer which must form a burden upon trade and national  finances   respectively.    This  was  reduced to a minimum by the system of apportionment and certification. The motive expressed by the Imperial Economic Conference in making its  recommendation was:         &quot; For the more convenient ascertaining of the profits     chargeable combined with due security to the Exchequers     concerned.&quot; In the  long run, if not immediately, the Exchequers do not lose by it while the Empire gains in the removal  of a serious and irritating  handicap to overseas transport services.  It is therefore, of the first  importance  that this &quot; working rule,&quot; as the  Conference of 1923  called  it,  should be given a trial in those parts of the Empire which are still taxing  non-resident shipping and doing so on an arbitrary basis. 4.  Ratification of Conventions.     The British Empire should,  and its settled practice is, to honour  its signature  to Conventions which  it has joined in promoting and other nations should be encouraged to adopt this standard of conduct.  The following outstanding Conven- tions have not yet been ratified in all parts of the Empire and wherever this is so call for immediate ratification, e.g.  By the Empire as a whole  Convention on                               Immunity of Public  Ships                              Limitation  of  Shipowners&apos;                                 Liability                              Maritime   Mortgages   and                                 Liens    The  Maritime   Ports Convention,  condemning  FlagDiscrimination has been ratified by all parts of the Empire.
5.  Flag Discrimination.    It will  be remembered  that at the Imperial EconomicConference,  1923, a resolution  on Economic Defence wasadopted in the following terms :         &quot; In  view of  the vital  importance  to  the British    Empire  of  safeguarding  its  overseas  carrying  trade    against  all forms of discrimination by foreign countries,    whether open or disguised,  the representatives of  the    Governments of the Empire declare              &quot; 1.  That in their established practice to make         no  discrimination between the  flags  of  shipping         using their ports, and that they have no intention of         departing from this practice  as  regards countries         which treat ocean-going shipping under the British         flag on a footing of equality with their own national         shipping.             &quot; 2.  That in  the  event of  danger arising in         future to  the  overseas shipping  of  the  Empire         through an attempt by a foreign country to discriminate         against the British  flag, the Governments of  the         Empire  will consult together as to the  best  means         of meeting the  situation.&quot;    Subsequently the  Maritime  Ports  Convention   wasadopted by  the League of  Nations, the chief  provision  ofwhich is as follows :         &quot; Subject to the principle of reciprocity and to the    reservation set  out in the first paragraph of Article 8,    every Contracting  State undertakes to grant the vessels    of every  other  Contracting State, equality of treatment    with its own vessels, or those of any other State whatsci^    ever, in the maritime ports situated under its sovereignty    or authority, as regards freedom of access to the port,    the use  of the port,  and the full enjoyment of the benefits    as regards navigation and commercial operations which    it affords  to vessels, their cargoes and passengers.         &quot; The equality of  treatment thus established shall    cover facilities of all kinds, such as allocation of berths,    loading  and  unloading   facilities,  as well as dues and    charges of all kinds levied in the name or for the account    of the Government, public authorities, concessionaires or    undertakings of  any kind.&quot;    Following the  resolution  and  Convention  referred  to arrangements  have recently been made between Great Britain,Australia and  India on the  one hand and Italy  on the other for  the removal of flag discrimination against British vessels
 in  Italian ports.   It  now  seems necessary to concentrate on securing the withdrawal of  the last vestiges of flag discrimina- tion,  of  which  the most important arise in Portugal.   Even when&apos;- this  has been  done the situation will require  to be watched and it will be desirable for the Empire to continue to show a  united front against any new acts which  threaten the freedom of the seas  in  peace.  To  make the weight of the Empire fully effective for this purpose it is of the first impor- tancq -to maintain  a common standard for &quot;the British ship&quot; in both inter-Empire and international trade. 6.  Consequences  of the.change in status of the Dominions       made at the Imperial Conference 1926, as they relate       to Shipping.   (a) Imperial Merchant Shipping Legislation. &apos;&quot;&apos; The  readjustment of  relations between various parts of the EmPJre  on the basis of equality of.status made by the Imperal Conference in 1926, carried with it the necessity for examining  the  question  of  uniform &apos; shipping legislation throughout  the  Empire.    The Sub-Conference appointed by the Imperial  Conference  1926, to  study this  subject  has recently  met and it is understood that their report which  has not yet  been published, has now been made and is underconsideration  by the  Imperial and Dominion Governments. The examination of this subject by  the  Sub-Conference iswelcomed. ;   It  may be desirable to summarise the conditions and limitations within which uniformity may be attainable.  It is assumed that Great Britain in its relations with other parts of the: Empire will   maintain the   same  full  and  completeauthority as it. possesses in its relations with foreign Statesover-                                       &apos;     . ...     . (i)   Its own ships wherever they may be ;  - r:;&apos;.    !  (ii)  All other ships when within its ports. !-   Since shipping is the  artery  of  imperial marketing and communications upon which she  depends for her  food and raw materials and the  export of her manufactures, and a key industry, neither the Empire nor Great Britain can under any circumstances afford to burden British ships with restrictions which would place  them at  a disadvantage in the open freight market-of the world.   That Great Britain could  contemplate any attempt to maintain her position on any basis of subsidies, discrimination  Or  reserved  trade is  hardly to be thought of. International  standards of  ,safety, etc., can  be  agreed, but since the .science of ship construction and equipment is con-. stantly progressive these must be subject to administrative
 control  exercised  by Great  Britain  in the case of  her own shipping, and it would be  impracticable  to  vest them in an imperial authority.     It is doubtful  whether shipping in any part of the Empire would  desire to lose in any  inter-Empire  or  international trade the status of  &quot; British &quot; ship which would be involved in separate  shipping  legislation  by  the  different parts of  the Empire rendering  their  relations in this matter equivalent to those  between  foreign countries.   Because of the reputation they have  obtained  for  the high standard  maintained this status has a real business value as between  the shipowner and his  customers,  passengers  and cargo owners, as between the shipowner  and his underwriters  and  as between the  cargo owners  and  their  underwriters.   On the  other  hand  an imperial shipping code should involve as a condition precedent the  throwing open of all Empire trades, including Dominion coasting trades, to all vessels flying  the  British flag.  The choice, therefore, appears to be between retaining in general the  present system  or agreeing to adopt  relations  as they exist between foreign  countries as those subsisting between the different parts  of the  Empire in regard to shipping.  In the  face of this choice it is felt that all parts of the Empire will  prefer to retain the present system.  (b) Co-operation with  Shipping in Empire Marketing.     The change of status referred to makes it more than ever desirable  to secure  closer  understanding   and co-operation between British shipping  and Dominion  Governments and commercial and producing  interests in  the  Dominions.  The essential place occupied by British shipping  in the  problem of Empire marketing  has  already been referred to  and active co-operation is necessary  between the parties named above if the  Dominions and  Great Britain are alike  to  secure  efficient and economic sea transport, which they need not only for the prosperity of their own producing industries, but as the  mosttangible link between the different parts of  the Empire.  Tosecure  efficient and  economic sea transport services within theEmpire it is necessary that the Dominions  should encourageand assist          (i)  Efforts by shipowners, producers  and merchants     to  render services  more  efficient  by  cutting out waste    and ensuring an even flow  of  trade  to  fill the ships    required to  handle it, and         (ii) The making  of  a reasonable  return  on  capital    invested in the  ships.    Mutual rationalisation,  so  far from  creating a monopoly,
protects the producing and consuming interests from monopolyconditions which- can only arise when the parties  engaged in trade and  transport are  not in  touch  with  one  another.Efficient  organisation  of shipping  lines does  not  eliminatecompetition  in services but  makes  possible more economies which inure to the benefit of the countries served.     These  principles  were recognised in  Australia  by  theSydney  Conference of  Australian  producers,  importers andexporters and British  shipowners held in April,  1929, when an organisation known as the Australian  Overseas TransportAssociation,  representing  the above  interests  jointly, was created  to  direct a permanent effort at mutual  rationalisation of Australian Overseas  Trade.   This  Conference met at the invitation of the late Federal Government, but it  was entirely divorced from politics and the need in the interests of Australia for giving full and early effect to  its recommendations remains whatever Government may be in power.      This  effort to secure for  Australia the  full  benefit of Overseas  transport in  the  marketing of her produce may commend  itself to  other parts  of  the  Empire.  In  South Africa a Shipping Board has indeed  been established, but it is handicapped  by the fact  that it is  a  government concern controlling essentially business problems, and its success must largely depend upon  its ability to secure the co-operation of shipowners who are not now represented on it.

          LONDON:WOMEN&apos;S PRINTING SOCIETY, LTD., BRICK STREET, PICCADILLY, W. I.
                               [Enclosure No. 2 to Appendix A.]                    NOTE  ON DOUBLE  TAXATION  OF SHIPPING.    It is not suggested by the Chamber of Shipping that the general question of reciprocal arrangementsfor the avoidance of double taxation in respect of shipping profits should be brought up at the Conferenceand, indeed, any discussion on this subject would be quite fruitless.  What is suggested is that thequestion of the universal adoption of the method of assessment, which was unanimously recommendedby the Imperial Conference in 1923, should be raised. It is understood that the only Dominion whichhas not  adopted this method is Australia.    It will be remembered that the position at the time of the Imperial Conference of  1926 was that two Dominions, viz., Australia and South Africa, had not adopted the method in question, and it wasdecided  that it would be better to raise the question outside the Conference with the representativesof these two Dominions.  This was done with success in the case of South Africa, and there were grounds for hoping that Australia would also fall into line,  but it appears that  this hope has notmaterialised.  The case for dealing with the matter direct with the representatives of Australia seemseven stronger to-day that it was in 1926.   It is suggested that the Australian Government should beinformed in  advance that advantage will be taken of  the  opportunity  afforded by the  ImperialConference to discuss this matter with their representatives.                                     APPENDIX  B.          PROPOSALS MADE  BY NATIONAL UNION  OF  MANUFACTURERS.    1.  There are attached a copy of the representations submitted by the Union in April and a copyof a letter sent to the Prime Minister on 16th July, submitting additional points.   (Enclosures Nos. 1and 2.)    2.  The major part of the representations made in April are concerned with the development ofthe resources of the Empire.  It is suggested that a survey be made of all these resources with a viewto pooling them and concentrating production in those places most economically suited for the purpose.To draw up such a scheme and to propose the necessary measures (e.g., tariffs) to carry it out, it issuggested that &quot; representatives &quot; of all parts of the Empire be summoned to the meetings that wouldbe necessary.  It  is suggested that such meetings be initiated by the various Governments and thatthe question should be considered at the Imperial Conference.  A permanent body might later be setup to watch the development  of the measures recommended in the survey.    3.  Other proposals made  by the Union are            (a) A scheme for levying Customs duties, on goods exported to  Empire  countries  prior      to shipment.  This scheme has been examined and is considered to be impracticable.           (b) Standardisation of the qualification for preferential duties on exports to the Dominions.      The desirability of raising this question was considered by the Board of Trade and it was thought      that it would  be undesirable to raise it at the  Conference, since it is only in Canada that      the present  conditions  are irksome.   The matter has been under discussion with Canada for      some time.           (c) Lower postal rates, particularly for parcels.  This matter is already under consideration      by the General Post  Office and it is possible that it will be discussed at the Conference.           (d) Operation of tariff increases.  It is suggested that tariff increases should not apply      to goods actually shipped or in transit at the time the increase in tariff is announced.   The      same point is raised in  a resolution of  the Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the British      Empire and the Board  of Trade are in communication with the Treasury on the subject,  since      that Department has not hitherto felt able to agree to the principle involved, so far as concerns      its application to this country.                              [Enclosure No.  1  to Appendix B.]REPRESENTATIONS  FORWARDED BY THE NATIONAL UNION  OF manufacturers to THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE  ON 9TH APRIL,  1930, WITH  A VIEW          TO  THEIR  CONSIDERATION BY  THE  IMPERIAL  CONFERENCE.      (1) Imperial Customs Union.          (2) Levying of Customs Duties prior to Shipment.      (3) Qualification for Imperial Preference Didies.      (4) Empire Postal Arrangements,                                 Imperial  Economic Relations.    The National Union of Manufacturers desires- to urge the desirability of a thorough investigation into the economic relations between Great Britain  and the Dominions and Colonies and the necessityfor taking every reasonable means to stimulate trade between the component parts  of the Empire.
    The importance of the Dominion and Colonial markets to Great Britain and of the British market to our overseas Empire is self-evident.   In 1929 we received 26 per cent, of our imports from, and sent 41 per cent, of our exports to, overseas Empire countries as against 29 per cent, and 43 per cent.in 1925 and 27 per cent, and 48 per cent, in 1926, while the inter-Imperial Trade is somewhere  in theneighbourhood of 40 per cent, of the whole of the Empire trade, the proportion having gone down from42 per cent, in 1926 to 39 per cent, in 1927 (figures are not available for later years).    From this it would appear that Great Britain&apos;s proportion of Empire trade is decreasing and thatthe Empire is tending to do more of its trade with foreign countries, and our representations will bedirected in the main to the methods by which these tendencies may be checked, and inter-empire trade increased and consolidated to the mutual advantage of this country and of our overseas Dominionsand Colonies.    For the Dominions and Colonies, and still more for this country, an expanding export market isessential, and the N.U.M., while not desiring to belittle the importance of trade with foreign countries,is definitely of the opinion that the territories of the Empire, in which they have natural as well asactual fiscal preferences, offer to its component parts the production of which  is largely comple-mentary a more promising field than foreign  countries for the development  of a profitable exporttrade.    As far as Great Britain is concerned, it must be admitted that our export trade is not increasingas fast as the export trade of our competitors, and the two most,important factors militating against us in obtaining our fair proportion of the world&apos;s trade are : -           (1) The  competition from countries where the gold value of wages and the standard of       living are lower than our own, and where taxation per head of population is lower than in this       country.           (2) The increasing  power of competition in world markets of the U.S.A.    In the case of the former countries, the policy of inflation of currency, which so many of them havepursued, has caused the external and internal values of their currencies to differ to such an extent asto give them an undue advantage over us in their costs of production, while their taxation is verymuch lower than ours the latest figures per head of population being: Great  Britain,  15 Is. 5d.;Germany,   7 9s. 5d. (or  9 12s. 8d. if State Taxes are included) ; France,  1 7s. Od. ; Italy,  4 4s. Od.;or if the estimated percentage of taxation to income is taken as the basis of comparison 22 per cent.in Great Britain as against 20-1 per  cent, in Germany, 18-2 per cent, in Italy, and 17-1 per cent, inFrance ;  and Germany, Italy and France have also the advantage of protected home markets  andcheaper wages.  Largely owing to these circumstances our  foreign competitors are in a position toland various classes of goods in this  country and the Dominions at a lower cost than is possible forBritish manufacturers.    In the United  States, on the  other hand,  we have a country consisting of a number of  Statesbetween which, although they have separate administrations, there is a free and unfettered exchangeof commodities, protected from outside competition by a tariff which goes a long way to exclude goods of foreign manufacture, and also with  the  advantage of much lower taxation than ours  ( 5 13s. 6d.per head or  8 14s. 3d.  if State Taxes are included as against  15 Is.  5d. in Great Britain, whileit is estimated that in the U.S.A. only 10-6 per cent, of income is taken in taxation as against 22 percent,  in Great Britain).   In their secured position U.S.A. manufacturers are  able  to form a.,fairlyreliable estimate of the requirements of their  home market on which to base their manufacturingprogrammes, and they can therefore organise their industries in such  a way as  to maintain a fairlyeven  continuity of output reasonably near their maximum.  This continuity of output is one  of themost  important factors in modern production, because in the present development  of specialisedmachinery a high degree of organisation, which is  dependent on a steady  flow of output, is  essential for production at competitive prices.  The security of their home market enables the U.S.A. manu-facturers,  scrapping ruthlessly machinery which has become obsolete, to rationalise their productionpromptly  and thoroughly, and to organise their output on continuous lines, in this way keeping their cost of production per unit at the lowest level without reducing their existing high wages.  It  alsoplaces them in a position  to standardise and simplify their production by mutual  agreement so thatthey  are less subject to the difficulties under which we labour of having a variety of new  patternsconstantly coming on their market.    In modern methods of manufacture the actual cost of the direct labour in making the goods is lowin comparison with ancillary  costs of production  (skilled labour for tool-making and other similarcharges), and if productionisnot kept up, the cost of this ancillary labour forms a constantly increasingpercentage of the total expenditure, and conversely, if production is increased the percentage falls.The manufacturers in the U.S.A.,  therefore, endeavour to maintain the highest possible production,and if they have any surplus on the home market requirements over which the ancillary charges havebeen spread, they are in a position to dispose of it  at a price below the current home level and so are able to sell large classes of goods  abroad at lower average  prices  than those  at which they can beobtained elsewhere.  As other countries have realised this and  protected their markets by means ofa tariff, ours is the  principal market  to which they can send these surplus goods.  But if our U.S.A.competitors were open in  their home market to competition similar to that to which we are exposedin ours, they would not be able to absorb in the same degree their ancillary costs over the home marketconsumption, with the effect that.they would not be able to offer their surplus production at such low prices.    It having become necessary for the U.S.A. to do an increasing export trade, they are making special efforts to obtain a larger share of the world markets and particularly those supplied by Great Britain.    The increasing competition from the U.S.A. has recently led to an entirely novel proposal, viz.,the formation of a European Customs Union, consisting of all the principal manufacturing countriesin Europe.   Should such a Customs Union in Europe materialise,  it would naturally restrict theimports of manufactured articles from outside into European countries, and we should be faced with
the alternative of entering the Union and placing tariffs on imports from our Dominions and Colonies,or of forming within our own Empire which has a population of 450 millions as against 200 millions in the suggested European Customs  Union and 120 millions in the U.S.A. a Customs Union whichwould impose on goods imported from its constituent areas reciprocal duties at lower rates than thosewhich would be imposed on similar articles imported from foreign  countries.    In view of the ties which unite us to our Dominions and Colonies,  and even apart from theircomparatively large consumption of  our manufactures  ( 14 11s. Id. per head  of population in new Zealand,   8 10s. 2d. in Australia,  4 3s. Sd. in South Africa, and  3 12s. 6d. in Canada, as against15s. 5d. in France, 11s. 6d. in Germany, 7s. Wd. in  Italy, and 7s. Gd.  in the U.S.A., 1929 figures),the N.U.M. is opposed to our  entering a European Customs Union,  and if this view is accepted itseems obligatory to set up some system for the British Empire similar  to that which has proved sosuccessful for the  U.S.A.    This brings us to the consideration of other factors that have a bearing on the question.  Duringthe last 50 years  the productivity of the  manufacturing world has increased continuously and in avery large ratio, but the spending capacity of the world&apos;s population which until recently kept pace with it, is now showing signs of slowing down.  Additional spending capacity is essential if prosperityis to be restored,  and as this additional spending capacity can only arise from increased production(real wealth consisting of commodities produced) a  well thought-out scheme for stimulating Empireproduction should be formulated.    The Dominions are anxious, and quite reasonably, to develop industries for which they considerthey are suited, and we welcome these developments which tend to increase their spending power andtherefore their capacity for absorbing our manufactures,  but it is desirable from our point of viewthat such increased spending power should be directed,  as  far as may be practicable having regardto their own interests, towards the purchase of British products. We can, however, if we are preparedto facilitate the sale of their products in  our markets, very reasonably ask them (as the  economic mission to Australia suggested)  not to protect secondary industries which are economically unsoundand the volume of which in their countries is not likely in any reasonable period of time to be sufficientto enable satisfactory economic units of manufacture to be set up. -    In these circumstances, as a preliminary measure we ask for a survey to be made of the mineral,agricultural, manufacturing, etc., resources of the Empire, with a view to pooling these resources andconcentrating  production in economic units in those places best suited to profitable  production andcheap distribution.  For this purpose we suggest that representatives should be summoned from all parts of the Empire to draw up  in consultation a scheme for the development of the natural resourcesof the Empire including the transportation of its products, for the encouragement of migration fromits more crowded  to its thinly populated parts, and  at the same time to prepare a considered schemeof tariffs suitable for each part of the Empire, with a view to securing the success of the development scheme  and the maintenance of the important industries at  present in existence, and  also  thosewhich will be initiated under the scheme.    In more detail the principal duties to  be undertaken by this body would include :            (1) A survey of all the mineral and other resources  of the Empire with a scheme for their      gradual development.           (2) The development of a  plan showing the additions which will be necessary to the present      means of Empire communication in order to  secure the most economical methods of handling      the present production.           (3) The preparation of an estimate of the number of  inhabitants which  each  Colony or      Dominion might be expected to maintain in the future  on a reasonable standard of life, together      with  a  scheme for providing any  additional white population which may  be required as      development progresses from British sources.           (4) The compilation  of a schedule of the primary products which it is recommended should      be produced or manufactured  in each area.           In  respect of such primary products, it  would be  within the discretion of each area to      impose  customs duties to whatever extent it might consider justified  on competitive products,      but the body referred to (or any other body which might be set up to carry on its work after      the completion of the preliminary surveys) should have power to make representations to the      Governments concerned.   Products not considered to be primary products might be exchanged      between all parts of the  Empire, either duty free or at  such rates of duty as might be jointly      determined on.           (5) The working out of a schedule of duties to be imposed on goods not of Empire origin      imported into any part of the Empire, these duties to be in  excess of those applied to goods      of Empire origin.    It is suggested that the Imperial Economic Conference should take into consideration the settingup, after the preliminary surveys have been completed, of a permanent body representative of GreatBritain, the Dominions, India and the  Colonies, to watch the development of the measures recommended in the surveys, and to put forward from time to time in consultation with the various Governmentssuch proposals&apos; as  may be necessary for strengthening Empire commerce and industry.    We are aware that these proposals may clash with views which have been reckoned authoritativein the past, but we very earnestly plead for their free and unfettered consideration by the ImperialConference, for it is the economic life of Great Britain  and the Empire which is at stake.   Recent eventshave strengthened the desire of the Dominions for closer ties with Great Britain,  and the feeling of protest  to which  the progressive increases in the United States import duties have given rise inCanada and Australia have undoubtedly  intensified their desire for closer trade relations with thiscountry.   This opportunity, if not taken advantage  of, may be difficult to recapture in the future.(C1234)D
    The Administrative Committee of the National Union of Manufacturers therefore  desires toemphasise the need for systematic consultation between representatives of industry and trade in thevarious parts of the Empire, both in connection with the Imperial Conference and in the intervalsbetween its meetings, so that due weight may be given to the interests of every part of the Empirebefore decisions are come to on industrial and trade questions affecting them in common.    Any scheme for such consultation is likely to be more authoritative and more generally acceptedif initiated by the Empire Governments as a whole, and it is hoped that this question may receive due consideration at the Imperial Conference.      Scheme for Levying Customs  Duties prior- to Shipment of Goods exported to Empire Countries.    It is recommended that steps  Should be taken to devise arrangements under which customs chargesmay be assessed and paid before  shipment on goods consigned from any one part to any other partof the Empire so that delivery can be made at their destinations without hindrance of any kind.    If such a system was adopted  it would be possible for a British manufacturer shipping, for instance,to Canada, to apply to Canada House to have the goods inspected in his factory by a Canadian officialwho would collect the duty and seal the packing cases, so that the goods would be free to enter Canadaduty paid without further trouble.  The manufacturers would be prepared to pay a fee, say, of  1 percent,  or even 2 per cent, of the duty, for services rendered, and in this way the system would be self-supporting.   Such a system would be particularly advantageous to the smaller manufacturers whoare not in a position to establish warehouses in various parts of the Empire and would enable them to quote a price, delivered free, to their customers&apos; place of business.    Any risk of goods getting through to a Dominion or Colony without paying duty could be guarded against by placing an official mark on the cases and by a comparison of weights and signatures on thebill of lading.    So far as Great Britain is concerned, the Dominions already have Customs representatives situatedhere who make enquiries regarding the accuracy of the declarations in support of claims for preferential rates  of duty,  and it is felt  that with comparatively little disturbance the scheme outlined abovecould be successfully operated without any additional cost to the countries concerned, in  which case it would undoubtedly lead to an expansion of trade within the Empire.        Standardisation of Qualification for Preferential Duty on Exports to the Dominions.    It is considered that the varying qualifications now in operation for preferential duties on Britishproducts are in need of standardisation.    The principal regulations at present in force are set out  below.   . South Africa. Goods must contain 25 per cent, or more of British labour.    New Zealand. Final process must be performed in Great Britain and expenditure in  materialproduced in Great Britain or labour performed in Great Britain is not less than  50 per cent, of thefactory or works cost of the article in its finished state.    Australia. Final process must be performed in Great Britain.    For goods of a kind produced in Australia, expenditure in United Kingdom labour and for materialmust be not less than 75 per cent, of factory or works cost of finished article.    For goods of  a kind not commercially produced in Australia the percentage must be  not lessthan  25.    In the case of Australia it is  apparently not possible to  claim the preference in respect of articleswholly manufactured in this country from raw materials imported from other Dominions.    Canada. The article must be finished by a substantial amount of labour in the United Kingdomand each article must have been produced to an extent of not less than 50 per cent, (reckoned on costof production)  through the industry of one or more British countries.    It is considered that a thorough  review of the conditions now imposed should be carried outwith  a view to securing standardised conditions to the fullest extent practicable.                                      Postal Arrangements.    The National Union of Manufacturers is of opinion that the postal arrangements between thevarious parts of the Empire should be examined by a representative Conference, at which industrial and commercial, as well as departmental, interests should be represented.     The aim of the Conference should be to facilitate and where feasible to reduce  the cost of postal communications and the conveyance of parcels between Empire countries.     The anomalies at  present existing  are considerable.  For example, New Zealand and Canadahave  penny postage to all  parts of  the  Empire, and it is considered that these rates should bereciprocated and as far as possible extended to other Empire countries.     The cost of despatching parcels from this country to the Dominions is in some cases higher thansimilar charges from Germany and other foreign countries, e.g., the English  parcel rate  for 5kg. toAustralia is 6s. Ad., whereas the German rate for the same weight is 5s. 3$d., and the French rate5s. 2d. ; in the case of Canada there is even a greater difference, the English rate for 5kg. being 6s. 5d.,Germany 3s. Id.,  and France 3s. 2d. ;  to  South Africa the English rate is 6s. 3d., and the  Germanrate 5s. 3\d. ; to India the English rate is 5s. 3d. as against 3s. Sd. for Germany and 3s. 3d.  for France.

Government.                                1. Operation of  Tariff Increases.    It is very desirable to limit as far as possible the immediate disturbances to trade resulting fromthe numerous changes which are now being made  in tariff schedules in the Dominions as well as inforeign countries.    The Administrative Committee realise that to be effective and in order to avoid evasion, increases in tariff rates must generally speaking be made applicable as soon as they are announced, but it isconsidered that goods actually shipped or in transit at the time the increase is announced should beadmitted at the rate of duty in force at the time of shipment.  The  acceptance of this proposal by theDominions and this country would be of advantage to exporters of Empire goods, whilst the loss ofrevenue involved would be negligible.                2. Imperial Parcels Post Service.  Preferential Inter-Empire  Rates.    My Committee desire to urge that a scheme for  the preferential treatment of inter-Imperial parcelsshould be brought into operation with a view to encouraging the extension and development of tradewithin the Empire.    The Post Office receives parcels for conveyance throughout the Empire  up to  34 ft. in length,breadth or depth, and 6 ft.  in length and girth combined.  These measurements are subject to the weight of the parcel not exceeding 22 lb. except in the case of Australia, the Union of South Africa,and Egypt, where the maximum weight is only 11  lb.  While there may be difficulties in the way ofincreasing the maximum dimensions, it should be  practicable  to extend  the limits of weight and ifthis could be done it would materially assist the export of a number of  commodities for which thepresent maximum weight is  unsuitable.    The existing rates for conveyance are made up by            (a) uniform charges for handling and land conveyance  in the countries of despatch and      destination; and           (b) the actual ocean freight charges, and cost of conveyance through intermediate countries,      if any.    My Committee have not been able to get particulars of the charges apportioned in each Empirecountry for the cost of land conveyance and local delivery, but if, as we think likely, this cost accounts for the greater part of the charge under (a) above, it should be possible for a lower figure to  be set down for it, when dealing with packages received from an Empire country, and thus enable a total preferentialrate to be quoted for all parcels from one Empire area to another.    We further desire to submit for the favourable consideration of H.M. Government and the ImperialConference, the question of establishing a uniform rate throughout the Empire for all packages withindefined limits of measurement and weight  in approximation to the  mail letter service, the advantageof which in our view would more than compensate  for any loss of revenue which it would entail.    The question of Imperial parcels post rates is of special interest to the United Kingdom, in presentcircumstances, in view of the increasing trade which is being done direct with settlers in distant partsof overseas countries and which trade is being actively sought by American and Continental firms.                                                  I am, etc.,                                                         (Signed)   J. A. CORCORAN,                                                                                 Director.    The Rt.

APPENDIX C.      NOTE COVERING  THE  REPORT ISSUED BY  TRADES  UNION CONGRESS                                   GENERAL  COUNCIL.    1. The memorandum issued by the Economic Committee of the Trades Union Congress general council discusses the questions of the formation of international economic groups and the ImperialConference.    2. The Committee explain that by the term &quot; economic  group &quot;  is meant a group of nationsmaintaining balance between supplies of raw materials and foodstuffs, and observing free trade withinthe group, but protection against outsiders, if necessary. They dismiss the alternatives to the formationof economic groups (viz., isolation and world economic unity) as impracticable, and proceed to examinethe relative advantages of            (a) a European bloc ;           (b) an Anglo-United States bloc ;           (c) a British Commonwealth bloc.    3. The Committee come to the conclusion that there is little use in pursuing (a) and (6) in viewof the clash of economic interests (&quot; all are, or soon will be, predominantly manufacturing countries &quot;)and the fact  that the U.S.A. shows no enthusiasm for such action, and claims that if the policy ofeconomic blocs is pursued by the nations, the most practicable group for the United Kingdom wouldappear to be the consolidation of the British Commonwealth.  The principal arguments advanced insupport of this contention are            (a) that a bloc already exists ;           (6) ties of sentiment;          (c) supplies of raw materials  and manufactured goods could be balanced ;          (d) existing preferences and commercial discriminations.    4. The Committee consider that action on these lines would not detrimentally affect our relationswith the League of Nations or with the International Labour movement.    5. Dealing with the Imperial Conference, the Committee  consider that it would be in the interestsof our own people and of the Dominions to press for as full a development as possible of the economic relations between the constituent parts of  the British Commonwealth, at the same time avoiding any suggestion of antagonism either to European aims or U.S.A.  policy.    6. The memorandum concludes :           &quot;As a first step it is suggested that regular Economic Conferences should be held, every      three or four years, at which representatives  of Britain and the Dominions and Colonies could      discuss and consult upon the economic affairs of the Commonwealth.   The delegates would be      appointed by the Governments on  somewhat the same lines that were adopted in the case      of the World Economic Conference, 1927.   They would consist of the Government officials      concerned with economic and trade questions, representatives of industry, both employers and      employed ; and representatives of commerce, finance, shipping and agriculture. The Conferences      would observe continuity, and their function would be to evolve an economic policy for the      British Commonwealth, independently of party politics.  An Inter-Commonwealth Economic      Secretariat would be created, on somewhat similar lines to the Economic Organisation of the      League.  Its function would be  to  investigate economic questions and problems affecting the      Commonwealth.  It would consist of economic and technical experts appointed by the various      Governments and paid out of a common fund.   The Secretariat  would also have the function      of  arranging the agenda of the  Economic  Conferences, and would  be brought into proper      relations with the existing Imperial Economic Committee.   Such steps would pave the way for      the establishment of the closest economic relations between the constituent parts of the British      Commonwealth, to the mutual advantage of  all the peoples concerned.&quot;    Appended to the above memorandum there is a later document which was issued in amplificationof the memorandum.  This appendix states that when  compiling the memorandum the Committeewere not influenced  either by the question of  tariffs, or by the propaganda for so-called EmpireFree Trade.    The Appendix emphasises that the question of developing closer economic links with other nationsmay be discussed without special reference to tariffs, and concludes that &quot; we should be well advised todevelop as far as possible such economic relations between the constituent parts of the British Common-wealth as will be to our mutual advantage.&quot;

TRADES  UNION CONGRESS  GENERAL COUNCIL.                                 ECONOMIC COMMITTEE.                     IMPERIAL CONFERENCE :  ECONOMIC GROUPS.     1. In view of the forthcoming Imperial Conference and of the discussions that have been takingplace on the Continent and in this country regarding a United States of Europe,  the matter has beenconsidered by the Economic Committee and the following conclusions have been reached.   It has beensuggested that the proposals for Economic Groups, whether European or British Commonwealth, arenot in any way antagonistic to  each other; it is thought by many people that we could enter into a united States of Europe, pursue the policy of a Commonwealth Economic Group, and perhaps eventhe policy of an Anglo-American Alliance at the same time.  Such a view does not seem to take accountof the actual proposals that have been made, for instance, by M. Briand, but rather has in mind a vagueaspiration towards further international understandings on  economic matters.    2. If, by Economic Groups,  we mean simply groups of nations which conclude ordinary commercial treaties or which hold international conferences, then it is true that the various projects are not mutuallyantagonistic ; we can certainly  pursue a policy of economic friendship and, to a certain extent, co-operation with the rest of Europe, with the Dominions and with America at the same time.  Probably,this is all that is meant by those who think we should pursue all these objectives  simultaneously.    3. This is not quite what is  meant, however, by those politicians and economists who are actuallyadvocating definite Economic Groups ; their  conception usually is that  a group of nations might allythemselves, maintaining as far as possible balance between supplies of  raw materials  and foodstuffson the one hand, and manufactured goods on the other ; observing Free Trade within the Group, butprotection against outsiders, if necessary; and, in short, forming a group as self-contained as possible but (since it is impossible to be completely self-contained), sufficiently strong in the economic sense to exchange products with other groups on fair terms.    4. It will be clear that if anything in the nature of tariff barriers is contemplated, we cannot pursuethese different policies simultaneously.  We can scarcely be  part of a United States of Europe whichhas a tariff wall round it, and at the same time be part of a British Commonwealth Group, which hasalso a tariff against those not in  the Group.    Then there is the question of raw materials.  If we are in a Commonwealth Group we shall try toensure for every member of the Group an adequate supply of essential raw materials.  In the caseof certain  products of which there is a scarcity, this may involve to some extent  a monopoly of such products for our own Group.  On the  other hand, if we are  members of a European Group, we shallhave to advocate the &quot; open door &quot; policy as far as raw materials are concerned, since Europe lackssupplies of some of these essential commodities.    Similarly, as regards markets ; as members of a European Group, we should normally be competingagainst  each other,  since the  leading European nations  make,  practically  speaking,  the  samemanufactured goods.  We should therefore have to try to make some bargain with other parts of theworld regarding markets, while at the same time we should have to come to some European agreement as to production quotas or for  the allocation of  world markets.   As members of a CommonwealthGroup, on the other hand, we should probably wish to make the most favourable arrangements withinthe Group for exchanging our own products with each other.    If the conception of an Anglo-American Group  is introduced, the matter becomes still more com-plicated. A European Group might wish to exclude American products unless America made it possiblefor European products to be introduced into the United States of America.    It will therefore be clear that, apart from vague aspirations, the concrete economic policies thatwould have to be followed would make it impossible for Britain to be a member  of more than one ofthese groups at the same time.    5. The alternatives to such  grouping appear at the moment to be impracticable.  One alternative is for this country to maintain a position of isolation, making the best bargain possible with anyoneand everyone.  That is our traditional policy, but is it possible to maintain it any longer ? It has  tobe remembered that other groups are actually coming into existence, and, this being so, has a policyof isolation any chance of succeeding in future ?    The second alternative is that of world economic unity.  This, of course, is what we should desireas being in line with the whole  of our policy ; unfortunately, it cannot be regarded as practicable  atthe present time.  Few, if any, of the leading powers are prepared for a complete international economicagreement, covering markets, raw materials, etc.    It may be  true that the sheer logic  of  events is driving the nations towards a  comprehensiveinternational agreement, but, if the events of recent years are any indication, this  will take a very long time to accomplish. It would, indeed, seem that the formation of more limited groups is a necessarystep towards the more comprehensive unity.(C1234)D3
    6.  The pros and cons of the definite groups that have been suggested may be given briefly asfollows :            European Bloc. The factors in favour of a European bloc are that the countries of Western      Europe are closely allied geographically ;  that they share a common plight due to the war, and      a  common apprehension of America&apos;s economic power ; and that they would probably be      powerful enough to ensure the peace of the world.  Further, the experience of the League of      Nations and other international  bodies  encourages the hope  that, when once the bloc was      formed, the creation of  machinery for international adjudication and  administration would      inevitably follow,  and that this would in time evolve into an organ of genuine international      government.           The factors against are the racial and language difficulties ;  the fact that all  are, or soon will      be, predominantly manufacturing countries, and therefore very far from being  self-contained ;      and  that,  largely because of this fact, their economic interests tend to clash rather than coincide.      This last consideration is a very strong one.  It is difficult to believe that the nations of Western      Europe would continue long in agreement, in the absence of a world  settlement,  especially      in view of the nationalistic aims and policies of many of these countries.           British Commonwealth. The  factors in favour are that the bloc already exists in a tentative      kind of way ;  that there are, undoubtedly, ties of sentiment that count still in the economic      sphere ;  that supplies of raw materials and of manufactured goods could be balanced,  the      group being rich in raw materials and, in fact, almost self-contained ; that there is to a large      extent a common language; and that there is abundant opportunity for movements of population      within the group.           It  has further to be remembered that there is already to some extent a tariff bond within      the  Commonwealth, in the form of preferences and other commercial discriminations, applying      to both the Dominions and the Colonies.           The factors often urged against are the geographical separation between the different parts      of the Group, a defect which is now much  less serious owing  to the great development in      communications and transport, and the  burden  of defence in view of the scattered nature of      the Group and the economic position of some of the component parts.           Anglo-American Bloc. This grouping would presumably include the British Commonwealth      and would be in effect an English-speaking bloc.  The factors in favour are that such a Group      would be  self-contained, and would be quite powerful enough to ensure the peace of the world ;      and that  there is to a large extent a common language and race.           The factors against are that  at present their economic interests tend to clash rather than      coincide ; that the distance separating them makes a common  policy difficult; and that, to      many Americans, at  any rate,  U.S.A.  can manage quite well without any such alliance.      American ideas, in fact,  run rather to the Pan-American Union  (which already exists, though      some of the South American and Central American States are  by no  means  in love with it,      owing to  their fear of U.S.A. domination), and Americans ask what incentive there is for them      to join with Britain and what gain it would be to them.     7. If the policy of forming economic blocs is pursued by the nations, the most practicable group from our point of view would appear to be consolidation of the British Commonwealth.   The formation of blocs would not necessarily be a real solution of international economic problems, as the result might merely be intensified competition between different groups, although, on the other hand, it might mean the elimination of most of the economic causes of conflict.     Meanwhile,  it is quite a practicable policy to press simultaneously for the development of the British Commonwealth as a group of free nations, and for the extension of the League of Nations  and the development of its scope and influence.  It is only where exclusive economic agreements of any kind are involved that adhesion to more than  one bloc becomes impossible, and in such cases it would appear to be most practicable and most to the  interest of our own people and  of the Dominions to maintain the economic unity of the British Commonwealth.  At the same time such a policy would not in  any way  affect detrimentally our support, and participation in the work, of the League  of Nations,  but rather to the  contrary;  we should be in a better position  to strengthen the scope and authority of the League.   Similarly this policy would not in the least affect detrimentally our relations with the I.F.T.U. or the International Labour movement generally, but would strengthen us inside these move- ments.   Naturally, we should not be prevented by  this policy from concluding European or other international agreements regarding the marketing of coal, steel or other commodities  ; the difference would be that we should bargain as a Commonwealth Group instead of  as Great Britain, and in many cases this would be a decided advantage.     8. As far as the Imperial Conference is concerned, therefore, it would be in the interests of our own people and of the Dominions to press for as full a development as possible of the economic relations between the constituent parts of the British Commonwealth.  At the same time, it is vitally necessary to avoid any suggestion of antagonism, either to European aims or American policy.  The maintenance of close relations with the rest of the world does not prevent us from urging the creation of machinery and, if necessary, formal  agreements with the Dominions for the further development of inter-Common- wealth trade and for the best possible distribution of economic activities within the British Common- wealth.  It is hardly necessary to say that the policy suggested would not involve the surrender, by any Dominion, of any advantage or favourable situation it now enjoys.  There is no thought of asking the Dominions to give up anything.   Whatever economic arrangements were made would be to their advantage as  much as to ours ;  that would be the very basis of negotiations.

APPENDIX TO MEMORANDUM ON  IMPERIAL CONFERENCE :                                   ECONOMIC  GROUPS.    1. The purpose of this Appendix is to amplify, in accordance with the General CounciFs decisionof 28th May, the Memorandum on the above subject circulated previously to the Council and discussed on that date.   It has been thought best to leave the Memorandum in its original brief form, giving the explanations, and the general considerations on which the conclusions were based, in this separate note.    2. In the first place, the question of tariffs was  not in any way raised in the Memorandum, andit has not even been considered by the Economic Committee. The propaganda for so-called &quot; EmpireFree Trade &quot;  has neither occasioned nor influenced the discussions of the  Committee.    3. The Committee&apos;s discussions originated in a survey  of the world economic situation, viewedespecially in the light of the following recent events : -           (a) the consideration by the Economic Consultative Committee  of the League of Nations      of the Economic Factors affecting the Peace of the World ;           (b) the  adoption by the  Executive Committee  of the  I.F.T.U.  for submission to  the      Stockholm Congress, of an International Economic Programme (given in the T.U.C. Annual      Report for 1929, page 264);           (c) the  propaganda on  the Continent for a United  States  of Europe, culminating in      M. Briand&apos;s scheme, given in the Press on 19th May last;           (d) the holding of an Imperial Conference in September next, when economic questions will      be discussed at  special sessions; and the discussions between the  General  Council and  the      F.B.I.  on this matter.    4. As regards the first of these, a Memorandum was prepared, as long ago as April,  1929, whichembodied most of the foregoing Memorandum on Economic  Groups.   It discussed also the extensionof international trusts and cartels, and the growth of the economic activities of the League of Nations,all in relation to the economic causes of wars.  The subject is still under consideration by the economic organisation  of the League, and the formation of close economic bonds between particular nations isclearly a very important factor that has to be taken into account in discussions of the problem, whetherthose  bonds take the form of tariff agreements or  other arrangements having  nothing to do withtariffs.    5. The Economic Programme of the I.F.T.U. will be discussed at Stockholm.  The draft acceptedby the Executive Committee contains recommendations for the development of the economic activitiesof the League ; the supervision of international trusts and cartels  ; and the abolition of tariff and customs  barriers and other restrictions on  trade, on  the lines laid down  by the World EconomicConference in 1927.  In this connection, also, it will be clear that the formation of special economicbonds between nations, whether groups are formally constituted or not, is an important factor.(C1234)D4    9. As a first step it is suggested that regular Economic Conferences should be held, every three orfour years, at which representatives of Britain and the Dominions and Colonies could discuss and consult upon the economic affairs of the Commonwealth.   The delegates would be appointed by theGovernments on somewhat the same lines that  were adopted in the case  of the World EconomicConference, 1927.  They would consist of the Government officials concerned with economic and trade questions ;   representatives of industry,  both employers and  employed;   and  representatives  ofcommerce, finance,  shipping and agriculture.   The Conferences would observe continuity, and theirfunction would be to evolve an economic policy for the British Commonwealth, independently of party politics.  An Inter-Commonwealth  Economic Secretariat would  be created on somewhat  similar lines to the  Economic  Organisation of the  League.  Its function  would be to investigate economic questions and problems affecting the  Commonwealth.  It would  consist of economic and  technical experts appointed  by the various Governments and paid out of a common fund.  The Secretariatwould also have the function of arranging the agenda of the Economic Conferences, and would be broughtinto proper relations with the existing Imperial Economic Committee.  Such steps would pave the way for the establishment of the closest economic relations  between  the constituent parts of the BritishCommonwealth,  to the mutual advantage of all the peoples concerned.Copied.  HT/917.    26th June, 1930.
    6. While the growth of international trusts and cartels and the development of the economic workof the League are of the utmost importance, the establishment of other special economic bonds between nations has been forced into the limelight by reason of the Briand proposals (which have been known tobe in preparation for some time), by a renewed interest in the  foreign operations of American capital,and by the highly important discussions that will take place  when the Imperial Conference meets inSeptember.   On this last point it has to be remembered that the entire constitutional structure of theBritish Commonwealth is still in the melting pot.  The revolution in the status of the Dominions thatwas formally recognised by the decisions of the last Imperial Conference in  1926 has been proceedingsince in various ways, and the decisions of the forthcoming Conference will be vital to the future of theCommonwealth.    7. It may be  objected that the question of forming &quot; economic groups &quot; of nations is a purelyacademic one, and that, therefore, the pros and cons of the different possibilities need not be considered.Those who think along this line take the view that economic relationships are really world-wide, everynation having economic ties with a multitude of other nations,  just as the circumstances of the momentdictate.  As long as nations act  as individual units, it is thought, we  need  not consider the questionof groups ; let the only movement linking individual nations organically be the League, which aimsat a world-wide &quot; federation.&quot;  World-wide federation is, indeed, the goal of the Trade Union andLabour movements, and if it were true that the League represented to-day the only grouping of nations,and that all other economic bonds were haphazard, between  individual nations alone, nothing moreneed be  said.  We  should then be acting most wisely if we continued to make arrangements as an individual country, forming this link with one nation and that with another, just as seemed best at themoment, while pressing  all the time for the world-wide union through the League.    8. We must not, however, be blind to existing facts and tendencies.  In the first place the growth in the authority and effective power of the League will be very slow.  That is sufficiently shown by thefailure of the nations generally  to take even the cautious steps towards freer intercourse  that were unanimously agreed upon by the World Economic  Conference,  1927.   Mr.  Graham&apos;s more recentfailure to get even a tariff truce is a further illustration.  The League is doing splendid work, but as faras economic federation,  or even joint action, is concerned, we have to recognise that progress will bevery slow. In the second place, groups having a definite economic significance are even now in existence.The British Commonwealth itself is such a group.  It is no longer an &quot; empire &quot; in the older sense of the term, at  any rate as far  as the Dominions are concerned, but a confederation of self-governing nations.Quite apart from tariff &quot; preferences,&quot; the economic bonds between Britain and the Dominions are very close, in respect of both markets and raw materials.  This economic co-operation is not as completeas it could be, in theory, but it is nevertheless a fact, of which the Imperial Conference is one indication.The Pan-American group also exists, and has its periodical conferences, the Central American states in particular being definitely under the influence of the U.S.A. This economic solidarity is likely to grow even closer, for the loan of American capital, with all its attendant safeguards, will almost certainlycontinue as these  countries develop.  In  this case the tariff issue may be quite a minor  one.  Theregular meetings of Pan-Pacific Conferences foreshadow other possibilities, which vitally concern us,not as Great Britain, but as a Commonwealth group.    9. If there are already these groupings in existence, the entire question is far from being academic.Nor can it be said that these are isolated cases,  opposed to the general tendency of the time.  Persistentefforts have been made in recent years to form a Central European bloc, and the failure to achieve it hasbeen  due largely to political reasons.  The proposals for a European bloc have been discussed for thepast ten years, and a Committee has finally been instructed to report upon the scheme to the nextassembly of the League.  M. Briand&apos;s plan will almost certainly not receive widespread support, but other schemes will be elaborated that may prove more acceptable to the Continent generally. Inciden-tally, the Continental advocates of a European bloc do not usually assume that Britain will be a member.Faced as we are with these tendencies,  it  would be foolish  to imagine that international economicrelationships are going to remain on the same basis as in former times.  The common-sense policyis surely to look ahead and to determine how best Britain, in the light of present-day tendencies, canbuild up closer  economic bonds with those  nations whose interests appear to be complementary toour own.     10.  The two main factors that have to be considered are raw materials and markets.    . Raw Materials. In order to maintain  our present population we must maintain a large foreign trade.   There are many  essential raw materials and foodstuffs that Britain does not and cannotproduce :  cotton, rubber, tin, copper, oil, tea, etc., etc.   We  have to buy them with manufacturedgoods and services, in the main.  Supplies of such raw materials may in certain cases, by appropriate means, be assured to a  particular nation.     Markets. We have to sell our own products in order to buy necessary commodities  we cannotproduce, and in order to create the wealth to maintain forty-five million people in a country which, ifisolated, could not support anything like this number.  There is no limit  to the world&apos;s capacity to absorb manufactured goods, given the necessary machinery of finance  and distribution.  At any given time, however,  and because of the particular circumstances, there is a shortage of effective demand (purchasing power) and a consequent keen competition, between producers,  for markets.  Markets mayin certain cases and by appropriate means be assured to a particular nation.     11.  The important point in the discussion of economic agreements,  links,  groups, etc., is thepossibility of assuring, to this country, raw material, supplies and markets.  Let it be said at once thatthere is now no such thing as freedom in these matters.  Every nation and, in practice if not in theory,every party has long since abandoned the  notion of complete freedom of trade (which incidentally
 would necessitate freedom in buying and selling labour).   In almost every aspect of  economic life regulation and conscious control of economic factors and forces is the accepted policy.  Differences only concern the amount of regulation and control.  It may or may not be desirable to hold up world-wide freedom of trade as an ultimate ideal, but it is not and cannot be a working aim, in the immediate situation  of the  world to-day.  To the Trade Union and Labour movements it can  hardly  be an ultimate ideal, even, since these movements  rest on the belief that there should be conscious control of all economic and political factors that can be controlled,  in the interests of human welfare.   The notion that human welfare is, by some dispensation of providence,  best  advanced by a complete absence of restrictions  on  &quot; freedom of trade &quot; did not survive beyond the very early years  of the 19th century.     12. Thus, in discussing economic groups  of nations it is not necessary to assume the formation of definitely organised groups,  though one or two  such already exist,  as mentioned  above.   The implication  is rather that between the members of a particular set of countries economic links are created, which are designed to act to the mutual advantage of all the members.  Formal organisation of such a group may exist as well; it will be a convenience, but it is not essential.   What are the various types of such links that actually exist at present ?     13. First,  there may  be  agreements concessions for  the working of raw  materials,  mineral or otherwise.  These are important, for they may on the one side assure to a nation ample  supplies of commodities it lacks, while  at the same time an outlet is found for the investment or loan of surplus capital.  Further, the lending nation will supply machinery used in the exploitation of the concession and perhaps the transport also.  Thus, the lending country is assured, at  one stroke, of supplies of the raw material in question, of a market for surplus capital and of a market for machinery, etc.  The relations thus established may easily last after the concession expires.     14. Second, the ordinary investment of capital in industrial enterprises and loans to governments for public works have a similar result in providing a market for manufactured goods.  The condition is often attached to a loan that  the goods used must be purchased in the loaning country.   Given existing economic relations there  is nothing  unfair in this.   If a British loan  (which, in  the  main, comes out of the product of British industry), is granted to a foreign Government for the construction of public  works,  has not the  British lender  the right to say the materials  required shall be bought from Britain rather than from America ?  Where a Government loan  (coming  out of the taxpayers&apos; pockets) is involved, (as, for instance, to a Crown Colony), the case is even stronger.  Investments may lead to the same results..  For example, the control of a power supply company by foreign capitalists, through shareholdings,  may be  unimportant from the point of view of the policy of the company as regards the supply of power, but it may mean that equipment is in future bought from foreign firms or British subsidiaries of foreign firms.  America&apos;s trade with Russia has increased so greatly, despite the absence  of political recognition, because of the investment of American capital, the grant of con- cessions to American firms, etc.  The Five Year Plan is being pushed through with  American tractors, American power plant, and so on,  and also American technicians who recommend their own country&apos;s products in every possible direction.    15. In some  cases, again, there is legislative or treaty restriction of the exploitation of natural resources to the nationals of a particular country.  This, of course, is  contrary to the &quot; open door &quot;principle, but there is some justification for saying that if this principle is to be observed in one directionit should be observed all round.   Control over raw materials  may be sought in these ways in order to safeguard a country&apos;s supplies, e.g., the British Government participation in the ownership of Anglo- Persian Oil Company and important oil agreements in other parts of the world ;  British and American control of Canadian nickel, through International Nickel  Company.  Government  encouragement of cotton growing within the Commonwealth, through the British Cotton Growing Association (on which the Trade Unions are represented) and the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation, is another instanceof the same kind of policy.   The war-time arrangement by which  the British Government boughtup the whole  of  the Australasian wool clip  for several years, and thus acquired,  by arrangement with the Australasian Governments, a&quot; practical monopoly of the world&apos;s wool supplies, was  anotherinteresting example of  interference with the &quot; free &quot; flow of trade.    Immigration restrictions  and differentiations are  another factor affecting relationships.  The importance of such measures is not confined  to the actual transfer of labour.  An increase in wealthnormally follows,  assuming sufficient capital is forthcoming for further development, and the increasingpopulation provides a  new market for manufactured  goods.   The wholesale  migration of  Easternpeoples to any of the Dominions, were it allowed, would clearly create a very different market from thatcreated by the migration of British nationals on a similar scale.    16. The imposition of tariffs is another method for regulating commerce and interfering with the &quot; free &quot; flow of trade.  As has been shown, it is only one among many devices having a similar object,but it is perhaps  the best known to the general public, partly because of its intrinsic importance andpartly because it has historically been a highly  controversial political  topic. Tariffs need legislative action, and they are, therefore,  in the public eye, whereas many of the other methods referred to abovedo not receive the same publicity.   Many people who believe firmly in safeguarding  their trade or their labour by other forms of restriction and agreement are opposed &quot; on principle &quot; to  tariffs, though the object is precisely the same.  The truth is that it is impossible to generalise on any of these methods.Economic theory condemns the general policy of tariffs, but political rather than economic considera-tions are usually the determining factor.   In particular circumstances, where it is desired to help a specific trade, a tariff may be justifiable ;  there are always disadvantages as well as advantages, and
it is a matter for investigation in each case, in order to estimate whether there is or is not a net advantage in imposing a duty.  A decision may also involve setting political advantages against economic disadvan-tages, but the point is that these problems should not be approached with preconceptions based on the belief that certain fundamental principles or traditions must at all costs be adhered to ; it is all a matterof expediency in a  given situation.  The Labour Party has already adopted  the policy of completeexclusion of goods manufactured abroad under conditions less favourable to the workers than those laid down by International Labour Conventions.  Exclusion may be brought about by tariffs.  Tariffs,again, may in particular cases be made conditional on reorganisation of the industry in question. Thereare many such possibilities which are worth exploration on their merits. The Economic Committee hasnot so far  studied the matter, and offers no opinion whatever as to the probable  result if such an investigation were made.   The whole question should, however, be looked at without prejudice, and inthe light of present-day conditions.     17.  It will, by now, be clear that the question of developing closer economic links with other nationsmay be discussed without  special reference to tariffs.  There are many methods, of  which a few havebeen cited, by which such special relations may be developed. It appeared to the Economic Committeethat, in  the  light of the tendencies already mentioned towards greater  economic solidarity amongcertain groups of nations, we should be well advised to develop, as far as possible, such economic relationsbetween the  constituent parts of the British  Commonwealth as will be to our mutual advantage.  as already pointed out, such  a  policy, while helping to assure to us both raw  materials and expandingmarkets, would not interfere in the slightest degree with our policy of world-federation through theLeague, with our connection with the International Trade Union movement, or with other international agreements for particular industries.  The only difference, as already stated, is that  we should be ableto negotiate and discuss as a Commonwealth instead of as  a single nation, and  this would be a decidedadvantage  in many cases.Copied.

APPENDIX D.  NOTE  COVERING  THE  RESOLUTIONS  ADOPTED BY  THE CONGRESS  OF THE      FEDERATION OF CHAMBERS  OF COMMERCE OF THE BRITISH  EMPIRE.    1. The attached document (Enclosure No. 1)  contains  the resolutions adopted at the TwelfthCongress of the Federation of  Chambers of Commerce of the British Empire, held at the Guildhall,London, on 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th and 30th May, 1930.    2. It will be observed that a number of the resolutions raise matters which fall within the agenda of the Imperial  Conference, and attention is drawn particularly to resolutions 17 to 21  inclusiveregarding &quot; commercial relations within the Empire &quot;.    3. Briefly these resolutions are as follows : -          Resolution 17 urges the appointment of a Commission to draw up a scheme for effective      economic co-operation between the  various parts of the Empire, with a view ultimately to the      economic union of the whole.          Resolution 18 suggests that the various  governments of the Empire should examine their      fiscal policies with a view to amending them in the interests of the trade of the Empire.          Resolution 19 urges the extension of Imperial preferences.          Resolution 20  stresses the importance, inter alia,  of inter-Imperial  co-operation, trade      arrangements, and the promotion of scientific research, and exchange of visits and ideas between      business men of the Empire.          Resolution 21 resolves to carry the above four resolutions direct to the Imperial Conference      in session.                               [Enclosure No. 1 to Appendix D.]    THE FEDERATION OF CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE.         (Twelfth Congress, Guildhall, London, 2&amp;h, 27th, 28th, 29th and 30th May, 1930.)                                 RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED.                                    Commercial Arbitration.    (1) The Congress desires once again to draw attention to the Report of the Special Committeeof the  Federation on Arbitration within the Empire, published in 1927, containing particulars of thelaw of arbitration in almost every unit of the Empire and a set of model Arbitration Rules.  TheCongress calls upon all Chambers that have not yet done so to consider the adoption of the Rules  as early as possible, and thereby assist in placing commercial arbitration, throughout the Empire, ona sound and satisfactory basis.                                     Imperial Penny  Post.    (2) That  in  the opinion of this Congress  the time has arrived for the reintroduction  ofpenny  postage throughout the Empire.                                    Fixed Date for Easter.    (3) That this Congress reaffirms the resolutions which it has frequently passed in common with many other Associations in favour of a fixed date for  Easter, and in view of the unnecessary dislocationwhich a widely diverging date for Easter causes in educational, legal, banking, trade, commercial andother interests, urges His Majesty&apos;s Government to give effect to the Easter Act of 1928 with as little delay as possible.                                    Empire Cinema Films.    (A) That this Congress, impressed by the immense influence which  the cinematograph exercisesupon the social, political and economic ideals of nations, requests the Council of the Federation to take such steps as may be in their power to foster the growth of a film industry calculated to promoteBritish Empire interests.                                      Imperial Education.    (5) That this Congress has learned with much satisfaction that an, Empire text-book, in the formrecommended by previous Congresses, has been published, and that this book,  &quot; The British Empiresince 1783,&quot; has already been placed on the lists of various Education Authorities throughout theEmpire,  including the London County Council, for use in  the schools under their control.  ThisCongress, therefore, trusts that other Education Authorities will adopt a similar course ;  that all will introduce into their curricula the study of the Empire as a specific subject ; and that examining bodieswill co-operate in achieving the desired aims.
    (6)  Whereas  tradition and patriotism, founded upon knowledge,  form a strong and  enduringbasis upon which to consolidate and perpetuate the British Empire ; and    Whereas the  education of the young in the traditions, ideals and objects of the great Common-wealth of Nations now comprising this vast Empire, and accurate knowledge of its extent, traditionalcharacter, resources and  geography mathematical, physical and  political are potent factors in creating love and  respect for the type of Government, for the principle of individual freedom, respect for law  and its administration, and for the greatness and attractiveness of the several parts of theEmpire, and will cause rising generations to appreciate the value to themselves and to the  world, ofcementing the ties which bind the Empire together ;  and    Whereas it is common knowledge that certain text-books  used in some of the  schools of theEmpire give undue prominence to the history and traditions and other features of foreign lands andinsufficient consideration to the  Empire, and, in some instances, present a distorted mental picture of certain parts of the Empire by stressing abnormal rather than normal climatic and other conditions ;    Therefore be it resolved that the Twelfth Congress of Chambers of Commerce of the British Empirerecommend  to the Governments of Great Britain and of each of the self-governing and other unitsof the Empire           (a) That an  interchange of text-books of the Empire be arranged by the Governments      through their Education Departments.          (b) That reports of discrepancies or desirable improvements received be placed before the      proper educational authorities under whose jurisdiction the schools operate, where such books      are in common use, with a request that the desired amendments be made.          (c) That the  Council of the Federation be used as a clearing house by the Associations of      Chambers of Commerce throughout the Empire for the purpose of the exchange of information.                                    Commercial Education.    (7)  That this Federation should strongly support and advocate the wide extension of education for commerce throughout the Empire, including in such an educative course (a) technical and research work  in the  widest  sense, (b) Empire history and the elements of political economy  and finance,(c) qualification as Trade Commissioners and diplomatic ambassadors of commerce, and all cognatesubjects; so that in these days of international&apos;competition and of seeking for profitable markets,our young men  may be  sent  out  fully  equipped as skilled  experts  in  the  great laboratory of empire business.                                   Empire Canning Industry.    (8)  That this Congress, recognising the great potential value to the Empire of expansion of thecanning industry, and realising that large new markets for canned goods are to be found within itsboundaries,  welcomes the efforts of the Empire Canning Council to promote the canning of Empireproduce and in particular of native produce in tropical countries as being an important contribution towards the development of Empire industries.                               Inter-Empire Air Communications.    (9)  That this Congress of Federated Chambers of Commerce of the  British  Empire  desires to impress upon the Dominion, and Colonial Governments the importance of recognising the value totrade of rapid communications and considers  that, in view of the importance to the Empire of estab-lishing  a  complete network  of air routes, the Imperial and the respective Governments must beprepared to grant  and should declare their intention, at any rate in these early stages of its development,of granting subsidies for air transport.  Further, the Congress is  convinced that air services can mostrapidly be placed on a self-supporting basis  by the conveyance of mads,  to which the carrying of passengers and freight must,  for the present, remain subsidiary.    (10) That this Congress  of  Federated Chambers of Commerce of the  British  Empire, whilstwelcoming the establishment of the England-India Service during 1929 and its extension to  Delhi thisyear,  urges the Governments concerned, over whose territories the route will pass, to take all possible steps  to establish the ground organisation required for the completion of the route via Calcutta, burma and Singapore to  Australia.  The Congress also welcomes the coming inauguration of  the Cape-CairoService and urges that financial assistance be given towards the establishment of &quot; feeder  &quot; services to these two main Empire routes.                                    Provisions of Air Ports.    (11) That this Congress requests all Federated Chambers to impress  on the Local Authoritiesin the larger towns throughout the Empire the need for making immediate provision  for aerodromes and suggests that social attractions should be  provided there to bring people together and so to arouseinterest in flying.      &quot;...                    Air Mail  Postal Regidations.    (12) That in view of the fact that the immense postal  systems of the  world have been built upon flat  rate charges regardless of distance, this Congress of Federated Chambers of Commerce of theBritish  Empire is convinced that the development of air mail will be encouraged and accelerated bythe adoption of the same principle as soon as practicable.  They look forward ultimately to all first-classmail being sent by  air, when a saving of time can thus be achieved, without any surcharge beingimposed.  In the meantime,  they consider that the adoption of special flat rates for  air mail would
be highly beneficial to its development, instead of having as at present the ordinary postage rate on one basis and an air surcharge rate on another.  The regulation of the Universal Postal Union wherebyunder-franked air mail letters are refused and sent forward by the ordinary route is a serious handicapto the  more general use of the air mail and should be abolished forthwith, the deficit being collected from the recipients as in the case of other mail.  The Congress therefore urges that the Postal Authori-ties throughout the Empire should do everything possible to remove the obstacles at present existingto the  use of air mails.                                           Air Survey.     (13) That this Congress of Federated Chambers of Commerce of the British Empire recommends that, in view of the proved value of survey from the air, a general policy of surveying the unmappedareas of the Empire should be put into effect without delay, preparatory to the inauguration of a considered scheme for opening up its resources.                                    Aeronautical Education.     (14) That this Congress is of opinion that increased facilities  for the study of aeronautics shouldbe available  throughout the Empire for those who wish to take up aviation  in  all its branchesas a career.                                   Propaganda for Aviation.     (15) That this  Congress of Federated  Chambers of Commerce  of  the British Empire desires toexpress its appreciation of the valuable  aid given by the Press to the cause of civil aviation andto stress the great  service that the newspapers of the Empire can render in promoting a progressivepolicy of developing Imperial aviation.                                 Imperial  Wireless Telephony.     (16) That this  Congress desires to impress upon the Imperial Government the importance of theestablishment of wireless telephony throughout the Empire with  as little delay as possible and that every endeavour should be made for this means of communication to be in British hands.                            Commercial Relations within the Empire.     (17) That this Congress emphatically declares that the future economic well-being  of the peoplesowing allegiance to His Majesty the  King Emperor calls for a concerted, determined and immediateeffort on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Governments to formulate an economic policy for the  Empire whichwill  result in closer co-operation between  its constituent parts.  It recognises that under modern conditions, large and unfettered markets are essential for economic production.   It accordingly urgesupon the Imperial Conference to be held in London in September next, the appointment of a Corn-mission accredited by the Governments of the various parts of the Empire and having in its personneladequate representation of the business interests of the Empire and economic experts, to draw up awell-considered scheme for effective economic co-operation between  the various parts of the Empire,which will pay due regard to the industrial development of its various sections,  with  a view to thegreatest development of the potential resources of each section, and ultimately, on equitable terms,the economic union  of the whole.     (18) That the various Governments of the Empire be urged to examine into  their own fiscalpolicies without delay with a view to ascertaining in what respects they may be amended in the interestsof the trade of other portions of  the Empire with due regard to the  integrity  of their own commerce.     (19) This Congress once more reiterates its conviction that a wide  and well-considered extensionof the system of  Imperial Preferences will be found to be the most effective means of bringing about agreater measure  of Imperial economic cohesion.     (20) That this  Congress urges the  importance, in Empire trade of voluntary co-operation andco-ordination and reciprocity, inter-Imperial mergers and trade arrangements, the promotion of scientific research and the interchange of visits and more intimate exchange of ideas and experiences betweenbusiness men of the Empire.     (21) That this Congress of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the British Empire herebyresolves to convey  the four resolutions dealing with commercial  relations within the Empire direct to the approaching Imperial Conference in session by means of a representative deputation to be chosen by the Executive Committee of the Federation.                                       Customs Tariffs.     (22) That this  Congress of Chambers of  Commerce of the British Empire regrets that when thevarious Empire Self-Governments are effecting material increases in their Customs Tariff Schedulesthey show so little consideration for the interests of those handling the goods affected, and is of opinionthat such changes should not apply to a commodity actually shipped or in transit at the time of suchtariff change, and  requests that the President of the Council of  the Federation of Chambers ofCommerce of the British Empire take the necessary steps to secure the consideration of this  questionwhich  has such an  important  bearing on our  inter-Empire  relationships  at the forthcoming imperial Conference.
                                      Imperial Handbook.     (23) This Congress is of opinion that action should be taken to compile a concise and serviceableintroductory handbook, setting forth the principal features and potentialities agricultural, mineral,industrial, social, scenic and  general of Great  Britain, the various Dominions and other sections ofthe British Empire.     That such action should be  developed after consultation  and in co-operation with the various governments concerned.                                        Trade Statistics.     (24) The Congress considers  that  uniformity in  trade statistics would be  of great value inthe development of inter-Imperial trade, and accordingly invites the Governments of those parts of theEmpire which do not at present do so, to prepare annual trade returns under the same classificationsto cover each calendar year.                       (This resolution was subsequently embodied in No. 40.)                                    Commercial Information.     (25) That  this Congress, being of opinion that access  to  authentic and up-to-date commercialinformation and statistical data is essential for the successful conduct of inter-Imperial trade, recom-mends the Chambers of Commerce of the Empire to consider the  advisability of establishing, wherethey have not already done so, adequate and efficient  Information and Statistical Departments.                                        Bills  of Lading.     (26) The Congress reaffirms the resolution of the Eleventh Congress,  Cape Town : &quot; That having in view  the  great  advantages which will  result from uniformity throughout the  Empire of rules for the carriage of goods by sea, this Congress, whilst noting with satisfaction the progress which hasalready been made in this direction, urges those Dominions, Colonies and Protectorates which havenot so far adopted legislation similar to the British Carriage of Goods by  Sea Act to take steps to that end at the earliest possible date.&quot;                                     Certificates of Quality.     (27) This Congress is of opinion that it would greatly facilitate and encourage inter-Empire tradeif some scheme could be approved to remove the  difficulties which often arise in regard to merchandise,the condition or quality of which has to be established to  the satisfaction of the  authorities in thecountry of import.     The trader who ships merchandise in good faith  believing it to be of  a given condition or quality,is placed in  a position of great difficulty if the contrary is asserted by the import authorities.     It should be possible for the Governments  in countries of import, after consultation with tradebodies and Chambers of Commerce, to select bodies or institutions in the  countries of export whosecertificates they would be prepared to accept for particular named commodities.   Where necessary,the character of such approved certificates could be formulated and safeguards insisted upon by theapproving authority.  A list  of any such approved certificate-issuing bodies should be published fromtime to time so that traders could take advantage of the valuable facility of knowing beforehandthe condition or quality which would be accepted by the authorities in the country of import.    The Congress urges that  the possibility of assisting Empire trade in  this way should be earnestlyconsidered by Empire Governments at the forthcoming Imperial Economic Conference, and that theobject in view should be to have the greatest possible uniformity within  the Empire in standards  and methods of analysing and testing each commodity.                                        Domestic Value.     (28) That  in the interests of Imperial Trade it is desirable that all Dominions should endeavourto arrive at a common measure of agreement as to what consitutes current domestic value for the assessment of ad valorem duties.                                        Standardisation.     (29) The Congress draws the attention of Empire manufacturers to the value of standardisation,and in view of  its importance to Empire trade invites Empire buyers to include in their tender formsa clause requiring all goods not  otherwise specified  to be  in accordance with  British StandardSpecifications where such exist.                                        Sugar Industry.     (30) Whereas the serious situation  of the Colonial sugar industry cannot be too strongly urged,more especially in those Colonies which are unable to grow alternative crops,     And whereas the present crisis in the  industry is  due to over-production throughout the world,stimulated largely by high tariffs and subsidies.     Be it resolvedthat this Congress is of opinion that His Majesty&apos;s Government should make everyeffort to save the sugar industry of the Empire.     (31) That  the  Executive Committee be requested to consider what are the  best steps to  take to investigate thoroughly the economic possibilities of treating sugar cane for its commercial contents,testing the possibilities of producing from its lower grade syrups and molasses, power alcohol, beverages,yeast, dry ice,  fertiliser, carbonic acid gas, fusel oil, selotex, artificial silks, and such other productsas it may be found profitable to produce.
  SUPPLEMENTARY RESOLUTIONS TAKEN  BY PERMISSION  OF  THE  CONGRESS.                            Industrial and Commercial Opportunities.    (36) The Congress is of the opinion that greater attention could be paid by industrialists throughoutthe Empire to the openings in the respective Empire markets for the establishment of branch industries and warehouses, and urges the desirability of laying before its members information concerning suchopportunities.                                    Open Doors for Capital.    (37) The Congress would direct the attention of the Federation to the open doors which exist in the Dominions and Colonies for a greater flow of capital into investments in plant and equipment for industrial and commercial purposes, and would recommend that after competent advice has been secured, greater cognisance be taken of these openings by the business men of the Empire.                        Co-ordination of Commercial Intelligence  Services.    (38) Recognising that the British consular and commercial diplomatic services in foreign countries and  the British Trade Commissioner services in the  Dominions  are  constantly collating  a veryconsiderable amount of commercial intelligence data which is of practical interest, not only to the exporters of Great Britain, but also to the exporters of the Dominions and Colonies, the Congressrecommends to the British Government that ways and means be explored as to (1) whether it is feasible to pool this commercial intelligence data for the benefit of the entire Empire  and (2) whether thereis room for greater co-ordination of the British consular and diplomatic commercial services and theTrade Commissioner services  of the Empire units.                           Map  of Empire and Economic Text Book.    (39) The Congress would urge upon  the  Federation that under its direction a British Empiremap of the world and/or globe be designed, and, after preparation, made available to Empire schools,showing graphically  the trade routes, resources, principal imports and  exports, etc., and indicatingin an interesting and intelligible way the economic geography of the Empire units, and that consideration might well be given to the preparation, in conjunction with the Royal Empire Society, of a text-bookin connection therewith.                                       Empire  Statistics.    (40) Recognising that there exists an unfortunate lack of unification in Empire trade statisticswhen, for instance, units of weights and measurements, etc., vary in respect to the same commoditiesthroughout the Empire units ;  when descriptions of the same commodity vary in the different partsof the Empire ;  when the same commodities  are tabulated in  the official statistics of one part of theEmpire and not in others; and when the same volume of trade statistics sometimes includes tradefigures which are at  variance ;  and recognising the slowness with  which Empire trade statistics aresometimes released;  the  Congress recommends to the  Governments  of the  Empire a  greater co-ordination and despatch in the issuing of trade statistics, which should in each case be made up tocover the calendar year.                                     Congo Basin Treaties.    (32) That this Congress while insisting  upon  the necessity  of developing Imperial Preferencewherever possible, recognises the special circumstances existing in the area in Africa, covered by the series of International Treaties and Conventions commonly known as the Congo Basin Treaties, wherebyequal commercial opportunity is granted to all nations parties to the Treaties.    This Congress is accordingly of the opinion that, in the general interests of Imperial trade in those 1regions and in view  of the primary importance of an accomplishment  of an economic unification ofthe Territories of Uganda, Kenya and Tanganyika, these Treaties should be left undisturbed at present,except that a slight alteration in the boundaries should be further considered if this can be done withoutimperilling the Treaties as a whole.                                           Taxation.    (33) That to  secure employment  for  all who  have the will to work, and to re-establish the prosperity of British trade, commerce and industry, the pressing burden of taxation should, as far aspossible, be  removed from manufacturing business and productive industries within the Empire.                                      British Nationality.    (34)  The Congress calls upon the Governments  of the Empire to implement the resolution of the tenth Congress, 1924, endorsed by  the Imperial Conference, 1926, urging legislation in order to permit of the acquisition  of British  nationality by children of the third generation born abroad of Britishparents during the period between  the date of the commencement of the War (4th August, 1914) and4th August, 1922, the date when the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1922, came intooperation.                                         Bankruptcy. ,   (35)  The Congress expresses  its approval of the action  of the Executive  Committee of theFederation in appointing  a Special Committee to draw up a Report setting forth the law of bankruptcyin each part of the Empire, and trusts that this will lead to practicable recommendations for assimilatingthe bankruptcy and insolvency legislation throughout the Empire.
                                     Educating Consumers.    (41) The Congress is of the opinion that, in the desirable work of educating consumers throughoutthe Empire units in the use of Empire goods, the Federation might well lay emphasis on the advantages to be derived from making greater use  of  displays of Empire products  at  the  different fairs andexhibitions throughout the Empire.                             Promoting the Sale of Empire  Goods.    (42) That this Congress is of opinion that an effort should be made by Chambers of Commerceoverseas to organise  campaigns  for voluntary  preference to be  given to Empire goods in their territories, on the same  lines as the campaign which is being carried on  by the  Empire MarketingBoard in Great Britain.                     Co-ordination of Existing Empire Economic Agencies.    (43) The Congress urges the desirability of endeavouring to bring about a greater co-ordinationof all existing agencies devoted  to the amplification of Empire economic interests throughout great Britain, the Dominions and Colonies.                                       Moving Pictures.    (44) The Congress is of the opinion that if and when the Commission referred to in resolution no. 17 is appointed, the  Commission might, through a sub-committee, profitably study the possibilitiesof the production and distribution of moving pictures throughout the Empire and also their influence on Empire trade and commerce.
