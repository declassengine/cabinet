173fsDOCUMSNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;&apos;S GOVERIliLENT). CR,g t&apos;.306(30)Copy No.      CABINET.The draft &quot;Statute of Westminster&quot;Rsactions of its provisions on the Indian        Constitutional question.  Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.          What looks like being a serious difficulty is raised by the draft &quot;Statute of Westminster&quot; in its present form.          It seems to me clear that we must leave the way open,as the result of the Indian Round Table Conference, to enable us, should we decide that course is right, to give India atleast the designation of &quot;Dominion&quot; even though her constitutionalrelationship with the United Kingdom and the other Dominions      for  some time may remaindifferent from that of the existing Dominions.  Butthe draft Statute of Westminster, if it is accepted at theImperial Conference in the form in which it is now drawn, willpreclude this step being taken without the assent of all theother Dominions, and without the necessary alteration of theBill or Act, as the case may be;  for Clause 2 of the Billdefines the expression :!Dominion;! for the purpose of this Actand of every Act passed hereafter, as meaning the existingDomini:ns, and the Preamble pre-supposes no amendment of thisStatute once passed without the concurrence of all theexisting Dominions.  It follows a fortiori that, if and whenIndia is given full Dominion Status, the Statute of Westminsterwill have to be made applicable to her as it is to the otherDominions and that that process v/ill also, as the Bill is                                                      nowSUM
-    179                                                                2. now drafted, apparently require the assent of the other Dominions.          what I 7/ish to propose  for the consideration of the Cabinet is that the Bill should be so altered as to                                    India leave the United Kingdom free to makeAa Dominion of the kind to which this Bill applies whenever this course is thought right, and, in the meantime, if necessary, to call her a Dominion without in either case the assent of the other Dominions being required - and I suggest that the Parliamentary draftsman should be instructed to make definite proposals to this effect. I realise, of course, that the presentation of the Bill in the form I have suggested to the Imperial Conference may possibly raise the whole question there of India &apos;s present status and designation, and her future Constitution, and of the nature and extent of/the interests of the other Dominions in these matters. On the other hand, if some provision of the kind I suggest is hot now inserted, the matter will undoubtedly be raised by the Indian Delegation at the Imperial Conference  and,  later,  at the Indian Round Table Conference;  and the mere presentation of a draft Bill in the present form and,  much more,  its acceptance by the Imperial  Conference might well week what chances the Indian Conference has of producing, an acceptable solution.           I would remind my colleagues that  while I am raising this question with reference to India,  similar questions  maywell arise hereafter with regard to other parts of the Supire - e.g. Southern Rhodesia.   It seems to me unwise to  allow the ;iStatute of V/westminster&quot; to be framed in such a way  as to stereotype the British Commonwealth in  its present form,  without regard to  the possibility that other parts of the  Empire  may                                                     attain
&apos;     1                                                             3-attain the status of the present &quot;Dominions&quot;.    Obvious  andgrave difficulties will arise if the consent of everyexisting Dominion must be obtained before a new Dominion canbe recognised as such.                                   W.B.  12th September 1930.
