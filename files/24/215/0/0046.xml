I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum by  theSecretary for Mines, with which I am in general agreement.Should the Cabinet decide that we must, for the present,  abandona measure to deal with this subject, I should propose  to  justifythat decision by reference to the preosure of parliamentary business and the urgency of other measures.Board of Trade,    16th October, 1930
     Now that the question of our Parliamentary Programme  isunder discussion, I wish to i-aise the question of the RoyaltiesBill which was contemplated by a Cabinet decision of october last and which, I understand, Is provisionally included in thelegislation to be forecasted by the next King&apos;s speech.     My own view is that we should not contemplate a RoyaltiesBill in any form during this session.   Whatever form it took,it would be of a&quot;very contentious character, and would occupya great deal more Parliamentary time than, as it seems to me, wecan afford, or indeed would wish, to devote to further coallegislation at present.   It is impossible moreover in presentcircumstances to introduce it in a form which would be of any real advantage either to the industry or to the Party,     Immediate nationalisation of all mineral rights In coalwithout compensation, or with only partial compensation, wouldhave advantages both to the industry and to the Party, but while we are in a minority this is out of the question.  Immediatenationalisation with full compensation would bring vary littlematerial benefit to the Industry, and, though it would have some political value, this would not be sufficient to outweigh the financial and other advantages of the &quot;gradual scheme&quot;which was approved by the Cabinet in October of last year.     The scheme before us therefore is this &quot;gradual scheme&quot;.Under this scheme a State Commission would acquire mineral rights as leases fell In for renewal, or on such other occasionsas it saw an immediate practical reason for taking them over,paying full compensation for everything acquired which has any value at the present time, but paying nothing for any &quot;unproved&quot;coal which at present has no value.     I cannot think that this method of dealing with theproblem - though the only practicable method in present circum-stances - offers sufficient advantage  to the Party to counter-
balance the difficulties of securing its passage.   Indeed I doubt whether our own Party would be unitedly in favour of ameasure which not only gave practically no material benefit tothe industry, and in particular to the miners, but also postponedState acquisition for an indefinite period.     I do not wish to stress the degrej  of opposition which it-would evoke from the Tory benches.   It is relevant, nevertheless,to call attention to the fact that it is not only that thegeneral principle of State acquisition would be opposed in thisquarter, but that several of the more &quot;special&quot; features, which appear to be necessary and important parts of it,  would in themselves be highly contentious.   Examples are the refusal ofcompensation for &quot;unproved&quot; coal or reversionary interests; thepayment of compensation by relatively short-term annuitiesj theInclusion of powers of compulsorily acquiring surface rights;the provision for cancelling or altering the terms of existingleases; and&apos;(perhaps the most complicated question of all) the drastic alteration of the basis on which the present law of&quot;support&quot; stands.     Many other^polnts might be instanced, all pointing to thedifficulties, both of drafting and of carrying the Bill through parliament, and also to the amount of Parliamentary time whichit would occupy  in its passage.     If we could shew that the Bill will be cf  financial benefitto the industry by relief from the burden of wayleaves and minimum rents, we might secure enough credit to make thepolitical fight worth while.  But we cannot pay full compensation to the royalty owners and at the same time benefit the industryfinancially unless we are prepared to make a present to the coalowners out of State Funds.     The only other material benefit to the &quot;Industry would bethe removal of obstacles to the proper development of pits by re-
  arrangement of boundaries,  simplification of  leases  and measures  of that nature, most  of which can already be. secured in a less  direct way by the Working  Facilities  Act, 1923.       To sum up -  (a)  The Bill will,  in my  opinion, give practically  no advantage       to anyone (beyond an  assurance to the private owners that       they will have  full compensation for everything which  is       of any present value  to them) and at the same time       postpones State  acquisition for  an indefinite number of       years.  (b)  While It will meet with very strong opposition  from the       Tory and Liberal benches on every point, it  will contain       some matters on which opinion in our party will be divided.  (c)  It will be a most complicated and controversial measure       which will require a  great deal  of Parliamentary time.  (d)  We are very fully occupied in trying to  make the recent       Coal Mines Act  a valuable piece  of legislation  (which  the       possibility of  doing  still more  by building  on  to the       present structure) and It would  be a mistake at this       stage to divert  our attention from this  to such a       difficult and controversial measure.       One feature of  the proposed Bill which appeals  to me is  the proposal that all unproved coal (i.e. coal which has no  market value at the  present time) should belong to the State  without payment.  Even this apparently simple proposal Is by  no means free from difficulty, but If the Cabinet desire, I  will examine the problem carefully to ascertain whether it  is possible to present a relatively short and simple measure  directed to this one  point, as a first instalment of a much  wider policy.                                                G.Shlnwell.The President,                                  15th  October,1950.   Board of Trade.
