Arbitration Treaty witn U.S.A. Memorandum by the Naval Staff.          The Naval Staff consider it is of the utmost importance to this country that if a compulsory arbitration treaty is to be negotiated with the U.S..A. the question of belligerent rights at sea should &quot;he definitely reservedand they request that the following statement of their viewsbe placed before the Cabinet and also the Delegates at theImperial Conferenoe who vdll be considering the subject ofarbitration treaties.          Whilst it may be the oase that &quot;belligerent rights&quot;are technically justiciable issues, any dispute regarding them is really more of a politioal than a legal nature,  and it isgenerally agreed that political questions should,  if theythreaten to bring on hostilities,  be adjusted through other means, such as conciliation.  In the event of a world-widewar no country should expect Great Britain when fighting forits life to hold up for arbitration acts which it consideredlegitimate and essential in order to bring pressure to bear onan enemy.          ,,The maintenance of belligerent rights is essential in order to enable sea power to be properly exercised in thedefenoe of the Empire,  and the right that may be challengedmay involve momentous political issues affecting not only thiscountry but the effective fulfilment of our Locarno guaranteeor cf our aotion in support of the oovenants of the league should the Cabinet have deoided to declare war against aviolator of the Covenant.          If we have a compulsory arbitration treaty with.S.A. - a treaty which it is understood may be followed byother bilateral treaties of compulsory arbitration  with various nations - the possible prospect of having to  submit                                                   our....
our naval actions to some international court wouldcertainly hamper the Admiralty in giving orders to  the  Sleetas to the carrying out of measures which were consideredlegitimate at the time (s?r even which have been consideredlegitimate in our Prize Courts) but yet could not be definitely regarded as having received general internationalsanction.          The activities of the Royal Navy in time  of warraise issues from the outset that may be challenged by .S.A. owing to the clash of two conflicting rights:&quot;The right of the belligerent to make use of his naval strength to interfere with the seaborne commerce of theenemy, and the right of the neutral to continue his tradeirrespective of the existence of a war in which he is notengaged&quot; . .*..&quot;No one, however, will suggest that theestablishment of rules of international law on this subjecthas reached a stage which eliminates the possibility of disputes between belligerents and neutrals&quot;. - Cmd.Paper3452, paragraph 19.          The Naval Staff feel very strongly that by accedingto the proposed Treaty of Arbitration with IL,S.A., withouta reservation in regard to belligerent rights, we shallbe voluntarily surrendering one of our greatest weapons in time of war and one of the great safeguards against another Power declaring war against us, as other Powersdread the exercise in full of naval belligerent rights.By maintaining these belligerent rights and not making them liable to challenge in an International Court inwar the Naval Staff believe we fa) reduce the chances of                                                    war....
                      - 3 -war with  Continental and  Asiatic Povrars.., and  (b)  thus minimis as far as possible chancos of trouble with  the TJ. S.A. arising out of such wars.      The Naval Staff endorse the following  views  of the late  First Sea Lord on 9th February, 1929:-                 ;iI view with the gravest misgivings  from  tho       point of view of the Naval Of floor -the idea of        arbitration, particularly as  I feel  convinced that a        bodiy constituted like the Permanent  Court  of  Inter-        national Justice would give an adverse  de^-inton on        the following issues that. .aros4j^Jja- aha -Great ., - War^^nd        may be.-important in another war -                  Retaliation.                  Continuous voyage in relation to  conditional                    contraband.                  Diversion.                  Inclusion of many articles in the list of                    absolute contraband.                  Examination of mails.                  Convoy                  Mining                  Angary                  Such decision may be given by such  a body      largely constituted of biassed  neutrals in the  early      stages of a long war, and even  pending the arbitral      decision, the Court or the Keutral will ask  us  to stop      the practice complained of, and the Kavy  will almost      certainly be instructed accordingly.                  As I see it, our sea power will  be  stultified         Tho  Naval Scaif  realise that  under the Paot ofPeace the High Contracting Paxtios jOgrsed  hat  a aettleinentor solution of disputes shall never be  sought except  by&quot;pacific, means*. but.-they think that compulsory arbitration
is not, therefore,  involved, the solution of tho dispute being sought by some other means than arbitral decision,  just aa it presumably will be sought should a dispute arise about the four specific matters that are definitely reserved in the proponed arbitration treaty or about non-justioiablo matters.           It may be expedient to recall the view that it is very difficult for a Court composed of international lawyors to realise that what they have got to do is not to aPP!y &quot;t^9 rules which they will find in the textbooks based on tho experience of  ho past, but to endeavour to discover what ahould be regarded as the applicable rules of inter- national law in the circumstances of tho war. Few oountries established Prize Courts during the Great War that dealt with belligerent rights at sea. and the majority  for example, of the members of  the Permanent Court of International Justice might to our detriment adhere to obsolete ideas and condemn the modern applications of old principles.           No oode can really be produced whioh can foresee the contingencies of war twenty, thirty or fifty years honce. The Declaration of  London in 1909 and the war in 1914 mado manifest the  impossibility of forosight in such matters ovon for so short a period as fivo years ahoad. Had our Belligeront flights boon admitted as subject to arbitration in 1909 following on tho Declaration of London, wo should have been taken to arbitration by neutrals in 1914 **n3 been deprived of our principal weapons                                                 for...o
 for exorcising economic pressure,  thereby--rnaterdnlly prolonging the war.            The  Naval Staff hope that His Majesty &apos;s Government will use evory moans in its power to dissuade the present U.S.A. Administration from pressing for theKellogg Arbitration Draft to be proceeded with, and to persuade them that the Pact itself,  together with a Conciliation Treaty, will  completely meet every requirement. But- if the present draft is relentlessly pressed, the Naval Staff would profer to oxiclude specifically belligerent rights from arbitration, oven although it might involve a possible risk that U.S.A. would summon a Conference to codify  maritime international law.        The atmosphere surrounding the question of belligerent rights has changed daring the last two years by reason both of the success of the London Conference, which has made the United  States loss likely to ro^-open a contentious subject, and the issue of Cmd.Paper 3452 dealing with belligerent rights and the  Optional Clauoem which was a clear manifesto to the world of the importance of belligerent rights to this country  and in which our signature of the Optional Clause was defended largely by the fact that the obligations involved applied only in practice to members of the League and that in future the conditions which might produce a justiciable dispute botweon this country as a belligerent and another member of the League as a neutral would not exist. The argument wa3 furthor developed that if the League failed the optional clauso itsolf woull cease to have effect and we should, under such circumstances if a belligerent,  retain our full freedom in regard to belligerent right action. This  would not be so,however if meanwhile we had engaged in arbitration  treaties with the
TJ-SoJL. -and., others in which the- question cf &quot;belligerentrights was not reserved,, condition that tne  compromise  shall he  agreed to &quot;on thepart of His Majesty1 s Dominions by His, Majesty The King inaccordance with constitutional practice&quot; does not appear to&quot;be a sufficient safeguard for a vital question of such importance as belligerent rights.   The Treaty imposes amoral obligation to submit to arbitration, and any attemptto use the safeguard for the purpose of evading  its provisions would appear calculated  in time of war merely toincrease any irritation and friction arising from theexercise of belligerent rights that affect American  commei-ce.          In conclusion, the Naval  Staff desire  to emphasiseone points  There may be minor wars in which the royal navy is taking action against a recalcitrant member  of theleague, and (if this Arbitration Treaty is accepted), aright may be challenged by UPSoA..-, and decided against bythe Arbitration Court.  The result  will be that  that rightIs lost for all time and could not  be authorised in  thefuture, even in a most momentous waraNAVAL STAFF.   8th October, 1930.Tbe proposod safeguard in the Treaty, namely the
