IT  is necessary to decide without delay the line we are  to  take  in theimmediate future on our Unemployment Insurance policy.  While it is yet too early to say what will be the precise outcome of the advisory committee of the three parties on unemployment insurance^ I think it may be assumed that there will be agreement in the view that there should be a review of the arrangements for assisting the able-bodied unemployed,  and that probably this review  should be  made  by a  RoyalCommission.  This, however, will take time, and although I should  hope  to be ableto speed up such a Commission and obtain their recommendations within  twelvemonths, there would then have to be consideration of their report and the passingof the necessary legislation.  Meanwhile, we have to deal with the position as it isto-day, and so far as the advisory committee is concerned, there is no common agree-ment at present on what should be done pending the report of the Royal Commission.I cannot say how close we may bfe able to get in this respect, but as the Committeewill be meeting again on the 23rd October, I should like to have guidance on the line which I should adopt.    2.  The paper which  I circulated to the  Cabinet on the 9th July,  1930 CP.  235  (30) contains  a general survey  of  the difficult problems  involved,particularly as regards transitional  benefit.  As the  figures of expenditure  are  so large, it is  perhaps advisable that I should recapitulate  them  here, with certainrevisions based on recent data : &apos;Unemployment Insurance   -    Debt at present  ...    Increasing at the rate of  ...    Contributions paid by workpeople    Contributions paid by employers    Contributions paid by Exchequer    Cost of Ordinary benefit paid out of FundTransitional benefit:  Cost paid by  Exchequer,        which may be    Total of Ordinary benefit paid out of the Fund        and Transitional benefit paid by Exchequer    (For every 100,000 the Live Register increases,        the expenditure will increase at the rate of        about  4,500,000 per annum)Public  Assistance   paid  by   Public   Assistance        Authorities ...

[21811]                                                        B
     3.   Certain things seem to be.obvious :      (1) The borrowing powers must be increased.   The existing limit of  60,000,000 .   .        will be reached by January  or  earlier.   With a  live register of over            two millions and already a prospective charge upon the Exchequer this            year of  36 millions, there is really no practicable alternative to.continued            borrowing,  unless we  are prepared to face reduced benefits or increased            contributions^  I should mention that  a further  10,000,000  borrowing            power, making a total of  70,000,000, would not be likely to last beyond            next March.  Therefore more than this would be required, if yet another            Bill for borrowing powers  before the  date of the next Budget is to be            avoided.  It is a question,  therefore, whether the amount of additional            borrowing powers now to be sought should not be  20,000,000.     (2) The transitional  period  begins  to  run  out next April.   The  Advisory            Committee  started with a  predisposition in favour of an  intermediate            scheme  (i.e., something between the Unemployment Fund and the Public            Assistance  Committee but financed  nationally  like  transitional benefit)            for those for whom,  so far,  transitional benefit has  catered.  Such  a            scheme  would be in the direction of making the unemployed a national            charge,  as contemplated in &quot;Labour and the  Nation&quot;; the same idea            is included in  the Liberal Yellow  Book and was. referred  to in the            speeches of several Conservative  Members last Session.   Some of the            problems  which would  be  raised  in  fashioning  such a  scheme  were            reviewed  in CP.  235  (30) see,  in particular, pages 5  to 7.  After            considering the problems, the  scheme did not seem to find quite so  much            support  in the Advisory  Committee.   Failing  such  a  scheme,  the            transitional period must be extended. This is the only  practicable means            of avoiding throwing  the  burden  on to the new Public Assistance            Authorities. It is suggested that these Authorities are not yet ready to            take over additional duties  and liabilities, and  in any  case we could not            make this  change  before  the Royal  Commission  had  reported and            advised as to terms and conditions.     (3) The  Royal Commission should be set up, to report as quickly as possible.     It  should be  noted,  however, that any  legislation arising  from  a  RoyalCommission^ report is not likely to be passed till towards  the end  of the 1932session.  This will mean,  unless  something else  is done meantime,  very  heavyfinancial commitments,  viz., an additional expenditure on transitional benefit (whichat present costs the Exchequer about  21,000,000 a year) for an extended period ofat least 18  months, and further  borrowing in the neighbourhood  of  36,000,000a year so long as we have a Live Register of  the present dimensions.     4.  For  these financial reasons and also for political reasons it is important todecide whether, pending the report of the  Royal  Commission, we  should propose any amendments in the scheme in  order  to deal with alleged abuses.  On the advisorycommittee the Conservatives have been pressing the view  that  the fund  should bemade  to balance forthwith by reducing (arbitrarially and  artificially)  the numberschargeable  to the fund, and transferring the  rest to the Exchequer.   The Liberals    * Reduction of Benefit. A reduction of the rates of benefit is the most  direct and probably themost effective way of reducing  expenditure.  It might  be argued that justification for the reduction is  to be found in the financial position of the  Unemployment Fund and in  that  of the Country-generally.  The cost of living has fallen considerably over the last few  years, while the rate of benefit(over-all) has risen.  Thus in 1924 the cost of living index was about 70 and the rate of benefit (man,ihis wife and two children) was  27/-.  The cost of living is now down  to 55  (with every prospect of falling  below  50) and the rate of benefit is up  to 30/-.  A reduction of 2/- would result  in a  saving of  about  9,000,000 per annum.  Any reduction  would, of course,  be criticised as reactionary, and.the political difficulties are formidable unless there can be agreement  between the Three Parties.    Increase of Contributions.-The present contributions (for  men) are : employer 8f7., employed 7d.,Exchequer lid.  It may be  argued that when the revenue of the Fund is so very much smaller thanthe expenditure steps ought to  be taken to increase  the revenue.  This has been done in Germany(where, even before the increase, the ratio of contributions to wages was much higher than with us),and it seems  to have been accepted as the natural thing to do. An increase of Id. all round  would yield about  5A million additional revenue; an increase of 3d. all round would give about  164 million.The  argument  against increase  in contribution is that it would mean an additional burden  uponindustry. On the other side it could be argued,  however, that  the feeling that the scheme  is insolventand is piling up a large debt, the liquidation of which may involve large charges upon the taxpayer,is itself unsettling to industry.   No less unsettling is the view  that the Government are content to letsuch an insolvent situation  continue without adequate efforts to cope with  it. An increase of 3d.in  the  employees contribution  is probably  about one-quarter of 1 per cent,  increase upon the cost-of  production.
incline to the view that the Commission should be appointed on the basis that weare committed to the &quot;principle&quot; that the fund should balance on the present live register.   These proposals are so impracticable that I should not feel any difficultyin dealing with them in the House.  At the same time I should, of course,  have to-tell the House that the terms of reference to  the Commission would be on the basis that the revised scheme is to be self-supporting.     5.  In view of what I expect will  be the  attitude of both the Conservatives andthe Liberals in the House when we propose the extension of the transitional periodwith additional borrowing powers, it would, I think, be advisable to say to the house that, while we feel bound to await the advice of the Royal Commission before making any considerable changes in the scheme, we intend to make such reasonable readjust-ments as  are practicable in the meantime.  As to this, certain points  particularlyattract attention, notably, certain classes of claimants :              (a) Seasonal workers;             (b) Short-time workers; and             (c) Married women.    6.types :-As to seasonal workers, it is necessary to draw a distinction between two     (i) Where there is a busy season  alternating with a  slack season,  as  in the          building,  clothing and certain other trades.  There are large numbers in          this class.  This  is, however, really one of the main types of unemploy-          ment for which the insurance scheme was  intended to provide, and is not          one of the things which attract public  attention  as an abuse.    (ii) Where (as in herring fishing and curing, the sugar  beet industry and fruit          picking) the work is of a wholly seasonal character beginning and ending          on some more or  less definite date.    The type in (ii)  can be divided again into two groups :     (a) Where the workers work only during the season and do not seek employment          at any other time or in any other district.    (b) Where, while the  main occupation is  the  seasonal, one, the workers seek to          obtain,  and sometimes succeed in obtaining, employment during  the off          season.    The alleged abuse is that a number of people  are said to be holding themselvesout as seeking work during the off  season, while  they have  no  real thought ofobtaining  it.  The numbers involved are comparatively small in any one industry orcalling. The decisions which have been given by the Umpire run on  lines with whichlittle  fault can be  found.   He has  said that where  the only work  available in thedistrict is the seasonal work, applicants must be held  to be &quot;not available for work &quot;if their domestic circumstances prevent them  from taking work at  a distance from home.  The numbers involved probably are not large compared with  the total numberof the unemployed; but comparatively few bad cases attract a good deal of attention,and I  think that we might  consider whether  benefit should only be granted if theCourt  of  Referees are satisfied that the  claimant intends  to obtain, and  (havingregard to the industrial circumstances in the district)  can reasonably expect to obtainduring the off season, employment in the district in which he or she is residing.    7.  Short-time is a very different  matter.  Large numbers  are  involved.   as some guide to the size of the problem, I give the following figures of  the &quot; temporarystoppages &quot;* at  four dates:                        Date.

    These figures, while, as I say,  giving  some guide, show only the number of-claimants who were not working on the date when the count was taken.  On the onehand, some of those temporarily stopped are not short-time workers in the ordinarysense;  on the other hand, there are probably many short-time workers who were atwork on the day of the count.    8.  Short-time working as a means of  meeting  trade depression and avoiding the discharge of well-tried workpeople is a well established practice. It was actuallyencouraged  by  the Government when the  industrial depression  began, doubtless inthe belief that the  depression  would be short lived,  and in December 1920 theMinister of Labour issued a circular letter to Joint Industrial  Councils and other bodies stressing the advantages of short-time working as a method  of alleviatingunemployment.  In recent years there has been a greater resort to short-time workingthan in pre-war years.  There is no definite evidence of the extent to which employersand workers may have exploited the  unemployment insurance scheme, but there is ageneral impression that when employers find it necessary to curtail production theyarrange short-time working in such a way as to enable the workers  to satisfy thecontinuity rules for benefit.     9.  The policy of short-time may be  criticised on the ground that it increases the ratio of over-head charges per unit of  production and so prevents  that reductionin costs which  full production concentrated in the most efficient plants would make possible.  The  cotton  industry is a prominent example in these respects. Short-time working may also conceal the real surplus of workers in a contracting industry and delay the necessary readjustment to changed conditions.  The  tendency to-day inrationalised  industry is to  discharge the least efficient workers and to give moreregular employment to those retained in the service of the employer.     10.   The question of the desirability of short-time working is a very involvedone, and  I  feel that it would be dangerous  and might prejudice the position toattempt to deal with  it before the employers and employed in the industries mainly concerned have had an opportunity to give evidence to the Royal Commission. It isto be remembered that a statutory rule  directly penalising  short-timers  as such,under a precise definition, would probably lead to little immediate saving in benefit,because it would be  evaded.  The only result might be to influence  the employersdefinitely to discharge their workmen and re-engage them at short intervals, insteadof keeping them on their books and only working them when orders  justified it, orotherwise adjusting their arrangements to  meet the new rule.  It is further to beremembered  that short-time working has enabled Lancashire in particular to carryon over a long  period of exceptional  depression without real distress.     11.   The only rule which I can suggest as likely to be effective is  that, where an applicant for benefit  is an  intermittent worker, benefit may be  granted within the discretion of the Minister subject to the claimant proving hardship.     12.   As to the third special class mentioned in paragraph 5, viz.,ma\rried women,I have already furnished my colleagues, in CP. 240 (30), with the latest information available with  regard to the numbers, distribution (geographically and industrially),marital condition and ages of women claimants, and there is nothing  that I am ableto add at this date on these points.  The difficulty in dealing specially with marriedwomen as a class is that some industries, notably textiles, customarily employ them in large numbers.. This being  the case, 1 think there can be no doubt that contributionsmust be levied in respect of them.  Consequently, it  is very difficult to say that they: shall not be entitled  to benefit if they satisfy the same conditions as other insuredcontributors.  It is to be remembered, moreover, that it is the common habit in the textile trades in Lancashire for the women as well as  the men to work in the mills,even though married.  The family income consists of  the earnings, or of contributions from the earnings,  of all  the members of the family, including the mother and^daughters.   In these  circumstances, it is difficult to find a logical reason for refusing to  allow  the women,  including the married women, to draw benefit,  or to say thatsingle women may draw benefit while married women may not.     13.   A suggestion often made is that insured women on marriage should receive a refund of their past contributions (commonly called a dowry) and should not beentitled to benefit thereafter.  I have examined this  and am satisfied that it is not a practicable proposal.  It could not  be made compulsory; that  is to say,  it  could hardly be the  law that no married  woman could  ever  draw benefit.   On the other hand, if the scheme were voluntary,  the sum offered would be bound to be insufficient
[21811]to attract women likely to draw any appreciable amount of benefit.  The only womenlikely to take advantage of the dowry would be those who would not have claimedbenefit anyhow.  I pass over other difficulties,  e.g., what is to happen to the womanwho becomes a widow.                             .                          ; ,    14.  While, therefore, a dowry is impracticable, I think that it might be possibleto legislate on the lines  that benefit shall not be payable to a woman  after marriageuntil she has worked again for X weeks in an  insured trade, and  that even thenbenefit shall be limited to those who work in trades and in districts  where marriedwomen  are  customarily employed.  We might  add to this that, before allowingbenefit,  the Court of Referees must be satisfied that a  claimant  who has so workedsince marriage intends to obtain, and (having regard to the industrial circumstances in the district) can reasonably expect to obtain, employment in the district in which she is residing.    15.  Apart  from the special classes of workers dealt with in the preceding paragraphs,  there is the general question whether any additional conditions shouldbe applied by legislation to those claimants who are in receipt of transitional benefit in particular, should there be any  attempt to make the  grant  of such benefitdiscretionary ?  There is little doubt that transitional benefit is at present being paidto some persons  who, before  the Act of last March, were getting along without itand without  Poor Law relief.  It was pointed out in paragraph 7 of CP. 235 (30)that &quot; since last February the number of persons in receipt of  transitional benefithas increased from 140,000 to over 300,000;  of this increase, 50,000 have come fromthe Poor Law; the others are, for the most part, persons who were not in receiptof benefit or of  Poor Law  relief,  either because they  were disqualified or becausethey had not applied for it.  Thus, in transferring 50,000 persons  from the PoorLaw to State maintenance, a much, larger number, 110,000, have been attracted inaddition.&quot;    There is possibility of a  real saving being effected, and of what will commonlybe regarded as the remedying of abuses, by leaving it to Ministerial  discretion togrant benefit in those cases under the transitional provisions where hardship wouldbe created by withholding it.  It may  be urged,  however,  that such  a proposal is aretrograde step and that, having recently abolished discretion as part of the normalmachinery of insurance, it  should not be our policy to reintroduce it.    16.  To sum up  :     Subject to consideration  of reduced benefits  or increased contributions, I see no way of avoiding          (1) A  further  increase of   20,000,000 in the  borrowing  powers of  the              Unemployment  Fund, making a total of  80,000,000.         (2) A further  extension  of  &apos;&apos; transitional benefit &apos;&apos;  at heavy cost to  the              Exchequer.  -    We should probably set up immediately          (3)  A Royal  Commission  to review the whole field  of  unemployment               insurance and the other arrangements  for assisting  the able-bodied              unemployed.    Pending the report of the Royal Commission          (4) We must decide whether  to deal  at once  with alleged  &quot;abuses,&quot; and              specially with                    (a)  Seasonal Workers;                   (b)  Short-time Workers;                   (c) Married Women;                   (d)  Transitional benefit in cases where no  hardship  would be                            created by withholding it.

APPENDIX.  Proceedings of the Advisory Committee on Unemployment Insurance.PRESENT at these meetings were: Rt, Hon.  Margaret  G. Bondfield, M.P.,  Minister of Labour.Rt. Hon. A.  Greenwood, M.P., Minister  of Health.*Rt. Hon. Vernon  Hartshorn,  O.B.E.,  M.P., Lord Privy Seal.* mr .  E.  W. Pethick-Lawrence,  M.P.,  Financial Secretary to the Treasury.Sir  Henry  Betterton,  Bart.,   C.B.E.,  M.P.,Major W. E. Elliott, M.C., M.P.Mr. A. E. Brown, M.P.Mr. I. Foot, M.P.* Attended 1st and 3rd&apos; meetings.I Attended 3rd meeting only.               Conclusions of First Meeting held on July 28,. 1930.    1.  The Minister of Labour read the following agreed terms of reference ;          &quot;To.receive from the Government a statement showing an analysis of the    figures  of unemployment, and the financial payments from the Exchequer, and    to consider if it is possible to come to any agreement on the questions they raise.    This does not include  a wide  national policy such as would  necessitate  the    consideration of  matters like safeguarding  or any of the proposals dividing    parties.&quot;    She then described the problems with which the Advisory Committee would be faced.  She emphasised that if the transitional period was not extended for afurther year it would be essential to legislate before Christmas.  Consequently,  if,as she hoped, the Bill to be introduced was to be an agreed Bill, the time which theAdvisory Committee had to spend on the questions before them was, to this extent,limited.    2.  In the course of the discussion the following points emerged :     (a) Was it desirable that the transitional period should be  continued if any           practicable alternative could be found ?    (b) Would a scheme which merely brought transitional benefit to an end with-           out further provision leaving those who would have obtained transitional           benefit to seek relief from the local rates, receive the general assent of any           party in the House?    (c)  Whether the solution of the problem in these circumstances might not be in           the direction of an intermediate method of treatment which would involve           a charge on the Exchequer and  would make use of the Local Authorities           in. the. analysis and. treatment of individual cases,    3.  It was agreed that before further  progress could be made by the AdvisoryCommittee a closer analysis of the problem and of various  subsidiary questions was essential, and the Government representatives undertook to circulate to the AdvisoryCommittee as  early as possible memoranda, on the following points :      (a) An analysis,  by age groups, by sex, by geographical.1 distribution, and by           industrial occupations of those persons now claiming transitional benefit            the analysis to distinguish if practicable between those who might  be           regarded  as  normally   inside   and   those  outside  the  insurable           field respectively.
            Conclusions of Second Meeting held on September 8, 1930.Advisory Committee on Unemployment Insurance.    1.  The Committee approved the note of the  proceedings of the First Meeting(A.C.U.I.  (30) 1st Meeting).Second Meeting.  Note of Proceedings.    The Minister of Labour drew special attention to the  Prime Ministers  state-ment  on page 4 of the note.Analysis of Persons Claiming Transitional Benefit.   (A.C.U.I. 1 (30).)    2.   The Committee took note of the high percentage  of persons in receipt of transitional benefit classified as belonging to the  coal  mining industry; the low.percentage of men in the textile industries (no doubt due to the  system of short time working); and the high proportion of married  women in receipt of transitional.benefit in the North-Western and  Midlands  Divisions.    They noted that  11,800persons were shown as having paid less  than five  contributions during  the  period july, 1928, to May, 1930. Mr. Ernest Brown asked if a detailed classification couldbe given of the persons in this group.    (6)  A note on the Brynmawr and Tonypandy experiments in the employment of          men on voluntary work under  the control of a voluntary agency while          drawing Unemployment  Benefit the note to show the  extent to which          these experiments or similar experiments  have been successful, how and          in what manner it had been found practicable to employ men on work          which normally would not have been  work done for wages, and generally          the degree to which it was desirable and possible to require service as          a condition of the receipt of relief or benefit.    (c)  A note on the question whether the present conditions for the receipt of          Unemployment Benefit tended to prevent  claimants from looking for or          accepting employment of a temporary and/or non-insurable character,          for example, haymaking.    (d)  A  memorandum examining  the  various possible  types  of  intermediate          scheme for dealing with those now on transitional benefit this note to be          accompanied by a memorandum from the  Treasury on the finance of the          several  schemes, and a note  by the Minister of  Health on the attitude          which Local Authorities  would be likely to adopt.    4.  It was suggested that it might be advisable for the Advisory Committee tobe regarded as a Cabinet Committee or similar body, so that it  might have  theassistance of the Cabinet Secretariat while its proceedings would be secret.    5.  It  was agreed that the next meeting  of the Advisory Committee shouldtake place on the 8th September at 2-30 P.M., and that the following dates should be reserved for further  meetings of the Advisory  Committee:                9th September, 26th September and 27th September.    NOTE. The Prime Minister, in response to the  suggestion contained in para-graph 4, has defined  the status of the  Advisory  Committee as follows :          &quot; As part of the series of advisory consultations which are taking place on    subjects of an economic character, the  facts  and the meaning of the expenditure    on  unemployment in its more recent  features are being examined by  a  body,    upon which members of all parties sit, working under the conditions which    regulate committees of the Advisory Economic Council. I must make it clear once    more that these discussions are not conducted by  Government Committees whose    work is to prepare Government policy,  but are conducted so as to put the Govern-    ment in  possession of  different  points  of  view  authoritatively  stated.     &quot; Hansard,&quot; Vol. 242, No. 187, July 30, 1930,  Col. 493.
The Brynmawr and Tonypandy Experiments.  (A.C.U.I. 2 (30).)    3.  The  Committee took note of the memorandum circulated  by the Ministercontaining a report of the experiments at Brynmawr  and Tonypandy, setting upvoluntary labour schemes.   They noted with regret that little had been done  inconnection with the schemes, and they agreed that although voluntary schemes shouldnot be discouraged, the matter could  not  be  pursued further in  relation to this examination.The  Effect  of  the  Benefit Conditions  on  the  Talcing  of Temporary  Work.         (A.C.U.I. 3 (30).)    4.  The  Committee postponed consideration of this memorandum until further progress had been made with the general question.    5.  Without expressing final views, the Committee  made a general survey of thepossible  lines of action in  regard to the Unemployment  Insurance Scheme andTransitional  Benefit.  The main points of the discussion were as follows :--Proposals for dealing with Transitional Benefit Class.  (A.C.U.I. 4 (30).)    6.  The  Committee were in agreement that it was of first importance to  restore the prestige of the Unemployment Insurance scheme and to take  steps to make itself-supporting.   It was important also that the general  public should distinguish between  real  insurance and  other forms of relief.  At present the distinction washard to make except to the expert and on technical  grounds.  Outside the unemploy-ment insurance scheme individual examination was necessary to determine what wereindividual needs  as regards maintenance and  remedial treatment.    A flat rate  of payment was quite unsuitable and  &quot;individual examination&quot; should include a test of means.    7.  The  Committee discussed the extent to which the Unemployment Fund was at present called  upon to bear certain charges  which  were never intended to  be put upon  it when the scheme was framed.   These  included regular short time working-over an  extended period of time  and methods  of arranging work  so as to takeadvantage of the continuity rules.  The Minister of Labour  agreed that these were serious questions which would have to be watched; at  the same time it was necessaryto weigh up the relative advantages  of  short time  working against permanentunemployment before making any drastic change.    8.  Unemployment Insurance. The Committee recognised that there were good reasons for not raising contributions and not reducing benefits.   The only other alternative was to vary the conditions so as to limit the number of persons who couldqualify for ordinary benefit.  In order that they might examine the possibilities  inthis direction, the Committee asked that they  might  have information for the next meeting to show the effect on the numbers in receipt of  unemployment benefit of thefollowing proposals :     (a) The  amendment of the continuity rules whereby benefit would be paid only           in respect of six consecutive days of unemployment.    (b) A first statutory condition requiring 35, 40, 45,  50, &amp;o, contributions to have           been paid in the last two years.    (c) What ratio of benefit to contributions would reduce the number in receipt  of           benefit to a balancing point of 1,200,000 persons.    For the purpose of this information the fact that the Unemployment Fund is  indebt should be ignored.    9.  The  Transitional Benefit Class. The Committee realised that this was a problem mainly of the depressed areas.  The class included many persons who wereinefficient and who were not likely to  be re-employed in industry, but had retained an industrial classification.  As pointed out in CP. 235 (30), there was little to  choose between them, and, on the one hand, many of  the persons in more prosperous areaswho had thirty contributions, and, on the other, uninsured persons.    10.  The Minister  of Health suggested that  in any  event  Public assistance authorities would not be in a position to administer  a  scheme  dealing with personsnow in receipt of transitional benefit for at least two years, and it  was not possible
to transfer persons in this class to the Public Assistance Authorities as the LocalAuthorities were fully occupied with the reform of the local government.    11.  As regards finance, the Minister of Health said that Local Authorities had for a long time pressed that the relief of the unemployed should be a national charge,and any  suggestion  that  they  should resume  financial responsibility for thosetransferred from the Poor Law by reason of the 1930 Act, as well as a considerablenumber in addition, would meet with the strongest resistance.  It was axiomaticthat administration by a local body without a considerable measure of local financial responsibility was a dangerous expedient.  Major Elliot agreed with the  Minister ofHealth in these  general conclusions, in the light of his experience at the  scottish office.    12.  The  Committee were, therefore,  thrown back upon the proposal  that the transitional benefit class should  be provided for by a scheme intermediate  betweenUnemployment Insurance and the Poor Law, which  would be subject to central control, but which would at the same time provide for individual  examination of the claimants needs,  both as regards maintenance and  remedial treatment.  they thought that  it  might  be  possible for such a scheme to be administered by theEmployment Exchanges with  the assistance of the Investigation Staff of the localAuthorities.   The  machinery for  deciding claims and rates  of  payment must,however, be quite  distinct from the machinery  for  determining claims for benefit under  the insurance  scheme.  Major Elliot suggested that the machinery  mightconsist of a local body on which employers, workers, public men, the Local authority and the Employment Exchange were represented.    13.  The  Minister  of Health  reminded the Committee  that any  decision theymight  take would  have far-reaching results.  He  doubted if the public mind  wasproperbr prepared  for  the acceptance of  a scheme of this kind, or whether theCommittee would be justified in advancing these proposals without more considera-tion than they could  afford themselves to give,  and without hearing the views of outside interests.  He thought that a more formal enquiry. possibly in the form ofa Royal Commission which could take evidence in public and survey the whole field of unemployment insurance and other forms of relief might be set up and requiredto report  by a certain date.  Pending their report,  Parliament  might be asked tocontinue the existing arrangements on a temporary basis.    In reply to Sir Henry Betterton, the Minister of Health undertook  to circulate a note to the Committee explaining his proposal.    14.  Major  Elliot said that, while he had no  objection to  the fullest possibleenquiry by a Royal Commission, he felt that it was undesirable to ask  parliament for further  borrowing powers for the Fund and for a supplementary  estimate inrespect of transitional benefit,  without making some change in the existing arrange-ments.  He  thought that the legislation to be introduced next session should makethe Fund self-supporting,  and clearly distinguish the transitional benefit class fromthe insurance scheme.  There would then be a clear-cut problem to consider.  Publicopinion might not tolerate a continuation  of the present  anomalies and  an increaseof the deficit on  the Fund. Mr. Foot  agreed that the Committee must put  forwardsome  proposals  to  deal with  the  problem in addition to  a reference  to  a  RoyalCommission.    15.   The  Committee agreed to meet again at 10-30 A.M. on the 26th September.In view of the financial considerations involved, they decided to invite the FinancialSecretary to the  Treasury to attend the next meeting.  In the meantime the Ministerof  Labour undertook  to examine Departmentally  the practicability of an inter-mediate scheme on the lines discussed and to circulate  a note to  the members beforethe meeting, together with the other material desired.            Conchisions of Third  Meeting held  on September 26, 1930.    It was agreed to substitute for  the  words &quot;The Committee  agreed,&quot;  at thebeginning of paragraph 10 of the Conclusions of the Second Meeting, &quot; The  Ministerof Health suggested.&quot;    Attention was called to notices which had appeared in  the Press  purporting toreport the  proceedings of the Committee.   It was  suggested that  it might be advisable to issue to the Press after each meeting a brief official account of what had
taken place at such meeting.  It was, however, finally agreed that no statements atall should be made, either by members of the Committee or by the Cabinet Secre-tariat, or by the Ministry of Labour, or anyone else.     The Memorandum A.C.U.I.7 (30) &quot;Suggested Intermediate Scheme&quot;-was read out by the Minister  of Labour and a  general discussion  followed.   It was generally agreed that it was necessary to have a thorough review of the arrange-ments  for assisting the able-bodied unemployed and that this should probably bedone by means of a Royal Commission.  The immediate question, however, was,what is to be done pending such a Commission^ Report ?  The Committee exploredthree suggestions for dealing with this.  One suggestion,  which was supported bythe Ministers  of Labour and Health and the Lord Privy Seal,  was that,  pendingthe Report  of the Royal Commission (which should be asked to report  within sixmonths or a year), there should be any necessary borrowing Bill  for the  Unemploy-ment Fund  and a  simple prolongation of the transitional conditions.  The secondsuggestion,  which was pressed by Sir Henry Betterton and Major Elliot, was that,while the transitional period should be extended and there should be any necessaryborrowing,  any Bill to effect this should be accompanied  by provisions aiming at(1) reducing the numbers on  the Unemployment  Fund  to  balancing  point andtransferring the balance to the  Exchequer, (2) remedying minor abuses, both of theUnemployment Insurance Scheme proper and of the transitional provisions, and(3) making quite  clear the distinction  between  unemployment  insurance  andtransitional benefit.  The third  suggestion, which was made by Mr.  Foot, was that,m yoing to  the House for further borrowing  powers, while the Government shouldnot make any other changes in the scheme, pending  the proposed enquiry, it shouldcommit itself definitely to  the policy of making the Unemployment Fund balanceon  the present live register.  The Minister of Health  added that it should alsocommit itself to the policy of providing  for those who would be cut off by any suchbalancing.     It was finally agreed that the three Parties should separate in order to discussthe matter with their colleagues and&apos; should meet again at  10-30  A.M. on Thursday,the 23rd October.     The Minister of Labour promised to try to let  the Committee have  at its next meeting  a  return  dealing with  seasonal workers  and also a  note  giving  what information the Department had as  to the truth about the allegation that it isimpossible, owing to the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, to  get labour for theharvesting.  In addition,  Major  Elliot  asked for estimates as to the effect of adjusting rates of  benefit to the cost of living, and Sir Henry Betterton asked that the previous memoranda with regard to a change in the rule about contributionsmight be re-examined to see whether the basis upon  which they had been drawn upwas one relating to a rather exceptional period and, if so, whether a more normalperiod could be taken.o
