OPET. 7331(30)IS  iinpn?.!-^&apos;  vs THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.                                                                40                                 OABINET.           CoPy No&apos;-,-               Dyestuffs  (Import Regulation) Aot,  1920.         memorandum by  the President  of  the Board  of Trade.         1.  My colleagues  will remember that in July last,  I circulated      a memorandum  (O.P.  238(30)) summarising tho Report  of the      Dyestuffs Industry Development Committee  on the progress and      present position of  that industry.         The Committee  made  no  recommendation  as to the  continuance or      otherwise after  the  15th January next  of  the  Dyestuffs  (Import      Regulation) Act, 1920,  by  which  all synthetic organic dyestuffs      and intermediates  used  in  the  manufacture thereof are prohibited      from being  imported except under licence  from the Board  of Trade      advised by  a  committee  consisting of representatives of  the  colour-      making and  colour-using industriesendaf independent members.  The      Committee,  however,  concluded their report with the following      paragraph:           Consequently it  is  to the  interest  of all parties           Concerned, that  is  the  Government,  the  Users  and  the           &quot;dyestuff manufacturers  to  continue  to consider the           &quot;problem In the same  spirit of oo-operation  that has           &quot;marked the period of the operation of the Dyestuffs           &apos;Aot and together to  agree, if possible, first whether           *any further assistance to  the industry  is necessary,           &apos;and,  if so,  as to the form which it should  take&apos;.         2. In accordance with the suggestion made  In par.14 (b) of my      memorandum 0.P.238(30), and approved by my oolle&amp;colleagues,  I convened      a small informal conference of representative Colour Users (all of      them members of the Council of the  Colour Users&apos;  Association,
.a  body representative of a  large proportion of  the  concerns&apos; engaged  in the  dyeing,  calico  printing, paint making and  other dye-using   trades)  and  of representatives  of the three principal  British-owned companies  engaged  in the dye-making industry,    I have  now  received a  report  (of which  a  copy is annexed  to this memorandum)  from the  Chairman of that  conference showing  that no agreement was  reached, and that the user representatives felt themselves bound by  a published resolution of the  council  of their Association adverse to  the  continuance of the Act, and were not disposed  to  express any opinion  as to the  need or otherwise of any form  of  special assistance to the dye-making industry.    The  dye-makers, on the other hand, did make the important  proposal that the  Dyestuffs  (Import Regulation) Act,  1920 should be  continued for a term  of years, but  subject to  the  condition that  licences for  importation would be granted  If British makers were unable  to  supply  the dyestuffs required  (or  adequate equivalents for them)  or  would not  supply them at  the  prices  quoted  by foreign manufacturers, so long as such prices  were not  dumping&apos;  prices.   They proposed that the licensing system should continue as  at present - it is generally  agreed that in  recent years  it  has operated very smoothly  - in order  to  provide a  safeguard  against an attack upon the  British Industry by systematic  &quot;dumping1, and also as a means of  securing to the makers that constant information as to the  needs of British users which the present system has furnished.    3. The Act is  due to expire on the 15th January next,  and, therefore, the question of whether it shall be  continued, with or without modification, is one  which needs to  be  decided at an early date.    I stated in reply  to a  Parliamentary Question on the 30th July last that the Governments policy in the matter would be  announced very soon after Parliament  re-assembled.                               -2-
I do not think that in any declarations as to economic policymade on &quot;behalf of the Government there has been-any specific reference to the Dyestuffs prohibition and there is nothing inthe International Convention relating to Prohibitions or in theTariff Truce Agreement which would prevent the prohibitionbeing renewed after Its expiry in January next.   4, The position is that the output of synthetic dyestuffsin the united Kingdom has increased from 9,1 million lbs. (made very largely from imported intermediates) in 1913 to 51 millionlbs. in 1928 and 55 millions In 1929 (made almost entirely from home-produced intermsdiates),   The imports, which amounted to52.6 million lbs. in 1913, declined to 3.9 millions In 1928 andto 4.1 millions in 1929.   Despite the wide reputation and long-established connexions of the German and Swiss industries andthe large developments of the industry in the United States and elsewhere, the exports of British-made dyestuffs are now making good progress, and amounted in 1928 to 10,378,592 lbs., and in1929 to 15,244,544 lbs.   Approximately 90 per cent, by quantityof the dyestuffs used in the Itoited Kingdom are of homemanufacture j  In value the proportion is somewhat lower, about80 per  oent., owing to the fact that certain ranges of coloursnot at present produced in this country are more highly pricedthan those ranges which are so produced.     It is of some ,significance as to the future that of thetotal production of dyestuffs In the United Kingdom in 1928 the share of  Imperial  Chemical Industries, Ltd. was 44 per cent,, andthat of the Clayton Aniline Company, Ltd, (which is entirelycontrolled by Swiss interests, though Its management, and scientific, technical and labour staffs are practically whollyBritish)  was 17 per  cent.   Two other British concernsaccounted for over 10 per cant, each:  the remaining output was.spread  over fourteen other concerns, mostly dealing inspecialities and having particular clienteles.
   5. As regards the quality of this output there is generalagreement that there is little room for criticism, and thatthe position as to shade, fastness and physical conditions ofthe dyestuffs produced by the British makers, and as touniformity of deliveries ( a factor of great importance tocolour users, especially in the textile trades) is quitesatisfactory:  it is also generally agreed that during recentyears there has been a very marked improvement in the &quot;service&quot;given by the makers to the users, and in the amount of technical co-operation between them.     As regards the range, of output, the main criticismsdirected against the British makers are first that they have concentrated attention unduly on the classes of dyestuffs forwhich there is a comparatively large demand, with the resultthat they have failed to meet the needs of some branches ofthe textile trade which depend to a great extent upon thenovelty of the effects produced, and therefore upon dyestuffspecialities;  and second, that they have devoted their effortsrather to the provision of substitutes for existing classesof dyestuffs produced elsewhere than to the production ofentirely new colours - that is, they have been imitative andnot original.   The first of these  criticisms is undoubtedlytrue, but the policy against which it is directed was regarded by the makers as the only practicable one having regard to the peculiar difficulties in building up this particular Industry,and it is now losing much of its forcej  and the secondcriticism is subject to the modifications (to which theDevelopment  Committee draw attention) that it was the Britishdye-making industry which solved the very difficult problem ofcolouring cellulose acetate silk (a discovery of very greatimportance to the artificial silk industry) and that the prosecution  of  research by the larger British  companies is now proceeding on sound and adequate lines,                             -4-
     As regards price,, it is generally agreed that in theearlier years of the operation of the Act a heavy burden was laid upon the colour-using trades in consequence of thedifference between British and continental prices, but it  isalso agreed that the margin has steadily become narrower and inrespect of a very large range of dyestuffs has alreadydisappeared, and the proposal now made by the British makerswould eliminate it entirely.   6. In the circumstances described in the two precedingsections, it may be held that the purpose of the Dyestuffs(Import Regulation) Act has been accomplished, and that theindustry has reached a stage of development in which It doesnot need any extraneous help, and should be left to meet foreigncompetition with its own resources.   This is the view taken bya considerable body of consumers, though not by all;  andexception is also taken by some of them to a continuance of thepresent system on the grounds that (a) their inability to  place orders for substantial quantities of some classes of foreign -chiefly German-dyes has the result that they have to pay higher prices for such dyes as they are allowed to import, and (b) therestrictions of the licensing system prevent them from havingthat quick access to new colours which is essential for a trade which depends largely on the rapidity with which it  meets,and even stimulates,  changes in fashion.   The  degree to which british dye-users have actually experienced the first nameddifficulty is  Impossible to determine - it has probably operatedto some extent, and there is no doubt that the German makershavo frequently kept up prices at a very high level untilcompetitive British products came upon the market.   As regardsthe second point, It has been publicly asserted by one important British  colour user that his experience has been tothe  contrary,  and that the licensing system has not restrictedhis access to  new  colours.   The German makers have, it Is
well known, been anxious to keep their hold upon the UnitedKingdom market as much as possible;  and they have been able todo this only by pushing their trade in specialities.   On thewhole there does not appear to be strong evidence that Britishcolour users have recently been seriously hampered in thisrespect.   7, The makers of dyestuffs think that in the absence of anyprohibition there may be a systematic attack, particularly bythe German makers, on the United Kingdom by means of &quot;dumping&quot;prices, and also that the German makers may force British usersto obtain from them supplies of dyes which are made here by the threat to withhold supplies of dyes required but not so made.This latter fear is probably exaggerated?  the former oneindicates a possibility, in view of the still very strong position of the German industry, but I do not think it can beput higher than that.     The British makers also declare that tho cessation ofprotection will seriously check the expansion of productionin this  country and may even reduce production.   Thus in thecaso of  the Clayton Aniline  Go, where the capital is Swiss,there are known to be schemes of expansion dependent on theGovernments decision as to  the  continuance or otherwise of theAct,   The makers  claim that their record of recent years doesnot warrant any suggestion that a  continuance of the Act wouldresult in any lack of effort on their part.     In  this  connexion I am bound to point out that it is very probable that the  expiry of  the Act will be followed at nodistant  date by a marketing  (and it may be also a production)agreement at  least between the  Interessen-Gemeinschaft (the combination of German manufacturers) and the largest (andpossibly others) of the British producers - an agreementhastened by the desire of the lattor to avoid a price war,
As there are already arrangements between the Intereasen-Gemeinschaft and the combination of Swiss producers, and also theFrench, the result would be to put an end to that competition towhich British colour users attach so great importance.   ABritish-German combination is possible, and indeed  I thinklikely, in any event;  but the continuance of some form ofprotection for tho British industry would probably have theresult that some of the British makers would be able to resistbeing forced into such a combine, and that those whd did go into it would be in a better bargaining position than would otherwise be the case.   Q0 There are two other  considerations to which I should alsodirect my colleagues&apos; attention,     (i) At the recent meeting of the British Association for tho          Advancement of Science and on other occasions during          the past decade  stress has been laid by a number of          distinguished  chemists on the great and growing          importance of  the study of organic chemistry and of its          practical, applications, and on the value  of the          dyestuffs Industry as providing one of the  chief fields          for the employment of organic chemists, both in          research and productions   Of that particular  class          of scientific  workers the  country found Itself very          seriously short  in 1914-1918, and there is  no doubt          that the development of the dyestuffs and connected          industries has given a great stimulus to  the  Chemical          Departments  of our Universities and technical  colleges.      (.ii)  In par, 13 of  my previous memorandum  (CP.  238/30) I          drew attention to  the reference made  in the Report of .          the Development  Committee to the importance of the          Cyestuffa industry in respoct of national defence, and          to the  intimation  given to me by the  Secretary of State          for War as to  the  opinion  of his scientific advisers
on this matter.   9. There are three possible courses of action:     (a) to allow the prohibition to lapse in January next;     (b) to continue the existing prohibition by means of  the          Expiring Laws Continuance Act, a course  to  which I am          advised there is no technical objection, though  it          has the disadvantage that it would not give to the          industry anything more than an assurance of a short          period of security, and that both makers and users          would be placed a year hence in the same position of          uncertainty that they are in to-dayj and     (o) to renew the Act for a period, say, three years.     If either the second or third course be adopted, the  existing machinery could be continued, and in view of the  statutorycomposition of the Committee and the way in which  the Act  has been administered under successive Governments the question arises whether it would, be necessary to impose any statutory conditionsas to the conditions governing the grant of licences.   Thiswould require further consideration.W.G.Board of Trade.
                                                 ANNEXE.                 REPORT OF INFORMAL CONFERENCE.To the Rt.  Hon.  William Graham,  P.O.,  M.P.,          President of the Board of Trade.Sir,     1. The members of the Conference of Representatives ofthe Colour Making and Colour Using Industries convened hy you in accordance with the suggestion made in paragraph 113 ofthe Report of the Dyestuffs Industry Development Committee met in London on the 30th July, 1930, and again in Manchester onthe 18th September, 1930.     2, The paragraph in the Report mentioned above is asfollows: -     &quot;Consequently it is in the interest of all parties       concerned, that is the Government, the Users and the       Dyestuff Manufacturers, to continue to consider the       problem in the same spirit of co-operation that has       marked the period of the operation of the Dyestuffs       Act, and together to agree, if possible, first whether       any further assistance to the industry is necessary,       and, if so, as to the form which such assistance       should take&quot;,     3, The members of the Conference were as follows:-       Mr. B. Carr Deakin (Bleachers&apos; Assocn. Ltd. )       Major L.B. Holliday (L.B. Holliday &amp; Co. Ltd.)       Mr, C.G. Railton (Calico Printers&apos; Assocn. Ltd.)       Mr. J. Rogers (British Dyestuffs Corporation Ltd.)       Sir Henry Sutcliffe-Smith (Chairman of the Colour                                 Users&apos; Association.)       Mr. C.\V. Wade (Leeds and District Worsted Dyers                                 and Finishers&apos; Assocn. Ltd.)       Mr. T.M. willcox (British Alizarine Co. Ltd.)       Mr. W.J.U. Woolcock, C.B.S., (Chairman, Dyestuffs                       Industry  Development Committee).                            -9-
(Mr. Deakin was unable to attend the first meeting and was represented by Mr* Schwabe Parker).     Mr. Percy Ashley, O.B.,  of the Board of Trade was also present at our meetings.     4. At the first meeting after you had welcomed the membersof the Conference I took the Chair at your request.   At thecommencement of the second meeting) held on the ISth September,Sir Henry Sutcliffe-Smith stated that at a recent meeting cf the colour Users1 Association the opinion was expressed that theChairman of this Conference should &apos;be a neutral person, and  not one connected in any way with either the Colour Users or ColourMakers.   I said that I understood that you had requested me toact as Chairman because of my Chairmanship of the development committee.   I would, however,  report to you the opinion of  the colour Users but in the meantime I had no alternative but to occupy the Chair until I received further instructions from you.     5. I regret now to have to report that it has proved impossible to arrive at any agreement whether any further assistanceto the industry is necessary, and, secondly, any form of futureco-operation between the interests concerned.     6. The discussion naturally turned mainly upon the questionwhether the Dyestuffs (Import Regulrtion) Act which is due to expire on the 15th January next should be allowed to lapse or should be continued with or without modification.     The position taken up by the Dye Makers is that despite theprogress made by the industry during the past decade as shown inthe report of the Development Committee there is need for a continuance of the Act, for somo period to be agreed, so as  to
enable the industry to consolidate the ground already won and I                                                              Ito make further progress.    They think that if no further assistance is given the -possibility of continued progress will be seriously imperilled and, indeed,  that some of theground already r won may be lost and that this would be unfortunate not only from the industrial standpoint but inrelation to even- wider national interests.     The attitude of the Representatives of the ColourUsers is that the Act was passed for a period of 10 yearsand no longer;  that such a period should be ample for theestablishment of any industry;  and that if any further assistance is required by the industry - a  matter on whichthey are not prepared to commit themselves  to the expression of any opinion - it should not take the form of a continuanceof the Act, or any form which would be in any way a burdento the Colour Using Industries or penalise  them to anyoxtent whatsoever.     7. The Dye Makers indicated that if the Dyestuffs(import Regulation) ^.ct were continued they would agreeto the abolition of the price factor arrangement referred toin paragraph 75 of the Report of tho Dyectuffs industry development Committee, and to the grant of  licences forimportation if British Makers could either  not supply the dyestuffs required (or adequate equivalents thereof)  at all or would not supply them at the prices quoted by foreignmanufacturers so long as such prices were not dumping prices.In the Dye Makers&apos;  viov; this removed every  substantialdisadvantage under which the Colour Users might have laboured.They desired a continuance of the Act subject to this condition in order in the xirst place to ensure that the pricesquoted by foreign suppliers were not dumping prices and,
secontlly to secure the constant information as to the needsof the British market -which has been provided by the presentsystem.   The manufacturers think that experience of theworking of the Act has shown that it is not possible to devise a more satisfactory form of assistance and they,therefore, think that the existing machinery represented bythe Dyestuffs Advisory Licensing Committee, which has worked in close co-operation with the organisations of Colour Makersand Colour Users, should be continued.     8. The Colour Users stated that despite the concessionoffered by the manufacturers their objection to thecontinuance of the Act remained.     It was suggested by the Colour Users that the pricequoted by foreign (and especially German) manufacturerscovered some services not given by British manufacturers andthat? consequently, equality of price was not sufficient.The only specific illustration given was that of the so-called&quot;Indanthrene Campaign&quot; which is described in paragraph 108of the Report of the Development Committee.   The ColourMakers pointed out that whilst they were prepared to co-operat&amp;with the Users in propaganda relating to British textiles andBritish made dyes, action on the line of the German campaignwould be very difficult owing to the number of marks (some ofthem dyers&apos; and printers&apos; marks) under which British textilegoods are sold and to some of which a large goodwill attaches.They offered to consider any practicable proposal which,having regard to these conditions, the Colour Users might putforward; but the latter were apparently not in a position to pursue the suggestion.     9. Sir Henry&apos; Sutclif fe-Srai th renewed the suggestion madein his address at the 11th Annual General Meeting of the
Colour Users&apos;  Association held on the 15th July,  1930,  namely,that the provisions of the existing Act should he continuedhut only in respect of those dyestuffs of which the BritishMakers have definitely established the manufacture in thiscountry by the date on which the Act is at present due to expire and which have been agreed upon by Makers and Users  asdefinitely equivalent to the best corresponding productionsmade abroad.    All other dyestuffs both new and improvementson existing types should be allowed free entry;  even as regardsthe dyestuffs on the Protected List licences on importationwould be granted unless the British Makers were prepared tomeet foreign prices, except where those prices were dumpingprices.   Sir Henry is of opinion that such a scheme would  offeradequate protection to the British Makers by giving them a protection in respect of &quot;a minimum of 80% of their products&quot;and &quot;would give them that security and confidence which wouldenable them to go forward in the exploration and developmentof newer and better products, and at the same time the BritishUser would not be handicapped in any way as compared with hisforeign competitor in having the fullest access to the world&apos;latest developments&quot;.   Sir Henry Sutcliffe-Smith made it clearthat he put this proposal forward in his personal capacity and as the representative of one very large dye-using company,and not as Chairman of the Colour Users&apos; Association.   It  didnot, however, commend itself to his colleagues at the Conferenceand, consequently, it was not pursued.     10. One other matter referred to was the possibility ofState assistance in respect of the organisation and developmentof research.   The Colour Makers did not ask for any assistance of this kind, and though some indefinite suggestions as to the adequacy of their research work were made, in reply
      to which Mr.  Rogers of the British Dyestuffs Corporation      offered to give the Colour Users opportunity to acquaint      themselves in detail with the research work being carried on      by that Company,  the matter dropped after a statement by      Sir Henry Sutcliffe-Smith that the Technical Advisers of the      Bradford Dyers&apos; Association Limited were quite  satisfied with      the research organisation and work of the corporation.           11.  Finally  it was stated on behalf of the Colour Users      that in their opinion the question whether any  further      assistance should be afforded to the Dyestuffs  Industry  was a      -matter solely for the decision of the Government.    If the      decision was that after the expiry of the  Dyestuffs Act      nothing further should be done in the way of affording      assistance to the industry there was no need for the interests      concerned to consider the matter further.    If,  on the other      hand,  it should be decided to continue any form of assistance  v      to the industry the Users would then be quite willing to      continue to co-operate with the Makers and the Government in      the same spirit as in the past.           12.  Throughout the discussions it was apparent that,      whatever their individual opinions might bo,  the representatives-      of the Colour Users regarded themselves as precluded by  the      Resolution recently passed by the Council of the Colour  Users      Association from  doing anything more than reiterating their      opposition to the continuance of the Act.    In  these circumstances      the Conference broke up,  and I feel bound to inform you  that      in my judgment a  renewal of discussion on the present basis      would not serve any useful purpose.           I have the honour to be                          Sir,                             Your obedient servant,Abbey House,                    (Signed)  V/.J. U.  Y/OOLCOCK.   Westminster, S,?,l,      18th September,  1930.
