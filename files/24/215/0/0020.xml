THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.    305Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1930.SECRET.                                                     Cojtf No.  4QCP.  320 (30).CABINET.PROPOSED  FIJI-NEW ZEALAND  TRADE  AGREEMENT.          MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.    I CIRCULATE herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a memorandum which I have had prepared on the subject of a proposed Fiji-New Zealand trade agreement.                                                         (Initialled)      P.    Colonial Office, September 26, 1930.                              MEMORANDUM.                PROPOSED FIJI-NEW ZEALAND TRADE AGREEMENT.     1.  A Trade Agreement  between  Fiji and New  Zealand  has been  underconsideration for some years, and in 1929 the Government of Fiji, submitted proposals under  which New Zealand would guarantee to continue to  admit Fiji bananas,pineapples and other fruits free  of duty, while Fiji would (a) reduce the rates on certain classes of  goods imported  from New Zealand below  the existing BritishPreferential rates*;  and (&amp;) impose duties on certain other classes of goods imported from other places (including other parts of the  British Empire), but not on such imports from New Zealand.  As submitted, these proposals involved discrimination against the United Kingdom, and the Governor was informed  that the Secretary ofState for the Colonies  could only approve them  provided the proposed  specialpreference in respect of  the  specified  goods  imported into Fiji in  favour ofNew Zealand was extended to the United Kingdom and any other part of the empire which gives the same facilities as New Zealand to Fiji produce.    2.  The  Colonial Government have now intimated  that  the extension of thepreference to other parts of the Empire would involve a  loss of  Revenue which theColony is not at present able to face, and have suggested that the quid pro  quo whichthe Colony must offer to New Zealand in order  to obtain the  desired guarantee of continued favourable treatment should take the form of the restriction of the benefits of the  whole of the Fiji  preferential tariff to New Zealand and those parts of theEmpire which gave  Fiji products the same facilities as New Zealand.  In effect,this  would not merely place Australia at a disadvantage in respect of the limitedclass of goods concerned  in the original proposals, but would exclude her from thebenefits of the Fiji Preferential tariff, which applies to practically all imports, and,.for the reason mentioned below, would correspondingly benefit New Zealand.  , * The Fiji Customs Tariff provides for preferential rates for imports from other parts of the Empire forpractically all classes of goods.[21747]
    3.  For the supply to Fiji of many kinds of goods  there is keen competition between Australia and New Zealand, which are the natural sources of supply. Thereis no doubt that for some time past Fiji produce has received much more favourable treatment in New Zealand than in Australia, whence the two principal products ofFiji are in effect excluded sugar by actual embargo and bananas by a prohibitiveduty.   The figures of  the trade of Fiji  with the principal countries concerned, in1928,  are  as follows :                               Imports.       Exports.                                                 Australia       ......      621,784          50,422New Zealand    ......      140,697         590,246United Kingdom        ...      404,718         385,220Canada         ......       70,262       1,244,082USA          ...       ...      131,994          53,232Other countries......      113,724         378,0491,483,169       2,701,251     The &quot;unfavourable balance &quot; of trade with Australia is striking, and has long been the subject of feeling in the Colony.     4.  Nevertheless, the proposed total exclusion of Australia from the benefits ofthe Fiji preferential tariff is a drastic measure.  It is a declaration of economic war,and, however  much justification there may be for considering Australia to be theoriginal aggressor,  Australian opinion, already sensitive on such matters,  is likely to regard it as inspired by this country.     5.  A less drastic  measure, which might give New Zealand the benefits of theoriginal proposals while not so violently antagonising Australia or involving the lossof any revenue by Fij i, would be for the Colony to raise the British preferential rate(or impose such a rate where it did not exist) on the classes of goods intended  to be covered by the agreement, while continuing to admit such goods from New Zealand(and other parts  of the Empire  which grant equal facilities to Fiji produce) at theexisting rates, or free of duty, as the case might be.     6.  Even this, however, involves a  definite discrimination against  Australia.Precedent  exists  for the exclusion of parts of the  Empire from the benefits of a colonial preferential tariff, e.g., in Mauritius only the United Kingdom and Canadaenjoy the benefits of the preferential tariff under the Ordinance,  but those benefitsmay  be  extended  by   proclamation to such  British possessions as  may  grantreciprocity.  Jamaica is another example of a Colony which does not give the benefits of  the preferential rates of  duty to all parts  of  the Empire.    As regards theDominions, Canada, Australia and the Union of South  Africa  furnish similarexamples, and, while the Canadian preference is extended to nearly all parts of theEmpire, the preference in Australia and the Union  is much more  strictly limited.     7.  The question of the applicability of preferential tariffs is, however, becomingof  wide  importance, e.g., in connection with  the  proposed  Canada-West IndiesTrade Agreement,  about which  a separate memorandum has been submitted to theCabinet---C.P. 302 (30) and  it  is felt that  this  proposed Fiji-New Zealandagreement must be considered in the light of these wider considerations.  The revisedFiji proposals do not admittedly involve discrimination against  the United Kingdom,and it is submitted that, in view of  the precedents, it may be difficult to resist theproposals of the Fiji Government.     8.  Secondly, if the principle of discrimination against individual parts of theEmpire is conceded, it has to be  asked whether it is desirable and opportune for Fijito discriminate, either on the scale suggested by the Colonial Government or on the restricted scale suggested in paragraph 5, against Australia.   It  is submitted  that,in  all the  circumstances, and particularly having regard to the treatment of Fijiproduce by New Zealand and Australia respectively,  discrimination on the restrictedscale is justified.
    9.  I understand, however, that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsfeels that the announcement of a decision of this kind on the eve of or during theImperial Conference and without affording any opportunity to the  commonwealth government to  consider the position would be impolitic, and that the President ofthe Board of  Trade  considers that any policy  involving discrimination between different parts of the Empire is open to objection, and that so far as possible such apolicy should be discouraged.  I should propose, therefore, to  defer  a final decision until  after  the Imperial  Conference, and to take  the opportunity  afforded  bythe Conference for  discussing  the  situation  with  the representatives  of  theCommonwealth  Government.
