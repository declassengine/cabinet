    [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]                    Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1930SECRET.CP. 321 (30).                      CABINET.            INDIA:  THE  NORTH-WEST  FRONTIER.Measures  proposed by the Government of India for dealing with                               the Afridis.      MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR INDIA.   I  am  circulating a memorandum,  explaining the  circumstances  in which  theGovernment of India propose to send a force bej-oud the administrative border  of  thePeshawar District on .15th October.   The plan is to send troops into a small  section of the Kajuri  Plain to cover  theconstruction  of  certain roads and  to occupy positions  to protect those roads andfurther to forbid access to the Plain to offending sections of the Afridi Tribe.  Thereis no proposal to take any  offensive  action  in  a military  sense, e.g.  burning ofvillages, nor  would the  Plain  become a  British Administration in  the way   of collection of taxes or subjection to  the law of British India or  to  British-Indianpersonnel.   The reasons given for the proposal are :      (1) to enable the Government forces to protect the Peshawar District  from such         attacks as haye been made twice this year;    (2) to inflict economic punishment on the Afridis, or sections of them, by denying         them access to the Plains, into  which they usually move in the winter;    (3) to demonstrate the military  power  of the  Government and to restore  its         prestige by the  operations themselves and  by the infliction  of  punishment         upon any Afridi tribesmen who may attempt to interfere with them.   Criticisms of this action may take any of the following forms :     (i) That it imposes a charge amounting probably to nearly  200.000  upon Indian         taxpayers.   It  must be remembered, in this  connection, that the  Indian         Military Budget is contracted for at Rs. 54  crores (nearly  41 millions),         which calculation may cover this or similar operations ; doubt exists on  this         point.     (ii) That we are invading the Afridi country and seizing their  territory.  In  one         sense this is true.  We are proposing to deprive certain sections temporarily         of what  is their  main  interest in the Plain, namely, the  right  of winter         grazing ; but, on the other hand, there will be no change in the status of, nor         imposition of taxation on the  district, and,  if the Afridis offer no resistance,         the construction, maintenance  and protection of the  roads will  be  a means         of subsistence, possibly  to  Afridis, certainly to some tribesmen, and  the         existence of the  roads  a- means of improving  the condition of the people         around them.  This is what has happened in Waziristan.     (iii) That this Government, like previous Governments, is  indulging in &quot; punitive         expeditions.&quot;  The answer to  this criticism is more difficult to  make.  The         expedition is undoubtedly intended to be punitive, if only in the economic         sense, and should the sections  who are forbidden to enter the Plain or British         India obstruct in any way the means of  carrying  out this  economic penalty,         engagements will take place and casualties occur.  Indeed, the opportunity         for inflicting  this military &quot; punishment &quot; on the tribes is regarded in some         quarters as welcome.  As against  this there have undoubtedly been, in  the         last six months, signs of lack of respect for Government reflected in many         quarters and, until recently, a dangerous situation existed  in  the Kurram         Valley.    My advisers are  of the opinion that such an operation involves no  military  risk and, I gather, will be of a limited character.    On the  whole I commend  the following  views  to the Cabinet,  subject  to  any observations which may be made upon them by the Government of India.      4806    75  9.30
   Let  us  assume  that  what we require  is (a) a plain  assertion of authority, and(?/)  material  measures to protect our territory.  To secure  (b) the Cabinet  mightapprove the  scheme for  making  the  road.  As to (a) the view may be taken that the mere making of the road is the most effective way of establishing the authority of theGovernment.    If we  decide  to  make the  road,  the question is,  should we  not take  everyprecaution to reduce the risk, which is already very considerable, of the making ofthe road provoking active opposition ?  If  this view is accepted, then it would appearto be sufficient to announce that the road is being constructed for protective purposes,and that it will not be used to impose economic pressure against any section of theAfridi tribe which is prepared to give suitable undertakings of good behaviour.    This would not exclude the requirement of some penalty or indemnity from the sections most deeply implicated in the aggression committed during the  last Summer,if the Government of India thought this necessary.    INDIA OFFICE,                                                        W.  B.        27th September  1930.       ,ME.MORANDUM PREPARED BY THE POLITICAL DEPARTMENT,  INDIA OFFICE.   Measures proposed by the  Government of India  for restraining                                  the  Afridis.   1. Between the  Anglo-Afghan frontier  and  the  administered  districts  of  the                                   North-West  Frontier  Province  there runs  a  Character of tribal  tract  on  North-  lu0untainous  tribal  tract  for  the  most  partWest fronts of India.               ^administered  and  only partially  occupied.Within this  tiact, however,  we exercise  exclusive political influence  and control.At its northern extremity  this area includes  three more or  less organised States, Dir,Swat and Chitral.   But along most of the tract there is no basis of society except an extremely loose tribal organisation.   Each  tribe is split up into numerous sectionsand sub-sections, at  constant feud with each other and rendering precarious obedienceto their headmen (maliks), or seeking  to adjtist their disputes in tribal assemblies(jirgas).  The tribesmen are warlike mountaineers  inhabiting a barren country quiteincapable of  supporting  the ever-increasing  population,  which naturally turns toTaiding;  they  are familiar with the  use  of  modern weapons,  of  which  they  nowpossess an abundance, and follow the Moslem religion (with a degree of fanaticismunknown  elsewhere throughout Islam);  otherwise  they must   be reckoned  asat most  semi-civilised ;  their  extreme  ignorance  and credulity &quot;makes  them  easyvictims of any agitation, especially under the cloak of religion, and the  one thing&quot;Which can  unite  them  to  common  action  is the cry  of a holy war  against  thenn believer.   2. Until recent years we pursued a policy of loose political control, practically notinterfering in tribal affairs except when misbehaviour called for a punitive expedition.More recently  we have established our  forces permanently in one large part of thearea (Waziristan),  with  a view to its  gradual civilisation, by establishing closer relations with the tribal authorities, by building roads (which  increase facilities for trade aud  pacific intercourse and provide employment in their making and upkeep),and by enlisting tribesmen for police duties, thus giving them a means of subsistence.In other parts, however, we have continued the policy of  abstaining from occupation and have sought to secure the good behaviour  of the tribes through their maliks, towhom we pay subventions for this purpose.   3. The Afridis who have  recently made two organised  incursions into the Peshawar                                   District of  British India  are  one of the most           The Afridis.             powerful of the frontier tribes.   They inhabit alarge area  to the  west and south, of  the Peshawar district, including the country on either side of the Khyber Pass and the northern portion of the Tirah (see the attachedrough sketch map).   They have enjoyed a  specially privileged position among othertribes  of the unadministered  area.  Our control has been  made as light as possible and [exercised otdy through headmen, to whom annual allowances  are paid ; there
has  been  no  occupation  of their  country nor  interference  in tribal  affairs. .  in deference to&apos; the susceptibilities of the  tribe  we  have even  voluntarily  refrained from aviation over their territory.   4. From  time  to time  agreements have  been made with  the tribe, or various-sections of it.  It is an expressed or implied condition of these  agreements that the tribesmen will refrain from  hostile acts against British territory and British subjects.   5. For some time past the young men of the tribe have been growing restless and        .     .   . .  ^ ... .  T       insubordinate,  and their  elders  and  headmen  AFRIDI INCURSIONS INTO BRITISH INDIA    I,P.;I^,I                 *  I    I\,R     AJ- -T           this summer              nave  tailed to  maintain control.   Many Alridis                                   who were in Peshawar  at the time were witnessesof the events  of 23rd  April and  the ensuing interregnum.   During  the followingmonths they were an easy mark for Congress and Khilafatist agitators, who circulatedstories as to the weakness of the Government forces and the readiness of the  indian troops to  mutiny, and of the villagers to rise,  and also as to cruelties practised  on.Mosleins and Government interference with the Moslem religion.   6. On the  night of  4th June  a force of 4,000 young bloods which had beengradually collecting, and after descending  the Bara  River  valley, had  establisheditself on the western border of the Kajuri plain,  made a  sudden incursion into theBritish district.  By 6th June, after doing some damage, they had been driven back.   7. The  second invasion  was more serious.  By  7th August a hostile force was concentrated in the caves on the western  border  of  the Kajuri  plain.   The enemy&apos;splan was that half the force should  infiltrate the villages round  Peshawar, contain thegarrison at  that place and cut its communication, while the other half attackedtowards the  bridge  over the Indus at Attock, thus&apos; threatening the nerve centre, ofthe whole of the North-West Frontier defence.   The attack of the second half of  the  force was  prevented by air action, but thefirst half succeeded  in slipping over the border and remained at large in the districttill about 15th  August,  concealing themselves  by day and  roaming about during the night, causing great confusion.  To meet  the danger it  became necessary to declaremartial law.  Owing to  the shelter which the nature of the  country afforded to theintruders our troops were unable to obtain effective contact with  them before theyretired.   8. Elated by two successful invasions  of British India, the Afridis  are  naturally                                   now in a very aggressive  mood.  Thev threaten  Probability of further Afridi attacks.   openly to repeat theil.  attacks, and are at present engaged in  exacting  penalties from  any pro-British  individtials who  can  be foundamong them.  The danger  from the Afridis  is  serious by itself, but there is also thedanger of  the  hostile movement spreading along: the  frontier.  One of the hostilemullahs is reported recently to  have alleged  that  he   has  received promises  ofassistance from the Mohmands and a number of other tribes, both on the British andthe Afghan side of the&apos; frontier.  It is  also reported  that the Afridis have decided  tosend a deputation to the Afghan Mohmands to enlist  their support.   It should  benoted that the Pathan  tribes on both sides of  the frontier are  identical in stock, andthe recent attacks of Afghan tribesmen  on the Kurram were  closely connected withthe unrest in our own tribal area.   9. The two Afridi incursions have been the  most  serious of the events on the                                   frontier  this summer, but they have  not been    Risk of a general tribal uprising     isolated occurrences.   In five other cases tribalunrest has culminated  in hostile action of a serious character.  Fortunately these movements have been sporadic and confined to small sections of the tribes involved,and have not synchronised.  Consequently it has  been comparatively easy to deal withthem.   If, however, steps are not now taken to deal with the Afridi menace, there isgrave  risk of the contagion spreading rapidly and  leading to simultaneous  risingsalong  the  frontier on a (very much  larger scale.  Such  a situation  would be verydifficult to cope with, and would in any case involve the employment of military forces                            &apos;       on  an  extensive scale.   Moreover,  if such a     and of war  with Afghanistan.      situation should arise, large numbers of Afghantribes would almost certainly become  involved and would  put  great pressure on theAfghan Government to join in the movement.  The present Afghan Government,though friendly to us, is not yet firmly established in its own country and would not
be able to resist such pressure, if sufficiently strong ; in  that case it might either  be forced to yield and make war on us, or it might be overturned by its own subjects and afghanistan  would  relapse into  the anarchy  from which Nadir  Shah is graduallyrescuing it.    10. It will be seen, therefore, how essential it is to re-establish our authority over           .,         ,   ,.   &apos;       the Afridis and  to take prompt measures  to      Necessity of prompt action.       disabuse them of the notion that  they can attackBritish India with impunity, and  that the^Government of India is powerless to defendit.  By its recent acts of war the  tribe  has annulled its  agreements with  the BritishGovernment,  which  is  thus  free to  take  Avhatever measures  it  may judge  mostexpedient.  The very limited measures which are proposed  by the  Government ofIndia and which are the minimum that they  consider necessary are described below.    11. The Chief Commissioner of the North-West Frontier Province on 24th August    ^, . ,  n    .  .    ,       ,       suggested  that  the  ideal solution of the Afridi    Chief  Commissioner s proposals.     pi;orjlem was  to take over the Khyber and  toestablish  our forces  permanently in Tirah as we have done  in Waziristan in recentyears.  Failing this, he proposed, besides certain purely defensive measures in british territory,  that  we  should  withdraw our  self-denying ordinance  in  the matter  of aviation,  and should further establish two posts on the Besai Spur and construct oneor  more  roads across the Kajuri and Aka Khel plains, and also a  road  from AliMasjid south-westward towards  Chora.  It  will be seen from the map that theseproposals involve  a limited  programme of  road-making on  the fringe of the Afridicountry  just  beyond our  own  administrative  border,  but,  of  course,  within theinternational frontier.    12. The Government of India decided  at once that  the permanent occupation of&apos;                                   Tirah could not  be undertaken, and  after  a   Government of IncuVs  proposals.     conference with the local officers at Peshawar,they have submitted the following proposals, on the lines  of the Chief Commissionersalternative suggestions :--    (1) They would despatch  a force from   Bara  Fort to the neighbourhood of         Mamanai, on the Bara   River, where it emerges from the  hills  into  the,         Kajuri Plain, a distance of 12 miles.  The advance  would  begin-on loth         October.   (Subsidiary forces would  be located (on the British  administrative         border) near the Besai spur and at Matanni.)    (2) The  troops would  be used to examine  the  terrain with a view to selecting         a site  for  a strategic  point  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Mamanai and the         alignments of a metalled road  from Bara to such point, and of an  unmetalled         road therefrom via the Besai spur back to Jamrud.    (3) Sections which may attack or molest the troops would be  dealt with by land         or air, as may seem best.    (4) The troops would cover  the  construction of these roads during  the coming        : cold weather.  -     (5) The strategic point and  any subsidiary posts  necessary to  secure communi-         cations would be  subsequently  held, for  which  purpose two  regular         battalions can be made  available.     (6) Before the advance begins, the  Chief Commissioner would declare the Afridi         tribe, or such  sections of it as he thinks  fit, to be hostile  (which implies         inter alia prohibition of access to British India),  would announce our intention         to take steps for the effective control  of the Kajuri and. Aka Khel Plains         as a consequence of their recent invasion  and to prevent its recurrence,&apos; arid         would warn them that opposition to our troops  will be dealt with by air or         land.  He would treat thus  either with the tribe as a whole or with sections         of it, if there are signs of disunion of which he can take advantage.    13. Certain  subsidiary  proposals  made  after  the. conference  at  Peshawar are                                   considered  . bv the Government of India  to  beSubsidiary proposals still under Govern-  desirable]e  in principle,  though  pending receipt    ment of India s consideration.       ., ,.       . CL     4-  *,   ,*?   1  ,   f    , l1                                   ot further information they nave not yet readieda definite conclusion  regarding them.   Those are :     (a) To make  a  metalled road from  Ali Masjid to  Chora Kandao, a. distance of         4 or-5 miles  to the pass,  with  possibly  a short  uninetallecl extension to
         the valley beyond.  Such a road would make it an easy matter to  forestall         any future attacks by way of the Bazar River Valley.  This  route was used         by our troops in 1919 and a track was made.    &apos;(b)  To improve and metal the road  which was made last year from Marai, near         the border of the Kohat District,  westward in the Shiah. salient,  through         country belonging to certain friendly Orakzais, and possibly to continue an         unmetalled extension  to Kalaia on  the Mastura River.   This road-making         project seems desirable in itself.  The Orakzais in  that part belong to the         Shiah sect,  and  stand in need  of protection,  as their  neighbours OF the         Sunni sect are  constantly at feud  with them ; last year the Sunni Orakzais         and Afridis evicted them from  their lands, which were not restored till this         spring, after a prolonged mediation by the Government.    14.  Before formulating their proposals, the Government of India took the  views of         . ^ ... , -T, ...    . *r ,   .     His Majesty&apos;s  Minister at Kabul.   The  latter  Yiews of British Minister at Kabul.    Sllggested that, in deciding what measures shouldhe adopted, account must be taken of the risk of Afghan participation on the side ofour  rebellious  tribesmen ; and the question is up to  what point the present AfghanGovernment could restrain  sympathetic  action by  Afghan tribesmen, and  resist pressure from the latter  to take action against us ; the danger from such pressure onthe Afghan Government would  be grave in present circumstances if we took over theadministration of the Khyber or sought  to occupy Tirah ; it would still be appreciablein the  case of  the adoption  of the Government  of India&apos;s present proposals, but mr-. Maconachie thinks that if these proposals are essential  from the point of view ofIndia, the risk  ought to  be faced, and  that, after the  last Afridi incursion,  there-establishment of our military prestige is  certainly required from the point of view:of Anglo-Afghan relations.    15.  The measures proposed  by the Government of  India, except in so far as they                                    are purely defensive,  are political in character,  Defensive and political nature of the    j e  tliey wcnucj enable us, through the occupation             proposa s.               Q   a sm^\\ comer 0f tribal territory, to  establishbetter  control  of the tribe  as a whole.   They would also hasten  the operation ofcivilising influences and bring greater prosperity to the  tribe by affording additional facilities for trade and employment.   The military measures required to carry out theproposals  are not in any way on a  major  scale.  The troops at the disposal of theGeneral Officer Commanding, Northern  Command, would be ample to cover  the road-making proposed and to meet any attacks the Afridis may make.    16.  The immediate objects of the proposals are :       (a) defensive, to make  it  possible  TO prevent further concentrations of  hostile         forces in the caves which were used last August ;  and     (6)  to  enable  us to  bring economic  pressure  to bear on  the  Afridis  in  the         immediate future,  by denying them the pasturage of the  Kajuri  plain, to         which some of  the most guilty sections  are accustomed  to migrate  during         the winter  months.  The tribe (or particularly guilty sections of  it, at the         discretion of the Chief Commissioner) will also be excluded from the  British         district,  in which some of  the  tribesmen normally spend the winter.  There         is evidence that the  Afridis are aware that measures of this character are         likely, and  they have been  discussing among themselves the alternative of         wintering in Afghan territory.   Nethertheless, it is hoped that the  measures          proposed, by interrupting their normal economic routine, will  constitute an         effective form  of pressure, and  go far to induce a more reasonable frame          of mind.    17. But beyond  these immediate objects the modest programme of road-making                                    proposed&apos; by the  Government  of  India  would  Economic and social benefits accruing   naturally operate in the direction of a  civilising            to the tribe.              policy  of the kind which has been a conspicuous success in Waziristan.   It is, in fact, the Waziristan policy on a very reduced scale and with reference to one small corner of the Afridis&apos; country which is easily accessible. The road-making policy in Waziristan  has  in fact effected great economic and social improvement ;  the tribes there have been  quick to recognise it and are asking for more roads.  It is probable that the  Afridis also,  or the less hostile among them,
when once any initial opposition has been surmounted, will see the ultimate advantage to themselves of the  Government of India&apos;s programme, the improved facilities forintercourse and trade, and the prospects which it holds out of increased remunerativeemployment of local levies (khassadars) for police duties and  possibly of  local labour in the work of construction and maintenance.    18. The Government of India estimate the cost of their programme at  Rs. 1,00,000                                   ( 7.500) per annum for  payment  of khassadars,Estimates of financial cost of proposals  tfS-  2,00,000 ( 15,000)  per mensem while  thesubmitted by the Government of India.  c?vering troo vg  are          [n  the field) andRs. 14,50,000 ( 108,750) non-recurring for roads,  including  those suggested  in para. 13 (a)  and (b)  above.   The  whole of the  expenditure  will, of  course, be met from Indian revenues.    19. The question  to be decided is whether to agree with the Government of India                                   as to the necessity of taking action to deal  with            Conclusion.              tliis  problem and as to the expediency  of theparticular measures which they propose.  If such a course is decided  on they shouldbe informed that proposals (1) to (6) in para. 12  above are sanctioned, and  that  theymay also proceed with the subsidiary proposals (a) and (b) in  para. 13  if on receipt ofthe further information which they have called for they conclude that  these proposals;should be adopted.
