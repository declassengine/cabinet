INTERIM  REPORT.I INTRODUCTORY.(a)  Composition and Terms of Reference.   1.  ON the 10th July, 1930, the Economic  Advisory Council(E.A.C./6th Meeting,  Conclusion 6) appointed a Committee  withthe  following Terms of reference :        &quot; To consider the  question of migration  from the  United   Kingdom  to oversea  parts  of  the  Empire  in  its  economic   aspects (a)  in  the  immediate  future,  and (b) over  a longer   period, and to  advise whether Government action to  stimulate  - such migration is economically or otherwise desirable.!&apos;   2.  The Committee is constituted as follows :       Viscount Astor (Chairman).      Professor A. M. Carr-Saunders, M.A.      Mr. G.  D. H. Cole.      Captain L.  F. Ellis,  C.B.E.,  D.S.O., M.C.      Mr. Christopher Turnor.   3.  At  our first meeting held on  the 22nd July, 1930,  we considered the procedure to be adopted in our inquiry.  We decided,in the first  instance,  to obtain written  evidence  from the oversea settlement  Department  on  the  working of the present migrationpolicy and from the Ministry of Labour  on the supplementary workundertaken  by that Department, and, in particular, on the  methodsadopted  for recruiting for  migration,  and  on  the  work of theMinistry&apos;s  training centres.  We  further decided  to invite theTreasury to furnish us  with  evidence on  the  financial aspects of migration,  and the Colonial Office  on the possibility of extendingWhite  Settlement  in  the   Crown Colonies  and  other  british territories.   4.  The evidence  referred to in the preceding paragraph wassupplemented by oral  evidence  from Mr.  G.  G. Whiskard, C.B.,Vice-Chairman,  Oversea  Settlement  Committee,  Mr.  C.  W.  G.Eady,  Principal  Assistant  Secretary,  Employment  and  TrainingDepartment, Ministry of Labour, and Mr.  A. P.  Waterfield, C.B.,Assistant Secretary, Treasury.   5.  At an early stage of our inquiry we were impressed withthe  view that  a long-range  migration  policy  would  be  more effective if  accompanied by  adequate facilities  for land settlement in this country.   On  this aspect we received  oral evidence  fromMr.  E.  L.  Mitchell, O.B.E., Assistant Secretary, Land  Division,Ministry of  Agriculture and  Fisheries, who explained  the proposalsof that  Department   for extending  existing  facilities  for  landsettlement.   6.  We  have  also  received statements or  oral evidence  fromMr.  C. Bavin, O.B.E., General Secretary, Migration Department,The  Young  Men&apos;s Christian Associations of  Great Britain  andIreland, from Commissioner D. C.  Lamb,  International Secretary.The  Salvation Army and from other bodies.Mr.  A.  F.  Hemming,  C.B.E.,   Joint   Secretary,   Economic   Advisory Council.Joint Secretaries     to the   Committee.Mr.   W.   J.   Garnett,   Oversea   Settlement  Department.(b) Procedure adopted by the Committee.[21744]B 2
                  (o), Arrangement of Report.   7.  In the course of  the evidence referred  to in the preceding paragraphs,  there emerged a number of conclusions, some of which appear to us germane to the discussions on Empire migration whichwe  assume  will take place  at  the Imperial  Conference  now in session.  We  therefore decided to present forthwith the presentInterim Report,  which is confined to those matters action on whichwould  involve discussion  with His Majesty&apos;s  Governments in theDominions.   8.  In Section II we discuss briefly  the economic importanceof migration and indicate  those aspects  of the  question which we propose to examine  more fully  in  our Final Report.   Section IIIis devoted to an  examination of the special difficulties of the presenttime in regard to migration.  Section IV contains  a  brief outline of the  principal  forms of Government assistance to migration, both that accorded within the terms of the  Empire  Settlement Act,1922,  and the supplementary assistance  granted  from  unemploy-ment relief  funds by the Ministry of  Labour.  In  Section V  weexamine the difficulties which have been experienced in the UnitedKingdom in  carrying  out the  migration policy  laid down  byParliament  in 1922,  and in Section VI  we  indicate the principalconclusions  which we have reached in  the  light of the  evidenceso far received.  In Section VII we  give  our recommendations which,   with  our  principal  conclusions,  are  summarised  inSection VIII.   II.-THE  ECONOMIC  IMPORTANCE OF  MIGRATION.   9.  We propose in our Final Report to examine  the  economic value of  migration in  the light of  the information  availableregarding the  present  and  probable  future  trend of populationrequirements in this country and in the Dominions.  We hope  also on that  occasion to examine this question in relation to public expenditure in this country and to  the development of Empiremarkets.  We  realise  that  it would  be of great value if it were possible  to -frame a reliable estimate of  the  sum of money  permigrant up to which it is to the economic interest of this countryto assist  migration.   We  fear,  however, that  the number ofunknown  factors is such as  to render difficult any close estimateof this kind.   10.  In our inquiry we have been much struck by the importanceof migration as  a  means of securing  a  redistribution  of  whitepopulation within the  Empire  which we believe, in  the  interestsof all parts of the  Empire,  is urgently required.  We have  alsobeen much impressed by the  importance of securing a much higherdegree than  exists  at present  of mobility for labour within  theEmpire.   We  are  convinced  that  any   long-range  policy  formigration should be so  framed as to encourage  and develop  the mobility  of labour, and indeed the free movement of populationgenerally between  different  parts of the  Empire.  In our final report,   we  propose  therefore  to  examine  the  possibility  of arranging for  reduced  passages, subject to appropriate safeguards,not only  from the United Kingdom to the Dominions, but  from theDominions to this country.   11.  The  economic  difficulties of the  present time, to whichwe refer  briefly in  the following section,  Section  III, are such asto render  impracticable any immediate  extension of migration.The  most that can usefully  be done  is to take advantage of suchopportunities as offer for assisting the migration of persons  followingoccupations for which, even  in  the circumstances of  the  moment,there are  openings in the Dominions.  We are satisfied that, whenthe  present   economic  difficulties  have   passed,  a  reasonableexpenditure of public funds  by  His Majesty&apos;s Government in  theUnited Kingdom on migration within the Empire is desirable fromthe point of view of this country and of the  Dominions,  providedthat the policy adopted conforms to the  general principles  indicatedin this Section.
III. THE SPECIAL DIFFICULTIES OF THE PRESENT TIME                IN REGARD  TO, MIGRATION.              (a) The World Fall in Wholesale Prices.    12.   The  fall in wholesale prices which has taken place duringthe last year  may be regarded as an acceleration of a process which had been  going on for  a  number  of years, but its sharpness and rapidity have naturally  entailed  great handicaps  to trade and industry.   The Board of  Trade Wholesale Price Index, based on 1924, fell from 8.1-8 in August 1929  to 70-9 in August  1930,  a decline of  18-3 per cent, on the year.  This fall,  however,  was not evenly  distributed  among  the commodities entering into the Index, but was largely  concentrated  on  staple raw  produce.   The price, for example,  of No.  2 Northern Manitoba wheat fell by 43-8 per cent, between the  30th  September,  1929, and the 30th September, 1930, in spite of the fact  that the heavy crop of  1928 had already caused  a severe depression of wheat prices.   The price of wool fell by 87-0 per cent, in the same period.  Wool and wheat, of course, are the staple exports of  the  two  largest Dominions,  Canada and Australia.    13.   The  slump in prices has affected countries producing raw materials  more severely than  it has manufacturing countries  such as Great Britain, which have  succeeded in maintaining the prices of their exports  at a higher comparative level than  the prices of their imports.  Other commodities which have suffered declines in value above  the average  in the  past  twelve  months  include tin, which has fallen  by 38-4 per cent.,  copper,  which has fallen by 44-6 per  cent.,  and  rubber, which has fallen by 62-2 per cent. In almost every country  this  slump in prices  has entailed severetrade depression and  unemployment.   It has seriously diminished the capacity  of  the  Dominions to absorb new population.  The Dominions are indeed  faced  with  an  unemployment problem  oftheir own, which  had made it necessary for them for the  moment to place severe restrictions on immigration.                        (b)  Other  Factors.    14.   A further factor  which reduces the absorptive capacity ofthe Dominions for  British migrants is the extent to which availableopenings overseas  are filled by foreign  immigrants.  This factor is of special  importance in  the case of  Canada.  During the five years ending  the 31st December,  1929, the total number of immigrants from Europe  into Canada  was 587,000, of whom  260,000 were british  and 327,000  foreign.  The  proportion of British migrantswas  rather higher in  1929  than  in  previous  years,  the totalimmigration in 1929 being 133,000 persons, of whom 67,000 were British  and 66,000 foreign, but during the first eight months of thepresent  year  the  total  immigration  from  Europe  was   72,000persons, of whom 31,000 were British and  41,000  were  foreign.In 1929 the  Canadian Government limited the number of singlemale immigrants from Central and Southern Europe, and duringthe present year  they increased  the  restrictions on  this  class  ofimmigrant.  Other classes of immigrants from those countries are also subject to occupational and means tests.  In spite, however,of these restrictions,  considerably more than half the immigration from Europe into Canada during the first eight months of this year was non-British.   The  Canadian  Government  undertook  to place8,000 British trainees in  farm employment in the spring of this year,but, owing to the  economic difficulties  to which we have referred,they found it  impossible  to place more than a third of  this number.Yet, in this period, approximately 8,000 single farm workers from central and Southern Europe were admitted to the Dominion.    15.  An extension of  the  restrictions  on foreign  immigrationmight, have made it possible for the whole of the British traineesto have been absorbed in accordance with the original arrangement.. We; boliove that  migration might  be  materially assisted if  HisMajesty&apos;s Governments in  the Dominions were prenared to increaseexisting preferences to British migrants.
   16.  In recent years the Dominions have been mainly anxiousto increase by migration their agricultural population, and on this account another factor  which renders migration less easy than inthe past is to be found in the reduction of the agricultural population in this country  as compared with that of  the  towns, as this hascontracted the field from which can be drawn the class of migrantsspecially  desired.   The extension of facilities for land  settlement in this country,  to which we refer in paragraph  29 below  would tend to improve the position in  this respect.IY. THE  MAIN  FORMS   BY  WHICH  HIS  MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT  IN THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS ASSISTED                         MIGRATION.   17.  Government assistance to migration is. at  present, mainlygoverned in this  country  by the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, bywhich  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  in the  United Kingdom areempowered to incur expenditure on  schemes of assisted  migration,provided that at least one-half of the cost of each scheme is derivedfrom some other source than United Kingdom funds, i.e., from oneof His Majesty&apos;s  Governments in  the  Dominions or from public or private organisations in this country or overseas.   18.  The assistance  provided  under schemes  arranged underthe Act takes the following forms :    (a) Special reduced fares for migrants.       The only arrangement for special reduced fares for migrants   so far  negotiated is the British migrant   10 ocean passage rate   to Canada, which came into operation on the 1st January,  1929.   The difference  between the  ordinary   fare  of   18  15s. and   the  special  10  rate is  shared  equally  by  His  Majesty&apos;s   Government  in the  United Kingdom   and the British  North   Atlantic Steamship Companies.   The special rate  is  available   for any bon&amp;  fide* British migrant from the United Kingdom.   The Canadian Government have agreed that persons  who pay   their own fare at  this rate  shall be  regarded  as unassisted   migrants and shall be subjected to no other restrictions than   those  imposed  on  full  fare-paying  migrants  (e.g.,  medical   examination).   (b) Special  assisted  passage  schemes  arranged  with  His          Majesty&apos;s Governments  in the Dominions.       Special assisted passage schemes apply to particular classes of   settlers  acceptable  to  the  Dominion  Governments  concerned,   e.g., settlers  nominated by relatives or friends already settled   overseas, men and  boys for farm work,  and women for domestic   service.  All  assisted migrants  are  required  to  satisfy  the   Dominion  authorities  as  to  health and character.    Assisted   passage schemes have been arranged with His Majesty&apos;s Govern-   ments  in  Canada,  Australia,  New  Zealand  and  Southern   Rhodesia.  -    (c) Training in  the United Kingdom.       Schemes have  been arranged  with  voluntary  organisations   and local migration committees for training boys and single men   in farm work and women in household work, and with the British   Legion for training families.    (d)  Supplementary  schemes  with  Voluntary  Associations  for          providing passages, incidental expenses, aftercare, cfcc.       Arrangements have been  made with Voluntary  Associations   for  providing passage  assistance for migrants  ineligible  under    Government  schemes,  for  the provision  of  outfits  and  for   contributions  towards  the cost of the aftercare of  migrants    (mainly single women and juveniles).   * NOTI . Any person who before sailing signs a declaration of his or her Intention of residing  permanently in Canada.
    (e) Land Settlement in the Dominions.       Schemes for the settlement of British migrants on farms of    their own overseas have been arranged with the Governments of    certain States in  Australia, with  the Dominion and Provincial    Governments in  Canada, with  the  Government  of  Southern    Bhodesit. and with the Canadian Pacific Bailway and  Hudson&apos;s    Bay Companies.    (f) Development Schemes.       The only example  of a development scheme arranged under    the Act is the Migration  and Settlement Agreement negotiated    in 1925 with His  Majesty&apos;s Government in the  Commonwealth    of Australia (usually  known  as  the   34,000,000  Agreement),    under which  the  two Governments share  the cost of making    advances, at specially  low rates of interest, to the State Govern-    ments for expenditure  on approved schemes  of development.    (g) Publicity.      and    (h) Grants   towards,  administrative   expenses  of  Voluntary          Associations:^      Expenditure on these services is  provided on the Vote for    Oversea  Settlement outside  the  Empire Settlement  Act,  but    grants towards  the administrative  expenditure of Voluntary    Associations  are subject to the 50 per cent, principle embodied    in the Act.    19.  In addition to the expenditure on assisted migration  underthe Empire Settlement Act, the cost of a number of schemes which,owing to the  absence  of a contribution of one-half of the cost fromother than Government sources,  are  outside the scope of the  Acthas  been defrayed, since  1925, by  the  Ministry of Labour fromfunds provided by Parliament for the relief of unemployment, viz.,    (a) the establishment  and maintenance of centres  for training          single  men  in  farm  work with  a  view to settlement          overseas (at Claydon, Brandon, &amp;c.);    (b) contributions  towards the  cost of establishing  and  main-          taining local training centres for women on the basis of a          grant in excess  of the 50 per cent,  permissible under the          Empire Settlement Act;    (c) free passages and incidental expenses for  trainees ;    (d) assistance towards  the cost of the passages to Canada of          approximately 8,000 men  for  the Canadian  harvest in          1928,  and for part, or all, of the return passages of about          half this number;    (e)  assisted passages, etc.,  for single men and families  recruited          from distressed  areas in this country for work in Canada.   20.  The  net expenditure* under the  Empire Settlement Act,1922, up to the 31st March 1930, was  5,593,000.  The expenditure from Ministry of Labour Funds since 1925 on the schemes referredto above has amounted to  529,000.   21.  We propose  in our  main report to examine  the various forms of  assisted migration referred  to  above,  and  to  consider how far they are applicable to the various classes of migrants, e.g.,men, women, juveniles and families.V.-THE DIFFICULTIES EXPERIENCED IN THE UNITEDKINGDOM   IN  CARRYING  OUT  EXISTING  MIGRATION                           POLICY.   22.   The main  difficulty in carrying out  the  policy embodied in the Empire Settlement  Act,  i.e., the better distribution of thewhite population of the  Empire,  has  been due  to  the  conditionswhich have  prevailed in  the oversea Dominions.   To this we  have referred  in paragraphs 12 and 13 above.   * I.c, expenditure after deduction of sums received in repayment of  loans &apos;advanced under the Act.
   28.  There have, however, been certain obstacles to the fulfil-menfc of the policy which are remediable by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in  the United Kingdom.   We indicate  these  briefly in  thefollowing paragraphs.(a) Financial.   24.  Although at the Prime Ministers&apos; Conference of 1921  HisMajesty&apos;s Governments  in  the  Dominions (with  the exception ofthe Union of South Africa) indicated their willingness to co-operatefinancially with His  Majesty&apos;s Government in  the United kingdom in a State-aided policy of  Empire  settlement  and  migration,His  Majesty&apos;s Governments in  the  Dominions are  finding it increasing difficult  to  provide  funds for the settlement of  newarrivals,  even from  the United  Kingdom, without  also providing:similar facilities  for the settlement of their existing populations,including earlier  arrivals from this and foreign countries.   25.  Within the  limitations imposed by the Empire  SettlementAct,  and in particular  the  stipulation  of  a  minimum contribution of 50 per cent,  towards the cost  of  schemes arranged under it,adequate funds have been available for such schemes  .as&apos;it has beenfound possible to approve.   But the necessity of  finding half  the-cost  of a scheme from  outside sources,  either from a dominion government  or from some private or public  organisation in  thiscountry or  overseas  has constituted  a real  obstacle  to devising-suitable schemes  or to  enabling such schemes to be brought  intooperation.   26.  With regard to other possible partners with  His Majesty&apos;s-Government   in  the United  Kingdom  in  schemes   of  assistedmigration,  viz.,  the  Voluntary Associations,  the  extent  to whichthey  can  co-operate  depends upon their  ability  to  raise  at least one-half  of  the  money required for  their work  from charitable-sources or from other Governments.   The Associations  have foundincreasing difficulty  in  raising funds  to  carry on their work  andits  extent  has  been  inevitably  limited  by  this fact.  We  are convinced that, as long as  the  present conditions are maintained,.any  considerable expansion  of their work is  out  of the  question,and  even  their  existing activities may  be  endangered by   lackof funds.   27.  These difficulties   are  increased  by  the rigidity of  the50  per cent,  principle embodied  in  the  Act.   Thus,  speaking generally, a contribution in cash by His  Majesty,&apos;s Government inthe United  Kingdom is only permissible  if the contribution made-by the other party is also  in cash.  No consideration can be givento other  expenditure, e.g.,  expenditure on administration incurred in connection with settlement overseas or  contributions by migrantstowards the cost of their own passage,  etc.(b) Administrative.   28.  We  have already  explained (paragraph 19)  that, in order-to carry out certain desirable schemes which were outside the scopeof the Empire Settlement  Act,  the cost  has been  provided fromMinistry of Labour funds.  As  a result, there has grown up an undesirable  division of  responsibility  between the Oversea Settle-ment Department and  the  Ministry of Labour.  In addition,  this association of the Ministry  of Labour with migration  has created a false impression in this country and in the Dominions that therelief  of  unemployment   and  oversea  settlement  are  closely associated.   We  propose to examine  this  question  further in our:Final Report.(e) Absence  of  Adequate  Facilities for  Land Settlement  in  the-       United Kingdom.    29.   We have received evidence which indicates that any policyof Empire settlement would be more  effective if accompanied by a.policy of land settlement  in this  country.   Such a policy wouldbe  of  great  psychological value  in overcoming  some of  the-opposition  which at  present exists to the advocacy of settlement
overseas.  Moreover, the settlement of families on the land in thiscountry would in course of  time provide a reservoir of men andwomen  with agricultural  experience,  from whom settlers  for  theDominions  could be  recruited.   We shall  consider this matter further  in our Final Eeport.    SO.  In  view of  evidence submitted to us we have come to  theconclusion that the present world situation in regard to agricultural production  has had  an adverse  effect  upon land  settlement  in countries  overseas.    Since 1924 there  has been  serious  over-production of wheat and other  main commodities and until  the relation between supply and demand  has adjusted itself, it wouldbe unwise to urge any special development in land  settlement.(d) Other alleged reasons.    81.  Reference  has been made  in the evidence  placed beforeus  as to the alleged  adverse effect on migration  of the provisions for social  insurance  in this  country.   The  Inter-DepartmentalCommittee which was appointed  to consider this matter in 1925(the Maclean Committee),  after  a  thorough  examination of  thesubject, came to the conclusion  that though the  two chief  causes which tended at that time to discourage migration  were  (1) badtrade conditions,  and  (2)  the restrictions which  the  DominionGovernments  found  it necessary to  place  on the  grant  of assistedpassages,  the cumulative effect of social  insurance schemes was a subsidiary  cause,  and that  such schemes did, in fact, have  ananchoring  effect on  population.  The developments which  havetaken place since 1925 may have  accentuated this effect, but in sofar as social services do operate in this way, it is.probable that theydo  so to a greater extent in bad times than in times  of  prosperity.It has, however, to be borne in mind that, even if the causes which make people reluctant to migrate  are more powerful  in  bad.times,equally  the opportunities for  migration  into the Dominions  are less at such times.    32.  So  far as  pensions  schemes  are  concerned,  the facilities provided by the Widows&apos;,  Orphans&apos;, and Old Age  contributory pensions Act, 1929,  for the payment of pensions overseas,  and  for persons  who settle overseas  to remain in  insurance  as  voluntarycontributors may  be regarded as having largely prevented such schemes from adversely affecting migration.                     YI__CONCLUSIONS.    33.   We consider that the following are the general principles-which should underlie  the  future policy of His  Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in  the United Kingdom in  regard  to oversea  settlement.In  the first place, the direct intervention of Governments (whether in  this  country or in the Dominions) should be limited as far aspossible.   For this  reason  we regard it  as  desirable to stimulateas  soon as circumstances permit the migration of persons who arein  a  position to pay their own way,  for example, by arranging for special  reduced fares  (see  paragraph  18  (a)).   There is-general  agreement  that  this  is   the  most   satisfactory  formof  Government  aid to  migration,  arid  that  migrants  of   this class  constitute the most desirable  type  of  settler  both from  thepoint  of view  of this country and  of the Dominions.   Migrationof  this  class involves the minimum of Government  intervention,and the  settler who himself defrays the cost of his journey, even at a reduced rate, carries with him a greater spirit of independence and self-reliance  than a man who receives direct assistance either from  Governments or from Voluntary Associations.  Further,  thegeneral-reduction of passage rates would increase the freedom of movement of population throughout the Empire,  a matter to whichwe  attach very great importance.  Such mobility cannot of  course be effected solely by a policy of cheapening travel in one direction,and as explained in paragraph 10 above, we  propose in our FinalEeport to  consider  how far  it may *be possible  to  arrange  forreduced  rates  for return  passages  from the Dominions to  this-country.    [21744]                                              c
   34.  We regard it as of importance that every effort should bemade to secure as great a degree of financial  co-operation as ispossible  from  His  Majesty&apos;s Governments   in  the  Dominions,particularly in  regard to those classes of settlers regarded by them as specially suitable.   85.  There  will, of course, always be a considerable number of otherwise desirable settlers who will  (a) be unable to find the  costof a  reduced passage, or, if able to provide the passage money,  willbe unable  to proceed overseas without some additional assistance,and  (b) be ineligible under  any  special assisted passage schemesarranged with Dominion Governments.  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United  Kingdom should, however, so far as possible divestthemselves of direct responsibility for providing individual migrantswith  assistance.   Departments should  not,  as  is the  case withMinistry  of Labour  trainees,  become  directly responsible   for individual  migrants.  For this reason,  the  fullest possible  use should be made of the services of Voluntary Associations, both inthis  country and in  the Dominions, preferably those  with  branchorganisations or with affiliations overseas.  Such Associations should in any  case  be  specially selected  and  approved  both  by  HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and by the OverseaGovernment concerned.  The general principle should be laid down that migrants requiring special assistance  should be  able to  secureit through  one of  the  approved  organisations, the  latter being required to undertake full responsibility for the placing and after-care of persons assisted through their organisation.   86.  His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should,in our view, be free, where they so desire, to undertake the wholeof the expenditure incurred  (including that of training) up  to thetime when the  migrant is placed in employment overseas, and  any expenditure necessary  to  secure  and  maintain such  employment(e.g., placing and  after-care  organisation).                 YII. RECOMMENDATIONS.   87.  For the reasons given in Section III of this Report, we donot consider that any considerable development of migration wouldbe practicable at the present time.  It will not, however, be possibleto take  advantage  of  circumstances,  when  they  again becomefavourable, unless in the meantime steps have been taken to remedy the defects in the present system,  to which we have referred.   Wetherefore  recommend  that  during  the  presence  in  London ofMinisters  of  His  Majesty&apos;s  Governments  in  the  Dominionsdiscussions should take  place regarding the basis of the policy whichshould govern migration when circumstances permit of  its renewalon a larger scale.(a) Amendment  by  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  in  the United             Kingdom of Empire Settlement Act, 1922.   38.  We have already referred to the difficulties created by theconditions  imposed  by  the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, and, inparticular, to those  created by a rigid insistence  on the principlethat not more than 50 per cent., of the cost of any scheme should be defrayed from United Kingdom funds.  In our view, expenditure onmigration falls into two distinct classes, namely :     (a) expenditure designed to enable persons to migrate from this          country for the purpose of taking up fresh occupations in          the Dominions;  under this heading we  include expend! -          ture on the following services :             (i) passage  and incidental expenses before departure;          (ii) landing money  and reasonable placing, reception, and                 incidental expenses after arrival,  after-care.;&amp;c.;          (iii) training;           (iv) administrative  expenses   of   approved  migration                 agencies; and
    (b) capital expenditure            (i)  on land  settlement schemes for the  assistance of                migrants after their arrival in the Dominions; and          (ii)  on development schemes.    89.  We  recommend  that  Parliament should  be invited to approve amending legislation abolishing the statutory proportion asbetween  His Majesty&apos;s Government in  the United Kingdom  andand His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions and/or VoluntaryAssociations  in  respect  of  expenditure  for  the  provision  ofpassages,  &amp;c, i.e.,  on  those services indicated  in paragraph 38  (a)above.  We do not suggest that His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom  should normally undertake the whole cost of such services, but that in the furtherance of the policy of migration theyshould be  free to undertake such a proportion of the expenses asmay appear appropriate in any given case.    40.  As regards the financing of land settlement or development schemes,  we  recommend  that  Parliament should maintain  thepresent  50 per cent, principle,  but  should be  asked  to authoriseaccount being  taken in  the calculation of the cost of such schemes ofcontributions other than cash, e.g., contributions in the form of landprovided,  supervisory and administrative expenses in such  manner as may-be agreed upon between His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom and the Dominion Governments or  other approvedsettlement agencies overseas.   We further recommend that, inthe case of development schemes in  which provision is made  forthe payment,   from sources other than United  Kingdom funds,of 50  per cent, of any loss that may ultimately occur, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom should be  authorised to provide more  than one-half of the capital required.(b) New Basis of Policy between His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom and His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions.    41.  We realise that the acceptance  of the proposals containedin the preceding paragraphs would impose an increased financial burden upon United Kingdom funds.  In view,  therefore, of the  factthat migration is a policy designed to benefit the Dominions equally with this country, we are  of the opinion  that,  as a condition of thegrant of the increased financial assistance  which  we  recommend,His Majesty&apos;s  Governments in the Dominions  should be invited to subscribe  to the  principle  that  persons  assisted under  reducedpassage schemes  described in paragraph  83 of this Eeport should(like  the  Canadian   10 rate passengers) continue to be treated by His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions as full fare-payingmigrants,  i.e., they should not  be subjected to  any restrictionsother than  those   imposed  on  such  migrants  (e.g.,  medical examination).   We  further recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ments in the Dominions should be invited, so far  as circumstances in  their  Dominions  permit,  to  increase  existing  preferential treatment of British migrants over those from foreign countries.VIII. SUMMARY  OF  CONCLUSIONS  AND  RECOMMEN-                          DATIONS.                        (a)  Conclusions.   42.   For the convenience of J;he Economic Advisory Council, wesummarise.our principal conclusions as follows:    (a) In the interests of all parts of the Empire, migration polioy         should be directed towards securing  a  redistribution  of         white population within the Empire;  and  should be  so         framed as to encourage and develop the mobility of labour,         and,  indeed,  the free  movement of population generally         between different parts of the Empire.     [21744]                                             D
(b) The economic difficulties of the present time are such as to      render  impracticable   any  immediate  extension   of      migration.   The most that can usefully be done is to take      advantage of such opportunities as offer for  assisting the      migration of persons following occupations for which,  even      in the circumstances of the moment, there are openings in      the Dominions.(o) We are satisfied that, when the present economic difficulties      have  passed, a reasonable expenditure of public funds by      His  Majesty&apos;s Government  in  the United  Kingdom  on      migration within the Empire is desirable from the point of      view  of this country and of the  Dc linions, provided that      the  policy  adopted  conforms to the  general  principles      indioated in conclusion (a) above.(d) The policy to be adopted  for the furtherance  of migration      should be designed to limit, as far as possible, direct inter-      vention of Governments  (whether in this country or in the      Dominions).  For this reason, we regard it as  desirable      to  stimulate,  as  soon  as   circumstances  permit,  the      migration of persons who are in a position to pay their own      way,  for example, by arranging for special reduced fares.(e) As regards potentially desirable settlers (of whom there will      always be a considerable number) who will (i) be unable      to find the cost of a reduced passage, or, if able to provide      the passage money, will be  unable  to proceed overseas      without some  additional  assistance, and (ii) be ineligible      under any special assisted passage schemes arranged with      the Dominion  Governments, His Majesty&apos;s Government in      the United Kingdom should, so far as possible, divest them-      selves of direct responsibility  for providing individual      migrants with assistance.  Departments should not,  as is      at present the case with the Ministry  of Labour trainees,      become directly responsible for individual migrants.(f) For the purpose of  carrying  out  the policy  recommended      in (e) above, the fullest possible use should be made of the      services of Voluntary  Associations,  both in  this  country      and  in the Dominions, preferably  those  with branch      organisations or with affiliations overseas.  Such organisa-      tions should,  in  any  case,  be  specially  selected  and      approved both by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United      Kingdom and  by the Dominion Government concerned.(g) The policy outlined in the foregoing conclusions cannot be      carried out within the scope of the Empire Settlement Act,      1922, which provides that the contribution  that  may be      made from  United  Kingdom funds towards the cost of      schemes arranged  under the  Act shall in no case exceed      one-half of the total expenses of such schemes.                  (b) Recommendations.43.  We summarise our recommendations as follows: (a) that  Parliament should  be invited to approve amending      legislation abolishing the statutory proportion as between      His Majesty&apos;s Government  in  the  United Kingdom  and      His Majesty&apos;s  Governments in  the Dominions  and/or      Voluntary Associations in respect of expenditure designed      to  enable  persons to migrate from this country for the      purpose  of taking up fresh occupations in the Dominions,      the expenditure included under  this heading being:         (i) passage and incidental  expenses before departure;       (ii) landing money and reasonable placing, reception, and             incidental  expenses after arrival, after-care,  etc.;       (iii) training;       (iv)  administrative  expenses   of   approved  migration             agencies.                 (NOTE. We do not suggest that His Majesty&apos;s               Government  in the   United  Kingdom  should               normally  undertake  the  whole  cost  of  sucli
services, but tluzt, in the furtherance of the policyof migration,  they  should be free  to  undertakesuch a proportion of the  expenses as may appearappropriate in any given case. We regard it as ofimportance that every effort should be made tosecure as great a degree  of financial co-operation as is possible from His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe Dominions, particularly  in  regard to thoseclasses of settlers regarded by them as speciallysuitable.)(b) that in the amending legislation recommended in (a) above,      the present principle that not more than SO per cent, of the      cost  should be  defrayed from  United  Kingdom funds      should be maintained in the case of land settlement and      development schemes subject  to His Majesty&apos;s  Govern-      ment in the United Kingdom being authorised:         (i) to take account in the calculation of the  cost of such             schemes  of contributions other than cash, e.g.,             contributions in  the form of land provided, super-             visory and administrative expenses, in such manner             as may be agreed upon by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-             ment  in  the  United Kingdom and the  Dominion             Governments or other approved settlement agencies             overseas.       (ii) to provide a larger proportion than SO per cent, of the             oapital expenditure involved in cases where schemes             provide for the payment of 50 per cent, of any loss             that may ultimately be incurred from sources other             than United Kingdom funds.(o) that as  a  condition of the grant of -the increased financial      assistance  recommended  in  (a)  above,  His  Majesty&apos;s      Governments in  the Dominions should be invited to  sub-      scribe to the following principles:         (i) that persons assisted under reduced passage schemes             (i.e., the schemes described in  paragraph 33 of this             Report)  should  (like  the  Canadian   10  rate             passengers)   continue  to  be   treated  by  His             Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions as full             fare-paying migrants;       (ii) that, so far as circumstances in the several Dominions             permit,  His  Majesty&apos;s  Governments   in   the             Dominions should  increase existing  preferential             treatment  of  British migrants  over  those from             foreign countries.(Signed)ASTOE, Chairman.A.
