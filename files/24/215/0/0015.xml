COPT NO.                                                                                 40CP.   315  (30)                                 THE CABINET.REASONS  FOR  THE  APPOINTMENT   OF   GOVERNOR  OF    BERMUDA  BEING HELD  BY  A MILITARY  OFFICER.      MEMORANDUM  BY  THE  SECRETARY  OF  STATE  FOR  WAR.     1. Bermuda is an important Naval  Base with  a  dockyard, stores,  and refitting    16facilities.   It is an important cable and wireless station.   Situated in the West Atlantic  AbroadOcean, it is 550 miles from the nearest point of the American continent and 1,100 miles   366from the West Indies.  It affords the Royal  Navy  in  time of war a secure harbour,refitting station,  and a convenient base for operations in the neighbouring seas, beingabout equidistant from Halifax and the  British  West Indies.     2. Before  the war, the garrison included 2 companies of Royal  Garrison Artillery,1 company of Royal Engineers, and an infantry battalion, in addition to ancillary troops and considerable local forces.   Since  the war, owing to financial  stringency and  in viewof the general international situation, the  fixed defences of Bermuda  have been placedtemporarily  on a care  and  maintenance basis, whilst the infantry garrison has beenreduced to 2 companies.     Political and strategical  conditions, however, are liable to change, and a deterioration in the international situation may at any time necessitate the modernization of the fixeddefences and the re-introduction of the full, garrison into Bermuda.     It is essential,  therefore, that a senior military officer he retained in command of  thetroops at Bermuda in order that he may keep up-to-date the plans for defence  and he in aposition to assume command of the garrison in the event  of war.  If the senior  military officer is removed, it will be difficult to re-introduce a senior officer without incurring the suspicion of the U.S.A.     3. Since Bermuda  is  essentially  a fortress  and has little commercial value, it seems desirable and economical to combine  the duties of the Officer Commanding the Fortresswith that of the Governor  of  the Colony.  In war, its value as a  fortress will eclipsecompletely any other colonial value it may possess, and the civil and military control ofthe islands must unquestionably he in the hands of the fortress commander, whose rank and experience must be adequate to the position which he holds.     4. Though the argument has little military significance, it is an undoubted fact thatthe  dignity  of  the position of  a  military Governor counts for much with  the manyAmerican visitors to the  island, to whom  the  opportunity of meeting  British military officers of high rank  is otherwise denied:  for  these tourists the existence of a military governor and his entourage in Bermuda is a definite attraction.     5. Finally, the  change from a military Governor to a civil Governor with a separatemilitary officer to command the troops would involve some extra  charge on Army Votes,the amount depending on  the rank fixed for the  military appointment.     It is suggested,  therefore, that there  are  not sufficient grounds for  disturbing anarrangement  which  has, I  believe, worked satisfactorily for two and a half centuries.                                                                             T.S.  THE WAR OSTICK,       27th September, 1930.(B30/17) 60 0/30 W.O.P. 5230
