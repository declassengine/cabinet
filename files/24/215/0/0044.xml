THE SINGAPORE BASE.Report by the Committee oi&apos; the Fighting Services.         The  attached memorandum by  the  Chancellor  of the    Exchequer in which  the  question  of Singapore  is examined    fr$m the  point  of view  of the United Kingdom  Exchequer    was  considered  by the Fighting Services  Committee at a    meeting on the  14th October.         The  Committee  approved generally  the  proposals contained    in the penultimate  paragraph of  the  Memorandum  and agreed    to recommend to the Cabinet that the United Kingdom Delegation    should advocate the following policy at  the Imperial conference    Sub-Committee on  Singapore which is  to meet on  October 16th           (a)  Thai  no change should be made  in  the                present policy of ultimately establishing                a defended  naval base at Singapore.           (b)   That  the Jackson Contract  should  be  continued                but that apart from  this and such expenditure                as  is necessary for  the  completion  of the air                base  on the  scale at present contemplated, the                remaining expenditure required for  completing                the equipment of the docks and for  defence                works should be postponed  for  the next five                years.   The  precise  scale  of that expenditure                should  then be determined  in the  light of the                results of  the next  Naval  Conference.         The  Committee  also  agreed that  it should be made clear    to the representatives  of the Dominions  that  the continuance    of the present  Blowing-down policy would not  prevent full    effect being given  to the complete scheme  for the  Base    when this as considered necessary.                            Signed on behalf of the  Committee                                  PHILIP  SNOvYDEN.                                     (Chairman).Whitehall Gardens ,  S. &quot;7.1. , October 14th,  1930.
DOCUMENT 18 TUB PROPERTY. OF EI3 BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;g Government&amp;jiNT)....(29)  55.CO; v&apos;  IvO               C..JUL....JL..]UU1*     SPiEIITS......ON -FIGHTING SERVICES.Memorandum by.....the Chancellor  of the Exchequer.     It  is very  important  that we should have a clear understanding  as to the  objects the British Governmentis to aim at in  regard to  the Singapore&apos; be.se before weenter upon conversations with Australia and Few Zealand.I therefore suggest that the  first essential is animmediate meeting of the.-Fighting; Services Committee;, andin order tc focus the discussion I have prepared for its consideration  the attached memorandum in which the positionis examined from the point of view of the United. kingdom excequer.(lived)S.sury Chambers3  8n&quot;f0T. October 13th.,  1930.
           For these reasons whether we abandon&apos; or continue will make little difference to the expenditure which must be borne by the United Kingdom Exchequer during . the next three years,           If the &quot;truncated scheme&quot; for the Base is to be completed lay 1937 according to present plans the cost to the United Kingdom will be at least  7-?.- millions in addition to what we have already spent.           By abandonment the United Kingdom might save between  4 millions and  5 millions spread over the years 1934-37, besides of course the further  6 millions which the Admiralty say might eventually be required to render the Base of full use in war:  but we should, have spent over  6 millions for which we should be left with assets (the Oil Fuel Depot5 the Floating Dock and Air Base) which have cost  about  2-g- millions0           None the  less there  Is  much to be said  on general grounds  for cutting our losses but  the  financial relief  is distant and I recognise that the  political difficulties would  be  serious  and that there  is no cer- tainty  that our  decision might  not be  once  more reversedby a future Government,           If however,  on balance  of considerations., it is  decided  to go on with the scheme,,  I must press, in view of  the unfavourable financial outlook, for somerelief  from the burden which the  completion of the ex-isting  scheme by 1957 would impose upon the United King-dom exchequer.ro   In existing circumstances I see no pros-pect of  obtaining increased contributions from theDominions and Colonies,,   I propose therefore that we                     - /J *-
 should attempt to secure the assent of the other Governments concerned to spreading, out the cost over  a longer period.    The-  expenditure .under the Jackson  Con- tract  cannot economically ho slowed down0    I  think that it  is  as much as  we can  afford for  the next five years together with the completion of the Air Base on the scale at present  contemplated  and that we should propose  that the remaining expenditure required  for Defence works shoulhe postponed  till  after  that period.    The  -precise  scale of that expenditure should  then he  determined in the lightof the results of  the next Naval Conference.          I do not overlook  that we have unclertaken inthe event of  a - fundamental alteration  of the scheme tomake such financial adjustment as may he agreed between ourselves and the  Government of the Federated malay states but I  think that,  if the arrangement  which i suggest secures general assent, no case would arise for modifying the existing financial arrangements regardingthe Malay contributions which it is most important forthe British Exchequer to  maintain.
