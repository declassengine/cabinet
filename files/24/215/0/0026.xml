JIHIS  DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY * S G OVERNMENT.             THE GOVERNMENT AND &quot;RATIONALISATION11.       Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     My colleagues will remember the memorandum by the Secretaryof State for tho Dominions (CP.227(30)) on industrialre-organisation which was discussed in the Cabinet on July 9th(Cab,, 38 (30) 8),   That memorandum set out certain factors which must be considered in deciding whether we as a Governmentshould take part in the process of &quot;rationalisation&quot;, and puttwo questions.   The first was whether we were to accept theresponsibility of associating ourselves with that process;  thesecond was who should carry out our policy.     No docision was taken on these questions then, and nonohas been taken since;  but that is a condition of affairs whichcannot last.   It is more and more urgently necessary that weshould decide whether the difficulties which rationalisationmust bring aro so great that we must stand aside.     If the  Cabinet are persuaded that we cannot stand aside, Iam prepared  to accept the  suggestion made by the Secretary ofStato for the Dominions that, as the work is closely  connectedwith that of the Board of Trade, I should be the minister responsible  for  carrying out that policy.SECRET.CP. 326 (30)C A BINS T.W.G.Board of Trade6th October, 1930.
