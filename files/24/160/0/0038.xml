SECRET.Copy -No.     I 3CP. 238 (S3). 991u xTHE CABINET. Home Affaiks Committee. f$WORKMEN&apos;S COMPENSATION BILL.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I desire to invite the attention of my colleagues to the prejudicial effect which the Qen jj0j g adoption of Clause 6 of the draft Workmen&apos;s Compensation Bill (OP. 225/23) may have 6780^  upon Army Regulations governing the award of disability pensions and gratuities.For instance, under Army Regulations (Article 1036 of the Pay Warrant), if a soldier is discharged from the Army on account of a disability which has resulted from misconduct or negligence, &quot;the grant, if any, of pension or gratuity shall ..... be such as Our Army Council may approve.....according to the merits of each case.&quot;If the Home Secretary&apos;s proposal be accepted that a man, who is seriously and permanently injured in doing something which he is forbidden by regulations to do, shall no longer be disqualified for an award under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, the War Office will find it difficult to apply the provisions of the Pay Warrant quoted above, and will be pressed to grant full rates of pension to soldiers who suffer disablement through their own negligence or misconduct.The words &quot; injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment&quot; -in the Workmen&apos;,? Compensation Act have their counterpart in the Pay Warrant in the words &quot; disability attributable to service &quot;, and any widening of the interpretation of the former expression will react upon the administration of Army pensions. It is especially in the case of the Territorial Army that pressure is continually being exerted on the War Office to assimilate regulations to the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act on points which favour the man, but any concessions made to the Territorial Army will have to be extended sooner or later to Regular soldiers.As a large employer of civilian labour, also, the War Department stands to lose by a relaxation of the rules in a manner which would make it difficult, I think, to exclude many undeserving cases.I am, therefore, in agreement with the Lord Chancellors opposition to the proposed clause, which I hope will be dropped.D.The War Office,10th May, 1923.(B23/140)   100  6/23   W.O.P.
