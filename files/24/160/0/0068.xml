(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty1 a Government).S SCR B T* i r*-- C A BIS KI. Copy Ho. &quot; 0CP. 269   (23)Memorandum by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.I 1.       F/hile it is obviously too early yet to dogmatise on the Budget position in 1924/25, it may be opportune to remind my i&amp;olleagues of the prospect so far as we can at present see it. Any figures givesnow must necessarily bo very tentative.        There may and probably will be variations either way,   but the general conclusion that a serious effort at further economies must be made does not seem open to doubt.2.        In 1923/24 the Budget is estimated to balance (without any allowance for Supplementary Estimates) at  8181 millions.       On the Ordinary account there is a deficit of  22^ millions, made good by a surplus on Special Account.3.        In 1924/25 the position will be worse,    (a) by the probable disappearances^ Special Receipts;     (b)   by a bad year in the 3 years average for Income Tax;     (c) by the full weight of this year!s Budget&apos;s tax concessions.        So far as estimates can at present- be framed the approximate probabilities for 1924/25 are Revenue  760 millions;     expenditure (without allowing for savings)    800 million.;?* 4. The Treasury hope to get  10 millions from a betting tax;I(though this will mean a parliamentary fight)   and have just issued a circular asking for reductions in Ordinary Supply expenditure of  30 millions. ( see Appendix A).5. This would afford a prospect of balancing the Budget in1924/25.      But it will be observed&apos;.(a)   that it allows no margin for fresh commitments in expenditure. Se have already to face  3i millions per annum for AgriculturalGrants;/
Grants;   something for Agricultural Credits;      possibly increased expenditure on the Air Force, and an increase in the   payments to Northern Ireland if the Colwyn Committee recommend a reduction in their contribution to Imperial Debts and Defence;   and(b)   that It allows no margin for fugther tax reductions*     Every ld* off the Income Tax involves  5 million reduction in expenditure&quot;6*     The moral that the Treasury would draw from this preliminary forecast is that if extreme Budget difficulties are to be avoided in 1*24/25 - even without further tax reductions - It behoves His Majesty&apos;s Government (a) to press for the full economies indicated above,   (b) to abstain from new expenditure unless met by economies Cover and ab*ve the  30 millions&apos;necessary to give a balance). 7.      The efforts to economise made in the last two years have succeeded in keeping expenditure wifthin revenue,   but their very success has encouraged a totally unfounded feeling that the pinch is now over, and that the time has come to spend&apos; The Ho^ise of Commons supplies on (toe one side pressure for expenditure and on the other a desire to make concessions. Both tendencies function piecemeal with little regard to the total effect or to the relative importance of the various items.        It is only at the moment of a Budget that a general survey Is taken.       At the next Budget the view seems likely to be bleak, unless efforts to reduce expenditure are continued and supported by all Ministers.       At present Individual Ministers are only too prone to inform the House of Commons that they can make no further economies. 8.        At the last Eleotion Mr. Bonar Law on his electionaddress
address said &quot;Every candidate in every constituency will, as I do, make retrenchment an essential part of his programme&quot;. The Government will Inevitably be reminded of this declaration by the electorate.W.j.h.Treasury Chambers,Whitehall. 11.6.23.
APPENDIX A.TREASURY CHAMBERS,P. 6188.WHITEHALL, S.W.I.1st June, 1923,CONFIDENTIALSir,I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of HisMajesty&apos;s Treasury to Invite particular attention to the Budget Statement on 16th April last In the course of which the Chancellor of the Exchequer emphasised on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government the need for still further reductions In public expenditure!2,     In one passage Mr.Baldwin said &quot;I wish ajso tQ make it clear that In my proposals I count on the full support of hon. Members in obtaining still further substantial reductions in Supply expenditure. YJhen Chancellors ofthe Exchequer speak at Budget time &amp;bmxt reductions in /taxation, they have always the enthusiastic support of   the Cemmlttee. I want some of that enthusiasm preserved forother occasions, when hon. Members are apt to forget the close connection expenditure and the taxpayers&apos; burden.      The Government are anxious to make reductions, and the country expects them, and I hope that hon. Members will do their part. Reductions, and substantial reductions, are essential, not merely in special war services which are now dwindling almost automatically, but also in normal services where they are more difficult to obtain.        Taxpayers who welcome reduced taxes must not forget that these reductions are only the fruit of reduced expenditure&quot;.
3.       The Supply Estimates of 1923/24 amount to  4201 millions Ordinary Expenditure^pid  15s millions Special Expenditure.        My Lords count on the cessation by 1924/25 of Special Expenditure but it will be necessary in addition that substantial reductions- should be made in Ordinary Expenditure.      In 1924/25 special revenue which is estimated to produce  40 millions this year will be small (if any) and a bad   year will come into the 3 years average for Income Tax&apos;, further the effect of the remissions of   taxation given this year will be felt with greater weight than in the current year* Every effort in economy will therefore be needed in order to balance the budget in 1924/25 on the basis of taxation as proposed for the current year-4*&quot;      It is hardly necessary to point out that to increase taxation when the emphatic demand of the taxpayer is for reduction is practically impossible.5.      I. am to observe that a comparison of the actual expenditure for 1922/23 with the provision which Departments asked Parliament to vote seems to suggest that the estimates in &quot;certain cases contain very considerable margins above necessary expenditure.6.      His Majesty1s Government wish to effect for 1924/25a reduction on the.ordinary Supply Expenditure of this yearamounting to not less than  50 millions   i.e. from  420I millionsmillionsfor 1923/24 down to  390/for next year.Even on this reduced basis the ordinary Supply Services for 1924/25 would cost (exclusive of War Pensions) about  320 millions as compared with the pre-war( 191.4/15) figure of  170 millions, representing an increase of approximately 90$.        This in conjunction with the vastly larger debt liabilities (estimated for 1923/24 at  350 millions as against an audited expenditure of  24^ millions in 1913/14&apos;) and with the expenditure on WarPensions
Pensions involves too. heavy a burden on the taxpayer.7.    My Lords will be glad if you will supply Them on or before the 15th July next with an estimate of the expenditure for 1924/25 of your Department. Theseprovisional Estimates will be examined in this Department andif it is deemed advisable will be referred to a special Committee of the Cabinet. In framing these estimates for 1924/25 Departments may provisionally take cost of living bonus for -that year on the basis of an Increase of 80% over the pre-war level. The Estimates shouldindioate (a) the approximate variation resulting from 5 points change in the cost of living figure (b)   the. . assumed prices of the main commodities (where these are a considerable factor in the Estimate).I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sd) .
