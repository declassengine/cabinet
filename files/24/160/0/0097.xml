[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet   June 1-923.SECRET.CP. 299 (23).(Also Paper No. N.D. 58.)1sCABINET.THE RELATIONS OF THE ARMY AND THE ROYAL AIR FORCE.Memorandum by the Chairman of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on National and Imperial Defence.I HAVE been asked by the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on National and Imperial Defence to submit to the Cabinet their Conclusions on the subject of the Relations of the Army and the Royal Air Force in advance of the final Report of the Sub-Committee.The Secretary of State for War recently circulated to the Sub-Committee a Memorandum by the General Staff (Paper N.D. 40) on this question, and I understand that he intends to circulate the relevant portions to the Cabinet.&apos;&quot;&apos;&apos;The views of the General Staff are contained in Part I of that Memorandum and are summarised on p. 4 in the following terms : &quot; (a.) The air units which are an integral part of the Fleet and Air formations (including probably lighter-than-air formations) capable of co-operating with the Fleet on the high seas to be under the Admiralty.&quot; (b.) The air units which are an integral part of Army formations and Air formations required to co-operate with the Army (including Air Forces allotted to the general pool for war and to home defence) to be under the War Office.&quot;(c.) Civil aviation, research, experiment and supply to be under the Air Ministry, which, relieved of all responsibility for the employment of Air Forces in peace and war, could be much reduced.&quot;Each of the three Departments (Naval, Military and Civil) would estimate for its own air requirements, the whole being co-ordinated by the Committee of Imperial Defence before presentation to Parliament.&quot;The view of the Sub-Committee was to the effect that the above distribution of responsibility was unsatisfactory and that if the Air Forces of this country were to be developed to the utmost, it was necessary to retain the Royal Air Force as a separate service, and that progress would not be so great if the War Office proposals were adopted.   The conclusion of the Sub-Committee was : &quot; That they were unable to accerjt the views expressed by the General Staff in Part I of their Paper (N.D. 40).&quot; &apos;The Secretary of State for War asked,that his dissent from this conclusion might be recorded, and he further stated that he proposed to record his dissent when the matter came up for consideration by the Cabinet, and also to state his reasons for so doing.(Initialled)S.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, June 30, 1923.* (Jirculated to the Cabinet as CP 296 (23).[10239]
