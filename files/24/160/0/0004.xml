&apos;..... 5J[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]Secret. Copy Kb.___UL--].P. Eo. 204 (25). ICABIMET.Importation of Canadian Breeding.Cattle.Memorandum by. the Minister of Agriculture, and Fisheries.I have now consulted the various breed societies with regard to the framing of an Order- to admit Canadian breeding cattle.     They are unanimous in condemning any such Order, however   safeguarded.     The Agricultural Advisory Committee for England and Wales, appointed under the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Act 1919, take the same view, and refuse to give any&apos;opinion on the details of an Order as they are so strongly opposed to it on principle.Ihe only reason why it is necessary to lay the Order is that my predecessor,  in his conference with the Canadians, promised that he would do so, although he declined to put it in the Bill, on the grounds that he thought it improbable that.he&apos; would, be able to carry it.     He undertook to put it in an Order and said &quot;We think those are the lines upon which we should draft the Order and we should feel it to be our duty in both Houses to defend it on those lines.     fre should make it a Government matter.&quot;     My predecessor having said thatj I am afraid that if the Order is not laid, we shduld again be accused by the Canadians of a breach of faith.     This pledge was given on October 18th, 1922, the day before the Carlton meeting, but in the communication made to the Press on the 3rd. November, regarding the decisions of the Conference, it was stated that a general Order, admitting breeding cattle, would be laid.1.
I am informed that it is very doubtful if such anOrder would be carried in the house of Lords, and though Ithink we might carry it in the bouse of Commons, it would beby the support of our political opponents apa Inst a large bodyof our own supporters.Three courses are possible:-(1) To lay the Order&apos; and support it;(2) To lay it and not put on Government Whips;(3) To postpone the whole matter till the Imperial conference in the autumn.In view of all the circumstances I would recommendthat the third course be adopted.R. A. S.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 20th April,  1923.
