[This Docunmtjsj^e Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.j    ^Printed for the Cabinet. j /I. QSECRET. \&apos;;!CP. 224 (23).CABINET.PROPOSED - COMMERCIAL  TREATY WITH BRAZIL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I HAVE read the Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade as to a proposed Commercial Agreement with Brazil, under which an undertaking would be given to Brazil that during the currency of the Agreement no import duties would be imposed in the United Kingdom on certain Brazilian products.I recognise the importance to British trade of an Agreement securing for United Kingdom products most-favoured-nation treatment in Brazil, and I am aware that in previous cases, viz., Japan and Spain, we have given concessions similar in principle to those proposed in the present case, but it appears to me desirable that, before coming to a decision, the Cabinet should take into account the effect which would be produced on the minds of the Dominion Governments by the proposed Agreement, having regard to the forthcoming Imperial Economic Conference. The products in respect of which it is proposed to give an undertaking to Brazil include meat, lard and hides, all of which are of interest to the Dominions, as well as cotton, which is of interest to both the Dominions and the Colonies, and raw rubber, which is of interest to the Colonies.It has been suggested that the Agenda of the Imperial Economic Conference should include the question of mutual co-operation among the various Governments to safeguard their economic interests in relation to foreign countries or for promoting international arrangements for the more equitable treatment of commerce.Moreover, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia has announced his intention of pressing at the Conference for some further preference in favour of Dominion products in the United Kingdom, and it seems quite possible that at the Conference some of the Dominions (particularly Australia) may urge upon His Majesty&apos;s Government a policy of Empire development by admitting Dominion products free of duty while taxing foreign products. An indication of this possibility is to be found in a recent protest by Australia against the proposed duty on malting barley on the ground, that it would adversely affect- Australian produce. If the above surmise is correct, meat and meat products will certainly play a prominent part in the campaign. . At the Imperial War Conferences of 1917 and 1918 Resolutions were passed in favour of the development of Imperial meat supplies. The same question -has come up since the war, and, in particular, Australia and New Zealand constantly contend, rightly or wrongly, that South American meat is preferred in the United Kingdom to their own beef and mutton.It is true, of course, that the competing South American meat comes at present almost exclusively from the Argentine. Since, however, Argentine produce is entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment here, the effect of the proposed concession to Brazil would be to preclude the possibility of discriminating against Argentine meat.It might be awkward for the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government to have to say, at the Imperial Economic Conference, that this position was the result of a Treaty concluded only a few months back, unless it had been deliberately agreed beforehand that a policy of taxing imported foreign meat was ruled out by
the pledge given by the Prime Minister last autumn &quot; that this Parliament will not make any fundamental change in the fiscal system of this country.&quot;As regards the inclusion of raw rubber in the list of articles in respect of which the proposed undertaking is given, I would point out that, although it is extremely unlikely that there will be any question of imposing an import duty in the near future, the attitude of the Dutch Government towards proposals for co-operation in schemes for restoring the British rubber-growing industry makes it undesirable to enter without the fullest consideration into engagements which would by implication relieve that Government of any anxiety as to the possible treatment of Dutch rubber in this country.I gather that, apart from Brazil, the only important South American countries where we do not enjoy mdst-favoured-nation treatment are Chile and Peru.(Signed)        DEVONSHIRE.Colonial Office,May 1, 1928.
