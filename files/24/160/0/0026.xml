SECRET.The negotiations with the Marconi Wireless Company have advanced a stage further since CP. 206 (25) wa3 circulated. I desire the deoision of the Cabinet before I proceed any further.It will be remembered that the Cabinet&apos; decided to erect a station in Great Britain, but to give,- at the same time, freedom to private enterprise.     After some little negotiation and, perhaps I might add? fencing; the Marconi Company have now in a letter dated 27th April 1923 applied to me for a general licence for the following six stations to be situated close to Avebury in Wiltshires-Station &quot;A&quot;; Rating in metre-amperes ..Proposed wave-length Height of masts .,Station &quot;B&quot;; Rating in metre-amperes ..Proposed wave-length      ..

Station 11F&quot;: Rating in met re-amp ere a85,000Proposed wave-length10,700 metresHeight of masts800 feet.These, stations have a combined metre-amperage of something like 800,000.     The Government station, with the increased power and the 16 masts for which I am asking authority, will have a metre-amperage of some 250,000.I understand from the Marconi Company that it is proposed to utilise some of these six stations in combination so as to make one or more very powerful stations when it may bo necessary to use the greatest power.The request for the general licence asks for permission to communicate with Australia, South Africa.- India, 0 anada, United states of America, South America; China and Japan,They already have other stations at Ongar in Essex whioh communicate with Europe.It is quite obviouB that, if a licence is granted for this enormous group of stations with permission to cpmmunioate with every known country In the world, a monopoly would be established,I should like to add.that the monopoly is not really that of the Marconi Company, as evidence ia accumulating that the controlling mind is that of the American Radio Corporation, whioh has entered into a combine with the Marconi Company here, the Telefunken Company in Germany and the French Radio Company in Paris.     This is known as the &quot;A.E.F.G.&quot;     Mr. E..J. Nally of New York, the late.President of the Radio Corporation of America? has now been appointed by that Company Managing Director of International Relations, with Headquarters in Paris.     A Japanese Radio Corporation has
mjust been formed in Japan, in affiliation with the American Radio Corporation, and is seeking exclusive rights from the Japanese Government.     In Sweden and Poland contracts have been made between the respective Governments and the Radio Corporation of America for large Btations.     At Stavanger, in Norway, a high-power station is, it is understood, being operated under the auspices of the Radio Corporation and the Marconi Company.     In Denmark the Telefunken Company is trying to obtain a contract to erect a station.     In. Brazil the Combine propoae to erect three large stations and have nearly completed a super-station in the Argentine; and, of course, tho Marconi Company will be in direct communication, If our licence is granted, with all these stations, and others to be built by the Combine,1   (Signed) W.
