cis[This Document is the Property of His Britanmc iWajesty&apos;s Government]Printed for the: Cabinet.   April .1923.CONFIDENTIAL.[W 2372/1410/98]I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum on a proposed amendment of article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.C. op K.MEMORANDUM.This article, dealing with the application of the economic boycott to a Covenant-breaking State, imposes upon the members of the League the obligation to prohibit intercourse between their nationals and those of the Covenant-breaking State. Ever since the League of Nations came into being there has been a movement on foot to amend article 16 and impose on members the obligation to prohibit intercourse, in case the economic boycott has to be applied, between persons resident in their territory and persons resident in the Covenant-breaking State instead of between their nationals and those of the Covenant-breaking State. In 1921 an amendment was adopted by the Second Assembly for that purpose, and a series of resolutions were also adopted as to the action which Governments were recommended to take if the case should arise for an economic boycott to be applied before the amendments to article 16 came into force. Among these resolutions was one recommending the observance of the amendment in question, among others, pending their ratification. France did not like the amendment or the corresponding resolution, but did not vote against them, and, in fact, accepted the resolution, which was-merely a recommendation without binding force. Since then it has become plain that Prance will not accept the proposed amendment to article 16, and the amendment cannot come into operation until it has been ratified by Prance (see article 26 of the Covenant). An inter-Departmental Committee was appointed in this country to consider the situation, and reported, on the 1st February, 1922, in favour of the ratification by the British Empire of the amendment as adopted in 1921, but suggested another line to follow in case Prance refused to accept the amendment. Since then conversations have taken place intermittently with the Legal Adviser to the French Foreign Office with a view to arriving at an understanding on the point.The French Government are now prepared to accept the annexed text. It will necessitate the abandonment of the first amendment to article 16 adopted by the Assembly in 1921, and the substitution of a new amendment in place thereof. As there is no chance of bringing the earlier amendment into force, this result, though it is unfortunate, cannot be avoided. If approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government the new text should be submitted to the Governments of the Dominions, and, if approved by them, must be put forward as a new amendment at the meeting of the Assembly in September. The amendment follows the lines approved by the inter-Departmental Committee mentioned above, that is to say, it leaves each of the members of the League enforcing the economic boycott liberty to apply a prohibition of intercourse with the Covenant-breaking State to all its nationals, but obliges it as a minimum to enforce such prohibition on persons resident within its territory.The text of paragraph 1 of article 16 as it stands at present is also attached.The English version of the new text is not perhaps as elegant as it might be; it is drafted so as to involve the least alteration necessary in the existing text, which seems desirable in order to make acceptance as easy as possible.Foreign Oljiac,April 20, 1923.1508 [9852]
