In his paper, N.D. 37, the Secretary of State for Air has accepted the, standard of 596 French aeroplanes (the strength of the Division Aerienne to-day) as the basis on which our relative strength should, in the first instance, he calculated, and from that basis he has arrived at the conclusion that we shall, for the first stage of our expansion, require 52 squadrons (39 regular) of 594 machines (450 regular).This conclusion is formed on the following assumptions I (a) A 3-4 ratio of first line machines with first line French machines (para-graph 1 (a)).(b) A 3-4 ratio of  British regular squadrons  with  French squadrons (para-graph 5 (a)).(c) Equality (594-596) in machines of all types (regular cadre and auxiliary) with french machines.N.B.-No allowance is made for the normal expansion on outbreak of war of British squadrons from a peace strength of 12 machines to a war strength of 1.8.2. Although the General Staff stated in their paper, N.D. 31, that 596 French machines should be the basis &quot; for giving whatever standard of air strength our Government consider should be maintained,&quot; they pointed out that this standard &quot; need not necessarily be stated in terms of aeroplanes alone.&quot;3, To arrive at sound conclusions, we must he satisfied that our strength of aeroplanes, together with our other defensive measures, and our means&quot; of retaliation, are sufficient to prevent even the most warlike French Government from embarking on such an undertaking as the bombing of London.4. It will perhaps make the problem a little simpler if we look at it for a moment from the point of view of the French General Staff, and consider what questions they must put to themselves before embarking on an undertaking from which, as pointed out i in the previous Genera! Staff paper (N.D. 31), no final results can be expected. It is 1 suggested that the following are some of the questions that the French General Staff / would have to consider before they could launch their &apos;&quot; Division Aerienfie &quot; against ( Londom . - - i\ .   &apos; h&apos;J&apos;p(4. ?v:iv 1&apos;&apos;;&apos;;&apos;.&apos; ^vJvyfttfcww ^^Si;&apos;1!^;     I(a) What proportion of our aeroplanes are we likely to lose in these, :raids.-. on    \ London, in aerial comhat with the British fighting planes, from anti-aircraft fire, from entanglement in nets or aprons ?.- .: &amp;*jm u.y:   &apos; /, *(B23/162)   100  ti/23  W-.O.P.  010 : &quot;...
(b) What number can we afford to lose in view of the position on our eastern frontier, and the possible eventual recovery of Germany ?*;  ,.: &apos; */(c) Can our fighting squadrons give our bombing squadrons the protection thevrequire throughout this enterprise ?* -(d) What retaliatory action are the British likely to take (if against our Northernports, Northern industrial towns, or even Paris, with their bombing planes ; (ii) against our Western and Southern ports and neighbouring towns with their Navy and carrier-borne&apos; aircraft ; (iii) against our shipping and overseas trade ; (iv) against our Colonies ?(e) What will be the effect of this retaliation on our people and on public opinion ?5&quot;. To revert to the British point of view-^we must have sufficient aerial strength to be certain that the French General Staff will assure their Government that the enterprise is not worth the risks involved.The Air Staff have assessed this air strength as practical equality with France, and have suggested expansion that will cost the country many millions in initial expenditure, and many more millions annually.Could not more be done from existing resources to: meet the menace they foresee ? Their solution of the problem is to form and maintain a large number of new formations :t.o, meet an eventuality which, to, say the least of it, is highly problematical. The General Staff are of opinion that the problem requires careful consideration from two aspects-Firstly : The means required to meet and defeat the raiding air forces, i.e., the defensive measure which will provide the necessary deterrent owing to risk of casualties. These means are fighting aircraft and A.A. guns, searchlights and other forms of defence.Secondly: The counter-offensive measures, i.e., the deterrent owing to fear of reprisals which are provided by bombing aircraft and by the Navy and naval aircraft, not only against coastal towns and ports, but also against hostile trade and shipping. In our Navy we have an.immense power of retaliation, a factor that the Air Staff do not appear to have taken into consideration.6. Although the General Staff are not, owing to the separation of the Air arm from the Army, as closely in touch with details of Air matters as they would like to be, and as they ought to be, they offer the following suggestions : Could riot sufficient economies be effected to provide,, with less additional expense, than that foreshadowed, an adequate deterrent to any Power contemplating independent air operations against this country ? e.g.: (a) By the amalgamation of Royal Air Force schools with existing Army schools of the same type ;(b)- By the re-organization of the instructional staff of the flying schools on the basis that, on mobilization, each should be capable of mobilizing two or three fighting squadrons ;(c) By the abolition of certain headquarters and. establishments and by the. reduction of the very large staffs at others.7. The General Staff believe that no great initial outlay is necessary to provide sufficient forces for counter-offensive and retaliation. Our first means of retaliation is the Navy, which, if London were bombarded from the air, would presumably be. entitled to retaliate against any French, port or coastal town in which there might be a military garrison or factory for the manufacture of. warlike stores. This would he supplemented fey any existing bombing squadrons, reinforced possibly by the personnel of the Army co-operation squadrons, if the Expeditionary Force, were still at. home, phis the whole of the Auxiliary Air units, which, we, feel should row be organized, on, a Territorial basis from the existing resources of civil aviation.The above is but an outline of a. scheme which the General Staff consider should provide sufficient deterrents to secure safety for this country from the likelihood of air bombardment. Other measures such as operations against. French colonies and French trade are beyond the scope, of this paper, bat are obvious. It. is understood that France is by no means self-supporting, but is, on the contrary, dependent on sea-borne supplies for certain vital commodities. Doubtless, full details on this subject can be obtained from the admiralty* N.B.-The latest information obtained by the General. Staff tends to show that tlie radius of aotion of the French fighters is very limited indeed, and they are not. designed to undertake flights far away from their bases. This condition, so long as it lasts, very considerably reduces the existing &quot;menace.&quot; as no less than 300 of the 596 machines in the Division Aerienne are fighters.
8. While the General Staff fully concur that the number of squadrons at home is at present inadequate, they consider that the contingency of air attack by France is remote, and though we must be ready to meet it, it is believed that some-more economical method can be found than the maintenance of a large number of regular service squadrons for the sole purpose of meeting a contingency which it is hoped will never occur. The Air Force have a very large number of highly-trained flying officers in existence and a very large number of aeroplanes in reserve, and the General Staff cannot but believe that an efficient and economical organization can be devised, whereby the requirements of training and instruction can be met in peace, which would on mobilization provide a number of squadrons manned by highly skilled pilots (viz., those engaged in instruction and training), and which would by its very existence, added to the latent power oi the Royal Navy, provide the necessary deterrent to sudden attack by any foreign Power, and satisfy the anxieties of our own people.9. The General Staff repeat their conviction that Home Defence is a single problem to be solved by the whole of our available forces and resources, and not by the sudden sexpansion of a single arm.
