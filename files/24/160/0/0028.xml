Copy Ho.    \ *HDUCATIQH   BILL.,    3.925.MBtQRAMDUB BY THE PKESIEEHT Off THE BO ARB OJ EDUCATION.1.    A Special Committee of the Cabinet considered on 2nd February, 1923, the Economy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill of last Session and deoided first that certain educational clauses contained in that Bill should he revived in a new Bill and secondly that the educational provisions for England, Wales and Scotland should be comprised In a single Bill.    Their Report was confirmed T*y the Home AffairB Committee of the Cabinet on 7th February) and the present Bill gives effeot to their recommendations and also contains some olaueee which were not then under consideration.3.     Since the preparation of the Bill I have been in communication with the Whips who attach great importance to a reduction in the volume of legislation for the present Session, and if such a reduction were a paramount consideration, I should be prepared, so far as england alone is concerned, to abandon all the English clauses of the present Bill except Clauses 7 and 8, dealing with poor law and institution children.   Clauses 7 and 8 are designed to deal with an admitted grievance.   The Associations concerned with education have devoted much attention to the subject and I have every reason to think that the clauses will prove to be unoontroversial and that keen disappointment would be oocasioned if they were abandoned.3.     In expressing this view, however, I ought to say thatthere are various weighty reasons which I shall presently mentionIfor retaining some ether clauses of the Bill.4.     I do not know whether or not it is essential to-pass the Scottish clauses, namely Clauses 10 and 11, I regard
Clauee 10 as a Scottish olause because though it in terms applies is England it ie in fact diotated solely by the needs of Scotland.   If, however, any Scottish clauoea have to be retained I must point out that it ie practically impossible on any intelligible principle to frame a Bill Which deals solely(a) with poor law and institution children in England and(b) with certain matters in Scotland.   The Bill would be of too heterogeneous a oharacter to justify its introduction, and consequently a decision to include any Scottish clauses would involve the inclusion of some *r all of the clauses at present oontained in the Bill.     On the assumption, therefore, that the Bill is to contain Scottish clauses it is necessary to consider whioh English clauses should be retained and in doing sn I will mention the reasons whioh might be adduced for their retention in any event.5.     Clause 1 provides that both in England and Scotland children shall not be required to attend school before the age of 6.     I understand that Scotland do not attach much importance to the clause and the financial importance of the olause in England is ntt considerable.   The immediate financial saving involved is insignificant and the ultimate financial saving to the Exchequer cannot be exactly estimated, but it might in course of time amount ta half a million a year.   It embodies a recommendation cf the Geddes Committee in a milder form and as such is perhaps&apos;important from the point of view of the Treasury. The olause is undoubtedly controversial, but there ia an educational argument for it in addition to the financial argument.     Of all the oontroverBial clauses of the Bill it is the olause which might most easily be sacrificed if it were desired to lighten the Bill.
6.   Clause 2 raises a constitutional- issue.    A system of oompulaory Continuation Schools has been established by law in London and a few other places, but the obligation to establish those schools has been disregarded with the connivance of the Board of Education.      The existing state of affairs is entirely illegal and the Board of Education are responsible for the illegality.   Clause 2 while it does not attempt to validate the past illegality causes the Illegality to come to an endt and allows the system of compulsory Continuation Schools to be suspended.   It can be argued with some force that this admitted disregard of the law by a Government Department constitutes a dangerouB precedent and may be productive of administrative difficulties in future. On the other hand there is a general acquiescence in the illegality, and the debate upon Clause 2 will be principally used as an occasion for general indictment of the Governments education policy.   There is therefore considerable reason for introducing this clause in any event, but the question is not confined to the merits of the Clause.      It would scarcely be possible to construct a Bill which dealt solely with two such different subjeots as Continuation Schools and poor law and institution children,   and therefore if the Clause is retained it is almost unavoidable that other clauses should be retained in order to put the Bill into reasonable form.      The clause would undoubtedly expose wide surface to attack and is likely to give rise to prolonged debate, but if there is a general 3iucation Bill it is scarcely possible to exclude Clause 2 from it.7.   Clause 3 contains Borne controversial elements though it would probably receive general support.     The L.E.A&apos;s will probably move amendments to extend its operation, and will be disappointed if they get no chance of doing so,   It is not of the first importance and it might be dropped.,   If, however, it is introduced at all it should be proceeded with.3.
8.   Glauses 4, 5 and 6 are probably not controvertthough, there is some doubt as to Clauso 4.   They could be dropped without any serious damage if they were objected to in Committee;   but if there is a general Bill they should probably be retained for the present.9.   Clauses 7 and 8 have already been mentioned and are regarded as necessary.10.   Clause 9 is probably uncontroversial.   It does not raise a very important point and it might be dropped, and those who are in favour of the clause might be invited to move it on their own account if they thought fit.11.   The alternatives therefore, so far as England andWales are concerned, appear to be either -(&apos;a) to confine the Bill to Clauses 7 and 8; or(b) to have a Bill which includes Clauses 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 and possibly Clauses 1 and 3.view of the state of public business to accept alternative (a), but if there are to be any scotch Clauses in the Bill it seems necessary to adopt alternative (b).12.   I should add that I have been asked by the County Councils Association to introduce a Bill in such a form that certain amendments can be made which the County Councils Association desire, and at the time when a General Education Bill was contemplated I Baid that these amendments could be moved,   if alternative (a) is adopted I shall have to explain that the time at the disposal of the Government has made it impossible in the present session to introduce a Bill which afforded facilities for a general amendment of the education law.As regards England and Wales, I should be vailing in
