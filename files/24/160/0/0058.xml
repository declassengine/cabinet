THIS DOCUMENT 13 THEPROPERTY Off HIS BRIT ANN 10,, MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.o a b i g e To   . / ;:Budget of the International labour Offioe, 19-24. CP. 229/1923$   CaP. 257/1923).MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER QF 1AB0UR.BOHBI. At the last meeting of the Governing Body of the.P.58 International labour Offioe the Budget Estimates of the1923).Offioe for 1924 were reduced from 9,, 118,780 Swiss franos, originally suggested by the Offioe, to 7,050,600 Swiss       &quot; f franos, largely as a result of the efforts made by Mr, Betterton, parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of labour, who represented with skill and ability the British Government at the meeting of the Governing Body. It was understood that the sum of 4,426,600 Swiss franos included for staff (equal to the sum actually expended in 1922) was adopted provisionally and that the Direotor would present to the Governing Body at its meeting on -the 12th June next proposals for a reduotion of this expenditure based on a re-organisation of the staffing of the Offioe.     The figure of 7,050,600, though it represented a very considerable reduotion, was not accepted by the British Government representative, in vie?/ of the fact that it was still in excess of the sum of 6,250,000 francs which the Cabinet decided on the 28th Maroh should be the maximum sum for the effective budget of the Office for which Mr* Betterton should vote.The Direotor of the International labour Office has now prepared a revised Budget, which is summarised in the table below.     For convenience of comparison, a summary of the Budget provisionally adopted in April is also given in tabular forme- 1 -
Subheads.	provisional Budget adopted in inril.	Director&apos;s revised proposals.Material Subheads	8,274,000	2,274,000Staff	4,426,600	4,418,415Unforeseen expenditure	100,000	350,000Expenditure upon repatriation etc of staff discharged.	250,000	-250,000Total	7,050,600	7,292,415The Director	, M. Thomas, and the As	sistant Director,Mr. Butler, were	in London last week, an	d I hud an interview with them.   Neither set of figures, as I pointed out to the Director, appear to take sufficiently into account the representations as to the need for economy which were made by Mr. Betterton at tho April Session of tho Govorning Body.     fe had a long discussion, in which l\U Thomas explained the political and personal difficulties involved in his accepting the drastic revision proposed by the British representative, but he also expressed his desire to do all in his power to meet the views of the British Government, and to co-operate with our representative.     Eventually, we agreed provisionally on a figure of 6f million franos, i.e. I would ask tho Cabinet to authorise the Government representative at the next meeting of tha Governing Body at Geneva to go as far as 6-g- million francs, and, if the British Government agreed to this, the Director agreed to support this figure of 6-^- million francs before the Finance Committee and the Governing Body.I refused to discuss with Mo Thomas how this figure of 6-g- million francs was to bo arrived at, that being a question for the DIroctor and the Finance Committee; but it is to be an inclusive figure, and to cover
everything (including material subheads of salaries of staff and unforeseen expenditure), exoept expenditure to be incurred on repatriation, whtoh Is not reourrlng and is not a large item.It was understood, on both sides, that if the Gabinet were not prepared to accept the compromise figure of 6% million francs, M. Thomas would be free to maintain his Budget of 7,292,415 francs, while, on the other hand, the British Government representative would be at liberty to oppose this Budget and press for economy.A  Budget of     million franos would be only 250,000 franos in excess of that for which the Cabinet have already   authorised Mr. Betterton to vote (cabinet Conclusions 17/23, Minuto 6), and would be over million franos less than the original estimate prepared by the Of floe.     With so muoh already aohioved, I should regard It as unfortunate if Great Britain were to alienate feeling on the Governing Body by appearing to be niggling over a sum of tout 250,000 franos, of whioh only one-tanth ( 1,000), falls to toe paid toy the British Government,     I understand that the British Employers&apos; representative and the Canadian Government representative who have bo far supported the line taken by Mr.Betterton, are of opinion that, In view of the very great economies already secured, it would toe wise to mako the concession not a vary large one - on the lines proposed atooye.   It Is desirable not to lose the support of those who have so far co-operated with Mr. .3otterton in the polloy of economy.I suggest, therefore, that, if an effective Budget of 6  million franc3, as explained above, is presented,
-    35.5and the Director supports it, tho British Government representative at Geneva should accept it.The Treasury have heen consulted, and are in agreement.    Unless any of my colleagues dissent I propose to instruct Mr, Betterton accordingly.(Intd)   M. BeMinistry of Labour,2nd June, 1923,
