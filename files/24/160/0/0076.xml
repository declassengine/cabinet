The results of the campaign have, however, bean quite out *f proportion to the effort and expense involved. .Further speciments of recent Russian propaganda against the British Govtrament are quoted in this report..Extracts are given from on important resolution on &quot;anti-militarism&quot; passed by the Fourth International Bureau Session of the Young Communist International:     this dooument contains frank instructions to the Young Communist Leagues *f Great Britain and other countries to undertake revolutionary propaganda amtng the armed Feroes.
ASIAN PROPAGANDA AGAINST TUB BRITISH GOVERNMENT,4    Last weak Russian organisations issued manifestoes and resolutions on the Anglo-Russian situationy   some specimens of which are reproduced in the issue of the &quot;International Press Correspondence&quot; for June 7th:   extracts from the so are given below.(1)     &quot;&apos;J!he Petrograd Soviet on the War Danger&quot;   -   &quot;To theWorkers of all countries and the Workers of England inparticular.&quot;&quot;The Petrograd Soviet has discussed the question of the ultimatum sent by Lord Curzon to the Soviet-Government, and declares:&quot;The workers of petrograd, and - we are convinced - the working messes of ell other peoples as well - have read the ultimatum of the English imperialists with indignation,     For five hard years we have been fighting to protect the existence of Soviet Russia from the numerous attacks of internal and external counter-revolution...      ind now, just as we are in the midst of the work of reconstructing the economy ruined by war and intervention, now that we have overcome the famine, now that the wounds dealt us in the attacks of the imperialists, among whom the imperialists of England hare invariably played a leading part; are at, last about to heal -now, like a belt from the blxie, appears a fresh ultimatum.   The ruling circles of English imperialism have forgotten that Soviet Russia dce-s not permit herself to be addressed, in the language of ultimatums, that the federation of Soviet Republics is no Ruhr area, that our workers&apos; and peasants&apos; government is not at the mercy of the foreign governments which have done their best to rain it, &quot;but is founded solely on the united endeavours and the determined will of the working masses of the great Soviet federation...&quot;lord Curzon... accuses our country of not refraining from determined measures of self-defence    , against spies, even when these hide their real calling under priestly vestments.   In lord Curzon&apos;s words, this is not persecution of spies, but persecution of religion.   The insignificant occurrence of the holding up of fishing vessels, which had penetrated illegally into our waters, has been shamefully exaggerated into a hostile act.   The real import of the ultimatum is clear.   It is either an attempt to institute a frs-sh blockade of soviet Russia, just as she is beginning to recover from the injuries caused by the first, or it is the precursor of an opendeclai-ation/
declaration of war.   Our mere existence is a crime in the eyes of this irreconcilable representative of imperialism.   Ana out greatest culpability lieB in the fact that vra are mastering all our difficulties, that we have begun to improve our economy, that we have not permitted Russia to be converted into a colony or a semi-colony and that we have offered successful resistance to the excessive appetite of Urquhart and other &quot;concessionaries .&quot;The shots fired at comrade Vorovsky light up the situation.   That which the most irreconcilable sections of international imperialism are now planning is nothing less than the beginning of a fresh campaign against the Russian revolution.   The campaign against the Ruhr area, the ultimatum sent by Curzon, the murder cf Comrade Vorovsky, the triumphal entry of General Poch into Poland, the provocatory preparations of the Polish government, the oeremonious visit of an English commission tc Roumania, the inexorable determination of world cap.ita7u.sm to deprive the workers of all countries of economic rights and liberties already won---all these are links in one and the same ohain.&quot;let the English imperialists, and the imperialists of the whole world, learn that there is no power capable of overcoming our soviet Russia.   We fear the threats of no imperialist government whatever.   We can afford to laugh at attempts to frighten a country which has been the Object of so many attacks during the past 5 years, and which has rspulsed them all successfully.   We declare that any attei-ipt to threaten us with war or intervention will be the signal for 10 millions of our adult population to spring to arms ready to fight to the last drop of blood against the foreign invader.   Woe to those who dare to attack a great people like ours, after all the sufferings it has gone through, and force it to abandon its peaceful work again.&quot;From the Council of people&apos;s Commissaries we categorically demand, that it rejects Lord Ci.rzon&apos;fc ultimatum absolutely.&quot;We appeal to the workers of all countries:   A fresh oampaign is being opened against Soviet Russia.   In this campaign the victory, or even the semi-victory, of world imperialism would signify the annihilation of the labour mo-movement for many years, and the prevalence of blackest reaction.&quot;We appeal to the English workers, upon whose shoulders an immense historical responsibility rests.   We are confident that the English workers will do their utmost to prevent the present rulers of England from unchaining the dogs of war in Europe again.&quot;The workere^peasants, and toilers of every description in Russia will do their duty to the full.   This v/e guarantee to the English workers.   We call upon them to fulfil their duty too.   Down with the instigators of new imperialist warsi long live the struggle of the International proletariat for peaoe and the workers&apos; government.&quot;The Chairman of the petrograd Soviet of Workers&apos; bx&amp; Peasants&apos; Deputies:   Einoviev.&quot;[2)1
(2)   &quot;Moscow Soviet mi War Danger&quot;.(a) &quot;To all yrade Union orgsnisatlona of the Workers,to all Workeret&quot;&quot;The Moscow Soviet, representing the. whole working class of Moscow, and expressing, oooa^ointly with the leaders of the trade unions, the wishes Of hundreds of meetings, and of the demonstration of thai half million human beings surrounding at this moment&quot; the building in which the Soviet is in session, appeals to the workers of the whole world, without difference of nationality, party, or opinion, to ward off the offensive prepared by international Fascism &apos;i against Soviet Bus si a.&quot;Amidst the distress of which the workers of all oountries in Europe are victims at the present day, through the competition and greed of the capitalist governments, the soviet government, supported by the determination of the workers, declares that it is anxious for peace, and for normal relations with all&quot; states.   It considers the assassination of Vorovsky, and the hostile ultimatum sent by Lord Curzon, as the provocation of fresh disaster, threatening not only the proletariat of Russia, but thf-t of the whole world, and expresses the profound conviction that the instigators of war will find themselves confronted by a world proletariat unanimous in fighting for peace.&quot;Hie ohairman of the Moscow Soviet.Xr. Kamenev.&quot;(b) &quot;To Maodonald, House of Commons, London.&quot;&quot;The Mosoow soviet, expressing the unanimous determination of the workers and all citizens of Mosoow, appeals through you to the English Labour Party, and begs this party to exert every endeavour to prevent the English government from taking irrevocable steps.&quot;The population of our capital, fully occupied with the problem of the economic reconstruction of the country, desires peace and noocmal relations with England, and is fully convinced that the development of active comercial relations would be in the interests of Russia and England alike.   The innumerable meetings which have been held all over the capital ever sinoe the English note was published, are unanimous witnesses of the oertainty that the rupture ; eian be avoided, if the English government will understand that the Russian people&apos; is not to be addressed in the language of ultimata, and will agree to settle all points of difference on principles of reciprocity ana equality,&quot;The Soviet Republic, shaken out of its peaceful work by lord Cur3on&apos;a ultimatum, and by the murder of itb representative Vorovsky, is anxious to obtain peace and peaceful relations at any price, but is, at the same time ready to rise as one man in defence of its independence, its sovereignty, and its government.&quot;The chairman of the Mosoow Soviet,1. Kamenev.&quot;
u 4 -rae COMMUNISTSThe Executive Committee of the Communist Partyoontinues to issue highly coloured statements regarding the angle-Ruesi an situation and has made every effort to intensify its propaganda agajnBt the Governments   there seems littla doubt, however, that the leaders aredisappointed at their failure to &quot;bring about a &quot;united front&quot;.    The following declaration, whioh appeared in&quot;The Workers&apos; Weekly&quot; of Jane 9th may be taken as typical:&quot;The Second British Note to. Russia roveals the warlike intentions of the British Government.   The Russian workers&quot; ocnoessions for peace are made the occasion for new blackmailing demands, which are obviously intended to force a break.&quot;That the Russian workers want peace and Cur a on does not want peace should now be olsar to all.   But the united working olass agitation to end this position here iB still lacking.   Local moves for solidarity are gathering force;   some districts, suoh as Rhondda J3o.l: of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, have pressed for a down-tools policy.   But nationally   there 1b still no response.&quot;The manaee of Curs on&apos;u policzr affect s not only the Russian position, but the whole of Europe.   Cur zoo is working to create a reactionary bloc to hold in the revolution.   It is a policy to orush the hopes of the working class fox a generation.&quot;The first stop was the open and flaunted alliance with fascist Italy, by the sending of the Xing to hobnob with the socialist renegade and mountebank Museolini, while tho blood of the workers was still fresh upon their ruined buildings.&quot;The second step was the Curaon Note to Germany, slamming the door on the German peace offers, and even appearing to declare solidarity with the British Government&apos;e enemy, Prance, in order to provoke the German population into risings of despair to be followed by a second fascist revolution.&quot;The third step was tho hectoring and blackmailing Note to the Russian Workers&apos; Government in order to provoke a breach.&quot;All these steps constitute a combined and definite policy to create a reactionary blood in Europe under British leadership to counterpoise the power of French imperialism and isolate the Russian worters as a preliminary to fresh intervention.   curzon&apos;s policy is preparing the defeat of the working olass in Bxirope before their attempt to recover and advance has begun.&quot;The only way to end Cursors polioy is to endCurzon.   It is no use waiting for war till it cornea. Curzon must be brought down now.&quot;On/
On May 9th th* following telegram was sent to several and probably to all communist groups but aroused very little response:&quot;Instruct every party speaker concentrate weekend on Anglo-Russian crisis conspiracy to break off relations is developing at any moment action may be taken to dismiss Trade Delegation do not slacken agitation dgmand Conference between Russia and Britain and complete recognition workers Republic.&quot;In connection with the attempt to,secure affiliationto the Labour Party, the Political Bureau ha3 informedDistrict Party Committee that:-&quot;The Central Committee has appointed a special Committee tc attend to all the arrangements and make preparations to organise and direct our struggle against the official labourists who will seek to exclude the communists from the Conference^     It is the--intention of this Committee to call a meeting of all Party Members and such sympathisers as we can secure with a view to forming a definite fraotion inside the Conference.&quot;The Executive of the Communist Party is concerned at the number of lapsed members and an effort is to be made to win back the people concerned:   it is said that in Islington alone there are 100 lapsed members.Arising from the recent aggregate meeting, the London District Party Committee has decided to form, organise and co-ordinate nuclei In all trade union branches in London. Hawkins of the Central Industrial Committee has this work in hand and has co-opted Thorns of the Red International of Labour Unions:   groups are of opinion that the work should be decentralised and the organising left to the local men.As a step towards giving effect to the decisions of the recent Berlin Conference of Transport Workers (detailed in Report No. S08) communist members of the National Union of Railsaymen have been instructed to get a resolution passed by their branches to the effect that they:&quot;Instruct/

TSE YOUNG COMMUNIST gjASggDelegates to the Bureau Session, of the Joung-Communla-t International are to he in Moscow by July 8th:   those who cannot obtain visas for HusBia must reach Berlin on June 27th and report to the publishing offices of the young Communist International.&quot;Anti-militarist&quot; propaganda has for some time been one of the main planks in the platform of the Young Communist International and the &quot;Fourth International Bureau Session&quot; drew up a lengthy resolution on the subject which has just reached this country:   the following passages are taken from this document:&quot;1*   gfte. Results of the Work since the Third Congress.&quot;...There can...be stated an increase of the anti-militarist propaganda above all in the oountries of the Entente (France, Great Britain, Italy) and the small Entente (Checho-Slovakia, Rumania) and the border states (Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Esthonla, Finland), furthermore in Germany, in the Near and Far East as well as in Scandinavia, Spain, Argentine and the United States.   This intensified propaganda against militarism found its expression in the press (publication of speoial organs in France, Italy, Spain, Lithuania) &amp;b well as in special campaigns (France, Che oho-Slovakia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Esthonia) and was nationally and internationally connected with a considerably increase of the publication of enti-militarist leaflets, booklets and other material.&quot;With the intensification of the anti-militarist work of the individual leagues there was also brought about international co-operation (co-operation of the French and the German Leagues in the problems of the Ruhr occupation;   participation of these Leagues and of the E.C. in the International conference against the danger of war in Essen and Frankfort, utilisation of the Anglo-Russian conflict).,.&quot;2.   The Nest Tasks.Propaganda.&quot;(a)   Energetic continuation of the propaganda against the danger of war and against the policy of intervention of world imperialism against Soviet Russia,   This work Bhould be carefully adapted to the international conflicts that arise (for instance Anglo-*Russian conflict).&quot;(b)   Establishment of connections with thenations^/
national-revolutionary movements, especially in the Near and Far Bast, &quot;by energetic continuation of the struggle against imperialist armies and, in some countries (China, Mongolia, and Turkey) by propaganda for the formation of revolutionary people&apos;s armies or the support of those which are already in existence, as well as by the struggle against the utilisation of such armies as instruments of militarist oppression in those countries.n(o)   Perfection of the anti-militarist propagandists part in the international and national League and Party Press (columns for soldiers, headings &quot;From the Barracks&quot;) with regard to the quantity as well as to the quality and publication of more material for antl-militarist propaganda (papers for the recruits).&quot;(d)     Collection of material on the internal and external organisation of the armies (their technical equipment and specialisation discipline, subordination, administrative conditions and cultural situation) in order to expose the system of capitalist imperialist military and armament in the national and international press.&quot;(o)   Organisation of the systematic publication of anti-militarist leaflets, popular booklets and propaganda -pamphlets,..Struggle for the.Economic and PoliticalDemands of TEa SoITiers,,&quot;(a)   formulation of the economio and political demands of the soldiers according to the conditions in the various countries (see &quot;Propoganda&quot; (d))&quot;(b)   Utilisation of the communist members of Parliament for- the defence of economio and political demands of the soldiers.Organisational Measures*(a)   Improvement of the internal organisational apparatus for anti-militarist work in all units of the movement (special departments).&quot;(b)   Acceleration of the organisation of nuclei in the armies as the first condition for a systematic revolutionization of the latter.&quot;(o)   Extension of the experiences of illegal work in order to find forms of illegal&apos; work, especially for anti-militarist activity.International Co-operationn(u)   Co-operation of the Leagues in their anti-militarist activity, i.e., of those Leagues which correspond to the imperialist combination in world politics (great \ Entente, small Entente, Border States, Hear end Far East) and discussion of the common tasks on the field of anti-militarist struggle.(1)1/

Ho doubt you will understand the aspects we wish to be emphasised.     We do not quite know whether or not the exchange of those notes really left a deep impression upon the working class youth, altho we do believe that it must have had some effect upon them.    This effeot you should deal with, describing in detail your activities, meetings, demonstrations, etc.     $he article should be lively and comprise not more than 3 or 4 (typewritten) sheets.&quot;We trust that you will comply with our wish immediately and that the article will be in Berlin not later than June 6th.&quot;The Young Communist International publisherte in Berlin appear to be working overtime on material fir this oountry:   lust week Gunther !JtatuoAnformed one of the British officials that:-s&quot;T. has been delayed very much.     But that is all the fault of the P0H,     I hope to be able, however, to send you a first oopy in the course of this week.     Gyptner also has been held up by the P.H.    We have only so far read the pullproof. The P.H., however, is confident that it will be off the press at the beginning of next week...

They know of Its existence alright hut know very little of the details and stages through whioh it has passed,,.&quot;...There is an   International Conference *f the R.I.L.U. taking plaoa about tho end of June, and I have ^een invited to attend as delegate representing the BritishuJJnemployed Movement. This means that I shall he away from England much longer than 1 expeoted.    Further the trouble between England and Russia re trade relationships has capsed the postpsnment of the Extended E.C. until the 10th of June.    Anyway I m occupying my time usefully here.&quot;Hannington/
Hannlngton then asks for recent information concerning the organised unemployed, copies of his pamphlet &quot;Insurgents in London and copies of complete balance sheet.    &quot;This is very important so aon&apos;t fail&quot;.     He aaas &quot;Band it in at King Street to be sent through their channels&quot;,,The Executive Bureau of the, Bed International of Labour Unions has learned with &quot;great pleasure&quot; of the affiliation of the National Unemployed Workers1 Committee Movement and is certain that the movement&quot; will prove a most welcome and valuable reinforcement to the ranks of our International&quot;;   the Bureau has also sent a lengthy list of &quot;recommendations&apos;1 regarding the future activities of the organised unemployed, tho chief of whioh is that thoy should agitate for &quot;trade union control and administration of national and local unemployed relief appropriation&quot; and &quot;complete control by the trade unions of tho Labour Exchanges and all their functions^ &quot;THE &quot;LABOUR DEFENCE COUNCIL&quot;This Council, tho object of which is &quot;to assist trade unionists throughout the world when persecuted by capitalist governments for their working class activities&quot; is showing signs of life:     the members of the council areJohn Brotherton, M.P.Duncan Carmichael (secretary London Trades Council) The Rev.

In a oircular dated june Sth Colyer states that:&quot;In view of the growth of the propaganda of Fascism in this country and the U.S.A. and of a series of prosecutions of trade unionists who have refused to perform 3task wyrk&apos; for lees than union rates of wages, it is necessary to stress the importance of our field of aotivity^&quot;Within the near future we hope to arrange for conferences and demonstrations as a preliminary to undertaking work on a national scale.

IRISH ,,EBVDHJ!PIPHASY AOTIVXTBS III EjBAJP BRITAINThe new Irish Db moo ratio League is progressing slowly, a draft constitution is being prepared and a manifesto to Irish Residents in Great Britain, appealing for their support, is to be issued this week.Da Yalera is being condemned on all sides for prolonging a conflict ho knew to be a hopeless one and is regarded by the majority of the Irish here as a failure both as a soldier and us a statesman.Another point discussed is the position of the ex-deportees who are before tho courts.   It is hoped that too much importance will not be given to.them ttnd their sets.   The better class Irish In this country never took them very seriously and outside small coteries of conspirators they had very little influence.     It is regarded as a matter for congratulation that the newspapers ere devoting so little space to the oaso against them.a:j xiepublioac circles everything is extremely quiet. The ex-deportees are busy preparing their claims against the Government and most of them are having personal interviews with the solicitors employed by the Defence Committee.   Money is also TOry tight, the feeding of the London prisoners alone is costing  10 per week and other expenses are proportionately high.From Scotland it is reported that Madame Marklevics and Joe Brown (the Republican Organiser) are much upset at the continued silence of de Vklers and the entire absence of news from any official source in Ireland.   Brown addressed a Rapublioan meeting in Dumbarton on June let and gave an account of his experiences in Moxutjoy.- Ho complained of bad treatment by the Free State officials.   There were about 180 persona present, but the collection barelypaid/
paid expenses.The Scottish ox-Deportees met in the Renfield street Hall, Glasgow, on June 9th to disousa their grievances hut so far no report has teen received as to the result of their doliherations.   It is stated, however, that they have fixed  500 as the minimum amount to be claimed.labour trouble in Ireland is not decreasing - well-informed men say the danger lies there.   The farm labourers are out for land for themselves and soviet principles are being openly advocated.    A labour split is regarded as being within the bounds cf possibility.
