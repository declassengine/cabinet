13).      1.     I oannot disguise from-my colleagues that there Isground for very Berious uneasiness in regard to the state of unemployment in the oountry.The figures of unemployed on tho Exchange Registers on January 1stwere ... 1,485,900Thoy went down steadily, with some fluctuations, till three weeks ago, when, they stood at       ... 1,163,300whiok is the lowest figure that ,has yet boon reached since the high peak of unemployment in May, 19 SI.I had hopod that this steady reduotion would have oontiaued throughout the summer, but there has been a set-back during the last two or three weeks, and the numbers on the Register have increased again, and now stand at 1,221,300This increase is largely to be accounted for byextended unemployment in Lunoashiro;   the Whitsuntideholidays may also be partly responsible.     I hope thatduring the remainder of June and July the fall in thefigures may be resumed.   I had looked forward to seeingtho total drop well bolow tho million during August and september; to be followed probably by the usual rlao againduring tho winter,   I doubt now if wo shall see it dropbelow the million this autumn.     In any case we must look forward, during tho coming winter, to a figure of at least a million unemployed, and. probably more.The next will be the fourth winter of grave un-employment, and the cumulative, of foot each year of the difficult times through which we are passing, becomosTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT,CABINET. UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE COMING WINTER. MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER Off- LABOUR.
greater and greater;   there are less private savings left, fewer Trade Unions oan continue unemployment benefit, and the deterioration and hopelessness of the worker increase. II. - Last year, provision was made on a large scale for relief works, etc. as follows(a)   Lord St. David&apos;s Committee was authorised to sanction schemes initiated by the Local Authorities up to 12 millions in all, by means of loans, under the heads of either revenue producing or non-rovenufl producing proposals,     The loan charges in respeot of these schemes are spread over periods varying from 5   to 15 years, and tho state enly bears a proportion of them.   The result is that provision by parliament, whioh appears in the Ministry of Health Vote, only represents each year a small proportion of the total ooat of schemes undertaken;   the figure in the ourrent estimates, including provision for earlier loans, amounts to about  1,100,000.In addition, as I announced to the House last Hovsmbor, the late Administration placed  600,000 In the hands of Lord St. David1s Committee, (in addition to the sum of  150,000 then still available), lor the purpose of aotual payments towards small Local mthority schemes, up to 60 por cent of the wages involved.- 2 -
(b) The Ministry of Transport, by means     4^1 of the Road Fund, also were authorised last November to assist further road works on the basis, generally speaking, of   for  ; and in this way no less a sum than  5,500,000 was made available jointly by the Government and Local Authorities] this provision was in February increased by a further  5,600,000.(c) Various Government Departments agreedto acceleration, reconditioning, and repairing work, amounting to about  1,700,000,(d) Rather over  600,000 was placed at the disposal of the Board of Agriculture, the Scottish Board of Agriculture, and the Forestry Commission, for drainage, afforestation and similar work,III, The Cabinet Unemployment Committee has not metsince March 22nd, but a Sub-Committee has been considering the future; and at its last meeting on April 30th. instructed an informal Departmental Committee to consider geographically the black spots of unemployment throughout the country, and what possibility there was of launching big local works in such areas.What I want to draw; my colleagues&apos; attention to is that, apart...from road schemes under the Ministry of Transport, practically, all the provisions above indicated have drawn, or are shortly drawing, to an end, and we have no new financial provisions for the coming winter,IV, In the general programme which I announced last november, there also figure -(l)   The Export Credits Scheme; and
S hi(S) The Trade Facilities Act provisions.With regard to the former, running to  26 millions, the credits sanctioned under the Scheme had not, in November last,   reached more than  22 millions, and although the total credits sanctioned to date are about  26,700,000, if allowance is made for repayments, credits liquidated and credits cancelled, only about  16 millions is actually in use, so that a margin will still be available, though the duration of the scheme may have to be extended.   Broadly, traders do not seem desirous of making use of the machinery to the extent anticipated.&apos; tVith regard to Trade Facilities, the Government in November extended the amount whioh could be guaranteed from  25 millions to  50 millionsj but here again there seems to be something like stagnation, and satisfactory schemes, I understand, are slow In coming forward. Last November the amount guaranteed stood at  22^ millions, and the total has now reached only  25 millions, including the reoent guarantees for ships to  j be built by Harland and Wolff In Belfast.   In addition, negotiations are in progress with Lord Devonport, I understand, for a guarantee of over  4 millions on special terms for London dock extensions.With regard to both programmes, i.e,, Export Credits, and Trade Facilities, there is, therefore, a margin available;   but they do not seem likely to give more than a limited assistance in promotion of trade or employment during the coming Winter.
bj. &amp; jV. Mr. Bonar Law In November, at my suggestion,summoned Directors and Managers of leading industries to meet him, with a view to seeing whether the big enterprises of the country could not press on reconstruction and re-oonditioning work which is much in arrear.   The results were disappointing.   Leading Railway Directors and Managers met us in Downing Street, and promised to do their best;   but in effect the plans they subsequently put forward for capital expenditure amounted to only about  8 millions, which was less than the average annual amount spent in similar work before the War.  Electrification and re-conditioning generally -(greatly in arrear owing to the War) - ought,&apos; in the view of competent experts such as Sir Robert Klndersley, to have been put in hand before now and would run into very large figures indeed. The electrification, for Instance, of the Brighton, appears to be proceeding very slowly, and that of the Great Eastern appears not to have been launched at all.On the other hand, the Railway Depreciation and Reserve Funds, which on December 51st, 1915 were just over  20 millions, on December 51st... 1922. stood at  15.0 millions a large portion
of which ia due to the Government post war compensation payment of  60 millions. Much of these big reserves might well be made available for development at a time like this.VI. ECONOMIC CONFERENCE.I understand that the   Freaidj&amp;nt of the Board of Trad* haa in contemplation schemes on broad and generous lines for empire trade development, and that these will be brought before the Economic Conference in October, I assume that the relation of these schemes to British man power, both in manufacture at home and migration abroad is being closely considered,VII. EMPIRE&apos;SETTLEMENT. Admittedly, this presents difficulties.The Colonial Offioe le the Department which has, quite rightly, the main responsibility in the matter, and the Bverseaa Settlement Committee -non which my Department, as well as the Colonial Office, le represented - has been doing excellent work in settling the lines of big schemes with the Victorian, New South Walea, and West Australian Governments, and to a lesser degree with the Canadian Government,-6*
The settlement of men from this Country In the Dominions cannot primarily be regarded as a cure for British   unemployment, especially ao far as&apos; the less fit are concerned;   and it must not be so treated.   Those of us, like myself, who have travelled much in the Dominions, and have considerable holdings there, know that the Dominions would resent any such policy; but it is difficult to deal with our own unemployment problem, or to get a normal proportion of our industrial population back into work, so long as every possible vacancy is choked with hundreds of fit and capable applicants,My Department ia giving all help possible through the Employment Exchanges, by advertisement, by addresses, by personal interviews, etc.   to stimulate applications for the various migration schemes.   But unfortunately the monthly average of applications through the Exchanges which in March stood as high as 6,300 has in the last few months fallen to between 3,000 and 3,000.Generally it is regrettable to find that move-ment under the various proposals put forward by the Overseas Settlement Committee is proceeding so slowly.   Before the war, some 200,000 British subjects left this country annually to settle in the Dominions without any State assistance
whatever; and I doubt whether, under the various excellent schemes of the Overseas Settlement Committee, in spite of the generous assistance now available under the Empire Settlement Act, we can look forward to more than about 40,000 settlers moving overseas, or roughly only 14 per cent of those who proceeded to the Dominions before the war without any State assistance whatever. VIII. What I propose, therefore,  is as follows;-(l) That forthwith the whole^question of policy involved in relief work during the coming ViInter be considered so that proper financial provision may be forthcoming.     lord St. Davids Committee cannot, unless a further big loan policy is approved hy the Cabinet, sanction any considerable number of further schemes.(2) I would suggest that the Prime Minister, with the co-operation of the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Transport, should again press the Railway Companies and other big industrial enterprises with a view to their putting in hand in the Autumn all possible   developments of new works.(3) With regard to overseas settlement, though this presents more difficulties, I urge that it be pressed on as rapidly as possible.     The Overseas Settlement Committee and its Chairman, the Parliamentary Secretary for Overseas Trade, have done admirable work, as I have already indicated, but I doubt if a Committee, meeting fortnightly, is the best machinery for carrying out a big executive enterprise on the lines contemplated:   and the Parliamentary Secretary has many other and heavy calls on his energies,     I venture to make two suggestions:-
(a)   That It is worth while considering whether the Government should not appoint a Commissioner or Commissioners for Emigration who should devote their whole time and, within the lines laid down by the Overseas Settlement Committee, he given a pretty free hand to carry the policy into execution.(b). I have suggested in one or two public speeches what I have called &quot;associattonal&quot; migration,namely, that big centres of population, that universities and Public Schools, and even Regiments, might be encouraged to take up large tracts of land in theDominions with a view to forming agricultural settlements in the new country.     What is clearly wanted is that morevoluntary effort should be brought into co-operation withthe   State scheme.     The Overseas Settlement Committeehave tentatively encouraged the formation of one or twoCounty Committees somewhat on the above lines, but thereis little, if any, unemployment in the County areas, andthe problem is in the tov/ns.     Towns also have the money.If Manchester or Birmingham, or Eton, or the Brigade ofGuards, were encouraged I believe they could form strongCommittees with considerable funds; in the case of the towns local patriotism, and in the case of Schools orRegiments, common loyalty, would form both a stimulus tooarry the enterprise through, and a link of great value for.the settlers &quot;across the sea.     The Committees in thisCountry could be responsible for the land purchased, forpersonally conducting, and if necessary for the trainingof settlers on landing, and so on; and could give closepersonal attention and stimulus to the settler from thetime he leaves his home Town till che time he is fullyestablished in the Dominions in a way which it is almost impossible for the State to contemplate.     Such a policy would be of great use in dealing with the settlement of whole families,, where special difficulties arise.-9-
I have discussed proposals on -these lines with Prime Ministers from the Dominions and, though I admit there may he difficulties the proposal has been generally well received and oven in Canada I have reason to think it can be made effective.(Intld.) L.B.June 9th, 1923,Ministry.of Labour.ADDENDUM.Since drafting this memorandum, I have read the two memoranda circulated by the Parliamentary Secretary for Overseas Trade, (C.U.540 and C.U.542); but they do not give ground for any material alterations in the above,
