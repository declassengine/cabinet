3 Pi 1is jcoument is the property of His Britannia Jfetjesty^a -Gmern&amp;tehi0*0 A B I IE T,AGRICULTURAL RATES; IN SCOTLAND,Memorandum fey the Home Secretary,The Cabinet referred to me for decision the qtsetion of the amount of Government Grant to he paid to looal authorities in Scotland, corresponding to the grant, estimated at  2,750,000, required to make good to looa.1 authorities in England and Wales the lssa of rates involved in a reduction of the assessability of agricultural land from 50$ to 25$ of full rateable value,The proposals put before me by the representatives of the Scottish Office and the Treasury respectively were-Scottish Offioe - that the grant should be equivalent to ono half of the existing rates on agricultural land in Scotland whether paid by owners or oooupiers.   This is estimated at about  700,000,Treasury     that the grant should be the usual (Gcsohen) proportion (iviths) of the English grant,   Aa the latter is estimated at  2,750.,000, this would give about  380,000,After hearing the arguments of both sides I cannot support the claim of the Soottish Offioe to an amount bearing so high a proportion to the English grant as  700 *000 to  2,750,000, but 1 am impressed by the desirability of making the amount awarded in this case bear a direct relation to the purpose on which it ia to bo spent.   This will of course greatly facilitate tho justification of any figure to the  . House of Commons.Tho proposals of the Scottish Office in this respectwere: -(i) to provide as regards agricultural hereditaments-
(i..o, Including agricultural buildings) 3 that rates should in future be levied equally on occupiers and owners on the basis of half the full amount and that the occupier should be entitled to deduct one half of his rates from his rent0 This amounts very nearly in practice to the owner paying , tho equivalent of 75$ of full owner!s rates instead of 100$ as at present and to the occupier paying 25$ of occupier&apos;s rates instead of 37-g-$ as at pre sent c(S) to apply the balance of the grant to a readjustment of the rating system in regard tp oduoation0I do not think it necessary in this connection to take into account the second proposal which has no special relation to agricultural rating,   The first proposal is estimated to cost approximately  480,000 per annum and I recommend that the grant to bo awarded in Scotland be calculated on this basis.W.
