Copy No.     13 j jjCP. 217 (23).THE CABINET.PROPOSED REDUCTION OF THE ARMY IN INDIA. Qjgj55J2MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has asked for a War Office appreciation of the proposed reductions in the Indian Army, and I think I cannot do better than circulate the paper which I wrote for the Cabinet on 27th April, hut which I did not circulate pending negotiations with the India Office. The only modification I have to make is due to the fact that the Cabinet have agreed that the three cavalry regiments shall be retained ; two are to be brought back to England, whilst the third is a subject of negotiation as regards cost of maintenance between the War Office and the India Office, and the matter is being referred to the Treasury.The Commander-hi-Chief in India has agreed to the reductions, and in order to give the views of the General Staff, I append the following note which I have received from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.D.2nd July, 1923.&quot; Looked at from the military point of view we would rather, have no reductions. If considerations other than military outweigh these, the General Staff are prepared to accept reductions within the limitations herein set forth : (a) Reduction in the Infantry to be limited to 130 men in each battalion.(b) (i) Reduction of 1 R.H.A. Battery.(ii) Reduction in the R.F.A. establishment of men and horses amounting to a saving approximately the same as would be obtained by the abolition of 1 R.F.A. Brigade. (This represents, roughly, a reduction of 1 British officer and 50 British other ranks a R.F.A. Brigade.)(c) The 3 Cavalry regiments to be kept in being, viz., one in India (a sum of about 75,000 to be paid to India towards the cost of this) and two regiments elsewhere at the expense of the Home Government.(Signed)     CAVAN.&quot;The War, Office,mh June, 1923.(B28/180)  102  7/23  W.O.P.  92S

On the grounds that the financial position in India renders it imperative to effect a substantial retrenchment of military expenditure, the Government of India has put forward proposals to reduce the establishment of both the British and Indian sections of the Army in India.   The main reductions, so far as they affect the British troops are (a) A reduction of 130 men in each of 45 infantry battalions (5,850 men) ; saving in a full year, 145-3 lakhs ( 969.000).(b) A reduction of 3 British cavalry regiments (1,791 officers and men) ; saving in afull year, 74 lakhs ( 493,000).(c) A reduction of 1 brigade, Royal Field Artillery and 1 Battery, Royal HorseArtillery ; saving in a full year, 37-4 lakhs ( 249,000).2. As regards (a), the condition originally attached by the Indian Government, that the War Office should undertake to despatch drafts up to 2,500 men immediately on the declaration of war for those battalions which are then in the field army or covering force, has been withdrawn, and it is agreed that all the War Office can undertake is to allow India to anticipate the next drafts, on the outbreak of war, so far as they may then be fit to go to India at once.On this understanding the War Office has accepted the reduction.3. As regards (c), in view of the War Office objection to sacrifice the four field batteries concerned, the Indian Government has produced a modified scheme involving the saving of about 16 officers and 600 men without reduction in the number of field batteries : and the War Office has agreed to this compromise. The horse artillery battery stands or falls with the cavalry (b).4. As regards the cavalry, (b) the War Office has objected to the sacrifice of three more cavalry regiments, for which there is no room on the Home Establishment, and has suggested a general reduction of the Establishment of all cavalry regiments in India in lieu. This suggestion the Indian Government is not prepared to adopt, on the ground&apos; that it would unduly weaken all regiments for war, and would at the same time fail to give the required saving.5. The question for decision is, therefore, whether the virtual abolition of three more cavalry regiments, giving a saving of approximately half a million sterling on the Indian budget in a full year, is to be approved. As far as this year&apos;s budget is concerned the saving would in any event be very small. There might well be a net increased charge for bringing home officers and men and disbanding them with compensation.6. It should be observed that all these reductions will involve, after the first year, an immediate annual loss&apos; to the British Exchequer of about  25 a man ( 210,000 in all, if the full programme were accepted) which would only partly be off-set by savings to be made in the home recruiting and training establishments, as we should have in one way or another to make good the loss of reservists resulting from the reductions. But it is not on financial grounds that my objection is taken.7. The cavalry question requires to be looked at from two points of view (a) its effect on our strength in Regular cavalry, irrespective of its peace distribution ; and (b) its effect on the strength of the Indian garrison as a whole, irrespective of particular arms of the service.8. In 1914 our Regular cavalry consisted of 28 regiments of the line, of which 9 were in India, and 3 Household regiments.   Of the line regiments at home, 12 had an(B23/130)  100  4/23  W.O.P.  813
establishment of 694 officers and men and 659 horses (including 91 &quot;boarded out&quot;). We had also 3 regiments of Special Reserve Cavalry and 55 of Yeomanry. We now have only 20 regiments of the line (of which 8 are iu India), 2, of&apos;Household Cavalry? and 16 of Yeomanry. The line regiments in this country, 8 in number, have an establishment of 576 officers and men and 398 horses. A brigade of 3 regiments could be mobilized promptly, by clubbing together the best horses of the 8 regiments ; but to mobilize the Division of 9 regiments so many fresh horses would be required that it would take many weeks of seasoning and training before the cavalry would be fit for action. It must therefore be clearly understood that the cavalry has already been cut to the bone, and that if 3 more regiments disappear, and India should call for reinforcements of cavalry and she has indicated possible requirements of anything up to 4 extra brigades   there can be no promise that any reinforcements of cavalry would be immediately forthcoming.9. The question also turns on the strength of the British garrison in India as a whole. Should a serious crisis arise, it is undeniable that the presence of these three cavalry regiments in India would be a most Valuable asset ; &quot; and this is not affected by the argument that, could the military authorities in India be given carte blanche as regards reinforcements, -they might, in the first instance, demand arms other than cavalry.10. Coming, therefore, to the general adequacy of the garrison in India, &apos;the Indian Government has included in its despatch reassuring statements, !both as regards possible external complications and the internal situation, and has also invoked the authority of the Commander-in-Chief to support them.The War Office accepts the Government of India&apos;s appreciation of the present external and internal situation, and notes with satisfaction the signs of improvement set forth in the despatch. Ifrcannot, however, share the Government of India&apos;s optimism to the extent of admitting that the amelioration, which may only be temporary, justifies a serious reduction in the British garrison which, once carried out, is likely to be permanent.11. Though the situation is now less immediately threatening, dhere is no evidence that there has been any fundamental improvement. The potential dangers have remained, and are likely to remain, constant. Since the conclusion of the Anglo-Afghan treaty, the Amir&apos;s relations with us have on the whole been satisfactory, but during the last few months there have been many signs of his adopting a less friendly attitude. The British Minister at Kabul, as recently as 3rd April, 1923, has referred to what appears to be a new orientation of Afghan policy directed against us rather than against the Bolsheviks, and the change has been immediately reflected in the tribal situation on our frontier. We cannot ignore tbe influence which the Amir possesses over our frontier tribes, and, from whatever quarter wb-may be confronted with trouble in India, we &apos;must be prepared for Afghan participation against us. Whether they will go to the length of attacking us will depend mainly upon their estimate of our power to defend ourselves.12. The Government of India attributes the present improvement iD the internal situation to the strong measures taken to suppress disorder and to the successful campaign against the Moplahs. We would be the first to recognize this claim and to acknowledge the beneficial effect of the action to which the Indian Government&apos;alludes, but sufficient time has hardly yet elapsed to gauge what permanent effect these measures have achieved, and it is impossible to contemplate, without serious misgiving, a reduction of the forces in India, on a scale which might curtail the Government of India&apos;s ability to take strong anil immediate action, should such&apos;again be necessary.13. Turning to the effect of India&apos;s proposals on the general security of the Empire, I have already pointed out, in a recent Memorandum to the Cabinet (CP. 200/23), the inadequacy of the Army to meet all the liabilities with which it is faced, and the serious consequences to its training and efficiency resulting from the constant threat of:piecemeal reductions.The recent Near Eastern crisis supplies a vivid illustration, of the straits to which We are reduced ; our hands were then tied by the fact that we could not find the troops necessary to enforce our will on Turkey, and at the same time reinforce our garrisons in Iraq, or such places as Egypt. The position will be intensified in the future if, as a result of India&apos;s proposals, we are obliged to increase the heavy liabilities to her for reinforcements which we already bear. Particularly will this be felt in cavalry, if this arm is to be further reduced by the loss of three cavalry regiments.India&apos;s proposal to replace twoof these regiments by armoured car companies is only an internal security arrangement, and an expedient which will not affect the general position with regard to cavalry.
14. I realise to the full the difficulties of the financial situation in India, and it is for this reason that I have accepted, though not without grave misgiving, a reduction of Infantry and Artillery personnel amounting to some 16 officers and 6,500 men, and have suggested (albeit against my better judgment) some reduction in the establishment of Cavalry regiments in India. I hope, however, that my colleagues will agree that this is the limit to which we can go, and that they will not consent to the reduction of the three complete Cavalry regiments proposed by the Government of India.D.The War Office,27 th April. 1923.
