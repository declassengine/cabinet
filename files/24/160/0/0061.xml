The proposals contem-plated ah annual expenditure by His Majesty&apos;s Government up to a maximum of  2,000,000 in respect of schemes of land settlement, assisted passages and other kindred schemes, such expenditure to be conditional upon the full financial co-operation of the Dominions concerned (see Annex I).The Conference of Prime Ministers held in the summer of 1921 approved the proposals of the earlier Conference (see Section X, page 8 of Cmd. 1474). It expressed the hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government would, at the earliest possible moment, take power to perform its part in any schemes of co-operation subsequently agreed on, preferably in the form of an Act, which would make it clear that the new policy was intended to be permanent (see Annex II).The Conference further recommended that the Governments of the Dominions should consider how far their existing legislation might require modification or expansion in order to secure effective co-opera-tion, and should work out for discussion with His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment the proposals which appeared to them most practicable and best suited to their interests and circumstances.In accordance with this Resolution, His Majesty&apos;s late Govern-ment introduced a Bill into Parliament in April 1922.The Bill was passed with virtually no opposition, and is now on the Statute Book. Its short title is &quot;The Empire Settlement Act, 1922,&quot; and a copy of the Act is appended to this Memorandum (see Annex in). The Act authorises His Majesty&apos;s Government to spend up to  3,000,000 per annum on participation in schemes for facilitating settlement in or migration to any part of the Dominions overseas, including schemes of development or land settlement. The executive work in the United Kingdom has been entrusted to a Committee (the Oversea Settlement Committee), on which the Departments concerned are represented together with unofficial members having a special knowledge of migration problems. About[10072] bo .e 9e) O j
11,500 persons have been assisted under the Act to proceed overseas between July 1922 and February 1923.*A statement is appended (Annex IV) containing particulars of the Agreements entered into under the Act with Dominion and State Governments and with private organisations.A table giving statistics bearing on overseas settlement is also appended (Annex V).The primary object of the new policy is to promote the develop-ment of Empire production and consequently of Empire trade. A growing population overseas is a necessary condition and concomitant of the development of Empire production. It is not the only factor, since movement of population cannot by itself be effective unless the settlers are able to make good and to find markets for the produce of their labour. Such aspects of the question are being examined in other memoranda, but it will be generally. recognised that an increase of population in the Dominions is one of the essential requirements for the end in view. The new policy, therefore, aims at remedying the shortage of white population overseas and at diminishing in some degree the present excessive inequality of distribution of the white population of the Empire, while at the same time ensuring that a larger proportion of the normal stream of migrants from the more densely populated countries of the Empire shall be retained under the British flag. It should not be looked upon as a remedy for the immediate abnormal unemployment in this country, but rather as a constructive method of increasing the strength and well-being of the white nations which owe allegiance to the Crown.The aims of the new policy can only be secured by the settlement of population upon the land overseas. There are at present few openings in the Dominions &apos;fOr Industrial workers from this country, and the only male settlers for whom openings are available in con-siderable numbers are those who are able and willing to work upon the land. At the present time, therefore, a policy of Empire-assisted settlement and Empire-directed migration must be primarily a policy of settlement upon the land.In this connection the importance of making suitable provision for the settlement overseas of women and girls must not be over-looked. A certain number of the men to be settled under approved schemes will no doubt be young married men, who will be accom-panied by their wives and families. But the settlement of single women and girls is also essential if the policy is to -have lasting results in the development of the new communities; and the ques-tion of the conditions under whieh such settlement can best take place is a matter which requires careful consideration.Although the figures-quoted show that the new policy has already produced concrete results, there are indications that the scheme of State-aided Empire settlement has not as yet been so successful as it might be-made in promoting the development of primary resources and placing new settlers upon the land overseas.In so far asState-aided settlement has fallen short of success, the lack of success appears to be due to the fact that the co-operation between the Governments of the Empire contemplated by the Empire Settlement Committee, who reported in 1917, by the preliminary Conference and the Prime Ministers&apos; Conference held in 1921, and recently extended and made permanent by the Empire&apos; Settlement Act, has been less complete and the measures adopted less compre-hensive than they should have been. In this country there is still misunderstanding and ignorance in regard to the aims and nature of the new policy, and the arrangements made between His Majesty&apos;s Government ahd the Dominion representatives for selecting and recruiting new settlers are still far from perfect.One of the chief difficulties is the insufficiency of arrangements overseas for the reception, distribution, training, settlement upon the land and initial supervision of British settlers. Unless these arrangements are made adequate and prove adequate in practice, the adoption of a strong policy -in this- country will result in disillusion -meht and disappointment and will ultimately check instead of increasingmigratiOn.* note.-His Majesty1 s Government also initiated shortly after the armistice a scheme of &quot;Free &quot;Passages for -ex-service men and -women wishing; to settle overseas. The number of approved applicants and their dependents -who have sailed under the scheme is approximately 83,000. This scheme has now heen closed down.
The Report of the Oversea Settlement Committee for 1922 (see Cmd. 1804) refers at length to each class of settler to be dealt with under the new policy, i.e., children and juveniles (the migration of which classes appears to give the greatest promise of success), women and adult males, both single and married, and with families. The Report indicates the arrangements which are thought necessary for each class of settler.This Report also explains and emphasises the importance of migration in the development of trade between the Dominions, and the United Kingdom, and in the creation of new wealth for the Empire.His Majesty&apos;s Government feel strongly that the need of popu-lation overseas, and also wider and more far-reaching considerations, such as the defence of the Empire, and the future expansion of the British race, make it desirable that the Governments of the Dominions and of the United Kingdom should co-operate in a con-tinuous policy of State-aided Empire settlement.It is fully recognised that in present circumstances it is difficult for certain oversea Governments to co-operate upon a large scale, that it may be harder to promote a large volume of successful migra-tion in times of trade depression, like the present, than in times if trade activity, and that the fall in the price of agricultural produce is a temporary hindrance to successful settlement.It is also recognised that migration is viewed with disfavour by certain classes of the community both here and overseas. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, it is believed that this disfavour is partly traceable to the lack of organisation in the past, and it should, therefore, be diminished by the improvements of organisation which we recommend. So far as the oversea countries are concerned, it is believed that apprehensions will be allayed when it is clearly under-stood that the policy is framed primarily with a view to land settle-ment and provides an adequate organisation for selecting and train-ing the intending settlers.In view of the importance of the establishment of a continuous policy of State-aided migration, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared, on their side (subject, of course, to the necessary co-opera-tion on the part of Oversea authorities), to consider any proposals which may be put forward for co-operation on their part in schemes of Empire settlement and migration within the limit of  3,000,000 available annually for the next fourteen years under the Empire Settlement Act.They are also prepared to do everything possible in concert with Dominion representatives to perfect the arrangements in the United Kingdom for selecting and recruiting intending settlers.They desire, however, to repeat and emphasise the fact that the next essential step in promoting Empire settlement on right lines lies with the Dominions. They venture accordingly to urge on the Governments which participated in the January-February 1921 Conference which may not yet have given full effect to Resolution No. X of the Conference by making &apos;&apos; special arrangements for the reception, distribution and initial supervision of British settlers,&quot; the importance of making satisfactory provision for this purpose-with the least possible delay.April 1923.Annex I.(Appendix V to Cmd. 1474.) Conference on State-Aided Empire Settlement.January-February 1921: Record of Proceedings.A Conference on State-aided Empire Settlement was held at the Colonial Office on the 28th and 31st January and on the 1st, 2nd and 4th February, 1921, between representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government and representatives of the Governments of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand.His Majesty&apos;s Government were represented at the opening meeting by Viscount Milner, President of the Oversea Settlement, Committee, and in his absence the chair was taken at subsequent[10072] &quot;\   &apos;.     :&apos; - b 2
meetings by Lieutenant-GolonelL. S. Amery, M.P., Chairman of the Oversea Settlement Committee.   Representatives of the Treasury, Ministry of Labour and Oversea Settlement Committee also attended. The following represented the three Dominions concerned : Canada The Hon. Sir George Perley, K.C.M.G. Lieutenant-Colonel J. Obed Smith.Australia Senator the Hon. E. D. Millen.Mr. Percy Hunter. New Zealand The Hon. Sir James Allen, K.C.B.Mr. H. C. Cameron.Mr. V. Mills.In opening the proceedings, &quot;Viscount Milner stated that the Conference had been summoned in order to advise upon an enduring policy of oversea settlement which should tend to bring about the best distribution of the man-power of the Empire and so to develop and strengthen the whole Empire. He pointed out that oversea settlement should not be regarded as a means of dealing directly with abnormal unemployment in the United Kingdom, at any given moment, but as a means of remedying fluctuations of trade by developing our best markets and of permanently minimising the risk of unemployment here and throughout the Empire. He emphasised the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that no stone should be left unturned to secure for the Dominions the population which they require and to ensure that the outflow of population from the United Kingdom should have opportunities for settlement under the flag in countries British in spirit and British in their institutions.The Agenda submitted to the Conference for discussion was as follows : Part 1. To consider the general question of Empire develop-ment, including schemes for land settlement on a com-prehensive scale. . Part II. To discuss the following particular proposals : (a.) Advance of cost of ocean passages and railway fares to approved settlers, (b.) Advance of cost of outfit where required, (c.) Free passages for State-aided children. (d.) Preference to British settlers over foreign immigrants,e.g., in respect of landing money, &amp;c. (e.) Arrangements for recruiting settlers in this country andfor their  reception,  settlement,   employment   and welfare overseas. (/.) Appointment of representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment overseas to co-operate with the Oversea Govern-ments in the reception, settlement and welfare ofnewly-arrived British subjects.It was clear from the outset that in all the Dominions repre-sented the openings available for workers of other classes depended upon the increase in the number of primary producers. It was, consequently, agreed that the problem covered by Part I of the Agenda, i.e., the problem of establishing settlers from this country as primary, producers upon the land overseas, must be the basis of any policy of State-aided Empire Settlement, and that the facilities for inter-Imperial migration generally, proposed in Part II of the Agenda, would only be of limited value unless granted as part of a policy based on land settlement.In this connection Senator Millen pointed out that there are considerable areas in Australia suitable for settlement, but at present entirely undeveloped, which could be developed by comprehensive settlement schemes at considerably less cost than would be involved in the purchase, of land in districts already opened up. Such schemes would have the further advantage that the work of opening up an area by railways and roads, the construction of other public works, and the clearing of the land, &amp;C;, would find employment for many of the intending settlers, as well as an opportunity for getting acclima-used to Australian conditions.    Opportunities for settlement on a
very large scale would also be afforded by the irrigation works in progress on the Eiver Murray. As an indication of what Australia might be willing to do, if she could secure the co-operation of His M.&apos;ajesty&apos;s Government, he put forward for consideration a scheme for establishing 20,000 British settlers on certain selected areas, to be financed by a Commonwealth loan of  20,000,000 to be raised in five annual instalments. On the analogy of the assistance given by the Commonwealth to the Australian States in connection with the Australian soldier settlement schemes, he suggested that the assist-ance of His Majesty&apos;s Government might take the form of a payment for five years of half the interest of each instalment of the loan.Sir G. Perley and Sir J. Allen intimated on behalf of their respective Governments that&quot; they would welcome a policy of co-operation which would enable them to receive and establish on the land a larger number of British settlers than they could otherwise deal with. They had not received definite instructions from their Governments, and were not therefore in a position to submit definite proposals. They would, however, communicate with their Govern-ments, who would no doubt formulate proposals before the meeting of the Prime Ministers in June. It was pointed out that conditions varied in every Dominion, and that what was desirable was agree-ment not on a uniform type of scheme, but upon the general principle of co-operation between the Governments concerned.On behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, it was pointed out that the most convenient form of financial co-operation and the one most easily adaptable to various kinds of schemes, would be in the shape of loans to individual settlers made through and collected by the Dominion Government or settlement agency concerned, thus diminishing the amount required to be found by the latter in respect of each settler. This was preferable to a direct contribution towards a Dominion development scheme such as was implied in Senator Millen&apos;s suggestion of payment of part interest of a Commonwealth loan, and would achieve the same end.In the discussion on Part II there was general agreement as to the satisfactory working of the system of co-operation between the Oversea Settlement Committee and the Dominion and State repre-eentatives in connection with the grant by His Majesty&apos;s Government of free passages to British ex-service men, and as to the desirability of any future joint scheme of assisted passages being conducted on similar lines. The need for assisted passages was more particularly emphasised by the representatives of Australia and New Zealand, Sir G. Perley explaining that Canada had never, in the past, contri-&apos; buted towards passages, and might possibly prefer some other form of joint co-operation in helping new settlers to sharing in a scheme for granting or advancing passages.The special attention of the Conference was drawn to the success-ful results attending the Australian and New Zealand system of nominations for assisted passages of relatives or friends in the United Kingdom by settlers already established in those Dominions, as well as to the very satisfactory working of the Canadian system of settling and supervising State-aided and other suitable children from the United Kingdom.It was generally felt that in present circumstances, at any rate, there was not1 sufficient justification for the appointment of per-manent representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Dominions in connection with the settlement of newly-arrived British subjects, and that the need for close personal touch with the actual work of settlement overseas could be sufficiently secured by periodic visits of representatives of the Oversea Settlement Committee.As the outcome of the discussions of the various matters covered by both parts of the Agenda, the following proposals were submitted to the Conference by Lieutenant-Colonel Amery as a basis for discus-sion at the forthcoming meeting of Prime Ministers : 1. His Majesty&apos;s Government to co-operate with the Oversea Governments in a comprehensive policy of Empire land settlement and Empire-directed migration, extending over a period of years, and to this end to contribute up to a maximum of  2,000,000 a year in any year in respect of schemes of land settlement, assisted passages and such other kindred schemes as may commend themselves to the . Governments concerned.
2. The assistance to land settlement to take the form of advances to settlers up to a maximum of  300 a settler, the advances to be made through the Oversea Governments concerned or through specially approved private organisations, and repayments collected by them. These advances to reckon pari passu with the advances made by the Oversea Government or private organisation in respect of conditions, security, terms of repayment, &amp;c. The repayments to be devoted to further advances to new settlers. In so far as expendi-ture not recoverable in the form of advances may be involved in training or allowances during training, His Majesty&apos;s Government to share this with the Oversea Government or private organisation concerned, the amount so spent being deducted from the amount available for loan purposes.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government to assign normally about half its total contribution, viz., about  1,000,000 to land settlement. In view, however, of its commitments in respect of the free-passage scheme for ex-service men and women and other kindred expenditure arising out of the special conditions of the post-war situation, the amount available for land settlement for the financial years 1921-22 and 1922-23 will probably not exceed  750,000. In allocating this money as between different schemes it will be guided primarily by the merits of the schemes both from the point of view of their economy, i.e:, the number of settlers they can deal with for a given British contribution, and still more from that of the arrangements for training, future prospects of the settler, social amenity (group settlements), &amp;c, and other things being equal, by the desire to afford all the Dominions an equal opportunity for developing their resources and strengthening their man-power.4. His Majesty&apos;s Government to assign the balance of its contri-bution to assisted passages, including, if necessary, outfit and landing money allowances. As regards passages, the following was suggested as a basis for discussion : One-third of the passage money to be given as a free grant and one third as an advance, the latter t-o be increased up to two-thirds in special cases where the Governments concerned are agreed as to the desirability of the assistance being given and as to the prospects of repayment. The cost of the assistance so given to be divided equally between His Majesty&apos;s Government and that of the Dominion concerned, the latter undertaking to collect the advances on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The repay-ment to be devoted to additional assistance to passages. Contribu-tions to schemes of child emigration or settlement to be wholly in the form of grants and not of loans.5. If any Dominion would prefer, in lieu of a joint contribution to assist passages, some alternative scheme for the assistance of settlers generally or for land settlement, His Majesty&apos;s Government to consider the allocation to such scheme of the amount it would otherwise have contributed to assisted passages in respect of settlers proceeding to that Dominion.6. In view of the commitments of His Majesty&apos;s Government to its ex-service men up to the end of 1922, and of the arrangements already made by other Governments for their own schemes of assisted passages, it is not contemplated that the general scheme for assisted passages referred to above should come into operation before the middle of 1922 or the beginning of 1923.,7. All settlers receiving assistance under any of the above schemes to be subject to selection and approval by His Majesty&apos;s Government and by the Government of the Dominion concerned. Preference to be given, as far as may be possible, to ex-service men.8. As a part of this general scheme of co-operation, the Dominion Governments to make special arrangements for the reception, dis-tribution, and initial supervision of British settlers, who should, as far as conditions permit, be given preferential treatment over foreign immigrants. His Majesty&apos;s Government on its side to undertake to make the necessary corresponding arrangements for furnishing information and advice and for carrying out any policy with regard to Oversea settlement and emigration that may be agreed upon.These proposals were approved of by the Conference, the repre-sentatives of the Self-governing Dominions expressing the view that they contained a generous offer on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and represented a sound and practicable scheme. It was clearly understood that the offer was conditional upon the full
financial co-operation of the Dominions concerned as regards both land settlement and assistance in respect of passages. The Conference passed the following resolutions : &quot; 1. That this Conference recommends the proposals appended to the Minutes of its meeting of the 4th February (i.e., the proposals given above) to the most careful considera-tion of the Governments of the Empire for discussion and final decision at the forthcoming meeting of Prime Ministers.&quot;2. That in cases where money for expenses overseas is advanced to settlers from Government funds, the money should be paid to the Oversea representative in this country on the settlers&apos; account and transmitted overseas for payment to the settlers on arrival.&quot;3. That the bonus system, i.e., the system of recruiting settlers by means of per caput bonus payments to third parties, should be abolished as from the 1st July, 1921.&quot;4. That it is desirable, in order to emphasise the dis-itinction between the movement of British subjects within tho Empire and emigration to or immigration from foreign countries, that such expressions as &apos; oversea settlement,&apos; &apos; Empire settle-ment &apos; or &apos; British settlement,&apos; &apos; oversea settlers&apos; or &apos; British settlers &apos; should be used in connection with the movement of British subjects within the Empire in preference to &apos; emigra-tion&apos; or &quot;immigration,&apos; &apos; emigrants&apos; or &apos; immigrants,&apos; these latter expressions being confined to, movement to and from countries outside the Empire.&quot;Annex II.Conference of Prime Ministers, 1921: Section X of Report (Cmd. 1474/1921).X. Empire Settlement and Migration.The question of Empire Settlement and Migration was considered by a special Committee under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and the following Resolution was finally adopted by the Conference : &quot;The Conference having satisfied itself that the proposals embodied in the Beport* of the Conference on State-aided Empire Settlement are sound in principle, and that the several Dominions are prepared, subject to Parliamentary sanction and to the necessary -sary financial arrangements being made, to co-operate effectively with the United Kingdom in the development of schemes based on these proposals, but adapted to the particular circumstances and conditions of each Dominion, approves the aforesaid Beport.&apos;&apos; The South African representatives wish to make it clear that the limited field for white labour in South Africa will preclude co-operation by the Union Government on the lines contemplated by the other Dominions.&quot; (2.) The Conference expresses the hope that the Govern-ment of the United Kingdom will, at the earliest possible moment, secure the necessary powers to enable it to carry out its part in any schemes of co-operation which may subsequently be agreed on, preferably in the form of an Act which will make clear that the policy of co-operation now adopted is intended to be permanent.&quot; (3.) The Conference recommends to the Governments of the several Dominions that they should consider how far their existing legislation on the subject of land settlement, soldier settlement and immigration may require any modification or expansion in order to secure effective co-operation; and should work out, for discussion with the Government of the United Kingdom, such proposals as may appear to them most practicable and best suited to their interests and circumstances.&quot;
Empire Settlement Act, 1922. . Chapter 18.An Act to make Better Provision for Furthering British Settlement in His Majesty&apos;s Oversea Dominions.   [May 31, 1922.]Be it enacted by the King&apos;s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows : 1. (1.) It shall be lawful for the Secretary of State, in associa-tion with the Government of any part of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions, or with public authorities or public or private organisations either in the United Kingdom or in any part of such Dominions, to formulate and co-operate in carrying out agreed schemes for affording joint assistance to suitable persons in the United Kingdom who intend to settle in any part of His Majesty&apos;s Oversea Dominions.(2.) An agreed scheme under this Act may be either (a) a development or a land settlement scheme; or (&amp;) a scheme for facilitating settlement in or migration to any part of His Majesty&apos;s Oversea Dominions by assistance with passages, initial allowances, training, or otherwise ;and shall make provision with respect to the contributions to be made, either by way of grant or by way of loan or otherwise, by the parties to the agreed scheme towards the expenses of the scheme.(3.) The Secretary of State shall have all such powers as may be necessary for canying out his obligations under any scheme made in pursuance of this Act:Provided that (a) the Secretary of State shall not agree to any scheme withoutthe consent of the Treasury, who shall be satisfied that the contributions of the Government, authority or organisa-tion with whom the scheme is agreed towards the expenses of the scheme bear a proper relation to the-contribution of the Secretary of State; and(b) the contribution of the Secretary of State shall not in anycase exceed half the expenses of the scheme; and(c) the liability of the Secretary of State to make contributions under the scheme shall not extend beyond a period of fifteen years after the passing of this Act.(4.) Any expenses of the Secretary of State under this Act shall be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament:Provided that the aggregate amount expended by the Secretary of State under any scheme or schemes under this Act shall not exceed  1,500,000 in the financial year current at the date of the passing of this Act, or  3,000,000 in any subsequent financial year, exclusive of the amount of any sums received by way of interest on or repay-ment of advances previously made. .2. His Majesty may by Order in Council direct that this Act shall apply to any territory which is under His Majesty&apos;s protection, or in respect of which a mandate is being exercised by the Government of any part of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions as if that territory were a part of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions, and, on the making of any such order, this Act shall, subject to the provisions of the Order, have effect accordingly.3. This Act may be cited as &apos;&apos; The Empire Settlement Act, 1922.&apos;&apos;
Agreements Entered Into under &quot;The Empire Settlement Act, 1922.&quot;(i.) Schemes Concluded.(a.) Passage Schemes.1. A Passage Agreement, dated the. 19th July, 1922, has been concluded with the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia for the assisted migration of suitable persons (men, women and children) desiring to settle in the Commonwealth. Under this scheme the assistance normally takes the form of a free grant of one-third and a loan up to one-third of the cost of the passage. Additional assistance by way of loan is given in special cases towards the cost of passages, and provision is made in necessitous cases for assistance towards other expenses. The cost of the assistance granted is shared equally by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Commonwealth Government. The probable cost to His Majesty&apos;s Government during 1923-4 is approximately  420,000.2. A Passage Agreement, dated the 28th August, 1922, has been concluded with the Government of New Zealand for the assisted migration of suitable persons (men, women and children), the Dominion Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government contributing upon an agreed scale by way of grant and loan towards the cost of passages. The probable cost to His Majesty&apos;s Government during 1923-4 is approximately  125,000.(b.) Land Settlement Schemes.1. Western Australia. An Agreement, dated the 14th February, 1923, has been concluded with the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Government of Western Australia for assisting suitable persons to settle on the land in Western Australia. The Government of the State undertakes to settle about 75,000 new settlers (men, women and children) from the United Kingdom within a period of three years, and to establish about 6,000 of these settlers on farms of their own at an estimated cost, excluding passages, of  6,000,000. The Commonwealth Government has undertaken to raise on behalf of the State Government the necessary loans, and His Majesty&apos;s Governments contribution towards the scheme is the pay-ment of a sum equivalent to one-third of the interest on the loans for a period of five years. The probable cost to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment during 1928-4 will be approximately  7,000.2. Victoria. An Agreement, dated the 12th April, 1923, has been concluded with the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia (who have concluded an Agreement on the same lines with the Government of the State of Victoria) for assisting 2,000 persons to settle on farms of their own in Victoria over a period of fifteen months. The Commonwealth Government is to raise on behalf of the State a loan of  3,000,000. The contribution of His Majesty&apos;s Government will take the form of a recoverable advance of  300 in respect of each settler who is provided with a farm. This scheme is the first instalment of a scheme for settling 10,000 persons on farms in this State. The advance to be made by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment during 1923-4 will be approximately  240,000.(c.) Other Schemes.1. Passage Agreements have been concluded with the Dominion of Canada, providing for assistance to the following classes of settlers : (a.) Children.-Giants of 80 dollars per head in respect of the transport expenses of 5,000 children (boys and girls) not less than 8 years of age at the date of sailing, or who have not reached the age of 15 years on the 1st April, 1923, and are sent to Canada under the auspices of a recognised Child Migration&apos;Society. The total cost to His Majesty&apos;s Government during 1923-4 will be approximately  50,000.(b.) Single Women. A loan of the minimum third-class fare to approved domestic household workers from port of embarkation in this country to their rail destination in [10072] o
Canada. The .total cost to His Majesty&apos;s Government during 1923-4 will be approximately  50,000. (c.) Families.&apos; A loan of 75 per cent, of the cost of transportation in the case of families nominated by a person of British birth domiciled in Canada and proceeding to agricultural employment. The total cost to His Majesty&apos;s Government during 1923-4 will be approximately  50,000.2. Ontario. An Agreement, dated the 1st February, 1922, has been concluded with the Government of Ontario, for assisting 2,000 single men and 2,000 single women to migrate to Ontario during a period of twelve months. The men will be placed on farms and the women in household service.3. Society for the Oversea Settlement of British Women Loan Fund. An Agreement has been concluded, dated the 19th March, 1923, supplementing the Loan Fund of the Society. Assistance will be granted to suitable women settlers who are unable to bear the whole of the expenses of their journey overseas, and who are not eligible for assistance under Agreements with Oversea Governments. The estimated cost to His Majesty&apos;s Government during 1923-4 is approximately  2,500.(ii.) Schemes under Negotiation.(a.) Land Settlement Schemes.1. New South Wales. A scheme is now in negotiation for assist-ing 6,000 persons to settle on farms in New South Wales. The Commonwealth Government propose to raise on behalf of the State a loan of  6,000,000, and it is proposed that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should pay one-third of the interest for a period of five years. The scheme also provides for a contribution of  300 per settler to be advanced by local banks with a guarantee from His Majesty&apos;s Government against loss.(b.) Other Schemes.1. Salvation Army.-Agreements dealing with : ;(a.) Single women; and (b.) Blind-alley boys.2. Church Army. An Agreement is nearing completion for training boys for farm work and girls for domestic service.3. Dr. Barnardo&apos;s Homes. An Agreement has been drafted for assisting, as an experiment, parties of 75 boys and 50 girls to proceed to New South Wales, and is awaiting an indication of the amount of assistance which will be afforded by the Commonwealth Government.4. Fellowship of the Maple Leaf. An Agreement has been drafted, and is now with the Society, for supplementing their Loan Fund, out of which they assist teachers to proceed to the Western Provinces of Canada.5. Australian Farms, Limited. A scheme is being discussed whereby the Company will raise a loan for a land development scheme on condition (a) that the interest on the loan is guaranteed to them for a termof ten years, and(b) that they will raise at least an equivalent loan without aguarantee of interest.This scheme is now being considered by the Directors of the Company in Australia.6. Child Emigration Society. A scheme has been agreed in principle for assisting the Fairbridge Farm School in Western Australia with the provision of new buildings and the maintenance and training of additional children.7. The Craigielinn Bpys&apos; Training Farm. An Agreement is now ready for assisting in testing lOOJboys per annum in Scotland with a view to their migration to Canada and Australia. This Agreement will probably be signed at an early date.8. British Dominions Emigration Society. An Agreement has been drafted for assisting seventy-five families to proceed to Canada during the next three months.are nearing completion for

In despatches dated the 26th April, 1916, copies of a draft Bill to facilitate the reciprocal enforcement of judgments, orders and awards in the United Kingdom and other parts of the Empire were sent to the Dominion and Australian State Governments.(ii.) Correspondence ensued, and in despatch Dominions No. 648 of the 13th August, 1919, copies of Cmd. 251 containing the report of a Committee appointed by the Lord Chancellor were forwarded; this Committee recommended various amendments in the original draft Bill.(iii.) In accordance with the recommendations of. that Committee legislation was passed by Parliament dealing with reciprocal enforce-ment of judgments in the United Kingdom and in other parts of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions. This is contained in Part II of the Administration of Justice Act, 1920, under which (Section 12) a judgment includes an. award in proceedings on an arbitration if the award has, in pursuance of the law in force in the place where it was made, become enforceable in the same manner as a judgment given by a Court in that place.(iv.) In despatches of the 24th January, 1921, copies of the Administration of Justice Aot, 1920 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. V, cap. 81), were sent to the Dominion and Australian State Governments, special attention being invited to Part II. It was pointed out that the provisions of the Judgments Extension Bill previously submitted had been considerably modified in Part II of the new Act, generally with a view to imposing safeguards securing that judgments obtained in other parts of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions should only be registered for execution in the United Kingdom in cases where such registration is just and convenient.(v.) Provisional Rules of the Supreme Court (Administration of Justice Act, Part II), 1 922, dated the 29th May, 1922, were sent to Dominion and Australian State Governments in despatch Dominions No. 216 of the 28th June, 1922.(vi.) Up to date Orders in Council have been made extending Part II. of the Act to the following: Dominions and India: New Zealand and Newfoundland. Australian States: West Australia and South Australia.

Summary of Recommendations of Lord Uolwyn&apos;s Committee on Liability of Dumiuion and Foreign Governments to United Kingdom Taxation ...        ...        ...    memorandum.1. So far as is known, the general question of policy with regard to the treatment of State-owned or controlled commercial enterprises in respect of their immunity both from taxation and from the other obligations to which private commercial enterprises are liable has never been dealt with as a whole.The increasing extent, however, to which certain Governments have recently tended to engage in trade is giving this problem an increasing practical importance, and, should nationalisation of industries extend in future, some understanding on the subject will become imperatively necessary. Private enterprise is naturally restive under State-organised competition and the commercial com-inunity will certainly not stand the indefinite continuance of a state of things under which they are exposed to what they regard as the unfair competition of enterprises which are free from the ordinary trade liabilities to which they themselves are subject.2. The only international action that has so far been taken in the matter is that expressed in Article 281 of the Treaty of Versailles and the corresponding Articles of the other Peace Treaties : Article 281. &quot;If the German Government engages in inter-national trade it shall not in respect thereof have or be deemed to have any rights, privileges or immunities of sovereignty.&quot;These provisions are general as covering all forms of immunity and all forms of enterprise, but they are limited to trade between the &apos;&apos; ex-enemy &quot; countries and other countries.3. A proposal for international action with respect to the case of State-controlled shipping was formulated by the International Com-mittee on Maritime Law at its recent meeting in London in the shape of a series of recommendations to form the basis of a draft Convention (see Annex (A)). The above-mentioned Committee is entirely unofficial, but the recommendations were brought before the Inter-national Maritime Conference whieh met at Brussels in October 1922 to consider certain Conventions for the unification of Maritime Law. As will be seen from the Report of the British delegates (copies of which have been sent to the Dominions and to the Colonies concerned), after an informal exchange of views, the subject of immunity of State-owned ships was adjourned until the next meeting of the Conference.The scheme, as will be seen, is limited to shipping enterprises, but otherwise it is intended to apply reciprocally to all countries that may accept it and to cover all forms of immunity, whether from taxation or from carriers&apos; liabilities, &amp;c.[9896]
The views of His Majesty&apos;s Government are generally favourable to the scheme, but their war experience leads them to consider it essential to safeguard the position of ships and State-owned cargo in ships operated by or on behalf of the Government of a country at war, for the purpose of safeguarding essential supplies. Subject to the insertion of a suitable reservation to this effect in the proposed Con-vention, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to become party to a Convention on the lines suggested, of course, on a reciprocal basis. Such acceptance would give great satisfaction to the commercial interests connected with shipping.4. The proposed Convention would, however, leave untouched the position of State-controlled enterprises other than shipping, and it is worth while to consider how far other enterprises (e.g\, railways, banks, &amp;c.) should not be dealt with on similar lines.5. Lastly, reference should be made to the recent report of Lord Colwyn&apos;s&apos; Committee, which has already been circulated to the Dominions and which dealt with the liability of Dominion and foreign Governments to United Kingdom taxation.The reference to this Committee was limited to one form of immunity, viz., from taxation, but otherwise the enquiry was very broad and general, embracing all forms of Government property and undertakings and not merely commercial enterprises controlled by the State.The Section of the Report summarising its conclusions is annexed (Annex B).6. There are two alternative methods by which the subject may be dealt with, and it will be for the Imperial Economic Conference to consider their relative advantages and drawbacks.The alternatives are : (a.) To deal wdth the proposals of the Colwyn Report as to taxa-tion, and of the International Maritime Committee on State-owned shipping (subject to any amendments or reservation considered necessary), on the ground that though this method of treatment of the subject is frag-mentary, it probably represents the line of least resistance, and a solution of these two urgent problems would pave the way for further progress.(b.) To frame a general proposition on the lines of Article 281 of the Treaty of Versailles, but extended to inter-Imperial as well as to international commerce and to cover not only trade but all forms of enterprise (commercial, industrial, shipping, financial, &amp;c).On the whole His Majesty&apos;s Government prefer alternative (a) as offering the most practical means of achieving a substantial and immediate advance.May 1923.Annex (A).Immunity of State-Owned Ships.Resolutions adopted by the London Conference of the Comite Maritime International (October 1922) and recommended as a basis for cm International Convention.1.

We would again emphasise the desirability of acting as early as possible.1. Property in the United Kingdom owned by a Dominion Govern-ment, otherwise than in a trading capacity.We recommend that Dominion Governments should be exempted from United Kingdom Income Tax on all income arising to thern from property, real or personal, which they.own in the United Kingdom, except so far as the property may be owned or held in a trading capacity.In the case of real property, we recommend a corresponding relief from payment of Land Tax, so far as the property is occupied for official purposes.These exemptions should be conferred by statutory enactment.2. Properly in the United Kingdom owned hy a Dominion government -ment in a trading capacity, and profits derived by a Dominion Government or its agents from trade in the United Kingdom.We recommend that all Dominion Governments should be invited to agree to the following proposition : Any Government within the Empire, so far as it engages in trade, shall be treated as liable to the taxation of any other country within the Empire, in which it may either own property in connection with trade or make trade profits; the liability of the United Kingdom Government or any Dominion Government so far as engaged in trade shall be co-extensive with the liability of a private trading corporation in similar circumstances.We recommend that, on such an agreement having been reached, the Crown should be made legally liable, in accordance with the agreement, by provisions in the statute law of the several countries.3. Property in the United Kingdom or the Dominions owned by a foreign Government in a trading capacity, and profits derived by a foreign Government or its agents from trade in the United Kingdom or the Dominions.We recommend that, after the principle of mutual taxation has been agreed within the British Empire, negotiations should be opened with the Governments of foreign countries, with a view to reciprocal agreement between those countries and the Empire to the following effect: If or when the Government of a foreign country carries on trade in the United Kingdom or in a Dominion, and if or when the Government of a country within the British Empire carries on trade in a foreign country, the trading Govern-ment shall not, in its character as such, be treated as entitled to any sovereign immunity from taxation either directly or through the claim of superiority to the jurisdiction of municipal Courts; nor shall a Government so trading be treated as entitled to any sovereign immunity from taxation in respect of property in the other country concerned which it may own or hold in a trading capacity or in connection with trade.It would be a proviso to the whole agreement that it should be-without prejudice to the national interests of a sovereign State in any emergency of war.such liabilities should be enforceable only by the like tribunals, but only of the State by which the ship is owned or operated, and should be enforceable by action in personam against such State, and, in addition, by any other form of procedure permitted by the law of such State.

India...3 4 42 copy of Report of the British Empire Statistical. Conference, 1920.*1. The Beport of the British Empire Statistical Conference of 1920 is appended, together with the observations received on the subject from the Dominions and India.2. A careful consideration of the whole question leads to the con-clusion that there is no practicable mean between the establishment of a Bureau substantially on the lines suggested by the British Empire Statistical Conference of 1920, though perhaps at a some-what reduced cost, and the establishment of a small Bureau with the much more limited functions of preparing compilations of Imperial Statistics of the kind now included in the Board of Trade Abstracts.3. Apart from the question of the cost, it is doubtful whether the former alternative would meet with universal acceptance by the various Governments concerned.4. There would seem to be no serious objection in principle to the transfer of the work of the Colonial Section of the Statistical Department of the Board of Trade to a Bureau under Inter-Imperial management or control: but there are. however, considerable objections of a practical order to the establishment of a separately-managed Statistical Bureau with com-paratively limited functions and correspondingly small staff. All experience shows that statistical work is more effectively conducted and supervised if organised on a large scale, i.e., if the&quot; various-branches of work instead of being isolated and separately managed form parts of a single whole. In such circumstances the staff acquires-a greater variety of experience and consequently becomes more expert. It can also be better grouped and graded, and it is easier to maintain an even flow of work by dovetailing branches which are liable to special pressure at different periods of the year. It is also-possible to provide for highly skilled control at the top without an expense disproportionate to the volume of the work. Hence on purely statistical grounds there is much to be said against a small inde-pendently-managed Imperial Bureau, and it will probably not be. thought desirable to set up such a, Bureau merely for the limited purposes indicated above, unless the Conference should decide, for other purposes, to establish some form of Imperial Board which, among its various activities, would take statistics under its wing.5. In the meantime and pending the establishment of a definitive Imperial organisation, the following alternative suggestion (which is substantially that put before the Dominions Royal Commission by the Board of Trade) is put forward for consideration as offering atMemorandum.* Not reproduced (Cmd. 648/1920).[9897]
least a provisional solution which would attain most of the objects of a separately-managed Imperial Bureau without incurring the dis-advantages referred to above.This suggestion is to leave the executive work of compilation and publication of abstracts of &quot;Imperial&quot; statistics to.be carried on as at present by the- Board of Trade, but to establish an Imperial Advisory Committee to supervise the work from an Imperial point of view, i.e., especially from the point of view of contents, sources, arrangement, presentation, &amp;c, of statistics.April 1928.Observations from the Dominions and India.I. Canada.Approved Minute forwarded by the Governor-General of Canada. (P.C.-.1732.)Certified Copy of a Report of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by -his Excellency the Governor-General on the 25th August, 1920.The Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated the 13th July, 1920, from the Minister of Trade and Commerce, submitting that he has had before him the report and resolutions adopted by the Conference of Government Officers engaged in dealing with statistics in the British Empire, held at tho Board of Trade, London, the 20th January-26th February, 1920.The report recommends the establishment in London at the earliest possible moment of a Bureau of Statistics for the British Empire, adequately equipped and staffed, for the purpose of obtain-ing, collating and publishing statistics which bear upon the conditions and resources of the Empire, the common interests of its members and their relations with the rest of the world. It is proposed that the Bureau shall be under the control of a Council, to be incorporated by Royal Charter, consisting of members nominated in due proportions by the several Governments assenting, and to be under the immediate -charge of a Director, assisted by an Advisory Committee, appointed by the Council, the Director to be appointed after consultation with the several Governments assenting. The remaining resolutions of the Conference deal with the principles and methods desirable in various sections of the statistical field for the purpose of promoting uniformity and co-ordination, and are such as may be adopted. in essential features by the Government of Canada.The Committee, on the recommendation of the Minister of Trade and Commerce, advise that the proposals made by the Conference he approved in principle and that the Hon. Sir George E. Perley, K.C.M.G., High Commissioner for Canada, be appointed to represent the Government of Canada in the discussion of details in connection with the preparation of the proposed Royal Charter.The Committee, on the same recommendation, further advise that your Excellency may be pleased to forward a copy hereof to the Right Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies, for the informa-lion of His Majesty&apos;s Government.All of which is respectfully submitted for approval.(Signed)     G.

Commonwealth of Australia.Despatch from the Governor-General of Australia.Commonwealth of Australia, Governor-General&apos;s Office, Melbourne, My Lord, - August 9, 1920.Referring to your despatch dated the 26th April, 1920, Dominions, No. 178, covering copies of a Parliamentary Paper con-iaining the Report of the British Empire Statistical Conference, 1
have the honour, at the instance of niy Prime Minister, to inform your Lordship that the Commonwealth Government believes that it would be desirable at the appropriate time that a conspectus of the statistics and organisation of the Empire should be readily available for the use of the Governments and publicists of all parts of the Empire, and that, as recommended by the Conference, a Bureau of Statistics for the British Empire should be created.. As to the appropriate time for creating such a Bureau, the Commonwealth Government takes this opportunity of pointing out that several of the self-governing Dominions, viz., Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and Australia, have, at considerable expense, already. organised Bureaux to deal systematically with the matters of Census and Statistics for their particular parts of the Empire; but the United Kingdom has not as yet organised a similar body to assemble what may be called the statistical products of various departmental activities, and my Ministers suggest that the creation of such a Bureau in the United Kingdom appears to be a desirable, if not indeed a necessary preliminary to the establishment of an Empire Bureau. When the Bureau for the United Kingdom has been estab-lished, the aggregation of the material collected for the purposes of the Empire as a whole could be better and more expeditiously effected. Unless such an organisation were first created, a large part of the work of the proposed Empire Bureau of Statistics would necessarily consist of formulating the statistical conspectus of the United Kingdom itself, a labour with which the Empire Bureau ought not to be charged.With the purely technical and other aspects of the proposals the Commonwealth Government is in substantial agreement.I have, &amp;c.

The Dominion Government entirely approve of the develop-ment and co-ordination of the statistics of the Empire on the lines suggested in the other Resolutions of the Conference. New Zealand statistics already cover much of the ground recommended, and when-ever practicable alterations and extensions will be made in accordance with the recommendations of the Conference.I have, &amp;c.(Signed)     JELLICOE, Governor-General.The Right Hon. the Viscount Milner, P.C., G.C.B., Secretary of State for the Colonies.

You added that.our opinion on the proposal to constitute a Central Bureau of Statistics for the British Empire was required as early as possible, and if necessary should be furnished in advance.It will be some time before we shall be able to formulate our views on all the numerous recommendations of the Conference. We have, however, considered the Resolution regarding the establishment of a Statistical Bureau for the British Empire. We approve of this proposal and we accept generally the views of the Conference regard-ing the functions and constitution of the Bureau. We note that it is proposed that the funds necessary for the maintenance of the Bureau should be obtained by joint contributions from the various Govern-ments of the Empire which adhere to the Bureau and that the fixation, of these contributions is to be left for settlement by a further meeting of representatives of those Governments in London. We have no objection to this proposal and presume that you will select our representative at this meeting.We have, &amp;c.CHELMSEORD. C. C. MONRO. G. S. BARNES. W. H. VINCENT. MUHAMMAD SHAPI. T. H.

The Commercial Intelligence Services overseas maintained by His Majesty&apos;s Government are the Trade Commissioner Service within the Empire and the Consular and Commercial Diplomatic Services in foreign countries.The Trade Commissioner Service.Occasion was taken at the Imperial War Conference of 1917 to call the attention of the representatives of the Dominions and India to the measures which were being adopted at that time to extend and strengthen the Trade Commissioner Service. As a result of a reso-lution passed by that Conference, the Governments of the Dominions and of India were invited to utilise the services of His Majesty&apos;s Trade Commissioners should they desire to do so. The present position is as follows : Canada. The Canadian Government stated that for Canadian purposes use could be made advantageously of the services of His Majesty&apos;s Trade Commissioners in India and Ceylon, and also in the Straits Settlements when a Trade Commissioner for that territory should be appointed. In the other countries included in the Trade Commissioner scheme the Dominion of Canada already had its own Trade Commissioners, and, beyond establishing mutual goodwill and co-operation between them and His Majesty&apos;s Trade Commissioners in these centres, they considered that it would not be necessary to make demands upon the time of His Majesty&apos;s Trade Commissioners. In the countries named above in which Canada had no trade repre-sentative, and until such time as such representatives should be established, the Dominion Government accepted the offer of His Majesty&apos;s Government.In September 1921, the Canadian Government appointed Trade. Commissioners for India and the Straits Settlements, and have con-sequently now ceased to utilise the services of His Majesty&apos;s Trado Commissioners.Australia. The Government of the Commonwealth of Australia are also taking steps to establish a Trade Commissioner Service, and consequently have not found it necessary definitely to avail themselves of the offer of the services of His Majesty&apos;s Trade Commissioners.New Zealand. The Government of New Zealand have availed themselves of the services of the Trade Commissioners in Canada and in South Africa.South Africa. The Government of the Union of South Africa expressed their appreciation of the offer, and requested that Trade Commissioners should be asked to render any assistance possible when addressed direct by them. [9898]
Newfoundland. The Newfoundland Government utilise the services of the Trade Commissioner at Montreal.India. The Government of India availed themselves of the services of the Trade Commissioners in all parts of the Empire, and still do so.The duties of Trade Commissioners in the matter of co-operation with the Governments who utilise their services have been laid down as follows : -(a.)_ To reply to commercial enquiries which may be addressed to them by traders or by the Governments represented, and to suggest suitable local agents for producers or manu-f acturers in the part of the British Empire represented;(&amp;.) To notify the Government represented of changes in the customs tariff or other regulations affecting its trade;(c.) To report any openings for trade or contracts open to tender which might interest producers or manufacturers in the, part of the British Empire represented;(d.) To circulate or distribute in the area in which they are stationed official literature relating to the trade, agriculture and. manufacture of the part of the British Empire repre-sented; and(e.) Generally to watch over the trade interests of the part of the . British Empire represented in the area in which they aro stationed.The Consular Service.   .As the result of an arrangement made in 1912 with the Govern-ment of Canada and subsequently extended to the other Dominions, Dominion firms are at liberty to apply direct to any of His Majesty&apos;s Consuls for information as to the possibilities of sale of Dominion products, the method under which business is conducted and the best means of getting into touch with markets. Under the terms of the agreement, Dominion Trade Commissioners are also at liberty to apply to His Majesty&apos;s Consuls for advice and assistance.The agreement did not, however, provide for Governors-General, Dominion Government Departments or High Commissioners com-communicating direct with Consular Officers. On one or two occasions when this point has been raised by a Dominion Government or a High Commissioner, attention has been called to the inconvenience which would be caused by direct applications from Dominion Govern-ments or their official representatives in the United Kingdom addressed to. Consular Officers for information on commercial and similar questions. It has been pointed out that (a.) The desired information can in many eases be supplied by the Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade (which Branch is now merged in the Department of Over-seas Trade) or by the Diplomatic Missions abroad, thus avoiding unnecessary demands on the time of the Consular Officers; and(b.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should, as far as possible, be in a position to know the amount of work which is being placed on individual Consular Officers.It has, however, been made clear that no objectipn is seen to direct communication between a Dominion Government and Consular Officers putsjde Europe taking place on exceptional occasions when time was of importance and where a,, distinct saving of time would result from direct communication, though it has been requested that all communications with Consular Officers in Europe should as hitherto be carrjed on &quot;through the Secretary of Stat/e for the Colonies. Jn cases where it is&apos;merely a question of obtaining cprn-mercial information there is, of course, no objection to a High Commissioner bringing the matter directly to the attention of the Department of Overseas Trade.Commercial Diplomatic Service.The -question of fbe Governments pf the B-Qttiimpns and India making use of the services of commercial diplomatic offipers by means of direct cqrrespondenpe wag pot raised, as, in tlie case of fihe trade
Commissioner Service, during the Conference of 1917, very largely because it was considered premature to do so whilst the Service wasundergoing a process of complete reorganisation, and whilst it wasnot yet possible to gauge with any accuracy the amount of workwhich would be thrown upon the newly-appointed officers.     there organisation of the Service has, however, now been completed, and 375in 1921-2 arrangements were made with the Government of canada and later suggested to the other Dominion Governments under whichDominion firms and Trade Commissioners would be able to apply to commercial Diplomatic Officers for similar assistance to that whichthey receive from Consular Officers.It is still considered desirable that enquiries which the Govern-ments of the Dominions and India or their official representatives in the United Kingdom wish to address to commercial diplomatic officers stationed in Europe should, in the first instance, be trans-mitted through the regular channels to the Department of Overseas Trade. Little or no delay will result from the maintenance of this procedure, and in many cases the supply of information required will, in fact, be expedited owing to the information already being within the possession of the Department.If, however, the Governments of the Dominions and of India think it would be of advantage to them, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be glad to make arrangements under which the services of com-mercial diplomatic officers outside Europe can be utilised by them in the same way and to the same extent as the services of His Majesty&apos;s Trade Commissioners are at their disposal. Similar arrangements could also be made in respect of Senior Consular Officers in extra-European countries where there are no commercial diplomatic officers if this is desired.April, 1923.

I. General Description oj Existing Gable Routes. Two main sets of routes start out from Great Britain : (a) The trans-Atlantic routes, and(b) The Eastern system of cables which between them serve practically the whole of the British Empire.(a.) Trans-Atlantic Routes.There are fourteen cables between the British Isles and North America, some landing (this side) in the Irish Free State and the rest in Cornwall; and all landing on the other side in British territory  Newfound-either in Newfoundland or in Canada-though many of them are land, extended by shorter sections to the United States. Canada.Two of these trans-Atlantic cables, the &quot;Imperial Cables,&quot; are owned by the British Government. The other twelve cables are all worked, and most of them also owned, by American companies.Both the Imperial Cables are worked direct between London and Halifax. They both land near Penzance (Cornwall); but they are laid by different routes, one having a relay station at Harbour Grace (Newfoundland), and the other at Payal, in the Azores. (Further information concerning the Imperial Cables is furnished in Section II.)Besides serving Newfoundland and Canada and forming a link in the westward route to Australia and New Zealand, the trans-Atlantic cables connect at Halifax with the cables of the Halifax and Bermuda and Direct West India Companies (two affiliated British British West companies), which  provide an all-British route via Bermuda and Indies&apos; Turks Island to Jamaica, where it joins the West India and Panama Company&apos;s system. They also connect with the latter system through the medium of the United States land lines (owned and worked by American companies) and cables from Florida to Jamaica via Cuba.These systems also serve. British Guiana by wireless from BritishTrinidad. Guiana.Australia and New Zealand are served by two routes : (1) by the Australia. Pacific Cable, which is owned and worked by the Pacific Cable Board (representing the British, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand Governments) and runs from Bamfield (Vancouver) to New New Zealand. Zealand and Australia via Fanning and Fiji, being connected witli the Imperial Atlantic Cables by means of a landline between Halifax and Bamfield leased from the Canadian Pacific Railway; and (2) by the cables of the Eastern and Associated Companies.[9899] b
Gibraltar. Malta. Egypt. Aden.East Africa. -South Africa. India. Ceylon. Singapore.South Africa. West Africa. Ascension.&apos;: St. Helena.India.(b.) Eastern System.This important system is owned by the Eastern Telegraph Com-pany and its Associated Companies. There are seven cables starting from Porthcurno (Cornwall), of which one lands in Spain, two in Portugal, two at Gibraltar, one at Madeira,, and one at the Azores. The Iberian routes are extended through the Mediterranean via Malta to Egypt, and thence down the Bed Sea to Aden. There they separate, one route running to East and South Africa (see below) and the other to India, Ceylon and Singapore, and thence via the Dutch East Indies to Australia and New Zealand.The cable to Madeira forms the first link in a second chain to South Africa, which runs via St. Vincent, Ascension and St. Helena, with branches to the West African Colonies. Prom South Africa it is extended across the Indian Ocean, so as to form a second route to Australia.The cable to the Azores serves South America (via St. Vincent and Ascension).It should be mentioned also that the Indo-European Telegraph Company have a system of landliiies which before the war provided an alternative route to India, via Germany, Poland, Russia&apos; and Persia; being connected with Great Britain by means of leased wires in the Anglo-German Government Cables. This system has been repaired since the war, but is not yet worked for through traffic.II. Imperial Cable Service.The Imperial Cable No. I was formed by the diversion, dining the war of one of the Emden-Azores-New York cables, the eastern section being diverted to Penzance and the western section to Halifax. The cable thus formed was brought into use in July 1917.Under the Treaty of Versailles, Germany renounced all rights to these and other cables in favour of the Principal Allied and Asso-ciated Powers. The allocation of the cables has been discussed by the Powers, but an agreement has not yet been reached. The British claim, however, to retain the Imperial Cable has not been seriously challenged.The Imperial Cable No. II was formerly the property of ttiij Direct United States Cable Company, who had leased it to tho Western Union Company. The latter company terminated the lease ; and the British Government purchased the cable in November 1920. In November 1922 it was diverted from Ireland to Penzance,- in order that it might be worked side by side with the Imperial Cable No. I.The Imperial Cables cater specially for traffic with the Dominions. The service, as above mentioned, is worked in close connection with the Pacific Cable Board&apos;s service to Australia and New Zealand. The Board work the Halifax station on a repayment basis, and look after the interests of the Imperial Gables generally in Canada. Australasian traffic is sent over a special line leased from the Canadian Pacific Railway, which is worked by the Board direct between Halifax and Bamfield, the terminus of the Pacific cable. West Indian traffic is sent from Halifax by the British cable route via Bermuda.The Imperial Cable Service re-established the deferred rate to Canada a considerable time before the Cable Companies did so, charging the pre-war deferred rate of i^d. to Eastern Canada, whereas the Companies, on reintroducing their deferred service, for some time charged 6d. a word, although they eventually came into line. The Imperial Service was also the first to introduce a 3d. Night Letter Telegram rate to Eastern Canada:. Eor some years past the Week-end Service to Australia and New Zealand at quarter rates has been provided by the Imperial-Pacific route only. The Imperial Service alone has restored the deferred press rate to Canada at 2 d. a word, and the Imperial-Pacific route alone has restored the deferred press rate to Australia and New Zealand at       a word.The Dominion Governments frequently in the past pressed pro-posals for the establishment of a Government Atlantic cable route, and now that such a route is available-and is the only trans-Atlantic cable route under purely British control an appeal can be made with confidence to those Governments to give it their full support by arranging (as most of them do) for the transmission of nil Govem-ment traffic over the route, and in any other way that may be open to them.
The position of the Imperial Cable Service as regards exchange of traffic with the Canadian National Telegraphs is not, however, altogether satisfactory. When the Imperial Cable No. I was first brought into operation, the Canadian Pacific Railway was the only organisation in a position to supply a connecting wire to Montreal, and it demanded, as a condition of doing so, an exclusive arrange-ment for dealing with traffic passing over the cable for Canada. This arrangement cannot be terminated until next year, and only then on payment of a substantial penalty. With some difficulty, arrange-ments were recently made with the Canadian National Telegraphs for. the acceptance of traffic in Canada for transmission by the Imperial Cables; but when these arrangements came to the know-ledge of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company it claimed that they were contrary to the spirit of the agreement with them; and although this contention is not admitted, the arrangements with the National Telegraphs have not yet been brought into operation.III. Pacific Cable: Proposed Duplication.The Pacific Cable Board have for some time been considering pro-posals for the duplication of their route. The need for duplication is most urgent on the longest (and therefore slowest) link between Vancouver and Fanning Island; but it has been decided to postpone the laying of a new cable between these points and between Fanning and Fiji, partly on account of the very high cost and partly because of the prospects that a system of &apos;&apos; loading &apos;&apos; long-distance submarine cables may soon be perfected which would considerably increase the carrying capacity. Experimental tests are, however, being carried out in connection with the adoption of wireless transmission as a second means of communication between Vancouver Island and either Fiji or Panning Island.As regards the south-western links of the cable (south of Fiji), the four partner Governments have agreed to lay cables between Auckland and Suva and between Sydney and Southport; and con-tracts for the manufacture and laying of these cables have been placed. The date specified for the completion of the work is August 1923.IV. West Indies Service.An Agreement was made in 1914 between the Imperial, Canadian and West Indian Governments and the West India and Panama Telegraph Company providing for a large reduction in cable rates to-the British West Indies in return for subsidies of  8,000 a year each from the Imperial&apos; and Canadian Governments, and of  10,300 a year from the various Colonies, making a total of  26,300.a year, The period was for ten years, expiring on the 30th September, 1924.The Company&apos;s financial position has been steadily getting worse, and for some time past there has been serious risk that they would go into liquidation. They were given permission a few months ago-to increase the rates between Great Britain and the British West Indies (excluding Jamaica) from 2s. 6d. to 3s. a word, the corre-sponding rates from the first zone of Canada and the United States being increased from Is. &amp;d. to 2s. a word.Recently an Inter-Departmental Committee has been considering the arrangements to be made on the expiration of the Panama Com-pany&apos;s Agreement in September 1924, and has recommended a scheme under which a new cable would be laid between Turks Island and Barbados, with branches from Barbados to Trinidad and George-town (British Guiana), while the smaller British islands in the Lee-ward and Windward groups would be served by wireless from Barbados. With the approval of the Cabinet, tenders have been obtained for the provision and laying of these cables and for the con-instruction of wireless stations, and these tenders are now under the consideration of the Governments concerned.V. Eastern System.For some time after the war there was serious delay on the Eastern and Associated Companies&apos; cables, owing mainly to the growth of traffic and to the closing of the Indo-European Company&apos;s [9899] b 2
route to India via Germany and Russia and the Great Northern Company&apos;s route to the Ear East via Siberia.The Eastern Companies laid a new line of cables to Singapore in 1920: and they have recently completed a second line of cables to the Straits Settlements via Alexandria, Aden, Seychelles and Colombo. The opening of these cables has effected a substantial improvement in the service, which is now within measurable distance of its pre-war efficiency. Some relief has also been afforded to the Eastern system by the reopening of the Great Northern Company&apos;s route across Siberia, and further relief will be afforded when the Indo-European Company&apos;s service between this country and India is reopened.In connection with the laying of the above-mentioned second line of new cables (costing approximately  3,000,000) the Associated Companies asked that their landing rights should be substantially extended. Careful consideration was given to this request by the Imperial Communications Committee and by the South African and Indian Governments, and eventually it was agreed to extend the licences until the end of 1944. The conditions were substantially the same as those already in force (including the control of rates, half-rates for Government telegrams, &amp;c), with the addition of a clause providing that, if the State should at any time desire to expropriate the Companies&apos; system (or a part thereof which would leave the Companies with a self-contained system) it should be free to do so, and that, failing agreement in regard to terms, the Com-panies should not oppose in principle a Bill promoted in Parliament by the Postmaster-General for the compulsory purchase of the cables in question.VI.- Rates.A statement is attached showing the principal cable rates in force in 1908 and at the present time.The Eastern Company reduced their rate to South Africa from &quot;2s. 6d. to 2s. a word in December 1919, and made corresponding reductions in the rates to British West Africa and British East Africa. Further, in connection with the recent extension of their landing rights, they have agreed to examine the possibility, when the capa--city of their cable system has been increased, of making a reduction in the rate to the Straits Settlements (2s. Wd.) and in certain local rates between British Possessions in regard to which anomalies exist. They also agreed to restore the Week-end Services which were in operation on their system before the war as soon as traffic conditions permit. As shown in SectionV, the delay on the Eastern system has been considerably reduced, and it seems probable that the Com-panies will be in a position to restore the Week-end Services before long.The Australian Post Office have the right, under an agreement with the Eastern Extension &quot;Company, to require that Company to reduce the rate between the United Kingdom and Australia from 3s, to 2s. 6d. a word, the Company bearing a reduction of 5d., and the Australian Administration (which charges a terminal of 5d. a word even on traffic which is collected or delivered by the Company or the Pacific Cable Board) reducing their terminal from 5d. to 4d. If this reduction had been made, a similar reduction would have been made -on the Imperial-Pacific route. The Australian Administration -decided, however, that in view of the pressure on the cables, the -question of reducing the rate should be deferred. It is presumed that this question will be revived in the near future, especially if a wireless service is established.It should be added that all recent licences to British Companies have provided for the control of rates. This takes the form of a -clause providing that the Company may not increase existing rates without the Postmaster-General&apos;s consent, and that if the Post-master-General calls upon the Company to reduce their rates and no agreement can be reached the question is to be referred to the-Railway and Canal Commission, which shall have power to fix tho lates. x

Imperial Wireless Scheme.In 1919 the Imperial Government authorised the completion of the stations of the original Imperial chain in England and Egypt, the mast of which had already been erected. These stations were intended to form the first link in any larger Imperial scheme.. The Oxford Station was completed in August 1921 and the Cairo Station in April 1922, and a regular service between the two stations was opened at the beginning of May for the transmission of traffic between Great Britain on the one hand and Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Abys-sinia, Erythrea and Italian Somaliland on the other. Steps are being taken,for the inclusion of Mesopotamia, Aden and other places in these arrangements.The Oxford Station is also used for (1) the broadcasting of British official communiques;(2) the transmission of long-distance radio-telegrams and newsmessages to ships at sea; (3) the transmission of press messages (a) to Halifax (Nova Scotia) for Canadian and Americannewspapers;(b) to India.In connection with the Halifax service, remarkably successful results have been achieved. The number of words transmitted nightly averages about 5,000, but as many as 12,000 words a night have been dealt with in an emergency.In November 1919, the Government appointed a Committee, known as the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee, under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry Norman, to prepare a complete scheme of Imperial wireless communications in the light of modern wireless science and Imperial needs. In June 1920 this Committee submitted a report, which was subsequently approved by the Imperial Govern-ment subject to the concurrence of the Dominions, recommending that a chain of Imperial stations should, be erected in England, Egypt, East Africa, Singapore and Hong Kong by and at the cost of the Imperial Government, and in India, Australia and South Africa by and at the cost of the Governments concerned. In pursuance of the Committee&apos;s recommendations, the Government at the end of 1920 appointed a Commission of Experts, which in December 1921 sub-mitted detailed plans and specifications for the construction of the stations.The scheme of the Imperial Wireless Committee did not, however, receive support from the Dominion Governments. A strong feeling grew up in Australia, South Africa and India in favour of direct communication without the use of intermediate stations; it was also decided by the Commonwealth and Union Governments to entrust
the erection of their stations to private enterprise, representing Marconi interests. &apos;In these circumstances, the situation was reconsidered in July 1922, and the Imperial Government decided to proceed with the erection in England of a station of the ultimate power contemplated by the Expert Commission (instead of the smaller power, which they had proposed should be used in the first instance) with a view to the provision of direct commercial communication with India, South Africa and Australia. They also offered to erect a station in India, to be worked by the Indian Government, capable of direct comniuni-cation with England, South Africa and Australia. As a corollary of this decision, the proposed second station in Egypt and the station in East Africa were definitely deferred, and the question of the provision of stations at Singapore and Hong Kong was held over for further consideration.This was the position when. Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s Government came into power. The new Cabinet reviewed the question afresh and ultimately decided that in view of developments in the science of wireless telegraphy and other circumstances which had arisen since the late Government decided upon the policy of a State-operated wireless chain, it was not necessary any longer to exclude private enterprise from participation in wireless telegraphy within the Empire, and that licences should therefore be issued for the erection of wireless stations in this country for communication with the Dominions, Colonies and foreign countries subject to the conditions necessary to secure British control and suitable arrangements for the working of the traffic.At the same time the Cabinet decided that it was necessary in the interests of national security that there should be a wireless station in this country capable of communicating with the Dominions and owned and operated by the State. A station of this kind will there-fore be erected as early as possible, and will be available for eom-mercial traffic as well as for service messages.These decisions are now being acted upon. The terms of tho licence to be granted to the Marconi Company are being considered by the Departments concerned.VIII. Suggestions.It is suggested that the following proposals should be put before the Imperial Economic Conference : (o.) That representatives of the Dominions and India should be associated in the work of the Imperial Communications Committee when questions of interest to them are under consideration.(b.) That in view of the fact that the Dominions interested in the Pacific cable have for a long time pressed for the provision of a State-owned connecting link across the Atlantic, all possible support should be given by the Governments of the Empire to the State-owned Atlantic cable route which has now been provided.(c.) That in any concessions given in the British Empire to private enterprise in respect of cable or wireless services (including broadcasting stations) preference should be accorded to British Companies.April 1923.

Empire Patents.A copy of- the Reportof the British Empire Patent&apos;Conference, 1922, is circulated herewith. It shows what action was- taken to carry out; the Resolution&apos; of the Imperial Conference of 1921, endorsing the following proposal-of a special Committee :  .&quot;The Committee recommends that a conference of repre-sentatives of die Patent Offices of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions shall be held in London at an early date to consider the practicability of instituting a system of granting patents which should be valid throughout the British Empire.&quot;The definitive recommendations of the Report were as follows : (a.) The existing rights of the United Kingdom, the self-governing Dominions, and India to grant patents in accordance with their laws and within their own territories to be maintained in full.(b.) The establishment of a Central Patent Office for: the reception and examination of applications for; and- the grant of, patents which shall extend to the United Kingdom, or to-any of the self-governing Dominions, or to India, upon registration in the particular territory in which protection is.desired. The application for registration to be open to-opposition before registration is actually effected.(c.) The Central Patent Office, in examining applications sub-mitted to it, to make a search coextensive with the field at present- covered by the searches now made in the-United Kingdom-, the self-governing Dominions and India collectively.(d.) The scheme suggested above to be equally applicable to all. the Colonies and Protectorates, subject to the qualification that the application for registration shall not be open, to--opposition unless the existing law makes provision for the hearing of opposition to the grant of patents, but. in any case the local Courts to be empowered to declare that an exclusive privilege has not been secured in i,he territories within their jurisdiction..(*.) The fees for registration to be, of; such- amount as would: result; in a considerable reduction in the total cost of obtaining patents throughout the. Empire- at the present: time.. &apos; While the Conference accepted the above scheme as that which would have the greatest chance of success and acceptance throughout the Empire, the Delegates felt that in view, of the difficulty of equipping a Central Office with all&apos;the necessary material for the extended examination and of the time and expense which.would necessarily be involved, it would be desirable to consider the possibility of some provisional scheme, which might be put into force[9908]* Not reproduced..
until such time as the &quot; preferred&quot; scheme became capable of realisation.This proposal was adopted and the Provisional Scheme as drafted and accepted is as follows : (a.)

They are constantly improving, and they are closely watched in order that no opportunity may be lost of accelerating or otherwise giving better facilities.- It is perhaps hardly necessary to point out that inter-Imperial communications are based on commercial requirements, and that if cargo and passenger tu&amp;ffie demand speedier ships the mails will automatically benefit; but that in the absence of those commercial requirements it is not the policy of the Post Office to create fast services for the sake of the mails alone.As regards the less prosperous Colonies which lie off the main routes of sea communications, it has been found that more frequent and less expensive mail services can be provided by making use of all opportunities afforded by the calls of passing steamers. In these circumstances, it is the policy of the Post Office not to make contracts involving large annual payments, but to send mails at poundage rates by all ships available. For instance, the service to the West Indies under the R.M.S.P. contract, which was terminated by the company in 1915, limited the service to once a fortnight; under present arrangements mails are sent four or five times a month.Generally speaking, all steamship services, with one or two notable exceptions, such as the Union Castle service to South Africa and the New Zealand Shipping Company&apos;s service through the Panama Canal, are performed at slower speeds than before the war.March 1923.[9900]b

It is doubtful, however, whether commercial require-ments would justify a more frequent service than that at present in force.The route through Italy has been abandoned since the war ; the gain in time would not be very considerable, and the cost of carrying the mails across Italy would be very high.British lines to New York and direct.Regular service is impossible at present as the Trans-Pacific sailings are nob at regular intervals as before the war.

Civil Air Transport Subsidies ConimitLee&apos;s Report on Government Financial Assistance to Civil Air Transport Companies/&quot;Empire Commerce and the Air. Memorandum by the Air Ministry.When the question of speeding up Imperial Communications was discussed at the Imperial Conference in 1921, the con-elusion was reached that surface communication offered no hope of considerable improvement, and the use of air routes for this purpose was therefore considered. At that time, however, there were not sufficient data upon which definite action could be taken. The object of the present memorandum is to summarise the subsequent develop-ments in regard to air commerce and to suggest the desirability of the co-ordination of Imperial air policy in the future.The main directions in which the air offers service of commercial utility to tho Empire are Communications and Survey.1. Communications. Since the Imperial Conference of 1921, a Civil Aviation Advisory Board consisting of technical experts and representatives of the leading commercial Associations in Great Britain have considered in detail the operation of alternative services by heavier than-air machines from Great Britain to India. The report of the Committee is attached.Since this report was issued further experience has been gained on the subsidised air routes between England and the continent, which has resulted in increased efficiency in the maintenance of regular services only surpassed by the 100 per cent, efficiency obtained in Australia. It has also shown the practicability of a more intensive use of material than in the past with resultant economies in running costs, and it is reasonable to suppose that this principle could be still further extended by a unified control and operation of British air lines. Recommendations embodying this principle were made by the Hambling Committee which sat early in this year. The report of this Committee is also attached. Although consideration of Imperial air routes was outside the terms of reference to this Committee, many of the considerations upon which their recommendations are based are equally applicable to the question of Imperial air routes.Proposals for utilisation of airships on a commercial basis on the Imperial routes have been formulated and are now under cpnsidera-tion, but it should here be recorded that though the adoption of an airship policy for the main Imperial routes would affect aeroplane services, the effect would not be adverse. Heavier-than-air and lighter-than-air services should be complementary. The commercial utility of airships is confined to long distance flight, and in any* Not reproduced.  (Cmd. 1739/1922 and Cmd. 1811/1923.)f)D&apos;0 0 4
airship route the stopping places would be at a great distance from one another. It can be anticipated that an airship service would create a demand lor speedy transport radiating from these stopping places to cities off the line of route and to intermediate commercial centres on the line.of route.The saving of time which would result from the establishment of air routes will be apparent from the comparative table attached (Annex (A)), which shows the times taken in transit on certain Empire routes when travelling (i.) By existing means of communication, (ii.) By airship services employing a type of airship known tobe a practical possibility, (hi.)- By an existing type of aeroplane employed in daylight flying only.*Practical proof of the potentialities of obtaining such time-saving results is afforded by the service which is carried out by the RA.JF. from Cairo to Bagdad. By this service the time occupied in the carriage of mails between Cairo and Bagdad is reduced from nineteen days to two. Extension of the route to Karachi as recommended by the Civil Aviation Advisory Board would reduce the time occupied in transit from Cairo to Karachi from twelve to four days, and a natural extension of the line to Calcutta would effect a saving of five days on the existing service of eleven clays from Cairo.In assessiug the Imperial and economic value of air services such as these, it is the increased traffic which may be expected and not merely a proportion of existing traffic that demands attention. Increased commerce invariably follows improved means of communi-cation, and it is largely the time factor that prevents the business man in Great Britain from visiting Canada as he now visits France, or from travelling to Australia with the same frequency with which he now travels to the United States.To avoid any possibility of the unnecessary duplication of over-head charges, and to obtain the utmost economy in the operation of aircraft for purposes of Imperial commerce, it is, of course, desirable that there should be the highest possible degree of co-ordination consistent with such freedom of action as is necessary to meet local conditions.2. Survey. It is of importance that the Governments of the Empire should assist one another to systematise the development and operation of air survey services. In Great Britain the usefulness of such undertakings is for obvious reasons small, though even here commercial undertakings have appreciated its utility, and recently an aerial survey party was sent from London to the North of Ireland to carry out an aerial survey of Lough Neagh for a commercial firm undertaking hydro-electric power plant erection. In parts of the Empire, which possess territories as yet undeveloped, air survey undoubtedly offers advantages not yet fully realised. To air survey in Canada belongs the achievement of being the first aerial com-mercial undertaking to. reach an established self-supporting basis. On this service virgin forest country is photographed and the nature of timber subsequently classified with complete commercial accuracy. The presence of mineral oil in vegetated areas can be ascertained in the same manner. For geographical survey and mapping, air work can now be relied upon to give an accuracy of 99 per cent, as com-pared with land survey in country which is comparatively flat, and of 95 per cent, in mountainous country.Costs of initial equipment and of transport equipment call, haw-ever, for co-ordination of air survey schemes over large areas in order to bring overhead expenditure within reasonable limits. It is impossible, owing to variations in cost due to different geographical conditions, to lay down general estimates of the cost of aerial survey, but some idea of the saving effected by operation over large areas may be obtained from the fact that, at a rough estimate, the cost of an aerial survey of an area&apos; of 55,000 square miles would be 1/. per square mile, and if the area were 110,000 square miles the cost would be reduced to 14s. V)\d. per square mile.The machinery. for co-ordinating these Empire air services remains to be set up. Such co-ordination cannot, however, be fully achieved without co-operation for utilisation of Imperial equipment within the Empire.   This is not merely a matter of securing markets* In this latter connection it should he stated that recent night flying experiments demonstrated the complete practicability of commercial night flying in the absence of fog and low cloud.
within the Empire for Empire aircraft, hut it is essential with a view to securing mutual benefit from progress in. design, common operational practice, and the ultimate advantages of standardisation and interchangeability. But most important of all is a common realisation that the greatest value can be obtained for the air services of the Empire only by co-ordinated effort.April, 1923.Annex (A).Times taken in Transit on Umpire Routes.Service.London-Dublin London-Malta London-Cairof Mombasa...London-London-\ Zanzibar... f Karachi or&quot; \ Bombay London-Colombo London-Calcutta London-Kangoon London-Singapore ...
