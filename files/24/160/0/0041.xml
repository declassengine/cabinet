COMMITTEE   OF   HOME   AFP AIRS.EDUCATION (SCOTLAND) BILL. 1 note by the Secretary for Scotland.Clause 1.Under the operation of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1918, practically all Voluntary Schools in Scotland have been transferred to the Education Authorities.     As a safeguard to the former Managers, provision was made that the Schools should be carried on as before the passing of the Act for ten years.     Several cases have, however, occurred in which the former Managers were agreed that a School should he closed;    and the new provision simply allows of this being done where all parties are agreed. It is not expected that there will be any opposition to this change.Clause 2.At present Education Authorities are required to meet once a month, except that not more than one meeting need be held between the end of June and beginning of October.     Several of the Authorities are of opinion that less frequent meetings are now necessary,  and this sub-section will give them greater liberty.     As all travelling expenses and subsistence allowances are made from the funds of the Authority it is expected that considerable economies will also he effected.Clause 3.It has been found that the repeal of certain words relating to the provision for physically or mentally defective children effected in the Education (Scotland) Act, 1918, allowed greater power to Education Authorities than was intended.     This subsection.wi11 reimpose the necessary limitation, and it is not expected to be controversial,(Sgd.)   NOVAR,Scottish Office, Whitehall,12th May,  1923.
