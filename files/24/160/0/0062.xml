[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Maiesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1923.SECRET.CP. 263 (23).CABINET.SPECIAL REPORT  ON  UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 93.     Period ended June 1, 1923.The number of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as wholly unemployed at the 28th May was 1,221,340, an increase of 13,943 on the previous week.COAL-MINING.Full-time working has continued in the coal-fields in Lancashire, the Midlands and the Forest of Dean. Outputs have increased in the Welsh collieries, and progress has also been maintained in the Yorkshire and Durham fields. In Scotland, activity has continued.IRON AND STEEL.Unemployment is still prevalent in the Midlands, though a gradual improvement is noticeable. There has been some activity in the industry in the North-Western Counties, and in North Wales and certain districts of South Wales the recent improvement has been maintained. There appears to be no material change in the position in Yorkshire and the North-Eastern Counties. Prospects are not encouraging in the industry in Scotland, and the trade dispute in which the boiler-makers are concerned is affecting trade.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.The boiler-makers&apos; dispute is operating adversely on the Nbrth-Eastern Coast, and in Scotland, where the whole of the shipbuilding industry is seriously affected. On the other hand, the effect of the dispute on employment is not very marked in the North-Western shipyards, where the work is mainly repairing. The situation is depressed at the Welsh ports.ENGINEERING.Generally, there has been no material variation in the situation. Improvement, however, continues in the South-Western Counties, but there has been a falling off in activity in Yorkshire and the North of England. There has been no indication of any substantial improvement in the industry in Scotland.TEXTILES.Cotton. The position in this industry in Lancashire has remained practically unchanged, and organised curtailment of production continues. The industry in Yorkshire is very depressed.SUMMARY OF UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.
Hosiery, Woollen and Worsted. The unemployment- position in Yorkshire has become more unsatisfactory. A great deal of unemployment still exists in the Midlands, and there are no indications of early improvement. No appreciable change has occurred in Scotland, though there are signs of a slight tendency towards a decrease of employment.Lace. The position in the Midlands has been much the same, except for a falling off in the plain net sections. Work is more or less steady in the Somerset lace trade.Jute. As the result of negotiations, the jute dispute in Dundee has been narrowed down to one firm, and the bulk of the operatives will return to work immediately.BUILDING.Progress,has been reported generally, though there is still much unemployment, especially among unskilled workers.BOOT AND SHOE.In London, the improvement previously reported has been maintained. Unemployment is prevalent in the Midlands, though trade has been good at one or two centres.CLOTHING.Prospects in London and the Home Counties in certain branches of the clothing industry have been affected, by adverse weather conditions. In the South-Western Counties and in the Midlands, the position has fluctuated. Activities are reported from certain centres, while in others work is slack.POTTERY.While there is a slight tendency to improvement in the situation, unemployment is still extensive.TRANSPORT.Quietness exists at the London Docks. The usual seasonal passenger traffic has, however, increased activity on the Mersey, though the shortage of freight traffic continues. Depression at Avonmouth has been followed by a marked improvement, and an improvement has also occurred at Bristol. Trade at Southampton has been inactive. The position on the North-Eastern Coast has been favourably affected by the commencement of the timber-importing season.C. A. MONTAGUE UARLOW, Ministry of Labour.

[From Autumn 1920 onwards.] Cabinet Unemployment Committee,The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, the then Cabinet appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment. This Committee continued to function till October 1922. The present Government appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee on the 1st November, 1922.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, amalgamated the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extended until June 1923 the special periods during which benefit might be drawn.   The authority to borrow
money from -the Treasury was increased to  30,000,000. By the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1923, which came into operation on the 12th April, 1923, the special periods for the payment of benefit have been -extended to October 1923. Special provision has also been made by this Act for the following year to October 1924.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants), and the Contributions during the period from the 8th November, 1920, to the 26th.May, 1923. 1.

Ireland.(B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.A full.statement of the measures taken in the-autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from, autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this ^Report. At least 300,00.0.men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 146,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work /provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits Scheme.(C.) Extensions of Remedial Measures during the Winter 1922-23.Some of the measures comprised in (B) above are still.in operation, e-.g., past sanctions of grants by the Unemployed Grants Committee and the Ministry .of Transport. The Export Credits Scheme continues, and schemes approved under the Trade Facilities Act are in progress.In June 1922. the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport issued circular letters to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the relief of unemployment in their respective areas. Approved schemes are assisted by grants made on the same bases as heretofore. In the case of schemes -assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee, particulars of grants already !sanctioned are set out below.In September 1922, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circular letters to County Councils (except the&apos; London County Council) &apos;and Drainage Authorities, inviting them to submit schemes of land drainage which, if approved, might be assisted on fundamentally the same conditions as -those applicable in the[10117] b 3
case of schemes assisted last year. All applications were to be received in the case of Drainage Authorities on or before December 1, 1922, and in the case of County Councils (Agricultural Committees) on or before December 16, 1922. County Councils were also circulated with . regard to schemes&apos;for the supply of water to farms, the conditions of assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries remaining substantially the same as last winter, with the exception that the Ministry, instead of advancing the whole cost ol any scheme and recovering a proportion from the owners concerned, will make grants to cover part only of the total cost of each scheme. Further circulars, issued to County Councils and Drainage Authorities on the 5th and 6th December respectively, notified the extension of the date up to which applications might be received to the 13th January, 1923, and invited the submission of additional schemes. The- time for receiving applications was further extended provisionally to the 10th. February, 1923. Particulars of grants sanctioned and of the number of men employed to date are shown below (see table 6).On the 30th November, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, outlined, the manner in which measures taken by the late Government would be continued and extended. The additional sums promised in extension of existing funds are set out below : Unemployment Grants Committee (for grants on the basis of60 per cent, of Wages Bill)......         ...         ... 600,000Land Drainage          ...         ...         ...         ...         ... 170,000Afforestation.......         ...         ...         ...         ... 100,000Acceleration of Government contracts Office of Works    ... ...... 375,000 -General Post Office ... ... 946,000-     1,321,000It was also then announced that guarantees under the Trade Facilities Act Scheme would be made available up to  50,000,000 ( 25,000,000 extra); that the Export Credits Scheme would be extended if necessary; and that&apos; the Local Authorities concerned would be asked to co-operate in putting in hand the Manchester-Liverpool Road, which would involve an expenditure of about  3,000,000, half of it from the Road Fund.In December 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee issued a further circular letter to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes suitable for assistance on the basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill, i.e., works the cost of which is normally defrayed out of revenue and not by loan. The conditions under which grants may be sanctioned are substantially the same as those previously in force, except that in the case of Rural Districts the Committee have discretion to allow, where clearly necessary, a modification of the conditions regarding the giving of preference to 75 per cent, ex-service men and the engagement of labour through the Employment Exchanges.On the 12th December, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, further announced that, in addition to the acceleration of contracts by the Post Office and Office of Works, previously described, the Admiralty would accelerate miscellaneous works to a total of about  365,000; whilst the Home Office would put in hand certain accelerated building work, together with repairs to buildings, including Police Stations.On the 13th December, 1922, the Forestry Commission issued a press notice to the effect that forestry grants were available for the relief of unemployment on the same general conditions as those applicable to grants made last winter. The sum of  100,000 referred to above is to be used partly for this purpose and partly for . the purpose of relief schemes in Crown Forests and for additional work in the Commission^ forests by the Trade Facilities and Loans Guarantee Act, 1922 (Session 2), enacted on the 15th December, 1922, formal sanction was given for the increase of the aggregate capital amount of loans the principal or interest of which mav be guaranteed under the Trade Facilities Act, 1921, from  25,000,000 to  50,000,000.On the 15th February, 1923, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, announced an extension of  5,600,000 in the amount available for grants in respect of approved road works by the Ministry of Transport.
