THE COMOttlSTSThe Communist party has decided, in obedience to instructions sent out by the International Committee of Action in Bcsxlin, to extend its campaign against the occupation of the Ruhr until the one! of the month:   large quantities of the leaflets mentioned in last week&apos;e report have been distributed in the industrial districts and the current issue of &quot;Speakers Notes&quot; issued from headquarters deals with the same subject.Although numerous meetings have been held in London and the provinces the campaign can scarcely be termed a success: on April 22nd only about 500 people attended the Trafalgar Square meeting at which the speakers were ex-councillor Wall, J. J. vaughan, H. Young, Minnie Birch and J.T. Walton Nswbold, M.P.     All the speakers protested against the frenoh occupation of the Ruhr and Howbold dwelt on the &quot;menace of the 3V6cieti&quot;, a term which he applied to the Middle Classes&apos; Union and the Special Constabulary and their probable use in a railway strike which he prophesied would occur in the summer.Communists in the National Union of Railwaymen are doing their utmost to foment a strike atmosphere:   it is reported that in London arrangements for strike pickets are complete in ten branches and. In the country generally there seems to be a feeling that although a strike is undesirable the Executive must be obeyed if it calls the men out.The Communist pia*ty is circulating a number of pamphlets entitled &quot;The Real Position of Religion in Russia&quot; which have been issued by the Hands off Russia Couaittee &quot;for tho purpose of combatting the present agitation against Soviet Russia.&quot;On/
On April 18th S. JSafclatvala, M.P., speaking at a 1&apos;commnnist meeting held in the Salisbury Road School, Eilburn, at which about 600 people were present, stated that the workers of Great Britain missed their opportunity when the Russian revolution occurred in 1917 and they failed to enrol under the red banner of world revolution:   consequently the masters had acquired the ascendency and the workers would have to acquire the revolutionary spirit.   The masters realised the need for a united front and the workers would have   to realise it   or go under:   if one industry was on strike it was the duty of workers in that industry to stop work and help them.W.P. Earsman, the Australian communist, who was-recently in this ceuntry is now teaching politioal economy to the diplomatic section of the Military Academy in Moscow:   ha is also giving one lecture a week in the Eastern University and is &quot;udviser in solonial affairs&quot;.THE YQTJNG OOMMUglOT LEAGTfflIn a secret circular dated April 5th, 1923, theinformedExecutive Committee of the Young Communist International/national seotions that:&quot;The E.C. has decided to convene the Fourth International Bureau Session of the Y.C^I. for July 5th in Moscow.

An far as this can be done at the session, we intend to clarify the problem politically (tho various forms of co-ordination of legal and illegal activities) lu well as practically (witis-GHeee, codes, localities, etc. )&quot;The economic-trade union commission of tho Bureau Sousion will have to deal with the following tasks:   Discussion of the practical work in the trade unions and the shop councils1 movement, enumeration of the militant demands in the most important countries preparation for the economic-trace union activity and of the actions during the next si?; months, discussion of the forms of work in the red trade unions.&quot;Tho agrarian ccmmisBion must study the material prepared for the program of the Y.Col. and after this formulate the economic demands of the&apos; S.*ural proletarian youth.

Wo must again     repeat the instructions from our 3.0., namely:   NOT TO HCLD A LEACUE CONGRESS UNTIL AFTER THE BUREAU SESSION OP THE Y.C.I., BUT INSTEAD TO CALL A LEAGUE COUNCIL MEETING FOR WHITSUNTIDE.      It is essential that this be complied with.   Adequate preparations for a congress cannot be made in so short a time, particularly when there has been no nation-wide discussion on the decisions of the last congress of the Y.C.I.;   when you have to date not received the English translations containing those decisions so that your membership might be fully informed as to them;   and in conclusion when the matter of a program for the Y.C.I. will be finally passed upon only at the coming bureau session in July.&quot;We realize full well the tremendous tasks confronting your organization, and we do not want to see a congress held without adequate preliminary preparations for same, nor until our bureau session has held its meeting.&quot;In so far as you have no League Council members at the present time, we suggest that on the basis of reports received by your National Headquarters from the various districts, sour E.C. select six or seven comrades, one   from each important section of the country (Glasgow, Barrow, Manchester, Yorkshire, etc.) and that these be called to Laid on where they can meet with your E.C, trifl &apos;-;die most capable comrades in. the London district for a thoro discussion of the problems confronting the Y.C.L.; for obtaining a thoro report on the decisions of the last Y.CI. congress and how those decisions are to be brought Into effect;   as well as to take up the matter of preparing for the national congress.&quot;Hereafter be sure to give us notice as to when such important matters as national congresses and the like are to be held before you notify the membership about same.&quot;Wc trust that you will take immediate action on the matters herein mentioned, and inform us of same at once.&quot;We/
THE BED INTERHATIOHAL OF LABOUR UMIOHSIn the following secret circular dated Berlin, April 11th, 1923, the mia-European Bureau of the Red International of labour Unions notified all national sections that a meeting of the Central Committee will be held in Moscow on June 1st:&quot;Tho Secretariat of the K. I.L.U., Moscow, informs us, that according to the decision of the last meeting of the Executive, it was resolved to calla Meeting- of the Contra 1 Committee to Moo cow on june 1 etthe agenda of which is still going to be published.&quot;Delegations to this meeting are regulated by the following decision of the Second Congress of the R.I.L.U.National Federations witha membership from.........     5 to 50,000 send 1 del.&quot; 50   &quot; 200.000    &quot;   2    &quot;&quot; 300    &quot; 700-000    &quot;   3   &quot;&quot; 700   &quot; 2.000,000&quot;   4    &quot;&quot; more than2,000,000        &quot;   6   &quot;&quot;The same applies to the Minorities of the different countries.   All organisations of one and the same country which are connected with the R.I.L.U. send together one delegation.    The votes within this delegation are distributed in proportion with the membership of the organisations represented.&quot;We request all organisations to proceed immediately to the election and formation of their delegations, as well as to dispatch to us the names of the delegates.Each delegate must be in possession of   a mandate by his organisation.   The mandate has to contain mention of the membership represented as well as the stamp and signature of the respective Executive.Besides this you are requested to send us a detailed written report bejCoro the Meeting of the Central Committee, if possible in 3 copies.In this report the question of contributions towards the R.I.L.U. as well as of the Solidarity and fighting/&quot;Wo wish you every success in your wo tic ana assure you that the Ji!.C. of the Y.CI. will do all in its power to aid the English league in &quot;becoming a powerful factor for organizing the working class youth for the revolution.&quot;

I arj informed that some com-rade will probably seek an interview with me in the oourso of. a few days, but I havo no real assurance that it will actually come off, but stirring up what little optimism is left in me, I venture to say that such may possibly materialise.&quot;Wat kins has instructed Galls; cher to take with him when he goes to Moscow at the end of this month &quot;ell accounts and all data to enable him to deal with any questions which may arise.&quot;As an example of the interest taken by the Red Interna-cional of Labour Unions in the industrial position in this country mention may be made of the faot that in the issue of the Rotas Gfuwrkschafts-Eulletin for April 21st (published by the Mid-European Bureau) the strike a or unrest among the following British v;orkers are detailed:Railway/
railway-shopmen, seamen (Southampton), stokers (Glasgow), juteworkers, builders, pottery workers, boilermakers and engineers(North Shields), farm workers (Norfolk), milkman (London),chemical workers and teachers (Croydon).propaganda among the seamen is receiving special attention:International Propaganda Committees of Marino Transport workers have been set up at Rotterdam, Hamburg, Petersburg and 06b esaand the British Bureau of the Rod International of LabourUnions has been informed that:&quot;The aim of it is to give the seamen of the world a home where they can find advice and support by their struggle for a better life.&quot;Seamen joint this needfull work by visit our hall, when you arrive at Rotterdam.&quot;^bornforttible reading and conversation room give you an opportunity to strength the international companionship and solidarity.11John Campbell, the secretary of the /:nglc-*Saxon section of the Port Bureau of Hamburg is in touch with MacManus 1 brother &quot;Jim Anderson&quot; and has asked him to forward the publications of    j all British sea-faring unions.Among seamen in this country, particularly those connected with the Amalgamated Marine Workers&apos; Union and the &quot;Workers1 aolidarity League&quot; there are signs of activity: the main cause of unrest appears to be np.C.5.n:     in Liverpool McQuiggua, Petor Lark in, Hiold, HoSley, alias 0&apos;Hagan and J. Flood are reported to have been responsible for the strike of coloured seamen.In Lone&quot;! on si so there have been small disputes in the course of which men have refused to sign on the S.S* &quot;Oratava&quot; and the S.S. &quot;Yasconia&quot;.tom mannOn April 12th Tom Mumi sent the following interesting letter to Losovsky:
&quot;Dear Comrade Loeovski,&quot;I wish to send you a personal account of my visit to South Africa and to tell you how I am occupied now.&quot;I consider I t&quot;:id wisely by responding to the invitation of the S. African co; races and visiting them after they had undergone such a punishing.   The treatment of the mine Owners and the government, was as viscious as anything that has happened in any Country.   it was at the inception, purely an industrial struggle, by the Miners Union refusing to accept of the lower standard the Capitalist demanded:   because the men showed such organised efficiency, the picketing being very efficient, and the fooa supply equal to requirements, it became necessary for the Government to cane to the aid of the Capitalists, and to declare Martial Law, then it became an easy matter to provoke the men to reply to the shooting that the Military forces indulged in, and so give colour to the necessity for the Government to &quot;restore order&quot;. The young Dutchman on strike ^ere very courageous,   and were able to get unlimited food supplies from the Dutch farmers, who were hoping the strike would clovelop into a Hafcionsi Movement to overthrow the governmanc, but of course the Dutch are not Communists, and such a change as they favoured would not have materially advanced the movement,&quot;Ten thousand men were arrested and balf of these were detained for trial.    it gave the autho :ij t jo t the opportunity of imprisoning all these men who bad shewn courage and ability in the movement, and rate x ally feu is left the situation in a very poor condition from a Labour standpoint.&quot;I had excellent meetings in spite of this, and did much to cheer up and stimulate the workers to further efforts*&quot;The active problem, that is, the presence of the black population in the proportion of IV &amp; to one of the whites, o explicates matters very much.    Only the most intelligent of the whites regard the blacks - Kaffirs as they are called - in the light of fellow humans, having rights and responsibilities.&quot;Che coloured population, meaning the offspring of blacks and whites1, are another complication making it more then usually difficult to obtain solidarity.&quot;Tho coivgaunists in Johannesburg miss no opportunity of pointing out the lessons of the developing Capitalist System, but I am quite sure nothing will serve such a good purpose as that we in Britain should set the right example.&quot;In this regard, since my return from 8. Africa, I have been occupied as far as possible in a vigorous campaign amongst all sections of British Workers;   and it is my intention to continue this in all parts of the Country, knowing that  t-hio will produce best results.   I am therefore holding meat lugs amongst the miners of County Durhum and south wales;   amongst the Engineers and Cotton operatives in Lancashire and Cheshire, and amongstthe/
the workers in the Pottery Trades of Staffordshire, I am specially advocating a General strike of all trades to put a stop to the wage reductions and the increase of working hours as demanded hy the Capitalists, and to unify the advanced men in the movement on a militant basis.&quot;You may rest assured the bast possible is being done, and allowing for the meagre opportunities by slender resources.&quot;But we are really staking up the workers.   On Saturday of this week we are holding an R.I.I.U. Conference and we know it will be well attended.&quot;During the 1-ibt few days Comrade W tklns and myself have been with the Unemployed in their Conference at Coventry and put the case for the R.I.I.U.&quot;I hope you sre enjoying very good health and am exceedingly soarry as we all are to know that our dear Comrade Lenin its seriously ill.&quot;My very kindest regards to youSincerely and Fraternally yours,Tom Mann.&quot;TUB unemployed on April 16th the lone-on District Council of the organisedunemployed met in the Brotherhood Church, Southgate Road., andre-elected the following officials:Chairman: E.M. StrakerOrganiser: G.E. SoderborgSecretary: H.E. MartinMinute Sec.: A.

IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAINExcept as regards their propaganda Department, Irish Republicans in this country are practically inactive.   The propaganda section is still carrying on mainly through the medium of &quot;Eire&quot;, published in Glasgow but circulated through various agenoiee both here and abroad.   In this direction there appears to be no lack of funds or material:   something like 900 copies are disposed of each week in London,The &quot;fighting&quot; section is extremely quiet and, with the exception of one or two militant priests who appear to have stepped into the breach, has no real leaders.    One of these, Father 0&apos;Ooimell of Bermondsey, spoke at a meeting held on April 21st at the Bermondsey Town Hall, to protest against the importations.   Dr. Suiter, M.P., the principal speaker having, amidst much interruption, stated that the Free state being now on top, it was not advisable to continue active resiatence, was followed by Father 0&apos;Oonnell who was introduced as a. co-worker of Archbishop Mannix, and Father DominicThe Reverend gentleman while agreeing with Dr. Salter, from a religious point of view, pointed out that the early Christian did not compromise   with the Romans, and the Irish Eepublioan Army would not compromise with the Free Staters. Dr. Salter had expressed the hope that he would live long enough to see a Republic in Ireland, but he (Father 0&apos;Connell) knew there was one there now, end had been since 1916.leading Irishmen, in close touoh with events in Ireland, speak in very hopeful terms of the situation there.   They say that, with anything like a reasonable run of luck the military side of the revolt should be crushed by the early summer:     the people are every day becoming more and moreconfident/
confident of the stability of the Free state Government, and tho supply of reliable information as to rebel movements is accordingly increasing.In Eepublioan circles here the general opinion is that the time to call a halt has now arrived;   to persist would only mea:r/fche loss of more valuable lives and would probably kill the Republican cause for all time.The Advisory committee has recommended the release of two of the women, deportees, Miss Finan and Mi as Pur long of Liverpool, both of them deeply implicated in Republican plots. Of the two, pur long- Is probably the worse, although the evidence against her was weak:   she may cause further trouble.A good deal of dissatisfaction is expressed at tho lack of interest displayed by the Irish Labour P^rty on the importation question,   The &quot;Voice of Labour&quot; absolutely ignores it.   As thiB week&apos;a &quot;Workers Republic&quot; outs it:   &quot;The Irish Labour Party has got a yellow streak in it, and got it badly&quot;.Gonmunlets on the other hand are playing up to the IriehRepublicans, and profess to have their interest greatly atheart.  .Their latest move is a warning from Headquarters inLondon that:-&quot;As soon as the government have completed the&quot; arrangements, there is going to be another Sinn Fein rouna up in England, more general than the last. Meeting places and private residences will be searched and all books etc. seized.   All persons implioatod will be aeported.&quot;The Government have an order prepared to be put into operation Immediately after the round up, that Irish undesirables In England are no longer to receive the &quot;dole&quot; or relief from the Guardians of the poor. They are to be told to go back to Ireland, their own country.&quot;Some of the Glasgow Roman catholic Clergy are taking strong measures to prevent the distribution of Irish Bepublioan literature at the Church doors on Sundays.   On April 15th, Father Lawton of St, Rochels,. Garngaa Road, usedphysical/
- ISphysical force to remove two Republicans who were distributing bills outside his church, and as a consequence had to submit to a good deal of violent language from Republican sources. On April 22nd Mrs. Hutohinson and Oiasie Callan, leading members of the Cumann-na-mBoJi attended for the same purpose and a stormy, scene ensued;   they were attacked by about fifty women of the parish who threw them to the ground and nearly tore the clothes off their backs.   They had to be rescued by the police and escaped, much the worse for wear, on a passing tram car, hotly pursued by a crowd of infuriated women,,
The Chief Constable of Horfolk has sent me thefollowing report regarding the situation among the Norfolkfarm workers:   it is a continuation of the information given as an appendix to Report lio. 201.&quot;Tiie arrival of the outside Police had an instant effect, especially as by this date 1 began to get oases into Court for intimidation and hindering men from working.&quot;Within two days of the arrival of the first extra Constables , the movement of gangs of men who were out for Intimidation, had entirely stopped. At the end of one week 1 sent home one third of each detachment and during last week another third.     The whole of the remainder returned to their own stations to-day, as the Strike was settled on Saturday.&quot;1 very much doubt, however, if matters will pass off quietly yet, as 1 hear so many of the farmers will refuse to take back ail the men they were employing before the Strike. In so many oases the Farmers keep on more men than they really require at this time of year, but as the men went on strike, they will not all oome back. This will lead to trouble, but one cannot blame the farmer.&quot;1 have had telephone messages in from several places this morning already, that the men all 6ame back this morning to work and the farmers told them only so many could return.     Thereupon all the men went out on strike again.&quot;Again there are some 1,500 &quot;Federation&quot; men imported by the Farmers&apos; Federation to work the essential parts of the farms.     Most of these men have to be given a week1s notioe.     Ho arrangement appears to have been made by Messrs. Gosling and German, when settling the terms of the strike settlement, for this point of the Federation men1s notioe.     1 feel sure this will lead to trouble.&quot;1 might add that during last week, as the days went on, more and more men were returning to work on the farms, and though, I doubt if the strike would have oome to an end for weeks in the parts of Norfolk between FaJcenham and Oastleaore, 1 think in other parts the bulk of-the strikers would have been back to work in most places by the end of this week.     Many were back by last Friday.&quot;AFPE3D1X.
