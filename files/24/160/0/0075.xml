DOOUMEHT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERMEET. , -Oi A B I I E T.ggorgt. ^TETEMPBOYMFirT OOMMITTBE. &apos;-f hg&quot;.py &quot;576/83. &apos;  .&quot; aMemorandum, by the President of the Board of Trade.I have during the past months circulated regularly to the Committee and to the Cabinet the review of trade prospects which Is given to me In confidence by the Advisory Council of the Board of Trade each month.   The attached memorandum summarises the views expressed by this Advisory Council at their meeting yesterday.   The concensus of opinion expressed by this representative body is ao serious that I feel it ought to be available to my colleagues on the Unemployment Committee at their meeting to-morrow.The.Report speaks for itself.     It bears out most unpleasantly the fear I expressed some months ago to the Committee that a failure to arrive at a settlement of Reparations, accompanied by general uncertainty, fluctuation in prices, and the impediment   caused to the flow of world trade, would create a situation in which any temporary advantage accruing to sections of British Industry would be far outweighed by the general dislocation and hold-up of trade.     This forecast is emphatically endorsed by the practical experience of tho members of my Advisory Council.     The same view has been^ expressed to me by all other traders and financiers I have been able to consult.The Unemployment Committee have, therefore, to face-a situation in whioh, unless a general settlement inEurope is raaohed within the next month or two, the seasonal unemployment of the winter months will be aggravated by a serious trade depression.p.llc 14. 6. 23.
OOlTFI DEHTIAL.A.O. 133.BOARD OP TRAPS ADVISORY COUNCIL. * u xDraft Minutes of the 32nd Meeting of the Advisory Council to the Board of Trade, held at Great George Street, Westminster, on Wednesday, 13th June, 1923, at 10.30 a.m.There were present:-The President of the Board of Trade (in the Chair),Colonel 0,0, Armstrong, D.S.O.,Hon. Cecil Baring,Sir A, Shirley Benn, K.B.B.,M,P.,Mr, J,R, Brooke, O.B.Sir W.H. Clark, K.0.S.I .,C,M,G.Sir Robert Glanfield,Sir Gilbert E,A, Grlndle, K,0.M.G.,CB.,Mr. Hugo Hirst,Mr. F. Holroyd,Sir Frederick W. Lewis Bart,,Mr, John Sanderson,Mr, H, Sutoliffe Smith,Sir Edwin Stockton, M,P.THE TRADE OUTLOOK.The President invited the members of the Council present to express their views with regard to the trade position now and in the near future, and said he anticipated a more gloomy forecast than In previous months.   He would be glad to hear members1 opinions as to the oauees to whioh this general set-back (if they considered that suoh had taken plaoe) should be asoribed, and particularly how far they considered it attributable to the existing political and economic situation in Europe.Mr. Baring (Director of Baring Brothers and Company) said that he oould see no expansion of trade, but rather a reduotion.5 the demand from tlve United States whioh had been noticeable two months ago, had slackened, In consequence probably of the surplus of gold existing in the United States and their high tariff; buyers were hesitating on account of high prices.   The result was recorded in the deoline in the dollar exchange, which had fallen some 2fo to Zfo from the   high point whioh it attained at the end of February,   He thought that we could be satisfied if our currency maintained its value In the United States for the present,
a q 9in view of the magnitude of the adverse faotors. lJtUwThe President remarked that in the United States prosperity appeared to be continuing, prices were rising and there was a shortage of workers; he asked Mr.Baring how he would reconcile this with the holding back cn the part of United States purchasers,Mr,Baring^ replied that a certain amount of American buying of raw material was taking place, but it was natural that they would not buy our manufactures freely at present high prices.   The demand for raw materials was apt to be fitful; thus, there had been a certain amount of buying of edible oils by the United States on account of a shortage of butter, whioh was afterwards rectified by importation of butter from Australia and the Argentine, with the result that the.wholesale price of butter in the States went down some 20%.   The buying of these oils was therefore, a short lived and isolated venture.Under present conditions every buyer would prefer tc buy from hand to mouth in the smallest possible quantities, on account cf high prices.   Hesitation was being produced in.other countries, not on account of a surplus of gold, but of a surplus of paper; such countries found our prices prohibitive on account of the depreciation of their exchange,   wherever a country was contracting her currency and paying her debts, stagnation of trade was the result.   He considered that we should have to be content to stand by and watch this process for some time. Meanwhile the countries concerned had to be satisfied with inferior goods,The money market was still rather gorged with money which ought to be employed ir. trade.   It was difficult to account satisfactorily for a certain break at the present time; he recognised that there was such a break.   The temper of the financial market showed that the opinion was generally held that prices were too highu   He anticipated higher rates in the money market in the autumn.
CONFIDENTIAL.If the Reparation question were settled the sentimental effect at least would bo great.   The stabilisation of the German exchange was, however, what was principally wanted; the Austrian rate appeared already to have been stabilised.   He would look for a rapid rehabilitation of trade if the Mark were stabilised.The present prosperity in the United States was, he thought, a hot-house growth.   People out there found themselves compelled to buy, irrespective of the tariff, and violent fluctuations were the result.   The United States&apos; appetite for foreign investments appeared to have worn off, and the idea that they would buy European securities largely had been falsified.1    Mr. Hirst, (Chairman   and Managing Director of the General Electric Company, Limited) said that there had been a steady and continued improvement in the electrical industry from September 1922 to March last, and as a result, employment, which had been reduced to 50$ of the normal, had risen again to 80$ by the end of March.   Since March, however, there had been a distinct hold-up of business, and unless an improvement took place, discharges of employees would become necessary during the next few months.   Ho asoribed this to two oauses, (l) artificially high prices on account of the German demand for coal, resulting in high prices for steel, and (2) the political uncertainty in regard, to the Ruhr and Turkey, whioh had taken away the confidence that had appeared to be returning.   If the question of the Ruhr could be settled, the direct effect might be injurious to the electrical industry owing to revived German competition; yet he thought that if German purchasing power could be re-established it would re-act favourably upon trade as a whole, and the electrical branches would also participate in the Improved conditions.   For the moment there was a hold-up both in home and foreign orders,
though the latter had begun to revive a few months ago.The Ruhr situation had held up the flow of trade, and W6 were failing to get orders from oountries whioh should have been selling their produce to Europe.Sir Robert Glanfield (Chairman of George Glairfield and Sons, Limited, London, Wholesale Clothing Manufacturers) said he had little ohange to report in the wholesale clothing trade   what little there was, was for the worse.     The home trade was poor on account of the weather, and it was an ominous sign that home manufaoturers in the North were more than anxious for business. Retailers were not cheerful at present, and wholesalers were holding stocks whioh had been produced in anticipation of good business to come.     If the weather improved, stocks might be moved, but the orders which had been placed in advance were not encouraging.     The export trade was still bad, though the demand from South Africa had improved slightly.Sir Edwin Stockton, -.M.P., (of Abbott and Stockton, Cloth merchants, Manchester; President of The Manchester Chamber of Oommeroe) said that no improvement had taken plaoe in cotton textiles since the last Meeting;   if anything, there had been a set-back.     A considerable advanoe had taken place in the price of the raw material, and spinners had fixed artlfiolal basic prices whioh they wore trying to get people to pay.     There was a struggle between buyer and sellerj   but there would be a big demand if only prices were reasonable.     The fact that there had been a fall In forward prioes accentuated the present tendenoy to hold off, since, with that knowledge buyers would not come forward to/pay the present fiotitious basic
prices.   He was convinced, however, that there waa business to be done and that the markets were in need of goods.   A real improvement could not be hoped for until conditions became more normal.   At present only hand to mouth buying of cdd lotswp.s taking place, and this was not sufficient to keep trade going.   A large   amount of machinery was idle in oonaequence. He thought that *nly the prooesa of time oould remedy this state of affairs.Reports from India were good and markets there were improving, but they still were holding off for lower prioes.The President said he had heard that buying in China was better until the recent unfortunate incident on the railways.Sir.Edwin Stockton   replied that prospects in China were undoubtedly better, but there too, buyers were holding back. India must, he thought, be very short of stocks and China still more so.Colonel Armstrong (Past President of the Council of the Federation of British Industries; Chairman of Greenwood &amp; Batley Ltd., Engineers, Leeds) said that the general engineering position was bad.   Some orders were being reoeived for textile machinery, and for boilers, but the general industry was very slack. Intending purchasers of machinery both at home and abroad wore holding their hand at present, and would not launoh out until they could see some tendency towards improvement in the situation. He was afraid that the process of revival would take longer than had originally been anticipated.Speaking as for the Federation of British Industries,with regard to industry in general, Colonel Armstrong said that, while there still seemed to be a certain amount of optimism in some quarters there was no steady all-round improvement? suoh Improvement as was taking place waa sporadio and did not aeem to touch the whole mass of trades.
pj2KPIDBi!3TIAL. , nr*4 6 bMr.t Sander-son   (Sanderson Murray &amp; Elder, Limited, Australasian Merchants representing Australia on The Advisory Council) Baid that the drought in Australia had broken,   and that there had been good rains all over the oastern t&amp;p^ of the country.   It was rather too soon to estimate the amount of. damage which the drought had done, but at all events prospects were now good.   The period of most active export trade was now practically finished for this year.   Labour troubles In the coal-mining industry were continuing, though there seemad now to be some; hope that the end of them was in sight.   Among the smaller articles of export to this country, apples and other fruit were benefiting to some extent on account of the weather here, which had delayed British fruit.   There had been a rise in butter prices.   The general position was at least as good as last year.Mr. gatcliffe Smith (Textiles? Bradford Dyers&apos; Association) said that there was much depression in the textile industry, only 50% of looms being In work.   Better cables were being received from the eastern markets, but prices were still too high for them. French competition was not now quite so severe as it had been, since they had exhausted their stocks of cheap wool and were now having to buy at higher prices.   He noted that the situation which had been produced by the tariff concessions granted by Canada to the French wa3 now to be remedied by the new Canadian Budget.With regard to the yarn trade, he considered that there would be an active demand if political conditions in Europe could be settled and the exchanges stabilised.   At present there was a general feeling of degression and many manufacturers were weaving for stock.The President asked what view was taken as to the future oourse of wool prioes.Sir Robert Glanfield - replied that Sir A. Goldfinoh had told him he anticipated a considerable rise.
Mr *i Sut o1iffe , Smj th said he was inclined to agreej   he thought that wool prices would tend to rise on account of shortage produced by the big demand from the United States.Mr. Holroydi (Cottoni   Director of R. and J. Holroyd, Limited, Halifax;   Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations and Federation of British Industries) said he oould eonfirm Sir Edwin Stockton&apos;s remarks.     He thought there was practioally no prospeot of improvement, and feared that the prioe of raw material would increase considerably during the next month or two, on aoocunt of the awkward position of spinners who had bought large stocks forward.     He observed that it was the praotioe of spinners to sell their futures in Liverpool as security against loss.     In this way they had Bold considerable quantities, but would now have to buy them back again, as no further supplies were ooming forward.   This would probably produoe a severe financial stringency towards the end of the autumn.     Under present oiroumstanoes the foreigner would naturally net buy;   but even if he bought now for February delivery, spinners would not be making a profit on tho transaction.     It was, however, satisfactory to be able to report that an agreement had been reached with the operatives in regard to wagesj   there was to be no alteration for nine months) at the end of that time the employers were to have the right to ask, if necessary, for a reduotion, while the operatives on their side oonsented not to ask for an advance for eighteen months.The present political situation was, he thought, against us, especially as regards the Ruhr and in China.     Were it not for these politioal difficulties, he was of opinion that China would be an active buyer.     He mentioned that he had recently attended a meeting of the International Cotton Federation at Lucerne and had there spoken to Dutoh, Belgian and czecho-Slovak
CONFIDENTIAL. &apos; R Q0------ 46orepresentatives, who had remarked on the lenient attitude with regard to repayment of debts whioh we seemed to adopt towards our Allies.SlrnFrederick Lewis, (Shippings   Chairman of Furnoss Withy and Oompany) said that he oould report nothing satisfactory in regard to the Shipping industry, whioh had never found itself in a worse situation than to-day. Freights wore below the level of 1913, while shipowners&apos; expenses were double.     Grain, the principal oommodlty of interest to them was at present praotically stagnant. There was no speculation and no trade, and only hand-to-mouth buying was taking plaoe.     He had recently returned from a visit to the United States, where a great internal boom was taking plaoe.     He thought that hitherto our exports to the States had been maintained, notwithstanding the tariff, but agreed with the view taken by our Ambassador at Washington that the States oould take evon more goods from us.     There was a general impression ofat there that there would be considerable labour difficulties Bhortly.     The United States Ministry of Labour wished, he understood, to reduce the quota of immigrants admitted annually from South Eastern Europe and to Increase the proportion from Northern Europe and the United Kingdom, and they wore preparing a Bill for this purpose.     This Bill would contain a clause allowing the wives and families of immigrants to be admitted in addition to the quota for eaoh oountry.     The measure oould, however, not be introduced before next December, and would probably take a year to pass into law.With regard to tho position of the sterling exchange in the States, he had formed the opinion that Its comparative steadiness was due, at any rate in part, to the rum-running traffio, which was to the value of some  5,000,000 per month.
CONFIDENTIAL. 489He had been a report In the &quot;Times&quot; that the Shipping Board were going tosorap 5,000,000 tons of their shipping. Mr. Lasker had admitted in conversation with him that 5,000,000 tons were useless, but as these vessels had been laid up for some tim past, this would have no praotioal effeot on the shipping position.   Four hundred and fifty ships were left in the Shipping Board&apos;s hands.   Mr. Lasker said that he had advertised these for sale to United States private Interests for specified trades, putting in a condition that buyers should undertake to operate them in these trades for at least three years.   So far, however, offers had not been forthcoming on these terms. Mr. Lasker had stated that if this failed the Shipping Board would pursue &quot;an aggressive shipping policy&quot;, presumably by means of Government operation and subsidies.Sir Frederick Lewis also said that he had spoken to the United States President, Mr. Harding, and had understood from him that the United States Government were considering whether aotion could not be taken to enlarge the present facilities for immigration from this country.   It appeared, therefore, that the President was proposing to support some proposals suoh as those contemplated by his Ministry of Labour.As regards ehip-building, Sir Frederick had no first hand information, but thought that there could be no great activity, ho much shipping being already laid up.   Any building there was would be for Diesel engines.   As to ship repairing, our costs were still too high, and much of this work was going to the Continent.Sir A./Shirley Benn, M.P. (President, Association ofBritleh Chambers of Commerce) said that the opinion expressedby those who had recently been abroad was that a restorationof our trade oould not be expected till the situation&apos;in the ruhr had been cleared up; they said that the present position there oould not oontinue for another six months,- either theFrench would find themselves compelled to advance again, or else the question must be settled.-9-
In addition, the following remarks in regard to the trade outlook had been received from members who wore, unable to be present:-Mr. Murray (Commerce: Messrs, Ker Bolton and Company, Glasgow, East India lierohant) tolegraphed: &quot;Position Par. Eastern markets improving but buying both of textiles and rough goods still limited owing Eastern dealers belief that costs this side must oome down&quot;.Mr. Watson (General Manager, London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company) wrote:-&quot;With regard to the Trade Outlook, assuming the LondonMidland and Soottieh Railway position as being typioal ofthat of the Railways of the oountry generally, the following(relating to the Company mentioned) are the approximatepercentages of increases in Mores handiso, Minerals and coal and Coke for the  .17 weeks ended 29th April, 1923, comparedwith the corresponding period in 1922:-RAILWAY   TONNAGES.Goods Train Tonnage.increase over 19&quot;22.Merchandise................... 4.0$Ooal Class..................... 6.2$Other Minerals................ i 43.6^Total for all goods. 9.0$Mr. Evan Williams (President, Mining Association of -Groat Britain) sent a message to the effeot that he had nothing fresh of Importance to report with regard to the ooal trade, exoept that export conditions wore weaker.
