(CP. 168(23)    ) S (CP. 180(23)    )MEMORANDUM   BY   THE   MINISTER   OP   LABOUR.1.     I attach a Report of the proceedings of tho Eighteenth Session of the   Governing Body of tho International Labour Office, Geneva, at which Mr, Bettorton, Parliamentary Secretary to tho &quot;Ministry of Labour, represented tho British Government.2.     The principal business of the meeting, which ended on the 13th April, was tho establishment of tho 1924 Budget of the Office, and the statement below summarises tho revised estimates provisionally adopted by a majority of the Governing Body.Swiss francs.Description.1924 original Budget.1924Directors revision of Budget.1922 actual expenditure.1924Budget provision-ally adopted by Governing Body.erial Subheads ffsial provision unforeseen snditure and atriation.3,694,750*12,904,000* ! 2,878,877 5,484,030 14,426,600    j  4,426,5002,274,000* 4,426,600350,000 7,050,600otalt9,118,730:7,330,600   j  7,305,477*   These figures include the provision of 75,000 francs for an Office which is to be established at Tokyo.3.     It will be seen that in place of the sum of 9,118,780 Swiss francs originally proposed by the Director of the International Labour Office, a sum of 7,050,600 francs was provisionally adopted by the Governing Body as compared with/the
the 6,250,000 francs indicated in the Cabinet&apos;s deoisionon the 28th Maroh as a maximum for the effective budget of the Offioe.   It should be noted, however, that thesum of 4,426,600 franos included for staff is tho sumactually expended in 1922 - the expenditure undor this heading for the ourrent year is estimated to amount to4,776,000 franos - and the Direotor has been instruotedto present to the Governing Body, at its meeting on the12th June next, proposals for a reduotion of the 1922expenditure based on a re-organisation of the staffingof the Offioe.It should bo observed further that a considerable proportion of the 350,000 franc3 for contingency, say200,000 was intended for compensation for los3 of offloe.It was contemplated previously that any sums required for compensation on abolition of posts to secure eoonomymight, if necessary, be agreed to in addition to a budget of 6,250,000 Swiss francs.     It will be seen, therefore,that this 200,000 can properly be deduoted from thefigure of 7,050,600 as the effective expenditure for1924 and leaves a total of 6,850,600.4.     The Parliamentary Secretary, at an early stage ofthe proceedings expressed the view that the totaleffective budget of the Office ought to be limited to6,000,000 francs.    At the final voting therefore, whenhe agreed to tho sum of 7,050,600 franos referred toabove as a provisional figure, Mr. Betterton made thefollowing declaration :-&quot;if sufficient economies on staff are not realised, it may be necessary to see whether further economies oannot be obtained by a still closer scrutiny of those Subheads (i.e., for Materials) without hampering the work of the Offioe any more than tho present financial stringency renders absolutely necessary&quot;./It
It was further made quite clear that the British Government was in no way oommittod to agreement to thn Budget as a whole, and that if ultimately it readied a figure outside the limit oonsiderod reasonable by the Government as a result of the revised staff proposals, the British Government reserved full liberty of aotion at the next meeting of the Governing Body and elsewhore,5,     It is understood that the Director and the Deputy Direotor of the Office will shortly proceed to London to submit revised proposals as regards the staffing of the Offioe.I will report further to the Cabinet if necessary whon I have received theae proposals.(Intd) M. B.3rd May, 1923.
CONFIDENTIAL.I .L.C.184.INTERNATIONAL LABOUR -COMMITTEE.Note on the proceedings of the Eighteenth Session of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office April, 1983, at Geneva./NOTE:    The following report of the Proceedings at the Eighteenth Session of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, circulated for the information of members of the International Labour Committee, is prepared in the light of the daily communiques issued in the course of the Session and the notes made by representatives of Gt. Britain who attended the Session^y1. Matter3 arising out of theDirector1s Report. (a) Eighf hour convention.Mr. Poulton, the Workers&apos; representative from Gt. Britain, called attention to the fact that certain States, while adopting an eight-hour day, hesitated to ratify the convention and tie their hands for 10 years and that such an important industrial State as Gt. Britain, where the eight-hour- day was practically universal, had not found it possible formally to ratify the convention.     He accordingly put in a motion instructing the Director to get into touch with the Minister of Labour in Gt. Britain, pointing out the obligations entered into by the Government Delegates at Washington, and endeavour to ascertain when it was likely that the convention would be ratified.. In the course of diooussion it was mentioned that
 neither Germany, France nor Japan had ratified the convention in question, and that the British Government had proposed to include in the Agonda of a future conference the question of amending the convention in certain respects.

After considerable discussion the Governing Body decided to set up a Committee of a Chairman and nine members whose duty it would be to present to the Governing Body at their next Session suggestions as to the best moans? of securing the widor ratification of the convention. The Committee is to consist of the following members :-

M. Fontaine (France) - Chairman of the Governing Body.

Government Reprpsentatives.

Mr. Bettorton (Gt. Britain), Mr. Adatci (Japan)and M. De Michelis (Italy).

Employers&apos; Representatives.

M. Pinot (France), M. Olivetti (Italy) and M. Hodacz (Czeche-Slovakia).

Workers&apos; Representatives.

Mr. Poulton (Gt. Britain), M. Jouhaux (France)and M. Leipart (Germany).

(Each member may be replaced by a duly appointed substitute).

(b) Eight-hour day in Italy.

The Italian Government representative explained that In Italy two decrees had been issued, the first establishing nationally an eight-hour day in industry, commerce and a part of agriculture and the second authorising the Italian Government to ratify the Washington convention. These  two decrees will appear forthwith in the official Italian Ga?otte.


(c) Obligations under Article 405.The Governing Body decided to remind all the States&apos; Members of the Organisation of the obligation imposed upon them by Article 405 of the Peace Treaty to submit to their competent authorities draft conventions and recommendations adopted by the International Labour Conferences within a period of 12, or in exceptional cases 18. months from the date of the closing of the Session in which the draft convention or recommendation were adopted.(d) Meeting of experts on disabled questions.The Governing Body decided by a majority of 13 to 8 to reply favourably to the request of the various National Disabled Men&apos;s Associations asking for a meeting of experts to be convened in order to study the question of placing disabled men in employment and of making available for the various Governments and Associations the experience obtained in the various countries.Discussion on the proposal to subscribe   10,000 francs to the International Institute of Prosthesis at Brussels was deferred until the next Session.(9) Agreement between the Offioe and the International Maritime Committee.The Governing Body approved the agreement arrived at between the Director and the International Maritime Committee regarding collaboration between the two organisations aad the dofinition of their respective functions. (f) Meeting of Government Statisticians.The Governing Body agreed to there being convened a meeting of Government Labour Statisticians who would endeavour to arrive at an agreement as to the possibility of making
International Labour statistics uniform in order to permit of international comparison. It was suggested by the British Government Representative that this body should also endeavour to define tho extent to which it was desirable for the International Labour Organisation to limit its work in compiling or collecting international statistics. It was agreed that on this occasion States represented at the Conference should be asked to pay the expenses of their representatives.

2. Annual Conference.

The proposal to postpone tho 1923 Annual Conference until the Spring of 1924 was not adopted by tho Governing Body but a compromise was effected by which a conference lasting no longer than a week will be begun on Monday, 22nd October, 1923, to discuss one item only viz., the determination of general principles of Factory Inspection. The possibility of inviting Governments to include in their Delegations members qualified to discuss the statistical aspects of factory inspection is to be examined by the Director, as also the desirability of inviting the Government Delegates and others to devote a portion of the Conference to the general principles of industrial safety.

The 1924 Conference will begin in the second fortnight of June, when tho questions to be discussed, in addition to those set out in paragraph 2 (c) of I.L.C. 171, will include the prohibition of night work in bakeries.     The Governing Body will suggest to the conference that its work in this connection should be limited to examining the question in general and that a
rvote on the adoption of a draft convention or re-oommetMla-tion should be roflervod for a future onnference,The British Gkrrecnjmoint Representative proposed to include also in the Agenda of the 1904 Conference, the subject of disinfection from anthrax of wool, hair,, bones, horns and hoofs.     An Amendment was proposed by Sir Louis Kershaw to the effect that the Governing Body should merely refer to the Conference the report of the Advisory Committee on Anthrax and aek the conference to decide what action should be taken as a result of that report.     The Amendment was carried by 13 votes to 11, the British Government Representative voting &quot;in the minority. 3. Estimates for 1904.Prolonged and detailed oenoideration of the Estimates for IS34 was given by the Finance Committee before the Governing Body itself met.     The Budget a3 finally adopted by the Governing Body amounts to 7,050,000 franos as compared with 9,110/780 franc3 originally proposed by the Director.     In the new Budget the figure for salaries of staff at Geneva is 4,426,000 francs as compared with 5,424,030 francs auggested by the Director. The figure now included is that which was actually spent on the staff at Geneva during 1922, and it has been inserted provisionally on the understanding that the possibility of effecting an even greater economy on. this item will be considered by the Office and submitted for the consideration of tho Governing Body at its next Session.     The Budget adopted by the Governing Body differs only from the Budget proposed by the Finance Committee in respect or tho addition of a sum of 15,000 francs to the item allowed by tho finance Committee for printing the
minutes of tho Governing Body and of a sum of 550,8000 francs by way of special provision for unforeseen oxpondi-turo and repatriation allowances. 4&apos; Date and place of next Soastor.The Governing Body dooidod that its Ninetoonth Session should open at Geneva on tho.13th Juno, 1993V    .April, 19^3.Ministry of Labour, Gcnoral Department, International Labour Division, Mon t agu Hous o, S, F. 1.
