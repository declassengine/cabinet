MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE ANDI circulate a draft of this Bill for the consideration of the Home Affairs Committee.It Is important that the Bill should toe introduced before the House rises for the Whitsuntide recess in order that it may be read a second time and referred to a Standing Committee as soon as possible after the recess.The Bill Is based in the main on the report of Sir Theodore Chambers1 committee (CP,31(23) and Cd.1310) and it has been the subject of discussion with the Treasury.   I under-stand that the only point of substance to which the Treasury take objection is the provision in clause 1(5) under which advanoeis to an approved association for loans to farmers who bought their holdings during the operation of the Corn Production Aots will be made at the minimum rate allowed for the time being for loans out of the Local Loans Fund.The minimum fcate at present is 4f per cent., but the Treasury are of opinion that not less than 5 per cent, should be charged for the advances in question.Strong representations have been made to me by the agricultural members in the House of Commons that the most favourable terms possible should be granted in view of the special claim of the men who bought their farms in reliance on the continuance of the policy of the Corn Production Acts and I would urge therefore that the Home Affairs Committee should sanction the retention of clause 1(5) in the Bill,R.
