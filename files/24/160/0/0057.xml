ikis dooumem is the property of his britafnic majesty&apos;s goverhmeht.cabinet. ][ 3 &apos;;Nineteenth Session of the Governing Body of the International      n % m Labour Offioe, 12th June, 199a. 6lliMemorandum by the Minister of Labour. El, Mr. Betterton, Parliamentary Secretary to the,($).       Ministry of Labour, will attend the meeting of theGoverning Body of tho International Labour Office at Geneva on the 13th June, 1923, and the meeting of the Finance Committee of that Body on the 8th June.     A copy of tho----    Agenda of tho Session is attached.Mr. Betterton will be given the following instructions with regard to the Agenda, unleSB objection is raised. The questions were all. discussed at a meeting of the i International Labour Committee on the 30th May, and the Instructions which it is proposed to give Mr. Betterton have been framed in the lieht of the recommendations of that Committee and of the views of the various Departments concerned.INSTRUCTIONS.Item It Approval of the Minutes of the Eighteenth Session.No question arises. Item 2; Report of the Director,The only item of importance arising out of the Report of the Director is the request which has been mads by the Sub-Committee on Deok Cargoes of the Joint Maritime Commission for the institution of a spoolal Committee on Deck Cargoes under the oontrol of the International Labour Office to discuss and make proposals to the Joint Maritime Commission concerning any future amendmento to the international regulations which might appear desirable.The Board of Trade feel that, while this question is not outside the province of the International Labour Organisation,
it is one which, in the first place, can most, usefully be considered by the countries directly interested discussing the matter among themselves,   iioreover, the Board of Trade hive not yet finished giving consideration to the reports on this, matter prepared by an Advisory Committee appointed by the International Conference of Shipowners and they consequently find difficulty in taking part in an international discussion which would probably lead to a demand for the amendment of Home legislation.Mr. Betterton will explain this attitude and press that the appointment of the proposed Committee should be, at any rate, deferred.Item 31   Budget for 19S4:A separate paper is bejtig circulated to the Cabinetregarding the financial questions to be raised.Item 4;     Examination of tho proposals of tho Jury for thecompetition with regard to tne construction of&quot;the new&quot;puiiding of tHe internatioiiaI&quot;haF6ur- OfT&quot;ioeiMr. Betterton will endeavour to get the Building Sub-Committee ao re-organised as to ensure more effective oontrol over the placing of contracts and the spending of money on the proposed new building.   He proposes to raise the question whether, now that the staff of the Office is to be reduced in accordance with the decision to carry Out the work more economically, it might not be possible for plans to be adopted providing for the erection of a cheaper building, with less accommodation. Item5:     Meeting of the Mixed Advisory Committee on Agrioulture:It is proposed that the first meeting of this Committee should take place on the 9th July and the Office has suggested that certain experts should be invited to attend in order to assist the Committee.in accordance with the advioe of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Scottish Office, Mr. Betterton will oppose
the proposal to incur additional expense by Inviting these experts to attend the meeting, on the ground that their attendance is unnecessary in the light of the nature of the Agenda, end that their presence would be equivalent in fact merely to the enlarging of the size of the Committee.     He will also endeavour to get the Governing Body to lay down more definitely the purposes for which the Committee is called together and the lines on which the subjects mentioned in the Agenda should be discussed. It em 6: Meeting of the Conference of Labour Btatist iclans;It is proposed that a Conference of labour Statis-tlcians should be convened on the 29th October and that the Ag9nc3a should consist of the following items -(a) Classification of Industries and occupations for the purpose of labour statistics;(b) statistics of wages and hours of labour;(c) statistics of industrial accidents,This agenda is not regarded as entirely satisfactory, in so far as it excludes two important items definitely related to the first two items suggested, namely -(d) statistics of cost of living and retail prices;(e) statistics on employment and unemployment. Moreover, there is some danger that If, as is proposed, all Members of the International Labour Organisation are invited to send a representative to this conference,the conference will become unwieldy and, to Borne extent, badly composed for the purposes in view.There are difficulties, however, in urging the addition of subjects to the Agenda at a time when the Government is pressing for a compression of the Activities of the Offioe, while any attempt to decrease the number of Governments invited to send representatives might prejudice the arrangement which was made at the last
mooting ol the Governing Body to the effect that if all Members wore invited to send representatives their expenses should be paid by the respective Governments. It is a Standing Order that all questions involving expenditure as a result of appointment of new Commissions   or otherwise shall come before the Finance Committee before they are adopted by the Governing Body or tho Conference.Mr. Bettortoa will bear these circumstances in mind and use discretion accordingly.Item 7: proposals for a subvontion^to the Tochnlcal and BcTontiflc injTlTute &apos;&apos;bT&quot;Pro&apos;a&quot;t&apos;ha&quot;sIsf&quot;The late Cabinet have already agreed (C.P.18o/ 3) that theproposal to grant a subsidy to this Institute should be opposed, in view of tho present financial difficulties.Item 8: Meeting^ of the Advisory Committee or^ Industrial Kygiolie:&quot;I am in communication with the Home Secretary with regard to this matter, with which it will probably be un-necessary to trouble other members of the Cabinet. Item 9: Date and place of ^the next Session:No question arises.(inifd) M.B.Ministry of labour. June 1st. 1923.
