Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I ciroulate, for the information of my colleagues, a note on prospects in the different trades as given to me, in confidence, by the representatives of the trades at the last meeting of the Board of Trade Advisory-Council.(Intld.)   P.E1.-G.Board of Trade,26th April, 1923.
BOARD OF TRAPS ADVISORY COUNCIL. -        o r)i u ^Trade Outlook.   The President Invited the Members of, the Council present to express their views with regard to the trade position now and in the near future.Sir Qlynn West (Chairman of Armstrong -?hiiworth and Company! said that his remarks made at the February meeting in regard to Ship-building had been confirmed, and that steady improvement in that industry was taking place; he had hopes that this might become rapid.   He did not anticipate that any serious cheek would result from the rise in steel prices, since buyers would come to realise that no material reduction was possible.The motor Industry was doing better than had been expected:   there was also a slight Improvement in machine tools, though no big orders were being placed.   He looked for a general Improvement in engineering.   There was considerable aotivity in commercial steel and rails, though there was difficulty In getting a sufficient supply of coke, and coal for coking.   Steel works in general, though not working by any means up to their full capacity, were as fully employed as they could be In view of the shortage of coke.   A good many enquiries were being received from abroad; his firm had had to refuse a few for early delivery, but could take orders for future delivery.   There was a fair demand from Spain, and also to some extent from India, but that from Chiria and Japan was small.   He agreed that the present activity might perhaps be more or less temporary, and due to events in the Ruhr.Mr. Holroyd (Cotton: Director of R. &amp; J. Holroyd, Halifax; federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Association and Federation of British Industries) said, speaking principally for the spinning end of the cotton industry, that the situation was not much better than a month ago.   Prices, however, were better on the whole.   The American section had only been working half time.   Sellers would not sell below the cost of production, and buyers on the Manchester Exchange were waiting to see if sellers would have to reduce their prices, with the consequence that little business was being done.   The demand from China and the East was poor.   Business in the fine counts was, however, good; the Egyptian section of the trade was more than making ends meet.   He could not see any prospect of a reduction in the price of the raw material on account of the shortage of American cotton.Mr. Murray (Commerce: Messrs. Ker Bolton &amp; Company, Glasgow, East Indian Merchants) said that the Far Eastern markets were slowly improvingj various markets, such as that for Manchester textiles, which had been holding off for lower prices, were now buying, though not rapidly; thus Java, Singapore, Siam and the Philippines, were all now buying textiles where they had not been buying a month ago.   There was also a distinct improvement in hardware; stocks had been exhausted and were being replaced at higher prices than those ruling a month ago.   The position was in general quite healthy, and we remained able to compete with Japan and &quot;the United States, on account of the prices demanded by those countries.   The policy of restricting rubber output had helped the Malay States, and a good price was also being obtained for sugar.   He was fairly optimistic as to prospects in general.
Mr. Murray also received the following telegram, but not in time to read it at the Council:-&quot;Glasgow 12/27.&quot;&quot;Steel Works west of Scotland while not on full capacity &quot;are fairly well employed on work placed at the end of &quot;last year and beginning of this year on orders for home &quot;market.   Owing to occupation of Ruhr considerable numbers &quot;of orders have been placed.   Owing, however, to high &quot;prices, and scarcity of coal and pig iron Blast Furnaces &quot;owners have not lit up additional furnaces:   cost of &quot;steel has had to be advanced:   no new orders are being &quot;consequently booked and outlook very uncertain.&quot;Mr . Tait (Non-Ferrous Metals:    Chairman of British Aluminium Company, Limited, and Director of British Metal Corporation, Limited) said that the non-ferrous metal trade had shown signs of improvement especially during the last three months.   The price of spelter had advanced, and the demand was good.   During the last month there had also been enquiries from Germany, especially for aluminium, which we had not sold there since the armistice;   a number of enquiries were coming also from the United States.   The outlook at present was good.Mr. Evan Williams (President, Mining Association of Great Britain) said that there was a strong demand for coal for export - in fact, in excess of the supply;    large quantities were being shipped to France and Italy, but nevertheless those markets were not getting as much as they needed.     The French importers seemed to have been under the impression that as soon as they got a firm hold in the Ruhr they would have no need, for British coal, but they had found out that this was erroneous. There was also a steady demand for British coal from South America.   Germany was not taking quite as much as formerly, but there was still a certain demand from the United States, though the latter country was at the same time exporting coal to Europe.   The British internal demand was good;    there was Indeed a considerable deficiency of coke and coal, especially in South Wales, so much so as to constitute a serious problem for the blast furnaces.   Contracts were being made up to the end of the year, though not for large quantities;   the French railways were buying up to the end of the year at good prices.Some difficulty was being experienced in South Wales in getting coal shipped;   there was a certain amount of congestion at the docks, and the dockers there declined to work three shifts-.   More coal could not be shipped unless there was either an increase in dock accommodation, which would take three years or more to provide, or more than the two shifts were worked. On the North-East coast a third shift was being worked so far as necessary, one-third extra wages being paid for the third shift.   South Wales shipowners, however, refused to pay more for the third shift;   in the pre-war period all three shifts had been paid for at the same rate.   The South Wales shipowners maintained that it would not pay them to pay extra for the third shift.The output of the coal industry was good and for several weeks now had nearly been up to the 1913 figure, though a number of non-union strikes in South Wales had reduced the output.   A certain number of such local disputes (not with the owners, but due to rivalries between the various unions) were still taking place in South Wales.The President enquired how far efforts were being made to keep down the home price of coke and to conserve home supplies.-2-
Mr. Williams replied that endeavours were being made&quot; in this direction with some success; the price of coke for home consumption had not gone up so much as for export.The British railways had not yet discussed their June contracts.Mr. Sanderson (Sanderson, Murray and Elder, Limited, Australasian Merchants, representing Australia on the Advisory Council) said that conditions in Australia continued good: the price of wool was firm, and the main oause for anxiety was the drought in Queensland and New South Wales; it was also somewhat late in the season to expeot good rains.   The situation was other-wise favourable, and balances were being accumulated.Sir A. Shirley Benn, M.P., (President, Association of British Chambers of Commerce&quot;) remarked that members of the Chambers of Commerce were generally of opinion that the trade situation was fairly good; improvement was slow but continuous.Colonel Armstrong; (Past President of the Council of the Federation of British Industries: Chairman of Greenwood and B;atley Limited, Engineers, Leeds) said that the general engineering industry showed no improvement, except in the textile machinery branch, which was full up with orders, and in shipbuilding; in the machine tool trade and other branches orders were not coming forward.   He thought the reason was that manufacturers were not increasing their plant, having enough for their present market.Sir Edwin Stockton, HP.  (Abbot and Stockton, cloth merchants, Bradford: President, Manchester Chamber of Commerce) said that the manufacturing side of the cotton industry was doing better: more machinery was working, and some districts were occupied practically up to their full capacity.   A struggle as to prices was going on between the buyer and the seller; sellers were having to look for buyers, and the buyers were aware of the facto   The finishing trades such as dyeing and bleaching were doing well, The packing trade was,a good index, and it had come to his notice that a big packing concern in Manchester was now doing a normal trade; this seemed to imply that conditions in the industry in general were not so bad as was sometimes reported.   Stocks in Manchester were lower, so far at any rate as finished goods were concerned, though he was not quite sure if the same was true of yarns.   High prices alone were preventing quite a good trade from being done.   Short time woi&quot;king was no doubt necessary, but was unfortunate, on account of its effect in raising prices and post-postponing revival in the industry.   It was perhaps true that If full time were being worked, some rise in the price of raw cotton might result, but those manufacturers who were working full time could take up on better terms any business that might be offering on account of their proportionately lower overhead costs.   He agreed that if trade were going as it should,, there would be a shortage of raw cotton.   He thought the general tendency in the industry was towards an improvement.Speaking from the railway standpoint  (as a director of the London, Midland and Scottish group; he noted that general traffic returns were better.   He mentioned that his group were sympathetic towards the movement for a reduction of rates, though it was no doubt possible that other groups were not so favourably situated as themselves for effecting reductions.Mr * Williams   said that it was the Coal Trade&apos;s complaint EnaT&quot;&quot;tfTe reductions made in the railway rates for coal were governed by the situation obtaining in the least favourably situated railway groups.     The big coal-carrying lines could afford to give a reduction, but at
The total exportation this year as shown in these figures was, he observed, more than double that of last year, and he thought that a serious effect on textiles was being produood as a result (l) of the increased price&apos;of ooal, and (2) of the shortage of supply.The second point to which he wished to draw attention was the effect of the depreciation of the franc in &apos; flooding British markets with French woollen goods - worsteds principally, not woollenB.     The French cloth was a single-warp cloth heavily filled, which had the appearance of a better quality than it really possessed.-a-but at present, lie thought, a uniform rates arrangement was being followed, and consequently the position of the other groups did not permit of a reduction.   He did not think, however, that there was anything in the rules of the Railway Rates Tribunal which required this uniformity to be maintained5   if it were insisted upon, the Ooal trade would have to take their caBe for a reduction to the Tribunal, though thoy were at present negotiating with the four General Managers.In reply to a suggestion by the President that an application to the Tribunal and negotiations with the railway oompanies might be conducted simultaneously, Mr. Williams expressed some doubt whetlier the Tribunal, who wore still occupied with fixing standard rates and classifications, were yet in a position to consider individual applications for reductions of rates.Mr. Huroomb (Ministry of Transport) said that the Tribunal was now far advanood with the preparation of the olasslfioation and mileage rates which, under the Railways Aot 1921, are to take effect as from the appointed day. The situation was at present governed by the transitory provisions of the Railways Aot.     These provisions gave the Railway Companies the power to charge the rates which they were charging by the direction of the Minister of Transport at the cessation of control, but at the same time it gave a right of appeal to the Tribunal against those rates, either by way of a general reduotion or of particular reductions affecting individual commodities;   the Railway Oompanies might also apply to tho Tribunal for an increase of rates.     The Tribunal was given power to hear such applications and to fix the day when any new rates fixed by them accordingly should come into- force.     In other words, such reductions could be granted by the Tribunal forthwith, and they would continue in foroe till the appointed day.Mr. Sutoliffe Smith (Textiles:   Bradford Dyers&apos; Association) called attention to the incidence of the coal supply upon the textile industries, and gave comparative figures showing the quantities of coal shipped from the Humber Ports during March -1922 and March 1923, as follows:-35th March, 24th&apos;March, 1922. 1923.Tons. Tons.From Immingham.........    82,975 201,020&quot;   Grimsby ...........   84,206 117,872&quot;   Hull..............    94,726 269,871Total .... 261,907 588,763
Sir William Pearoe (Chemicals: Association of British Chemical Mahufao^re&apos;rs&apos;7 Director of Spencer Chapman and. Messell, Limited, and Member of the Council of the Federation of British Industries) mentioned that it was reported that the French Government were devoting large sums to encourage the export of cotton goods to Central Europe and Czecho-Slovakia.The President remarked that at the last meeting Col. Willey had expressed the view that the volume of French exports in textiles was not at present sufficient seriously to reduce our own exports of textile goods but that a disturbing effect was produced by the offering of the French goods at low prices.Mr. Sutoliffe Smith thought that there was a considerable volume of French goods now coming into this oountryj    there had recently been an increase In tho importation of worsteds to a greater extent than was apparent from the Trade Returns.     He mentioned that under the new Franco-Canadian Agreement of December last the French were granted a reduction of 15$ on the 35$ tariff, with the consequence that where British goods had to pay a duty, of  27.10.0 per  100 value., French goods paid  29.15.0;   in other words, the preference to Great Britain,only amounted to 2^$.     The effect of the depreciation of the franc was to make the        preference which we enjoy negligible:   and there was a prospect of our being seriously prejudiced both in the Canadian and also the London market.     The Frenoh wero following the example set by the Germans in similar oiroumstanoes of quoting prices which just under-cut tho British price, and he had information from Roubaix that they oould afford to sell for considerably less, and this in spite of the fact that the Roubaix workers were being well paid.Sir William Pearoo&apos;said he understood that the French Government Were(giving substantial encouragement both to their cotton and woollen textile industries.Proceeding, Hr. Sutoliffe Smith said that there had been some clearance of stocks in the East, but not many encouraging cables were being received.     The situation, however, would probably be better about. July, when the cotton crop prospects beoame known.     Eastern markets complained that our. prices were too high.Mr. Lindsay (Indian Trade Commissioner, for the India Office) said that India had inoreasod her takings of cotton goods during last year;   excepting in Bombay, stocks in the country were generally low.     Buying was now taking place on a scale corresponding to consumption, and stocks were   not being accumulated.India&apos;s capacity to export was now in the neighbour-hood of  20,000,000 per month against  13,000,000 a year ago;   imports wore also down from  17,000,000 to  13,000,000 per month, over the year.     Unfortunately the balance appeared to be going mainly into bullion, of which India had taken  2,000,000 worth in December;   this had increased to  4,000,000 in February and was now at the
rate of some  6,000,000 ner month.     It appeared, therefore,, that cultivators were not, buying textiles, but bullion instead, the proportion of gold being about double that of silver.     India had for some time been almost the sole supporter of the gold market.Sir William Pearoe said that the chemical industry was now to some extent marking time, and manufacturers wero asking themselves if the improvement which had taken place since the war was now checked.     The statistics of sulphuric acid consumption oontinued bad, not amounting to more than 75^ of the pre-war consumption.     The effect       j upon the British chemical industry of the disturbance in Germany had not made itself felt, on account of the heavy stocks held here;   there was no shortage of dyos or fine chomioals in this country in spite of the falling off in German supplies.     He oould not observo any improvement      m in the industry since last month. mr.. Moore (West African Merchant) said that the JKimprovement &quot;in the produce trade had been maintained, but       p had not progrossed further,&apos;   there was a oertain amount of hesitation on the part of West African buyers.Sir Robert Glanfield (Chairman of George Glanfield and Sons,&apos; Limited, London, Wholesale Clothing Manufacturers)   . said that the wholesale clothing trade had not yet reached Its pre-war bulk, although it was higher in value.   The trade was doing better this year than last year, though the export trade was bad.     Few workers were available, numbers having dropped out, and no new ones were being trained. He thought that the Ministry of Labour returns would show that there were not many hands seeking employment;   firms requiring workers would have to train them themselves. There was not much short time in the trade.     Prices were perhaps slightly hardening.     The delivery of certain materials, such as the coarser yarns, was remarkably quick (only some two or three weeks)j   for fine goods, however, the period was about 3 months.   There were many failures at present in the trade, and prioes generally were not good. Tho demand was more for low-priced than for expensive goods, and there was a tendency not to buy expensive ready-mades.      jS He considered that prices next year would have to be reduced, H and the use of poorer materials would be the consequence.       j The export trade, especially to South Africa, had greatly       I fallen off as compared with the boom years, during which there had been over-importationj   the stocks then imported     II were still far from being cleared;   there was little sign       ! of any improvement in the export trade as yet.ex&quot;Mr. Baring (Bankingi Director of Baring Brothers and [ 0ompanyT noted no striking change in the financial situation, ! Bank balances continued to contract, but a surplus was &apos;&quot;w&quot;&apos;disclosed in the Exchequer balance.     Sterling had fallen in relation to the dollar.     He thought that the United States were buying rubber and oertain oils freely here. Higher rates for money were now being obtained in New York than previously, and oertain Amerioan holders were realising  H their foreign securities.     At home money was abundant, disaount rates wore low, and new issues were readily taken -   .Is
COKPTDENTIAL.Sir James Allen (High Commissioner for New Zealand) said that the purchasing power of New Zealand had increased considerably and was likely to continue to-do so.   As regards the point raised by Sir Robert Glanfield as to over-lmporta-tion into countries abroad two years ago, he considered that in New Zealand these stocks had now been   cleared, and that merchants and traders were only buying what they actually needed. &apos; Referring to his remarks at the February meeting as to the possibility of entering into some financial arrange-ments to secure a supply of cheap money for New Zealand for development purposes, Sir Jame3 Allen said that he under-stood that negotiations on this subject were now in progress.The President said that he hoped to raise this matter at the Imperial Economic Conference.Referring to the Merchandise Marks Bill which had been introduced by the Agricultural group in the House of Commons, Sir James Allen said it was important to all the   Dominions that there should he some better system of marking, their produce.     &quot;Imported&quot; was the mark prescribed in the Bill, but he thought that, for example, New Zealand produce should be marked as such.     Certain cases had come to light lately in which Imported meat and butter not of New Zealand origin was being sold in the United Kingdom as New Zealand produce. He submitted that foreign produce should be marked &quot;foreign&quot;, while If some such designation as &quot;Imported - Empire&quot; were prescribed for Empire produce the actual country of origin should also be given.The   President said that this might present some difficulty;   he enquired how far the situation could be met by arrangements made in New Zealand?Sir James Allen said that arrangements could be made by his Government to apply to wholesalers in the Dominions but not to retailers in this country.     The President asked whether the necessary arrangements could not be entered Into with the retailers in contracts, thus avoiding legislation?     Mr. Sanderson said that the Australian Delegation now In this country were discussing the point; they were also considering whether improved arrangements could be made for the advertising of Australasian products in this country.The President observed that marking of a very detailed character would be difficult to enforce.Sir James Allen suggested that some improvement appeared to be called for as regards prosecutions;   he had recently had a clear case, In which, however, he had been legally advised that the evidence was not strong enough. He was communicating with the Ministry of Agriculture in regard to the Agricultural Merchandise Marks Bill now before Parliament.Another point to which he desired to call attention related to the facilities for New Zealand shipments in the Port of London.   The Port of London Authority had erected a cold store for frozen meat in the Albert Docks;   the
C OK F IDE&apos;.MT IA L.Argentine had a shed next to the wharf used by the Hew Zealand Shipping Companies, and a proposal was now afoot that the Argentine should also, secure another shed on the opposite side of the sorting shed.     He had been told that the original arrangement was that the whole of that Dock should be reserved for Dominion frozen meat;   if the present proposal were allowed, the consequences for the Dominions would be serious.It was remarked that the Port of London Authority were a self-governing body and themselves allotted their space, but Mr;. Hurcomb (Ministry of Transport) undertook to have the matter looked into.In addition, a letter had been received from Mr .Watson containing the following remarks in regard to the trade outlook:-&quot;So far as the London Midland and Scottish Railway is concerned, taking the 15 weeks ended 1st April, 1923, a3 compared with the corresponding period of 1922, the following position is shown:-GOODS TRAIN TONNAGE. % Increase over 1922.Merchandise ......... 3Coal Class.......... 442.&quot;
