Memorandum h^. the Chancellor of.the uxchequer.The memorandum circulated by the Secretary for Scotland (C.Pi 209/23) raises in a very aoute form the difficult question of the relation between grants distributed by the Govern-ment in Sngland and Scotland respectively.     Hitherto the pro-portion generally observed between the two countries has been that of 80:11 introduced by Mr. Goschen in 1888 as being the propor-tions in which they then contributed to the Exchequer, though it is now slightly more favourable to Scotland than her present contri-bution would warrant.   In certain cases, however, and particularly where a sex-vise is administered on an identical basis in both countries, the distribution has simply followed the needs of the service, but the result on the whole has not been very different from the C-oschen proportion, as most of these services depend on the numbers of the population which approximate to that proportion for the two countries.   There have of course been exceptions above and below the proportion, but taking the Government grants as a whole, the Goschen proportion has been fairly well observed.In the present instanoe the Secretary for Scotland proposes to depart bo far from it as to give Scotland an Exchequer grant of  850,000 for relief of rates on agricultural land, this sum representing nearly one-third of the estimated corresponding English grant ( 2,750,000).     In my opinion, only the strongest possible claim on the ground of the merits of the service to which the money is to be applied could justify so generous treatment to &apos;Scotland,
Scotland, and when I find from figures BUpplied hy the Scottish Office that about  800,000 of this sum is going directly to relieve the rates on the landowners and only about  50,000 to relieve the rates of the farmers I feel bound to dissent, from, his proposals.The grants made under the old Agricultural Rates Aotifexcited strong opposition at the time - and from no one so much aB from the late Prime Minister - as being in the long run a gift to the landowners, and I think I am right in Baying that it was this oriticiem on the EngliBh Bill that made the Government of the day deoide, when they came to deal with Scotland, that they could not propose to Parliament a direct gift to the landowners in that country in the form of a halving of their rates.    The relief given was accordingly restricted to the occupiers and made on a higher soale than in England,   Thus whereas the English farmer on the average had his total rates (oniands and buildings) reduoed by 44j , the Scottish farmer had his total rates (which were already on a muoh lower level) reduced by 62$$, with the result that in 1920/21 the Scottish farmer was paying oryihe average rates of less than 2/- in the   on land and buildings, while the English, farmer was paying not far short of 5/- in the   on his land and 10/- in the   on his buildings.\7hile I have no objection to some additional relief being given to the Scottish farmers I cannot see how a grant to the landowners is going to improve the farmers&apos; position,    And in the case of the landowners who have bought their estates during the recent selling boom, it cannot even be argued that they have been bearing the&apos; recent increases of rates.     They bought their landcheaper

The Scottish farmer now pays 3/3the. of the ordinary occupier&apos;e rates on land and buildings and this will reduoe his liability to one-fifth at a cost of about  210,000 per annum, leaving about  170,000 per annum (or whatever the balance of the ll/80ths. of the actual English grant ie found to amount to) available for other purposes.
