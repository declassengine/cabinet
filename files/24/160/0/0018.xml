The Committee are informed that in the recent corres-Conference. pondence with the Dominions the terms &quot; Imperial Conference &quot;and &quot; Conference of Prime Ministers &quot;&apos; have been used, so far as possible, interchangeably. The title given to similar Imperial meetings before the war was &quot; Imperial Conference &quot; and in this Report the Committee have assumed that the Meeting will be 1 known as the &quot; Imperial Conference, 1923.&quot;
British 3. The question of British representation at the ConferenceRepresentation.       js one for the decision of the Cabinet.   The Cabinet may,however, wish to be reminded of the nature of the british representation at the last Imperial Conference, namely thatwhich met in the summer of 1921..At the Imperial Conference in 1921 the British represen-tatives were: The Prime Minister (Mr. Lloyd George). The Lord Privy Seal (Mr. Chamberlain). The Lord President of the Council (Lord Balfour). The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Lord Curzon).The Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr. Churchill).The Secretary of State for India appeared in the record of of the proceedings as head of the Indian Delegation. The Secretary of State for the Colonies attended meetings not merely in his capacity as Representative of the Colonies and Protectorates, but also by virtue of the fact that he was the Secretary of State specially entrusted with Dominion relations. The Secretary of State for the Colonies presided at those Meetings of the Committees of the Conference held at the Colonial Office.In addition to the representatives named above, the following Ministers attended meetings of the Conference and of its Committees for the discussion of subjects which particularly concerned their respective Departments : The Lord Chancellor;The Chancellor of the Exchequer;The Secretary of State for War;The First Lord of the Admiralty;The President of the Board of Trade;The President of the Board of Education;The Secretary of State for Air ; andThe Postmaster-General.Procedure at the 4. In the opinion of the Committee, it is highly desirableConference. that, if possible, the first meeting of the Imperial Conference;   \ should take place on Monday, the 1st October, 1923, the date/ named in the Prime Minister&apos;s invitations to the Dominions- and India.   At the 1921 Conference the proceedings opened witha general statement of the Imperial situation, made by the Prime Minister, after which statements were made by the various Dominion and Indian representatives. This preliminary discussion was followed by a statement made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on Foreign Policy; by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on Oversea Developments and Policy, with special reference to the Colonies, Protectorates, Mandated Territories and the Middle East, and by the Secretary of State for India on the situation in India.The Committee are informed that a few days will necessarily elapse before any economic questions considered by the Imperial Economic Conference which need discussion at the Imperial Conference can be in a form ready for submission. It is not impossible that certain Dominions may be represented at both Conferences by the same persons. The Committee also under-stand that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs may desire to postpone his statement to the Imperial Conference on Foreign &quot;Policy for some days after the opening of the Conference and that it is not certain that the Secretary of State for India will desire to make a statement.
The Committee recommend  j.18i.) That the Imperial Conference, 1923, should, if possible, be formally opened by the Prime Minister on the morning of Monday, 1st October, 1923, with a general statement on the Imperial situation to be followed by discussion, which, judging by previous precedents, may occupy a whole day.(ii.) That Tuesday and Wednesday, 2nd and 3rd October respectively, should be devoted to meetings of the Economic Conference.(iii.) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should, if possible, be prepared to make his statement on Foreign Policy at the second meeting of the Imperial Conference to be held on Thursday, 4th October, 1923.(iv.) That, following the precedent of 1921, no special memo-randa need be prepared for the general Ministerial statements.(v.) That the Prime Ministers statement need contain no detailed special reference to the situation in Ireland, beyond extending a welcome to the Irish repre-sentative.In order that the Dominion representatives may be kept informed of recent developments the Committee have requested the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office to take particular care to see that the Dominions should be supplied during the next few months with all the important papers bearing on the questions concerning foreign affairs likely to be discussed at the Conference, the India Office, in concert with the other Departments, to take such corresponding action as is necessary.5. The Committee are informed that the Secretary of State for the Colonies has suggested that Sir Maurice Hankey should be invited to act as Secretary of the Conference, with a deputy from the Colonial Office.The Committee recommend That Sir Maurice Hankey should be nominated Secretary of the Conference with Mr. E. J. Harding, C.M.G., Colonial Office, as Deputy Secretary, and that, following previous precedents, each of the Dominions and India should be invited to nominate a member of the Secretariat.The Committee have requested the Colonial Office to com-municate forthwith with the Dominions, enquiring what office accommodation, if any, the various Dominion delegations will require.Secretarial Arrangements.Documents for 6. The Committee recommend India.0mini0nS an (1.) That Departments be requested to furnish the cabinet offices, not later than Saturday, the 2nd June, 1923, with copies of Memoranda, &amp;c, which they desire should be sent to the Dominion and Indian Govern-ments for consideration at the Conference. (2.) That before any document mentioned in (1) above is transmitted to the Dominion and Indian Governments, it should be approved by a Standing Committee of Ministers.
The Committee are informed that in the case of documents prepared for the Economic Conference, it is in contemplation that, a Ministerial Committee, which should include The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for India,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The President of the Board of Trade,should sanction transmission.The Committee suggest that the same Committee, with the addition of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the First Lord of the Admiralty, should be requested to authorise the transmission of papers pre-pared for the Imperial Conference, the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for Air being invited to attend any discussions affecting the War Office and Air Ministry.7. Mr. Mackenzie King, who became Prime Minister of Canada at the end of 1921, raised in 1922 the question of publication of several of the Confidential documents prepared for the 1921 Conference. Mr. Lloyd George most strongly deprecated this proposal, and his view was supported by the Prime Ministers of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa. It is possible that Mr. Mackenzie King, who is being constantly pressed in the Canadian Parliament for the presentation of papers on matters affecting the international relations of Canada, may raise the question again, and urge that the greater part of the proceedings at the Conference should be published.The Committee do not underrate the importance of the widest publicity to the proceedings of the Conference, consistent with entire freedom of discussion, and they presume that, as on previous occasions, the Imperial Conference, 1923, will authorise the publication, either in full or in the form of a summary, of a considerable part of its proceedings, including the opening statements and some of the more general discussions. In connection with certain questions, however, such as Foreign Policy and the details of Defence, the Committee suggest that it should be made clear at the outset that the discussions must be regarded as confidential, and that only such Conclusions and documents should be published as may be approved by the Conference as a whole.Possibly it might become necessary, if there is any strong opinion in the contrary sense, to arrange for certain questions of a specially confidential character to be remitted for consideration to some such body as the Committee of Imperial Defence.&apos; But the Committee do not think it would be advisable to make any suggestion to this effect at this stage.The Committee recommend (i.) That the Colonial Office and the India Office respec-tively be authorised to communicate as soon as possible with the Dominion and Indian Governments, suggesting that, while the importance of the fullest publicity consistent with entire freedom of discussion is recognised, it is proposed that the precedent of the 1921 Conference should be followed, that is to say, in the case of questions such as foreign policy or the details of Imperial Defence, where secrecy is essential to complete freedom of discussion, the results only should be published, the discussions themselves being kept secret.
Subjects to be proposed to the Governments of the Dominions and India for inclusion in the Agenda for the forthcoming Meeting of the Imperial Conference :Imperial Defence Questions:(a.) NavalQuestions.(b.) MilitaryQuestions.(c.) AirQuestions.(d.) Attendance of Experts.(ii.) That the same communication should indicate, that 1 1 0 documents forwarded to the Dominion and Indian  Governments in advance of the Conference should be regarded as strictly confidential.8. Apart from the question of foreign policy, the subjects proposed for discussion at the Conference fall into the following categories: (1.) Imperial Defence Questions.(2.) League of Nations Questions.(3.) Imperial Air and Wireless CommunicationsQuestions. (4.) Economic Questions. (5.) Miscellaneous Questions.9. The subject of Imperial Defence was raised at the 1921 Conference by Lord Balfour, then Chairman of the Standing Defence Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. The Committee assume that at the forthcoming Imperial Conference the discussion will be initiated either by the Prime Minister or Lord Salisbury, the present Chairman of the Standing Defence Sub-Committee.The Committee understand that there is some prospect of the Report of the Special Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, which is enquiring into the question of National and Imperial Defence, being ready for communication to the Dominions prior to the opening of the Conference.The Committee presume that naval questions will be introduced by statements by the First Lord and the First Sea Lord.They recommend That the Admiralty be requested to prepare further Memoranda (in addition to C.I.D. 176-C) for the con-sideration of the Standing Defence Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, the Memoranda in question being drafted on the assumption that they will be ultimately communicated to the Dominion and Indian Governments.The Committee understand that, pending the report of the Special Sub-Committee referred to above, the Secretary of State for War is not prepared to say whether he will have any special military questions to raise at the Conference or not.The Committee are informed that the Secretary of State for Air has suggested the following as the main question for discussion at the Conference : Co-operation with the Dominions in Air Defence.Discussion of the main question would raise the following points: (a.) Standardisation of materiel.(b.i Uniformity of organisation, training and equipment.(c.) Supply and exchange of personnel.(-d.) Mobilisation and provision of trained reserves.At the same time the attitude of the Air Ministry would largely depend on the nature of the report of the Special Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence mentioned above. ;       .In connection with the general question of Imperial Defence, the Committee have considered whether His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should take the initiative in suggesting that the Dominion
and Indian representatives should be accompanied by their expert advisers. The Admiralty and Air Ministry are in favour of such a suggestion being made, the War Office, on the other hand, think that the necessity for the presence of military experts must depend on the scope of the Conference in respect of defence questions. If the general policy could be sufficiently defined by October next so that proposals could then be ready for the consideration of the Dominion and Indian military experts, the War Office think that the latter should be present. The Committee recommend That as the subjects for discussion under the heading Imperial Defence will be predominantly naval and air, a suggestion should be made to the Dominion and Indian Governments that naval and air experts should accom-pany the representatives.Military questions, on the other hand, seem likely to be questions of principle rather than of detail, and in these circumstances the Committee hesitate to suggest that. military experts should be invited to attend the Conference.The last conclusion is provisional and subject to the views of the Secretary of State for War.It is assumed that in any case the Dominion and Indian representatives will be accompanied by economic experts as was suggested in the Prime Ministers original message of the 29th November, 1922.&apos;League of Nations Questions:Treaty of Mutual Guarantee and United States of America and &quot;C&quot; Mandates.10. The Committee recommend (i.) That the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee should be entered on the agenda of the Conference, although the necessity for discussion will depend on what happens at the meeting of the Assembly of the League in September.(ii.) That the question of the attitude of the United States of America towards &quot; C &quot; mandates should be entered on the agenda, as a subject suggested for discussion by New Zealand. *In this connection the Committee understand that India desires to bring up a subject which her representatives have raised at previous meetings of the Assembly of the League of Nations, viz., the admission of Indians into &quot; C &quot; mandated territories.Allocation of British Empire share of League of Nations Expenses.The Committee understand that it is possible that the question of the allocation of the British Empire share of the League of Nations expenses for 1923 will be settled before the meeting of the Conference. If this hope is not realised an opportunity might be taken to discuss this matter informally with the Dominion and Indian representatives.Imperial Air and Wirelesc Communications:Imperial Air (Jommuuica-tions.&apos; 11. The commercial aspect of the question of Imperial Air Communications will be under consideration at the Economic Conference. The question of airships as an element of Imperial Air Communications is at present. under consideration by the Committee of Imperial Defence, mainly from the defence point* The Committee have requested the Colonial Office, in. consultation with the Foreign Office, to prepare a Memorandum for the information of the British repre-sentatives on the question of the attitude of the United States, of America towards &quot;C&quot; Mandates. ,  -   -

The Committee do not know what the result of that consideration may be, and in the circumstances it may be necessary to defer for later examination. the question whether the subject of Imperial Air Communications (Airships1 should be placed on the Agenda of the Conference.

The Committee are of opinion that it would be undesirableQuestions. at the present time to particularise those economic questionswhich may come eventually before the Imperial Conference. The Committee recommend That the Agenda for the Imperial Conference should contain a statement to the effect that it is probable that some of the economic questions considered by the Economic Conference will raise matters of principle requiring discussion at the Imperial Conference.Miscellaneous 13. (1.) The Committee recommend that the following questions. action   should   be   taken   as   regards   the   undermentionedmiscellaneous questions to which their attention has been directed: (i.) That the question of a common Imperial policy respecting territorial waters, which is under con-sideration by an Interdepartmental Committee, should be placed on the Agenda of the Conference.(ii.) That the question of united action against the spread of Communist propaganda should be placed on the Agenda as a question suggested by the Indian Government.(iii.) (a.) That the question of the Treaty-signing powers of the Dominions and India should be left to the Dominion and Indian representatives to raise if they think fit.(6.) That the Foreign Office should be requested to prepare, in consultation with the Colonial Office and India Office, a Memorandum on this subject for the information of the British representatives in case it should be needed. ,(iv.) That the question of marriages with foreigners should be entered on the Agenda as a subject for discussion suggested by Australia. -    &apos;(2.) The Committee are informed that it may be necessary to make a statement to the Conference on the position respecting the nationality of married women, and to explain that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not propose to make any alteration to the Nationality Law except after consultation with the \ Governments of the Dominions and India.. ., ...&apos;.:,-&quot;(3.) The Committee understand that ,the. Government of India have suggested that the question of giving early notifica-tion to India of laws passed in other; parts of the Empire affecting Indians should be . raised at the Conference. The Committee suggest that this matter could best be dealt with by means of informal communications between the Dominion and Indian representatives.
Relation of the Imperial Con-ferenoe and the Economic, Conference.Draft Telegrams to the Dominions.(4.) The Committee also understand that the Indian Govern-ment may wish to discuss the question of Dominion contribution towards the maintenance of Aden as a fuelling station. The Committee think that the best opportunity for such a discussion would arise in connection with the general question of Imperial Defence.14. The Committee have considered the question of the relations between the Imperial Conference and the Economic Conference. The alternatives are that the Economic Conference should refer all its conclusions to the Imperial Conference for confirmation, or that on the analogy of the Imperial War Conference in relation to the Imperial War Cabinet in 1917-18&apos; the Economic Conference should be in a position to pass its own resolutions on purely economic questions.The Committee recommend (1.) That the Economic Conference should, so far as possible, be treated as a separate entity with its own Secre-tarial arrangements and that on purely economic questions the Economic Conference should be in a position to pass its own resolutions without bringing them before the Imperial Conference, unless some delegation desired this course.(2.) That it should be open to the Imperial Conference to remit for examination by the Economic Conference suitable questions such as, for example, the economic aspect of the question of Territorial Waters.15. The Committee have incorporated in the draft telegrams attached (see Appendix) those recommendations contained in the above report, which it is thought should be communicated to the Dominions and India with as little delay as possible.The Committee recommend That the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary of State for India be authorised to despatch telegrams to the Dominion and Indian Governments respectively, on the lines of the drafts contained in the Appendix.(Signed on behalf of the Committee)M.

APPENDIX.Imperial Conference, 1923. Draft Telegrams to the Dominions.&apos;   ^ (A.)    &apos;(Condsnbial.) , May,My telegram of 7th April.Following for your Prime Minister from Prime Minister.  Begins :-&quot;Paragraph 1. We have now further considered question of Agenda for Imperial Conference, We suggest that, as in 1921, opening meeting should include statements as to general position on main issues of Imperial policy.&quot; Paragraph 2. These preliminary statements might be followed by (1) review of foreign affairs since 1921 Conference and consideration of present problems and future policy ; (2) discussions on Naval, Military and Air Defence.&quot; Paragraph 3. Former heading would also cover: &quot; (a.) Any questions connected with the League of Nations, including Treaty of Mutual Guarantee and attitude of United States to &quot; C &quot; Mandates which has been suggested by New Zealand; we understand that India desires to bring up in this connection subject which has been raised by Indian representatives at previous meetings of Assembly of League, viz., admission of Indians into &quot; C &quot; Mandated Territories.&quot; (b.) Question of common Imperial policy regarding territorial waters, which we are anxious to have discussed.&quot; (c.) Question of united action against spread of communist propaganda which India wishes to raise.&quot; Paragraph 4. Heading (2) would comprise review of naval situation resulting from Washington Conference and arrangements for future co-operation in all branches of defence.&quot; Paragraph 5. Among subjects which will also require attention on part of Imperial Conference at some stage of proceedings, on questions of principle referred from Imperial Economic Conference, will be Imperial air and wireless communications, and probably certain economic questions of special importance.&quot; Paragraph 6. Lastly, Australia recently suggested for discussion at an Imperial Conference question of marriages with foreigners, and we may wish to bring up question of nationality of married women.&quot; Paragraph 7. Should be glad to know as soon as possible whether you are in agreement with agenda outlined above, and whether you have any further subjects to add.&quot; Paragraph 8. We should also like to make it clear in advance that Cabinet here, while recognising the importance of the fullest publicity consistent with entire freedom of discussion, are strongly of opinion that the precedent of 1921 Conference should be followed, that is to say, that in case of questions such as foreign policy or the details of Imperial Defence where secrecy is essential to complete freedom of discussion, the results only of deliberations should be published, discussions themselves being kept secret. Similarly, we trust that any documents forwarded to you in advance of the Conference will be regarded as strictly confidential.&quot; Paragraph 9. Similar telegram being sent to other Prime Ministers and to India, and question of publication of any part of agenda for Conference must, I think, stand over till, replies complete. I assume, however, that there will be general desire to announce outline of programme, and this telegram has been framed accordingly, though I should not contemplate publication of paragraphs 3 and 8.&quot; Paragraph 10. I am telegraphing separately as to attendance of expert advisers and secretarial arrangements.&quot;   Ends.
(B.), May   ,Following for your Prime Minister from Prime Minister.   Begins :  &quot; My telegram of to-day: Imperial Conference.&quot; We are assuming that, as suggested in my telegram of 29th November, representatives at Economic Conference will be accompanied by expert advisers, and we think that it might be desirable for naval and air experts to accompany representatives at Imperial Conference, since subjects for discussion under heading of defence seem likely at present to be predominantly naval and air.&quot; We hope that Hankey will be available to act as Secretary of Imperial Conference, and that, in accordance with 1921 arrangements, Dominions and India will also nominate members of Secretariat. It would greatly facilitate our arrangements if we could hear as soon as possible what office accommodation in London, if any, apart from hotel accommodation, is likely to be required by Dominion delegations. Owing to reductions in staff of Cabinet Secretariat we regret that it will not be possible to supply any clerical assistance to Delegations apart from the clerical requirements of the Conference itself.&quot; Similar telegram sent to other Prime Ministers and India.&quot;  Ends.
