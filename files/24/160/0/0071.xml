(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAINIC V;AJE3TY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT. )SECRET.cabinet .CP. 272(231-fLEAGUE OF NATIONS ASSEMBLY.RBPRSSEBTAT 1CN OP .MEMBERS BY PERSONS NOT THEIR OWN NATIONALS. Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal. (Previous Paper: C.P.191(23).)It is desirable that the Cabinet should determine its policy with regard to the British Representatives at the next Assembly as soon as1 possible.     In this connection I venture to call attention to a difference between the Council and the Assembly.Only one person is allowed to represent each State-Memberof the Council, and he must obviously be able to speak for hisGovernment.    In the Assembly three representatives for each country were granted, and a reference to the debates of theLeague of Nations Commission in Paris will shew that the objectof having three was that not only the Government but as far aspossible public opinion of each country should be represented.By the practice established in the Assembly where it is necessaryto vote, the vote is given by the first delegate of each country,and he need not, unless he choses, consult any of his colleagues.In fact when I was representing South Africa the first Delegateseveral times gave a vote with which I was not entirely in agree-ment, and no doubt that happens with other delegations as well -such as the Belgian Delegation where the three representativesare chosen from the three different parties in the State, theLiberal, the Catholic, and the Socialist.     I am personally ofopinion that when Mr. Barnes was one cf our delegates the factthat he did not always speak in the same tones as the Ministers   !who were his colleagues, added greatly to the strength of theBritish Delegation, and I know very much impressed some foreignobservers with the reality of the Assembly&apos;s claim to representNations and not Governments only.I venture-therefore, to urge on my colleagues
m .438that one at least of the three representatives should be chosen from the Opposition.    I have in mind such a man as Mr. Clynes or Mr. Shaw.     I am sure thfct either of those gentlemen could he fully trusted not to do anything which would discrodit the British Delegation, and if they folt hound to express an opinion at variance with th^t held by the Government Members they would do so in such a form.as to leave the authority cf the Government untouched.    I would therefore suggest that the three first delegates should be Mr. Wood, en Opposition Member, and&quot; myself.    This proposal would not interfere in any way.with tho presence of the Prime Minister or Foreign Secretary during tho general Debate with which the proceedings of the Assembly open.   That is very much to bo desired and would give an opportunity for general review of tho International situation which would be of tho highest value.   Ho would, of course be the first Delegate while he was there, and would take the place of either Mr. rfood or myself.   Most of the Delegations now sent.three substitute delegates as well who can take the place of the chief delegate on occasion either in the Assembly itself or, what is more important, on the standing committees of which there are six.    I suggest that we also should send three substitute delegates, and that they should be a woman, Sir Cecil Hurst, who has actod in that capacity before, and whose knowledge is of the groatsst importance to the Delegation, and one other person who should be of different polities to the woman member, if sho were a politician, so as to preserve a kind of balance in tho Delegation.I venture to think, that a delegation so composed would work qui to harmoniously, and would give great satisfaction to those who desire the League to bo a real League of Nations, and would in fact convey to the Assembly a much more real view of the drift of public opinion in this country than could possibly be conveyed by a Delegation representing only one section of thought.(Signed) ROBERT CECIL.12th Junp, 19S3
