PHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRISOTICLmJE^Copy Nor &apos;-: . .rSCEET. 14 JI CABINET,;p0 222 (23),AGRICULTURAL RATES RELIEF IN SCOTLAND. Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland,,1,    In the opening paragraph of his Memorandum of tho 26th instant (C.P.216 (23)) the Chancellor of the. Exchequer refers to the fact that when grants have been given for any purpose to England and Scotland, the Scottish Grant has generally been fixed at ll/80ths of the English Grant - that proportion ipresenting approximately the rati^ in which tho Wo countries&apos;contribute to the Exchequer.    At tho same time he mentions that in certain cases this proportion has been departed from - the Grant being determined by the needs of the service,,2.    On this point the first observation I would make in that tho provision of relief in respect of agricultural rates clearly falls within the second category.     It is a case in which the Grant must be fixed according to the needs of tho service.    The needs of the service&apos;are simply determined by the policy adopted by the State.    In 1896, the Government of the day decided that the rating basi3 of agricultural lands in England should he reduced to 50&apos;%, and a Grant equal to the loss in the produce of the rates automatically followed.    I have explained in a previous memorandum that, to begin with the course taken in Scotland was somewhat different.    The Government first of all in 1896 fixed the Scottish Grant at 11/SOths of the English Grant, AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO SHAPE SCOTTISH POLICY ACCORDING TO THE AMOUNT OF HONEY EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE.   In Scotland, agricultural land represents a higher proportion of the total rateable value than it does in England, and accordingly the Grant of ll/80ths was not sufficient to cover one-half of the rates on agricultural land*    That important fact taken along with other considerations which need not be dwelt upon at this moment, brought about the decision to give a 5/8ths relief on the rating basis in Scotland applicable to farm buildings as well as the land, BUT RESTRICTED TO THE OCCUPIER&apos;S HALF OF THE RATES ONLY.    This left entirely out of -account the other half of the rates collected from the owners and paid by them out of the rents received from the occupiers of tne farms.    Later, in 1898, the Government recognised that the Scottish Grant had been fixed on inequitable lines, and tho Grant was recalculated so as to give Scotland - as England had already been given - one-half of tho TOTAL rates levied on agricultural lands (exclusive of the buildings thereon) whether these rates were payable by owners or occupiers.    This raised the Scottish Grant by nearly  100,000, but the extra money could not then be devoted to relief of agricultural rates without reopening the whole policy laid down in the 1096 Act, and it was-: . docidod to appropriate the money to other purposes as indicated my oa:.-lier memoranda.     It has all along booh a grievance of Scottish agriculturists that this was done - as they have con-sidored. with reason, that the diversion of the extra money to other purposes has rosulted in their being less favourably treats than the English agriculturists.
3,    Notvrithstanding the clear-precedent of 1896-98, the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposes on the present occasion to revert to the ll/80ths principle, and, not only so,; he proposes that only part of tne inadequate grant thus arrived at should be used to relieve the rating burden on farms.    It is difficult to see how this can be reconciled with the announced policy of the Government that arrangements corresponding to those made in England would be made to meet the case of Scotland,4,    In England the fating basis of agricultural lands is proposed to be reduced to 25%.     In Scotland, as I have stated in a previous memorandum, the equivalent rating basis applicable to lands including the buildings thereon is 33-3?6. In order that the agricultural industry may be equally treated in this matter in tne two countries, this reduction io a 53s% basis must apply, like the corresponding reduction in England, to the whole&apos;fates, irrespective of whether they are levied from owners or occupiers.     I see no other way of giving corresponding treatment-to Scotland,    The fact that under the Scottish method of levying rate a- --haig of the rates are levied on the owner --does not reduce the rating burden on the industry by one-half.     If it did, the Scottish system would doubtless have? been adopted long ago in England.5,    The Chancellor suggests that according to the figures put before him by the Scottish Office,  &amp;0Q,000 of tho G-rant which I have stated to be necessary will go directly to relieve the rates on the landowners, while only  50,. 000 will go to relieve the fanner occupier.    If correct, this would undoubtedly be a serious criticism of my proposals.   In the memorandum&apos;R.T.Gr. 7 of 22nd January last, I indicated what was in my mind for adjusting the position as between owner and tenants in the event of a policy for relief of agricultural rates being adopted.    This is a matter upon which discussion between the Treasury and my Department may usefully take- place.6.    I need only make one further observation in ern-cluding the present memorandum.     If  210*000, as suggested by the Chancellor in the final paragraph of his memorandum of 26th instant, ia an adequate measure of the additional relief to be given to the agricultural ratepayer in Scotland, the corresponding relief to England, on the basis of the principles adopted after mature deliberation in 1896, should be approximately  1,000,000, instead of  2,750,000 as publicly announced.    The decision in 1896 (allowing for the 1898 revision) was that the Scottish G-rant should be slightly ever l/5th of the English Grant.    I have asked for a larger proportion on the present occasion in order to rectify the diversion of part of the Scottish Grant to other purposes in 1896 - a diversion from which the Exchequer has for the last 25 years&quot;dorivad considerable&apos; benefit.WAR&apos;.Scottish Office, Whitehall, S.1.50th April, 1.923.
