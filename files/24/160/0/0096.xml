(this poggimsT, is the property of his eritakkic majesty1 s govbrkioiit. )fijTC R B T.(^298(23).8110CABIEET.IRISH CQMPEU3ATI0H.(Kef: Cabinet 33(23) 8(c)) .Memo: by the Lord President of the Council.The relevant undertakings of the Irish Government and of the British Government are very easily recited.   The Irish Government undertook in the Heads of Working Arrangements for Implementing the Treaty of January 1922 that fair compensation should be paid in respect of injuries the subject of compensa-tion under the Criminal Injuries Acts.   The British Government endorsed this undertaking in the letter of July 26th, 1922 in which they said:-&quot;It was also agreed (i.e. between the two Govern-ments) in January last that claims in respect of malicious injuries, whether to persons or property, sustained after July 11th 1921, should be dealt with in the usual way by the County Courts and discharged by the Local Authorities.&quot;Further in this same letter they inferred and indicated approval of an intention of the Irish Government to settle these claims upon a national instead of a local basis.     The fact that this letter was laid before Parliament would have been sufficient to make it clear that the British Govern-ment accepted responsibility for this undertaking of the Irish Government hut the position of the British Government was in fact expressly stated&quot;While the responsibility for meeting these claims to compensation must rest upon the Irish Government His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot divest themselves of a duty to see that such claims are met equitably and as promptly as inevitable difficulties allow.&quot;
And the spirit in which this position was recognised is illustrated further on where the letter, speaking of a particular case, says&quot;In this matter also His Majesty&apos;s government feel that they have a like inalienableresponsibility.&quot;We are thsreifore under an express obligation to see thatequitable compensation is given to the loyalist victims of Irish disorder, and accordingly the Cabinet resolvedupon June 13th last as follows :-Tha Government hold themselves bound by the undertakings given by Mr. Churchill on the11th July 1922 on the subject of compensation and the pledge involved in this &quot;resolution was subsequentlyrepeated in Parliament on behalf of the Government bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Irish loyalist representatives however havestated that the compensation provided by the legislation of the Irish Parliament is in fact not equitable.   Theyshow moreover an increasing unwillingness to accept assufficient the general terms of the engagement of theColonial Secretary to which I have referred,, and it isprobable that if nothing else is done they will continueto press for satisfaction with increasingemphasis and with increasing reflectionupon our good faith.     Sooner or later then it is clearthat we must arrive at an understanding not only amongstourselves but before Parliament as to what willconstitute equitable compensation.     The only questionis how and when?In determining the answer to this question the Cabinet should I think realise what is likelyto happen if things are allowed to   /
remain as they are.     If as I have anticipated in this paper we-have to face Parliamentary criticism in a series of debates of increasing vehemence Ministers will he driven to abandon generalities and to argue the matter more and more in detail.     This is likely to have three results:,-1.     In so far as we differ with the loyalists we shall,have the appearance of opposing our friends.8.     In so far as we agree with them we shall alarm the acceptabilities of the Irish , electorate, with its reaction upon the coming,Irish Election.3.     In so far as we accept in detail the res-ponsibility for compensation we shall induce the Irish Government to laave as much as possible of,the burden upon our shoulders.Ther appears to be to be only one way to avoid these consequences and that is to prevent the public discussion of these questions by taking the Irish loyalist represen-tatives into our complete confidence.     On every ground .. this should be attempted.     We are on both sides anxious to obtain equitable.terms for.the victims * -   We are on both sides conscious that there are limits beyond which it would not be reasonable to press compensation claims. At the same time His Majesty&apos;^ Government have nothing &apos; . to lose by coming to grips with this question because sooner or later as I have shewn that is inevitable.   Even if the Government cannot come to terms with our loyalist friends they have jverything to gain by negotiation which may postpone any public discussion until after the Irish Election. -I Suggest therefore that we should ask the Irish Loyalist organisation to appoint one or two&apos;representatives -preferably/
competent lawyers - to meet one or two corresponding representatives appointed by the British Government and to these representatives should be referred all the vexed issues of Irish compensation in order that if possible an agreement may be come to fir the   -consideration of the Cabinet, upon the basis (l)   cf the pre-Treaty provisions of the criminal Injuries Aots:   and (2)   of the intention of the Irish Government, . substantially endorsed by the British Government, to transfer the settlement of these claims from a local to a national basis, subject to any equitable adjustment which may be prescribed. At the best our representatives may arrive at an agreement with the loyalists&apos; representatives.   At the worst after the discussion our representatives will be able to advise us as tt what they at any rate judge to be fair.   Whichever may be the result I wauld suggest that having, after considering their report, determined in our own mind what is fair we should oommunioate it to the Irish Government and urge upon them to make good any difference there may appear to be between this standard and the provisions of their own Aot,   It may be that Mr. Cosgrave will comply, either before the Election or - as is more probable -after the Election.    If not it is possible that we may find that we have some considerable means *f . pressure which can be applied to him and which may be effective.   But in the long run I suppose it must be admitted that haying accepted responsibility far securing equitable compensation, and having ascertained se
29th June,, 1923.far as is possible what in our judgment the standard of equitable compensation should be-, we shall be&apos; obliged, . failing the compliance of the Irish Government1 to make good the deficiency ourselves.     In this event certain limiting consi derations may perhaps have to &apos;be taken into account in reduction of the face value of the sums awarded, by reason of the improved security involved in the intervention of the British Government-     But this is for the future.     For. the .present the, important thing is, by taking our loyalist friends entirely into our confidence, to prevent the sca^idal^of^a charge of breach of faith by Irish loyalists,.against British Conservatives, and to save the adverse consequences- on the Irish General Election which may follow from&apos; a public discussion upon compensation before, it has taken place. !;&apos;&quot;.,     (Intd.)
