THE gaBMPIOYBP.Apart from the usual propaganda meetings there has notbeen much activity on the part of the unemployed in Englandduring the past week:    in Scotland, however, the movementappears to be making progress.   The following interestingreport was made by H. Mo Shane on  April 25th after a tnur ofthe dist rip 1b mentions a&quot; therein:-&quot;The question of district councils is a difficult one in Scotland.   We have one in the West of Scotland.    I an of the opinion that one should be formed for Stirlingshire and South Clackmannan shire * One for Edinburgh and District;   one in Dundee and district, and one for Aberdeen and district,     This would mean the setting up of committees in districts surrounding these towns.   The question of whether the West of Scotland Council should be split into two or throe should be discussed later,   while in Dundee, I made enquiries regarding the prospects of a district council there.   I found that there are quite a number of towns that should be touched.   I suggested that they should form two or three ocmmittcaa in Dundee, and that thoy in conjunct ion with Locheo could form tho nucleus of a district council.   There arc two towns about thirty milos from Dun do o (fcfcntrose and Perth) that would require to bo brought in, as Dundee is tho nearest town.   Regarding Stirlingshire wo hava several committees there, although they have not been active for some time.   They are fairly olose to Alloa wnich is in Claokmannanshire.   If we get another committee in South Clackmannanshire, we will be lucky,   Now as regards Edinburgh, it should be easy, if the local men will get dowc to it.   Another committee could be formed in Edinburgh.   The leith committee could be made more active, and Broxburn and other towns could be tapped, and a good district council formed,     I have not yet mentica Fifeshire.   Here we have fertile ground. Eii-keaidy is the only committee we have there, but I am certain a number of other towns would respond, if called upon.   Aberdeen is a place I don&apos;t know much about, but from the information I got in Dundee I think a distric council oould be formed there.   Regarding the South of Scot lend, I will make enquiriese   I think there should be room for a district council about Dumfries.   The immediate prospects are Dundee and Edinburgh, if they will move.&quot;The Dundee Unemployed Committee reports &quot;a great influx of new members&quot;.The Scottish Trades Union Congress refused the request of the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement for affiliation and tola the members of the deputation to returnto/
&amp; JL t)to their own Trades Union branches end get their grievances taken up there.Prom the point of view of the organised unemployed the publioation   &quot;Out of Work&quot; has improved raider the editorship of J.M. Freeman:   in its present form it is a useful weapon of class warfare*IRISH RETOIUTIOfl-ARY ACTIVITIES gjj GREAT BRITAINMr. da Valera^ manifesto has attracted very little attention in Irish circles ho re:   most people are tired of him and of his pompous proclamations:   tney regard it as another manoeuvre designed to obtain terms more favourable than any he could hope to procure by force of arms, or   ,.s alternatively to obtain breathing space for hie deluded and demoralised army.     Tho gonsral opinion is that he is beaten and knows it:    no one regards the offer as an honest move towards peaoe.On April 29th about 300 persons assembled at the Battersoa Town Hall to protest against the arrest and deportation of 110 Irish men and women:   George Mortimer, Secretary of the Batiersea Branch, Irish Self-Determination League, was in the Chair and claiasd tbet, in spite of da Vaisiars proclamation, the Irish Republic still functioned vi.goror.siy and there was no need to be pessimistic.     In the absence of Maud Gonne MeBride, who is in custody in Ireland, Mrs. Mason of lewoastle was the principal speaker.   She complainsd that the Independsct labour party at their Easter Cos!ereaoe, had no word of sympathy or support for Ireland, although profuse in their sympathy for Germany, Egypt, India and other countries a safe distance away.     Joseph Fowler of Twickenham alluded to the fact that so few people attendedto/
to pay the last respects to &quot;that great Irishman&quot; Laurence Ginnell, whose body was then lying in Corpus Christ! church, Maiden Lane, and saia the reason for this was that the British Government, in collusion with the United states Authorities, had tampered with the cables in order to prevent a demonstration on the arrival of the body.   Fowler also alluded to da Valera^ manifesto and said th^re was no need for pessimism.   He was personally convinced that a good and sufficient reason would appear for its is sue aLiverpool and the Irish districts of the North have been very quiet:   on April 29th there was a fairly large Bepubliana meeting at 925, Scotland Road, Liverpool, to hoar a statement on the general situation by Harry Rarte, a local Irish-labour agitator, who is apparently trying to bring in the Communist element.An Irish and Catholic Democratic Federation has bean launched at Liverpool, pending the Leeds Conference on Whit Saturday, and may torn tho nucletis of whatever new Irish orgarir ation is eventually forruetioCountess Marksevicis is still in Glasgow and adareused a meeting of the Conolly Club on April ESth:   she cannot hcia her ancUonces at all well:   there was a good deal of hockling on the question of a &quot;Workers Republic&quot; and the chairman. Liam Travers, had to intervene,,     Something lifco a scene followed and the mac ting came to an abrupt termination.Special Ceilidhs   (Social gatherings) are to be ran for the purpose of raising money for the prisoners Defence fund and the local Irish Republican Axmy are tQ..be asked to provide stewards.The Republican Journal &quot;Eire&quot; ie now being printed byWlii to ley/ -
*7hiteley and fright, &quot;The Equity Press&quot;, 30, Blacfcfriars St., Manchester:   the reason for this change has not appeared, but both Humphreys and Little, who are running it were anxious to get away from the Glasgow Polioe who hold deportation orders for them. -
