iT^gOOIMBNg. IS. THE.PROPERTY Og HIS BRITUUIQ MAJESTY &apos;3 GOVERNMaHT,IMS- / ^^l.P.236(gg). 0 A B I N E T. *-3Business of the House Tuesday, 29th May to Friday 10th August.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour en the position of trade boards Bill,(1)   I havo read with some anxiety the memorandum submitted to tho Cabinet by the Chief Whip.   Uo mention is made in his lime Tabls Iof the Trade Boards Bill.     I must press upon my oolleagues that it is essential that a day should be given for the second reading I of this Bill before the House adjourns.   Lord Oave!s Committee Ipresanted a unanimous report on the subject ef Trade Boards nine [months ago;   a Bill to carry out the recommendations of this [Oommittee was promised in the King&apos;s Speech and the policy of Introducing the Bill has been sanctioned on more than one occasion &apos;by the Cabinet,   On 18th January the matter was referred to a Sub-iConanittee of the Cabinet and on their report the outlines of a [Bill were approved by the Cabinet on the 26th January.   The Bill in final shape was considered by the Home Affairs Committee and was [approved by them subject to two points; these points were considered lin Cabinet and. the Bill finally approval on the 2nd May0   The lOabinst Minute Btates that the Bill should be printed before lliiitsun with a view to a Second Reading after tfiiitsun, 1(2)   It must further be borne in mind that the whole Trade Boards^ jatoinistration is. at the moment labouring under very considerable jiifficulties pending the passing of the proposal Bill,   The Bill [Will be a codifying measure0   It will restrict the creation of new [Boards somewhat in the future and in addition it will amend the [Existing machinery and facilitate general working..   Unless the Pill is passed into law at an oarly date I see very great difficulty p the administration of Trade Boards.   lot only so, but I have seen/many
many deputations sinoe the beginning of the year and arranged that many matters of urgency should stand ewer pending the Introduction of the Bill, and I have given, in accordance with the policy of the Cabinet, distinct pledges in the matter.Under these circumstances if the Bill is not introduced by the Government my position becomes one of extreme difficulty,, (3)    It may well be that the labour Party will show considerable hostility to the Bill because it will, in future, limit somewhat the oreation of Trade Boards, mainly on the ground that the old law, as in 1909, will be restored and &quot;low wages&quot; will always be an essential condition for the establishment of a Board.     If the labour Party choose to kill the Bill in Committee, the odium of the confusion which may arise in Trade Board administration in consequence will fall upon them. I still have hope that, if the Bill is given a second reading forthwith, some adjustment may be come to with the labour Party in Committee.    But what I cannot accept is that no day should now be given for the second reading of the Bill and the Bill in effect be thrown over by the Government.     That would reverse the policy already laid down by the Cabinet and entail the violation of pledges given by myself in accordance with that policy.     Moreover it would threw upon the Government the odium of the difficulties which are bound to arise in consequence.What makes the matter all the more serious is that while the Trade Boards Bill, which is not mentioned in the Tims Tahsle, was&apos; given a place in the Klng!s Speech many measures which were not mentioned in the Eiug&apos;s Speech and which have only recently come into prominence, e-go, the Pre-war Pensioners&apos; Bill and the Workmen1s Compensation Bill, do figure in the Time Table.(Initialled) M.B.8th May, 19E3.
