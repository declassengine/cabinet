Period ended May 18, 1923.SUMMARY OF UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.The number of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as wholly unemployed at the 14th May was 1,168,521, a decrease of 35,275 on the previous week.POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.COAL-MINING.Activity in the Forest of Dean coal-field has continued, and the Somerset coal-field has shown a slight improvement. The collieries in the Midlands, Yorkshire, Durham and Scotland have also been very active. Employment in the Welsh collieries has been better and the output maintained. Apart from an industrial dispute at Whitehaven, the Lancashire and Cumberland coal-fields are making good progress.IRON AND STEEL.The gradual improvement in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the North of England has been maintained, but any tendency towards further improvement is likely to be checked, especially in Scotland and the North of England, by the industrial dispute among the boiler-makers. The improvement in the North of Wales has been maintained, while in the South a further improvement has occurred.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.There has been no improvement in the position in this industry, and the continuance of the industrial dispute is having a retarding effect.ENGINEERING.In the Home Counties activity has continued in the motor section, but general engineering has been quiet. In the South-Western Counties trade has not been brisk, but the gradual improvement has continued. The tendency towards improvement in the Midlands has been maintained. Employment in Yorkshire and the North of England has improved. The situation in Scotland has not shown any marked improvement. The improvement in certain areas in South Wales has been maintained, but conditions generally are not very bright. The position of textile and general engineering in Lancashire has not been favourable, but activity has been manifest in the motor section.TEXTILES.Cotton. The situation in Lancashire has continued to be quiet, and output continues to be restricted.   In Yorkshire the depression has continued.
Hosiery, Woollen and Worsted.-There has been little change in the position in the Midlands. In the West Riding of Yorkshire trade has continued to be in a very depressed condition.   Some improvement is shortly expected in Scotland.Silk. Trade has been good and prospects have continued bright at Derby and Longton, but at Nuneaton and Leek there has been no improvement.Lace. Trade has continued brisk at Chard, but at Exeter unemployment among women workers has increased. The position in the Midlands is depressed except in the curtain and plain net sections.Jute. A further industrial dispute has occurred at Dundee. Unemployment among female operatives has, however, decreased at Arbroath.BUILDING.The marked improvement which has recently been a feature of this industry has been maintained.BOOT AND SHOE.The improvement in the Home Counties has continued, but at Norwich trade has recently fallen off a little. The improvement which has taken place at many centres in the Midlands has been maintained.CLOTHING.Apart from the manufacture of blouses and shirts, activity in the Home Counties has continued. In the South-Western Counties also dressmaking and tailoring have been fairly busy. Except for isolated activity at certain centres, trade has decreased in the Midlands.POTTERY.The anticipated improvement in the Midlands has not yet fulfilled expectations. TINPLATE.Employment has continued good and production has been normal. Latterly, however, there has been a decrease in shipments.TRANSPORT.Trade in the London Docks generally has continued slack. At Bridgwater, Penzance and Falmouth transport workers are busy, but other docks in the South-Western Counties have continued inactive. On the North-East Coast the slight improvement has continued, and the outlook is good. The situation at the Welsh Docks remained&apos; fair, Newport and Holyhead having both shown some improvement. The usual seasonal activity in fruit traffic has been evident on the Mersey, but there is very little trade in heavy merchandise.C. A. MONTAGUE BARLOW, Ministry of Labour.

SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN.[From Autumn 1920 onwards.] Cabinet Unemployment Committee.The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On.the 13th August, 1920, the then Cabinet appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee to consider the whole, question and devise means for relieving: unemployment. This Committee continued to function till October 1922. The present Government appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee on the 1st November, 1922. &apos;(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards. rates, of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, amalgamated the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extended until June 1923 the special periods during which benefit might be drawn.   The authority to borrow
money from the Treasury was increased to  30,000,000, By the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1923, which came into operation on the 12th April, 1923, the special periods for the payment of benefit have been extended to October 1923. Special provision has also been made by this Act for the following year to October 1924.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants), and the Contributions during the period from the 8th November, 1920, to the 12th May, 1923.1.

Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement Of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from, autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 300,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various-times, and at the present time over 150,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits-Scheme.(C.) Extensions of Remedial Measures during the Winter 1922-23.Some of the measures comprised in (B) above are still in operation, e.g., past sanctions of grants by the Unemployed Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport. The Export Credits Scheme continues, and schemes approved under the Trade Facilities Act are in progress.In June 1922. the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport issued circular letters to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the relief of unemployment in their respective areas. Approved schemes are assisted by grants made on the same bases as heretofore. In the case of schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee, particulars&apos;of grants already sanctioned are set out below.In September 1.922, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circular letters to County Councils (except&apos;the London County Council) and. Drainage Authorities, inviting them to submit schemes of land drainage which, if approved, might be assisted on fundamentally the same conditions as those applicable in the-[10052] e 3
case of schemes assisted .&apos;last year. All applications were to be received in the case of Drainage Authorities on or before December 1, 1922, and in the case of County Councils (Agricultural Committees) on or before December 16, 1922. County Councils were also circulated with regard to schemes for the supply of water to farms, the conditions of assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries remaining substantially the same as last winter, with the exception that the Ministry, instead of advancing the whole cost ot any scheme and recovering a proportion from the owners concerned, will make grants to cover part only of the total cost of each scheme. Further circulars, issued to County Councils and Drainage Authorities on the 5th and .6th December respectively, notified the extension of the date up to which applications might be received to the 13th January, 1923, arid invited the submission of additional schemes. The time for receiving applications was further extended provisionally to the 10th February, 1923. Particulars of grants sanctioned and of the number of men employed to date are shown below (see table 6).On the 30th November, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, outlined the manner in which measures taken by the late Government would be continued and extended. The additional sums promised in extension of existing funds are set out below :  Unemployment Grants Committee (for grants on the basis of60 per cent, of Wages Bill) ... ... ......        600,000Land Drainage ... .;. ... ... ...        170,000Afforestation......        ... .........        100,000Acceleration of Government contracts Office of Works    ... ... ... 375,000General Post Office ... ... 946,000-     1,321,000It was also then announced that guarantees under the Trade Facilities Act Scheme would be made available up to  50,000,000 ( 25,000,000 extra); that the Export Credits Scheme would be extended if necessary; and that the Local Authorities concerned would be asked to co-operatexin putting in hand the Manchester-Liverpool Eoad, which would involve an expenditure of about  3,000,000, half of it from the Road Fund.In December 19-22, the Unemployment Grants Committee issued a further circular letter to Local Authorities, inviting them to submit schemes suitable for assistance on the basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill, i.e., works the cost of which is normally defrayed out of revenue and not by loan. The conditions under which grants may be sanctioned are substantially the same as those previously in force, except that in -the case of Rural Districts the Committee have discretion to allow, where clearly necessary, a modification of the conditions regarding the giving of preference to 75 per cent, ex-service men and the engagement of labour through the Employment Exchanges.On the 12th December, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, further announced that, in addition to the acceleration of contracts by the Post Office and Office of Works, previously described, the Admiralty would accelerate miscellaneous works to a total of about  365,000; whilst the Home Office would puf in hand certain accelerated building work, together with repairs to buildings, including Police Stations.On the 13th December, 1922, the Forestry Commission issued a press notice to the effect that forestry grants were available for the relief of unemployment on the same general conditions as those applicable to grants made last winter. The sum of  100,000 referred to above is to be used partly for this purpose and partly for the purpose of relief schemes in Crown Forests and for additional work in the Commission^ forests by the Trade Facilities and Loans Guarantee Act, 1922 (Session 2), enacted on the 15th December, 1922, formal sanction was given for the increase of the aggregate capital amount of loans the principal or interest of which mav be guaranteed under the Trade Facilities Act, 1921, from  25,000,000 to  50,000,000.On the 15th February, 1923, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, announced an extension of  5,600;000 in the amount available for grants in respect of approved road works by the Ministry of Transport.
