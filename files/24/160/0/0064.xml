June 7th, 1923.REPORT ON REVOLUTIONARY ORGANISATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOMTHE COMMUNISTS............................... Page 1THE RED INTERNATIONAL OP LABOUR UNIONS....... &quot;     4THE YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUE................... &quot;    6THE UNEMPLOYED............................... &quot; -8IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN CHEATBRITAIN................................. &quot;     9SUMMARYOn May 28th the wholly unemployed on the live registers totalled approximately 1,221,300, en increase of 13,902 on the preceding week:   on the same date the number working short time and drawing benefit for intervals of unemployment was 51,600 as compared with 51,877 on May 21st.There has been no abatement in the campaign of the Communist Party of Great Britain against the British Government in connection with the Russian situation, but it is arousing little interest outside the Party membership.The Communist Party is renewing its efforts to secure affiliation to the Labour Party.A circular recently issue a by the Ezeoutive Committee of the Young Communist International regarding the finance of the various national leagues is quoted in this report.
the ooMBroaisspsThe Communist Party has not slackened its efforts on behalf of the soviet Government:   the speeches made and articles published contain, however, practically no new matter:   the Party&apos;s attitude is aumrod up in thefollowing paragraph, taken from a manifesto issue a bythe Executive and published in &quot;The Workers&apos; Weekly&quot;of June 2nd:wThere can be no security against war, nor hope of stopping the preparations for war, nor the slightest cessation in the attacks upon the working class so long as Cur son1 s Government is in power.   Only eternal vigilance and incessant work, and effort to overthrow this Government and secure the establishment of a real workers&apos; government can bring peace to the world or free the masses from their misery.   We again urge the-workers not to slacken in their protests against the British Government, and to proceed with all haste to organise its forces to supersede it.&quot;It is reported that on May 3rd the ExecutiveCommittee of the Third International sent a letter toijtuelch in whioh satisfaction with the activities of theExecutive of the Communist Party was expressed:   theletter continued:&quot;In consideration of the difficulties whioh are likely to arise in the mutual relations between Soviet Eussia and Imperialist England, the Executive Committee is of opinion that the apparatus employed up till now by the Third International in its relations with the British Communist Party will reguire to be improved and adapted to the problems of the moment.   Should a conflict ensue between England and the Soviet Government, the direct connection which exists between the Executive Committee of the Third International and the Executive Bureau of the Party would doubtless ha interrupted.   It is therefore necessary.to begin the immediate organisation of auxilary lines of connection by the help of which it will be possible to confer with lohdon or Portsmouth.   It would certainly be best to arrange a connection via Sweden, but the Swedish Communist Party is at the moment hardly in a position to carry out this important task.    This being the case we must establish the connection by courier via Stockholm-Happaranda independently, with the indirectco-operation/
co-operation of the Swedish Communist Party, but without its direct participation.   As to the funds which the Executive Committee fee1b it necessary to place, as in the past, at the disposal of the British Communist Party, the amounts will be drawn on Stockholm in the name of the Bureau of the Trade Union of Miners or of the Seamen&apos;s union of Portsmouth^ $he money orders will, as formerly, be placed at the 1 disposal of Comrades Ivihlboom  and landerock, who will present a monthly account to the Finance Section of the Executive Committee of the Third International.&quot;The accounts rendered and the report made periodically on the agitation activities of the British Communist Party, should be forwarded to the Executive Committee by special couriers appointed by the Union of Merchant Seamen.   In view of the difficulties of delivery, a not inconsiderable delay may be expected before correspondence is received. (This delay must not be allowed to affect the work of the Party.)&quot;The Executive Committee of the Third International expresses its unqualified approval of the activities of the Executive Bureau of the British Communist party and especially of its programme of agitation and of the work undertaken by the Bureau among the unemployed without first receiving instructions from the Executive Committee, work which, nevertheless, has produced excellent results.   The results of the Party&apos;s work among the members of the labour Party in England are rather less satisfactory, but not to the extent deserving of any reproach on the part of the Executive Committee of the Thira International.&quot;The issue of &quot;The Workers1 Weekly&quot; for June 2nd, whichoonsists of six pages instead of the usual four, containstwo expressions of the communist attitude towards Parliamentsthe first is an unsigned article entitled &quot;Hewboia versusParliament - Communist Tactics in Action&quot;, in the course ofwhich it is stated that:&quot;Certain regulations have to be observed.   And here let it be noted that the statements circulated to the effect that Hewbold wanted to apologise, etc., are not true.   The Communist party neither withdraws its ohallenge nor modifies its repudiation of the lies of the Tdry mob.   Comrade Bewbold in this matter as in all other political mattere took his lead from the Party Executive, consulted those who had rallied to his support, and sent in a letter conforming to regulations in order to meet our opponents again face to faoe.&quot;The letter neither apologises for the ohallenge nor withdraws it, but removes personal difficulties to reveal more clearly the class fight.&quot;The/
The second reference is the reply sent by 3. SaklatvalaM.P., to a circular protest received from the secretaryof the Birmingham Irish Salf-Determination League regardingthe Irish deportations;&quot;The British Empire ia made up of the aristocratic and cunning &quot;dirty dogs&apos; of Great Britain, who will assail anyone&apos;s country, any time.   The British Parliament&apos;b chief function and purpose of existence is to maintain intact that Empire and to retain all the stolen property and to keep under bondage all the bullied nations.&quot;The immediate release of all deportees was demanded as far as the regulations of parliamentary Democracy permitted.   It was refused under the acknowledged constitutional right of Parliamentary Governments to preserve Law and order by ignoring rights.   Parliamentary etiquette and decorum now prohibit further talk on the Bame subject.&quot;Undaunted by frequent rebuffs in the past, theCommunist Party intends to make another attempt to secureaffiliation to the Labour Party and removal of the banimposed by the Edinburgh resolution when  the jinnualConference of the Labour Pwrty is held in London this month.A circular issued by the political Secretary to LocalParty Committees states that:&quot;The necessary work to be done can be conveniently divided into three, and ooncarns first the securing and notifying to us at headquarters of the maximum number of Communist Party delegates, secondly the instruction of these and other delegates wherever possible in a manner favourable to Communist policy with regard to the Labour Party, and thirdly the oreation of an atmosphere and&apos; opinion amongst the rank and file of the Labour Party favourable to this same policy.&quot;The following draft resolution is to be passed by tradeunion branches wherever possible:&quot;That this Branch of the...........(here insertname of Union) is of opinion that its delegates at the Labour Party Conference in June should support amendments to the Labour Party Constitution which have as their object to secure complete freedom to affiliated Trade Unions, nationally and locally, in their choice of delegates to the Labour P^rty, provided such delegates are bona-fide members of the Union, whatever other working-class organisations they may happen to belong to.&quot;That/
&quot;That this Branch of tho..............(insertas above) realises that the united front of all working-class organisations to the capitalist attacks on the wages, hours, and general standard of life of the working class must be formed on the political field as well as the industrial.   It therefore calls on its delegates to the Labour Party Conference in June to&apos;support the affiliation to the labour Party of the Communist Party, as this is a bona-fide working-class political party.&quot;According to the seoret &quot;Industrial Bulletin&quot;, issued on Hay 24th, the Industrial Committee at headquarters has set up special sub-sections for work in the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the national Union of Eailwaymen and the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement:   the committee is dissatisfied with the work cone by trade union group nuclei and is urging that more attention should be paid to this phase of communist activity.   . Railway members -have received definite instructions as to the line they are to take in regard to various resolutions on the agenda for the Annual General meeting of the National Union of Railwayman and have also been told to &quot;force a resolution through their respective branches dealing with the ultimatum against Russia.&quot;J.T. Walton Newbold informed e friend on Hay 31st that he intended to go to Germany    this week &quot;en route for the East&quot;.TBS REP IHEERUA&apos;? IOIAX OP LABOUR UUIOflSInteresting light is thrown on the reasons for the postponement of the Moscow meetings which were to have beenattended by British delegates of the Communist party andthe,Red International of Labour Unions in a letter whichrecently passed between two of the leaders of the lattermovement in this country:&quot;Since we discussed the matter on Hay Lay, important matters of a political character bearing upon the relations between this country and Russiahave/
if 5 **405have arisen, the seriousness of the position in whioh the soviet Government found itself, demanded the fullest attention by the responsible authorities.-   &quot;The result of that deliberation brought about radical changes in the original plans of the Communist International and the Red International of Labour Unions executive, the preparations made for discussing the situation in this country, with practically the whole of the E,C sn&amp; a number of other comrades present, has to all intents and purposes been cancelled for an indefinite period, and the majority of the comrades have returned from the Half-way house.&quot;The extended .LS.C. meeting will probably take place some time in June, if tho present gloomy outlook can be successfully disposed of, but from the Party point of view only two delegates will be present, as far as we are concerned no notification of any changes have been officially reoeived, but it is certain that the sessions of tho Profintern will not be held- prior to the sessions of the Communist International.&quot;On May 31st another letter passed between the samemen:     the reference made therein to the expected arrival of money and of news concerning the Russian Trade delegation on tho same afternoon is not uninteresting:&quot;...1 will not delay the payment, although our position at this juncture is preoarious enough, still this afternoon I am expecting a rift in the cloud if that transpires I will inform you to-morrow,&quot;Bo further developments have transpired with regard to the Delegation, this also I am&quot; expecting to receive some information on this afternoon,&quot;The Bureau of the International Federation of Trade Unions has disclaimed responsibility for the BeSlin conference reported last week and has affirmed that &quot;it is within tho framework of the regular organisations of each country that labour Unity can and must be achieved.&quot;ihe British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions considers that the admission of the Sussian Transport workers &quot;has changed the position&quot; and has therefore decided to give Robert Williams &quot;a deoent show&quot; in &quot;The Worker&quot;, as &quot;we are desirous of securing as much support from this quarter as it is logically possible.&quot;
fljjj YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUEThe following is a copy of a document recently sent from Berlin to a &quot;secret&quot; address in this country and constitutes further evidence of the fact that British sections of the Communist International are subsidized from Russian sources:&quot;Financial Circular Moscow, May 18th, 19 23.Extremely LaportantfTo the National Executive Committee of all Young Communist Leagues.Lear Comrades,(l)    Already in the beginning of January the B.C. requested the Leagues to forward their account on the year 1922.   Altho we urged you repeatedly, only a few Leagues have settled their accounts.    As a consequence of this state of affairs, the budget of the LCI. for the second quarter could not he decided upon until now and therefore the Leagues could not yet receive any money (apart from money in advance).     We have in time drawn the attention of the leagues to the necessary consequences of their neglect and it ia -therefore their own fault, that they have not yet received money or only insufficient amounts.   This neglect is the more irresponsible, as those Leagues, that have failed to fulfil their duty in this direction handicap also the work of those Leagues (among them the largest of the LCI.) who have promptly forwarded their accounts.   As those Leagues oan no longer be hampered in their work and as the whole work of the Y. C.I. cannot be damaged hy the neglect of some of our Leagues, the Y.C.I. has made it possible and decided that the money for the second quarter will be paid now in spite of the fact that we have not yet received all accounts.   We request the national Executive Committees, however, to urge their financial departments to fulfil their obligations efficiently in the future and to make them responsible for the neglect,.The following Leagues have settled their accounts: Germany, Austria, Italy, Finland, iiweden, Checho-Slovakia, Far East,(2)   We repeat our decision:   that those Leagues that have not forwarded the account on the first quarterof 2925 will not receive the money for the third quarter.From now on this rule will be in force continuous&quot;&quot;^ The League must forward an account on the past quarter at the beginning of the next quarter and they receive the money for the following second quarter only if they &apos; have settled their accounts for. the quarter before the last.   Thus, an account for the second quarter is necessary to receive the money for the fourth quarter, etc.
(3)   We reratna the leagues of the decision, that they must not only forward their accounts, but also ,. their budgets every quarter.(4)   The most important problerr   of our international finances is already for a long dime the necessity that our Leagues become more and more self-supporting and the costs of the international apparatus decrease. The E.C. will elaborate thoro directives and suggestions on this question for the international  &apos;;-Bureau Session.   It is necessary that you consider this problem already now and elaborate suggestions. : It is imperative that the money for the third quarter, as far as it, destined for current expenses., is decreased.An important item of the problem is the increase of the income of the LCI.    We must at any rate bring ab,out a state of affaire, when the expenses of our international publishing house are paid by the Leagues.   Also for us the time of &quot;war communism&quot; has passed long ago and we must,iestablish for our work a sort of HEP (new economic policy).With communist groetings,The Executive Committee of theYoung Communist Liternational.&quot;Although there is littleindio&amp;tion that the Young Communist league has made progress with its anti-militarism campaign, interest attaches to a letter published in the June issue of the&quot;Young Communist&quot; over the pseudonym &quot;Signalman&quot;:   the text of the letter is as follows:-&quot;Comrades,&quot;This is a message, a warning, an appeal - what you will, but it is, nevertheless, a solemn statement mads not without careful study and consideration.&quot;For reasons which may easily bo guessed, the writer&apos;s identity cannot be disclosed, he being one of Zing George&apos;0 hired assassins, but in case there us any Thomas Lidymus, the mere fact that this letter has been accepted by your editor (who will, I am sure, vouch forme) should be sufficient..&quot;How comrades, I think you are all agreed that ^ie Young Communists are a militant body, who do not wish for bloodshed;   but if capitalism in its fall foroes our hand in that direction, we must be prepared to fight with every weapon at our disposal.&quot;Let us not be deceived.    The old order changeth, giving place to the new, so, the old polioy of &quot;Love and Justice&quot; is now known by all hard-thinking revolutionaries to be futile and gives prides of nlaceto/
- G -to the new ana only feasible doctrine that capitalism must he fought by us as capitalism will fight us.   We must use the weapons of capitalism to fight on equal terms.   This means that when the Great Outbreak arrives we must be prepared for war, a bloody war if it must be, ugly as the thought may s9em, love will be no shield against bullets, the sword, bombs and poison gas, the enemy cannot be subdued by a pelting with chunks of Justice and specious words.   Does any reasoning person still believe that capitalism will, at the round table, over the nuts and wine, say &apos;You have: convinced me;   you are right;     all I have is yours -take it and use it for the betterment of mankind, and may God forgive me for my sins?M&quot;All comrades in the navy, the Army and the Air force must get together to discuss their grievances, and commence a struggle against the enhanced conditions in the Services.&quot;The Army of to-day, comprising as it does men who have, for the most part been driven into it by ;;economic pressure and not by love of King and Country, is a menace to us because it knows who provides its bread and butter.   We must take up the struggle against tho death penalty, against long service periods, against bad food and insufficient leave and low pay,&quot;I for one shall be glad to see the proposals of other lads in the forces for a common Btruggle for the soldiers&apos; and sailors&apos; rights.&apos;&quot;The Editor of the paper adds that:-&quot;Tho y. C.I)., of course, will support the proposal, and we shall be glad to receive more letters from soldiers and sailors on the subject.   Our e:cpoaure of &quot;Flogging in the Navy&apos;, and our practical proposals for dealing with it, will, be remembered by all readers, most of all our sailor readers..&quot;ggg UHEMPIiOIEDThe demonstration held under the auspices of the National Unemployed Workers1 Committee Movement in Trafalgar Square on June Sra was a failure f ran the point of view ,of the organisers:   at no time were there more than about 506 people present, despite the. fact that the speakers were J. Holt   and H. Homer   (National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement), Nat Watkins (Red International of labour Unions), Horace Young (Toung Communist League), Helen Crawfurd (Russian famine Relief Committee and Communist party) and J. Brotherton, M,P,
The speeches followed fairly closely the lines of theresolution which was as follows:-&quot;This MasB Meeting assembled in Trafalgar Square views with alarm the threat of Lord, Curson, who acting on behalf of the British Government is attempting to cause a Breach in the Relations at present existing between this country end Russia.   It believes that the opon declarations into Russian policy of the British Foreign Office if put into effect would be disastrous to the whole of the workers of this country,   it particularly deprecates any action that would lead to &quot;armed intervention in Russia, believing that such action would still further aggravate the already serious problem of unemployment,. It further calls for the immis&amp;iate resignation of lord Curzon, the Foreign Secretary, whose pernicious influence has been largely responsible for the present Government attitude.&quot;On May 31st some 500 people collected outside the CountyCouncil Offices, Woodstoolr. Road, poplar, while the AuditorI   was inside the building in connection with the accounts:   the&quot;Red Flag&quot; was sung as the Councillors and Auditor left andCouncillor Thome was hooted and ourssd but although thejcrowd surged towards him, there wbb no violence.RISE REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAINSo far there seems to be no great hurry about forming branches of the new Irish Democratic League;   its promoters possibly feel that their best policy is to move slowly.A reception in honour of the London ex-deporteee is to begiven at a Colidhe Mor (Grand Festival) to be held at theHolborn Hall, on June 12th:   the proceeds of the Celidhe- Morare to be used for the defence of Art 0&apos;Brien and his fellowprisoners:   a similar Celidhe Mor will be held at the Hatcham liberal Club on June 15th.Leading Irishmen in this country are by no means happyabout the approaching election in Ireland:   labour troublesare causing some uneasiness and most of them doubt if thepresent Free State Government will be Returned.   The only hope,they/
-10 -410they eay^ Is in a coalition with the Farmers&apos; Tartyr --an. ^Mit-raW between Republicans ana labour would be fatal.The Republican organisation in Scotland is still active, although some of the leaders, who apparently fear re-arrest, are taking their holidays early this year.   Madame Markievioa is still in Glasgow and is booked to speak at meetings until July.   Brown, the organiser, is to visit the various Irish centres including Dundee and will be absent for about a month.
