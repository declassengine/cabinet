[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,]Printed for the Cabinet.9 9 ?SECRET.CP. 234 (23). i QCABINET.COMMITTEE ON THE PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATURE of state SERVANTS.Repoet.1. THE Cabinet constituted us a Committee to examine the question of parliamentary candidature by State Servants, and to report our conclusions to the Cabinet.   (Cabinet 11 (23), Conclusion 3.)2. We have carefully considered the original Treasury Memorandum OP. 117 (23) which was circulated to the Cabinet on the 19th February last, together with notes subsequently issued by the Admiralty (C.S.S. 2), the Post Office (C.S.S. 3), the Air Ministry (C.S.S. 4), and the War Office (C.S.S. 5).3. A Civil Servant is required by clause 16 of the. (Consolidating) Order in Council of the 10th January, 1910, to resign his position (so soon as he issues his address to the electors or in any other manner, publicly announces himself as a candidate) for election to the House of Commons. On the other hand, a Naval or Military Officer by virtue of section 27 of 6 Anne, cap. 41, and an Air Force Officer by virtue of section 4 of the Air Force (Constitution) Act, 1917, is free to stand for Parliament without such action on his part entailing resignation or retirement, and this principle has been extended to the rank and file of those three Services.There is thus an absolute differentiation in this matter between the treatment of the Civil Service on the one hand and the Fighting Services on the other.4. We are aware that in support of such a differentiation it is pleaded that, whereas the Civil Service is concerned with the day-to-day life of the country, the Fighting Services are remote from it. We are, however, clear that the general sense of the community, manifesting itself through political pressure, would find this (still more any other) line of argument quite unconvincing in face of the indisputable fact that of the four great Services of the Crown the three Fighting Services are in a position of privilege as compared with the Civil Service, although equally with the latter they are the servants of Government.5. Large and important groups of Civil Servants have during the past.&quot;year or two drawn attention with growing emphasis to this, discrimination, and have already secured the support of one of the great political parties, viz., the Labour party.Once raised, a problem of this character has to be dealt with one way or another.6. There are three possible alternatives: to leave things as they are, or to bring the Civil Service into line with the Fighting Services, or to bring the Fighting Services into line with the Civil Service.The first is obviously not practical politics. The second spells the eventual politicalisation of the Service which under Government carries on the day-to-day administration of the country here and overseas. And once it is open to any individual member of the Civil Service to be publicly identified with particular party programmes and cries, and at the same time to remain a Civil Servant, his capacity vis-a-vis the public (and of course the Government of the day) to perform his duty as the servant of the public is gone. He will at once be regarded as a partisan by some and as an opponent by others, but as their servant by none. And in the process of action and interaction he will, in fact, become more and more a partisan or an opponent. [9973J
7. The third alternative is to bring the Fighting Services into line with the Civil Service.If it is impossible to behave as if no problem existed and to do nothing, if it would be disastrous to extend to the Civil Service the privilege permitted to the Fighting Services, then the Fighting Services must be content to be servants of Government and to forgo the potentiality of becoming politicians.8. We have no hesitation in recommending this alternative&apos;8&apos; to the Cabinet, and,.although it is not relevant to our conclusion and has had no influence on us in reaching it, we feel little doubt that all serving officers and men with a real interest and pride in their Service and they must be the overwhelming majority-are absolutely devoid of all political aspirations and will be entirely indifferent to the change which we recommend.9. If the Cabinet endorse our view, consideration of the means to give effect to ,it will be necessary.The best safeguard for the future would be the enactment of a one-clause Bill which could provide (in suitable language) that (a) all retired servants of the Crown shall be free to stand for Parliament (they are, in fact, so now), and (5) any servant of the Crown who desires to stand for Parliament shall be at liberty to do so on resignation or, if he has qualified by length of service, age, &amp;c, for pension, on retiring.Pending legislation, an Order in Council to the same effect might be made covering all four Services, under the authority of which the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry would refuse permission to any of .their officers or men desirous of availing themselves of their privileges under the Acts of Queen Anne and of 1917 (as extended administratively).10. We accordingly recommend (1.) That as regards the Civil Service no alteration be made in the existing rule which requires a Civil Servant to resign his position as soon as he issues his address to the electors or in any other manner publicly announces himself as a candidate for election to the House of Commons.(2.) That the above rule be extended forthwith to all members of the three Fighting Services. N(3.) That any State Servants who are already members of the existing House of Commons be allowed to retain the privilege for the lifetime of the present Parliament.(4.) That a short Bill be drafted providing, in effect (a.) That all retired servants of the Crown shall be free to stand for Parliament; and (b.) That any servant of-the Crown who desires to stand-for parliament shall be at liberty to do so on resignation or, ifhe has qualified by length of service, age, &amp;c, for pension, onretiring;and that every effort be made to secure the passage into law of the proposed legislation with as little delay as possible.(5.) That, pending legislation, an Order in Council be made covering all four Services, under the authority, of which the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry would refuse permission to any of their officers or men &apos; desirous of availing themselves of their legal privileges, as extended administratively.Signed on behalf of the Committee, CAVE.(Signed)        R. B. Howorth,Secretary to the Committee.J2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, May 8, 1923.* State Servants who are already Members of the existing House of Commons could be allowed retain the privilege for the lifetime of the present Parliament.
