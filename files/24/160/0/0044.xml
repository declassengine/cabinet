[This Document is,the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1923.SECRET;- 18C.P. 244 (23). CABINET.SPECIAL REPORT ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 91.    Period ended May 4, 1923.SUMMARY OF UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.The number of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as wholly unemployed at the 30th April was 1,218,267, a decrease of 16,638 on the previous, week.POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.COAL-MINING.The activity which has been a feature in all centres of this industry has been: maintained.IRON AND STEEL.In the Midlands there has been a gradual improvement which, it is hoped, will continue. In Yorkshire and the North of England the situation has continued to show a slight improvement, but the outlook is unsettled. The position in Scotland has been fair, but prospects are indefinite. In the North of Wales there has been considerable activity, while conditions in the South have also improved. The dispute in the shipyards may have an adverse effect upon this industry..SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.This industry has been affected as the result of the industrial dispute among boilermakers. It is generally expected, however, that should a solution be quickly reached, activity will be renewed.ENGINEERING.The position in the Home Counties has remained quiet, but in the South-Western Counties a steady improvement has been noticed. At most centres in the Midlands a general improvement has occurred, and in the motor and cycle engineering section employment has been steady. In Yorkshire and the North of England there has been a slight improvement except in the area of the Tyne and Tees, where marine engineering has been adversely affected by the dispute in the North-East Coast shipyards. The position in general engineering in Lancashire has been quiet; increased unemployment has occurred in the textile engineering section, but in the motor engineering section there has been a steady improvement. The industry in Scotland has continued to be depressed. On the other hand, with the exception of certain districts, trade in South Wales has been fairly active.TEXTILES.Cotton. In Lancashire the situation in both the spinning and weaving sections, has continued quiet, with prospects of increased unemployment. In Yorkshire unemployment has again increased.
Hosiery, Woollen and Worsted. There has been a tendency towards a decline in the situation in the Midlands, which is, however, expected to be only temporary. In the West Riding of Yorkshire there are no signs of a definite improvement. Short-time working has continued in Scotland.Silk. Few signs of improvement have been manifest in the Midlands. At Coventry, however, the improvement in the manufacture of artificial silk has been maintained.Lace. Chard and Ilminster have again been busy. The improvement in the Midlands has, however, not been maintained. Trade in the curtain and plain net sections has been fair, but the levers&apos; section has shown some signs of decline. At Nottingham the situation has been only moderate.Jute. This industry has not yet recovered from the recent dispute.BUILDING.From all quarters of the country, except Scotland, reports have been received of increased activity ; in fact, the demand for skilled operatives has in some districts exceeded the supply.BOOT AND SHOE.At Norwich there has been a marked improvement. The working of intermittent short-time at Kingswood (Bristol) has continued, and no improvement is anticipated until after Whitsuntide. Trade has been good at most centres in the Midlands, especially at Derby.CLOTHING.Activity in the manufacture of men&apos;s clothing in the Home Counties has been curtailed, but dressmaking still affords opportunities for seasonal employment. In the South-Western Counties the improvement in the tailoring and dressmaking trades has continued. Manufacturers of wholesale clothing have also been busy at Kettering, Leicester and Wellingborough. There has been some improvement in the blouse and making-up trades at Basford, Nottingham.POTTERY AND GLASS.Signs of revival in the pottery and earthenware trades have been apparent in the Midlands, especially at Hanley, Burslem and Stoke-on-Trent. There has been a slump in the glass-bottle trade in both Yorkshire and Lancashire; on the other hand, the plate and sheet-glass1 industries have experienced a good spell of trade.TINPLATE.The activity previously reported in Wales has been maintained. TRANSPORT.Apart from a slight improvement at the Surrey Docks, the London Docks generally have continued slack. Of the Docks in the South-Western sector of the country, Southampton has been fairly busy, but the remainder have been inactive. On the North-East Coast there has been a gradual improvement in the situation, and the outlook at Liverpool is better. In Wales there has been an improvement at Barry, Newport and Swansea, but trade at Cardiff has remained slack.C. A. MONTAGUE BARLOW, Ministry of Labour.

SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN.[From Autumn 1920 onwards.]Cabinet Unemployment Committee.The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, the then Cabinet appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving&apos; unemployment. This Committee continued to function till October 1922. The present Government appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee on the 1st November, 1922.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, amalgamated the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extended until June 1923 the special periods during which benefit might be drawn.   The authority to borrow
money from the Treasury was increased to  30,000,000:-   By the Unemployment 0 *j Insurance Act, 1923, which came into operation en the 12th April, 1923,. the special periods for the payment of benefit have been extended to October- 1923.   Special provision has also been made by this Act for the following year to October 1924.Table- showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants),and the Contributions during the period from the 8th November, 1920, to the 28th April, 1923, 1.

Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 300,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 150,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work -provided for men in ancillary occupations and, the effect of the Export Credits Scheme&apos;.(C.) Extensions of Remedial Measures during the Winter 1922-23.Some of the measures comprised in (B) above are still in operation, e.g., past sanctions of grants by the Unemployed Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport. The Export Credits Scheme continues, and schemes approved under the Trade Facilities Act are in progress.In June 1922. the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport issued circular letters to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the relief of unemployment in their respective areas. Approved schemes are assisted by grants made on the same bases as heretofore. In the case of schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee, particulars of grants already sanctioned are set out below.In September 1922, the Ministry.of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circular letters to County Councils (except the London County Council) and Drainage Authorities, inviting them to submit schemes of land drainage which, if approved, might be assisted on fundamentally the same conditions as those applicable in the [9994] b 3
case of schemes assisted last year. All applications were to be received in the case of Drainage Authorities on or before December 1. 1922, and in the case of County Councils (Agricultural Committees) on or before December 16, 1922. County Councils were also circulated with regard to schemes for the supply of water to farms, the conditions of assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries remaining substantially the same as last winter, with the exception that the Ministry, instead of advancing the whole cost ot any scheme and recovering a proportion from the owners concerned, will make grants to cover part only of the total cost of each scheme. Further circulars, issued to County Councils and Drainage Authorities on the 5th and 6th December respectively, notified the extension of the date up to which applications might be received to the 13th January, 1923, ?md invited the submission of additional schemes. The time for receiving applications was further extended provisionally to the 10th February, 1923. Particulars of grants sanctioned and of the number of men employed to date are shown below (see table 6).On the 30th November, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, outlined the manner in which measures taken by the late Government would be continued and extended. The additional sums promised in extension of existing funds are set out below :  Unemployment Grants Committee (for grants on the basis of60 per cent, of Wages Bill) ... ...        ...        ...        600,000Land Drainage ...        ...        ...        ...        ...        170,000Afforestation ...        ...        ...        ... ...        ...        100,000Acceleration of Government contracts Office of Works......... 375,000General Post Office ... ... 946,000-     1,321,000It was also then announced that guarantees under the Trade Facilities Act Scheme would be made available up to  50,000,000 ( 25,000,000 extra); that the Export Credits Scheme would be extended if necessary; and that the Local Authorities concerned would be asked to co-operate in putting in hand the Manchester-Liverpool Road, which would involve an expenditure of about  3,000,000, half of it from the Road Fund.In December 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee issued a further circular letter to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes suitable for assistance on the basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill, i.e., works the cost of whieh is normally defrayed out of revenue and not by loan. The conditions under which grants may be sanctioned are substantially the same as those previously in force, except that in the case of Rural Districts the Committee have discretion to allow, where clearly necessary, a modification of the conditions regarding the giving of preference to 75 per cent, ex-service men and the engagement of labour through the Employment Exchanges.On the 12th December, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, further announced that, in addition to the acceleration of contracts by the Post Office and Office of Works, previously described, the Admiralty would accelerate miscellaneous works to a total of about  365,000; whilst the Home Office would put in hand certain accelerated building work, together with repairs to buildings, including Police Stations.On the 13th December, 1922, the Forestry Commission issued a press notice to the effect that forestry grants were available for the relief of unemployment on the same general conditions as those applicable to grants made last winter. The sum of  100,000 referred to above is to be used partly for this purpose a,nd partly for the purpose of relief schemes in Crown Forests and for additional work in the -Commission^ forests by the Trade Facilities and Loans Guarantee Act, 1922 (Session 2), enacted on the 15th December, 1922, formal sanction was given for the increase of the aggregate capital amount of loans the principal or interest of which mav be guaranteed under the Trade Facilities Act, 1921, from  25,000,000 to  50,000,000.On the 15th February, 1923, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, announced, an extension of  5,600,000 in the amount available for grants in respect of approved road, works by the Ministry of Transport.
