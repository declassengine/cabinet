To give,; instructions as to. the principles. -&quot;to be followed in valuing the Anglo-&apos; Scottish Railways - which* though drawn- on broad lines, would be sufficiently explicit to enable the Joint- Valuation,Authority and the Joint Appellate &apos; Tribunal&apos; to decide, without.reference.to previous jud icis 1 decisions, the severa 1&apos;questions in regard to which these decisions or the practices ,approved. in the,past in the respective . countries have differed.The. Committee accordingly recommend the Cabinet toauthorise the appointment by the Minister of Health, inconsultation   with the Secretary of State for Scotland andthe Parliamentary Secretary to the&apos; Ministry of Transport, ofa small expert- committee to examine the question, of the valuation of Railways and report- to the Minister of Health.3. The Committee have given careful consideration tothe Question of the Rating of machinery and in this connection the terms of a Private Members1 Bill which will come up for Second Reading on Friday, May 11th, have been examined.   This Bill aims generally at a definition of rateable machinery which will, secure uniformity of practice in England and Wales
and an assimilation of the law in England arid Wales to thelaw in Scotland.In Scotland since 1902 Statute low has excluded fromrating all plant,  and machinery in any building occupied forany trade, business or manufacturing process, which -,(a) can be removed without removing parts of the building; and(b) does not produce or transmit- first-motive cower, or form part of the heating or lighting&apos;plant0In England and Wales the practice depends in the main upon custom and case law, and though in the English &apos; Statute law there appears to be no specific provision to the effect, that machinery forms part of a rateable hereditament, it may be said that the genera 1 effect of&apos; the decisions of the Courts as to what is &quot;to be taken info account&quot; in arriving at the value of&quot;, a hexcdiwmcnt is that plant and machinery are to be included;, end that moveable chattels, or chattels which cannot be regarded as integral parts of the hereditament, are not?The effect of such-a. limitation on the rating of machinery as the Private Morebers f Bill proposes would.&apos; therefore undoubtedly be a considerable loss of rateable value to a large number of rating authorities in England and Wales,with serious results to their financial positions a,:d with d-consequent heaver increase of the rates falling to be borne&apos;: byhouseholder3 and other -ratepayers.-;    On the other hand the strength of tho arguments which can be &apos; adduced on equitable, and e.c on om I a grounds in favour of relieving the English manufacturer of part of his rating burdens Is such a3 to make it difficult for the Government, especially in the present condition of trade/ not to accept the view that some- limitation on the rating of
machinery is justified.If the principle of limiting the rating of machinery is conceded,, and if an assimilation of the law in England and Scotland is to be nought, there remains the question of devising a satisfactory definition which would secure uniformity of practice among rating authorities and, if practicable, a common baa in of Statute law for England and Wales.It seems clear that the definition proposed in the Private Members&apos; Bill would not achieve either of these objects.   The definition adopted in the Scottish Act of 1902 has not proved satisfactory and the Departmental Committee on Local Taxation in Scotland have stated that &quot;the task of finding a definition which would ensure reasonable uniformity of practice is only possible if a practical enquiry is instituted as to the various classes of machinery employed and the effect of the past decisions as applied to those cases&quot;.In view of the above considerations the Committee authorised the Minister of Health to make a statement on the Second Reading of the Private Members&apos; Bill to the effect that the Government are in sympathy with the general proposition that the rating of machinery should bo subject-to some limitation, but that, in view of the los-i of rateable, value to the local authorities which would be involved by any d la-rating of machinery, and. of the necessity for some precise definition for tho purpose of securing uniformity In practice, further inquiry-is necessary before effective legislation can be proceeded with, and that the Government have accordingly decided to appoint a Departmental Committee, including representatives of the local authorities, of the manufacturers, and rating experts, to obtain the necessary information and to prepare a definite scheme giving
effect to such a limitation of the rating of machinery they may find to be practicable.Signed on behalf pf the Committee.N.C.Chairman-Whitehall Gardens, May,  1923.
MODIFICATIONS   SUGGESTED   IN   THE   SCHEME ^ OF VALUATION. AND   RATING   REFORM.As Indicated in paragraph    of the Report, It is proposed that certain modifications should he made in the scheme to which -the draft Bill circulated to the Cabinet (CP. 27(23))was designed to give effect.     The more important of these modifications are asfollows; -1. In deference to the wishes&apos;of the Board of Inland Revenue lit is proposed that specific references in the Bill to the use of fvaluatlon lists for purposes of imperial taxation should be omitted land that a short clause should be inserted to the effect that gross lvalues as finally appearing In Valuation lists shall subsequently 1 be adopted for purposes of Income Tax, Inhabited House Duty,-&amp;c. at such time, in such manner and subject to such conditions as Parliament I shall hereafter determine (i,e. in a Finance Bill).Hating.2. The rating reliefs new enjoyed under the several statutory I provisions^applying to different classes of property vary greatly I between one urban area and another and between the rural parishesI Kith special rates and those without special rates, and It was foundII that the equation of those reliefs in urban and rural areas, Irespectively, which formed part of the rate consolidation scheme would I Involve some serious disturbances in the Incidence of local taxation. I In order to avoid thi   and to confine the Bill as far as possible to 1 administrative reforms it is now proposed -fj        (a) That, Instead of applying a uniform scale of equated relief to the General Rate in all the urban areas, a separate scale based on the actual reliefs previously enjoyed over a period&apos; of years should be worked out for each urban area,Xb) That the special rates in respect of sanitary and lighting&apos; I expenses in rural parishes should, remain untouched, a GeneralRate for all other purposes being made in each rural district.3. This amendment has accentuated the need for a modificationI of the proposed precepting reform.     In urban areas, if no adjustmentI were made, precepts would be levied on a reduced basis while inI rural areas they would continue t-o be levied on the present basis.I &apos; -1-
,- 2 0 0It ia accordingly proposed to adjust the urban precepting basis In such manner that the reform will involve no change in the incidence of local taxation but will simply remove the inequity of charging rating areas in respect of their unproductive values.Valuation.4* Valuation areas.   Some divergence of opinion undoubtedly exists on the question of valuation areas.     There would appear to be a strong body of opinion in favour of making the new areas conform as far as possible with existing Union areas,.    Modifications are accordingly proposed which would make this possible In a greater number of cases, by empowering County Councils to agree upon joint schemes for dealing with unions in more than one county and enabling any valuation area comprising a County Borough to include portions of any existing union outside the Borough.5* Constitution ofiAssessment Committees.   There is also some divergence of view on this question, but it is hoped that the following proposals will command a general measure of agreement:-(a) County Boroughs - Assessment Committees to&apos;be appointedby the County Borough Council, but not less than \ of the members of the Committee to be nominees of the Boards of Guardians concernedj(b) County Districts - Schemes constituting AssessmentCommittees (prepared by County Councils and approved by the Minister of Heaith) to provide for representa-tion of the. County Council and Boards of Guardians as well as the District Councils concerned;   the numbers of representatives of each authority to be determined by the scheme, account being taken of rateable values, the amount of rates raised for the purposes of the various constituent authorities and population.6* County Valuation Committees.   It is proposed to empowerOountv Councils to appoint County.Valuation Committees who wouldselect and keep in touch with the County Council representatives on Assessment Committees and otherwise assist In securinguniformity of valuation.     The County Valuation Committee wouldnot itself determine assessments, except in cases where the
County Council was called upon to act in default of an Assessment Committee which, had failed in the performance of its duties. .7.   Appeals.    In accordance with suggestions made by several of the Associations consulted, provisions are proposed to enable appeals against decisions of Assessment Committees to be settled,by Arbitration in lieu of Quarter Sessions where the Court and.all the parties agree,8,   Special Properties.     Certain alterations are pro-posed in the provisions relating to special properties.     In particular power has been given to the Central Valuation Authority, within the limits of general directions to be laid down by the Minister of Health, to arrange that particular special properties shall be valued locally.The result of discussion of the scheme with representa-tives of the Mining Association was to suggest that the proposal for the valuation of mines and quarries by one Central Valuation Authority might not command general support.     It is therefore proposed, to omit mines and quarries from the list of special properties enumerated in the draft Bill vhich would, then be confined to undertakings of a public utility character.Some special provisions will be necessary in Connection with the Valuation of Railways, and. particularly the Anglo-Scottish groups.9*   Central Valuation Authority,   In view of the importance of the duties of the proposed Central Valuation Authority and the desirability of securing continuity of practice in the assessment of special properties it is suggested that provision should be made for the appointment of a Chairman of judicial experience, his remuneration to be prescribed in the Bill and provided out of local rates as part of the expenses of the Central Valuation Authority.
10.   Maintenance Deductions.   As In the case of the .&apos;.       2f) proposals for consolidation of rates, further examination has revealed difficulties which would be involved in an attempt to prescribe a national scale of deductions except in the case of certain properties, (e.g. dwelling-houses) where the more difficult problems of valuation do not arise.     It is therefore proposed to provide for a prescribed scale of de-reductions in respect only of specified classes of hereditament, leaving deductions in respect of other classes to be determined having regard to the customary abatements of the past and the desirability of attaining uniformity.     In order, however, to secure as large a measure of uniformity as possible it is proposed to empovrer County Valuation Committees and Assessment Committees to combine for the purpose of prescribing local scales of deductions in respect of particular classes of hereditament not covered by the general scale, and to give statutory force to scales so prescribed.
