CABINET.REDUCTION OF NATIONAL EXPENDITURE.Sub-Committee on Staffs of Admiralty Office, War Office and Air Ministry.Composition and Terms of Reference,WITH the approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Churchill&apos;s Committee of the Cabinet appointed to examine the Estimates of the Fighting Services for 1923/24 has appointed a Sub-Committee to enquire into the establishments of the Admiralty Office, War Office and Air Ministry and into the establishments of the staffs of the three Services with, a view to effecting reductions.Composition of the Sub-Committee.Chairman: The Right Hon. Lord Weir. Members:Lieutenant-General Sir Herbert Miles, G.C.B., G.C.M.G, G.B.E., C.V.O. Sir R. R. Scott, K.C.B., C.S.I., Controller of Establishments, Treasury. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir J. R. Chancellor, G.C.M.G., D.S.O., Committee of Imperial Defence.Joint Secretaries:Lieutenant-Colonel C. W. G. Walker, D.S.O., Assistant Secretary, Committeeof Imperial Defence. Mr. R. A. Grieve, O.B.E., Treasury. ^Terms of Reference.To make recommendations for effecting reductions in (a.) The establishments of the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry; (b.) The establishments of the higher staffs of the three Services; (c.) The staffs of the Dockyards, Factories, Technical and other establishments controlled by the-three Services;having regard -Firstly, to the comparative sizes of staffs now and before the war;Secondly, to the relation between the staffs and the effective national defencevalue of their work; Thirdly, to the ranks^ of the officers employed now and pre-war on the same or equivalent duties;Fourthly, to the ranks of officers employed now and the relative ranks of officers performing similar duties in France and America; and finally, to the pay attached to the performance of similar duties in the three countries, bearing in mind the local purchasing power of money in each case.Reasonable latitude will be extended to the Committee to indicate how variations in policy would effect economies.
REPORT.PART II.-WAR OFFICE AND MILITARY ESTABLISHMENTS. Preliminary Remarks.AS we anticipated, a number of the generalisations which we made in Part I of our Eeport on the Admiralty we find to apply equally to the War Office and Army establishments; and we hope that the disadvantages of repeating these observations may be counterbalanced by the convenience of having separate reports on the three Services, and by the advantage of submitting each report as soon as it is completed.We regret it has not been possible to obtain the essential data to enable us to apply the tests as to the relative conditions prevailing in France and the United States. Such enquiries as we have made in regard to emoluments of staffs suggest that it may in fact be impossible to discover any proper basis of comparison. In the case of the United States, for example, it is difficult to estimate the comparative cost of living, while in France we are faced not merely with the difficulty of assessing the internal value of the franc, but also with the problem of equating the conditions which differentiate a voluntary from a conscript army.2. We are asked to have regard in the first place to the comparative size of the staffs now and before the war. We have accordingly taken as a basis for our enquiry the Army Estimates for 1914/15 as compared with those for 1923/24; but we would remark that, owing to the many qualifications that are involved in presenting an absolutely exact picture, we have made no attempt to attain meticulous accuracy in the figures quoted. Moreover, as the form of presentation of Army Estimates has changed entirely since 1914, it is now impossible to institute comparisons by Heads of Expenditure. Subject to these qualifications, we give below comparative figures for the Headquarter and certain other establishments of the War Office : 	1914/15.				1923/24.

A saving of 50 per cent, on the War Office staff would only reduce the Army Estimates by 1 per cent.* Includes Local Audit Offices.   The numbers and cost for 1923/24 refer to the 1st April, 1923; but provision is made for a reduction of staff to the extent of  42,000 during 1923/24. t The number of these establishments is twice the pre-war number.J These depots iwo in 1914 and four to-day-are reserved exclusively for ammunition and small-arms. 5 These depots keep stores of every description, including gun parts, &amp;c. II Including bakeries.[9701J b 2
Although we are fully aware that real economy in a national service can only be secured by the closest scrutiny of even the smallest items of expenditure, we desire to make it clear that an investigation that is confined to the staffs alone cannot yield substantial savings.- Large savings can in our view only be found as a result of a general review of army policy. Although our terms of reference allow us to make suggestions dealing with the effect of policy upon the size and cost of staffs, for obvious reasons we have not attempted to review army policy as a whole. Our suggestions in regard to policy are confined to matters which have.come prominently before us in considering the problems of staff.3. In the second place, we have been asked to have regard to the relation between the staffs and the effective national defence value of their work. We assume that this means that we are to consider or correlate in some way the expenditure on staffs now and before the war with the comparative effective strength of the Army at the two dates. The development and improvement in weapons, together with the vast experience gained in the Great War has of course increased the effectiveness and absolute offensive power of the Army. On the other hand we must assume that similar developments have taken place in the armies of potential enemies. Accordingly we can best suggest that comparative power relative to other armies can only be measured by the numbers of officers and men. The comparisons with 191.4 are as follows for the different branches of the Army: Establishment of British Troops.	19H/15.f			1923/24.			- Percentage Increase or Decrease, all Ranks.	Officers.

4. In dealing with numbers of the staff we wish to make it clear at the outset that it is beyond the competence of a Committee such as ours to determine whether every member of the staff is usefully and properly employed. The great bulk of the work done is of a nature that cannot be definitely measured; and the numbers requisite to perform the work can only be determined by the closest supervision by the individual immediately in charge of each section of the work of each of his subordinates.5. Reductions in establishments and staffs, if economy is to be effected without loss of efficiency, are only obtainable by certain methods. Putting aside the question of grading and individual efficiency, these may be summarised as follows : (a.) Reduction of the amount of work to be performed.(b.) More efficient methods, better organisation, or improved processes.(c.) Longer working hours for the same pay.(d.) Reductions in pay.6. Taking these factors in inverse order, we understand that, so far as the civil side of the War Office is concerned, the rates and scales of salary now prescribed have been fixed as far as possible in accordance with general Civil Service standards, and that these rates and scales are subject to modification every six months in accordance with the trend of the cost of living as measured by the monthly index figures. *The revised rates of pay of Army officers and other ranks were fixed on a post-war basis in 1919, and are not subject, as are civil rates of pay, to adjustment at short intervals in accordance with changes in the cost of living. It was decided, when the revised rates were fixed, that 20 per cent, of the revised rates of officers should be considered as due to the high cost of living, and should be subject after five years (i.e.. in 1924) to change either upwards or downwards, according as the cost of living had risen or fallen in the intervening period, and that there should be revision thereafter every three years up or down on the basis of the official food prices index number. As regards other ranks, no provision was made for review of any kind.7. We observe that our reference does not call upon us to enquire into or make recommendations on the subject of rates of pay; nor, indeed, do we consider that it would be profitable to undertake such an enquiry except as part of a general investigation, on the one hand, into the standard of remuneration and working conditions prevailing in civil Departments of Government, and, on the other, into the rates of remuneration fixed for the Fighting Services as a whole.At the same time, we have been impressed throughout our investigation by the important bearing of pay and remuneration generally on the cost of the Service Departments.The following table gives the increases and decreases of expenditure under the various Vote headings and shows how the expenditure estimated for 1923/24 would appear in comparison with that of 1914/15 reduced by 12 per cent. (i.e., to the extent of the reduction made in Regimental Establishments for next financial year as compared with 1914/15). While the figures in this table are fairly comparable as between the two years, it is almost impossible to disentangle the items for remunera-tion from the Army Estimates on the same lines as was possible in the case of the Navy Estimates.* During the last two years the pay of Civil Servants as a whole has been reduced under theoperation of this soheme to the extent of Js20 millions a year.

An analysis of Army expenditure discloses the outstanding importance of pay as a field for economy. For example, 1 per cent, of Vote 1 represents the sum of  164,000 per annum.Taking the War Office as a whole we find that there were at the beginning of the year 91 military officers and 45 civilian officers in receipt of remuneration exceeding  1,000 a year. In those branches of the War Office where the Administrative and Directing Staff is civilian, we find that the ratio of staff over  1,000 a year to staff under  1,000 a year (excluding messengers and cleaners) is 1 to 34, whereas in the branches of the War Office where the Administrative and Directing Staff consists of military officers, the ratio is 1 to 12, excluding the Medals Branch, and 1 to 16 including the Medals Branch. It must, however, be remembered in connection with this comparison that the Secretary&apos;s Department, in which a staff of 456 is employed, is to some extent a general service department for the War Office as a whole. Before the war there were 44 civilians on the War Office establishment with salaries in excess of  750 a year as compared with 45 civilians to-day on salaries, inclusive of bonus, in excess of  1,000 a year, and 66 military officers with remuneration in excess of  750 a year as compared with 91 at the beginning of this year receiving-remuneration in excess of  1,000 a year.The average total emoluments of all military officers employed in the. War Office at the present time is  1,065.9. With such figures before us, we should be failing in our duty if we omitted to draw particular attention to the subject of pay; and we feel fully justified in emphasising the recommendation of the Geddes Committee on this subject in*  500,000 for aviation has been omitted.
Part XVIII of their Report.* We understand that since that Committee reported in February last, no substantial change has taken place in the remuneration of public servants apart from a reduction of roughly one-third of the Civil Service bonus still remaining at that date, a 2\ per cent, reduction in the pay of the Police and a 5 per cent, contribution towards Teachers&apos; superannuation.10. In dealing with this problem of pay and remuneration of public servants, it must not be forgotten that in the case of industries exposed to the full play of foreign competition large sections of the population have already made sacrifices, and are undergoing a certain measure of hardship through accepting reductions of wages. Their action has enabled the cost of production of some of the exports, by which the nation exists, to be lowered, and unemployment has thereby been substantially alleviated. In other industries, sheltered from the full play of economic forces, the inevitable readjustment has not yet been made, and grave inconsistencies are disclosed if the rates of remuneration in the various trades are compared. These inconsistencies tend to maintain the &quot; cost of living &quot; index figure at its present high level, and to restrict the purchasing power of the lowly-paid sections of the population. A general readjustment of the scale of remuneration embracing all sections of the community would react favourably upon the financial and industrial position of the nation.It is for these reasons that we consider the pay of the Fighting Services and also the pay of the Civil Service should be closely reviewed in relation to the scales of remuneration of the rest of the nation by a strong and authoritative Committee, t appointed by the Cabinet. Without attempting to prejudge the results of such an enquiry, we suggest that, in view of the changes in economic circumstances which have taken place even during the last twelve months, the case for undertaking such an enquiry, however strong it might have been at the date of the Geddes Committee&apos;s Report, is now imperative.That enquiry, as the Geddes Committee pointed out, would have to take into account percentage increases over pre-war rates and the relation of the pay and conditions of service of each grade to its corresponding grade in the public services and in civil life; existing contractual obligations and the possibility of introducing new rates and conditions of service for new entrants; and the extent to which provision exists and has already operated for reducing rates of remuneration in accordance with the reduced cost of living.11. In regard to hours, the evidence shows that there has been no substantial change in the official working hours at the War Office since 1914; but there has been some reduction of overtime in many Departments. Although we are of opinion that systematic working of overtime should not be sanctioned, we see no objection to a reasonable amount of overtime on work of an emergency character; and in settling* The recommendations of the G-eddes Committee are summarised in paragraph 14 of Part XVIII of their Report, which runs as follows:  &quot; 14. We have pointed out how the pay of the Fighting Services, Teachers and Police was fixed in 1919 under quite abnormal circumstances, and, on a general survey, we feel that the country cannot continue to support a burden of this magnitude.&quot; We recognise the complexity of the question and the difficulties in dealing with it, some of whioh we have referred to. We feel, however, that the subject is so far-reaching that it calls for a thorough special investigation.&quot; Such an investigation would necessarily have to cover not only the percentage increase, but also the relation of the pay and conditions of service of each grade to its corresponding grade in the public service and in civil life. It would also have to take in account the contractual obligations existing and the possibilities of introducing new rates of pay and conditions of service for new entrants, also &quot;whether provision exists and has already operated to meet the reduced cost of living.&quot; We would also draw attention to the fact that in certain cases, e.g., Government offices in London, the lower grade staff paid on an overtime basis has a normal day from 10 to 5 with an interval for lunch and half-day on Saturday. This is a shorter day than obtains in outside employment, and might well be reviewed at the same time.&quot; Such an important and far-reaching enquiry is manifestly beyond the scope which was ever intended for this Committee, touching as it might the very varying conditions of life of 1J millions of employees and their families. Indeed, it is far beyond the time at our disposal to hold such an enquiry, and we have therefore refrained from making a recommendation, arrived at after inadequate investigation, and have contented ourselves with urging that the most expeditious and authoritative means available should be adopted for a thorough review of this important question.&quot;tWe are gratified to note since our Report on the Admiralty was submitted that a strong and authoritative Committee have now been appointed by the Government as recommended.

the size of staffs this factor should be taken into account. Rigid enforcement of rules for the prevention of overtime entails the provision of a staff based upon emergency conditions, and therefore in excess of normal requirements. We understand that proposals are now under consideration for the extension of the working hours of those classes of Civil Servants who are employed on a basis of less than an eight-hours&apos; working day.12. We are strongly of opinion that, as regards working hours, overtime and holiday leave, the conditions in Government Departments should be reviewed in relation to the conditions prevailing in civil life. While it is essential that the Government as an employer should maintain,such conditions of employment as will be above reproach, it must be obvious that to&apos;raise the standard of conditions above that obtaining in private employment of a similar class will render the maintenance of that standard difficult, since its basis is unsound and insecure. It is not by the creation of artificial standards that the Government will obtain for itself the character of a model employer. We recommend that these matters should be fully considered by whatever authority may be set up to deal with pay and remuneration.13. With the foregoing considerations in view, it is obvious that the practical recommendations of a Committee such as ours must be largely confined to suggesting economies in numbers of staffs through the elimination of work and improvements in organisation and method.14. To enable us to6assess in close detail the size of staffs necessary for the manifold and varied activities carried on in the various Departments of a great organisation like the War Office, and to determine whether or not each individual is usefully and profitably employed, it would be necessary for us to make a detailed study of each section of each Department of the War Office, a, task which is beyond our power in the limited time at our disposal. Throughout the whole of our investigations we have kept in mind the relatively small field of expenditure we have under review compared with the total annual estimates of the Fighting Services, and the caution necessary in dealing with such a highly complex machine as the War Office, developed hy years of experience to deal with most complicated problems and responsibilities. Recommendations conceived in an arbitrary or doctrinaire spirit might easily cause heavy increase in expenditure or losses in other directions. The ultimate safeguard of the nation in regard to economy in staff must always depend upon the realisation by the Heads of the Departments, Divisions and Sections of their responsibility for economical administration. That obligation cannot be too strongly impressed upon everyone concerned in the administration of their Depart-ments by Ministers and their chief assistants.15. As a Committee we can only indicate salient characteristics which strike us in regard to practice and policy, and if as regards the latter we appear to encroach occasionally upon the field of the expert, we do so by assuming that our position is analogous-to that of a committee of shareholders enquiring into the affairs of their company. In private and business life at no time has it been more essential than now that coats should be cut according to the available cloth. In private enterprise, neglect of this fundamental consideration speedily leads to bankruptcy, and no employer in regulating his business can afford to disregard the facts disclosed by his annual profit and loss account.The absence of such an account in Government business makes it the more neces-sary to subject both policy and methods to the test of constant and searching enquiry and criticism.16. We now proceed to deal with some of the main causes for the increases in staff which have been disclosed by our investigations. Some of these can best be dealt with when considering the individual departments, as we do later in detail, but the following generalisations affect practically all departments : -(a) The influence of war aftermath.(&amp;.) The influence of changes in administration and executive methods and processes.(c.) The influence.of changes in warfare and in army policy. (d.) The influence of the changed character of the international political situa-tion in general.Our investigation also shows that a considerable proportion of the increases of staff are directly due to the carrying out of work connected with the clearing-up and
settlement of the aftermath of the war. .We do not deal with these increases in any-great detail, nor do we make any suggestions for handling this work more efficiently, for we learned that it is the subject of close and constant consideration by the Heads of Departments. At the present time 300 persons are wholly employed in the War Office on aftermath work.17. We are aware of a belief In some quarters that the staffs are swollen, as a result of individual slacking of effort and of reduction of individual output, and that staff has been created without the existence of corresponding work to be done. We may say at once that we have found no evidence to sustain that belief, and no indication of the&apos; existence of deliberate slacking or of lack of work for the staffs. We have heard evidence of inefficiency and of low output from certain sections of the staffs as compared with pre-war days evidence of a nature which finds its parallel in private life and is not confined to Government staffs. It is impossible to ignore the fact that the general influence of the war has been temporarily to reduce individual application and energy. In 1914 the conditions in the Departments had been normal for a long period. Individuals had been trained for their work; they knew their work, and routine played a large part. To-day in some departments sections of the staffs are new to their work. They include a number of ex-service men and in some cases of men with disabilities, and men ill-trained for their work. As a result of the evidence, it may be said that in certain sections, particularly of the subordinate staffs, the output per man is less than in 1914.18. We do not wish, however, unduly to emphasise the importance of the fore-going considerations. Greater importance must be attached to the fact that the most ordinary clerical or other transaction to-day is more complicated and involves a greater expenditure of effort than in 1914.Such complication is due to new policy, new legislation, and new regulations. There is also a subsidiary factor which is of importance. In pre-war days decisions on routine matters affecting a soldier or a pensioner or an ex-service man were, as a rule, accepted without question. To-day decisions are disputed and explanations are asked for, which result in much more correspondence with the individuals con-cerned than in 1914. This is partly due to&apos; the fact that new laws have been passed and new regulations framed, with the result that a superannuation allowance or pension can now only be awarded after a complicated series of calculations which are difficult for the recipient to understand.Towards the elimination of these causes of extra work we regret our inability to make definite recommendations. Some of them are the inevitable outcome of the war; others are due to the more democratic and exacting spirit of the times. Time will simplify and eliminate some, while others will in all probability remain. -Briefly, staffs have increased owing to the increased complexity of the work and also on account of lower individual output in certain sections of the staffs.19. After making all allowances for changes in administration and executive requirements, for lower individual output and for aftermath services, we have been forced to the conclusion that a substantial part of the increase/ of staffs is due to the development of material and to changes in the methods of warfare. In truth, the Departments are dealing to-day with a different army from that of 1914.20. Measured in terms of the total establishment of officers and men, the Army to-day is weaker than the Army of 1914, but measured in terms of strength of material and equipment, and scope and opportunity for training and education to-day&apos;s Army is incomparably more effective than our pre-war Army. The great fields where development and improvement have taken place are as follows : (a.) Artillery. (b.) Machine-guns, (c.) Tanks. (d.) Signals.(e.) Mechanical transport.(/.) Additional educational and training establishment and facilities. (g.) War reserves of material and equipment.21. As a result of the war every artillery battery is now equipped with later and more highly developed weapons, equipment and ammunition, while many new classes of ordnance, such as howitzers of large calibre, long-range guns and trench artillery, are now available for use in warfare.[9701] c
Iii 1914 the establishment of machine guns per battalion was two. To-day it is eight Vickers and thirty-four Lewis guns. Tanks did not exist in 1914. Now there is a Tank Corps with a home establishment of four battalions and two armoured car companies, with training establishments and facilities.In 1914 mechanical transport for military purposes was in its infancy. To-day army transport as a whole has become substantially mechanicalised. As a result of the development of new weapons, corps and services, additional training establish-ments are required, while new educational opportunities and facilities are also available for officers and men. Further, the war has left the Army with an enormous inheritance of war material which in a large measure has now been established as a war reserve.22. In addition to the provision of new weapons and equipment there is a concen-tration of expenditure and scientific effort on the design of war material. This policy is not confined to purely experimental work, but extends in a certain degree to original scientific research. In every field of engineering science as applied to war-fare, energy and thought are being expended in the many Army establishments. The increased application of scientific discoveries to war material results in increased complexity and entails increased staffs in practically every Department, for these complexities do not simply affect the technical staffs, but extend throughout the whole organisation of the Army.23. Generally, we conclude that one of the main reasons for the increased staffs is the direct and natural result of changes in the methods of warfare characterised by enhanced complexity of weapons and the more intense concentration on the scientific development of new weapons and methods of warfare.24. In addition to the many and varied causes which, as we have shown, con-tribute to the increase of staffs, there is a further consideration which affects all the fighting services. - So long as there is unrest in India, Egypt and the mandated terri-tories, and so long as international complications such as have recently arisen in the Near East and on the Ehine are hanging over us, the efficient and economical reorganisation and reconstitution of our fighting forces and their establishments on a peace basis is impossible. The menace of war definitely makes for additional expense and is destructive of economy.The demobilization problem of the War Office after the Great War differed essentially from that of the Admiralty. Our naval strength during the war measured in terms of personnel increased from that of 1914 by 180 per cent., while the Army personnel increased by 2,000 per cent. The Navy has been reduced under the influence of two fairly definite decisions in regard to policy the declaration of the one-Power standard, and the Washington Agreement.The War Office on the other hand have been instructed to provide as in pre-war days for the maintenance of the Army on the Cardwell system, and for the rapid mobilization and equipment of a specific number of expeditionary force divisions. In carrying out these instructions the&apos; War Office are faced with the difficult problem of how to organize and create this new Army on lines of efficiency and to embody in our army system, the lessons of the war. At no time in our history have more difficult problems had to be faced than those which confront the Army Council to-day.Nothing will do more to bring about economy in War Office staff than definite decisions on the reorganisation of the Army.25. It is with all these varied considerations before us that we approach the detailed problems involved in our task. We possess a full and sympathetic apprecia-tion of the difficult position of the members of the Army Council, who on one hand must have regard to the supreme necessity for national economy, and on the other hand must realize the grave responsibilities laid upon them for the efficiency of the British Army. But we recommend that it should be impressed upon all holding positions of responsibility that, in the interests of economy, it is their imperative duty to exercise unceasing vigilance and to subject every item of expenditure to the closest scrutiny with a view to cutting off everything that is not necessary, while in matters of policy a due sense of proportion should be observed in order that the most effective defence insurance for the nation may be obtained for the money expended.Army Administration. 26. In  the  case  of  the  Navy  we  found  it  possible .to  make  definite recommendations for reduction in staff numbers without affecting the fundamental
organization of the Admiralty or the Navy, and without modifying any important factors in Admiralty policy. In the case of the Army, however, a careful review of our evidence has brought us to the broad conclusion that any detailed recom-mendations we might make for reduction in staffs employed under the existing organization would be of little value. For the post-war British Army on a peace-time basis is only now in course of creation : its establishments are still undetermined; and there is a necessity for the exercise of imagination and for prompt decisions by the Army Council in regard to a large number of difficult problems. We believe that economy and efficiency can only be achieved by changes in organization of a far-reaching nature, and our evidence goes to show that such changes are regarded by j he Army Council as urgent and essential.27. The objective of the organization and administration of an army is war; and in the case of the British Army, war under a variety of strategic and geographical conditions unknown to the armies of other Powers. In peace the primary considerations of the organization of the British Army are the provision of garrisons for our oversea possessions, the education and training of the troops for war, the organization of the Army into suitable formations of all arms and the preparation of plans for a rapid mobilization.28. The factor which differentiates a peace from a war organisation is the factor of finance. In war the importance of economical administration is not diminished, but its control becomes more difficult, and financial considerations must^ give way to the supreme necessity of winning the war. In peace, finance assumes a foremost position, and hence the administration of the army becomes paramount in importance. Peace administration should be directed to ensure that the money is spent with the utmost economy. Further, our peace organisation should provide an administrative staff trained for the duties that will fall to it in war, so that not only economy in finance, which is important, but economy in military administration, which is more important still, may result.The two great functions which govern the work and performance of an army are command and administration; and the difficult problems connected with either a peace or war organisation are fundamentally associated with the relations and definition of responsibility of those who exercise these two essential functions.Command thinks out and plans the strategic operations; administration, through its control of the specialised services, provides for the operations to be carried out. As operations and the orders associated with their successful execution depend on the practicability of these operations from an administrative point of view, the intimate co-operation of c ommand and administration is essential for success. If the plan be produced and simply given to the administrative branches to carry out without previous consultation, friction certainly, and failure probably, will result. In war it is obvious that command must be the dominating factor; but in peace the functions of command have in some measure to yield to the needs of the administrative branches, upon which rest financial responsibility.Organization of the Staff.29. The Esher Committee recognised the need for relieving military Commanders as far as practicable from preoccupation as to questions of finance and adminis-tration in order that they might devote their energies to the duties of command, education and training. In accordance with their recommendation, the General Staff was created to deal solely with these matters; and a General Officer in charge of Administration was appointed to the staff of each General Officer Commanding-in-Chief to co-ordinate the duties of the Adjutant-GeneraTs and Quartermaster-GeneraTs staffs in the Command.But it is at the same time laid down that the General Officer-in-Charge of. Administration is responsible to the Army Council for seeing that the money voted by Parliament is properly expended and that the authorised expenditure is not ueliberately exceeded. He deals direct with the local heads of the services and departments, and the Quartermaster-general&apos;s staff do not act as intermediaries between the General Officer-in-Charge of Administration and the heads of services and departments.The position of the General Officer-in-Charge of Administration is thus anomalous, for, although he is appointed to the staff of the General Officer I9701! 0 2
Commanding-in-Chief, he is not a staff officer in the ordinary meaning of the term; for lie is definitely charged with responsibility to the Army Council for the proper expenditure of the money voted by Parliament, and is thus as regards administration invested with the attributes of command, which are incompatible with his status of staff officer to the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief.The General Officer-in-Charge of Administration is entrusted with the control of the administrative services and departments, exercising his authority by order of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, who delegates to him such powers as will enable him to deal with all administrative matters which do not involve questions of policy or principle. The General Officer-in-Charge of Administration, who exercises the financial powers given by regulation to the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, may at his discretion delegate his financial authority to his adihinistrative subordinates,&apos; but he is not thereby relieved of ultimate financial responsibility.30. The war brought to light certain defects in the organisation of the staff. A result of the arrangement under which the heads of the administrative services and departments dealt directly with the General Officer-in-Charge of Administration, and not through his staff officers, was that the duties of the officers of the Quartermaster-GeneraFs staff in time of peace became almost nominal, and those officers had little opportunity in peace of learning the duties that they would be called upon to discharge in war. The want of suitable officers for the Quartermaster-General&apos;s staff trained in co-ordinating the work of the administrative services was therefore acutely felt at the beginning of the War.The existing system in effect unduly separates command from administration; and the principle of separation of functions has been extended to the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, who is regarded as primarily concerned with general staff functions and as only indirectly responsible for the administration of his command.In an army such as ours, recruited on a voluntary basis and serving in every quarter of the globe, administrative considerations exercise so predominating an influence, that it is in practice impossible for a General Officer Commanding to be relieved of responsibility for administration in peace, nor, indeed, can he be relieved of such responsibility in war.31. We have heard evidence to the effect that, as the result of the experience of the War, a change in the organization of the staff of an army in the field is contem-plated by the Army Council. The principle embodied in the new organization is that there shall be three principal staff officers on the headquarters staff of an army in the field, viz., the Chief of the General Staff, the Adjutant-General and the Quarter-master-General. The administrative services will be brought under the control of the Quartermaster-General&apos;s staff. The heads of the administrative services will normally be charged with financial responsibility for the services administered by them, and, unless he deliberately assumes it by overriding the advice tendered to him by&apos;their heads, the Commander-in-Chief will have no direct financial responsibility for the administration of those services.32. This involves a change from the arrangement contemplated by the Field Service Regulations of the pre-war period under which the Inspector-General of Communications superintended and co-ordinated the work on the lines of communication of all the administrative services and assumed financial responsibility except where the Commander-in-Chief specifically relieved him of it. We agree that the Director of each administrative department may properly be called upon to assume financial responsibility for the working of his own service; but it appears to us that, if the post of Inspector-General of Communications is abolished, the function of correlating and exercising general control over the requirements of the administrative services must naturally and inevitably fall to the Commander-in-Chief, acting by and with the advice and assistance of the Quartermaster-General, who, as a Staff Officer, cannot assume prime responsibility in his own person.It would be impossible, in practice, as in our view it would be undesirable in principle, to divorce administrative responsibility for the co-ordination of the services from financial responsibility for their economical administration. The new staff organisation therefore unavoidably involves a substantial addition to the financial responsibilities of the Commander-in-Chief in war. That these responsibilities must ultimately fall upon the Commander-in-Chief is, however, inevitable. We do not apprehend that he will be unduly burdened by them, for he can relieve himself
34. In this connection we desire to refer to the relations of the staff to the administrative services. Formerly the relationship of the staff to the administrative services was similar to that of the staff to subordinate commanders. The heads of departments were then, more or less, in the position of commanding officers; and instructions were issued to them through the staff in the same way as orders were issued to subordinate commanders. In 1888 when changes in the organization of adminis-trative services of the army were introduced, the Supply and Transport, Equipment and Ordnance Departments became branches of the Quartermaster-GeneraFs staff. Similarly, the Medical Service, which was formerly quite separate, is now shown as part of the Adjutant-General&apos;s staff.These changes have resulted in confusion of thought as to the position and functions of Staff Officers; and we think they have in some measure conduced to the large increase in the number of Staff Officers, which has been a marked feature of army organization of recent years.35. By regulation the duty of the staff is to assist their Commander in the execution of the duties entrusted to him, to transmit his orders and instructions to subordinate commanders and to the services, to make the necessary arrangements connected therewith, and to see that those orders and instructions are carried out. i t is also the duty of the staff to give to the troops and. services every assistance in their power in the execution of their tasks.Staff Officers, as such, are vested with no military command. Apart from their General they have no authority; although charged with the issue of orders every order is given by the authority and on the responsibility of their Commander. The position of a staff officer thus differs fundamentally from that of a commander or head of an administrative service. As the heads of the services are executive officers, and are definitely responsible for the services they administer, they are not staff officers.We recommend that in order to establish a clear definition of functions, which is essential for efficient and economical administration, the heads of the administrative services and departments should have the status of commanding officers of their departments and should cease to function as if they were, in addition, on the staff of the General.In order to emphasise the distinction between the staff and the services we suggest that in the Army List the staff should be shown together and the administra-tive services apart from them.by extensive delegation of his responsibilities to the heads of the administrative departments.33. We consider it highly desirable that the staff organization in peace should conform to that prescribed for war. We recommend accordingly that the post of Major-General-in-Charge of Administration in the Commands should be abolished. As stated above, in war, provision will be made at General Headquarters for three principal Staff Officers, whilst in subordinate Commands the same principle will apply, although the staff functions of the Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General will be combined in one officer. We recommend that the organization of Commands in peace should correspond to the organization proposed for war, and that the officer combining the functions of Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General should be responsible to the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief for the co-ordination of the administrative services whose heads should be financially responsible for the administration of their respective departments.This arrangement would make for economy and efficiency alike, for it would (1.) Remove the present anomaly of the dual status of the General Officer-in-Charge of Administration. (2.) Result in the replacement of the Major-General-in-Charge of Administra-tion by a Staff Officer combining the functions of the Adjutant-General&apos;sand Quartermaster-General&apos;s. Staff. (3.) Afford officers of the Adjutant-General&apos;s and Quartermaster-General&apos;sstaffs experience in peace of the duties that would devolve upon themin war.(4.) Maintain the important principle of delegation of financial responsibilityfrom the Commander-in-Chief. (5.) Ensure the co-ordination of the administrative services.
36. In view of what has been said above, it is necessary that General Staff Officers should have an intelligent working knowledge of administration. No plan they produce can be carried out unless it is practicable from the administrative point of view.We are not satisfied that this aspect of administration has received from the General Staff the attention it deserves. A knowledge of administration can only be acquired in the junior ranks, and we recommend that all staff officers should be employed for a time in the junior grades of the administrative staff.It is at the same time essential that the separation of functions that has been effected by assigning command, education and training to the General Staff and administration to the Adjutant-General&apos;s and Quartermaster-General&apos;s staffs should be rigidly adhered to in order to avoid the danger, which past experience has shown to be a real one, of the General Staff Officers immersing themselves in the duties of administration to the detriment of the performance of their proper duties.From the evidence we have heard there seems to be a danger of this principle of definition of functions being lost sight of in connection with the administration of the training and educational establishments some of which are, we are informed, administered by the General Staff.The duty of the General Staff in regard to those establishments is to lay down the guiding policy, to prescribe the syllabuses of instruction and to conduct the examinations; but responsibility for their administration should rest with the Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General within their respective spheres, and the&apos; Army Council should take steps to ensure that these responsibilities are emphasised and discharged.In conclusion we desire to lay emphasis on the fact that although the work of the staff is organised in three branches there is only one staff and it has only one purpose to assist the commander in framing his plans and the troops in carrying them out.Organization, of the War Office.37. In 1914 the Army Council was constituted as follows :-3 Ministerial members; 4 Military members;With a Permanent Civil Servant as Secretary of the War Office and the Army Council.At the present time it consists of : &apos;3 Ministerial members; 4 Military members;2 Permanent Civil Servants, who, in addition to being members of the Army Council, are also joint Secretaries of the War Office.Despite the general similarity of the language of the Orders in Council constituting the Board, of Admiralty and the Army Council, the organization and working methods of the two bodies are at many points in striking contrast. In the case of the Admiralty, executive power is vested in, and commonly exercised by, the Board in its corporate capacity; and although individual members of the Board are made directly responsible for the superintendence of specific blocks of business, the Board system provides, in a remarkable degree, for a constant relation of particular items of work to the needs of the Navy as a whole.In the case of the Army Council, each Member is the head of a distinct branch, to which certain duties are ascribed. His responsibility is direct. As a consequence we find a strong tendency for each Member of the Army Council to take the departmental view rather than the broader army view of any question, and to be reluctant to criticize or discuss matters which lie within the sphere of the duties of other Members of Council. If Members do not take their full share in discussing and seeking a solution in a question where interests clash, difficulties arise, decisions are delayed, and there is a danger that the question is not adequately considered in all its bearings. s38. Whether the tendency of the Board of Admiralty towards collective direction and unity of purpose and effort is the natural outcome of longer experience or is in
some measure inherent in the subject matter of naval policy, or results partly from the practice of making the First Sea Lord directly responsible for the sea-going and fighting efficiency of the Fleet as a whole, we are unable to decide. &quot;We feel strongly that the encouragement of a similar tendency in the War Office would contribute greatly to a more effective handling of army problems.By this means the important questions of policy now arising concerning the future organization of the Army, of the establishments necessary to maintain it, of the ancillary services, and generally the best method in peace for carrying out the Field Service Regulations for War would be thoroughly investigated, and the decisions made would carry the weight of the Council as a whole. Further, economy would result in such services as education, in inspection and in rearranging and curtailing duties to avoid overlapping and duplication of w^ork. We realise fully the efforts that all branches of the War Office have shown to effect economies, but we think that this collective action would enhance in every way the work which is being done by the Army Council.39. We suggest that an improvement would be effected if a wider range of questions were submitted to the Army Council. By that means the views of the military members should be obtained rather as leading soldiers than as heads of Departments of the War Office,&apos;but we are not qualified to indicate precisely by what means this object would best be achieved. We can do no more than commend the subject to the attention of the Army Council, merely observing that, in our judgment, the holding of meetings of the Army Council at more frequent intervals than has been customary in the past may perhaps prove an effective first step towards greater unity in the sphere of administrative control.Ratio of the Ancillary Services to the Combatant Corps.40. The Table in paragraph 3 above shows the comparative strength of the establishments of British troops and corps as proposed for 1923/24 in comparison with 1914/15.   The salient points disclosed are : (1.) Total regimental or combatant establishments (group A) show a reductionof 15-7 per cent.; and, (2.) Ancillary services (group B) show an increase of 24-8 per cent. (3.) Staffs and miscellaneous establishments (Group C) show an increase of41-8 per cent.(4.) Total numbers of British troops, excluding India, show a reduction of 10-6 per cent.(5.) Ratio of combatant officers to other ranks is slightly increased.(6.) While the combatant troops (group A) are reduced 15-7 per cent., ancillary services and staffs together (groups B and C) show an increase of29 per cent.(7.) Although there is a reduction of 19,000 men, there is an increase of 440 officers, the ratio of officers to men now being 1 to 14 as compared with 1 to 17 in 1914.The tabular statement in paragraph 7 shows the comparison of the Army by Votes in 1914/15 and 1923/24 and supplements the Table in paragraph 3 by showing cost variations.While it must be admitted that the constantly changing conditions to which the Army of to-day is subject are bound to lay a heavy burden on the administrative services, there are other reasons which play a substantial part m bringing about so important a change in the establishment and cost of those services. The reasons are many and varied, and will be referred to later in more detail. In the case of the Royal Army Service Corps they are the greater dispersion of our forces and the deliberate effort referred to by the Quartermaster-General to improve the services to the troops : in the case of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, the holding and maintenance of greatly enhanced stocks of ordnance material inherited from the war: in the case of the Royal Army Medical Corps the better and fuller service now given. Finally, since 1914 the Army Dental Corps, the Corps of Military Accountants and the Army Educational Corps have been created.Before we deal with these matters in detail we think it advisable to refer to Home considerations in regard to these administrative services which absorb a large and ever-growing proportion of the strength and cost of the Army.
41. Although it has been suggested that there is justification for increases to bring about improvement in the administrative services, we have heard little evidence to show that these services failed in the task which faced them in 1914, On the other hand we find justifiable claims that they carried out their task efficiently and showed a remarkable elasticity in their organisation, which enabled them to cope with the required expansion. Prior to 1914, and apart from the maintenance of our overseas troops, the broad military requirements had been the provision of an expeditionary force with a complete organisation which was designed to be self-supporting and self-contained in every detail.We now provide for an Expeditionary Force of five Divisions and one Cavalry Division, and under present conditions the number of actual fighting units in the Army is less to-day than it was before the war. In view of the limitations imposed by the state of the national finances on the fighting services as on all other public services it appears to us to be of special importance that the maximum number of fighting units should be maintained for the total expenditure available. We hesitate to go further on such a dominating factor in military policy, but we submit that it can hardly be contended that an army reduced as to its fighting strength by 15 per cent, should maintain a staff and administrative organisation on an establishment 29 per cent, greater than in 1914.If the establishment of the Royal Army Service Corps and the administrative services generally is based, upon war requirements, we would point out that the experience of the late war shows that it is possible to rely upon the civilian population of the country to supply at short notice a large number of civilians capable of performing such duties. If, on the other hand, these establishments are based upon the requirements of peace we suggest that even after allowances have been made for the increased numbers required owing to the additional duties arising from the changes in the system of messing and improved standard of living, it does not seem justifiable that the establishment of the ancillary services should have increased by 29 per cent, to provide for an army which is 15 per cent, weaker than the pre-war Army.42. We suggest that considerable economies might be effected by the extended employment of civilian staffs for administrative purposes. The case for a purely military administrative organisation of the ancillary services rests on the theory (1) that only a military organisation can undertake the ancillary services of an army in a theatre of war, and (2) that in peace it is administratively convenient to have military departments capable of carrying out these services in foreign stations. Taking these points in inverse order, it is clearly not impossible in peace to provide certain services such as accounting, education, works, stores and supplies, by means of a civilian organisation.. In foreign stations the Admiralty does in fact provide for all these activities except education on a civilian basis, and at the present time the Air Ministry in assuming control in Iraq and Palestine has substituted a civil works service for the former military works organisation. The weight of -argument lies in (1), viz., that in a theatre of war a wholly military organisation is necessary. .43. It is clear that signals, transport, and such supply units as must work in the forward areas, can only be organised on a purely military basis. As regards stores, works, workshops, postal service, and the rearward half of the supply service, there is nothing essentially military about the nature of the work itself. It is interesting to observe that the Post Office supplied the Army Postal Service in time of war en bloc, but it must be remembered that an important feature of the system was the enlistment in the Royal Engineers of Post Office employees, who were at once transferred to the Army Reserve, in which they served the whole period of their engagement. The case for a military organisation rests on the necessity of having a nucleus of men familiar with the ways of the Army and accustomed to military discipline. The recent war showed, that there were plenty of civilians able to undertake such activities at short notice and without much training; and it is not clear why permanent organisations could not be formed manned by civilians with liability for service abroad in time of peace, and on the lines of communication in war. The broad effect of such a change in policy on the departmental corps would be roughly as follows :        ^(1.) The Royal Army Service Corps would fully maintain its military status, but would receive assistance in its supply organization from civilian labour under the Royal Army Service Corps.
(2.) The Royal Army Ordnance Corps while remaining a military organization should to a considerable extent be manned by civilians for stores other than warlike stores.(3.) Works would remain under the supervision of the Royal Engineers, acting under the direction of the Master-General of the Ordnance, but with the introduction of civilians in the executive of works services, as to which definite recommendations are made later in this report.(4.) Workshops may be civilianised, but on the other hand there is much to be said from a training point of view for their retention on a military basis under the Royal Engineers.(5.) The Corps of Military Accountants would become entirely civilian.44. As to the result of the above proposals on expenditure it is hardly necessary to argue that a civilian organization is normally cheaper than a military one. To take an. illustration ; The Army Ordnance Depot at Didcot is in charge of a Colonel with, it is understood, fifteen other officers of the Corps. We believe that the Naval Store Depot at Portsmouth is in charge of a Naval Store Officer paid at approximately  1,000 per annum, with only three other officers comparable in point of pay with the commissioned ranks at the Army Ordnance Depot. There may be differences in the system of working, but the responsibility and magnitude of the store holding operations at Portsmouth, are comparable with those at Didcot.45. We desire to point out that the changes we have suggested can only be put forward in broad outline. They admittedly reverse the tendency of present policy, which is towards the militarisation of all services on a &quot;regular&quot; basis, and they point to the more general employment of civilians, who should be given commissions in the Reserve of Officers or enlisted in a special section of the Army Reserve, in order&apos; that a lien on their services in time of war may be secured.As we have stated above, in view of the figures of Vote A for 1923/24, we are of opinion that steps should be taken to ensure that whatever national expenditure is allotted to the Army should be directed towards obtaining the maximum, number of fighting troops. We therefore suggest that the Army Council should be asked to review the future requirements for administrative services on a wide and imaginative basis; and that they should not exclude the possibility of drastic change simply because such a change would involve a violent break with tradition.Department of the Military Secretary.46. In 1914 this Department consisted of 2 staff officers, 7 retired officer clerks and 21 civilian clerks. In 1922 it possessed 12 military officers, 8 retired officer clerks and 92 civilian clerks. We have been informed that during 1923 the numbers will fall to 16 officers and 82 clerks.This Department deals with a large variety of questions relating to officers, their promotion, and selection for staff appointments, and with honours and rewards, and generally with personal questions. The large increase is accounted for, according to the evidence of the Department, by the following reasons :-(a.) Additional work of  a permanent character taken over from other departments.(b.) New work created or associated with the reorganization of the Army, (c.) Aftermath work.47. The new duties under (a) involve the work of co-ordinating the selection of officers for staff appointments, which was previously done by the staff of the military members, work in connection with the Territorial Force, formerly done by the Department of the Director-General of the Territorial Force, and the issue of orders to officers to take up staff and extra regimental appointments, formerly done by the Adjutant-General. Under (b) comes the record work in regard to the reserve of officers, selection of officers for new corps, their transfer and seconding, preparation of increased detailed information for the Selection Board and the preparation of &quot; Gazette of the Order of the British Empire.&quot; Under (c) comes a large variety of functions, all of which should lapse in the next twelve months. The Military Secretary rightfully indicates that, whereas in 1914 there was only a relatively small section of the population who might ask for information from the War Office, the [9701] . d
Department of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.50. The duties of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff include the war organization of the Empire, the strategical distribution of the Army, the strategical and tactical principles of the employment of all arms and services, war establish-ments, questions of organization, arms and equipment affecting the fighting efficiency of the military forces, plans of offensive and defensive operations, and the collection, preparation and distribution of information concerning military geography, resources and armed forces of all foreign countries. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff is also responsible for the education and training of all arms. These duties are divided among and dealt with by three Directors, viz. : (1) Director of Military Operations and Intelligence; (2) Director of Staff Duties; and (3) Director of Military Training.51. The increase in the number of officers employed is said to be directly attributable to the largely increased variety of military commitments as compared with 1914: Ireland, the Rhine, the Near East, Palestine, Egypt, Mesopotamia, and India have recently been or are potential fields of military operations.In. the Estimates of 1923/24 the staff of the Department of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff shows a reduction of thirty-nine as compared with the Estimates of 1922/23.Education.52. One of the results of the war has been the greater specialisation of service and of arms and the creation of schools and facilities for additional training of both officers and men. The result has been a large increase of staff and establishments. The following table shows the comparative cost of staff in Training Establishments in 1914/15 and to-day; it also shows the numbers under instruction and the estimated costs for 1923/24:-present position is that the whole civil population of the country may now have some legitimate reason to write to the War Office.48. We recommend that the Department of the Military Secretary should revert as.far as possible to its pre-war position, leaving it as a small, highly confidential and authoritative body in regard to personal questions affecting officers, and to the official work connected with honours, rewards and ceremonials.To this work its activities should be confined, and its establishment should not greatly exceed that of pre-war days. It has to deal with only 5 per cent, more officers, although these are divided among more corps and establishments. We recommend that reduction should be effected by taking away from this Department all work that can equally well be carried out by the Adjutant-General. Under these conditions we see no need for the appointment of a Deputy Military Secretary. A Military Secretary, assisted by a few staff officers and retired officer clerks, should be sufficient to carry out the necessary work and to supervise the comparatively small body of clerks required. Immediate steps should be taken to reduce the number of officers on the active list employed in the Military Secretary&apos;s Department and to replace them, if necessary, by retired officer clerks. The increased cost since 1914 is largely accounted for by the appointment of military officers at high salaries.49. In regard to the Selection Board, we doubt the necessity of assembling twelve General Officers once a month in London for the purpose of selecting officers for promotion and to fill the higher appointments in the Army. We recognise that it is desirable that the Commanders-in-Chief of the Home Commands should be represented on the Selection Board, both because they have personal knowledge of the officers whose claims are considered by it, and because their presence will serve to prevent a feeling of antagonism growing up between the War Office and the Army; for there might be a danger of such antagonism arising if the higher appointments were filled solely on the recommendation of members of the Army Council. We suggest, however, that it would suffice if in addition to the Members of the Army Council and the Military Secretary the Commanders-in-Chief of the three larger Commands only were made members of the Selection Board as was the practice before the war.

Army Education		...					371,230						 	1,950,730It will be seen that the staff costs of training and educational establishments have increased by  584,712 or 233 per cent., and it is clear from the figures supplied to us that the average number of officers and men attending courses is greatly increased.Out of approximately 10,000 officers, 10 per cent, on an average are in course of receiving instruction. We estimate that, out of a total of  1,579,500 for separate establishments, approximately  1,000,000 must be ascribed to the cost of education and training for officers, which works out at an average of  100 per annum per officer on the active list. For each commissioned officer while under instruction the average cost is apparently at the rate of about  700 per annum, to which must be added the officer&apos;s pay, except in the.rare cases where he is seconded.The cost of training of other ranks in these establishments we estimate at  600,000, to which must be added the cost of education in the Army,  375,000. We [9701] d2        ;
thus spend approximately  6 per annum per enlisted soldier on training and education: &apos; &quot;&quot;  &quot; &quot;.....&quot;Undoubtedly the policy of giving extended training and educational facilities has contributed to the notable increase in the proportion of officers and men extra regimentally employed, and also accounts for the increase in the proportion of officers employed.53. The enormous proportion of officers and men constantly absent from their units undergoing courses of instruction is very striking when it is remembered that one of the main functions of the units of the Regular Army at Home is to act as schools of instruction for the training of recruits in order to provide drafts of trained soldiers for transfer to units abroad.Provision must, no doubt, be made for an adequate supply of competent regi-mental instructors; and we realise that to ensure uniformity of method and a high standard of efficiency it is desirable that a considerable proportion of the regimental instructors should undergo courses of instruction at a central training establishment, but we are of opinion that the practice of sending officers and other ranks to schools of instruction has been carried to excess. In many cases they attend schools where they undergo instruction in subjects that they have already been taught in their regiments.We recommend that the schools of instruction should be rigorously overhauled with a view to the reduction of their establishments and of the numbers attending them. We suggest that uniformity of standards and the use of the best methods of instruction in units might economically and effectively be promoted by a system of inspection which would diminish the need for taking officers and men away from their units and would so enable economies to be effected in the Vote for Movements.54. We nowr proceed to deal in detail with the different schools and training establishments : R.M.A., Woohvich, and R.M.C., Sandhurst. We understand that a strong Committee under Lord Haldane is now engaged in enquiring into these establishments. It is therefore needless for us to deal with them other than to point out that the cost of training is very high and to express a hope that savings of a substantial nature may be effected in them as has recently been done in the case of the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth.Staff College, Camberley. This being probably &quot;the most important training establishment in the Army,- is also one of the most costly. At present there are 106 officers in residence, of whom 88 are officers of the Home establishment of the Army, the balance coining from the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force, Indian Army and Dominion Forces. The length of the course is two years, and the estimated cost for this year, excluding pay, is  786 per officer per annum or including pay,  1,416. Accordingly, the training of an officer at the Staff College costs  2,832. We have no doubt as to the necessity for the existence of this College, or as to the value of the training given to the efficiency of the Army. We would only remark that it would appear essential to increase the syllabus so as to afford fuller training in administration, especially as we are recommending the abolition of the School of Military Administration at Chisledon. We are gratified to note the added interest which is being taken in administration by the appointment of additional administrative instructors at Camberley. On the other hand, we feel that economy can be realised by reducing the number of officers passing through the College.In 1914 the average number of Army officers on the Home establishment at the Staff College was 86 for an Army, 15 per cent, larger than our present Army. Excluding those on half-pay, there are to-clay 560 officers in the Army who have passed the Staff College, this represents approximately 5 per cent, of the total officer personnel. If 35 officers per annum passed through Camberley, and assuming 20 years&apos; army life, this would give 700 officers less wastage.Accordingly, we recommend that the maximum number of army officers of the Home establishment at the Staff College at any one time should not exceed 70. We also recommend that officers should not be seconded while under instruction at the Staff College. The depletion of officer strength for the whole army to the extent of 70 should not seriously impair its efficiency in peace time. If these recommendations are adopted the direct saving on pay alone would be approximately  56,000 per annum.With regard to the details of the establishments at the Staff College, an item which appears to us to warrant close investigation is the cost of civilian subordinates. The estimated sum represents nearly 1% men per officer, which Appears high.
School of Equitation. Up to 1921 there was a Cavalry School at Netheravon and a Royal Artillery Riding Establishment at Weedon. These two establishments have recently been combined to form the School of Equitation at Weedon. We inspected this establishment and were impressed by the unsuitability and inadequacy of the accommodation, and by the unfavourable conditions under which the work of the School was being carried, on. To make this establishment suitable for the present numbers under training considerable expenditure must be incurred in providing increased accommodation for officers and men, and additional stables and riding schools. The School costs  65,000 per annum for 160 officers and N.C.0s. per annum, e.g.,  400 per student plus his pay for the period he is under instruction. We hesitate to attempt to assess the importance of cavalry now in proportion to their importance in the past, but the percentage reduction made as a result of the Geddes Report appears to indicate a somewhat lower estimate of its importance by the Army Council. The use of horses in the Army will also be further diminished by the mechanicalization of army transport which is now in progress. In 1914 the establishment of cavalry horses at Home was 10,300; in 1923/24 it is 5,100. It is true that the Artillery establishments of horses have gone up slightly, but this increase is to a large extent one of draught horses.We recommend that the number of officers undergoing courses of instruction should be reduced by one-half. Such a reduction should dispose of the need for incurring large expenditure in providing increased accommodation. We further recommend that instruction in tactics should no longer be given at the School of Equitation, so as to enable the Cavalry and Artillery wings to be amalgamated and consequent reduction of instructional staff to be effected.School of Signals. We note in regard to this school that there is an unusually high percentage of military subordinates; apart from the instructional staff, there are sixty-four military subordinates of other ranks on the administrative staff.We recommend that this be closely investigated with a view to reduction or, so far as is necessary, to replacement by civilians.School of Education. This is the main educational establishment for the newly formed Educational Corps, and it is also^used for the instruction of regimental officers in the art of teaching.Whilst wre realise the advantages of education in the Army, we are not convinced that the very large expense of the present system is justifiable under existing conditions.We have been informed that before the war education in the Army was entrusted to Army Schoolmasters, and evidence was given to show that that system was satis-factory; we accordingly see no reason why that or a somewhat similar system should not be reverted to.We accordingly recommend that the whole system of the Army Educational Corps should be closely examined with a view to abolishing the present School of Education and establishing a more economical system of teaching in the Army.Whatever new system be adopted, it should embrace the valuable vocational training now given at the various centres.Department of the Adjutant-General.55. The Adjutant-General of the Forces is responsible for recruiting and for the training of recruits at depots, for the peace organization and distribution of units, for peace establishments, discipline and military law, for the posting, exchange and transfer of officers, for mobilization regulations and the administrative arrangements regarding mobilization. The Medical Services are also administered by the Adjutant-General. The duties of the department of the Adjutant-General are divided among and dealt with by three Directors, viz : (1) the Director of Organization, (2) the Director of Personal Services, and (3) the Director-General of the Army Medical Services.56. The staff of the Department for 1923/24 is reduced 355 from the estimate figures of 1922/23 and 143 from the figure of the 1st September last. The bulk of this reduction is in the Medals Branch. The Adjutant-GeneraFs evidence was to the effect that until a state of stability was restored to the Army and peace establish-ments were decided upon, he did not expect to reduce much further.We recommend that every effort should be made to expedite decisions as to peace establishments which will automatically lighten the load in both the Directorate of Organization and the Directorate of Personal Services.
57. Under Appendix IV, King&apos;s Regulations, which deals with the distribution of duties connected with the administration of the Army at the War Office, Peace organization and Peace establishments are dealt with by the Adjutant-General, and also the posting, exchange and transfers of officers. As regards the latter, an exception is made in respect of the Royal Army Service Corps, the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and the Remount Service, the Quartermaster-General performing the work in their case. It would appear more logical that these duties should be carried out by the Adjutant-General; and though we realise that it might necessitate the transfer of a small branch to the Adjutant-General for the purpose, we recommend that this should be done.58. Further, we think that it would be advisable that the Adjutant-General should be given increased powers of supervision over all the peace establishments of the Army, and that he should be charged with the duty of presenting to the Army Council a review of the establishments of the combatant arms of all branches and in relation thereto of the establishments of all the administrative services. He should point out any variations from the normal proportions that each should bear to the others, in order that the numbers could be investigated as a whole. The lack of pro-portion, which is so striking a feature in the numbers shown in the Table given in paragraph 3, would, it is hoped, by this means disappear.Royal Army Medical Corps and its Establishments.59. The total cost of Medical and Dental Services for the Army for 1923/24 is the sum of  2,464,250, and, if allowance be made for capital charges on hospital buildings and non-effective charges, the cost represents an expenditure of  12 7s. Id. against every man in the Regular Army. In 1913/14 the cash figure was  5 16s. 5d. Taking all regimental establishments, there are 627 medical officers to look after the health of 154,000 officers, men and families, a ratio of 1 medical officer to 246 men in the prime of life. Taking all ranks and including the Dental Corps, there are 8 per cent, more medical officers and men now than there were in 1914, although the Army has been reduced by 10 per cent. Of this large expenditure on Medical Services, the working expenses of the hospitals represents the largest single item, viz., the sum of  1,117,000. The cost of the Royal Army Medical Corps personnel in these hospitals and establishments is approximately  644,000. The average number of occupied beds in hospitals is 3,000. Accordingly, for each occupied bed the pay of the Royal Army Medical Corps represents  214 per bed per annum. . We have been unable in the time at our disposal to visit the Army hospitals, but we visited&apos; one incidentally when inspecting, the School of Equitation at Weedon. We do not think that this hospital was representative of army practice, but we are bound to say that we were impressed with the extravagance of having a hospital at Weedon at all, and by the unattractiveness of the hospital and the lack of work for the medical officer and staff. In this particular case we have no hesitation in saying that &quot;the hospital should be closed at once and local civil practitioners made use of.60. The expenditure on Medical Services is administered from the War Office by a staff numbering 20 officers costing  32,800 per annum, and in the. Commands by a staff numbering 36 officers costing  81,300 per annum. We have no remarks to make in regard to the Headquarters Staff at the War Office. It has been increased since 1914 by the new Directorates of Hygiene and Pathology, and by new appoint-ments of a Consulting Surgeon and a Consulting Physician. In this country the Military Hospitals and Medical Establishments have a very large staff with responsible officers of high rank as heads. There are, for example, 20 officers at the War Office and 36 in the Commands administering the work of 424 medical officers in hospitals and Commands at home.61. We also draw attention to the cost of the Medical Services at stations abroad. In Egypt there are 53 medical officers and 364 other medical ranks to give medical attention to 9,801 soldiers, a ratio of 1 medical officer to every 185 men plus 1 medical orderly to every 27 men; in Turkey there are a total of 1,029 medical officers and men out of a total force of 19,032; at Gibraltar, Malta, Bermuda, Jamaica, West Africa, Mauritius, Ceylon, Malaya, Hong Kong and North China there are 75 medical officers and 4.37 other medical ranks to give medical attention to 10,565 soldiers, a ratio of 1 medical officer to every 141 men, plus 1 medical orderly to every 24 men. The cost per head for medical services is in some stations as high as  24 6s. per annum.   Taking all these figures
Department of the Quartermaster-General.62. The Quartermaster-General to the Forces is responsible for the maintenance and movement of the Army. He is responsible for transport and movements, supplies and quartering, including the appropriation and occupation of barracks, the supply and holding of stocks of clothing, arms, ammunition, stores and equipment and for mobilization in connection with those services. He is also responsible for the duties and administration of the Royal A.rmy Service Corps, the Royal Army Veterinary Corps, the Royal Army Ordnance. Corps and the Remount Service.. These duties are divided among and dealt with by five Directors, viz. : (1) the Director of Remounts, (2) the Director-General of Army Veterinary Services, (3) the Director of Movements and Quartering, (4) the Director of Supplies and Transport, and (5) the Director of Equipment and Ordnance Stores.63. The Estimates for 1923/24 provide for a total staff of 180 as compared with 231 on the 1st September last and an estimate figure for 1922/23 of 257. The Quartermaster-General &apos;s evidence was to the effect that the dispersion of the Army is responsible for much of the increase of the work in his Department, but that a proportion of the increase is due to the fact that the Quartermaster-GeneraPs services are to-day better performed in every way than in 1914.War Reserves of Materiel.64. We are informed that the provisional instructions, of the Cabinet to the Army Council in regard to the size of our post-war Army are that it shall be so constituted that the necessary overseas garrisons and drafts for India can be provided from linked battalions at home on the Cardwell system, while on mobilization it shall be able to provide an expeditionary force of one cavalry division and five infantry divisions complete. For such divisions there shall be provided a war reserve of materiel and equipment of a like nature to that which obtained in pre-war days and was termed the Mowatt reserve.The position to-day is that the war reserve of materiel and equipment for the expeditionary force is maintained on a much greater scale than under the Mowatt scale. In addition to the full mobilization equipment and war reserves for the expeditionary force there is now held : (1.) Mobilization equipment and war reserves of the following nature for one cavalry and fifteen infantry divisions : Guns, carriages and limbers. Ammunition, wagons and limbers. Guns on railway mountings. Machine guns. Rifles.Accoutrements. Harness and saddlery. Horse shoes. Ammunition.(2.) In excess of twenty divisions the following materiel:  Guns, field, medium and heavy. Guns, super heavy. Machine guns.Rifles and bayonets, including 1914 pattern.The numbers are those which it is possible to store without retaining additional depots for the purpose.into consideration, we believe the Medical Services of the Army to be overdone; and we are convinced that substantial savings can be effected without seriously affecting the efficiency of the services rendered. To define the exact points where establishments should be reduced would involve a prolonged and detailed examination of the Medical Service. In our view, such an examination should be carried out by the Army Council and not by this Committee. We accordingly recommend that the Director-General of the Medical Services be instructed by the Army Council to submit a scheme which will result in an early reduction in the cost of the Medical Service of the Army by not less than 15 per cent.
65. It seems clear that the only reason why authority has been given to hold these abnormally large reserves is that they are in existence. ; If they had not been in existence we cannot believe that the Cabinet would have sanctioned the. manufacture and holding of these enormous reserves on any policy conceivable under to-day&apos;s conditions. We find it difficult to show what it costs the country to&apos; hold these reserves, as they are widely scattered and the cost of storage is difficult to establish. So far as the Quartermaster-General is concerned, he agrees that approximately 2,700 of his civilian staff are directly associated with the maintenance and holding of these reserves; assuming  3 per week per man, then this item alone is responsible for an outlay of approximately  400,000 per annum apart from all considerations of other cost items.We recognise that this materiel has practically no disposal value, while its original cost must have been many hundreds of millions of pounds. We also recognise that to provide this materiel if it were ever required would involve the expenditure of vast sums. Nevertheless, bearing in mind the concentration of effort on the development of new weapons, and the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in 1919 of disregarding the possibility of another world war for ten years, we recommend that these reserves be very substantially reduced immediately so as to save the costs of maintenance.  In other words, we suggest a policy of cutting our loss.Mechanical Transport.66. At present the Master-General of the Ordnance is responsible for the design and supply of tanks and track vehicles, while the Quartermaster-General is respon-sible for the design and supply of all other mechanical transport vehicles for all branches of the services. This sub-division is admittedly a compromise, as its inconsistency is obvious. We are impressed with the fact that the technical develop-ment of transport vehicles is every day becoming of greater importance to the Army, and the more extended use of mechanical transport in the Army may reasonably be anticipated. We also consider that all vehicles using internal combustion machinery should be dealt with by one authority. In the event of a great war, it is obvious that all mechanical transport vehicles, along with tanks, tractors and ordnance materiel, would be dealt with by a Ministry of Munitions, of which the Department of the Master-General of the Ordnance would form an important part. Accordingly, we recommend that the design, production and inspection of all mechanical transport vehicles be transferred to the Department of the Master-General of the Ordnance, We note that, as a rule, the technical branches of the Department of the Master-General of the Ordnance are staffed by artillery officers, and we recommend that gradually the Master-General of the Ordnance, in staffing his technical branches for mechanical transport, tractors, &amp;c, should make increasing use of suitably qualified officers of the Royal Engineers.Training of Mechanics.67. In addition to the development of mechanical transport in the Army, the increased complexity of war material generally has entailed a great increase in the number of mechanics and other skilled tradesmen in the Army. The present rates of Army pay are insufficient to attract high-class tradesmen in normal times, and even during the present period of industrial depression skilled mechanics are unwilling to join the Army, being, we are informed, deterred from enlistment by the liability of foreign service. It has accordingly been found necessary to establish military schools for the training of boys as mechanics for the various branches of the Army. These schools include the Tank Corps Workshop Training Battalion, administered by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff; the School of Military Engineering at Chatham and the School of Electric Lighting at Gosport, administered by the Adjutant-General; the Royal Army Service Corps Mechanical Transport Unit, Aldershot, administered by the Quartermaster-General; and the Artillery College Workshops under the Master-General of the Ordnance. Thus each Member of the Army Council has under him an establishment for the training of boy mechanics. We are informed that a scheme has been approved for the institution of a Central School at Blandford for the training of boys to become soldier artificers; when this school has come into operation, the question of modifying training arrangements now existing will be considered.68. We recommend that all establishments for the training of mechanics should be concentrated and placed under the Master-General of the Ordnance and that use should be made in connection with them of the highly trained personnel
of the Royal Engineers. If this were done, it would be unnecessary to expend money in the advanced training of Royal Army Service Corps officers to enable them to become skilled mechanical engineers. The. Royal Engineer officers by education and training are better fitted to perform these duties. It would be sufficient if the Royal Army Service Corps personnel were trained in the driving, care,and maintenance of mechanical transport vehicles, and if they had such knowledge, as would enable them to carry out those running repairs which- they might be called upon to deal with in the field.So far as; possible, the training of mechanical transport personnel should be done in repair shops, where the personnel will carry out, productive work, rather than in special training workshops, where the work is unproductive. Major repairs should be carried out under the Master-General of the Ordnance, either in repair workshops or by contract.School of Military Administration.69. The School of Military Administration w^as established to inculcate and disseminate throughout tlie Army sound administrative principles - and the practice of efficient interior economy. It consists of (a) an , administrative wing, and (b) a. cooking wing. There are classes in military administration and. interior economy for senior and junior regimental and departmental officers and quartermaster-sergeants and sergeants of the regular and territorial armies. These classes are also  attended by officers of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force; there are also classes in cookery for non-commissioned officers and men. We do not underrate the importance of a knowledge of domestic economy, and we realise that the health and comfort of the men must in a large measure depend upon the interest taken in such matters by regimental officers; but there seems to us no reason why officers should not learn all that they ought to know of the interior economy of their unit either at the Royal Military College and Royal Military Academy or with their unit. Instruction in public finance, national trade and labour problems, which subjects are included in the curriculum at Chisledon, is superfluous for regimental officers.70. We consider that the value of the knowledge acquired at the School of Military Administration is not commensurate with the cost of maintaining the establishment at Chisledon and with the inconvenience involved in taking away officers from their regiments for considerable periods. We recommend that the school should be abolished and that arrangements should be made for such extra regimental instruc-tidii in domestic economy as may be required to be provided for by means of lecturers, who should visit periodically the large stations and should, at the same time, inspect the messing arrangements of units to ensure that the most modern methods are used.71. A central school of cookery for the Army is necessary, but we suggest that it would be more economical to revert to the pre-war arrangement, under which a school of cookery for non-commissioned officers and men was maintained in connection with the Royal Army Service Corps training establishment at Aldershot, than to maintain a separate institution at so isolated and so inconveniently situated a place as Chisledon. At Aldershot the school of cookery will be readily accessible to the units stationed there, and. men sent from other stations could be attached to units stationed at Aldershot while undergoing instruction. We refer elsewhere in our report to the question of training of staff officers in administration.Department of the Master-General of the Ordnance.72. The Master-General of the Ordnance is responsible for the provision and allotment of guns, small arms, carriages and vehicles, and for the administration of the Ordnance College, ordnance factories and experimental establishments. He is also responsible for the construction and maintenance of fortifications, barracks, hospitals and ordnance store buildings and for the technical training of railway and electric light troops and the provision of Royal. Engineer equipment and stores. The duties of the department of the Master-General of the Ordnance are divided among and dealt with by three Directors, viz. : (1) the Director of Artillery; (2) the Director of Fortifications and Works; and (3) the Director-General of Factories.73. The organization of the War Office is, to a large extent,. a reflection of the organisation of the Army in the field; and the experience of the war shows that the close assimilation of the peace to the war organization is essential to enable the [9701 ] e
expansion of the Army in time of war to be carried out smoothly and rapidly. The main element which stands in the way of the complete assimilation of peace and war organization is the supply of armaments and munitions generally. The Master-General of the Ordnance is the only member of the Army Council whose Department is not represented in the organization of an army in the field. His Department is responsible for producing and obtaining all supplies of ordnance material of a highly technical character, such as guns, ammunition, tanks, &amp;c. To enable the Master-General of the Ordnance to fulfil his responsibilities, he has under him technical staffs and establishments carrying out research, experiment, design and inspection functions over the whole range of technical war material. After inspec-tion, all ordnance materiel passes from the charge of the Master-General of the Ordnance to.the charge of the Quartermaster-General as storeholder.In addition to the foregoing duties, the Master-General of the Ordnance is responsible for the Directorate of Fortifications and Works, which deals with the lands, fortifications, rifle and artillery ranges, and with the construction and main-tenance of ordnance buildings, of barracks, hospitals, &amp;c. This Directorate also deals with electric lighting and machinery and Royal Engineer equipment and stores.It was suggested to us that this Directorate and all matters connected with the accommodation of troops should, be transferred to the Quartermaster-General, that, if such a transfer of duties were made, it would hardly be justifiable for the Master-General of the Ordnance to retain a seat on the Army Council, and that his responsibilities could be fulfilled by an officer of status similar to that of the Director of Naval Ordnance in the Admiralty.74.- Apart altogether from the question of which Department carries out the works services, a question which we deal with later in our Report, we are strongly of opinion that the greatly increased importance of the application of scientific discoveries to the development of war weapons and the necessity for pre-serving a progressive policy in regard to mechanical warfare render it absolutely necessary that there should be on the Army Council a member specifically charged with that duty. An Army Council without a Master-General of the Ordnance would be almost like a Board of Admiralty without a Third Sea Lord. The depression of the Master-General of the Ordnance into a subordinate position might easily lead to the neglect of the vital consideration of scientific development in war materiel with disastrous consequences.75. We are of opinion that the appointment of the Master- General of the Ordnance is of the greatest importance. The Master-General of the Ordnance should be the member of the Army Council specifically charged with responsibility for ensuring the scientific development of war materiel. It should be his duty to keep constantly in view the potential uses and future developments of war materiel, and by keeping in close and constant touch with the General Staff to ensure that the tactical aspect of every form of weapon is given full consideration.Works Services^76. The new war staff organization to which reference is made in paragraphs 29-36 above involves the creation in war of a works department under the Quarter-master-General, which will be responsible for works connected with the accommodation of the troops in the area behind the zone of military operations.It has been represented to us that to cany the new war staff organization to its logical conclusion a change must be made in the organization of the War Office, i.e., that the branches of the Fortifications and Works Directorate, which deal with the construction of barracks and all matters connected with the provision of accommoda-tion for troops should be transferred to the Quartermaster-General. It was urged in support of that view that as lands, the construction of barracks and the quartering of the troops are now under different members of the Army Council, it is difficult for any member to obtain a comprehensive view of the problems of accommodation as a whole. It was accordingly proposed that a new directorate should be created under the Quartermaster-General to deal with questions relating to the accommodation of troops in all its aspects.77. It is clear that the whole of the department of the Directorate of fortifications-tions and Works cannot be transferred to the Quartermaster-General, for there are many functions now performed bv the Directorate of Fortifications and Works, for example, those connected with fortifications, telegraphy, searchlights, &amp;e, which have no relation to the duties of the Quartermaster-General.   Any change of the
nature suggested would therefore involve the division of the department of the Directorate of Fortifications and Works into two parts, an arrangement which would tend rather to complication than to simplification, and would be unlikely to lead to economies.78. We are of opinion that the existing arrangement, under which the Master-General of Ordnance is responsible for the design and production of munitions of war and of fortifications and barracks, which he hands over to the store holding or using department on completion, is, on the whole, the best solution of what has always been a difficult administrative problem.A comprehensive view of all aspects of accommodation questions is to be obtained rather by close co-operation between the several branches concerned than by the creation of a new directorate under the Quartermaster-General, which would impose upon that officer duties of a character which lie outside his present sphere.We desire to accentuate the great importance of the Quartermaster-General and the Master-General of the Ordnance working together as close partners. In works services this is specially desirable; and if close touch between the two branches is established difficulties will tend to disappear,We revert to the question of the administration of the works services in paragraph 97 of this Report.Research, Experiment and Design of Guns, Ammunition and Projectiles.79. In our Report on the Admiralty we drew attention to the size and cost of the staffs concerned in the above activities, and stated that we should deal with this subject after we had investigated the conditions obtaining in regard to the staffs employed by the War Office on similar duties.We are aware that a Committee has recently reported in regard to the amalgama-tion of common services for the Fighting Services to the general effect that amalgamation is impracticable, but that steps should be taken to obtain greater co-ordination of.effort between the Departments. That Committee also indicated the possibility of arranging for one service to accept the inspection service of another on certain classes of supply. In the course of this investigation we have carefully reviewed the naval and military organization dealing with the above matters, and we are impressed with the possibilities of unified efforts on the part of the two services in regard to guns, ammunition and projectiles.80. It is a matter of great difficulty to pick out exact figures in regard to expenditure, on account of the different establishments carrying out research, design, experiment and inspection for other war materiel in addition to guns, ammunition and projectiles. The following statement, however, shows approximately the expendi-ture by the Admiralty and the War Office on research, experiment, design, criticism of design, supervision of supply and inspection of guns (excluding carriages and mountings), projectiles, ammunition and explosives (including fillings for torpedoes, depth charges, bombs, &amp;c.) : By the Admiralty-  Guns for experimental purposes ...        ...         ... 71,000Projectiles and ammunition for experimental purposes 8,000 Expenses in connection with inspection and proof, alsoexperiment and research at Shoeburvness andWoolwich...         ...         ...        ...         ... 454,067Admiralty contribution to War Office Joint DesignBranch     ...         ...         ...         ...         ... 14,000Admiralty contribution to Ordnance Committee and war Office Research Department       ...         ... 72,000Woolwich staff of Chief Inspector of Naval Ordnance 55,288Total....... ...     674,355In addition to the above, there is obviously a portion of the cost of the staffs of the Director of Naval Ordnance, including a part of the cost of the Inspection Branch. There is also the expenditure on research and experiment at the Torpedo and Mining Schools in regard to explosives and the design of mines. It is impracticable to apportion correctly these costs against guns, ammunition and projectiles, but the total expenditure by the Admiralty may be approximately estimated1 at  750,000.
The War Office expenditure is : Ordnance Committee, less Admiralty contribution .. &quot;Research Department at Woolwich, less Admiralty129,900 19,200 124,200 66.000contribution Joint Design Department &apos; Costs at ShoeburynessTotal339,300In addition to the above, there is the part cost.of the Directorate of Artillery at the-War Office.. In regard to inspection, we find the costs of the Chief: Inspector of Armaments to be  343,300. In addition, there is a small expenditure at Hoi ton Heath on experiment and research. Broadly, we are satisfied that approximately  If million per annum is being expended by the two services on the objects we have recited.So far as design of guns is concerned, both the Admiralty and the War Office appear to rely in the main on the designs provided by private firms, and to a smaller extent on the designs provided by the Joint Ordnance Design Department at Woolwich. As regards projectiles, the designs adopted are largely those of the Joint Department; while, as regards explosives and fuses, entire reliance is placed on the work done in the Research Laboratory at Woolwich. These design and research departments are supervised, and to a certain extent controlled, by the Ordnance Committee.81. The Ordnance Committee is; a body composed of full-time Naval, Military and Air Force officers, eleven in number, with two full-time secretaries and a considerable clerical staff. In addition to the permanent members of the Committee there are a number of associate members who are administrative heads of technical departments, and finally there are six co-opted members from civilian life possessing high qualifications in chemistry, engineering and mathematics.&apos; The cost of the Ordnance Committee is recorded&apos;in the estimates as  97,000, plus the salaries of the naval and air members, representing a total of  106,000. The Committee is administered by the Master-General of Ordnance, and it is charged with the following iesponsibilities and duties:  (1.) To conduct original research and investigation in connection with the construction and efficiency of guns, ammunition and explosives for the Sea, Land and Air Services, and generally as regards progress in artillery science and improvements in design and material, and to bring to the notice of the Directors concerned the directions in which they consider that investigations are desirable, and the action which they recommend . should be taken.(2.) To undertake such research work and. investigation as is required of them by the Admiralty, War Office or Air Ministry in regard to the following &apos; matters : (a.) Questions relating to improvements in, or suitability of, steel or other material used in the construction of ordnance or ammunition.(b.) New designs or important modifications in existing designs of guns, breech mechanisms and ammunition, including tubes, primers and fuses.(c.) Questions relating to propel]ants and explosives..(3.) To investigate all questions in regard to external and internal ballistics,and to compile and issue range tables and fuse scales for approvedarmaments for all the services. (4.) To investigate all important questions concerning accidents to or failureswith guns, ammunition and explosives and to advise in these matters. (5.) To undertake such investigations for private firms as are referred to themby the Admiralty, War Office or Air Ministry.This Committee is thus the recognised authority for the conduct and supervision of research and design of guns, ammunition and explosives, and it performs this common service for the three Fighting Services, and in addition its work is also made available for the information of private firms. It is an unusual form of organization. We are unaware of any form of activity elsewhere supervised by such a large full-time Committee. Presumably the organization is of exceptional nature on account of
the problems being also exceptional in character. It is of importance to note that initiation of design and research is not one of its primary functions. It merely acts in regard to matters referred to it in particular by the Director of Naval Ordnance and the Director of Artillery. In conducting the investigations it utilises the services of the Research Department at Woolwich which costs annually about  300,000. This Department, which is administered by a staff partially military and partially civilian, is.&apos; divided into directorates, each supervised by highly, qualified technical directors.82. After careful consideration, we have come to the conclusion that the number of highly-paid officers associated with the activities of the Ordnance Committee and I  of the Research Department is out of proportion to their total responsibilities.   So 1   far as we can establish, the following highly-paid officers exercise supervisory J   functions in the conduct of research, criticism of design and approval in regard to guns, explosives and projectiles :; Eleven full-time members of the Ordnance Committee.Chief Superintendent of Research.Deputy Superintendent of Research.Superintendent of External Ballistics.Chief Proof and Experimental Officer.Director of Explosives Research.Deputy Director of Explosives Research.Director of Metallurgical Research.Deputy Director of Metallurgical Research.Director of Radiological Research.Director of Ballistic Research.These twenty-one full-time experts are paid a total of  28,500 for salaries alone. They have also the advice - and assistance of practically every expert in the Fighting Services, and presumably in addition whatever assistance they may ask for from all other research institutions and private firms in the country.83. In 1914 the total salary bill of the Ordnance Committee was  10,620; to-day it is approximately  35,000. In 1914 the total amount of the salaries paid in the Research Department was approximately  19,000; to-day it is  160,000. We agree that progress in applied research in regard to war weapons is of supreme importance, and that possibly we were ill-prepared with modern designs on the out-break of war in 1914. At the same time, we are quite convinced that the enormous growth in expenditure is unwarranted. Without more technical knowledge than we possess we are unable to say whether or not the results which are being obtained from the present expenditure are putting us in a relatively better position than that of other nations. Nor can we say whether or not these Departments are carrying on research, development and experimental work which overlap the work being carried out elsewhere in the country in research institutions and by the technical staffs of private firms. We think it highly probable that this is the case in regard, say, to metallurgical research. We are also of opinion that radiological research should not be carried out in the Government military establishment, but should be handed over to one of the civilian research institutions. It must not be forgotten that there are in existence in this country many private firms who were in a position in 1914 to furnish designs for all sizes of naval guns and gun mountings, of field artillery and machine guns with various mountings and to supply from their own experience and research complete equipment for foreign navies and foreign armies. So far as we are aware, that position still holds good. We have been furnished with certain figures relating to the size and cost of technical staffs by private firms, which are of considerable interest. In the case of one large armament firm, their directing staff of experts, exclusive of draughtsmen, but including designers for all classes of ordnance, naval gun mountings, fire control gear and sights, ammunition of all types, breech mechanisms, field carriages and limbers, in 1914 numbered 47, and their total salaries were  20,000, a figure which to-day might be taken as about  35,000. &apos;84. We do not desire to draw any invidious inferences from these figures,, for we Realise that no exact and definite comparisons can be made; but we have no hesitation m saying that the Army and Navy organizations dealing with the matters now under review have an excessive number of highly-paid officers employed on this work. We are far from desiring to recommend an economy that would have the effect of[9701&apos;!
retarding technical progress, but we are of opinion that the establishments are overgrown and could, without sacrifice of real efficiency, be substantially reduced. In particular, we are convinced that the Ordnance Committee is overweighted with permanent members, that the Research Department is carrying out work which in some cases could be done elsewhere at lower cost, and should be still further civilianized, and that in regard to many of the problems the Ordnance Committee should make greater use of the technical knowledge and facilities obtainable outside the Fighting Services and their establishments.After careful consideration we have decided not to make detailed recommenda-tions in regard to reductions, as in our view, that would involve us in technical considerations which we are not in a position accurately to judge, and accordingly we recommend that the War Office, Admiralty and Air Ministry set up a joint Committee with an outside chairman of high technical and administrative capacity to investigate the.work of the Research Department and of.the Ordnance Committee with a view to a definite reduction in the cost of their establishments of not less than 20 per cent.Inspection of Guns, Ammunition and Projectiles.85. We now come to the expenditure on the inspection of guns, ammunition and projectiles. For the Army, this is carried out by the Chief Inspector of Armaments, whose headquarters are at Woolwich, and for the Navy by the Chief Inspector of Naval Ordnance at the Admiralty. Some years prior to the war, the inspection of these products for the Navy was carried out by the Army Inspection Department. We were informed that the present system of separate inspection was a natural development consequent on the earlier change from the days when the Army supplied the Navy with their guns, &amp;c. The Navy submit that a much higher standard of inspection is required for their ammunition, because it has to be carried on board ship, and the man who sleeps over his ammunition demands the right to inspect it. This appears reasonable, but we are wholly unconvinced that one well-organised Inspection Department for practically similar products cannot be organised to inspect such products to whatever standard is agreed upon, or, if necessary, to two sets of standards. We cannot understand why the Navy, for example, should not trust the product of an efficient Inspection Department, manned largely by military officers, to exactly the same extent as one manned by Naval officers, or vice versa. It is to be noted that both Inspectorates are responsible not only for inspection, but also for the custody and issue of sealed patterns and drawings. The staffs also constitute the closest technical link between contractors and the technical departments of the Admiralty, the War Office and of Woolwich.86. We are conscious that the great expenditure on inspection at a time when comparatively small quantities of new ordnance materiel is being purchased is definitely due to the inspection associated with reconditioning of materiel inherited from the war, and we realise that as this work is completed the inspection costs will go down.&quot; At the same time, we feel that additional costs are incurred by avoidable overlaps on inspection between the Chief Inspector of Armaments, the Chief Inspector of Naval Ordnance, and the officers of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps.In regard to the economy on inspection as between the Chief Inspector of Naval Ordnance and the Chief Inspector of Armaments, we recommend that this should be closely investigated by the Technical Co-ordinating Committee which is to be set up following on the report of the Committee on the Amalgamation of the Common Services. The situation should be reviewed with the object of securing unity of inspection of products of similar character, such as projectiles, guns and ammunition.87. In regard to overlapping between the Chief Inspector of Armaments and the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, a wider question of principle is involved. Ordnance materiel for the Army, whether produced in State factories or at contractors,&quot; is inspected during manufacture and on completion by the Chief Inspector of Armaments as the representative of the Master-General of the Ordnance. The materiel is then handed over to the Quartermaster-General as the store-holding authority for the Army. As the Master-General of the Ordnance is not represented in the field, the Quartermaster-General, through the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, must necessarily exercise wider functions than store holding. He is the custodian of the Army for this materiel; he is the distribution authority, and he must maintain
and carry out minor repairs and generally ensure that the materiel is at all times ready for service and in&apos;an efficient and safe-condition.In carrying out maintenance and repair, re-inspection becomes necessary, and to enable all these functions to be efficiently discharged a certain degree of technical knowledge of ordnance is essential, and consequently there exist a number of highly qualified technical ordnance officers in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps who perform these technical functions.Nevertheless, the Master-General of the Ordnance and his technical depart-ments, in particular those operated by the Chief Inspector of Armaments, are responsible for the technical efficiency of ordnance materiel supplied to the Army; and the Master-General of the Ordnance is the recognised supreme authority on all ordnance technical questions. Accordingly, the Master-General of the Ordnance claims the right to exercise an overruling authority in regard to technical questions associated with ordnance materiel at any stage in its life, irrespective of the store-holding authority. Such a position obviously creates the possibility of duplication in re-inspection; and on account of the immense amount of reconditioning of ordnance materiel as a result of the war, this duplication has assumed a substantial degree of importance. It is also obvious that the Master-General of the Ordnance cannot fully discharge his responsibilities unless he has the fullest opportunities of obtaining the records of performance of the materiel in actual service.88. Another aspect of this question of dual responsibility is associated with the Quartermaster-General&apos;s new scheme for central storage of ordnance materiel. According to the scheme, this materiel will-be concentrated at a small number of depots instead of being widely scattered : to a considerable extent the scheme is now in operation. To complete the scheme it is proposed to remove the ordnance materiel now at Woolwich to Didcot and Chilwell. Apart altogether from the unsuitability of Woolwich as a depot on defence grounds, the Woolwich ordnance stores are old-fashioned and badly arranged for receipt, handling and distribution, and it is asserted that considerable savings could be made on personnel by transfer to Didcot. We understand that this step is at present arrested on account of the dual responsibility we have referred to and a lack of definition of the relations of the Master-General of the Ordnance and the Quartermaster-General in regard to inspection.89. We recommend that it be laid down by the Army Council that the Quarter-master-General should be the responsible authority for custody, store-holding and maintenance of ordnance materiel after it has been delivered to the Army by the Master-General of the Ordnance. Further, we recommend that while the Master-General of the Ordnance is, and must remain, the supreme technical authority for the inspection of ordnance materiel, whether in the hands of the Quartermaster-General or not, yet he should delegate to the Quartermaster-General within appropriate limits the responsibility for inspection of ordnance materiel in his hands, reserving to himself the right of access for his inspection staff to such an extent as he may think fit to ensure that the prescribed technical practice is followed and in order to keep his department in touch with the performance of the materiel in service.Royal Engineers.90. We desire to call attention to the position and duties of Royal Engineer officers in time of peace. After four years of training at Woolwich and Chatham, the young officers of the Royal Engineers are undoubtedly, as a body, the most highly educated branch of the Army. It is essential, more especially in view of the ever increasing application of scientific discoveries to the development of war material, that full use should be made by the Army of the scientific knowledge possessed by the Royal Engineers.  We are not satisfied that that is now done.91. The peace establishment of the officers of the Royal Engineers, we are informed, is based upon the requirements of the Army in war. Great difficulty has always been experienced in providing in time of peace for their training in war duties. A large proportion of the Royal Engineer officers, especially in the rank of Major and Captain, are employed as Division Officers on the construction and main-tenance of barracks at home and abroad. It has been represented to us that that arrangement is economical and that it is valuable as a training for war, for it affords experience both in engineering and in military administration. On the other hand, we have heard evidence from many witnesses who expressed the contrary view, and [9701] g
asserted that barrack work has a deteriorating effect on officers continuously employed on. it owing to the absence of responsibility, the deadening effect of routine, and the ^ fact that they are. seldom called upon to design or execute important engineering works. We have come to the conclusion that this criticism is amply warranted.92. In the course of our enquiry we have visited various military establishments, where we have learnt something of the duties of a Division Officer, Royal Engineers. We are impressed by the fact that those duties not only do not provide training for war. but that, as the Division Officer has little responsibility and is seldom called upon to exercise initiative or to deal with engineering problems of a serious character, the work is, as a rule, quite unsuited for officers who have undergone high scientific training. We are of opinion that to employ highly trained Royal Engineer officers on such duties is administratively wasteful, for the duties could usually be performed efficiently by a foreman of works; and we observe that in the 1922/23 Estimates the overhead charges were no less than 25 per cent, of the total expenditure on works.93. The question of the employment of Royal Engineer officers in time of peace has been the subject of numerous enquiries and we have had before us the reports of several important Committees which have considered the question during recent years without arriving at a satisfactory solution. We recognise the inherent difficulties of the question. The activities of Royal Engineer officers in war are largely associated with destruction or with the construction, of works which are valueless in time of peace, and naturally funds are not readily forthcoming for purposes which are so obviously unproductive.94. We are informed that under the proposed reorganization of the Staff in war, referred to in paragraph 31 above, it is proposed to divide engineering work in a theatre of military operations into two parts : (1) field engineering, and (2) works services. Under (1) will fall all engineering work connected with tactical operations. Such works will be executed by the troops including the Royal Engineer units  placed under a Commander&apos;s orders. The orders of a Commander for the construc-tion of field engineering works will be issued through the General Staff. Under (2) will fall works services of a general nature in the area behind the zone of military operations. Such works will be carried out under a Director of Works, who will receive orders through the Quartermaster-General.It is possible that this division of the functions of the Royal Engineers in a theatre of war may in some measure help to solve the difficulty of finding suitable employment for Royal&apos; Engineer officers in time of peace by enabling a considerable reduction in the peace establishment to be effected. For the figures furnished to us of the numbers required for war do not appear to justify a peace establishment on the present scale, and we recommend that a close investigation into the establishment of the Royal Engineers be made with a view to its reduction.95. It is clear that it is necessary to maintain in peace a sufficient number of Royal Engineer officers to complete the war establishment of the engineer units which form an integral part of the higher tactical formations or which are allotted to armies or attached to General Headquarters; and we understand that there is no difficulty in providing for the employment of these officers in time of peace with Royal Engineer units.A high standard of tactical knowledge or of training in the duties of a field engineer will not, however, be required by engineer officers employed on the works services under the Quartermaster-General in the theatre of war. Competent civil engineers with a good knowledge of the engineering problems encountered in ordinary practice should be capable of performing the duties of an engineer officer in the area behind the zone of military operations.We understand that it is proposed to reorganize the Militia to form a war reserve of mechanics and artificers for the Army. . We recommend that the Militia or Army Reserve organization might similarly be utilized to provide a war reserve of engineer officers qualified to undertake the various forms of engineering works that would fall to the Quartermaster-GeneraFs works department in war.96. If such an arrangement is considered practicable, a reduction of the war requirements and consequently of-the peace establishment of officers of the Royal Engineers might be effected; and it would be possible to deal with the question of the organization best adapted for the construction and maintenance of barracks at home and abroad on its merits.
We have heard arguments against the creation of a new civilian department to have charge of the works services. It is stated that difficulties always arise when an attempt is made to graft a civilian department on to a military organization, and that experience shows that such difficulties can only be removed by the grant of uniform anal military rank and pay to the personnel of the civilian departments so that in practice the advantages of a civilian organization are not obtained.97. We recognise that these arguments have considerable force. In paragraph 78 above we have expressed the opinion that the Master-General of the Ordnance should remain responsible for the construction and maintenance of barracks, and we have pointed out some of the difficulties that would arise if an attempt were made to remove the barracks section from the Directorate of Fortifications and Works. We accordingly recommend that the Chief Engineers should continue to be responsible for the administration of works services in Commands, but that in order to relieve the Royal Engineers of the duties now performed by Division Officers, His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works at home and the Public Works Departments of the Colonial Govern-ments at stations abroad, should, as far as possible, be employed by the War Office for the construction and maintenance of barracks and for works services generally.The conditions at each station should be examined, and the procedure laid down, with a view to deciding as to whether the work should be carried out directly under the Commanding Royal Engineer, with a subordinate staff of foremen of works and civilian surveyors, or through the agencies suggested above.We further recommend that in the case of large or major building schemes the Master-General of the Ordnance should use the services of the Office of Works to the greatest possible extent and thereby bring about a considerable reduction in the design and supervisory staff of his present Directorate of Fortifications and Works, also&apos;the staffs associated with major works in the commands.98. It will, of course, be possible to adopt this system only in respect of barracks and normal accommodation services. Fortifications and other works of a confidential character must remain entirely under the Royal Engineers. In regard to such works all we desire to recommend is that the surveyors&apos; work in connection with them should be executed by foremen of works or civilian surveyors.99. In paragraph 75 we have expressed the opinion that the Master-General of the Ordnance should be the member of the Army Council specifically charged with responsibility for ensuring progress in a scientific development of war material, and in paragraph 66 we have suggested that he should use a staff of Royal Engineer officers, for the design and production of tanks, tractors and mechanical transport vehicles of all kinds.We suggest, further, that a new avenue of employment could be opened out for anumber of officers if the Royal Engineers were regarded, as, in our opinion, they should be, as the expert mechanical engineers of the Army. In pursuance of that policy we recommend that the Master-General of the Ordnance should endeavour to make the utmost use of the scientific knowledge and training of the Royal Engineers for the benefit of the Army by employing them in every branch of his Department for which they may be fitted.Corps of Military Accountants.100. Up till 1919 the system of Army accounting, as applied by the Finance Branch, was based on checking and allocating expenditure against Vote headings, and no attempt was made to allocate expenditure in such a manner as would disclose the actual cost of any particular service or establishment. It was recognised that economical administration was difficult to achieve without knowledge of detailed costs, and the introduction of the present system of cost accounting had as its object improved economy in administration.101. We have found a considerable weight of criticism directed against the system; it is said to furnish a mass of data which cannot be effectively utilised, also data of no particular interest or value and, apart altogether from the cost of the new establishment of the Corps of Military Accountants, the provision of the necessary data for the use of the Accountants&apos; Branch makes heavy demands on the staffs of many of the branches of the War Office and the Commands. The Corps of Military Accountants itself numbers 790 officers and men costing  236,900 for pay [9701] &quot; G 2
alone. We are informed that a War Office Committee is now enquiring into the costing system generally with a view to meeting the criticisms which have been directed against it. In these circumstances we shall only deal with the question in the broadest sense.In the first place, it is not clear to us why a Military Corps is necessary for accounting work; the posting of every one of millions of vouchers of expenditure to specific heads is not work which should be done on a military basis, and we recommend strongly that immediate steps be taken to have whatever cost accounting work may be required, done by a civilian organization.102. As regards the various cost units which have been adopted as the basis of the present Army Estimates, it is not by any means clear that the knowledge thus made available for Heads of Departments and Commanding Officers can be used to any material extent to control expenditure. In most cases it appears that the main items of expense are completely outside the control of the responsible officer, and that generally speaking only the cash items, which were, in any case, significantly shown under the old system of vote heads, give any scope for economical management. It has been repeatedly stated in evidence that the Heads of Departments still rely on the old vote headings for their control over expenditure, and it is not clear in most instances in what way the new units of cost can be put to practical use.103. We recommend that the old system of presenting the Army Estimates should be re-established, and that whatever cost figures may be considered necessary should be included as appendices to the Army Estimates. Generally, we have formed the impression that the machinery used for the compilation of the present cost accounting is much too elaborate and expensive. The essence of good cost accounting is the provision of only such cost data as can effectively be made use of, and not the preparation of data of merely academic interest.Summary of Recommendations. 104. The following is a summary of our main recommendations :  General.(1.) The pay of the Fighting Services and the pay of the Civil Service should be closely reviewed in relation to the scales of remuneration of the rest of the nation by a strong and authoritative Committee appointed by the Cabinet (paragraph 10).(2.) The conditions in Government Departments as regards working hours, overtime and holiday leave should be reviewed at the same time, and by the same body that is set up to deal with pay and remuneration (paragraph 12).Organisation of the Staff.(3.) The staff organisation of Commands in peace should correspond to that prescribed for war, and the post of Major-General in Charge of Administration should be abolished. An officer combining the functions of the Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General should be responsible to the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief for the co-ordination of the Administrative Services, whose heads should be financially responsible for the administration of their respective services (para-graph 33).(4.) The Heads of the Administrative Services and Departments should have the status of Commanding Officers of their Departments and should cease to function as if they were in addition on the staff of the General (paragraph 35).(5.) In the &quot; Army List &quot; the staff should be shown together and the Adminis-trative Services apart from them (paragraph 35).(6.) All Staff Officers should be employed for a time in the junior grades of the Administrative Staff (paragraph 36).(7.) The duty of the General Staff in regard to Educational Establishments is to lay down the guiding policy, to provide the syllabus of instruction, and to conduct the examinations. Responsibility for the administration of Training and Educa-tional Establishments should rest with the Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General within their respective spheres (paragraph 36).Organisation of the War Office.(8.) The Army Council should review its own constitution and practice with a view to strengthening its collective responsibility for Army administration (para-graph 39).
Ratio of A ncillary Services to the Combatant Corps.(9.) The whole administrative organisation of the Army should be reviewed on a wide basis with a view to reduction of establishment and cost (paragraph 45).Department of the Military Secretary.(10.) The Department of the Military Secretary should be reduced, being relieved of all work that can equally well be carried out by the Adjutant-General. The appointment of the Deputy Military Secretary should be abolished (paragraph 48).(11.) The numbers of the Selection Board should be confined to the General Officers Commanding-in-Chief of the three larger Commands, the Military Members of the Army Council and the Military Secretary (paragraph 49).department of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.(12.) The schools of instruction should be examined with a view to the reduction of establishment and the numbers attending them (paragraph 53).(13.) The maximum number of officers on the Home Establishment at the Staff College, Camberley, at any one time should not exceed seventy. These officers should not be seconded (paragraph 54).(14.) The cost of the civilian subordinates at the Staff College, Camberley, should be investigated with a view to reduction (paragraph 54).(15.) The number of officers undergoing courses of instruction at the School of Equitation should be reduced by one-half; the Cavalry and Artillery wings should be amalgamated, and instruction in tactics should be omitted from the syllabus of instruction (paragraph 54).(16.) The numbers of military subordinates at the School of Signals should be closely investigated with a view to reduction, or, if necessary, replacement by civilians (paragraph 54).(17.) The whole system of the Army Educational Corps should be closely examined with a view to abolishing the present School of Education and establishing a more economical system of teaching in the Army (paragraph 54).Department of the Adjutant-General.(18.) Every effort should be made to expedite decisions as to the peace establishment of the Army (paragraph 56).(19.) The posting, exchange and transfer of officers in the Royal Army Service Corps, the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and the Remount Service should be transferred from the Quartermaster-General to the Adjutant-General (paragraph 57).(20.) The Adjutant-General should be given increased powers- of supervision over the peace establishments of the Army and should be charged with the duty of presenting a review of the establishments of the combatant arms of all branches and in relation thereto of the establishments of all Administrative Services (paragraph 58).(21.) The Army Council should instruct the Director-General of Medical Services to carry out a comprehensive review of the Army Medical Services with a view to submitting a scheme which will result in an early reduction in the cost of the Medical Services of the Army by not less than 15 per cent, (paragraph 61).Department of the Quartermaster-General.(22.) The war reserves of materiel should be substantially reduced (para-graph 65).(23.) The design, production and inspection of all mechanical transport vehicles should be transferred from the Department of the Quartermaster-General to the Department of the Master-General of the Ordnance (paragraph 66).(24.) Establishments concerned with the training of mechanics should be concentrated and placed under the Master-General of the Ordnance, and in these establishments use should be made of the highly-trained personnel of the Royal Engineers (paragraph 68).(25.) The School of Military Administration at Chisledon should be abolished, and arrangements should be made for such extra regimental instruction in domestic economy as may be necessary to be provided by means of lecturers and inspection (paragraph 70).(26.) The Central School of Cookery should be transferred from Chisledon to the Royal Army Service Corps Training Establishment at Aldershot (paragraph 71).
Department of the Master-General of the Ordnance.(27.)The Master-General of the Ordnance should be the Member of the Army Council specifically charged with the responsibility for ensuring the scientific development of war materiel; it should be his duty to keep constantly in view the potential uses and future developments of war materiel (paragraph 75).Research, Experiment and Design of Guns, Ammunition and- Projectiles.(28.) A Joint Committee should be set up by the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry with an outside Chairman of high technical and administrative capacity to investigate the work of the Ordnance Committee and the Research Department with a view to a reduction in the cost of their establishments of not less than 20 per cent, (paragraph 84).Inspection of Guns, Ammunition and Projectiles.(29.) The Technical Co-ordinating Committee, which is to be set up in accordance with the report of the Amalgamation Committee, should review the Inspectorates of the Chief Inspector of Naval Ordnance and the Chief Inspector of Armaments with the object of securing economy and unity of inspection of products of similar character, such as guns, ammunition and projectiles (paragraph 86).(30.) It should be laid down by the Army Council that the Quartermaster-General should be the responsible authority for custody, storeholding and main-tenance of ordnance materiel after it has been delivered to the Army by the Master-General of the Ordnance (paragraph 89).(31.) The Master-General of the Ordnance, who is the supreme technical authority for inspection of ordnance materiel, whether in the hands of the Quartermaster-General or not, should delegate to the Quartermaster-General within appropriate limits responsibility for inspection of ordnance materiel in his hands (paragraph 89).Royal Engineers.(32.) A close investigation into the establishment of the Royal Engineers should be made with a view to reduction (paragraph 94).(33.) The Militia or Army Reserve organization might be utilised to provide a war reserve of Engineer officers qualified to undertake certain forms of engineering works which would fall to the Works Department in war (paragraph 95).(34.) The Royal Engineers should be responsible for the administration of works services, but His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works at home, and the Public Works Depart-ments of Colonial Governments at stations abroad, should, as far as possible, be employed by the War Office for the construction of barracks and works services generally. In the case of large or major building schemes, the Master-General of the Ordnance should use the services of the Office of Works to the greatest possible extent (paragraph 97).&quot;(35.) Surveyors&apos; work in connection with fortifications and other similar works should be executed by foremen of works or civilian surveyors (paragraph 98).(36.) Royal Engineer officers should be employed by the Master-General of the Ordnance in the design and production of tanks and mechanical transport vehicles of all kinds, and in every branch of his Department for which they are fitted (paragraph 99).Corps of Military Accountants.(37.) The Corps of Military Accountants should be abolished; and whatever cost accounting may be required should be performed by a civilian organization (paragraph 101).(38.) The old system of presenting Army Estimates should be re-established and whatever cost figures may be considered necessary should be included as Appendices to the Army Estimates (paragraph 103).Military Requirements of the Empire.105. In conclusiqn, we desire to represent that in order that establishments may be fixed on the most economical basis, it is necessary that an early decision should be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the essential functions of the Army and the military requirements of the Empire.
Royal Air Force.106. Our reference directs us to enquire into the establishments of the Air Ministry. Preliminary enquiries show us that the strength and role of the Royal Air Force is now under consideration by the Committee of Imperial Defence. The structure of the organization is still in course of formation, and presumably defence policy may necessitate modifications. Accordingly, we have come to the conclusion that the present is an unsatisfactory time to carry out any investigation and that little useful purpose would be served by it.107. We have now concluded the task set to us, but we make no pretence of having exhausted the subject. To review completely the activities of two such large and complex organizations as the Navy and Army is obviously impossible in the time available to us. Nevertheless, we feel that while the methods of achieving reform which we have suggested may perhaps require modification on close examination, we also feel that they will be of value in pointing the way and will result in reductions of cost without impairing efficiency. We have held sixty-three meetings and have heard evidence from sixty-five witnesses and we have visited a certain number of naval and military establishments. At every step in our work we have received not only uniform courtesy, but cordial and hearty assistance from every Department and from the members of the Board of Admiralty and Army Council.Conclusion.(Signed)WEIR (Chairman).H. G. MILES.R. R. SCOTT.J. R, CHANCELLOR,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, May 8, 1923.
