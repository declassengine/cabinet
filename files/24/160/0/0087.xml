[this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s government.](Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1923.)secret.CP. 289 (23).CABINET.My colleagues are generally aware of the serious financial position of India. They are aware that after a series of deficits spreading over several years and amounting to nearly 70,000,0001., the Government of India, by drastic economies, both civil and military, and by the imposition of new and very unpopular taxation, have this year succeeded in balancing their Budget, but that, in order to secure the necessary taxation, in spite of its refusal by the Legislative Assembly, the Viceroy has been obliged to make use of the emergency powers reserved to him. Gn the other hand, credit is taken in the Budget for 200 lakhs on account of stocks an economy which cannot be repeated and for contributions from the Provinces amounting to some 900 lakhs, to the abolition of which, as soon as the linancial situation permits, the Government of India are publicly committed. The prospect that the reduction of troops now proposed will permit of any substantial reduction of taxation is thus remote.The cost of the Army alone has risen from 27,87 lakhs in 1913-14- to 60,4-2 lakhs in 1922-23, to which must be added 733 lakhs for other defence services. .The military economies to be effected include economies on account of stocks, staffs, clothing, military works, Marine, Quartermaster-GeneraPs services, reduction of troops, &amp;c, and amount in all to some 600 lakhs. As regards staffs, the whole of the savings, amounting to approximately 10 lakhs, recommended by the Inchcape Committee, are being effected; of these, 6 lakhs are being saved on Army Headquarters and 4 on Commands staffs.Of the total of 600 lakhs, the reduction of troops is responsible for 279&apos; 6 lakhs as follows : (1) Reduction in strength of each of the 45 battalions of British infantry by130 men.   Saving for full year, 145&apos;3 lakhs. (2) Reduction of three British cavalry regiments.   Saving for full year, 74 lakhs. (3) Reduction of one cavalry brigade headquarters.    Saving for full year,-1 lakh.(4) Reduction of one battery of Royal Horse Artillery and its ammunition column.Saving for full year, 911 lakhs. (5) Reduction of one full field troop of Sappers and Miners.   Saving for full year, 1&apos;7 lakhs.(6) Reduction of one brigade of Roval Field Artillery. Saving for full year, 28&apos; 3 lakhs.(7) Reduction of 64 men in each of active infantry and Pioneer battalions, other than Gurkhas, less substitution by 77 Class I. reservists per battalion. Saving for full year, 20- 5 lakhs.The effect of these will, of course, not be felt in the present year.Of these reductions, Nos. (3), (5) and (7) concern Indian troops only; Nos. (1), (2), (4) and (6) concern British troops.The Secretary of State for War agrees with me that the reductions proposed in (1) and (4) can be carried out.As regards reduction No. (U), it is proposed, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for War, to adopt an alternative method of producing approximately the same financial saving, by the reduction of establishments throughout the Field Artillery in India, involving the reduction of some 600 British personnel and a number of horses.The Secretary of State for War has also agreed to the reduction of two of the three British cavalry regiments proposed in (2) above. As regards the third, proposals are still under discussion.I therefore ask the Cabinet to take note of the reductions as specified above, subject to the reservation that under head (2) the question of the disposal of one of the three British cavalry regiments remains for farther discussion.PEEL.26th June 1923.6296     .100     6.23
