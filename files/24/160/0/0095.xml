Walton Hewbold rhraww, M.P., by a majority of over 2,000,000. Clause (b) of the Edinburgh resolution dealing with the eligibility of delegates was deleted:   this clause has in the past been interpreted as a ban on delegates who were communists.The organised unemployed at Plymouth, under the leadership of a communist, have recently twice attempted to raid the Guardians&apos; Offices.
j^COMMPHISISThere has been very little surface activity on the part of the communists during the past week:   this is due in part to the absence of tnm&amp;y of the leaders and in part to the efforts made to secure representation and support at the annual conference of the Labour Party.The labour Party conference rejected the affiliation of the Communist Party by a majority of 2,514,000: while this will be a crushing blow to the communists, they have managed to increase the number of their supporters and a comparison of the voting last year and this year is not uninteresting.1922 Against affiliation        3,086,000For n 261,000Majority against 8,825,0001923Against affiliation For &quot;Majority against2,880,000 366,000 2,514,0001923Decrease in majority &quot; 311,000 against affiliation?L.923Decrease in votes against affiliation206,0001923Increase in votes for affiliation105,0001923Decrease in total vote101,000There would appear to be a shortage of funds, possiblytemporary/
temporary, at King Street as the Communist Paty   la trying to arrange a mortgage of  2,500 on the premises.Communist officials are beginning to realise that many members of the party have no liking for &quot;iron discipline&quot; or for the really hard tvork which is expected of them;   in some oases the the District Party Committees have gone the length of expelling or &quot;lapsing&quot; members who fall short of the expected standard and the Organising Bureau has in consequence issued the following rules, in order presumably to avert a considerable decrease in membership:i   &quot;(1)    That members who neither work nor pay dues should, after warning has bean given, be lapsed according to the rules:(2)    That expulsion from the Party (as distinct from lapsing) should only coour because of the gravest reasons - in pr&amp;otioe only for political unreliability.    Further, members so expelled by a District Party Committee should be reminded that they have a right of appeal to the Party Executive.(3)      Cases of members who are unsatisfactory in ways other than (1) and (2) should be dealt with by censure.&quot;The article on &quot;The Baldwin Ministry&quot; by J.T. WaltonMewbold, M.P., to whioh reference was made in lastwecfs report has been *N*fc up for the &quot;Communist Review&quot;and will probably appear in the next issue.COMMuTOTS AS RUSBIAH IMTBTJilQEHOB AGMTSAn extension of the theory that communists oweallegiance to Russia and not to their own oountries    /.-is foreshadowed in the following report, which has reached me from a source, whioh has hithc-fteproved reliable:&quot;The/
&quot;The Russian Soviet Government is aflopting for the future an entirely new policy with regard to the method of obtaining desired intelligence respecting the internal affairs of other countries. The ouatom of depending upon Soviet officials, whether Trade Delegation members or others, for intelligence, ia discontinued:   all spies of Russian nationality are to be withdrawn:   and in the future, no Russian will be entrusted with the work of conveying political or other secret intelligence, regarding the affairs of other states, to his own Government,&quot;In lieu of this, information is to be obtained exclusively from the heads of the communist organisations on the spot - that is to say, in the respective lands.    The practicability, simplicity and cheapness of such a policy will be apparent, as the Communist Party has members who are workers in dockyards, arsenals,&apos; Government offices - and attached to military and naval forces even - in all countries^ When information is required upon a certain point regarding a certain State, the question will be merely passed to one of the communist leaders in that State! who will obtain the desired intelligence from the    j members who can moat advantageously procure it, and will pass it on to Moscow by the moat suitable me an a * Risks with letters or telegrams need not be run, aa these leaders frequently visit Russia personally.&quot;THE RED IBTSRNATIOBAL OP LABOUR UftlOMSThe annual conference of the South Wales Miners&quot;      \Federation last week decided to take a ballot of thecoalfield on the question of affiliating to the RedInternational of labour Unions:   it is said, however,&apos;that some of the officials object to the expense of a ballot as they oonslder the majority of their members are .ropposed to affiliation:   there i3 nevertheless no doubt    ithat the extremists have contrived to gain a good deal of influence within the federation and have aeoured thesupport of a few well known leaders, such as S.O. Davieaand Noah Ablett.Some of the British delegates to the Mosoowconference of the Red International of Labour Unionsleft/
left last week, Bf. Lismer of Sheffield reaching Berlin on June 22nd.On June 14th the &quot;International Propaganda Committee of Revolutionary Transport Workers&quot; addressed &quot;to all revolutionary organisations and opposition groups of Transport Workers&quot; a number of &quot;directives&quot; for agitation and propaganda in support of the decision of the conference held in Berlin on May 23rd and 24th.    These iiwtrootlona, despite their ietfiil, contain no new matterand it Is not probable that they will have much effect in Great Britain. THE YOUNG OCMMUMST LEAGUEThe Young Communist league of Great Britain intends to conduct a &quot;special ohildren&apos;8 campaign&quot; from June 24th - 30th,but has not so far achieved any marked result.The Political Bureau of the Communist Party has informed District Committees and unattached looals that:&quot;It is necessary that all Party members working in the Children&apos;s movement undertake the oelebratione end arrangements for the week in the closest oo-operation with the Y.C.I. branches.&quot;The week is being made the occasion of anappeal for joint action and the formation of a United Front of all existing proletarian children&apos;s organisations on the basis of a programme of immediate demands for working class children, drawn up by the B.O. of the Y.C.I.&quot;All Party members should energetically work for the adoption of this programme by the various Sunday Sohools and other children&apos;s organisations.&quot;It is to be hoped that this Second International Children&apos;s. Week to be held in this country will be the occasion of Demonstrations and agitation by the Communist Children for our immediate demands and result in the enrolment of an increasing number of the proletarian children In the struggle of their olass.&quot;The Central Executive of the Young Communist Leagueof/
SOSof Great Britain has sent a circular to all league and Party branches in the course of whioh it is stated that:&quot;The breaking up of the proletarian family of to-day is increasing from Say to day.    father and Mother are at the factory or else unemployed. In many oaoea there is no Father at all ana the children must help to make a living.    The children of the working class are, therefore, underfed, yes, tuberoulor (as a result of the capitalist syttem of sooiety), they lack clothing, footwear, etc. etc.&quot;The spiritual and physical neglect of the children of the workers is increasing every day.   The children of the proletarian must live in narrow, stuffy and damp flats, like animals, the proletarians era crowded together into these holes.&quot;The parents cannot devote themselves to the education of their children,    Thus, the children themselves .are subjected to the bad influences of the street and to the whims of the teachers, who are serving capitalism.&quot;It ia, therefore, high time, that ye systematically begin to work agatosV&quot;tnis influence. and gather the children&quot; of the, workers^ under communist leadership.    It Ti, therefore, &quot;up to the children in our communist children^ sections to call their attention to their miserable situation, to show them the reason for the same, and to inoculate them with hatred against the child killing capitalist class.&quot;It is their duty to explain to their school mates, the role of bourgeois schools, and to organise, the struggle against the monotonous and stupefying education, against the military sohool discipline and against corporal punishment in the sohools.&quot;The bourgeois sohool is the hotbed of aati-bolshevik white guards of future strikebreakers and oounter-revolutionaries (scabs and blacklegs).   In teaching religion the capitalist morality la given the ohildren by spoonfuls.    in teaching history the proletarian ohildren are Imbued with chauvinism, end the reactionary teachers agitate against the workers and their organisations, while other teachers who sympathise with the working class and its cause/ are discharged.&quot;In another document issued by the   Central Executive the &quot;partial (minimum) demands for the struggle of the communist children on behalf of the proletarian ohild&quot;are/
THE UNEMPLOYEDThe communist George Ebury, who has for aome time been the leader of the organised unemployed in Plymouth, was responsible for a disturbance at the offices of the Board of Guardians in that borough on June 19th.   The Chief Constable has sent the following report of the sequel to ^ march of about 200 men, women and children to the officeaon/are set out;&quot;1.    Free school meals for all children of theworking class whoso parents cannot afford to provide them with the saina.2.    Free distribution of clothing and boots for all children of the working class (as above).3.    Setting up of Kindergartens, Homes for children whose parents are working, Holiday Camps and play centres.    Children&apos;s Hospitals for proletarian children suffering from tuberculosis,-free medical treatment for all working class children.4. All these institutions to be under the control of the workers organisations, vis, Parents Councils, Trade Unions, Trade Councils.5.    Abolition of corporal punishment and the use of the cane in school.6.     Ho useless teaching, curriculum to be supervised by representatives of the workers organisations (parents Councils, Trade Unions, Trade Councils) and the children (Pupils Councils).7.    Severe penalties for Infringement of child labour laws, teachers to report cases of child exploitation to Trade Councils. &quot;The League organisation in the West of Scotland isacknowledged by communists to be in a &quot;load state&quot; and it isdoubtful if it has any great following in other parts   ofthe country.   Headquarters in this country, as well as theInternational Executive in Moscow, seem now to be aware ofthis state of affairs and there are signs that efforts willbe made in &quot;she near future to improve the organisation.
on that date:-&quot;The Guardians refused to receive the deputation, and informed them that they should state their case to the Relieving Officers&apos; Committee.   The Unemployed were not satisfied with this reply, and Ebury informed the crowd that he intended to see the Guardians to-day, and told them not to got downhearted.   He said, &apos;They will have to meet us.   I am fed up with trying to deal with them constitutionally, and if they won&apos;t meet &apos; us that way we shall have to make them meet us.   They *. won&apos;t leave this building to-night until they receive;; our deputation&apos;.    He balled for volunteers to picket each door of the house, and posted six men at each of the. three entrances.   He said, &apos;If you sea any member. Of the Guardians attempt to leave the building, down him.   Plug him In the eyes.   They are asking for it, ; and by Christ they shall get it.     You need not worry, I shall be the one who will get into trouble, not you. 1 shall be put into clink, but I don&apos;t trouble about that,   i have been there before and I. can go there again.&apos;   A little while afterwards he detailed a further twenty men to go around to the rear of the premises, and after a few minutes there was a scuff1* inside the building, and a few of tho members rushed I out shouting &quot;Come on George.   Come on lads, sing the Red Flag.&apos;    Ebury shouted, &apos; They are.in, Come on lads&apos;, and he made a rush with the orowd towards the front entrance.   There was a scuffle for some time, all trying to force their way into, the building, but the Police Officers in attendance managed to clear them from the building, although Ebufcy refused to get :. outside the railings with his men.   One ..of our Policemen received injuries in the scuffle.   Ebury-told the orowd that the Guardians refused to see them to-day.   Ha     )- .. suggested voting as to whether they should remain, and they voted in favour of remaining.   Supt. Denley, then spoke to Ebury, and the latter addressed the crowd again.   He asked them to withdraw, whioh they did, marching away with their banner - *The Red Flag&apos;.&quot;According to the Press a further disturbance was oauaed by Ebury and his followers on JVne 26th, in the course of which the police dispersed the crowd with bStons: on June 27th Ebury was charged with inciting persons, to commit &amp; breach of the peace.   An official report of these developments has not yet been received.IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAIg ,little of importance has occurred in Irish extremist circles during the week.The Honorary Secretary of the Deportees&apos; association has/
has sent a circular letter to all deportees asking each member to guarantee  50 towards the expenses of the trial of Art 0&apos;Brien and his companions in Lorn.&apos;on.   ilia  50 are to be refunded from the compensation that they will receive from the Government for their arrest and deportation.The result of the trial is awaited with great interest and some trepidation as it is feared that if a conviction follows it may have a great effect on the future of the le ague.
