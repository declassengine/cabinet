IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.&apos;CABINET. HOME : AFFAIRS COMMITTEE\ % PERTAIN POINTS ARISING IN CONNECTION with the trade boards gill. MEMORANDUM BY the minister qp IeORET . LABOUR.LP.812(85) .1.     Tho Drafting Sub-Committee, appointed by the Homo Affairs Committee, feel that three pointo arising upon their consideration of tho Trade Boards Bill should be brought before the Home Affairs Committee for decision.2.     V/withdrawal of Trades.     A point of some interest arises on the first two oub-soctions of the Bill as drafted.     In the form ao circulated to the Home Affairs Oommlttoe Sub-Clause 2 provided, with regard to the withdrawal of trades from the Act that &quot;If at any time the Minister is of opinion that the conditions of smploy-ment in any trade to which this Act applies aro euoh that tho application of this Aot to tho trado is no longer necessary he may, aftor csuoing a public enquirv to be held, make a special order withdrawing that trade from this Aot&quot; .     It should ba observed with rogard to those words that thoy aro not. tho wordc of the 19IS Act.     There was no recommendation on the point in tho Cave Report. Under the 1918 Act the words read &quot;if at any time the Minister in of opinion that tho conditions of employment in any trade ..... have been oo altered as to ronder the application of the principal Aot to the trade, unnecessary&quot;The short point is this.     A number of trades were brought in between 1918 and 19RS on the lees rieid
conditions of tho 1-18 Aot,     It is claimed for some of them at least that they would nevor havo Been brought in under the more rigid terms of Clause 1 of tho Bill. It is urged, thoreforo, that in order to be withdrawn theso tradoo should not bo required to satisfy tho original conditions of tho 1910 Act but only thoso of tho Bill.This is a reasonable point and the words in tho Bill as -circulated wore intended to meet it.     On consideration, however, they   appeared ambiguous and the new words were inserted.     These make it clear that a trade ouch as tho Grocery trado, which was brought In under tho 1918 Aot is entitled to demand an   enquiry as to whother it should romain in under tho 1925 conditions.     On the othor hand for tho future the proper principle of the Trado Boards Aot would bo re-affirmed, namely, that trades could only be removed from the Act when thoy had purged thomsolves of tho difficulties which brought thorn undor it,     Tho Sub-Committee of tho Home Affairs Committee aocopted the new form of words.3.     Position of Oonvonts, etc.     Religious and charitable institutions frequently carry on trades c-ovorod by tho Trade Boards Acts, and in particular laundry work-,    in some oase3 hired workers who are not inmates of the institution aro omployod and the Trado Board rates under the existing Acts apply to persons thus employed.     This will also bo tho position under tho draft Bill.     It is, however, tho usual practice for the bulk of the w0rk to be performed by
members or inmates of the institution (in the case of convents frequently by the nuns themselves,,In the caso of rescue homes by the peroons who are undergoing training and reformation),    Under the existing Acts the view Is held that although such institutions aro engaged in trado, tho inmates are not affected by the minimum rates as they are not employed persons within the meaning of tho Aoto (see section 0 of the Trado Boards Act, 1909). The purpose of the proviso under ccnnlderation in to make this absolutely clear.Certain Boards, and In particular tho Laundry Board, havo made bitter complaints about tho competition they moot with from Institutions and have repeatedly urged tho Minister to introduce legislation to compel institutions to pay tho Trade Board rates, to their inmates. I do not think that it is possible to challenge tho opposition which would bo brought by religious and philanthropic interests to suoh a provision in tho Bill. In any event the subject will be raised in debate upon the Bill, and ny view is that it will bo boat to inaort words in tho Bill on tho linos of tho proviso to Clause 16 (l) to mako tho Government&apos;s position perfectly clear. It will bo ocen that tho proviso to Clause 16 (l) cJ so clears up tho position as to persons employed in schools, instructional factories and similar institutions.     I think there can bo no doubt that such persons ought not to bo brought within tho jurisdiction of tho Trade Boards.*&apos;   Method of settling questions of demarcation. Olauso 25 (l) of the Draft Bill deals with tho question of determination of demarcation problems.     In the Gave
Report it was recommended that these problems, as to settlement of which there had been much controversy, should be decided by the Minister of Labour on the precedent of the Unemployment Insurance Act with an appeal to the High Court.  In the Bill as drafted it will be soon that the decision is made by a Referee subject to appeal to an Umpire (who may be the same percon an the Umpire for Benefit question under the Insurance Act).   The  reason for tho change made here is that it has been found in the course of the operation of the Insurance Act that the machinery of decision by the Department, subject to appeal to the High Court, has been a little cumbrous. The questions at issue are of a character which would normally not be decided by the High Court but probably sent by them to Referees. They are of a very technical character requiring very close knowledge of the trades involved and could perhaps be better settled by an authority specialising upon this kind of work. In so far as a Referee is substituted for the Minister, there is no substantial change but the procedure has been brought into line with the Insurance Act procedure in respect/of benefit. I think that the present proposal is on the whole the b?t as a matter of administration.
