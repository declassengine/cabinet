HIS DOOUJJMT IS THE PROPERTY BF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * S. $0 vTSREigENT.EGI,p. 345 cs&amp;CABINET.CRADE   PROSPECTS.Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a note on prospects in the difforent trades as given to me, In confidence, by representatives of the trades at the last meeting of the Board of Trade Advisory Council : and of the views of the Council in regard to&apos;the continuance of the Export Credits Scheme.(Intd.) P. 1.1.-Q.Board of&apos;Trade,16th May,  1933.
BOARD OP TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.May 2nd, 1923.1. Trade; Outlook.Col. Buckley invited the members of the Council present to express thoir views with rogard to the trade position now and in the near future.Sir Charles, Addis. (Chairman of London Committee of Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation) said that trade in the Far East, especially in China, had not continued the favourable tendency shown at tho close of last year.     The political disturbances in China were interfering with oommunisations, and there was diff ioulty. in getting raw materials from the interior,., Pieoe-goods stocks there were at present within manageable limits, but traders were hesitating to take up contracts; trade was somewhat quieter than a short time ago.     There seemed to be little prospect of the two contending factions coming to terms at present.In India the improvement on the whole continued slowly.In Japan conditions were dull, the only favourable feature being the silk trade;    this was also especially active in China.Sir James Allen (High Commissioner for New Zealand) remarked&quot; as regards the trade position in New Zealand, that there had been a fall in the price of butter, as a result of over-importation into this country of Danish butter, which could not find a market on the Continent on account Of unfavourable exchanges.Mr. Hirst (Chairman and Managing Director of the General Eleotrio Company, Limited) said that, as regards export business in the electrical industry, he had observed that during the last five or six weeks there had been an increase in the purchases of domestic electrical commodities;    this seemed to be an indication that h6avy electrical engineering would follow suit in a few months1 time.     There had been a number of orders for apparatus of the smaller kinds from the Argentine, China, South Africa and India-     At home he was well satisfied with the business of the last throe or four months, although in the last few weeks there seemed to have been a little holding-baok;    this might, however, be only apparent.     The electric?,! industry was rather more optimistic than it had been for some time past. ,mSir William Pearoe (chemicals:   Association of british; Chemical ManufacturersT Director of Spencer Chapman and jfesseli.* Limited, and Member of the Council of the Federation of British Industries) said that the position in the heavy chemical industry was satisfactory, especially as regards soda;    the general trade, however, was marking time somewhat, and had made no further progress lately, though perhaps no ground had been lost.As regardB the situation in the German chemical industry, he remarked that practically all the German factories were in the oooupied area;   it might well be asked why the French Government did not put pressure on the German Government through-P-
\CONFIDENTIAL.tho medium of the chemical industry; since that Government derived a larger revenue,, ho thought, from the chemical industry than from tho whole of the rest of the Ruhr. Unless the two nations could come to an agreements action on these lines might well be taken by the French Government: if so, the supply of dyes, pharmaceutical products and fine chemicals would bo considerably affected. The British industry was watching tho position with much interest and some anxioty, but on the whole tho effect had been to help it, although largo stocks had prevented the beneficial effect from being felt immediately1.Tho Gorman chemical firms in the occupied area including the Badische Works, were pursuing the policy of passive resistance, but the Oppau Works had been reconstructed.    An agreement had been entered into between tho French and Germans as to nitrogen, as well as one between tho German A.G. and the French industrialists as to fino chemicals; thoso agreements had probably modified tho attitude of the French Government somewhat.   Ho had striking evidence as to the amount of revenue, derived from export licencos, collected by the German Government from tho fine chemical industry, and thought that pressure on the Germans through their chemical industry would be the best card that the French could play.Mr, Lindsay (Indian Trade Commissioner, for the India office &quot;said that the position in India continued to improve: the favourable trade balance was maintained. In Larch, exports were of the value of 22 millions sterling, and imports 18 millions, leaving a favourable balance of 10 millions; of this, 5 millions had gone in the purchase of gold.,    There had been a turn-over from an unfavourable balance of 20 millions sterling during the official year, April 1921 - I arch 1922, to a favourable balance of 18 millions during the year April 1922 - Larch 1923.In textiles there had been a change in fashion; the demand for grey goods had advanced greatly; that for whites remained steady, while fcr coloured goods tho demand had fallen off heavily.    Tho imports of piece goods for 1922 were slightly higher than thoso for 1920, and there had boon a big recovery from tho trade of 192.1. Imports of machinery had boon of the value of  13,000,000 in 1920, and  20,000,000 in 1921, but had dropped to  15,000,000 in 19,22..    There had, however, recently been a re*-casting of the Indian tariff on macbinory which would probably benefit tho electrical engineering industry in this oountry.There was still no stop to tho absorption of gold, of which India had taken five millions sterling in March and     similar quantities for each of the last two or three months&apos;,   Tho cause was probably that during tho wer India&apos;s normal trade demand for bullion could not bo met and she was now engaged in filling up the resultant gap. There had been a&apos;change - of taste from silver to gold.   However, this absorption of bullion was bound to come to an end sooner or later.    Stocks of textiles in India were low. Tho present slackness of demand&apos; for British textiles was probably duo partly to the agitation in favour of homo-made goods, and partly to the relative cost.   The change in the colours in demand was
also attributed, to the Gandhi agitation against European goods.. &apos; which had caused popular taste to veer from coloured goods to whites and greys.Mr. Pugh (General Secretary to the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation) said, speaking from the point of view of the Unions, that the position in the iron and steel industry remained much as it was at the time of the last meeting, with a tendency towards improvement.   Manufacturers appear to be over-coming to some extent their difficulties in obtaining raw materials, such as coke.     There was a good deal of uncertainty owing to the situation on the Continent, hut the position was much better than it was six months ago.     He took a hopeful view for the future..Mr. Sutoliffe Smith (Textiles: Bradford Dyers1 Association) said that there had been a further falling off in orders in the wool trade, and trade was being taken by the French.   The position was worse than it had been for some time.   It had come to his knowledge that certain manufacturers were considering the alternatives of either closing seme days each week, or of working for. stock:   he had advised the latter.     Uncertainty in prices was produced by the French offerings.   The textile trade was sore over the recent Franco-Canadian agreement, which had had the effect of reducing the preference enjoyed by British textiles over French textiles in Canada from 7-1 to 2t%\    the benefit of this small percentage of preference was rendered negligible by the depreciation of the franc.In the East and China, purchasing power&apos; was gooc;, but our prices were too high, and seemed likely to remain so as long as the price of raw material remained at its present level.   There had been a considerable extension of the Wool trade in China, and. there would also be some with India if prices could be reduced.As regards dyes, the Bradford Dyers1 Association had before the war used 80$ of German dyes,;    whereas now it was using 80$ British, 10$ Swiss, and only 5$ German.   This 5$, however, repre-sented certain essential shades (mostly vat colours), which could not at present be obtained elsewhere, and delivery of these was now held up as a result of the Ruhr situation;    the Association were, however, endeavouring to overcome this difficultye     In respect of Swiss dyes, the French manufacturers had an advantage over us, in that tue Swiss sold cheaper to Roubaix than to the&apos; English manufacturers, for the reason that, on account of the incidence of the Dyestuffs Act, we only take from them a few essential dyes, and not the staple ones,     Ho reparation dyes were being received at present, owing to the situation in the Ruhr, though seme had come in not long ago;    also no dyes were coming in under licence;    these latter were more important, as they were essential onesiSir Edwin Stockton, M.P. (Abbot &amp; Stockton, Cloth Merchants, Manchester;    President Manchester Chamber of Commerce) said he had not much fresh to report as regards the manufacturing side of the cotton textile industry;    it was just holding its^ewn. The markets were in need of goods, but were holding back on account of high prices, in the hope of being able to buy more cheaply later on.     The short time which was being worked. In Lancashire was putting up prices in Manchester.   A depressing effect had been produced in Manchester by the failure of a well-known China firm of one hundred years&apos;  standing, with liabilities of over a million.
He thought there would be a fair amount of business if prices could be reduced; at present the cost of raw materials and of finishing prooesses were both high.   On the whole he considered that the manufacturing side of the industry had not gone back, but was holding its own -Col. Armstrong (Past President of the Council of the Federation of British Industries; Chairman of Greenwood and Batley,   Limited, Engineers, Leeds) said that there were signs of improvement in general engineering: a oertain number of orders were being received from abroad, and enquiries were being dealt with more seriously than they used to be.   These came not merely from the Continent, but more especially from the Colonies and China: there were even a few from Germany. The situation on the whole seemed a little more promising.Mr * Sanderson (Sanderson, Murray and Elder, Limited, Australasian Merchants, representing Australia on the Advisory Counoil) said that the position in Australia was generally good except for the drought, which was causing a good deal of anxiety.   The lack of rain was affecting the sowings of wheat. In other directions conditions were generally good.   In Western Australia, it was true, the rains had been sufficient, and in the rest of the country the position would become satisfactory if there were a good rainfall during the next month.Mr. Holroyd .(Cotton: ofR.and J. Holroyd, Limited, Halifax, Federation of British Industries, and Federation of Master Cotton Spinners1 Associations) could see no improvement in the yarn section of the cotton trade.   He had recently attended a meeting of the International Cotton Committee and found from reports made there that it was not this country alone which was suffering; the representatives of Holland, France, Italy and Spain, and in fact all countries excepting Sweden, had reported that they were producing cotton yarn under the cost of production and were working short time.   This fact pointed to excessive cost of the raw material.India had taken in 1922 only half the quantity that she had taken in 1914 and yet she had had to pay rather more than in 1914*   China, he believed, was practically bare of stocks, but dared not import on account of the disturbed political situation; in the past she had been our second largest market.   Turkey, our third largest market, was also suffering from the effects of war conditions..The wages agreement with the operatives had terminated on 25th April: the&apos;operatives asked to have wages stabilised for another two years: at present either party had the right to give a month&apos;s notice for alteration.   A meeting had been held to discuss the matter on the 1st instant: no conclusion had been reached, but he was hopeful that there would be no difficulty in arriving at a settlement.As an instance of the rise in price of piece goods, Mr. Sutollffe Smith mentioned that China was paying 5*84d. per yard in 1914, as against I5*48d. at the present time.Lire Lindsay (Indian Trade Commissioner for the India Office) said that as regards India, this trade had expanded since last year: India was taking half as muoh piece-goods again, chiefly from this country.
Mr. Murray (Commerce: Messrs. Ker Bolton and Company, Glasgow, East India Merchants) said he had little to report.   Java, Singapore and Siam had bought a considerable quantity of goods early in April, but demand was now slacking off in hopes of lower prices for Manchester textiles.   These markets were, however, bare of stocks and were bound to buy soon.    In rough goods a healthy demand continued; the outlook all round was not unpromising.Mr. Arthur Balfour (Chairman and Managing Director of A, Balfour and Company, Limited. Capital and Dannemara Steel Works, Sheffield; Chairman of High Speed Steel Alloys, Limited &amp;c, President of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce) said that the stoppage in the Swedish iron and steel industry was helping home manufacturers.Japan was buying practically no iron and steel, but China had taken more in the last two or three months than she had in the preceding twelve.   The demand from India was bad, and that from South America fitful.   The Canadian market for iron and steel, however, was improving considerably; this was also the case with Australia and New Zealand: an adjustment had been made in the rates of the Australian tariff on steel.   At home more and larger orders were being received, but little business was being done with the Continent, except Spain and Belgium: Belgium, however, was buying a good deal.    The United States trade had been hard hit by the Fordney Tariff.   Though prices there had not risen as quickly as had been anticipated on account of heavy stocks, the price of tungsten steel and certain other special steels in the States was now rising.The Fordney Tariff had helped us to pick up a certain amount of business in South America, China and elsewhere, on account of the high tariff and high cost of production in the United States. The rise in the price of billets had, however, checked buying considerably.Mr. Tait (Non-Ferrous Metals: Chairman of British Aluminium Company, Limited, and Director of British Metal Corporation Limited) said he had little to add to his last report as regards the non-ferrous metal trade; there had been a slight falling off in demand, but this was probably seasonal. Order books showed a satisfactory position, and prospects seemed good.Sir Robert Glanfield (Chairman of George Glanfield and Sons, Limited, London, Wholesale Clothing Manufacturers) said there had been little change since last month.   Although in bulk the trade was not up to its pre-war level, there was not much unemployment, all expert workers being taken up.    The training of young workers had been neglected during the period after the armistice*    Though trade was in most instances better than last year, makers were complaining of the paucity of orders: their order books were not at all full. Retailers throughout the country were holding off, and generally complaining.   Weather, however, was an important factor with the home traue.   As regards the export trade, South Afrioa had shown some slight signs of improvement during the past fortnight: enquiries and indents had been better.The position in regard to suppliers-of clothhad undergone some change; though the price of the raw material remained high the clothing trade was getting the benefit of reduced charges, as a result of competition: orders for piece goods&apos; could no&apos;./ be negotiated at. lower prices than a month ago.   He mentioned that a big firn in Yorkshire which had been asking, fourteen weeks for delivery was now prepared to deliver in five or six weeks; this fact cast some light on the position as to the amount of orders for cloth.   Competition had brought down the retail prices of certain classes of ready-made clothing to a pra-.tica.lly unremunerative level, but for the better quality goods prices remained high.

Buckley stated that the Scheme; as at present constituted, was due to expire in September next,&apos;and It had been his personal feeling that it should be allowed to do so. Enquiry had, however, put a different complexion on the matter; Col. Peel, the Chairman of the Export Credits Advisory Committee had drawn up a memorandum on the subject, in whioh he reoommendei continuance of the scheme for a further period of 2 or 3 years. This memorandum had been discussed by the Advisory Committee to the Department cf Overseas Trade and they had concurred in its r ecoomon&amp;a11on,Mr. Moore (West African Merchant) said that there had been a conil&quot;cTeraBIe set-back In the price of staple West African productsj    this would affect the ability of merchants out there to buy finished goods..Mr. Evan Williams (President Mining Association of Great Britain)&apos; said&quot;  EatThe&quot; demand for coal continued active both for inland and for export, though the quantity sold for export on forward contracts was not, so far,very large;    there was a good deal of difference between buyers&apos; and sellers&apos; Ideas as to price.     The demand from Germany oontinued, and that from France and Italy was notably strong.     Other markets not affected by the situation in the Ruhr were also showing increased strengthsIn a number of districts increases in miners&apos; wages had taken place on tho results disclosed for January and February; the results for March and April would be reflected on the 1st July, and would mean further considerable advances in wagesn The.average wage of miners as a whole (including boys and youths) throughout the country during January was about 9/8d. per day;    excluding boys and youths, the adult wage averaged. To/sd. per day, for.a working week of about 5-g- days.In addition, the following remarks had been received from Mr. Arthur Waj^son (General Manager, London, Midland and Scottish T^Tlway &quot;Company) on the trade outlook from the railway point of view:.-&quot;Although there are no figures available whioh will show the Great Britain railway position since those published by the Ministry of Transport for December, 1922, taking the London Midland and Scottish Railway position as being typical of that generally of the Railways in the country, the following are the approximate percentages of increases in Merchandise, Minerals, and Coal and Coke, for the 16 weeks ended April 22, 1923, compared with the corresponding period in 1922s-
Two methods had been utilised, namely (l) advances in cash: this method had now been discontinued for some time; probably a somewhat heavy loss would be sustained on it;  (g) a system of guarantees; under this a considerable amount of business had been done, and there now remained only  1*551,000 outstanding as against sanotions totalling over  21*000,000*The amount of business to which the scheme had given rise was not, however, to be measured merely by the amounts of actual advances made and guarantees given, since it had inspired confidence and had led to the initiation of business through moral support.Colonel Peel in his memorandum estimated that a considerable amount of employment had been produced and some l^ million sterling spent in wages as a result of the scheme.   He put down a figure of  75*000 for eventual loss on Guarantees already given *   All shades of opinion on the Department of Overseas Trade Advisory Committee, including the banking interests, had recommended that the, scheme be extended for another two years at least *Sir Charles Addis said that the question did not affect him direotly.   He thought the scheme useful, however, as helping to bridge over the gap between the short term credits given by bankers in the normal course of business and the long credits which some manufacturers required.Mr. Hirst said that in some cases the existence of the Export Credits scheme had led to the initiation of business which the parties concerned had had no hopes of opening other-wise, but they had eventually found that they could put it through without appealing to the Department.Sir William Pearce said that the banking members of the Department of-&quot;Overseas-Trade Advisory Committee had given it as their opinion that there was a substantial volume of long-term business, outside the ordinary operations of bankers, which the Export   Credits Committee could assist*   The general opinion was that the soheme had performed UBeful service..Sir Edwin Stockton remarked that guarantees to the amount of some  580,000 had been given for textiles.   Textile firms, however, were- in general not much affected, since   they oould get the credit they required through the banks for business whioh was worth getting.The opinion was expressed that the use of the scheme for oonsumable goods, such as coal, should be discouraged and more used for engineering and manufactured products.Sir A. Shirley fienn.P.,  (President, Association of British Chambers of Commerce) said lie understood that&apos; charges were being made whioh would provide a fund against bad debts .Sir William Clark replied that the  75*000 loss to which reference had been made was on guarantees&apos; alone, but Colo Peel considered that this would be more than wiped out by the oommiasion oharged on all transactions.   Considerable losses had, however, been sustained on the earlier system of advances, on account of the depreciation of foreign exchanges, especially in Roumania.Col. Buokley observed that the Department was fortunate in having secured the services of the gentlemen who were now administering the scheme.The Council considered unanimously that the soheme should be continued for a further period.
