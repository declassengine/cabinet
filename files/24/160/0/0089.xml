We see things much clearer to-day.   New political questions have sprung up.   We must now examine to vjiat extent the decisions of the Fourth Congress were correct and in what manner they were carried out.   In many countries the political situation has altered in favour of the capitalists.   America is experiencing a boom;   the situation in England and Prance has improved.   In Central Europe the former disorganisation prevails:   Japan is on the eve of a crisis.   The International situation is for the moment characterised by the Anglo-Russian complication.   The new tendency has begun in England not because Russia has grown weaker.   On the contrary, it is because/
because it has been growing stronger.   The capitalists were deceived by the now economic policy.   They thought it was the beginning.;Of our capitulation.   They thought that the conarunists would bring about their own ruin.   But out situation improved;   Russian grain appeared: on the world market;   we have never before enjoyed each undivided support of the workers as we do to-fiay.   Therefore perhaps, a new chapter in the attitude of the capitalist States towards us is beginning...&quot;On the question of the United front we have over-come many difficulties during this period...   Many have called me. an obstinate opponent of the tactic of the United Front.   That is riot true,   formerly I had doubts, hut. now I em a convinced partisan of the tactic of the United front.&quot;The RiI.Ir.tf. achieved considerable success, during this period^   Hot more than a year ago many of our members believed the R. I.L.U. to be a premature creation.   They will now have changed their minds...&quot;We&apos; are having e dispute with the Swedish party., iThere Foglund is expressing the point of view that not only for the State, but also for the party, religion ie a private affair;   We rau3t oppose this point of view stubbornly...&quot;Our attitude toward the peasantry and toward the national question.     In this we still have a strain of the Second, International in us.   Out British Party still does not understand the great significance of national emancipation.   On this question it ie radical in&apos;words, but cannot make up its mind to some bold action either in the case of Ireland or the Colonies..,.&quot;Our slogan of a Workers&apos; Government must be extended to:    &apos;A Workers&apos; and peasants&apos; Government&apos;.,.&quot;A Workers&apos; and peasants&apos; Government is a circumlocution for the dictatorship of the proletariat. If we intend to have a real dictatorship of the proletariat, we must understand how to win over the peasants...The slogan Can be of great service in all countries.*.If our party adopts the peasants, then every worker who has any connection with the land will become an agitator.   If we are unable to make the peasants our supporters, we at least can induce them to be neutral...&quot;J.T. Walton Hewbold&apos;s contribution to the discussion on 2inovi6v&apos;s speech is summarised in the &quot;InternationalPress Correspondence&quot;&apos;&apos; as follows&quot;Walton llewbold (Great Britain):&quot;The British delegates took exception to the tone of comrade Sinoviev&apos;s speeoh on- the subject of Nationalism and the Colonies, but they would explain their point of view in the Commission,
&quot;The tactic of the United Front was bringing the. Party increased influence throughout the country.   The ; lead of the Communists wss being followed in many; of ? the Trade unions, especially the engineers and miners^ The hold in the Trades Councils had been strengthened.&quot;At the Edinburgh Conference last year the leaders of the labour Party got a resolution passed attempting to exclude the Communist Party.   At the forthcoming annual Labour Party Conference, at least^13 Trade Councils and 2 big Unions would support the affiliation of the Communists.&quot;Turning to the new slogan the workers&apos; and peasants  Government, the British Communist Party enthusiastically welcomed it, but preferred v&quot;argsj&apos;s modification:   a Workers&apos; and Working peasants  Government.   The land workers in England had always been naglected by the advanced Labour Movement.   There was no peasantry in England;   they had been driven to the Colonies or the towns in the eighteenth century. In Ireland, there was a large peasantry and the slogan would furnish the impulse the Irish Party needed for its development.&quot;On the subject of religion, the British Communist Party is agreed as to the necessity of attacking the Churches, but this could be done best by the Party&apos;s direct and indirect educational institutions.   The communigis strongholds were in the mining areas of West -Scotland anci South Wales, and amongst the miners there was a large religious population.   Similarly, almost the whole of the Irish peasantry were staunch Catholics. An attack upon religion in Ireland would make the&apos; development of the Party there impossible for many years.   The British Party was always reproached with having no hold on the masses.   Would it not therefore be better to attack religion indirectly and not directly?&quot;COMMUNISTS AND THE LABOUR PARTY CONFERENCEAocording to the issue of the &quot;Workers Weekly&quot; of June 30th, 52 trade union branches and 40 Trades and Labour Councils and local Labour Parties, have either passed resolutions in favour   of   * Coramuniot^Party affiliation to the Labour Party or have notified the Communist Party of their support:   the organisations ooncerned are:&quot;Amalgamated Engineering UnionSt, Helens, Ho. 1 St. Helens, Ho. 2 BroadLsath, No. 2 Broadhaath, Ho. 3 Gravesend, Ho. 2Sheffield, Ho. 4Pendleton, No. 2 Gorton, EastConfd/

r i*4 O d i 0Party, both locally and nationally.   This branch feela strongly on this matter and has declared that it will seriously consider withdrawing its affiliation from the Manchester Borough. Labour party if affiliation is refused.&quot;On June 29th the Political Bureau of the CommunistParty issued to District Party Committees and unattachedLocals en important statement on the policy which is to be pursued as a result of the recent conference of the labourParty:    the text of this document is as follows:-&quot;In the first instanoe, the deletion of the infamous sectrlcm (b) is a distinct triumph for our Party,      Its aaletion not only Justified the correctness of our tactics in&quot; the campaign for affiliation but demonstrates to us the point of attack to which our forces should be concentrated for the future.   From this success It is quite clear that we have a wide and sympathetic lie Id for activity in the Trades Unions, Trades Councils and local Labour Parties.   That is shown by the long list of these bodies published in the Party organ this v/eelc which have already passed resolutions in favour of affiliation.   The significance of these resolutions must not, be overlooked in the satis::?action obtained from the deist ion of section (b). We must..see to it that  his support is maintainedTnust now work for an ever wider and increasing number of similar resolutions until we convince Socle3ton Square of their futility of seeking to keep the Communist party as a Party out of the Labour Party.&quot;The Central Committee sees in the deletion of this clause (b) the removal of the anomalies that prevented or handicapped communists from acting as delegates from Trade&apos;Unions, Trades Councils or Local&apos; Labour Parties to labour Party Conferences.   This means that   no obstacle now stands in the way of Communist Party members seeking to take an active part in such bodies.   Wot only must our members take advantage of the opportunities now afforded to become delegates but It is of the greatest importance to join up with local labour Parties and widsn&quot; the sphere of our activities through the Labour  arty itself..   Our struggle is now sharply define da   The issue is now the Communist Party*s right bo affiliation against the opposition of the Eodg&apos;5 3, Hendersons and Macdonalds.   Our campaign from below is alearly the right line of advance and we must continue our effort by this means.She sympathy tcwards the Communist party amongst the delegates as a whole was striking and  had the question to &quot;be decided by a show of hands we would probably have carried the day. . But the machinery of the delegation vote pa-rtioularly of the larger unions where in many cases the fbloc1 was thrown against us by/
by narrow majorities points to the importance of careful examination in the methods of election as well as the personnel of future delegations.   And we must give this question ovx attention .rlght away. &quot;&quot;&quot;%Be adverse vote*&quot;on&quot;Tine 1it*otal^Sip for Neisbolcf was quite natural after the previous decisions and only calls for comment in so far as it reveals the determination of the leaders of the labour Party not to yield ground except under pressure from the mass of the membership below.&quot;A report of our work as a ufoole in connection with the Conference will be prepared and issued as soon as it is compiled.&quot; (N.B.   It is reliably reported that a copy of the report on the Conference will be taken by Tom Bell to Moscow). &quot;Meantime all Party members are urged to begin immediately and Bystematicallj-the task of widening the influence of the Party and winning over the majority of the workers towardB securing affiliation next time.&quot;The Central Committee of the Communist Party has alsoissued, in leaflet form, an &quot;Open letter to the Delegates ofthe Labour Party Conference,&quot; in which the delation of clause (b) of the Edinburgh Resolutions is hailed as agreat victory:   the committee affirms that:-&quot;The Communist party is not dismayed by the overwhelming majority against its claim for Party affiliation.   Apart from the fact *hat its vote this year is 105,000 larger than last year we know that the real obstacle to final success lies in the pernicious bloc vote, which in many oases was swung this year by misleading statements and misrepresentations of our Communist aims.        But just as we have defeated the designs of Eccleston Square on thlB occasion so surely will we overcome the bloc vote.   We are not, nor will we be, deterred from pursuing our campaign for affiliation.&quot;Comrades, you have done well this year in compelling your leaders to wipe out the blunder of the Edinburgh Conference.   We are confident that you will seal that with the affiliation of the Communist Party next time.   By your decision you have taken an important step in securing united working-class action.   And none too soon.   The Capitalists can see no way out of the world-chaos they have created.   Fascism and reaction are rampant in our midst.   Now, more than ever, must we stand four-square for a United Working-class Front.&quot;THE &quot;DAILY HERALDn AND THE COMMUNISTSOn June 28th the &quot;Dally Herald&quot; published a &quot;leaderette&quot; entitled &quot;Making it Plain&quot;, on the attitude ofthe/
the Labour  arty to the communists, In the course of whichit was stated that:-&quot;Few people, either in the movement or outside it, seem to have an exact understanding of the reason why Communists are not considered eligible for membership of a constitutional body.&quot;That reason is simple.   Communists do not agree with constitutional methods.   Their idea is&apos; to bring about changes by violence.   They would overpower the authorities and the forces behind the authorities, seize power and establish a dictatorship. They are in favour of class warfare and class rale. They think it necessary to suppress the opinions of those who do not agree with them.- &quot;The Labour Party believes that changes which are to be lasting or beneficial must be made with the consent of the mass of the people.   It aims at per-su.ad.ing a majority of the electors to share Its views.   It believes in free speech and free printing. It detests dictatorship,   universal comradeship is its ideal, not the supremacy of any one of our present transitory classes.&quot;Thug, while both aim at the same goal -Production for Use instead of Production for Profit -they differ diametrioally as to the means of attaining it.   That is why Communists are not eligible for membership of the Labour Party.&quot;On the following day, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; publishedthe following statement by Tom Bell: -&quot;Permit me to correct the erroneous statement concerning the methods of the Communists, appearing in your leaderette entitled &quot;Making it Plain1.&quot;First, there is no bar on Communists becoming members of constitutional bodies.   Apart from the fact that wo are all trade unionists, the removal of olause (b) of the Edinburgh resolution was the deliberate act of the Labour Party Executive and conference, to facilitate the representation of Communists in trade unions, trades councils, and local Labour Parties and national Labour Party conferences.&quot;We have always declared our readiness to use, and in fact do use, the constitutional machinery afforded us to its very limits to bring about changes;   but we do not olose our eyes to the limits of the constitution..     Moreover, as the straggle of the classes sharpens, we feel confident the workers will face these limitations and overcome them.&quot;In plain words, the workers will be faced with the task of seizing power.&quot;Certainly, changes must come through the aotioft of the majority of the people, espectially the workers:   but wo do not agree that it is alwaysnecessary/
j t dn*c*ssary, or will always to possible, to count noses in order to tell when wa have a majority.   The. I&amp;pour jarty recognised this in 1920, when the masses of the workers in this country declared that they would not have war on Russia.&quot;Nor can the question of the class war be the reason for the rejection of the affiliation of the Communist Party.   The Labour Party, the dominant party in the new Labour-Socialist International, accepts the class war.   Clause 1 of its constitution is quite explicit on that,&quot;Our rejection cannot, be based on any refusal to use constitutional methods, particularly under certain historical circumstances.   For, again, the highly constitutional International Federation of Trade Unions of Amsterdam, to whioh the British Trade Union movement is attached, declares for the ;general strike and economic boycott.   This great love of constitutionalism, we fear, only enables the Labour Party leaders to retard the breakdown of Capitalism, instead of attempting to smash it;   and that we bQlieve, because they have no desire to do so.&quot;A BOLSHEVIK BAPTISM JOn June 24th a ceremony took place at St. John&apos;aChurch, Hurst, which by reason of interest rather than of:importance seams worth reporting.   The vicar, the Rev.R.W. Cummings is a ooranunist who has previously baptised :a oonrounist in his church.   On this occasion a male and female child were named respectively &quot;Lenin de ValeraMaokay&quot; and &quot;Rosa Luxemburg Mackay&quot;.After a hymn from the &quot;Social Crusade&quot; sheet, thevicar delivered an address in the course of which he said,.,referring to the children:&quot;We are going to welcome them and give them Christian names which breathe the very essence of the true Christian spirit, in the rebellion against the present social order.   But before we produce these ohildren there is another interesting part of our service.   It is an old custom of the Church that when children are brought to baptism that they should have sponsors or god-parents, and their own parents are generally regarded as the best and most suitable of all sponsors.   Whan the parents bring the child to be baptised we know the child cannot thon promise to live the Christian life, and wa are going to catechise the parent   in order to find out whether she really believes in the true principles that underlie the fundaments of Christian belief.   And so we are going tofollow/
follow this 014 ouatoa te-day, and I am going to osteohlsa tho mother of Lenin.    Mro. Mackay - the mother of Lenin :.   I Be Valera and Rosa Luxemburg - is here to-day and she is willing tp be catechised In order that we may judge whether Lenin do Valera end Rosa Luxemburg will really be under good Christian teaching during the time of their youth.   We are going to Vake-one-part,of the catechism whioh speaks of our duty towards our neighbour, and it says our duty is to do our duty in that state of life to which it has pleased &apos; God to call us.   As X look at the state of life I see it is a state of life in whioh the right to live is had by the few.   What is our duty in THAI state of life?  Submission? (voioe from meeting &quot;No.&quot;1)   Rebellion?   (&quot;YesJ&quot;).   And if I can be assured that these children are going to be brought up in a spirit of rebellion against capitalism, then I shall say that both these ohildren are fit to be baptised in the Church of God.   And so X am going to ask the mother.   She has seen life although she is still young.   I am going to ask .-; her to answer my question.   In what way does she think we could best do our duty in that state of life in which it has pleased God to call us? And I believe her answer to my $ question will be given in the form of an address on - &quot;WHYi am a Kami&quot;.Mrs. MaoZay then said:-w...In November 1920, thanks to the Blaok and Tans. lost my left hand, whioh has since been a great draw baok to me.   X do find it very hard, and it would be harder still if I had&apos;t got in my heart that rebellious spirit that teaches mo to rebel until the sooial order shall cease to exist.&quot;*Hio reason why I oall him Lenin is not because I wanlj to be in the fashion, because he is the first Lenin In Great Britain and Ireland, but X, together with his father, determined that it should be colled Lenin.   By the time he grows up I am hoping that the existing social order will bo changed, that Lenin will not be left to starve, and that Lenin will be as proud of his names as his mother and father are.   I oall him Lenin beoause X recognise in him the man of the day.   Beoause 1 recognise in Lenin the greatest man of the day.   Beoause I recognise In that man - not because he is Lonin - but in that man the only man who was able to achieve the greatest reforms.   Lenin, to me,&quot; is the essenoe of everything I wish to live for.&quot;As far as de Valera ie concerned - to my mind de Valera ie not a socialist, and in my opinion will never be a socialist.   He, in ray opinion, in the cause of Ireland end the Movement, is as great a man in his sphere as Lenin. De Valera stands for uncompromising principles...and because of his standing on principle, beoause of the great character of that man, I aaia I shall also add the name of de Valera...&quot;As to Rose luxemberg, she is half a rebel.   She can tell you where Jim Larkln is...    She is in all prospects a rebel.&quot;I intend bringing them up in the wey they should go, and I never intend ray ohlldren to submit (if in my power) to the capitalist system...X want them to grow up in the movement.    I will never allow my children to join theBoy/
If   &amp;p   Ifafter this speech the children were publicly baptised in the usual way:   about 200 were present.The Chief Constable informs toe that as a result of the unemployed disturbances at the offices of the Board of Guardians in Plymouth en June 19th and 26th, George  bury was charged on June  8th with unlawfully inciting divers persons to oonmit a  ; broach of the peace:   he was bound over in the sum of  50, with two sureties of  25 each to be of good behaviour for six months..m YOUBQ COMMUNIST LEAGUEThe following extracts taken from a circular recently sent by the Executive Committee of the Young Coamunist International to the Young Communist league of Great Britain -mmindicates that.Moscow is still far from satisfied with theBritish League:-&quot;Great Britaiq.&quot;The British League is in a very unsatisfactory condition.   After the first successful endeavours of the League last year, a deterioration has started, from the effects of whioh not even the National Executive Coaroittee oould escape (National Executive Committee incapable of carrying out its work.)   The decisions of the Third Congress were adopted and attempts were made to carry them through, but they were unsuccessful.   There is a general laok of system in the work of the League.   Also the paper has deteriorated.   This state is the more deplorable as in most branches healthy elements are working.&quot;to/Boy Seout3 or Girl Guided, or anything that breeds militarism.   For War against War is wrong...I will never bring my child ran up in a school where they will have to walk round the Union Jack and salute it.   Not because it is the Union Jack, hut it represents the capitalist system...&quot;X have been ten times in prison.   What for?    I have never hit a person in my life, or had a row.   I can&apos;t he bothered.   I simply stated the   truth from a public platform...&quot;I shall go away from this Church with a new hope that the day is not far distant when religion (I don&apos;t mean the so-called religion) will shew itself with full force, and it will he a religion that will be worth calling a religion...&quot;
&quot;In the beginning of May the League has carried through a Week of the Unemployed Youth, which dia not effect wide masses.   The present conflict between Great Britain and Russia brought about an enlivement of the League activities.   In June the League Council will take place, which will certainly bring about an improvement of the conditions.   The E.-CU pays great attention to the British League and considers its support as one of its moat important tasks.&quot;jjEOB U^IBMPLOIBDIt is reported that there is a good deal of discontent among the members of the London Committee of the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement, owing partly to dissatisfaction with the national balance sheet.   The Bow and Bromley committee has carried a resolution of.....&apos;!&apos;:&apos;i;&apos;:&apos;(jv;::;disaffiliation, as have the Poplar Committee, the South Lambeth Committee and the North London Area, consisting of Edmonton, Tottenham, Enfield and Ponders End:   in some cases the resolution has not yet been put into operation.     In Caraberwell an anti-communist eoranittee is said to have been formed.THE ORGANISES TOJEVPLOYBD AND THE DOCKERS&apos; STRIKEIt is reported that in London, at least, the NationalUnemployed workers&quot; Committee Movement is actively supporting the dockers who are on strike.     Several meetings were heiayesterday under their auspices.     At a meeting held in   -where the auci:i enoe numbered aboi.it 400 the Bermondsey Town Hall yesterday afternoon/the principalspeakers were &quot;Comrade&quot;H. Martin of the National unemployed workers&apos; Committee Movement, &quot;Comrade&quot;freeman and CharlesHioks, a leading member of the local branch of the BuildingTrades Union.   In the course of his speech Martin statedthat he was an out of work engineer but he realised that the dockers&apos; struggle was a matter that affected all members ofthe/
the working classes, whether employed or unemployed and irrespective of their calling.   He stated that although the officials of the Dockers&apos; Union had declined to back up the men, the National Unemployed Workers1 Committee, of which he was a member, was prepared to run the strike,   The Committee would form committees, composed of unemployed and strikers, and these committees would arrange to carry on propaganda work amongst non-strikers, picketing and to look after the women and children.   Martin advised the men not to worry about what the newspapers published in regard to the stocks of foodstuffs that would rot in the docks if not removed. It did not belong to them and, as they had been used for sometime now to existing at starvation level, to sink a little lower would not matter.   He challenged the cost of living figures of the Board of Trade and declared that they were absolutely inaccurate, averring that, if anything, it was more expensive for the workers to live at the present moment than two or three months ago.     In oonolusion, Martin stated that this strike was part of the struggle that 1b going on between the workers and the capitalist class all over the world.   He exhorted the men  to stand solidly together and to use all reasonable means in their endeavours to persuade their comrades, who had not yet left their work, to join them.   He added that If all persuasion failed it was not necessary for him to tell dockers what other methods to use.Freeman, in the course of his remarks, stated that he was glad that the Dockers had had the courage to come out on strike and had not given way to their employers in the latters&apos; attempt to reduce their standard of living,     All other workers had had to put up with reductions In wagessince/
since that day on which the miners were beaten - the day . they know sb &quot;Black Friday&quot;, and he hoped that this struggle was only the beginning of one that was Boon to take place between all workers, on one side, and capitalists on the other.   It was questionable if the Dockers alone, even if they fought to the fullest&apos;extent of their power, could gain a definite victory, but if they would influence all other transport workers and the miners to join them there would be no doubt that the master class would, in these circumstances, be- brought to their &apos;knees.   He urged the men to stand fast and to force an increase of weges rather than accept a decrease,Freemsjn referred to the remarks made by Martin in regard to the alleged starvation level of living of the workers and said that, if it came to the point, it was unnecessary for the strikers to starve when stocks of food were lying In docks not far from their homes.Hicks in a short speech said that he would support the strikers as far as he possibly could, adding that he had always supported the workers when it came to a struggle between them and their employers.She above three speakers advised the men to force the Bermondsey Board of Guardians to give them relief In view of the fact that they would not be entitled to strike pay from&apos; their union.   They all condemned the attitude taken by Messrs. Ernest Bevin and Harry Gosling and said that thes$ two men should be forced to fall in with the wishes of the strikers.At a subsequent meeting held in Joiners&apos; Street, London Bridge, addresses were delivered by Martin, Freeman, Southwell of the national. Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement, and w. Mortimer, a member of the local branch of the Dockers&apos; Union. Southwell/
Southwell attacked the present system of society and said that if only all the workers were disposed at this moment to support the dockers, it would be possible to wish the workers&apos; republic a &quot;Happy lew Year&quot; at the beginning of 1924.   He urged the men to stand fast.At an evening meeting held under the same auspices in the Bermondsey Town Hall, Southwell said that the strike of the Dockers was the commencement of the human revolution. There was no use sitting idles the fight was now on and they were in it for the complete overthrow of Capitalism and the establishment of the socialist Republic *     The Unemployed organisation had come to the conclusion that the dockers&apos; battle must be theirs.   It was a case of each for all and all for each.   The Dock and Riverside strikers had the full weight of the Unemployed organisation at their backs and he hoped soon to see the Railwaymen and Transport Workers, Miners and Seamen out in sympathy.A resolution from the platform in the following terms was then read:&quot;That this mass meeting of Dock and RiversideWorkers request that Bevan, Gosling and Chureh immediately throw in their lot with the men on strife otherwise they would be asked to tender their re signations.&quot;The resolution was carried without dissent.The ohairman (Martin) then asked for twelve members ofthe Transport Federation to form a strike committee.   he invited those who were willing to serve in that   capacity to go up on the platform.   After much haranguing,entreating, swearing, and cudgelling, nine men mounted the platform end signified their readiness to accept the dutiesof a strike committee.   It was discovered, however, that four or five of those who volunteered wore unemployed menana/
f- nand had nothing to do with the strike.   Thereupon no further action was takon in the direction of forming the committee.   The meeting closed with the singing of the Red Flag.IRISH KBVOIUTIOHiffiY ACTIVITIES IH GRIfiAT BRITAINIrish extremists in Great Britain are extremely quiet for the moment.   The trial of Art 0&apos;Brien and his fellow conspirators was closely watched hut it is too early yet to express an opinion as to the ultimate effept of their conviction.Triers is a revival of the rumours of a secret understanding between Irish extremists here and the communists and, in certain districts of the North and Midlands, there certainly seems to be a close connection. Mcpeak, who was recently arrested in Glasgow and handed over to the Free state authorities on a criminal charge, is said to have been sent here to explore the situation:   he made a tour of the northern area and reported having been well received by Communist friends:   his arrest and return to Ireland has had a disconcerting effect.Many branches of the new Irish Democratic League are being opened up in places where branches of the United Irish League formerly existed, and an appeal forsubscriptions to wipe out the liabilities (sbout  1,000)-I      of the latter organisation is said to be meeting with a ready response.I In Scotland there is a good deal more life in the republican movement.   Countess Markievicz is still well to the fore:   on June 25th she addressed a meeting of communist and Irish extremists at Dumbarton and told them not to be discouraged/
discouraged because the Irish Republican Army were laying down their arms - it was only a ruse to mislead the Free State Government and they were now planning a fresh campaign. Much depended on the Irish people in Scotland to whom she appealed for Funds.Hiss Kathleen Barry of the Irish Republican prisoners Dependents&apos; Fund, is also appealing for help,   she says that in Ireland they are &quot;stranded&quot; for went of money and the Eational Executive Council in Scotland  l&amp; considering the possibility of transferring money collected for other purposes to that fund.
