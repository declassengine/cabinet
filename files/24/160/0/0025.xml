HOME   AFFATPS   COMMITTEEcWORKMEN&apos;S  0 CMPENSATIOK   BILL.Memorandum &quot;by the Home Secretary.This Bill embodies the decisions of the Cabinet in regard to the repeal of the War Addition Aots and alterations cf the bene-fits provided under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Ao-t^l906, It also includes the clause extending the meaning of the words &quot;arising out of&quot; which the Cabinet agreed that I should discuss with the employers1 representatives and raise again at the Home Affairs Committee.     It further contains a number of&apos; provisions of minor or secondary importance, most yf which are based on the reoommendaticns cf the Holman Gregory Committee and are not likely to give rise to serious controversy.Notes on Glauses. Clause 1 repeals the War Addition Aots with a saving for persons already in receipt of the addition,.Clause S. The fallowing examples illustrate the applioa-tioh cf the additional benefit proposed for fatal cases in this clause(l) Where the dependants are a widow and two children of 7 and 14 years of age, and the average weekly earnings of tho deceased workman were 30/-,One child will be 15 in 8 x 52 ^ 416 weeks.

(g) Where the dependants are a widow and 3 children of 1, 7,.  14 irs, and the average weekly earnings were 35/-One child will be 15 in 14 2 52 s 728 weeks.Second &quot;     &quot;       &quot;    &quot;    &quot;    8 x 52 * 416     &quot;   .  $QThird   &quot;     &quot;       &quot;    &quot;    &quot; 58     &quot;1196     &quot;Additional Compensation s 10$ of 35/- x 1196= 10$ of  2093 -  209. Compensation to widow under existing Act 35/- x 156 -  273. Total compensation to dependants - 273 *r 209 s  482. Clause 5,    Subclause (l),   The amount to bo inserted, whether 30/-pr 35/-* is for decision.Subolause (2). The proposal approved by the Cabinet for low wage cases is modified in accordance with a proposal of the amployers as follows;-. Where the weekly allowance is less than 25/-, a weekly addition will be given equal to one-half of the differenco between the weekly allowance and either the sum of 25/- or the average weekly earnings, whichever is the less.     Thus, a workman earning 30/- a week would be ontitled to a weekly allowanoe of 15/- plus 5/- (equals one-half of the difference between the woekly allowance and 25/-) and a workman earning SO/- would be entitled to a weekly allowanee of 10/- plus 5/- (equals one-half the difference botween the weekly allowance and his average weekly earnings).Subolause (5)(a) deals with cases of partial incapacity, At present the proportion of the difference between the pre-accident and post-accidont wages is loft entirely to the arbitrators discre-tijn, but in the great majority of cases the Judges allow the same pro-portion as in total incapacity oases, i.e. 50$, and I propose that this should be fixed by law.    It will be in accordance with the views of the Holman Gregory Committee, and will undoubtedly tend to prevent a good deal of unnecessary litigation.An exception will be -anted for tho low paid cases, where the percentage in total incapacity cases is more than 50$. Sub^olause (3)(b) therefore proposes that in these cases the allowance for partial
inoapacity should bear the same proportion to the workman&apos;s loss of earning capacity as his maximumallowance for total incapacity bore to his pre-accidentearnings.   Thus, a workman earning 30/- before theacoident who receives 15/- plus 5/- ,/hile totallyinaapaoitated, will receive, when he had recoveredcuf f iciently&apos; to earn say 10/-at some light work,1^ x 20 - 13/*.   Again a workman earning 20/-befbre the accident who receives 10/- plus 5/*while totally incapacitated, would receive, when15able to earn say 10/-, ^ x 10 * 7/6.Sub-clause (4) abolishes the provision under which minors whose average weekly earnings were less than 20/- were entitled to reoeive 100$ of their earnings up to a maximum of 10/-.   These cases will now be dealt with under the special provisions for the low paid workers.Clause 4 is important.   At present compensation is payable only where the incapacity lasts more than one week, but is dated back to the day of the accident if the incapacity lasts two weeks or over.   These provisions have worked very badly as they have constituted a strong inducement to the workman to stop off over the 14 days, and the Committee unanimously recommended that a waiting period of three days with no dating back should be adopted.   This ooincides with the rule in the National Health Insurance and. will therefore be of administrative convenience.Clause 5.   This is consequential on the preceding provisions^
Ciause 6.   I find that the employers&quot; representatives are perfectly prepared to aooept some amendment in regard to the words &quot;arising out of the employment&quot; on the lines proposed in this clause, but they urged that in disablement dases compensation should not be payable in.the cases covered by the Clause if the accident was attributable to the serious and wilful mieoonduct of the workman.   I prefer myself the clause as drafted in consultation with the Attorney General but with the addition of the words shown in square brackets which the draughtsman considers necessary.Clause 7 brings share fishermen -subject to exceptions -within the Act.   At present fishermen who receive a share in the earnings of the vessel are outside the Act, even if they are paid a weekly wage and the share forms only quite a small part of their remuneration.   This position is quite indefensible and in the case of some sections of the industry the owners have recognised this by paying compensation voluntarily.The Committee recommended that the Act should be amended to include trawler fishermen who are all, with the possible exception of the skipper and mate, in the position of ordinary &quot;workmen&quot; within the meaning of the Act.   in the caBe of the herring and other kinds of fishing the position is different.   Much of this, especially in Scotland, is carried on by members of the same family and cannot be brought under the Act.   In other oases, e.g. the English herring fishing, the conditions approximate to those of the trawlers. The Committee accordingly suggested that power should be taken after public inquiry to make OrderB applying the Act to any such classes of fishermen (see paragraph 46 of Report),The Government Departments interested have been consult-ed and It appears to be generally agreed that the men on the traw-lere and on the English drifters ought to be brought under the Actbut
that where the boat is worked more or less as a family affair and the persons working it are really in the position of co-partners or co-adventurers, the Act should not apply,I agree with this view but it is not altogether easy to give effect to it.   I think the method least open to objection would be to follow the method adopted in the National Health insurance Act) 1911^ and apply the Aot to fishermen generally, but to take power to make Orders excepting any particular classes of fishermen.Clause 8 makes certain minor extensions of the Aot proposed by the Committee,   instances are (a) the London taxi-cab drivers, (b) the golf caddie,   (c) the bandsmen who went down on&apos;the Titanic.Clause 9 amends the law as to the notice to be given by the workman of his accident.    It is based substantially on the Committee&apos;s recommendations but it is not proposed to accept their suggestion that the onus of proving &quot;prejudice&quot; should be transferred from the workman to the employers   As a result of decisions of the House of Lords the onus now laid on the workman is a very light one - he is not called upon to establish the negative proposition that the employer is not prejudiced, but merely to give evidence from which this may reasonably by   i inferred,Clause 10 is important,,    It   anables a reference to be made to the medical referee as to the workman&apos;s condition at the instance of either party, instead of only - aB at present - on their joint applications    This was unanimously recommended by the Committee, as also the minor alterations in sub-clause (2) - see paragraph 35 of ReportsClause 11 is based on the unanimous recommendations of the Committee.Sub-clauses (l) and (2) give the County Court further powers with a view to the prevention of improvident agreements.
-6- - -especially lump sum agreements,   sub-clause (3) seeks to prevent settlements which provide for the payment of excessive costs to the workman&apos;s solicitor to the prejudice either of the workman or if the employer.Sub-clause (4) recognises the interest of tho approved societies in settlements for compensation and is strongly urged by the Ministry of Health.   It will be noted that the Bill does not contain any provisions on the lines recommended in paragraphs 83 and 84 of the Report   for making all lump sum agreements subject to the approval of the County Court,   A recent decision of the House of Lords has over-ruled the previous decisions of the Court of Appeal on the subject and the law is now declared to be what the Committee desired it should be.Clause Iff gives effect to a recommendation of the Committee.   At present in the case of industrial disease the workman must get a certificate from the Certifying Surgeon, even In cases where he has come to an agreement with his employer as to compensation, - should he not do so - and should he afterwards have a dispute with his employer as to his condition or otherwise, he cannot maintain any claim in the Court.   The clause would allow him to do bo where there has been such an agreement.Clause 13 carries out a recommendation of the Committee and of the Court of Appeal and explains itself.Clause 14.&apos; Sub-clause (l) removes a defect in the drafting of the present Act. The workman is protected when a Company is wound up, but not when the debenture holders take possession.Sub-clause (g) gives the claims of a workman for compensation priority up to the full amount due instead of only to the extent of  100.The Board of Trade concurs in these proposals. Clause 15.    Section 11 of the Act of 1906 gives certain powers to Courts of Record, in cases where the owners of a ship owned abroad appear liable to pay compensation, to issue Orders for the
detention of a ship until the compensation has been paid or security given.   It has frequently been the subject of complaint to the Home Office by Deputations from the Trades Union Congress that in these cases the ship often leaves this country before an Order can be obtained from a Court and to meet this complaint it is proposed to give the Secretary State summary powers for the detention of the ship for such time as will allow application to be made to the Court.   This procedure which has been settled in consultation with the Board of Trade is based on the provisions of the Merchant Shipping (Stevedores and Trimmers) Act, 1911.Clause 16.   This carries out a recommendation of the Committee. Olause 17.   This clause has been inserted at the instan.ce of the Scottish Board of Health and with the concurrence of tho Ministry of Health.   Its object is to provide an easier method whereby a Poor Law Authority may secure repayment of out-door relief granted to a workman pending the settlement of his claim to compensation.    Somewhat similar provisions in regard to repayment of advances are contained in the Unemployment and National Health Insurance Acts.Olause 19.   It is proposed, after consultation with the Treasury, that the feeB of Medical Referees under the provisions referred to in the clause should bo borne by the applicant - that is to say in the bulk of cases by the employer - instead of being paid as previously from the Home Office Vote.   This should result in a substantial saving of public expenditure. Clause 20.   The proposal in this clause is to assimilate the standards for the payment of compensation under the Compensation Act and for the notification of accidents under the Factory and other Acts.   It is thought that such an assimilation of the law will be a relief to employers, will result in a much better notification of accidents, and will increase the usefulness of the accident and compensation statistics as they will be
9G.180-7.compiled on the same basis.The question of the extension of this clause to mines and quarries is under the consideration of the Mines Department. Clause 81*   This clause is based on the recommendations of the Committee in paragraph 76 of Report.   Its effect is to require provision to be made for first aid treatment of accidents at all factories - as is at present required by Home Office Orders under the Police, Factories, &amp;o.  (Miscellaneous Provisions) Aot, 191$, in the engineering, woodworking and other industries - and to empower the Home Office to extend these requirements to docks and other premises to which the provisions of the Act of 1916 do not at present apply.   By ensuring immediate treatment for injuries and helping to prevent small injuries from becoming serious through infection, the provision should have a beneficial effect both on the charges to the employer and the efficiency of the worker.w.
