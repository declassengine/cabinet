The Committee decided to. recommend, as regardslegislation:   that the best plan would be not to have a Government Bill and as regards Sir Arthur Shirley Eenn-&apos;s Bill that no facilities should be given by the Government unless the Bill emerged, from.

SUffllNG 6.     (a) That on Rule 3 in the Schedule (which requires a mechanical stunning instrument) the Government should move to omit the words &quot;and approved by the Minister of Health on the advice of an expert Committee appointed by him&quot; on the ground that in the present state of knowledge it was better to leave &quot;suitability&quot; and &quot;sufficiency&quot; to bo   determined as a matter of fact, thus following the model byolaw which had been approved by the High C court.(b) That In Committee it should be stated that, while the Minister was not prepared to accept a
statutory obligation to prescribe the stunning instrument, he was willing to appoint an Expert Committee and on receiving their conclusions to comnunicate them to local authorities.(c ) That if the meat traders urged that this Expert Committee should consider not merely the &quot;suitability and sufficiency&quot; of the instrument but its effects upon che meat, the answer of the Government should be that the Export Committee would be at liberty to receive any information which was sent to it, but it would only be set up after the principle that there should be a mechanical stunning instrument had been accepted by Parliament, and therefore that the only business of tho Committee would be to consider which of various instruments was moat &apos; suitable .III.IH) GENERAJ&apos;..- The Committee have received a large amount ofUIRY.evidence on the subject of the use of mechanical stunning Instruments in slaughterhouses, including representations from the National Federation of Moat Traders Associations, and others, in favour of a general enquiry into the whole question.    They have decided that they are not prepared&apos; to recommend the Government to institute such an enquiry. The questions arising on model bye-law 9.B. (which if adopted by a local authority make-3 mechanical stunning instruments compulsory) had already been fully explored and - whilst a Committee could be accepted, for tho limited purposes of Rule 3 In the Schedule to the Bill (see 11(6) (b) and (c) above - it would not be accepted in a form, which would re-open the whole question, as suggested by the meat trade.Signed on behalf of the Committee,..NEVILLE CH/MBEELAIB Chairman.24th f&apos;ay,lP23:.
