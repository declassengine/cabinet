OJR0ULATED.TO THE CABINET, t is &amp;e Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s- Government.][June 13.Section 1.[C 10272/1/18]No. 1.The Marquess Curzon o.f Kedleston to Count de Saint.AiUairq.L3, H&apos;23Your Excellency, Foreign Office, - tuneHIS Majesty&apos;s Government have given their careful attention to the communica.-. tion which your Excellency made to me verbally on the- 11th instant on the subject of. the fresh proposals for a settlement pf the question of reparation put forward by the German Government.2. These proposals, your Excellency informed me, the French Government could proceed to discuss with their Allies only after German passive resistance in the Ruhr had ceased a condition the fulfilment of which it is accordingly suggested that the British Government should join their Allies in demanding from the German Govern-, ment. An aide-memoire which your Excellency was good enough to hand to me at the same time set out a brief statement of principles on which the French Government declare they will be guided in entering upon a discussion of the German proposals. They are the following: (i.) Passive resistance having ceased, the occupation of the Ruhr wrould continue, but under altogether different conditions, and with the co-operation of German organisations, (ii.) France can sacrifice no part of her share of the A. and B Bonds, but would agree to give up a portion of 0 Bonds, which could be employed for the payment of the inter-Allied debts, (iii.) The French Government recognise that Germany needs a certain time for balancing her budget; but, having lost no part of her riches, Germany should be able to hand over to the Allies a certain part of such of her resources as can be immediately realised, viz.: (1.) The railways on the left bank of the Rhine, which could be handed over to a company in which France, Belgium, Great Britain and even the Rhmeland would hold shares. (2.) Certain &quot;coal-mines in the Ruhr, appropriated by the German Reich, which might be handed over under similar conditions to an inter-allied company. (3.) Deliveries in kind, to be specified.(4.) The yield of the customs duties, which might at once be leviedin gold or gold values and placed at the disposal of the Allies. (5.) Lastly, a certain proportion of the foreign exchange resulting from the sales of certain important exports, which would, in conformity with the principles accepted by Germany herself, be handed over to the Allies, the levy of the 26 per cent, being adjusted to Gennany&apos;s economic requirements..(iv.) In. the occupied territories it would be for the Allies themselves to collect the ceded revenues.3. In considering the several issues raised by your Excellency&apos;s communication, His Majesty&apos;s Government find themselves confronted with a number of difficulties arising from animperfect understanding of the precise import of some of the French propositions. I am accordingly charged by my Government to beg that they may be favoured with fuller particulars on the following points : What is the exact meaning attached by the French Government to the demand or the cessation of passive resistance?   Is it a demand for the withdrawal of ail enactments or orders directly emanating from the German Government by which their people are enjoined to refuse the payment of taxes to the French authorities or to abstain from rendering to the latter services due to the German administration, such s the running of railways ?   Or is it suggested that the French Government will [326 n-1]
decline .to. discuss the reparation problem so long as individual inhabitants,: or groups of inhabitauts,-o .;.the--.Ruhj-;&apos;,or;other;recently occupied regions ;decline to work for French officials or employers, or manifest disapproval of the - occupation and ol the steps which have been.taken: by the French authorities in consequence ? ,,4. -From the wording of the aide-memoire which your Excellency handed to me, it would, almost seem as if the cessation of passive resistance was: regarded by the French Government as equivalent to active co-operation of the. German population in whatever measures, coercive or other, the French, authorities may see lit to take or order. This would be an excessive and an impracticable demand, even if it were conceded that French action in the Ruhr was justified and authorised under the Treaty of Versailles..5. If, on the other hand, the French Government were to be content with the revocation by the German Government of all measures enjoining the duty of passive resistance, is it to be understood that such revocation would be followed by the return of the evicted and imprisoned population to their homes and the restoration of their properties ?6. His Majesty&apos;s Government further note that whilst they are asked to call upon Germany to undertake that passive resistance whatever interpretation be given to that term shall cease, nothing is said as to the inducements to be held out to her to yield on the point. Apparently all she is to expect as the price for her submission is that the occupation will continue, her own people co-operating for this purpose. How long then is the occupation to continue ? And in what form ? Is it to remain a purely military occupation ? Or will it, perhaps by stages, assume the character of a police protection V Or, again, is it proposed to submit the territory to actual exploitation by or on behalf of France and Belgium, as would seem to be implied by the suggestion that it will be for the Allies themselves to collect the revenues to be made over to them in the occupied territories ?     .7. All these are points on which His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to be perfectly clear before considering whether they can contemplate the possibility of approaching the German Government in some way on the subject of passive resistance. But clearness on this point is not enough; the French Government themselves have repeatedly declared, that the occupation of the Ruhr, which it is now sought to stabilise by eliminating Gerinany&apos;s passive resistance, is only a means to an end. The end is the payment of reparations. If the position be viewed in this light, a definite plan for settling the whole reparation question in a manner that can be accepted as practical and equitable by all parties imposes itself as a first necessity^so soon as the stage of the cessation of all resistance to the occupation has been reached. It would obviously be of the greatest advantage that the plan should be ready. The knowledge that it is available would offer the strongest inducement to the German Government to cease passive resistance.8. Your Excellency&apos;s aide-memoire offers, it is true, some: indications of the views of the French Government as regards some features of such a plan. Unfortunately, these indications are neither very precise, nor do they cover more than a small part of the ground. His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome further particulars and explanations.9. The proposal that whatever happens, France&apos;s share of the value represented by the A and B Bonds shall remain intact, implying that any necessary adjustments consequent upon a revised estimate of Germany&apos;s capacity to pay shall be made at the expense of others, and the suggestion that France should be allowed to liquidate her inter-Allied debts by the surrender of her share of C Bonds revive, in general outline, proposals which the British Government felt unable to accept in January last, and do not appear to them now to afford a practical economic basis of settlement.10. Again, whilst the necessity of granting a moratorium to Germany is recognised, this recognition is coupled with conditions as to immediate and continued payments and deliveries which, at first sight, seem to render the moratorium itself nugatory. Perhaps this impression can be corrected by fuller explanations which the French Government may be able to give as to the system contemplated for the operation by inter-Allied companies of the railways and mines in occupied territory; as tb the nature and amount of the proposed deliveries in kind; as to the customs duties to be attached by the Allies, wdiether on the frontiers of the whole German Reich or merely on the frontiers of the occupied areas; and lastly, as to the proposed arrangements respecting foreign exchange representing the value of exported special products and the consequential adjustments concerning the 26 per cent, tax, the reference to which in your Excellency&apos;s note is not clearly understood.
11. In&apos;i any case, air estimate of the actual amoimt which the French Government anticipate might be realised -annually by the Allies from;.. these various resources:.would facilitate a correct appreciation of the economic situation.:.- i -v:;w,V:. J12. In asking your Excellency to invite your Government to: favour His ^Majesty&apos;s Government with explanations to elucidate the several points to which I have had the honour to call attention, I desire to give expression to their, earnest&apos;hope that, by entering into a full and frank discussion of the important questions at issue, our two Governments will pave the way to the early re-establishment of that complete harmony of views and of action which it is their most sincere wish to promote and to maintain.I have, &amp;c.CURZON OF KEDLESTON.
