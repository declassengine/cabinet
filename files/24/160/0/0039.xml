COMMUNISTSOn May 2nd Thomas Bell, the political secretary of the Communist Party circulated to District Comittees the &quot;statement on the Parliamentary Activity of the Communist Party v&amp;ich wag prepared recently by the Presidium of the Communist International&quot; and a letter from Kuusinen regarding the policy of the Communist party towards the labour Pttrty.    These documents are of the utmost importance as evidence of Russian propaganda in this country:   the first was quoted in Report 196 and the test of the second ie as follows&quot;NO. 762.&quot;The Executive Committee of the Communist InternationalMoscow,26th March, 1.923.&quot;To the Central Committeeof the Communist Party of Great Britain,Thomas Ball, Political Secretary,&quot;Dear Comrades,&quot;In your letter to the Secretariat dated Feby. 16th you ask for our views regarding the wisdom of the policy of sharpening the criticism of the labour party, in vie v.&quot; of your continued demands for affilia-tion.   This with reference particularly to the activities of Comrade- Newbold.&quot;As stated in the resolution of the presidium outlining the Parliamentary activity of the communist party of Great Britain, the whole policy of affiliation to the Labour Pert;/ was dictated purely because of the peculiar character of that organisation.Its Federal character precludes its being designated a party in the common sense of the term end the basis for affiliation to it presented opportunities to the party which do not exist in any other country.&quot;The Tendency, however, on the part of the labour party to exact such conditions of affiliation as would msan the repudiation of the communist international, and the sterilising of our right of criticism, can only be met by just such a policy as the Presidium has decided upon.     our policy of demanding affiliation should be persisted in particularlyamongst/
amongst the masses which, make up the labour party in&apos; order either to force affiliation or to reveal the real character of the labour party:   on the other hand our reason for counselling a sharpening of the criticism is to avoid any misunderstanding as to the exact relationship of the party to the labour party.   The    , struggle towards affiliation should make clear that although admitted we are a distinct body, with a distinct policy and therefore our full right of criticism should under no oireumstances be impaired. In the event of an ultimate definite rejection this policy would still have made eminently clear the&apos; differences both in policy and in character of the two bodies and would redound to the good of the party,&quot;The Party is an independent party with an Independent policy.and this we should always make clear to the masses both by the. character of our programme and our criticism, so that in time they will come to understand the party and the object it has in view.With fraternal greeting, O.W. Xuusinen,&quot; The contents of these documents are to be made &quot;as widely known as possible&apos;&apos; among members of the communists Party.It is reported that the Communist Party of Canada hasreceived a circular from the Executive Committee of theComintern in which occurs the following passage which hasreference to the forthcoming meeting of the Enlarged. Sessionof the Executive in Moscow:&quot;In spite of the fact that Great Britain occupies a very important position in world affairs, political and industrial, the Cormunist Party of Great Britain has not progressed.   It must bo- brought to tho front, in the seme way as the German Party, and latterly, as the French pK^ty.   The 0.*B:. of O.B. will r amain on the agenda of the Executive of the Communist International until some great victory is won.&quot;The Executive Committee of the Communist International has decided that, as J.T. Murphy was recently in Russia, he shall not attend the Enlarged Session which begins on May 20th.Robert Stewart was in Berlin on May 2nd and expected to leave for Moscow almost immediately.

This is also being done by other groups.&quot;communists/u 0 &quot; .his wife were also in Berlin on the seme date but expected to be detained for a few days as instructions regarding the wifeTs admission to Russia had not been received.The Sub-Committee of the Communist Party which is conoemed with propaganda among railwayman has asked for a return of all conmunlets vflio are employed on the railways with .a view to co-ordinating their activity.The sales of &quot;The Workers&apos; Weekly&quot; appear to be but of proportion to the actual number of communists in this country:   the Hornsey Looal Party committee, for instance, which is numerically weak, effected the following sales during March:
&quot;* 4rCQMMUHISTS AND THE NOTE 3D russia the dispatch of the Note to Soviet Russia has given riseto exceptional activity in communist as well as in extremelabour circles.-    On May 4th the following secret circularwas issued by the political Bureau of the Communist Partyto the District Party Committees and unattached locals:&quot;The Executive Committee had under consideration last night, important information with reference to the developing attack upon Soviet Russia by the British Government.   The British note, we are informed, is deliberately intended to provoke a rupture, and rupture we know of old, means war.    We have accordingly sent the following telegram to all District Party Ccmmittees:-&quot;Make most powerful agitation against British Government&apos;s provocative note to RusbIs.   Situation exceedingly serious.   Commence agitation at once amongst Labour organisations for the formation of Councils of Action.   Demand All-in National Conference of Labour organisations.   Slogans:   Stand by the Trade Agreement,   Immediate and unconditional reoogniti on of soviet Russia.   Summoning of en immediate Peace Conference with Russia to settle points of difference.   Down with war on the Workers&apos; Republic&quot;All our agitation must now be related to this situation,&quot;We would warn you against any artificial creation of Councils of Action.   Any Councils that are set up must be representative of the broad mass organisations of the workers and not confined to small cliques. They must be an expression of the United front on this issue of preventing the closing down of the Trade Delegation and developing the antagonism leading to open war.   Our campaign must be a developing campaign, Time must elapse pending reply from Russia which will be amply used by the opposition and which we must use also to the utmost.&apos;7IThe Workers&apos; Weekly&apos; will give special attention to this question this week and we will send out special notes during the next few days,&quot;In the Metropolitan area this circular was followed up by another Issued by the London organiser on May 7th, the test of which was:-&quot;To Trades Councils, Labour Parties, Trade Unions, Unemployed Committees, socialist arid Communist Parties,&quot;Dear Comrades,&quot;The Labour press has made well-known to us allthe/
the campaign which is now on with a view to cancelling the trade agreement with Russia, and perhaps involving the workers in another war.   If such a step is taken by the Government it will not only give encouragement to the Militarists of all Capitalist countries, but it will also intensify the economic disorder which is prevalent to-day, and which results in so many workers being unemployed and lends power to the employees in their attacks upon the standard of those who are workings     Only a vigorous all-in working class protest will stop the government from taking this disastrous step against the workers.   The Communist party with other working class organisations is going to play its part in organising the workers protest.   We do not stand alone as sectarians in this matter,   We invite the co-operation of all workers.   We render assistance to the endeavours of others.   We are arranging to hold a series of five Mass demonstrations on Sunday nest, May 15th, in the following placesVictoria park at 6 p,m,Pinsbury Park &quot; 7 p.m.Peckhem Rye &quot; 6 p.nuparliament Hill &quot; 8,30 p*m.Clephsm Common &quot; 11..sum.We invite the members of all the above organisations to rally to these demonstrations-;   Wo ask them to see that their trade union banners are present.   We ask the labour Parties and Trades Councils each to appoint two speakers for the demonstration in their locality. Bead me immediately the names end addresses of the chosen speakers so that they can be advertised.    The Unemployed and other organisations will have representative speakers.     If your organisation is not mooting this woek call an emergency meeting of your Executive to consider what can be done.   It is urgent. If you delay the Government m&amp;y act before Labour can effectively voice its protest.&quot;The Executive of the Communist party has also issued a manifesto&quot;Form Coupe ils of Action] Force Recognition HowJ&apos;JTo All Workers&quot;The British Government is again leading the capitalist offensive against the workers&apos; Republic of Russia.   From the first days of the revolution whan the working class came into power, the capitalists of all countries have unceasingly attacked the Soviet Republic.   By plots within Russia, by. military expoditions, by blockade, by sabotage, they have continually striven to destroy every effort of the workers to emerge from the chaos created by the capitalist class,&quot;Up to now they have failed to defeat the workers of Russia,   By wonderful heroism and. mighty deeds withinthe/
the workers&apos; Re public, by tremendous agitational action of the workers outside Russia, the workers&apos; Republic has won viotory after victory.   It has emerged from chaos, and the capitalist governments have been compelled to open trade relations and make trade agreement s.&quot;But the capitalist governments have never ceased their enmity or wavered in their intention to crush the workers,   Encouraged by the heavy defeats they have inflicted upon the workers in their own countries they deem the time is ripe to open a new offensive against the Workers1 Republic.   For weeks they have tried to stimulate every popular passion against Russia.   Ard now, on the pretext of persecution of religion, on the arrest of British trawlers for breaking Russian law, on tho pretext of Communist propaganda and strong language from the Russian workers&apos; Government for interference in Russian affairs, they are sending a provocative Note to Russia with a view to breaking off trade relations and setting the dogs of reaction loose in Europe to provoke war on Russia.&quot;The charge of persecution of religion is a proven lie.   The priests were tried and found guilty of tho political crime of treason,   would the British Government let an English Bishop go free if proven guilty of giving information to the German Government during the war?   You know they would not.   neither can the workers permit treason against their Government,     Will the British Government permit foreign trawlers In declared British waters?   You know they would not.   Will the British capitalists stop their counter-revolutionary propaganda in the workers1 organisations of all countries?   $ou know they will, not,   will the British Government permit foreign representatives to protest against its judicial trials in this country?   You know they will not.&quot;The whole of the pretexts for this new campaign are utterly worthless.   It means they hate the Russian workers as they hate you.   They know that the growth of trade with Russia means strengthening the worker&apos;s movement throughout the world,&quot;Once we stopped war on Russia by a united movement in the Councils of Action.   Once again the hour has oome to prevent war, for the closing down of the Russian Trade Delegation here is the first step to war.   Once again we must act quickly.   Get together and form the United Front in the Councils of Action.   Give the call for an All-in Conference of the organisations of the working class.   Get ready for action!&quot;Hands off the Trade Delegation? &quot;Make Peace with RussiaJ&quot;M?ike the British Government unconditionallyrecognise Soviet RussiaJ &quot;Up with the Councils of Action.&apos; &quot;Down with war on the Workers&apos; Republic 1 &quot;Workers, Unite I&quot;The Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain.&quot;
A labour demonstration is to be held in Trafalgar Square on Sunday next, May 13th, &quot;to protest against the threatened breach of the trade agreement with Russia, to denounce any new war, to proclaim the solidarity of the working people, and to demand the complete and unconditional recognition of the Russian Government.&quot;m REP IH TERNATIONAL OP LABOUR UNIONSThe British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unlong is, in common with the Communist P^rty devoting special attention to the note to Russia and is urging the formation of Councils .of isction.The organisation of coloured seamen to which reference was made in a previous report has taken the form of the &quot;International Oriental Seafarers&apos; Union&quot;:    S. Saklatvala, M.P., is president and p,B. Dinda, general secretary.   This union is affiliated with the Red International of labour Unions and last week an attempt was made to spread the organisation to South Wales ports through the radium of a leading communist official in Cardiff.Nat Watkins, Tom Mann, H*rry Pollitt and J.R. Campbell have been summoned to Moscow to attend the International meeting which begins on June 1st:   it is, however, doubtful if Tom Mann will&apos;go.gS YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUEThe Executive of the Young Communist league of GreatBritain has again been reprimanded by Moscow for its lackof success:     in a secret communication dated Mosoow,April 23rd, 19.23, the Executive of the Young CommunistInternational declared that:&quot;It appears that neither the League as a whole nor the individual branches are carrying on a systematic activity on the basis of the decisions oftha/
the last congress,.   Nor oan we perceive any earnest endeavours to penetrate into the masses of the working class youth and into the shops, to raise the question of the economic representation of the former and to establish, trade union fractions and shop nuclei...&quot;The industrial disputes whioh are going on at present in England (agricultural workers, builders, railwaymen) should also be utilized by you to show the working class youth in these Industries involved in the struggle the necessity of participating in the struggles oi adult labor.   You Bhould furthermore seize upon this ocoaslon to formulate concrete demands for the young workers in those industries, those demands to he advocated by yourselves, the pi,rty and tho trade unions.   You must in this respect strive to follow the example set by your German and French comrades...&quot;Charles Redfern, organiser of the Young CommunistLeague of Great Britain, has returned from the BerlinBureau to resume his duties at LwiVq Conduit street.THB TfliiaflpLOYSDThe National political Secretary of the communist Party has severely taken to task District party Committees and unattaohed looals for their failure to secure the adoption of a communist &quot;lead&quot; at the reoent Coventry conference of &apos; the National Unemployed Workers1 Committee Movement.In the course of a lengthy circular this official statesthat j&quot;Party members must learn to establish themselves in the Unemployed Movement by work for the unemployed rather than by talking down to the unemployed from a sectarian platform.   This question of presenting our oase for any resolution is a serious one.   We hope to improve matters by constant supply of outlines of speeches on the various issues and we ask the D.P. Committees to see to it that they are used.   We are anxious for the party to beoone not only reputed for its proposals but also for the correctness of the exposition of our oase as the oase for the workers.&quot;Ia order that a central lead may be gifen regularly and contact with D.P. Committees and groups may be regularly maintained, a special leading committee attaohed to the Politioal Bureau has been established to deal specifically with unemployed questions.&quot;It is urgent therefore that this committee should have its counterpart in the local and district party organisations, and that the D.p.0. committees seeto/
-t 9 -*to it that-Communist Huelei are established and work regularly in the application of the Forty lead a..&apos;&quot;The resolutions which are of the greatest significance and importance from the conference, were:-(ill - Recognition of Soviet Russia and the granting of long term credits.(&amp;)   The resolution reading &quot;This Conference demands that Unomployad Rwlief he a national charge on the national Exchequer, the administration through the Trade Unions&quot; - (This was carried by 62 to 43).. (3)&apos; The resolution re the National Hunger Maroh*(4)   The resolution on the &quot;Ail-in&quot; Conference and the General Strike.(5)   The resolution re &quot;Rent and Rates Strike&apos;.&quot;It is important that resolution N0.1. be subject to a vigorous campaign especially in view of the newspaper ramp and threats to send away the Russian Trade Delegation.   Vie are therefore supplying you herewith the speakers notes and information re Russian Trading Agreement etc., from the &quot;Hsnds off Russia1 Committee.   Also notes and information relative to the prosecution of church dignitaries who have been acting as counter revolutionary spies etc.&quot;Hsnnington has gone to Russia and his place as national organiser is being temporarily taken by Tom McKay of ManohestereMAY day from reports received, from Chief Constables it appears that the attendance at May Day demonstrations was, in practically all districts, much smaller than last year despite the faot. that the meetings were in many oases held on Sunday, ifoy &quot;6th in order that the workers might not have the excuse of being unable to leave their employment.The resolutions passed and speeches made were all very much of the same pattern:   necessity for the unification of labour in opposition to capital was stressed:   the Versailles Treaty, the Government attitude towards Russia and the occupation of the Ruhr were generally condemned and in many cases the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; ;ms advertised.   The only speech reported which seems worthy of mention was made by Mr. ThomasHenderson/
Henderson, M.P., at Birkenhead. .   He said that as a socialist he was firmly of opinion that the desired state of things would never he brought about without the spilling of blood.   There were several politicians who must go, such as the men who defied Mr. asquith when he introduced the Irish Home Rule Bill, and raised an Army in Ulster to fight the British Government.     The workers would have to learn to use the weapons and the machines that were turned against them.Wherever possible communists participated in labour demonstrations and meetings:   where this could not be managed &apos;thoy held independent gatherings.IEISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IH GREAT BRITAINIt is Baid by people who are usually well informed that unofficial communications are passing between the free State Government and certain Republican leaders, although open negotiations are out of the question:   what is expected is something in the naturo of e. declaration cf policy hy both sides resulting in an undertaking to allow a free election in the autumn.   A few unimportant men and spitfire women of the school teacher type are the only ones left to keep the Republican Flag flying here;     their followers are mainly young men and women more interested in sport ana amusement than anything else.The few concerts and other social events organised for the purpose of raising funds have baen a distinct failure, barely paying expenses.   The London Committee is not working at all well together and money is very scarce.In Liverpool tfca new Thomas ashe Republican Club elected sifter the round up in March, is still functioning, although the attendance at meetings is small.   De Valera&apos;s &quot;cease-fire&quot; order was discussed at a recent meeting when it web decided that whatever happened, the Thomas Ashe Club would keep onfighting/
fighting until Ireland was gfanted a &quot;Free and Full Republic&quot;:   there were thirteen men and nine women at this meeting.-The lecture delivered by Father Qninlan on May 6th in aid of the Dependents Funa at St. Martins Hall, Liverpool, was a failure.In Glasgow things are not much better, the failure of Madame M*;ris:ievio:2&apos;s meeting, referred to in last week&apos;s report, has given rise to a very bitter discussion,   Liam Travere, the acting-organiser, is blamed for introducing &quot;class politics&quot; on to an Irish platform.   The National Executive Council, a self-elected body, taking the place of those removed by deportation, is also being criticlfed. The Special Ceilihds (social Gatherings) held in Shdtl^nd on behalf of the Prisoners&apos; Daf&amp;nce Pund, have been financially unsuccessful.
