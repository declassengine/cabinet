Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1923.SECRET. V.1&apos;&apos;       ... . ::iCP. 270 (23).(Also C.I.D.&apos;Paper No. N.D. -40.)CABINET.NATIONAL AND IMPERIAL DEFENCE SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Interim Report.IN view of the menacing position already revealed by their investigations, the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the Co-operation and Correlation between the Navy, Army and Air Force deem it necessary, without, waiting for the completion of their Inquiry, to present an Interim Report on Item (C) of their Terms of Reference, namely: *&quot; The standard to be aimed at for defining the strength of the Air Force for purposes of Home and Imperial Defence.&quot; &apos;The Menace.2.. In this Paper attention is drawn to France only, because at the present momefit she is the strongest Air Power. France possesses at the present time a total -of about 1,200 first-line aeroplanes, of which 232 are stationed overseas and 946 in France. Of the latter, about 600 are organised as an Independent Air Force, capable of being used to attack this country. In a war between Great Britain and France these 600 machines might, in certain eventualities, be reinforced from the squadrons allotted to the Army, and the Air Ministry estimate that a total of 866 machines might be utilised for the purpose of attacking the British Isles, unless France was simultaneously engaged or menaced on some other front.Against this, after meeting the needs of the Navy, we have fifty-two first-line machines, available for Home Defence (of which only twenty-four are at this moment in these Islands), together with twenty-four machines attached to the Army. Fifteen additional squadrons, with a total eventual strength of 172 additional machines, are in process of formation, but under present arrangements will not be completed before 1925.3. The French Government contemplate an increase in their Air Forces which will bring them up to a strength of 2,180 first-line machines, of which 1,868 will be in France and 312 overseas. The evidence is still uncertain whether this programme will be carried out, but, in any event, some years must elapse before it can be completed.4. The menace to Great Britain, and more especially to London, by the existing disparity between the Air Forces of France and Great Britain was described in the following extract from a Memorandum submitted to the late Government by Lord Balfour on the 29th May, 1922 :-&quot; If we had to depend solely on anti-aircraft guns and other land defences, the French Air Force at their present strength, or, to be precise, at the strength they would possess after a rapid mobilisation, would enable them to drop on London a continuous torrent of high explosives at the rate of 75 tons a day for an indefinite period. When it is remembered that in the worst German raid only 3 tons were dropped on London, and that every raid was separated from its successor by a considerable interval of time, the overwhelming seriousness of the [10141 a][This JDocBment is the Property of his ^ritanEic^Majesty&apos;s Government.]
situation thus revealed must be obvious to all. Day after day, and night after night, the capital of the Empire would be subject to an unremitting bombard-ment of a kind which no city effectively acting as the Military, Naval and Administrative centre of a country engaged in a life-and-death struggle has ever had to endure. The War Office and the Admiralty would be paralysed by the destruction of the material instruments which are necessary for the conduct of their business. Lines of communication would be cut, and London would be uninhabitable probably in fact, certainly in the opinion of those who now dwell there.&quot; I say nothing about the arsenals, dockyards and defended harbours, nor about the shipping crowded in the Port of London, for the details of the picture which I have just outlined are easily filled in.&quot;Such was the situation in May 1922. It is now slightly worse. According to the latest calculations of the Air Ministry, the French could, unless opposed by an adequate Air Force, drop 168 tons of bombs on England during the first twenty-four hours, 126 tons during the second twenty-four hours and 84 tons for each succeeding twenty-four hours, for an indefinite period. That is to say, the weight of bombs that could now be dropped on London in a single day is almost as great as the total weight of bombs that was dropped in England during the whole war.5. Of the 232 machines possessed by France overseas, 180 are stationed in North Africa. In time of war these must constitute a source of positive menace, both to Gibraltar and to the movements of British shipping in and out of the Mediterranean.In these circumstances, in a war with France it might be necessary to divert for a time the bulk of our shipping from the Mediterranean to the Cape route.6. The military consequences of such a situation are sufficiently obvious. The diplomatic disadvantages, if allowed to continue, must be very serious.7. The Committee consider the matter so urgent, and the necessity of taking-prompt steps to remedy the situation so essential, as to warrant them in immediately submitting the following recommendations :- (1.) In addition to meeting the essential Air power requirements of the Navy, Army, Indian and overseas commitments (in regard to which a Report will be furnished later), British Air power must, include a Home Defence Air Force of sufficient strength adequately to protect us against Air attack by the strongest Air Force within striking distance of this country.(2.) That the Air Staff be instructed to draw up detailed proposals for the creation of such a Home Defence Force, to be organised, in part, on a regular and permanent military basis, and, in part, on a volunteer or &quot;reserve basis, but so arranged as to ensure that sufficient strength will be immediately available for. purposes of defence. The fullest possible use to be made of civilian labour and facilities.(3.) That the first stage of the Air Ministry&apos;s scheme, which will absorb our entire capacity for aerial expansion in the immediate future, should provide for a strength of 600 first-line machines that is to say, a number of machines equal to the Independent Striking Force of the strongest Air Force within striking distance of this country.The details of this stage should be arranged with a view to the possibility of subsequent expansion, but before any further development is put in hand the question should be re-examined in the light of the then Air strength of foreign Powers.(Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee),SALISBURY (Chairman).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, June 12, 1923.
