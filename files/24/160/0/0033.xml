DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)cabinet business OF THE HOUSE. (Tuesday, 89th May to Friday, 10th-August 19S3)Note by The Chancellor of the Exchequer, covering Memor-andum by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury.I circulate the attached Memorandum by the Parlia-mentary Secretary to the Treasury on the question of Business iri the House of Commons.(Intd)      S.B.asury Chambers, May 7th 1923,
I feel that it is n-y duty to bring to your notice, for the information of the gabinet, the position of Government Business in the House of Commons having regard to the time available from after Whitsuntide until August. ,It is, I am informed, the general desire of the Cabinet and I know it is the desire of the House that, if possible, an Autumn Session should be avoided and that the House should rise as early as possible in August, at any rate not later than the 10th. I have received several requests from Ministers with regard to Bills, of which I have not received Cabinet instructions, but it is impossi-ble for time to be found for any Bills other than those mentioned.on the attached statement, if the House is to rise by the middle of August.I attach a statement showing,(l)   Government time available after Whitsuntide until the 10th August;( )   Business of which I have been given notice andan estimate of the time which must be given for its consideration.It will be seen from this statement that the whole of the Governmenttime is taken up and I must point out that I have based this&apos; estimateon very conservative principles and I cannot guarantee that more time than I have allocated will not be demanded by the House for adequatediscussion of the very important measures which are to be brought before it.I am informed that it is essential that all the legislation I have mentioned in the statement should become law bofore the House rises in August, and therefore the situation, as it now stands, cannot be eased in any way by an Autumn Session, but I would submit that, if further legislation- is necessary, an Autumn Session in unavoidable, and that no further Bills can baintroduoed for which time could be found before the House rises in *ugu8t.Even with the present programme, it will, I fear, be necessary for some of the minor measures now before Parliament to stand over until some time after August.(Signed)   LESLIE WILSON.Monday, 7th May, 1933.
