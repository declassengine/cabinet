HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;s GOVERNMENT.CABINET,The question of an Exchequer Grant for      &quot; necessitous areas.IC.RBT. COPY. Ho. Ig!J. 266(83)Memorandum by the Minister of Health.It may be well to give for the information of my colleagues a short resume of proceedings in this matter,1,       The question of a grant was first raised in 1921, but at the end of that year it was agreed by the Secretary of the Association of Poor Lam Unions that the oase for it could not be pressed since the Guardians had in fact been able to carry on without it,     It will be remembered that the particular difficulties of the poor Unions in London had been met by the passing earlier in 1921 of an Act which   inter alia equalised outdoor relief charges over London.    After the passing of that Act the question became a purely provincial one.2,        Immediately after the Poor Law Conference held cm the 14th February, 1922, a further deputation  from provincial Unions was received by Sir Alfred Mond,    The new point made by the deputation was that the distress in their areas wasilargely due to the importation of workers during the war for Government employment,    An investigation made by the Registrar General into the case of Sheffield, which was regarded as a typical case, did not suggest that war activities had led to any substantial permanent accretion of population in the industrial areas.3.        On the 20th June, 1922, a deputation headed by three Members of Parliament was received by the then Prime Minister, accompanied by the Ministers, of Health and Labour.    The deputation represented the enormous growth in poor law expenditure in certain areas and the substantial sums which, in addition to large sumsraised/
raised by rates, had been borrowed for current expenditure under the Local Authorities (PinancialJProviaions) Act, 1921. The prime Minister in reply&apos;pointed to the impracticability -.df the increase of taxation necessary to meet the application, . and to /the direct relief to the rates derived from-unemployment insurance.   He promised consideration of the results of the &quot;gaps&quot; in insurance benefit, at that time five weeks in every ten.   By legislation passed in the sane Session.: those gaps were reduced to one week,, with consequent increased charge on the Treasury and decreased charge on the rates.     Continuing, legislation on the same lines has been passed in the present year.4.        A deputation headed by two Members of Parliament was received by the Ministers of Health and Labour on the 20th March, 1923.     The case as submitted by the deputation was substantially unaltered, but attention was drawn to the fact that the longer Exchequer assistance was delayed the heavier the burden on the necessitous areas,     Attention was drawn in my reply to the difficulties of devising any equitablei ;. i &apos;, ! V     v  \&apos;.f &apos; &apos;:&apos;     : ,    I . &apos; .. i!   : iu - &quot; V, : &apos;l   . i.    if&apos;.&apos;&apos; i &apos; :formula for the distribution of a grant b4 Poor Law Unions whose expenditure was determined much more by local policy than by any absolute conditions.   I offered, however, to have the formula submitted on behalf of the necessitous areas discussed with officers of the Ministry to see whether it was really possible to get any sort of scheme which, without creating more dif f icxxlties and more unfairness than it removed, would enable the Government to satisfy, or partly satisfy, the desires of the deputation,     I definitely stated that I did not promise to ask the Cabinet for sanction to distribute a grant, -5t There have since been discussions on the formula between officers of the Ministry of Health and representatives   :. of the necessitous areas.     As a result, the representatives have/
have put forward amended proposals as follows(1)   To the Guardians of each Poor Law area In which &quot;the average number of persons relieved during the year&quot; is in excess&apos; of &quot;the number appropriate to the area&quot; there shall (subject to the limitations herein provided) be paid a grant as follows- (2) In respect of every excess case relieved 75$ of either of the following amounts, whichever is the less;-(a) &quot;The average expenditure per person relieved&quot; Inthe Union area;   or(b) &quot;The average expenditure per person relieved&quot; InEngland and Wales,(3)   Provided that:-(&amp;) In no case shall the amount of grant exceed 50% of the &quot;net expenditure&quot; of the Poor Law Authority during the year   and(b) If the grant as calculated is. of an amount whichwould reduce the &quot;Looal Rate&apos;11 to an amount lower than the &quot;Standard Rate&quot; the grant shall be reduced so that the &quot;Local Rate&quot; is equal to the &quot;Standard Rate&quot; j   and(c) Ho grant shall be payable to the Poor Law Authorityof any area in which the &quot;Local Rate&quot; is lower than the &quot;Standard Rate&quot;.Definitions,(4)   For the purposes of this Scheme the following definitions shall be applicable(a) &quot;The average number of persons relieved during theyear&quot; shall be the average of the four quarterly returns of the Ministry of Health, Issued during the year ending the 31st March,(b) &quot;The number appropriate to the area&quot; shall be calculated as follows:-Average No. of Persons relieved.     population during the .year per 1,000 of of Unionpopulation in England and Wales. X    Area.   ^I Id&quot;oo&quot;(c) &quot;Net expenditure&quot; shall be the net expenditurecharged to &quot;Common Fund&quot; as apportioned amongst the Palshes during the year, less grants received under the Agricultural Rates Aot, 1896,
Ill i(d) &quot;The average expenditure per person relieved&quot; shallbe the net expend: ivr-p ftivinod by the average number of persons relieved during the year,(e) The &quot;Local Rate&quot; shall be baried on net expenditure for the year and R.V. of tho area as at 1st April.(f) The &quot;Standard Rate&quot; shall be the average rate in the  required for Poor Law purposes for taw year baaed on the total Rateable Y&amp;ltio of England and Wales and- the total net expenditure in the gams year, excluding any grant received under these regulations.6.        I have considered this formula and it must be admitted that It goes some way to meet the objections which were taken to the earlier proposals.    The formula, however, still seems to me far from satisfactory.To begin with it is ineosylete.   It would involve a grant of over three and a half millions for one year to sixty-one Unions specified by the representatives, Mo account is taken of London and I am told that a number of other Unions would have to be included, the result of which would be to bring up the total cost to a very large figure.I observe that the basis of the scheme is no longer exceptional unemployment but tho more general one of exceptional burdens in areas of low rateable value.   This takes the question out of the category of the temporary and transfers it to the permanent.- Since the distribution of the benefits is to some extent regulated by the local rate in the pound,, the scheme is unfair because the method of assessment is not uniform, through-out the country^   moreover, an examination;of the results of the formula as applied to various Unions reveals differences in the treatment of different localities, which would be difficult, if not impossible, to justify and which would certainly give rise to very strong protests from certain Unions,     Generally speaking,&apos; it would seem to be still the case that the largest benefits would go to the largest spenders without much regardto/
to economy and efficiency of administration-.7,        It is possible that the diff.xcu3.tlee enumerated above might be to some extent met by modification of the fcrsiula^ but. it does not seem to me possible to device any method of Exchequer Grant to necessitous areas that is not open to grave objections.   Such a grant must necessarily tend to sap self-reliance and sense&apos; of responsibility and inevitably it must be accompanied by some me a sire e of central control,In my view., on the other hand, local government can only be kept efficient and vigorous If it is made to exercise responsibility, and If necessary, suffer the consequences of its own mistakes,8,        It must be remembered that the result of an Exchequer grant to necessitous areas is to hide up the true facts of the Situation and very possibly to encourage acquiescence in a permament surplus of population living parasitically upon the community.   The sound policy should be, on the contrary, to encourage the utmost mobility of labour so that the national pool shall be available as a reserve to all parts of the country9.        I fear there is no system by which we can avoid allotting more by Exchequer grants - to inefficient or extravagant authorities than we do to economical and business-like bodies. &apos; To take as a basis the numbers relieved instead of the amount of relief does not really get ever this difficulty, for experience shows that it is just where administration is most lax that the numbers of those who flock in to share the relief is greatest,10,      There are really two problems to be considered, which are distinct, although they have been mixed up by. the representa-tives of the necessitous areas who have been dealing with the question.There/
There 1b first the exceptional position created by the unprecedented amount of unemployment due to the war, and there Is secondly the more general question of the adjustment of the burden of rates, of which we have an example in London,With regard to the first of these, I think there la much to be said for the view that the conditions are not due to local circumstances and that the burden should be equalised over the country,    To a considerable extent this has been done by unemployment insurance, relief works and assistance by way of loan to Guardians.    Something more might be done by way of a block grant, but I conclude that this would be dangerous because it would open a door to demands for the adoption of a similar method&apos;of relief for dealing with the second and more general problem.     I think we must face a probability that in some cases the loan made to the Guardians will never be repaid, but on the whole and especially since the acuteness of the problem Is diminishing, it seems to me best to work through on the present illogical and in some respects unsatisfactory system,The second problem does not seem to me to call for a transference of part of the burden from, the shoulders of the ratepayer to those of the taxpayer,   It is rather a question of a redistribution of rating burdens analogous to the &apos; Metropolitan Common Poor Fund.^supplemented by the proposals of the Royal Commission on London Government,Whether it would be possible to work out some similar system for the whole country I am not sure;   I think  . perhaps it might, but an essential preliminary would be a reform of the valuation systom so that some kind of uniformitymight/
might be attained.I conclude, therefore, that any further consideration of this problem must, be postponed till after the proposed Valuation and Rating. Bill has passed into law.,11.      The question, however, raises political issxies of some importancej and I desire to have the views of my colleagues on it.     It will be/appreciated that the Bill for Relief of Agricultural Rates, is being used as an opportunity of pressing the claims of urban areas to relief from the Treasury,, and the announcement by the President of the Board of Education . . of an extension of the relief given by the Exchequer to &quot;necessitous areas&quot; will also be ^aJidaaasfijL as evidence that the principle has not only been conceded, tout is recognised as worthy of expansion.(12)   In spite of these considerations, however, I recommend in view of the arguments adduced above.that1. No block grant from the Exchequer should be given in respect of the exceptional burdens caused by unemploy-ment, although assistance to Boards of Guardians should be continued on the lines hitherto followed, taking the risk that in certain cases it may not be possible to obtain repayment of loans to them. . 2. That consideration of the question whether a readjust-ment of the burden of rates over the country is possible or desirable should be postponed until the Valuation and Rating Reform Bill has been passed and :.uniformity in the method of assessment secured.(Intd)        N.C.Ministry, of Health.8th June, 1923.
