L \j jDOCUilENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENT). &apos;251(33). 0 A B I IT E T.COiinlTTEE Off HOUE AFFAIRS.HONOURS (PREVENTION OF ABUSES) BILL. Note by the Parliamentary Counsel on Draft Bill..This Bill is intended to carry out the recommendations in paragraphs 31, 32, and 34 (5) of the Report of the Royal Commission on Honours, vis, that a short Act should be passed which would impose penalties on any person offering to become instrumental In the securing of an honour for another in respect of a money payment or valuable consideration, or on any person promising payment or consideration in order to receive an honour.The honours to which the Bill is intended to relate are personal distinctions which are conferred by His Majesty as &quot;the fountain of honour&quot;, and the proper description of these distinctions seems to be &quot;dignities and titles of honour&quot;, &quot;dignity&quot; meaning the honour conferred, and &quot;title of honour&quot; the description of the person who bears it.Dignities and titles of honour include the various degrees of nobility, baronetcies and knighthoods.The draft follows to some extent the Prevention of Corruption Act., 1906, which appears to be the nearest precedent for a Bill of this kind.     That Act dealt with wrongful trans-actions on the part of agents which might previously have been the subject of civil actions and brought them for the first time within the criminal law.The present Bill deals with transactions which however reprehensible are not criminal, and probably would not be the subject of civil proceedings.
It would appeal&apos;1 therefore that the transactions which are the subject of the present Bill could hardly be described as corrupt so as to justify the use of the expression &quot;corrupt&quot; or &quot;corruption&quot; either in the body or in the title of the Bill, seeing that the term implies the breach of a public or private duty.-It is therefore s\iggested that the long title of the Bill should run - &quot;for the prevention of abuses in connection with the Grant of Honours&quot; and that the short title should be &quot;The Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Bill.&quot;     In following the precedent of the 1906 Act, offences against the Bill are made misdemeanours and are punishable either on conviction on indictment or on summary conviction;   the maximum penalty in the former case being imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or a fine not exceeding five hundred pounds, or both: and in the latter case, imprisonment for a term not exceeding four months or a fine not exceeding fifty pounds, or both.A prosecution under the Act qf .1906 cannot be instituted without the consent of the Attorney General;   but it is submitted that such a restriction would not be appropriate to the present Bill,(Sg,)   P.N. GREEKo3rd liay, 1925.
