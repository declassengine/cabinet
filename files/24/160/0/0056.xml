On the same date the number working, short time and drawing benefit for intervals of unemployment was 53,000 as oompared with 55,301 on May 7th.Documents quoted in this report are evidence that Russian propaganda in this country, far from having ceased6ha3 been intensified oinoe the exchange of Notes.     The Communist International has issued inflammatory manifestoes and has inspired the campaign of the Communist Party of Great Britain against the British&apos;Government,A report is given of an important joint meeting of delegates of the International Transport Workers and of the Bus sian Transport Workers:   this meeting was largely the result of propaganda on the part of &quot;the Red International of Labour Unions.The Executive Committee of the Young Communist International is dissatisfied with the laolc of progress made by the Young Communist League of Great Britain.Discontent in the coal fields has been exploited as much as possible by oommunist agitators but it is doubtful if they will Bucoeed at present in bringing about the termination of the national wages agreement.
--uaiag PROPAGANDA AGAINST GREAT BRITAIN 3 9 9The Ibbus of the &quot;International Press Correspondence&quot;for May B4th deals at sons length with the Anglo-Bus elansituation:   in an unsigned article entitled &quot;The LastAttempt of Soviet Russia to preserve peace with England&quot;the concessions offered in the last Russian lote arerecapitulates and the writer proceeds:&quot;If, after the concessions which the SovietGovernment has roe.de, Lord Curzon persists in bringing about the breach he will thereby furnish the bestproof that war is his objective,  just as it was the objective of the mad Junkers of the foreign office in Ally 1914.   In its desire for peace the SovietGovernment went further then, any bourgeois governmentever went.   For, while Lord Curzon counts upon buyingforeign mercenaries with English gold, the Sovietfipverntnaiit knows only- too well,,that war costs precious Diced, the blood 01 Bullions 01 raissian laasaircc anaRussian Workers.   It therefore spares nothing in orderto avert bloodshed.    The Soviet Go\d rnmsni; knows that once the cannon begin to roar in the East the monsterof war will devour the Western Europe an proletariat..For the war would extend beyond the wsichsel.   Andthe Soviet Government is bringing all these sacrificeson behalf of the Western European Proletariat.   Thegovernment of the World Revolution does not gamblewith the mountains of corpses which a world war wouldoost.     It only counts upon the will of the millions of proletarians who axe driven by internationalcapital into the struggle for emancipation.     Thebourgeois and social democratic press sought to incitethe working masses against Communism and againstSoviet Russia by tho lie that Soviet Russia isembarking on warlike adventures, that she seeksimperialistic conquests, in order to stimulate theWorld Revolution artificially. Should lord Curzonbreak off peace relations with Russia he will, therebyfurnish indisputable proof that not the SovietGovernment but the ruling clique of the leadingcapitalist country in Europe consists of adventurerswho are anxious for a new blood bath by means ofwhich they hope to hurl beck the European labour movement for decades.    Should these adventurerssucceed in their plans, then every healthy and honestelement in the labour movement will rise like one manto support Soviet Russia in her struggle against theseinsolent peace-breakers-   For this struggle isliterally a struggle for the bare existence of thebroadest working masses.&quot;Lord Curzon and the new English Government now have their choice:   they can maintain peace, thereby promoting mor9 friendly relations between England and Russia, or they can cause a breach which would mean War.   After the concessions which she has made, Soviet Russia may calmly await the decision.   Should England prefer War she will run hor head against the . iron wall of resistance on the part of the broad masses -not only In Russia but also in England.   The English working class is not socialist and unfortunately only a small section of it is revolutionary.But/
are/But like the mass of the people in every oountry, it has not lost it sense of Justice.   The English working class wants peaae and will refuse to he cannon fodder for the madly insolent Junkers.   Even Henderson, a minister of the English king during the war, protested in Hamburg in the most decided manner against Lord CurBon&apos;3 ultimatum.   What is more, not a single English liberal paper supports his attempt to drag Europe into the abyss of War.   May Curzon start the fight;   he will not finish it.&quot;A second article deals with the murder of Vorovsky andrsiterates the oharge of complicity on the part of the BritishGovernment to which reference was mafia in last week&apos;s report:extracts from the article are given below:-&quot;The English Campaign against Soviet Russia:The Soviet Ambassador Vorovsky murdered by the Fascist accomplices of English Imperialism.&quot;The note handed by the English representative Hodgson to the Soviet Government, on May 8, proves that the English Government, headed by Lord Curzon, desires a rupture with Soviet Russia.   When a Government requests that a foreign ambassador be recalled from its oountry, it is a sign of very strained relations.   But the whole history of diplomatic relations records no single case in which a Government has demanded the recall of foreign ambassadors v&amp;o are not accredited in its own country, but in other states. This demand exceeds the utmost that the victors of Versailles have ever permitted themselves with respect to any people. And England is not the victor in war with Russia.   England was defeated in the war which it carried on against Soviet Russia from 1918 till 1920.   The White Guard armies organized and financed by England were utterly crushed by the Red Array, aid their remnants thrown into the Black Sea.&quot;England&quot;s demand that Russia should unqueetloningly acknowledge&apos; England&apos;s will as international law in a question with regard to which no international agreement exists, the question of the extent of the territorial waters of a state, is nothing else than deliberate provocation of a rupture...&quot;A breaking off of commercial relations is by no means war.   Under present circumstances England cannot carry on war with Russia.   But the breaking off of diplomatic relations signifies that English imperialism will mobilize every force against Soviet Russia which it possibly can mobilize.   From the vassals of the Entente, such as Poland, Roumania, and the border states, to the Russian White Guards - all will receive their share of English sterling,&apos;that they may agitate and even fight against Soviet Russia.   In thiB fresh attempt to throttle soviet Russia, Curzon leans not only on the military and land-owning circles of England, but on that section of English capitalists who have abandoned all hope that soviet Russia is going to renounce the social conquests of the October revolution.     The commercial houses of the City, whose middleman^ profits
- s -are destroyed by the monopoly of foreign trade;   the captains of industry who, like Urquhardt, have come to the conclusion that the Soviet. Government does not intend handing over the treasures of RussjLa to them; these elements are prepared to join in a renewed attack.&quot;The first victim of the conflict Inflamed by English imperialism against Soviet Russia has fallen, before the Soviet Government could reply to the English note. The murder of the Soviet ambassador Vorovsky in Lausanne, committed by a Swiss-^Russian Fascist, the son of the Petrograd chocolate manufacturer Gonradi, is a result of the latest English incitement against Soviet Russia.   The fable that Conradi*s aim was to take vengeance for the murder of his father is utter nonsense, otherwise this Russo-Swiss White Guard would surely have discovered his bleeding heart within a shorter period then five years, and would have taken advantages &quot;of the thousand other opportunities of taking revenge on soviet representatives. If the Swiss government was capable, under English protection, of denying, to the diplomatic delegation of a state comprising one sixth of the world, those rights which the tiny principality of Monaco enjoys, then the murderer could feel confident that no hair of his head would be harmed for this assassinations&quot;And what next?   The revolver shot in Lausanne will re-echo all ever the world.   It will tell mill:; cos of workers that which they night not have gathered from the English note.   It will tell them that world capital, under England&apos;s leadership, is renewing the attack on the first workers&apos; republic of the world.   It will say to ,.the workers, and peasants of Russia:   Be ready J   And it will .-&apos; say to the workers of the whole world:   Amk&amp;J   Soviet Russia, the heroic working class of Russia, is calling youi&quot;Included in this issue of the &quot;International PressCorrespondence&quot; are Zinovievls article on Vorovsky and the manifesto on the same subject, both of which were quoted in last week&apos;s report and an articla on &quot;The Anglo-Russian Crisis&quot;by Mahabendra Hath Roy, which is an indictment of British&quot;Imperialism&quot; and concludes as followsne . * the agents, propaganda, intrigues, etc. are all a pretext.   &apos;The British bourgeoisie want to make another frantic attempt to choke the Russian Revolution, which objectively is the mortal enemy of Imperialism. Let the British proletariat be on guard, and not fall into the snare of the ruling class.&quot;The Empire is really in danger.   The sooner it goes the better.   The preletsriat has nothing to lose but its unemployment doleo&quot;&quot;The International Council of Action to fight War andfascism&quot; was in session at Hamburg at the same time as theInternational/
International Socialist Conference and addressed the followingmanifesto &quot;To the Workers of Great Britain&quot;:-&quot;The arrogant note of Lord Curzon to the Workers and Peasants Republic of Russia has aroused the hopes of the world bourgeoisie that the time is now ripe for a new war against soviet Russia.&quot;The debate in Parliament on the note of Lord Curzon has not only not destroyed our fears hut increased them. It shows the determination of the conservative government to try and crush Russia.   They absolutely refuse to withdraw the ultimatum and only agreed to an extension :&apos; of time.    This was done because they know that parliament will not be in session during this critical period and Curzon will have a further chance of forcing the Cabinet to tai-,3 action without consulting Parliament. Sinae the publication of the Curzon note the reactionaries everywhere are preparing for a new war.   Marshal Foch, head of the French Army, has boon in Poland reviewing the Polish army.   He in now in TchochoSlovakia reviewing soldiers there.   At the present moment Lord Cavan, Chief of the British Imperial War Staff is also in Poland.   The &apos;Tiroes&apos; on May 17th described his stay in Poland as &quot;the visit of a soldier to a soldier&apos;.&quot;What does this msan?   That Lord Curzon knowing he dare not declare open war upon Russia because he iB t^raid of the British workers, now tries to operate his infamous policy of intervention and war through the Border States surrounding Russia.   His first step is to smash the trade agreement between Great Britain and Russia., This would then be the signal for the reactionaries everywhere to go forward, helped by British influence, money sud munitions.&quot;The exposure in the Manchester Guardian&apos; of May 15th of secret telegrams sent by the Italian representative in Moscow to Mussolini in Rome show that the fascist government of Italy is now operating British foreign policy.   The visit of the King to Italy, Lord Curzoxfe telegram of oongratulation to Mussolini, the infamoup leader of the fascist movement, the foul and dastardly murder of Worowsky, the Russian ambassador at Lausanne, immediately after he had left Italy all show how tirelessly Curzon is working to unleash the dogs of war.&quot;British Workers.&quot;Your responsibility in view of the terribe menace to the working class movement is indeed great.   We remember with pride how by your action in 1920 you prevented war on Russia and also the export of munitions to Poland.    We have seen with pleasure the resolution of the London Transport workers, who refuse to handle any war material during the present crisis.   The International Committee of Action elected at the Conference of workers from all. countries at Francfort in March 1923 to light against war and fascism is now in Hamburg anxious to form a united front of all workers irrespective of theoretical opinion. We are appealing to the international socialist unityoonferenoe/
conference now being held in Hamburg to stand together with the revolutionary workers of all countries in the common struggle against the threatening dangers that now confront us all.   We confidently appeal to all workers Great Britain to unite and fight against war and fascism.&quot;Rally in your thousands and. demonstrate your desire for the united front.&quot;Let your slogans be:&quot;do to with the war makers.&quot;Withdraw the ultimatum.&quot;No munitions for new massacres of workers.&quot;Down with a new war.&quot;Down with fascism,&quot;Up with the united front of all workers.&quot;Harry Pollitt is a member of the Council and reported from Hamburg to communist headquarters that:-&quot;The chief work we have been engaged on is Demonstrations, Articles and lobbying English Delegation for information.&quot;An interview was arranged between one or two prominent comrades here, Clifford Allen and fiftiestley. The I.L.P. crowd are doing fine work on the Russian question.   Wheatley is fighting in committee to get a new debate on the Russian situation.   It was I.L.P. influence that made Henderson make the Russian speech yesterday.   I think they are favourable to receiving our delegation.   Old Wheatley is afraid that we represent nobody in Britain.   Especially was he doubtful of mo, owing to my connection with unofficial movements...&quot;Last night a meeting was held to protest against Curzon&apos;8 fresh ultimatum to Russia.&quot;Called at 2 hours notice 5,000 workers turned up.     To-night a demonstration is to be held as tho workers leave the factories.   T.A. Jackson and a Scotch comrade are doing good work.   The effect of the pressure of British comrades is having a tremendous political effect...&quot;In another report Pollitt stated, that:-.&quot;The three main questions affecting the international working class are as follows:-1,     Curzon&apos;s Notes to Russia and Germany. 2.     The Occupation of the Ruhr. 3.     The Growth of Fascism.All our propaganda is to be made round these points...1/
nI hftve seen Losovsky wig he wants me to go back with him.   I on in a dilemma.   I think that I shall be given no option in the matter...&quot;The Comrades take a most serious view of the present situation, Bad ok believes it is going to lead insnedlately to Intervention and war...&quot;Subsequently Pollitt informed Headquarters that:-&quot;The International Congress has Just refused after three days waiting to reoelve a delegation from the International Council of Action eleoted at the Frankfurt Conference.&quot;i had been appointed as speaker for the delegation and had written out my speeah, which was submitted to the Comnittee and endorsed.&quot;To-morrow it will be printed in the Party Paper in Germany, and I am instructed to send copies to &quot;The Worker&quot; and &quot;Workers1 Weekly&quot; and ask you to try sad print extracts if you oan&apos;t manage to print it all. You know how they Insist on these things...&quot;The speeoh mentioned above was a condemnation of british foreign polioy and an appeal to,the oonference to form a united Front with the extremists &quot;to organise mass agitationana a one day general strike;&quot;(I) to ootjshat the new war and intervention against Huseia,(2) to secure t,he withdrawal of France frotu the Ruhr. (2) to fight against Fascism.&quot;On May 24th District and Local Party Committees were informed by tho Political Secretary that &quot;&quot;In view of the refusal of the Hamburg Conference to make the United Front with the International Committee of Aotion, the Central Committee...urges every section to...make the United Front with the masses direot and challenge the leadership of the Seoond International.&quot;m COMMUNISTSThe keynote of communist propaganda at present is that &quot;The danger of the world attack on the workers is not past. The forces of world re-action are still gathering unaer the leadership of the British Government to launch their attackon/
on the centre of international working class power - the Russian Workers&apos; Republic&quot;.t?A we 11 -informed correspondent reports that the British delegates who were to visit Russia have been advised to return to England in order to make themselves safe in oase of an open rupture,     Jackson, on arrival in Berlin, met Bell who was surprised to see him in view of the fact that London had been asked to stop the rest of the delegation from starting. Jackson discussed the situation and on the face of an important c cnimunicatlon he was carrying to Moscow desired to go on.   Radek, MaoManus and Philips Price, however, decided that he must return to England.   Maelfcnue has instructions to organise the whole of the Communist party of Great Britain for intensive propaganda against government action against Russia while the crisis lasts, and is in supreme control on a mandate of the Executive Committee Comintern.       Jackson end Pollitt are still in Germany attenting conferences and doing propaganda work:   they have been in Berlin, Hamburg and Altona together.&quot;MacManus&apos; return to this country haB resulted in anincrease of meetings in the London area and South wales has also received special attention:   most of the &quot;star&quot;speakers of the Party have been fully occupied:     Hewhold,for instance, spoke at Abertillery and Cardiff and MacManusaddressed four meetings on Kay 27th:   the publio audiences havevaried from 100 to 400.   On May 24th an urgent whip was sentto London communists in which it was stated that:-&quot;There will be an AGGREGATE MEETING OP PARTY MEMBERS ON SATURDAY, MAY 26th at 3 P.M. AT SOUTH PLACE INSTITUTE.     A MEMBER OP THE EXECUTIVE OP THE COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL will attend to direct you in the policy and methods to be pursued with regard to the Russian situation.&quot;The reply of the Russian Government to Lord Curzonis/
is known to you from the public press, but the UNPUBLISHED NOTE WILL BE MADE KNOWN TO YOU AT THIS MEETING.&quot;It is important that Party members should understand this ctisis from the point of view of the Communist International and absence from this meeting will need a satisfactory explanation...&quot;Some 400 communists were present at the meeting which is described by one of the audienoe as &quot;by far the mostimpressive representative gathering of comnnxnists held inEngland&quot;.    Mao Manns was the &quot;member of the Executive of theCommunist International&quot; and he spoke on the Russian question for an hour and a quarter.    Shorthand notes could not betaken but the following are the main points in MacMamts&apos;speeoh&quot;The Russian people are used to ultimatums as everyone sends them ultimatums-^   When they are not amused at them, as they were on receipt of Hodgson1^ note, which ended by saying, :This is final1&apos;, they take it that the other Governments are simply testing their strength by that method.   They realise that if they give way on one thing, they will be forced to on another, and 30 on until tho Capitalist &apos;Govemments destroy the Soviet State...    When war was found futile they tried diplomacy, and when this in turn failed, they turned to war again.   But the Councils of Action in this country formed by the Labour Party, checked the British Government. What then did the British Government, or rather the Capitalists, do?&quot;By breaking up the triple alliance, the Capitalists had the workers on their knees and thought that they could do what they liked with them in this country, as well as in Russia.   These Councils of action disabused them of that idea.   They then set to work assiduously to poison the minds of the workers against the soviet. The case of the olorlo spies was made much of.   Trawlers were sent to be caught.   Trumped up cases against so called spios.   Told falsehoods against spieB who were caught in Russia, tried and convicted.&quot;The time chosen for the sending of the Note was when the one man round whose judgment and loyalty to the workers, the masses of Russia have rallied, was ill -(Lenin).   They thought that there would be a split among the other personalities, but they had found their mis take.&quot;In Conference after Conference the Capitalist \ Governments have tried to make soviet Russia lose her political sovereignty, and tirm and again they have failed.They/
They thought that if M. Krassin was allowed to stay amongst them and felt Western civilization, and learned how good it was, they would he able to educate him to their way of thinking.   In this they failed.   The Soviet is fully determined not to give up one iota of her political sovereignty.&quot;In every move of the Capitalist Governments, the Russian people, in the light of past experience, uncertain of the doings of other Governments from day to day, have become very alert and suspicious.   In every move they see that the destruction of the workers&apos; Republic is the underlying motive.&quot;Such is the attitude of the mind of Russian people and so soientifioally worked are the machinations of the Capitalists that it is now thought that a rupture cannot be stopped even by Councils of Action.   It was for this they must he prepared.   The Councils of Action might stop it temporarily, but to do so permanently we shall have to have a real live permanent Council of Aotion...&quot;The British Government tried to work up public opinion against Russia, took advantage of Lenin&apos;s illness, saw the inflammable material lying ready along the borders of the Workers&apos; Republic and is now trying to fire the fuse.   The Russians know this and have realised it all along.   They know too that this is Capitalism&apos;s fight for life.   The Russians amusement at Hodgson&apos;s Mote found vent in pleasantries of Weinetein and now they say -Well we shall have to ooncede to you all these trifling things that you have accumulated with suoh ridiculously elaborate zeal, but we know that another excuse will be found to bring about a rupture.&quot;Another correspondent states that:-&quot;The discussion made it apparent that the meeting had little confidence in the Executive Committee of the Communist Burfcy of Great Britain.   Instead of discussing ways and means of assisting Russia from a Communist point of view the Executive Committee and the London Party Council were blamed for having no plan of campaign, laok of methods and ao-ordination.   Murphy defended the E.C. by saying that during the past fortnight, King Street had sent out more leaflets and suggestions than ever before.   Cant defended the London Party council similarly and urged members to attend their aggregate meetings.   The only suggestion put forward was that local councils of aotion should be formed.   Bort Joy pointed out the uselessnesB of the &quot;Councils of Intation&quot; and prank Smith (R.I.L.U. ) attacked the Commuaist Party as a whole, aoousing the members of inertia and laok of co-ordination. The only method of getting any results was through individual propaganda in Workshops and the formation of nuolei.&quot;On the whole the meeting cannot be considered a success from the communist point of view as the leaders ecarcely justified their name:   the communists appear disappointed withtheir/
their public campaign felso for R. Palme Dutt stated on Hay 24th that &quot;The movement in general has been badly gulled by the Commons debate and our agitation 1ms been nearly solitary.&quot;Councils ibf Action in connection with the Russian question are reported to have been formed at Barrow, Blantyre, Dundee, East Ham, Falkirk, Jtorslay, Liverpool, Newcastle and Nottingham,It is reported on the authority of a single informant that the Cojamunist P*rty is preparing a Council of Action for underground work:     the Council will hold secret meetings in different places and these will be attended only by members of   the    Executive Committees of the Communist Party and of the British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions. The officials of the Communist Party probably think that if the Russian Trade Delegation has to leave the country the Party may have to work more secretly than heretofore.kE RED IS TERN AT I011AL 01? LABOUR UNIONSThe energy devoted by Moscow to propeganda among transport workers, which has been mentioned in several reports, seems to have achieved some result in the recent joint conference of representatives of the International transport the Conference took place on, the 23rd and 24th of May, 1923, in Berlin.

(2)   Tho realization of the decisions of the Third Congress in the various oountries...&quot;The Young Communist International continued its work in the Ruhr district with the same energy as before, In the course of Sium our apparatus in this respect improves.   With regard to the great lack of capable forces, our comrade W.S- had to perform for a long time the work of a secretary of the Frankfort International Committee of Action.,&quot;Tho realization of the decisions of the Third Congress:   Our International Press was utilised for the explanation of tho congress decisions in all Leagues. A sip e dial circular on educational work, a pamphlet of   -Richard 0. on shop nuclei, and another one of Jacques Doriot on militarism were issued;   furthermore the minuteg of the Third Congress...  The Executive Coiaraittee has endeavoured to issue tho congress decisions in as many languages as possible, which, however, on account of many technical difficulties, could only be accomplished with great delayo   The theses have been issued in Gorman, Russian, Swedish, Finnish, English, Hungarian, and part also in Norwegian.   In trpita of that, however, it must be said that the elaboration of material for practical work by the vorious departments of the Executive Co&amp;committee was not achieved to a satisfao-tory extent.   This w&apos;iB caused by the conditions of work of the Executive Committee which will be dealt with elsewhere in this circular.   The work of the Executive Committee in the various countries, however, was carried through regularly and thereughly;   thus on this field we can report satisfactory accomplishments...&quot;Wo should by no means over-estimate the work aceoraplished, but must quite soberly consider the real situation-.   Now as before we must energetically induce the Leagues to carry through tho decisions of the Third Congress and elaborate the concrete materialt which is to assist tho Leagues in the application of the decisions. The Bureau Session in the beginning of July will concentrate the forces and exchange the experiences made...&quot;Since April the Executive Committee has at last received some new workers, Comrades Michalec, Jackson, WSgheim.&quot;Our financial situation is rather bad.    The budget that has been granted to us is not sufficient in order to comply with even the justifiable demands of the Leagues and of our own international work and we are therefore in many cases compelled to relinquish very important plans of work...&quot;Great Britain:   This League unfortunately does not work to our satisfaction,   This cannot only be considered a result of the youth and the lack of experiences of tho British League, ana of its relatively great distance from the international ideology and practice, but also \by deplorable conditions within the National Executive Committee (lack of discipline, lack of communistmorals/
morals of soae comrades, etc.) which do not allow successful work.   The Executive Committee hag energetically intervened here and during the propaganda week one of our members is in England.   V/e are of the opinion that a permanent representative of the Executive Committee in Great Britain is necessary in order to influence the league sufficiently.&quot;During the week nineteen packets, each containing about fifty copies of the June issue of the &quot;Correspondence of the young International&quot; have been sent to this country for the Young Communist league of Great Britain.    Part of the issue is aevoted to an announcement of the &quot;International Children&apos;s Week&quot; which is to be held from June 24th - 30th$   in an article entitled &quot;International Communications&quot; it is stated that the Young Communist International intends to establish actual contact by correspondence between the workshops end factories of Soviet Russia and the workshops of the &quot;Capitalist west&quot;.,&apos;corooii&apos;ioHOn May 26th, at Thames Police Court, Dora Savage was fined 40/* for harbouring the aliens Stefan ICovesi and Geza Pritz, whose convictions were recorded last week:   the summons against William Savage was dismissed.m MEMPIOYSPSpeakers at most of the unemployed meetings have dealtchiefly, on communist lines,with the Anglo-Russian question,but their audiences have not been large:   on May 27th only about 500 people, composed mainly of contingents fromBermondsey, Lsyton, Shoreditch, Southwark and Walthamstow were at the meeting in Trafalgar Square present/:   she object of the meeting was &quot;to protest againstthe Government&apos;s attitude to Russia&quot; and against the indemnifyBill.   Most of the speakers were London officials of theNational Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement and someof their remarks were fiery:   John Holmes for instance said:&quot;May the revolution soon come.   May the workers be behind the guns...and the master class in front and whentha/
the workers are intelligent enough to say !Fire&apos; if it is necessary, may we fire as straight as we possibly ean and may the bullets hit those who get in the way.&quot;ilgK KSVOIUTIOKARY ACTIVITIES III GEBaT BRITAINT.P. 0&apos;Cannor&apos;s new Irish Democratic league has been launched and, at the moment, its fate hangs in the balance: I    in Lancashire end the north it will probably receive aj    oertain amount of support, tut the London Irish take very1little interest in it.She Irish Republican movement in this oountry is practically at a standstill:   one or two meetings of the Irish self-Determination League and ^inn B&apos;oin clubs have been held but the attendance w.v4s poor and the business done nil.The extremists were pessimistic with regard to Art 0&apos;Brien and think he will be severely dealt with.
