a)HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITAHNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. SJGRETi   - COPY 30..P.209(23).CAB I N 3 T -   &quot;AGRICULTURAL RATES RELIEF.   .i&apos;::E^0RAW]XM&apos;BY .THE. SECRETARY EOR SCOTLAND.1,     In announcing on the 17th instant the.&apos;decision of the Government to make provision for the reduction of the rating basis of agricultural lands&apos; in England and Vales to 25$,  the Chancellor &quot;of: the Exchequer stated that corresponding arrange-rnents would, he made to meet the  jas&apos;e. of Scotland.-   I am being pressed from many quarters to state what are the intentions of the Government in this connection, and- it is-most desirable the,! early directions should be given- as to the lines to be followed in drafting the Scottish Bill.2,     In a former memorandum. R.T.G.7 of, 22nd January, 1923, I contrasted the policy adopted in regard to Scotland in 1895 with that adopted for England.    In England, a 50$ relief was given in respect of the WHOLE rates levied on agricultural land, in Scotland, on the other hand while a 5/8-ths (62-^) relief was given, and while this extended to the rates levied on farm buildings as well as the land, IT WAS RESTRICTED TO THE OCCUPIER&apos; SHARE OF THE RATES ONLY., (i.e. , to rather less than half of the total- rates levied). &apos;   This meant approximately, - allowing&apos;for the difference for farm buildings, - a relief of. 36$ with regard to the rating of farms in-Scotland.as against 50$ in England. &apos; - &apos; .&quot; -3. &apos;  This differential treatment of Scotland -is explained-by the fact that in shaping their policy in 18.96 the Government proceeded oh the assumption that the Scottish grant -would be fixed on&apos;Goschen principles at 11/80the of the English grant. The-sum thus available, owing to the relatively greater extent of agricultural lands and consequently larger proportion of the rates raised therefrom in Scotland, - could net give an equal measure of relief, and in the circumstances it was decided to limit the relief as already stated to the occupiers1 half of the rates - a limitation, which also had certain advantages from the- Parliamentary, standpoint.   Two years later, it was recognised that Goschen principles would net meet the case of Ireland, which was accordingly given like England a grant equal to half of the rates on agricultural land, and a supplementary grant was. simultaneously provided making the Scottish Il/8Cths up to the English level.    It had previously been found that the 1896 grant, owing to an over-estimate of English requirements and consequent over-estimate of the Scottish 11/80the,  did not in fact enable a grant equal to the full 5/8the relief on occupiers&apos; rates to be given.     The amount was about .320,000 short.   When the supplementary grant became available in 1893 this shortage was made good, but the policy of a 5/8ths relief -limited to occupiers - remained unaltered.     The result was that while there was allocated to Scotland under the two Acts of 1896 and 1898 a grant equal to one-half of the rates on agricultural land as in the case of England and Ireland,  -amounting in all to . 280,000, - only  180,000 of this amount was appropriated to the relief of the rates on farms.   Thebalance/
balance of 2100,000 v/as devoted- to other purposes which should properly have been a charge upon the. general taxation of the country&apos;, and has protected the Exchequer against corresponding demands for these purposes during the intervening period.&apos;    This diversion of a large part of the 1896-98 grant from what was quite justly regarded as its primary purpose has all along been a source of grievance to the agricultural interests in Scotland, and they claim that the matter should now be rectified so as to put the.&apos;, on an equivalent footing to these interests In England.4.     Aa already stated, the relief on the rating of Scottish farms actually given in 1893 was lied ted to a 5/8ths reduction of the rating basis for the occupiers&apos; half of the rates.     On the basis of present day rates an additional reduction of l/8th to the occupier would mean a loss of about rl50,000 in the produce of the rates, which would require to be made good by Exchequer grant.     Thus, to reduce the rating basis for farms in Scotland for all rates (owners&apos; and occupiers&apos;) to one-quarter, i.e. , 2/8tha, - would mean an additional&apos;relief of 1/8th on the occupiers&apos; rating basis, and a 6/8ths relief on the owners&apos; rating basis,  or a loss of 2150,000 x 7 3  1,050,000.5,     This, however, would obviously give more favourable rating conditions in Scotland than in England as the Scottish relief extends to fare buildings&apos; as well as land.   A calculation shows that an equivalent measure of relief for Scotland would involve reducing the rateable basis of land (including buildings) to l/3rd for all rates, which would mean a deficiency in the produce of the rates of  850,000.   If a grant of this amount is given the treatment of the agricultural ratepayer in the two countries can be equalised, and a long standing Scottish grievance removed.   There are two alternatives - either to continue to rate Scottish farms6h a substantially higher basis, or to give the full reduction to a l/3rd rating basis without making up the full amount of the loss, - which latter alternative would mean a transference of additional burdens to the non-agricultural ratepayers.    1 cannot, in existing circumstances, recommend either of these solutions, end accordingly submit that the diversion as already explained of a large part of the relief money of 1896 to purposes other than relief of the Scottish far.aer, which should, properly be met from the general Exchequer, gives Scotland now a claim to be placed substantially on the same footing as England, and that this can only be done by making the rating basis for land and buildings l/3rd, and providing the full amount of the consequential shortage &quot;by a new grant. If so decided, a Bill to give effect to this policy will be prepared and submitted for consideration without delay.NOVAR.Scottish Office,Whitehall, S.w.1.24th April, 1923.
