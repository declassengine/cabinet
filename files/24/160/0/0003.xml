A national rent strike and means of opposing   cviotions are under consideration.     Thei conference rejeotea the nominal leadership of the Communist Party but decided to affiliate with the Red Internationa of labour Unions.The names of the British communists who have been asked to go to Moscow for the special meeting of the Comintern in May are given in this report!   they include those of J.T. Walton Newbold, M.P., and 3. Saklatvala, M.P.9 0Extracts are given from a report sent to Moscow on the communist organisation of women in Great Britain.
The arrangements for the visit of the Executive of the Communist Party of Groat Britain to Moscow have now been completed:   the Enlarged Session of the Executive of the Communist International is to commence on May 20th and there will be subsequent &quot;private sittings&quot;.     According to present plans the delegates from the British Jlcecutive will be;H. Palme DuttA. 11;;;c.)in Tom BellW. GallacherB. Sviewart H. Pollitta* McMmug (alroads in Moscow).In addition to the Executive the following leadingcommunists have been proposed as delegates:J.T. Walton Hawbold, M.P.8. baklatvala, M.P. (or W. Harming ton)T.A. Jackson (former editor of &quot;TheCommunist&quot;). W. Mellor, (industrial editor of &quot;the daily Herald&quot;).Prior to the departure of the delegates a full Executive meeting is to be held in London on April 28th-29th;   the members at present in the Provinces are to come to London &quot;ell dressed up&quot; and ready for &quot;the great adventure&quot;.The Communist Party has been instructed by the Committee for International Action to make arrangements in this country for an &quot;international campaign&apos;1&apos;1 in connection ?dth the situation in the Ruhr, from April 15th - April. 30th: simultaneous meetings are to be held in the principal centres on April 22nd and the following speakers have been suggested:Birmingham Helen CrawfurdCardiff&apos; T.A. JacksonGlasgow J.T. Walton Hewbold, li,p.Manchester Robert Stewart and/orWilliam Gallacher.In London the communists have secured the use ofTrafalgar/
Trafalgar Square. Weokert has instructed Tom Bell toheve 25,000 copies of the manifesto of the recent Frankfurtconference printed for distribution in Great Britain:   theexpenses will be paid by the &quot;International Committeeagainst War and Fascism,&quot; of which Heakert is secretory.The following report on the work of the &quot;Women&apos;aScotion of the Oonsaunist P;secretary has been drawn up by HelenCrawfurd and forwarded go Moscow:&quot;An attempt was made to carry out instruction of International Pruuensecreturiat re women1s Duy -Glasgow, Liverpool, Edinburgh, Manchester, South Wales, Bradford^ Birmingham  D.P.C. and. several area groups responding.   The general report being, conditions here are ripe for work among women, but we have not the human material to initiate or carry it through.     Prom co-operative sooietiss have coma invitations for women speakers which we have been unable to accept.&quot;The condition in Lundee Jine Workers strike, Agricultural women workers* Glasgow rent evictions^ oalls for assistance from the Paris fa the shape of competent trained women propagandists, or financial facilities for those already in Party to be sent into those areas;&quot;As a praotical step I am already in consultation with Mrs. Horrabln about the formation of a class for the training in the London area of women speakers who could at any rate carry Into labour Party, women1 a sections, Co-operative movement the Communist Party message and who could also in Industrial disputes give assistance.    There are already in Party women like Comrudo Minnie Birch who ought to be freed from technical work.    The interest in the Children&apos;s Eoaies TwV       ,) shown by the Co-operative Women.1 s Guilds being an excellent introduction to the Guild for Cosomunist party women and speakers.&quot;Cosjrwtes like Minnie Birch, Mru. Walicer (London) Lily Webb (south Shields), Sadie span (Glasgow), Mary Soutar (Dundee), Elizabeth Snowden (Bradford), Mrs. E. Brown (Bradford) under direction of National Committee funds permitted, could be sent out or instruoted to initiate work in their respective areas on lines approved of by National Committee,    The sending out of directions is so muoh waste of paper, ink and energy unless we are prepared to follow it up by assistance to initiate where neoessary. &quot;      -------------------
&quot;I very seriously question the value of eviotion resistance so far as the Coraraunist part? is concerned if : O.P. irarabers inside the National Union Unemployed Workers&apos; Corataittee Movement carry it through.   It airqply leads   &apos;   &apos;. them into a blind alley ana the party gains no prestige, although teny of its members may sacrifice much.&quot;For this larger attempt in sending out women comrades finance would need to be spent.   It is ridiculous to attempt it on the amount allocated by Bwwget.   Even to cover railway fares it is insufficient - it would simply pay car fares.   If this is not forthcoming then B.C would be well advised to simply make this a department of party work and through its political bureau issue its instructions to D.P.C. which would carry out same as far as human..material available would permit.&quot;The British Joint labour Aid Committee of the Workers&apos;International Workers Relief which is running the Soviet&quot;Workers&apos; loan&quot; and of which &amp;$ax Whiteheaa is secretaryolaims that agents for the sale of the loan hove&apos; beenappointed by communist groups In the following areas:-ElantyreBlackburnBradfordCardiffCb&amp;pstov?CoventryDev/sburyDundeeHastingsHudder afieldLcecteLiverpoolOldhamPenygamPlymouthRochdaleSa If o rfiShetland.

its quota of the desired circulation of 100,000 by June gOth:   the prise will consist of a special banner presented by the Moscow soviet.The issue of &quot;The workers&apos; Weekly&quot; for April 28th is to be a special May Day ntmiber and groups have been urged to dispose of as many copies as possitle:   it is olsiraea that one  Miners&apos; Lodge in South Wales is to take 1,000 for free distributions)The publishers of the&quot;International Press Correspondence&quot;are complaining bitterly that only about twelve subscriptionshave been taken out for the paper in England:     they have informed the British Coacmnist Party that:-&quot;Considering the high cost of printing and so on, we find It quite impossible to go on spending millions of marks for our English comrades without getting the least return.   In our opinion, theEngllsh Party should do the same as the parties of Prance, Italy, Switzerland, Yugo-slavia, etc., namely take over a certain number of In-Pre-Cor (say about 100-120) and distribute it among the main functionaries...&quot;J. C. Liu, on behalf of the Executive Committee of the Communist International and the Communist Party of China, has requested that literature issued by the Communist Party of Great Britain and the young Communist League may ba sent regularly to Yuan Yuen Chao, National University, Peking, in order that the conmunist movement in China may benefit from the experiences of the Western Parties.The Rev.

Larkin was in possession of several five pound notes.It is reported on the authority of a single Informant that about 30 extremists In the West of Scotland including John McLean, T. linden, Joe Molonald, Bell, and Carlton of Paisley are contemplating the formation of a &quot;Scottish Communist Republican Party&quot;:   a conference is to be held on April   21st and the Party, if formed, will suffer no dictation from Moscow but will be run on former Sinn Fein 1 ine s.m BED INTBRHATIONAL OF LABOUR UNIONSWatkins&apos; complaints regarding the shortage of money for Red International of labour Union work in this oountry have been sent to the Moscow executive by the Central European Bureau which hopes that &quot;it will be possible for you to speak in a few days with a comrade who is well known the whole matter and be able to regulate all questions with you.&quot;The British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions has been asked to send delegates to a conference convened by the&quot;committee for International Propaganda of the revolutionary workers of the Chemical Industry&quot; which will be held,probably in Berlin, at an early date.   Great Britain does not appear to have been represented at the last conference.The/

Thefollowing resolutions were passed:-&quot;This conference of delegates from Trade Organisations declares that the time has now arrived for the organised movement of this Country to take the offensive against the continued attacks of the employing class, by setting up the united front of British Workers.     And knowing that our efforts to stop the onslaught are futile by. sectional,action we hereby declare in favour of all the Workers in Britain preparing immediately to resolve to a general strike to stop the retreat and to reverse the Industrial situation favourably to the workers and declare our determination to participate therein.&quot;&quot;:Ihi s/

Workshop Committees, Trade Union Branches, Working Class Political Parties, Co-operative Societies, Unemployed Organisations, Women&apos;e Guilds and all bonafide Working Class Organisations inthe Trade Councils, which should be re-organised into Industrial Political and Co-operative departments to effect the greatest possible co-ordination of Unity and Act ion.(c) The affiliation of Trades Councils to the Trade Union Congress.(d) The formation of 100$ organised Industrial Unions.(e) The affiliation of the Trade Union Branches, Trades Councils, National Trade Unions and the General Council of the Trade Union Congress to the R.I.L.U.&quot;A Cardiff and District &quot;United Front&quot; conference is tobe held at the Labour Hall, Charles street, Cardiff, on May12th, the arrangements are in the hands of S.

nA few 4aj73 ago we received a report; from Comrade. R. who is at present in Berlin.&quot;In connection with this report we only wish to touch on two points regarfling which expect information from you as soon as possible.I    COLONIAL \jUESTI0H&quot;From Comrade R. report we gather that you are not represented in the Colonial Commission of the Party, that you have been refused a representative.   We remember, however, reading in an earlier report (Minutes) that your request for a representative lud been acoeeded to.   What then is really the case?   We are looking forward to an early answer.   It is our opinion that you should be allowed a representative for it is essential that in this respect Party and league co-operate very olosely.&quot;We have received no information regarding the establishment of a similar commission with your E.C. This should, however, be done without delay, as the matter is really very important.   We refer you to our previous instructions regarding this matter.II    FINANCES&quot;Wo must request ;/qu that this matter be thoroughly investigated.   You should appeal to the Party to appoint a commission to inquire into this matter.   We must insist upon a detailed account being rendered soon.   To this day wo know not what the claims of the Party amount to and what is the basis for their demand for repayment.   As long as neither the Party nor you have given us exact information we cannot give our opinion regarding this matter.   It is really high time for this question to be settled once for all.   Our representative who stayed in Lngland for cuite a time, was never able to get any satisfaction on this point.   We fail to understand why the Party has never ansvsered our letters regarding this matter.&quot;We are simultaneously sending a letter to tho Party with regard to this matter and request you to instruct your representative in the N.B.C. of the Party to insist upon this matter being settled.&quot;All other questions we shall disouas with Comrade R, who will give you a verbal report.&quot;There remains, however, one question which we think it necessary to raise here.   In the March Issue of &quot;The Young Communist&quot; you mention that you have addressed a letter of thanks to some members of the I.1.P, because they objected in Parliament to the contemplated mass export of young unemployed.   80 far so good, although we regret that our representative did. not raise his voice against the proposal.   Regarding the &quot;training centres&quot; we muaii request you to furnish us with mere detailed information regarding the manner in whioh they are intended to function.   It appears to us that the scheme of the Ii.P. (which coincides with that proposed by Bonar law) does not agree with our demand for manual training schools in the shops and factories themselves,but/

If ? 1*W?SHPLOYSXiAbout 120 delegates attended the third national oonforenoe of the&apos; national Unemployed workers&apos; Committee Movement which was held at Coventry on April 9th, loth and 11th.      A preliminary public meeting in the Coliseum Assembly Room on April 8th, which was to have been a &quot;great rally&quot; was very poorly attended, the audienoe of about 150 decreasing to 4Q before the proceedings were finished;   at this meeting Jfriv/iington said that the object of the conference was to perfect the organisation an&apos;  to endeavour to hasten the final clash that must come between the working classes and the capitalist class;   tho movement was therefore definitely revolutionary.The reports given to the conference by national and district offioials indicated that, apart from Scotland, the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement has lost rather than gained ground sinoe November, 1921.but rather proposes vocation sohools after the fashion of the aontinuation schools.   In any dase you must send us the draft of this scheme and supply us with further information.&quot;Regarding the struggle against the pauperisation of the youth, you&quot;.ehould work out concrete proposals with which to ^pnroach the^Y.Ii.1. with a now proposition for a united front (committee of action).&quot;You should furthermore start actions for concrete demands which the parties, trade unions ana unemployed organisations should he asked to support.   You should furthermore address a new Open Letter to the General Trade Union Council.   In this connection we refer you to our previous letters.   Act accordingly by ooncentrating upon certain demands (against emigration;   equal unemployment doles;   establishment of work shop schools;   compulsory reinstatement of unemployed young workers;   all training in those work shop sohools to be regarded as work to be paid for, under the, control of the trade unions).&quot;Report to us soon what you have done and what you intend doing. -\&quot;With communist greetings,8.0* of the Y.CI.&quot;*^Y.L.L. j.

The secretary, Hays, said that the organisation consisted of 271 affiliated and 71 non-affiliated committees:   250 committees were &quot;functioning&quot;.   The rental of the premises at 3, Queen&apos;s Square was  150 a year:   a loan of  20 had been raised to pay the first quarter&apos;8 rent and this had not been repaid.The national organiser, Hannington, reported that:&quot;He had toured Divisions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and had been successful in organising the machinery.   Factory raiding had bo en pushed forward&quot;to a great extent, and had been fairly successful.   Unfortunately this tactic was not used to the same extent at the present time, in December 1921, 17 factories were raidea in London, 2 outstanding ones were Ediswan and A.B.C. London had given the lead, but unfortunately other parts of the country had not. responded as they should have done.   Divisional Organisers had failed to report at regular intervals as had been requested.   From September 22nd last up to February 23rd his whole time was occupied with the fictional March, which had been very successful, which he hoped would be continued. There has been no great increase in the scales of relief since the last conference, at the present there is a tendency to relapse.     Guardians and Council elections: many branches had been successful in returning Unemployed dandidates, v&amp;ere such candidates wore put up, whole hearted support was given to Labour Candidates.   Out of large numbsrs of class-war prisoners who have been sent down bv far the majority were members of the organisation.

(This Document-is the.Property of 51s Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government). / &apos;CABINET. &apos;- S-.&quot;:&apos;: :      J-tJ&quot;BQRET WAR- PENSIONS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL.l&apos;.?&apos;205 ^25h (Mr. P. Roberts).MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OP PENSIONS,- I think it my duty to draw the attention of the Cabinet to this Bill (copy attached) because;-1.   the: principle, it embodies Is open to the gravest objections and must be resisted;2.   the-British Legion are supporting this.principle and are canvassing members of all parties in the House in favour of a Second Readingj   .3.   steps must be taken to enlighten Members of Parliament and the general public on the real meaning and object of the Bill, and4,   It supplies a striking illustration of the kind of re-action against the present-system of awarding and administering War Pensions which may. be. expected if in effecting reductions in the present scales of benefit -.. under, the Royal Warrants the Government fail to secure the sympathy of Parliament and the public; (see my previous Memorandum CP.147 ( 23) on the subject of a proposed reduction of treatment allowances).I wish to offer the following observations:- :- The Principle of the Bill.1. -  The Bill would effect a fundamental change In the principle of compensation for works disability laid down in the existing Pensions Warrants with the co-operation-of -all parties in the state viz. that pension is due only for disabilities connected with war service.      The question whether a disability is so connected ;(i.e. is attributable to or aggravated by war service) is at present an Issue of fact for the decision of the Ministry - subject to an appeal to an independent Tribunal.      For this the Bill substitutes a provision that any disability or incapacity from which any ex-service man, who has served, for however short a time, at home or abroad, may suffer however long after his discharge (no time limits are. recognised) shall be presumed to be due to or aggravated by his service unless or until the contrary Is proved.The
The phrase in line 12 which purports to limit wiia presumption to disease or Incapacity which &quot;could reasonably be attributed to war service&quot;attempts to disguise the radical oharaoter of the change but as a safeguard it is illusory for there is practically no disease or incapacity (except possibly such oaaual ailments as measles and Influenza) which Is not already represented in the, Pensions list.      In any case the Bill does net state who is to determine, or the criterion for determining whether the disease or Incapacity is one which could be &quot;reasonably&quot; attributed to war service.2,    The.proposed statutory presumption (which need not be supported by evidence) cannot be rebutted and pension must be granted unless the contrary can be proved.      But how would it be possible except in the rarest instances for the Ministry to prove such a negative?      Even where there was positive evidence that the first-symptoms did net appear till some time after the man&apos;s discharge the Ministry, which could as a rule know nothing of the manTs medical history since his discharge, would be quite unable to reject the claim in the many thousands of cases of disease and incapacity from whioh the civil population at large commonly suffers but which are not in medical experience traceable to a demonstrable and definite cause.      The difficulty of proof and the unfairness of the result to the State would grow rapidly from year to year.Administration.3,    The administrative anomalies would be scarcely less serious than the perversity of the. general principle. Tuberculosis, and neurasthenia - diseases known to arise at least as frequently in the conditions of civil life and work as in the average- conditions of military service during the late war - would whenever they occurred&apos; In an ex-service man be held to be attributable to war service and would have tc be pensioned accordingly.      Whenever an ex-servioe man suffered from an incapacity (even twenty pr thirty years after his discharge) he would have to be pensioned forthwith before the claim was decided by the Ministry, or the -Tribunal and pension would continue &quot;unless or until&quot; the incapacity was shewn not to be attributable.      All incapacity, according to the apparent meaning of the last sentence of clause 1, would have to be held to be attributable to service and not aggravated thereby In spite of the well known fact that in thousands of cases, particularly during the later stages of the war,&apos; men were taken into the forces though it was known and noted that they were suffering-from certain incapacities and diseases and. were for that reason placed.in the lower of the recruiting categories established by the Ministry of National Service. 1 Pension would continue in euch cases even though any aggravation by service had passed away;4.     The Ministry of Pensions has already secured by administrative practice all that is sound in the general object of the Bill, by giving the benefit of reasonable doubt to the disabled man where such doubt exists.      This is clear from&apos;the fact that from the beginning of the war till the present date approximately 1,500,000 men*s claims have been admitted and compensated as against only 300,000 which have been rejected.In
In other words five out of every six claims have been allowedt     It is natural and indeed inevitable that     , &quot;Che proportion of claims admitted should have been higher during the period of actual hostilities and for a year afterwards (when only 10 per cent or less of claims wore being rejected) than it- is now when 100 claims a day are , being considered which are being made for the first time 4% years after- the Armistice. ;The practice has in fact been:-(a) in all oases to give the claimant the benefit of any reasonable doubt unless the balance of probability is clearly against him;(b) in cases of men invalided out of the service for some disability to admit a prlma facie presumption that that disability was if not attributable to service at least aggravated thereby;(o) in cases arising long after discharge to treat the fact that a man was accepted A.I.. for general service as important evidence in his favour, and(d) in the oase of all diseases to accept as a prima facie support of a claim for compensation evidence of continued ill-health which can bo connected with the disease since discharge, a connection moreover, which, in the case of certain diseases (e,g.. some forms of kidney and heart disease, tuberculosis, &amp;c.) is even presumed where the first symptoms of the disease have appeared within one or two years after discharge.What the Bill would cost.5.    Most of the 300,000 rejected claims would probably have to be admitted under the provisions of the Bill.     Cases in which aggravation has been proved to have passed away would also have to be restored to the pension list.-   The Bill would also re-act on past claims by Widows and Dependants of men who have died of ailments not hitherto accepted as connected with war service.      It is hardly possible to estimate the number of future pensionable claims that might arise among the 5,000,000 men who have served or are now serving in His Majes^y&apos;s Forces; it would certainly be at least 50 per cent more than at present.      On a very moderate estimate there would be an almost immediate addition of  23,500,000 to the present annual cost of pensions.      But that cost would be a steadily Increasing and not as at present a decreasing charge, because year by year, as the war period becomes more remote, it would become progressively more difficult to determine the civil conditions and circumstances which might have caused the disability.      And while the credibility of the claims would become less the difficulty of resisting them would become rapidly greater and soon insuperable.Conclusion.
Conclusion.6*    If the Cabinet concur .&apos;in the: foregoing observations I recommend:-  .(a) that the Bill should be opposed in principle as imposing an unfair obligation ori the State, and :that therefore it should on m account be allowed to be read a second time(b) that in view of the agitation by the Labour Party supported, by the British Legion in favour of a Second Reading all possible steps should be taken, to make clear to Members of Parliament and the Public the objections to the Bill..
