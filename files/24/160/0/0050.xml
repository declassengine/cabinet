[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s government, and should bereturned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] 293CIRCULATED TO THU CABINET, Monsieur Krassin to tho Marquees Curzon of Kedleston.My Lord,I am instructed hy my Government to hand you the following communication:&quot;The Russian Government notes With satisfaction the fact that the British people has clearly revealed Its will for the maintenance of peace and the preven-tion of a break with Russia.    Thus the very fact of the extension of the time limit of the ultimatum gives ground for hope that there Is a possibility of reaching an agreement and of avoiding the conse-quences of a break which would follow from the English memorandum,The consequences to the general peace which might arise from a break between England and Russia are causing the Russian Government serious apprehen-sions.    In such an event great danger would threaten the preservation of peace, and humanity would, as a result, be threatened with countless calamities. Serious damage would be done also to the equilibrium of political relations which are already being disturbed by a number of events, and a basis would be created for the aggressive aims of the militarist elements in most countries, even independently of the will of the British Government.Not wishing to give anybody grounds for placing, even in the smallest degree, any responsibility forLK/587823rd May 1923.the
the possibility of such results - even indirectly -upon the Soviet Government, the latter is willing to make new concessions. In view of this:1.    The Russian Government is ready, in the question of fishing in Northern waters, to conclude at once a convention with the British Government granting to English citizens the right of fishing outside the three-mile limit pending the settling of this question in the shortest possible time at an international conference:   and to pay compensation for the cases In point.2.    The Russian Government is ready to.pay compensation for the execution of M. Davison and for the arrest of the. journalist, Mrs, Stan Harding:   with the reservation, however, that this willingness in no way signifies that the Russian Government recognises that there was any irregularity in the repressive measures it took against these spies, because their crimes have been proved definitely and by due legal process, and the repressive measures against them were taken before the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Trade Agreement:   in view&apos; of which their claims can in no way be regarded as a condition for maintaining the agreement.3.&apos;    The Russian Government is ready to take back the two letters signed by Mr. Weinstein.-4.    As to the claims of the British Government on the question of the observation of the conditions of the Anglo-Russian Trade Agreement in the East, theRussian..
Russian&apos;Government, again repelling the charge of having infringed the agreement, does not see,, as far as this question is concerned, any other possibility of settling the conflict and preventing future recriminations, and of co-ordinating the differing points of view and aims of England and Russia, except by a detailed discussion of them by specially delegated representatives of both governments.The Russian Government is&apos; quite ready to reiter-ate the undertakings given in the Anglo-Russian Trade Agreement of the 16th March 1921, or to confirm-them again in a special declaration, provided that a similar declaration is also made by Great Britain.It is self-evident that if and when the British Government makes to the Russian Government friendly representations as to what it regards as infringements of the Trade Agreement, by any agents or officials of the Russian Government, the cases will be carefully investigated and the necessary measures will be taken. This is, of course, on the basis of reciprocity.Should the British Government be ready to consider the points at issue between the two govern-ments, the Russian Government is agreeable to delegate at once the People&apos;s Commissary for Foreign Affairs, Monsieur Chlcherin, to meet the representatives of the British Government&quot;.I take this opportunity of renewing to Your Lordship the assurances of my highest consideration.L.B. KRASSIN.
