DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S.....GOVERNMENT.-    517CABINET. 1JJUVENILE UNEMPLOYMENT CENTRES. Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1.    As my colleagues are aware, a Government grant of 75$ of the cost of Juvenile Unemployment Centres opened by Local Education Authorities for unemployed boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 18 was sanctioned as a temporary measure at the end of last year.   The grant was made originally for a period not excoeding three months from 1st February last; subsequently the date of termination was extended from&apos;31st May to 30th June (and in the case of centres which had been open only for a short time, to 21st July).2.     Owing to the difficulty which a number of Local Education Authorities experienced in finding even 25$ of the cost, the number of centres was a good deal less than was anticipated but there are at the present time 57 centres open with about 5,971 boys and girls in attendance.   The highest attendance reached was P,610 In the week ending 2nd May.   The cost to the Exchequer of the centres on the basis of the 75$ grant is not likely to exceed  25,000?   this is very considerably below the original estimate.3.     The prospect of the closing of the centres at the end of June or middle of July has evoked a good many protests from responsible quarters,   I was pressed on the point during the Debate on the Adjournment for Whitsuntide and there have been several Parliamentary questionsj and resolutions and letters urging continuance of the centres have been sent to me by Local Education Authorities, University bodies, Juvenile
Employment Committees   and individuals specially interested in the welfare of boys and girls.   The Press has been almost unanimous in favour of the centres and of their continuance. 4.     I have considered the question of continuing the centres very carefully and I have visited a considerable number of them personally both in London and the provlnoes. I also instructed MryJyMcKie Bryce, a member of the employers1 panel of the Industrial Court, and formerly Secretary of the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation, to visit a number of centres and report to me; his report, of which a copy is attached, is in favour of continuance.5.     I think the proper thing to do is to continue the centres over the coming winter, broadly on the same lines as at present, but with a break of about 6 or 8 weeks this summer; that is to say, to oontinue them from Monday 3rd September next to Saturday, 25th April, 1924.   The contres in my view have proved of substantial value, and are helping materially to prevent deterioration among the boys and girls who attend. It is also clear that boys and jjLrls^ who have attended the centres are being more readily absorbed into employment (see Bryce Report parat 8K6,    The rate of Government grant should, I think, remain as at present at 75$) any lower rate would fail to keep more than a few centres open.   I estimate that If the centres are opened for 8 months next winter as I propose, the numbers who attend will be somewhat larger than this spring;   but they will probably not oxceed 12,000 to 13,000.   Assuming such an average attendance of say 12,000 to 13,000 boys and girls, the total amount of the Government grant for this period of 8 months would not exceed  70,000, and would probably be materially less.Ministry of Labour. (Intd.)   M.B.13th June,1923,
I concur in the conclusions of the Minister of Labour and deciro to support his proposal.   If the Centres are closod we may expect a revival of the pressure to allow the age of obligatory school attendance to be raised to 15, which it may be difficult to resist.(Intd).E.TJ.Board of Education, 14th June, 1933.
BEEORT Of BflQUXRY. MAY. 1925,&apos;Bt. Hen, &amp;ir OJL, Montague Barlwr, K.B.B., H.D., K.P., Minister of labour, Montagu House,Sir,(1)   I have the honour te make the following report upon the Enquiry which, at your request, I have made into the subjeot *f Juvenile Unemployment Centrest-ihjeot of Enquiry,(8)   The object of the Enquiry was to determine after a critioal examination of the working of the Soheme whether it is leading te results commensurate with the oxpeaditure that is being incurred on it, and, if so, whether in all  the circumstances it should be continued.Centres visited.. - method of Enquiry,(3) The time available fer the Inquiry was very llajited and it has been found possible to visit only the following&apos; distriota, via:- Bristol, Liverpool, manchester, Leeds, Uewoastle-on-Tyne, Gateshead, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Birmingham.   In each of these distriota the Centres were visited and particulars obtained as tt the numbers in attendance, the curricula, the &quot;effect of the training on .the juveniles oonoeraed, a summary as to the industrial re-cord of each of the juveniles and S.uoh other information aa appeared essential to the object of the Enquiry.(4)   In addition to the actual visits to the Centres the position was diseuased in conference with the Divisional Controllers, representatives of Local Education Committees,
r 9 il) (j JLDirectors of Education, Chairmen and other members of the Local juvenile Employment Committees and H.M. Inspectors of Sohools. The opportunities afforded by these discussions enables me to visualise the position froci many points of view and to get a general impression of the collective opinions of those most closely in touch with the problem.! he returns in the possession of the Ministry as to the numbers in attendance at all Centres, supplemented by a special enquiry on several points of importance have also been utilised, as well as suoh general statistical Information bearing on the question of employment etc,, as is available,A list of the districts in whioh Centres are established distinguishing the 31 districts from which special returns for the purposes of this Enquiry have been reoeived is appended &quot;A&quot;,Extent of Juvenile Unemployment, (5)   One question to which speoial attention has been directed is the extent of unemployment amongst Juveniles - i,e. boys and girls betweon 14 and 18 years of age,   The statistical records available at the Employment Exchanges, e,g, the number on the &quot;live registers&quot; were not, it was generally stated, looked upon as being sufficiently complete to form reliable guides. In some cases it was suggested that the numbers on the register should be doubled, in others that 25 per cent should be added as a minimum and so on.    A further difficulty in this connection is that the total number of Juveniles between 14 - 18 in employment can only be estimated.    Again a lack of uniformity in the areas to which different sets of figures relate has added to tho difficulty of calculation.-2-
(6) As the result of a special enquiry it has been possible, however, to make certain calculations, based on returns reoeived from 31 distriots in which Centres are at present in existonoe.   The calculations have been made on the acauxaption that the minimum number of juveniles unemployed is 50 per oont and the maximum number 100 per oent above the &quot;live register&quot;, and that the total number of juveniles avail-able for employment equals twice the number of unemployment books exohangod loss lo per oent in the case of boys and 20 per oent in the case of girls.   These percentage deductions have been arrived at from an examination of tho Census ofIPopulation otatistioo.   The rosult3 of this calculation indicate that the number of Juveni2.es unemployed lies between 8 and 10 por oent;   those figures apply approximately to both boys andIgirls.   In many districts, however, tho percentages are oon-siderably in exoosn of these figures.   Thus on the 50 per oentibcois referred to above, in 13 of the 31 districts from which returns were received the percentage of boys unemployed was IS. por oent or over varying from that figure to 23 per osnt, Tho mean percentage being 15,   On the 100 por oent basis in the same districts the percentages vary from 13 to 29, the nean peroentago being 20.   The figures in the oase of girls are oven more striking,Appondod &quot;E&quot; is a tablo giving particulars for each of the 31 distriots.The results confirm tho oonsidored opinions of tho authorities in many of tho districts visited that tho number of juveniles unemployed is still abnormal and that tho problem to doal with whioh tho Centres were e3tabliehed, still remains.-3-
(7) That problem, as I understand it, is the deteriorating affect on juveniles of long continued unemployment, or very irregular employment, on their moral and physical well being, and the consequent possibility that at the oritioal age of 15 -16 their opportunities of obtaining a definite start in their industrial careers may be seriously prejudiced and their potential value ao efficient worlrpeople lost to the community.(8) So far as the work being done at the Centres is concerned, I feel satisfied that on the whole it is fulfilling the objoot for whioh the Centres were established.   Generally the curricula for the different Centres visited appear to have been drawn up with due regard to tho needs and requirements of the Juveniles concerned.   The discipline was good and those attending were evidently interested and attentive to the work in hand.   The teachers and others who had had an opportunity of observing the fffaot, were satisfied that attendance at the Centres had resulted in a distinct improvement in the general tone of the boys and girls oonoerned.   Proa a purely educational point of view it is doubtful whether muoh success could be claimed. In the oaae of the girls, however, the results are probably of greater permanent value,   more particularly in those cases in which practical work in the various branches of domestic economy was possible.   In those Centres in whioh handicraft classes had been established, such as woodwork, bookbinding, boot and shoe repairing, tho interest of the boys in their work was noticeable.In certain districts it was stated that tho existence of the Centres had facilitated the placing of juveniles in employment.as regards staff arrangements, representations were made to me in certain districts that a rigid adhesion to any fixed proportion of teachers to the number of juveniles in attendanceWork done at Centres.
was difficult of application owing to the constant fluctuations in the number attending,   A oertsin amount of elasticity in this respect ia essential to the satisfactory work of the Scheme,Proportion of,Unemployed Juveniles attendingCentres&apos;?(9) Apart however from the nature and results of the work done in the Centres, the question arises as to whether the Centres are really &quot;getting at&quot; those most in need of the influenoe which the Centres bring to bear on tho3e in attendance. In this connection special enquiry was made as to the industrial experience of those in attendance tit the Centres.The results of this Enquiry show, in general, that in. their 14th year juveniles obtained practically full employment. This result oonfirms the general statement made on this point in the Centres visited.   In their.15th year employment tends to become more irregular, and in their 16th and 17th years the lack of or irregularity of omployment is much more marked.Many of those in their 16th and 17th year would be qualified for unemployment &quot;benefit&quot; and therefore in compulsory attendance at the Centres.   Those whose &quot;benefit&quot; had expired, or, who were not entitled to :&apos;benefit&quot;, or, who were not insured are represented by those in voluntary attendance at the Centres,Por 31 Centres from whioh particulars have been reoeived the returns show that voluntary attenders formed 85 per cent of those in attendance in the case of boys and 30 per oent in the oase of girls - results&quot; which indicate broadly that so far as those in attendance are concerned, juveniles in their 15th, 16th and 17th years are fairly represented, proportionately.   It is to be noted, however, that though generally trues this statement ia by no means true of all Centres, in some the proportion being ^significant.
(10) For reasons already referred to it is not possible to arrive at the actual number of unemployed juveniles.   A conservative estimate would be ropresonted by the number on the &quot;live&quot; register plus 50$.   On this basis tho proportion of unemployed Juveniles attending the Centres is 22 per cent for boys and 12 per oent for girls.   These figures relate to the attendance in the third week of May at tho Centres in tho 31 districts from which Special returns have been obtained.In considering these figures it has to be remembered that the duration of the soherao was limited to three months and that in many cases the Centres have been in operation only for a few weeks,A further point to bo noted is that the number in attendance in any one week represents only a small proportion of the actual number of individuals who pass through the Centres, It will be appreeiated that, as was found to be the oase, the number in continuous attendance forms but a small proportion of the total number who have beon in attendance at tho Centres,Conclusions,(11) The foregoing paragraphs briefly summarise the mere important results of tho Enquiry as to the need for tho working of the scheme.Undue importance may be easily attached to the statistical results brought cut.   In this connection it is important to note that the general conclusions do not apply with equal force to all localities.   The serious nature of the problem is indicated by the large percentage of Juveniles unemployed in certain districts and demonstrates the need for some such action as has been taken.
r&quot; Ci fMeasured statistically the success of the Centres may appear to be comparatively small.   The percentage of those shown to be in attendance in one week is, however, as already stated, only a partial index to the actual number of individuals who have attended at the Centres.On the other hand the most valuable part of the work done at the Centres is incapable of measurement.   Its importance, in so far as it helps to maintain in a state of industrial efficiency numbers of juveniles who night otherwise rapidly deteriorate into the unemployable olass, can hardly be over-estimated.Again, as already stated, the duration of the soheme was limited to three months and in many cases the results shown are based on an experience of only a few weeks.   Not only has the actual period of work been short but the Centres have been carried on in knowledge of the fact that they were to be closed down in a comparatively short period.(12) It will be recognised that the establishment or continuance of Centres in any district can be justified only if, in the district concerned, unemployment is abnormal, and the continuance of any Centre must depend not only on this factor but clso on the extent to which the Centre is dealing with the whole of the juveniles unemployed.At the moment unemployment among juveniles is still abnormal in many districts and where this is the case the con-tinuanco of the Scheme is rooommen&amp;ed.(13) The volume of unemployment which should be regarded aa abnormal ia obviously a question of degree.   It is difficult of precise statistical measurement, but some 3uch measurement is, I think, essential.   The burden of proof may properly be looked for from the local Juvenile Employment Committees concerned who-7-

Not only has the actual period of work been short but the Centres have been carried on in knowledge of the fact that they were to be closed down in a comparatively short period.(12) It will be recognised that the establishment or continuance of Centres in any district can be justified only if, in the district concerned, unemployment is abnormal, and the ccntinuanoo of any Centre must depond not only on this factor but also on the extent to which the Centre is dealing with the whole of the juveniles unemployed.At the moment unemployment among juveniles is still abnormal in many districts and where this is the case the con-tinuance of the Scheme is rooommended.(13) The volume of unemployment which should be regarded as abnormal is obviously a question of degree.   It is difficult of precise statistical measurement, but some 3uch measurement is, I think, essential.   The burden of proof may properly be looked for from the local Juvenile Employment Committees concerned who
have&quot; various-sources of information, at their disposal.5?he extent to which any Centre oan be held to be effectively dealing with the juveniles unemployed is also a matter of degree, but it is one on which   the experience of the working of the various Centres should throw considerable light.(14) Opportunity  waB taken to ascertain the views of those concerned as to the desirability or otherwise of suspending the Centres during the summer months should it be determined to oontinue the Scheme,   In general,, local opinion was against suspension other than for a very short period owing to the difficulties which might arise in re-organising the classes, having regard to staff, accommodation eto.   In the event of the Scheme being continued this question might, therefore, I think, be left for decision locally.(15) Apart from the general question of unemployment amongst juveniles, my attention was directed in certain districts to the serious position in whioh boys who would otherwise have become apprentices are placed owing to thoir having passed their 16th birthday, at whioh age apprentices are usually taken on. As to this I have made no special enquiry, but think it desirable to direct attention to an aspect of the question whioh was some-what outside the immediate scope of the Enquiry.(16) 1 should like to express my high appreciation of the help rendered ue in connection with this inquiry by Hx.D.T.John who was associated with me throughout the Enquiry, and whose experience in regard to the problem of Juvenile Employment has greatly facilitated the investigation.&quot;trial Court, 5i 014 Palace Yard, 3.1,1,I have, tha honour to be, Sir, Your obodient Servant, -(SIGNED) j, MC KIEV.
