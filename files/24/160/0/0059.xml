1W 356(This doometit is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;b Government)As the law stands at present the number of councillors of a borough cannot be altered except by a private Bill or, in certain events, by a provisional order confirmed by Parliament., It frequently happens that in a town whioh has grown in popxilation, an increase of the number of oauncillorra is fount! desirable for the purpose of oarrying out the additional work thrown on the local authority and its Committees or of giving inoroaaed representation to districts which have developed more rapidly than others, or for other causes;   and the absence of any power to provide for an increase of the number of councillors without recourse   to Parliament is a serious defect in tho law, oausing much unnecessary trouble and expense to the looal authorities.This Bill proposes to enable the number of borough councillors to be altered by the same procedure as that by whioh the wards of a borough may be altered under the existing law, viz., by an Order in Council in the case of a municipal borough, and by an order pf the Secretary of State in the case of a metropolitan boroiigh.The Bill is a measure of   economy  and is likely to be quite   unoontroversial.     I would suggest that It be introduced in the House of Lords, and I would not ask that it be pressed in the Commons this session if it appears that there will be any difficulty in oarrying it through.lONFIDEHTIAL,0 A B I 1 E I,,P. 259(23)- H0i&apos;ffl   AFFAIRS   OOMMlTTEiE!.

Borough Councillors (Alteration of Number) Bill.MEMORANDUM.As the law stands at present the number of coun-cillors of a borough cannot be altered except by a private Bill or, in certain events, by a provisional order confirmed by Parliament. This Bill proposes to enable the number of borough councillors to be altered by the same procedure by which the wards of a borough may be altered under the existing law, viz., by an Order in Council in the case of a municipal borough, and by an order of the Secretary of State in the case of a metropolitan borough. By this means the number of councillors could be altered without the expense and delay which is involved in special legislation, and the change would also facilitate the re-arrangement of borough wards and the distribution of councillors amongst them.38-4a
