CABINET.IMPERIAL TIRELESS SYSTIMEMORANDUM BY THE FIRST LORD,OF THE ADMIRALTY AND &quot;THE POSTMASTERIQEWERAL. :The Cabinet at their Meeting on Faoruary 28th, 1923, had under consideration the Imperial Wireless System end. decided that&quot;(a) In view of the comparatively small capital outlay involved^ the eventual financial prospects, and the strong rcrsens from the strategical point of view for the establish-ment of a Government-owned long-distance Wireless Station, to adopt the recommendations of the Imperial Communications Committee, namely:-(i) Thtt the restriction against privateenterprise in Empire wireless telegraphic traffic should be removed, and that any private Compcny should be given a licence for long-distance communication generally, subject to appropriate conditions ?s to British personnel -.nd equipment, wave lengths, sites,  control of rates, terms of expropriation, etc,(ii) That the projected Government long-distance station in this country should be erected without delay.(b\ That the Indian Government should be free to make its own arrangements in regard to long-distance radio telegraphy.&quot;2,     The&apos; preliminary work for construction of the Government Wireless Station in England is being actively proceeded with. Subsequent to the Cabinet decision mentioned above the Wireless Commission, strengthened by the addition of representatives of the Fighting Services, have had underVeview the power necessary for this station.     They have recommended that the station should,  in effect, be doubled in power and radiating efficiency in order  that the Government wireless Station
5f may be equally powerful with those projected by Foreign Powers and commercial companies.They suggest that it should have 16 masts of 820 feat, in height, and an over-all input of 1000 kilowatts. Anything beyond this is, they think, unnecessary at present.     We strongly support the commission s proposal, In this connection we nay mention that a contract for 8 masts has already been placed, but there will be no difficulty in increasing the number.3.     The Prime Minister announced in Parliament on 5th March, 1923, the Government^ intention to relinquishtheir monopoly over the Imperial Wireless communications from this country, and that licences would be granted to private companies for this purpose subject to appropriateconditions.An application by the Marconi Company for this licence has been the only one received by the Postmaster General up to the present time,4,     The Postmaster General is now engaged in negotiations with the Marconi Company as to the terms on which licences are to be granted to them for long-distance communication with the Dominions and Colonies and with foreign countries.The first and most difficult problem has proved to be that cf the working arrangements contemplated by tho Cabinet decision between the Post Office and the Company, with the object of securing that the proposed Government Station and the proposed stations of the Company shall
bo worked in such, a way as will secure the maximum public benefit and will give both organisations a fair share of the available traffic5i     The majority of the hi, &quot;n-power wireless stations now be in.:.-:&apos; erected in the Dominions and in Foreign Countries,  are, however, already under the control of the Marconi Company or affiliated Companies, with the exception of the stations to be erected in, IndiaSingapore and New Zealand.     The Pacific Cable Board also have under&apos; conaid-eration the. erection of Wireless Stations in the Pacific, and it should be possible to ensure that the Government station in England obtains the traffic with their stations,It is understood that the Government of Ne1&apos;.&apos; Zealand will probably wish their station to work in conjunction with the Government station in England&apos;,   and. although the Stations in Australia and South Africa are being erected by Companies affiliated to the Marconi Company it may still bo possible through their respective Governments to obtain a share in this traffic for the Government station-3r
6-     The difficulty however remains that the distantcommunicating stations will, with     a   few     exceptions, be&apos; Marconicontrolled by the/Company themselves or by affiliated Componie3i. Hence, if these stations have the choice of a&apos; Government Station or of a Marconi Station with which to communicate in this country, they will naturally give prefer-ence to the latter;   and, even as regards outward traffic from this country, the Government Station will be heavily handicapped by the fact that acknowledgements of the receipt of messages, requests for repetition in case of error; and similar service correspondence, must be carried on through the medium of the distant station of the competing organisation.Marconi7.     To meet this situation, the/Company have suggested that the proposed Government Ptation should be worked under their control, from their operating Office in London, as an integral part of their o^n system, taking a proportionate share with their own stations in the financial proceeds, This suggestion has been considered by the Jmperial Communica-tions Committee, who agree with the Post Office that it is entirely inadmissible.   Not only rould it give the Government a position in the organisation of wireless telegraphy totally incommensurate with their relations to international telegraphy generally;   but it -ould also obviously tend to consolidate the Company&apos;s monopoly - to prevent which is one of the main objects of the erection of the Government. Station,,8,     The alternative suggestion of the Post Office, which is supported by the  &quot;mperia.1 Communications Committee, is that the proposed Government Station should normally communicate with certain Dominions and countries, the corresponding Stations in those dominions and.countries (even although controlled bythe/
the Company) normally sending their traffic to1 the Government Station here;   and the &apos;:&apos;erconi Stations here being free to communicate with the rest of the world,.   The precise Dominions and. countries to be served by the Government station would be a matter for negotiation, but the suggested territorial division would be based roughly on the power of the Government station as compared with that of the proposed Marconi group of stations.90     But th* hands of the Post Office would be greatly strengthened in the negotiations if it were in a position to say to the Company that, unless they agreed to a fair territorial division on the lines suggested, the Government would themselves take steps for the erection of a communicating station in at least one important centren     The Imperial Communications Committee at their meeting on the 20th March, 1923, concurred in this view and recommend a modification In the scheme&apos;&apos; recently approved by the Cabinet as follows:-&quot;fhat a condition of the arrangement to be made by the Postmaster General with, the &quot;iarconi Company for a proper division of the wireless traffic should be that the Government Wireless Station in England will work the traffic with the Mreless Station in India,     To enable the Postmaster General to insist on this condition the Imperial Communications Committee recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should be prepared;lf necessary, to finance- the construction of the &apos;&quot;ireless Station in India10.   The importance of the Indian Station (which may be regarded as the wireless centre not only of the Eastern world but also of the &quot;empire) will be enhanced when a high-power station is erected at Singapore - a course which, for strategic/
strategic reasons, cannot long be postponed,     T/e accordingly -urge in accordance with the Imperial Communication Committee&apos;s proposal that the Government should be prepared to finance the erection of a high-power station in India, unless the Marconi Company agree that, if they receive the contract to erect such a station,  it shall normally coramunic ;te with the Government station in England.     If this station is erected at the cost of His HajestyTe Government it should be worked by the Government of India who would gradually repay the cost of erection out of the profits,11, fhe Indian Wireless  Station need hot be of so great a size as the station in England,     It will not have to cover such    groat ranges&apos; as the English Station will have to reach (occasionally at least), and for this and other reasons the conditions of communication from the Indian Station will on the whole be easier.     We sugrest that, if a Government station is erected in India, it should be of the power originally contemplated for the English station&apos; before the modification proposed in paragraph 2 - i.e., :ah overall input of 500 Kilowatts,12, If these proposals are approved, the estimated costof the English station will be about  420,000, to which should be added about  30,000 for the site;   while the cost of the Indian station is roughly estimated at  300,000 exclusive of site.It is difficult to estimate the&apos; financial results of the proposed scheme with any degree of aoouraoy,   &apos; But the annual expenses Including interest and depreciation may be put rcughly at about  100,000 in the case of the English station, and at about  80,000 in the case of the Indian station.     It is thought that, during the first year or two of the service, the traffic between the English and Indian stations might be
estimated approximately. at between 25$ and 30^ of&apos; the---oxi4Srtjjag cable traffio, arid the revenue at approximately  45 , 000 for eaoh station,    /Traffic with other stations might be expected to produce an additional revenue of (say)  30,000 a year in the case of the English station, and  85,000 a year in the case of the Indian station,   reducing the.net loss to  25s000 and  10,000 respectively.     If j as is probable, the traffio increased at the rate of 5fj per annum after the second year,, the stations might bo expected to become self-supporting within seven or eight years,, and thereafter to earn a sub-stantial profit,13o SUMMARY OP PROPOSALS AHD THEIR ESTIMATED COST,(1) hat the power of th e projectod Government long-distance wireless station to be erected in this country should be increased to the overall power of 1,000 kilowatts, (2) That unless tho Postmaster General oan by other means reach a satisfactory arrangement with the Marooni Company whereby tho Government tireless Station in England will work the traffic with the Wireless Station in India, His Mh.jesty&apos;s Govern-ment should erect the high-power wireless station in India,,
