The establishments of the higher staffs of the three Services; (c.) The staffs of the Dockyards, Factories, Technical and other establishments controlled by the three Services;having regard- Firstly, to the comparative sizes of staffs now and before the war; Secondly, to the relation between the staffs and the effective national defence value of their work;Thirdly, to the ranks of the officers employed now and pre-war on the same or equivalent duties;Fourthly, to the ranks of officers employed now and the relative ranks of officers performing similar duties in France and America; and finally, to the pay attached to the performance pf similar duties in the three countries, bearing in mind the local purchasing power of money in each case.Reasonable latitude will be extended to the Committee to indicate how variations in policy would effect economies.* On the assumption of office by the present Government, Mr. Stanley Baldwin requested the Snb-Oommittee to continue their enquiry.
REPORT.PART I.-ADMIRALTY OFFICE AND ESTABLISHMENTS.Preliminary Remarks.As the object of our inquiry is to enable reductions to be effected in the Estimates for 1923/24, it is desirable that our Report should be in the hands of Government at the earliest possible moment. We have accordingly decided to submit separately Part I of our Report on the Admiralty Office and on a number of the Establishments and Services controlled by.the Admiralty, which formed the first subject of our investigations.It is probable that a number of our generalisations may apply equally to the War Office and Air Ministry; but we venture to hope that the disadvantages of repeating them in the Reports on those Departments may be counterbalanced by the convenience of having separate Reports on the three Services and by the advantage of submitting each Report as soon as it is completed.We regret that with the limited time at our disposal we have not been able to obtain the data essential to enable us to apply intelligently the two last qualifying tests specified in our terms of reference, the comparison of the conditions prevailing in France and the United States.2. We have been asked to have regard in the first place to the comparative size of the staffs now and before the war. We have accordingly taken as a basis for our inquiry the Naval Estimates for 1913/14 as compared with those of 1922/23. We would here remark that, owing to the many qualifications that would be involved in presenting an absolutely exact picture, we have made no attempt to attain meticulous accuracy in the figures quoted. The expenditure on the Admiralty Office establish-ment and the staffs of other Admiralty-controlled establishments in those years was as follows : i			1914.			1922.	Vote.									Naval Officers.

A saving of 50 per cent, on total staff costs would reduce the Naval Estimates by only 2-6 per cent.   Accordingly, although we are fully aware* Omitting Air and Transport. t Omitting Keyham College.j Omitting servants, police, &amp;c, who are not included in corresponding figures for 1913-14.8 Audited expenditure.

that real economy in a national service can only be secured by the closest scrutiny of even the smallest items of expenditure, we desire to make it clear that an investiga-tion that is confined to the staffs alone cannot yield substantial savings. Such savings can, in our view, only be found as the result of a general review of Naval policy.3. From the final words of our terms of reference we gather that we are justified in making suggestions dealing with the effect of policy upon the size and cost of staffs, but for obvious reasons we have not attempted to review Naval policy as a whole. Our suggestions in regard to policy are confined entirely to matters which have come prominently before us in considering the problems of staff.4. In the second place, we have been asked to have regard to the relation between the staffs and the effective national defence value of their work. We assume that this means that we are to consider and correlate in some way the expenditure on staffs now and before the war with the comparative effective strength of the Navy at the two dates. We would emphasise the extreme difficulty of assessing or comparing - relative naval strengths at dates separated by a period of nine years wherein naval conditions have fundamentally altered. We have not succeeded in devising a reasoned basis of comparison of the relative strengths of the fleets as a whole at the two dates in question. At the best, we can suggest that comparative strength must be fairly closely associated with the relative numbers of naval personnel borne on the Estimates.It is reasonable to assume that at any particular date the Admiralty placed in the hands of the personnel the best and most suitable combination of materiel available, and accordingly, if the personnel handled the materiel equally efficiently through being equally well trained at the two dates, then the comparative numbers of personnel would broadly reflect the comparative strengths on different dates. In 1914 the total personnel borne in the Navy was 146,000: by the end of this financial year the personnel borne will be 98,500, showing a reduction, of 32 per cent.5. Such a substantial reduction in the personnel of the Navy together with the reduction in the essential and primary fighting units might reasonably be held to indicate a correspondingly substantial reduction in the staffs at the Admiralty and other naval establishments. As a matter of fact, the reverse is the case. We find, concurrently with the reduction in the number of capital ships and personnel borne, actual increases in the numbers of the staffs amounting to in the Admiralty Office 128 per cent., in the Dockyards 59 per cent., and in other establishments 39 per cent.6. In dealing with numbers of the staff we wish to make it clear at the outset that it is beyond the competence of any Committee such as ours to determine whether every member of the staff is usefully and properly employed. The great bulk of the work done is of a nature that cannot be definitely measured; and the numbers requisite to perform the work can only be determined by the closest supervision by the individual immediately in charge of each section of the work of each of his subordinates.7. Reductions in establishments and staffs, if economy is to be effected without loss of efficiency, are only obtainable by certain methods. Putting aside the question of grading and individual efficiency, these may be summarised as follows :-(a.) Reduction of the amount of work to be performed.(b.) More efficient methods, better organisation, or improved processes.(c.) Longer working hours for the same pay.(d.) Reductions in pay.8. Taking these factors in inverse order, we understand that, so far as the civil side of the Admiralty is concerned, the rates and scales of salary now prescribed have been fixed as far. as possible in accordance with general Civil Service standards, and that these rates and scales are subject to modification every six months in accordance with the trend of the cost of living as measured by the monthly index figures.*The revised rates of pay of Naval ranks and ratings were fixed on a post-war basis in 1919, and are not subject, as are civil rates of pay, to adjustment at short intervals in accordance with changes in the cost of living. It was decided, when the revised rates were fixed, that 20 per cent, of the revised rates of officers should* During the last two years the pay of Civil Servants as a whole has been reduced under the operation of this scheme to the extent of  20 millions a year.
be considered as due to the high cost of living, and should be subject after five years (i:e., in 1924) to change either upwards or downwards, according as the cost of living had risen or fallen in the intervening period, and that there should be revision thereafter every three years up or down on the basis of the official food prices index number. As regards naval ratings, no provision was made for review of any kind.9. We observe that our reference does not call upon us to enquire into or make recommendations on the subject of rates of pay; nor, indeed, do we consider that it would be profitable to undertake such an enquiry except as part of a general investi-gation, on the one hand, into the standard of remuneration and working conditions prevailing in civil departments of Government, and, on.the other, into the rates of remuneration fixed for the fighting services as a whole.At the same time, we have been impressed throughout our investigation by the important bearing of pay and remuneration generally on the cost of the Services. This is clearly indicated by the figures contained in the following comparative statement: 11913/14.    1922/23.Million    Million   Navy Estimates ... ...     -  ...      48-73        64-88Less non-effective charges comprising half pay, pensions and civil superannuation ...       2-94        10-1645-79        54-72Pay of naval ranks and ratings ...         ... 8-2 15-8Pay R.N.R.......      &apos;...... 44 -54Shipbuilding Vote (personnel) ...         ... 4&apos;12 7-68&apos;Admiralty Office         ... ...         ... -46 1-4213-22        25-44Net effective naval expenditure ... ...     45-79        54-72Less pay, &amp;c, as above ... ... ...      13-22        25-4432-57        29-28The above statement discloses the fact that after meeting charges for remunera-tion, there is less money available to-day to purchase food and materiel than there was in 1914, although the estimates to-day are  16 millions more than in 1914.10. Any analysis of our total naval expenditure discloses the outstanding importance of pay and remuneration as a field for economy. Tor example, 1 per cent, of Vote 1 (Naval Pay and Allowances) represents the sum of  158,000.Our attention has been specifically drawn to the question of grading, and we refer to this subject elsewhere in our report. Taking the Admiralty Office as a whole, however, we find that there are at the present time 170 naval officers and 78 civilian officers in receipt of remuneration exceeding  1,000 a year. In those branches of the Admiralty where the administrative and directing staff is civilian, we find that the ratio of staff over  1,000 a year to staff under  1,000 a year (excluding messengers and charwomen) is 1 to 33; whereas in the branches of the Admiralty where the administrative and directing staff consists of naval officers, the ratio is 1 to 2. It must, however, be remembered in connection with this comparison that the Department of the Secretary, in which a staff of 372 is employed, is a general service Department for the Admiralty as a whole. Out of 234 naval officers employed at the Admiralty, all but 46 are in receipt of more than  1,000 a year. Before the war there were 69 civilians on the Admiralty establish-ment with salaries in excess of  750 a year (as compared with 78 civilians to-day on salaries, inclusive of bonus, in excess of  1,000 a year); and 52 naval officers with remuneration in excess of  750 a year (as compared with 170 at the present time receiving remuneration in excess of  1,000 a year).11. With such figures before us, we should be failing in our duty if we omitted to draw particular attention to the subject of pay; and we feel fully justified in emphasising the recommendation of. the Geddes Committee on this subject in
Part XVIII of their Report.* We understand that since that Committee reported in February last, no substantial change has taken place in the remuneration of public servants apart from a reduction of roughly one-third of the Civil Service war bonus still remaining at that date:, a 1\ per cent, reduction in the pay of the Police, and a 5 per cent, contribution towards Teachers&apos; superannuation.12. In dealing with this problem of pay and remuneration of public servants, it must not be forgotten that in the case of industries exposed to the full play of foreign competition large sections of the population have already made sacrifices, and are undergoing a certain measure of hardship through accepting reductions of wages. Their action has enabled the cost of production of some of the exports, by which the nation exists, to be lowered, and unemployment has thereby been substantially alleviated. In other industries, sheltered from the full play of economic forces, the inevitable readjustment has not yet been made, and grave inconsistencies are disclosed if the rates of remuneration in the various trades are compared. These inconsistencies tend to maintain the &quot;cost of living &quot; index figure at its present high level, and to restrict the purchasing power of the lowly paid sections of the population. A general readjustment of the scale of remuneration embracing all sections of the community would react favourably upon the financial and industrial position of the nation.It is for these reasons that we consider the pay of the Fighting Services and also the pay. of the Civil Service should be closely reviewed in relation to the scales of remuneration of the rest of the nation by a strong and authoritative Committee, appointed by the Cabinet. Without attempting to prejudge the results of such an enquiry, we suggest that, in view of the changes in economic circumstances which have i taken place even during the last twelve months, the case for undertaking such an enquiry, however strong it might have been at the date of the Geddes Committee^ report, is now imperative.That enquiry, as the Geddes Committee pointed out, would have to take into account percentage increases over pre-war rates and the relation of the pay and conditions of service of each grade to its corresponding grade in the public services and in civil life; existing contractual obligations and the possibility of introducing new rates and conditions of service for new entrants; and the extent to which provi-sion exists and has already operated for reducing rates of remuneration in accordance with the reduced cost of living.13. In regard to hours, the evidence shows that there has been no substantial change in the official working hours at the Admiralty since 1914; but there has been a considerable reduction of overtime in many Departments. Although we are of opinion that systematic working of overtime should not be sanctioned, we see no objection to a reasonable amount of overtime on work of an emergency character; and in settling the size of staffs this factor should be taken into account. Eigid enforcement of rules for the prevention of overtime entail the provision of a staff based upon emergency conditions, and therefore in excess of normal requirements. It was submitted to us that in pre-war days many Departments worked overtime to an unreasonable extent. In the Contracts Department, for example, the subordinate staff worked up to tAvelve hours a week overtime for at least six months in each year* The recommendations of the Geddes Committee are summarised in paragraph 14 of Part XVIII of their Report, which runs as follows : 11 14. We have pointed out how the pay of the Fighting Services, Teachers and Police was fixed in 1919 under quite abnormal circumstances and on a general survey we feel that the country cannot continue to support a burden of this magnitude.&quot; We recognise the complexity of the question and the difficulties in dealing with it, some of which we have referred to. We feel, however, that the subject is so far reaching that it calls for a thorough special investigation.&quot; Such an investigation would necessarily have to cover not only the percentage increase, but also the relation of the pay and conditions of service of each grade to its corresponding grade in the public service and in civil life. It would also have to take in account the contractual obligations existing and the possibilities of introducing new rates of pay and conditions of service for new entrants, also whether provision exists and has already operated to meet the reduced cost of living.&quot; We would also draw attention to the fact that in certain cases, e.g., Government offices in London, the lower grade staff paid on an overtime basis has a normal day from 10 to 5 with an interval for lunch and half-day on Saturday. This is a shorter day than obtains in outside employment, and might well be reviewed at the same time.&quot; Such an important and far-reaching enquiry is manifestly beyond the scope which was ever intended for this Committee, touching as it might the very varying conditions of life of millions of employees and their families. Indeed it is far beyond the time at our disposal to hold such an enquiry, and we have therefore refrained from making a recommendation, arrived at after inadequate investigation, and have contented ourselves with urging that the most expeditious and authoritative means available should be adopted for a thorough review of this important question.&quot;
without extra payment. In many cases it was submitted that this was a more, or less normal state of affairs, and there was evidence to show that pre-war staffs were to a certain extent overworked. We understand that proposals are now under con-sideration for the extension of the working hours of those classes of Civil Servants Avho are employed on a basis of less than an eight-hours&apos; working day.14. We are strongly of opinion that, as regards working hours, overtime and holiday leave, the conditions in Government Departments should be reviewed in relation to the conditions prevailing in civil life. While it is essential that the Government as an employer should maintain such conditions of employment as will be above reproach, it must be obvious that to raise the standard of conditions above that obtaining in private employment of a similar class will render its maintenance difficult, since its basis is unsound and insecure. It is not by the creation of artificial standards that the Government will obtain for itself the character of a model employer. We recommend that these matters should be fully considered by whatever authority may be set up to deal with pay and remuneration.15. With the foregoing considerations in view, it is obvious that the practical recommendations of a Committee such as ours must be largely confined to suggesting economies in numbers of staffs through elimination of work and improvements in organisation and method.16. To enable us to assess in close detail the size of staffs necessary for the manifold and varied activities carried on in the various Departments of a great organisation like the Admiralty, and to determine whether or not each individual is usefully and profitably employed, it would be necessary for us to make a detailed study of each section of each Department of the Admiralty, a task which is beyond our power in the limited time at our disposal. Throughout the whole of our investigations we have kept in mind the relatively small field of expenditure we have under review compared with the total annual estimates of the Fighting Services, and the caution necessary in dealing with such a highly complex machine as the Admiralty, developed by years of experience to deal with most complicated prob-lems and responsibilities. Recommendations conceived in an arbitrary or doctrinaire spirit might easily cause heavy increase in expenditure or losses in other directions. The ultimate safeguard of the nation in regard to economy in staff must always depend upon the realisation by the Heads of the Departments, Divisions and Sections of their responsibility for economical administration. That obligation cannot be too strongly impressed upon everyone concerned in the administration of their Departments by Ministers and their chief assistants.17. As a Committee we can only indicate salient characteristics which strike us in regard to practice and policy, and if as regards the latter we appear to encroach occasionally upon the field of the expert, we do so by assuming that our position is analogous to that of a Committee of Shareholders enquiring into the affairs of their Company. In private and business life at no time has it been more essential than now that coats should be cut according to the available cloth. In private enterprise, neglect of this fundamental consideration speedily leads to bankruptcy, and no employer in regulating his business can afford to disregard the facts disclosed by his annual profit and loss account.The absence of such an account in Government business makes it the more neces-sary to subject both policy and methods to the test of constant and searching enquiry and criticism.18. We now proceed to deal with some of the causes for the increase in staffs which have been disclosed by our investigation. Some of these causes can be more usefully dealt with when, considering the individual Departments in detail, but at this stage we are able to make some generalisations which affect practically all Departments.The main causes for increased staffs are as follows : (a.) The influence of changes in administrative and executive methods andprocesses. (b.) The influence of war aftermath.(c) The influence of changes in naval warfare and naval policy.19. We are aware of a belief in some quarters that the staffs are swollen as a result of individual slacking of effort and of reduction of individual out-put, and that staff has been created without the existence of corresponding work to be done.   We may say at once that we have found no evidence
to sustain that belief, and no indication of the existence of deliberate slacking or of lack of work for the staffs. We have heard evidence of inefficiency and of low output from certain sections of the staffs as compared with pre-war days-evidence of a nature which finds its parallel in private life and is not confined to Government staffs. It is impossible to ignore the fact that the general influence of war has been temporarily to reduce individual application and energy. In 1914 the conditions in the Departments had been normal for a long period! Individuals had been trained for their work; they knew their work, and routine played a large part. To-day in some Departments sections of the staffs are new to their work. They include a number of ex-service men, some of whom suffer from physical disabilities, and others aire ill-trained for their work. As a result of the evidence, it may be said that in certain sections, particularly of the subordinate staffs, the output per man is less than in 1914.20. We do not wish, however, unduly to emphasise the importance of the fore-going considerations. Greater importance must be attached to the fact that to carry out the most ordinary clerical or other transaction to-day involves a far greater expenditure of effort than in 1914. To complete the simplest transaction to-day, a much more complicated procedure is necessary than before the war. To illustrate this point we may mention that we visited&apos; a certain Department and asked a member of the staff to carry out a specific process as he would have done in 1914, and as he carried it out to-day. The process was an analysis of the pay account of a high official of the Admiralty for the Michaelmas quarters 1914 and 1922. In 1914 it was necessary to make four simple calculations and write down twenty-seven figures. In 1922 twelve calculations were made and seventy figures were written down. Another case was taken of the salary of a subordinate officer. The analysis showed twelve figures written in 1914 and twenty-nine figures written to-day. Generally it was demonstrated that the work of preparing pay lists and income-tax assessments now involves between three and four times the pre-war amount of work. An ordinary case of the preparation of a superannuation claim was analysed; and it was found necessary for the clerk to make five calculations in place of two in 1914.21. We believe that the foregoing examples are typical of the increased complication due to new policy, new legislation, and new regulations. There is also a subsidiary factor which is of importance. In pre-war days decisions on routine matters affecting a seaman or a pensioner were, as a rule, accepted without question. To-day decisions are disputed and explanations are asked for, which result in approximately four times as much correspondence from the individuals concerned as in 1914. This is partly due to the fact that new laws have been passed and new regulations framed with the result that a superannuation allowance or pension can now only be awarded after a complicated series of calcula-tions which ate difficult for the recipient to understand.Towards the elimination of these causes of extra work we regret our inability to make definite recommendations. Some of them are the inevitable outcome of the war; others are due to the more democratic and exacting spirit of the day. Time will simplify and eliminate some, while others will in all probability remain. Briefly, staffs have increased owing to the increased complexity of the work and also on account of lower, individual output in certain sections of the staffs.22. Our investigation also shows that a considerable proportion of the increases of staff are directly due to the carrying out of work connected with the clearing-up and settlement of the aftermath of the war. We do not deal with these increases in any great detail, nor do we make any suggestions for handling this work more efficiently, for we learned that it is the subject of close and constant consideration by the Heads of Departments. At the present time 392 persons are wholly employed at the Admiralty on aftermath work. Of these 384 are in the Accountant-General&apos;s Department.23. After making all&quot; allowances for changes in administration and executive requirements, for lower individual output, and. for aftermath services, we have been forced to the conclusion that a substantial part of the increase of staffs is due to development of materiel and changes in methods of naval warfare. In truth, the Departments are dealing to-day with a different Navy from that of 1914.24. Measured in terms of capital-ship strength and of personnel borne, the British Navy of to-day is smaller and weaker than the Navy of 1914. Measured in other forms of naval activity or strength, the reverse would appear to be the case,
S)and the influence of this change of equilibrium on the size of staffs is striking. Perhaps the most notable change is the change in the composition of the Navy, and the following is a comparative statement showing the numbers, and classes of naval craft now and in 1914 :  	1914.	1922. .   -Capital ships in active commission	38	22,,      ,,     reserve         ...        ...	30	2	-----   68	-   24Cruisers in active commission ...	21	,,      reserve    ...        ...        ...,	24	3	--45	-    3Light cruisers in active commission	29	32,,       ,,     reserve       ...        ...        ...    ;    ...	27	14	-   56	---46Flotilla leaders and destroyers in active commission	103	83,,         ,,          ,,        reserve	109	103	- 212	- 186Torpedo-boats in active commission	10	,,        ,,      reserve	96		--106	_  ...Submarines in active commission	72	22,,     ,,     reserve...		37	-   72	-  59Mine-layers in active commission	...	1,,       ,,    reserve	7	__-   1Mine-sweepers in active commission	6	7,,        ,,     reserve		53	-    6	--60Aircraft carriers in active commission   ...	1	2,,         ,,      reserve		1	_    ]	-    3Tank vessels and oilers	32	97Sloop and gunboats in active commission	29	37,,           ,,      reserve ...	3	11	--32	-   48Monitors in active commission ...	...	,,      ,,    reserve   ...	...	9	_	--other craft ...	167	292Steam and motor-boats	1,297	1,912Total number of craft...	2,101	2,740The principal changes are:         -(1.) The reduction in numbers of capital ships,(2.) The increase in auxiliary craft.such as mine-sweepers and oil-fuelling craft. (3.) The elimination of the cruiser and torpedo-boat.(4.) The great increase in the size and&apos; power of light cruisers and destroyers.Any comparison of the numbers of the light cruisers and destroyers is fallacious without an appreciation of the increase in size and power of vessels of those classes. The light cruiser of 1914, for example, had a displacement of 5,000 tons and a horse-power of 25,000; the modern light cruiser is of 10,000 tons and 60,000 horse-power. The destroyer of 1914 was of 980 tons displacement and 24,000 horse-power; the modern destroyer is 1,300 tons and 27,000 horse-power.25. As the result of the war there would appear to have been a complete change in the character of naval warfare. In 1914 the Navy was regarded as a vast hitting machine wherein gun-power and speed were the dominating elements. To-day the Navy is characterised by a substantial reduction in hitting power, while the element of defence or resisting power has assumed enhanced importance. The change appears to be due largely to the increased importance of the submarine, the development of the mine as an offensive weapon, and, to an extent not yet fully disclosed, to the use of aircraft. As an example we are informed that since 1914 our stock of mines has increased fourfold in number. In 1914 we had six mine-sweepers; to-day we have sixty.  In 1914 depth charges were unknown; to-day we have thousands.This tendency towards the development of the counter weapon and of defence measures will obviously be greatly increased in regard to anti-aircraft measures; for[9277] &quot; ^        . c
example, by the provision on capital and other vessels of increased anti-aircraft batteries, heavier and more extensive armour protection, new classes of ammunition, and improved range-finding and sighting instruments.26. a feature since the war is the greatly increased concentration of expenditure and scientific effort on the design of naval materiel. This policy is not confined to purely experimental work, but extends to original scientific research. In every field of engineering science as applied to naval warfare, energy and thought are being expended in the various naval establishments. A single example will show the increased complexity of materiel arising from the application of &quot;scientific develop-ments. The &quot; Diomede,&quot; a light cruiser of 10,000 tons now completed at the Dock-yard, possesses a greater mileage of electrical wiring than our greatest pre-war battleship, the &quot; Queen Elizabeth,&quot; of 28,000 tons.27. The increased application of scientific discoveries to naval materiel results in increased complexity and entails increased staff in practically every department, for these complexities do not affect the technical staffs alone. If, for example, great importance is attached to the development of mines and mining, the research, design, experimental, technical and mining departments must be increased. If, concur-rently, it is decided to hold in stock four times as many mines the store-keeping staffs and re-inspection staffs must be correspondingly augmented. Further, as a result of concentration on new mine design, contracts for new experimental units must be placed,. As the work is new such contracts must be on a cost basis. That increases the work of the Contracts Branch and, at a later stage, of the Accountant-General&apos;s Branch. As a rough indication of the degree of increased complexity of materiel it may be mentioned that the number of ledger headings for Naval Stores in 1914 was 33,450; to-day it is 76,165.28. Generally, we conclude that one of the main reasons for the increased staffs is the direct and natural result of changes in the methods of naval warfare characterised by enhanced complexity of weapons, the new importance attached to defence weapons and measures, and to more intense concentration on the scientific development of new naval weapons and measures.29. In addition to the many and varied causes which, as we have shown, contribute to the increase of staffs, there is a further consideration which affects all the fighting services. So long as there is unrest in India, Egypt and the mandated territories, and so long as international complications such as have recently arisen in the Near East are hanging over us, the efficient and economical reorganisation and reconstitution of our fighting forces and their establishments on a peace basis is impossible. The menace of war definitely makes for additional expense and is destructive of economy. ,30. It is with all these varied considerations before us that we approach the detailed problems involved in our task. We possess a full and sympathetic apprecia-tion of the difficult position of the Lords of the Admiralty who, on the one hand, must have regard to the supreme necessity for national economy, and, on the other hand, must realise the grave responsibilities laid upon them for the efficiency of the main defence of the Empire. But we recommend that it should be impressed upon all holding positions of responsibility that, in the interests of economy, it is their imperative duty to exercise unceasing vigilance and to subject every item of expenditure to the closest scrutiny with a view to cutting off everything that is not necessary.general Structure and Organisation of the Admiralty Office.31. The Admiralty consists of a large number of independent self-contained Directorates arranged &quot;in groups under the superintendence of individual Members of the Board of Admiralty. The Directorates are organised to perform certain functions relating to particular objectives. Co-ordination of their activities is secured by the passage of papers and) personal consultation between these numerous independent Directorates, and by a system of co-operative working evolved by experience. It is a system which appears effectively to fulfil its purpose, but m our opinion tends somewhat towards redundancy of staff and duplication of work.
32. In 1914 the Board of Admiralty was constituted as follows: One 1st Lord One Civil Lord One Parliamentary Secretary One 1st Sea Lord ... One 2nd Sea Lord ... One 3rd Sea Lord ... One 4th Sea Lord ... One additional Civil Lord*3 Parliamentary representatives.1 Naval Staff representative.1 Personnel representative.1 Materiel and Equipment representative.1 Stores and Victualling representative.Contracts and Dockyards Administration.In 1922 the Board of Admiralty is constituted as follows : One 1st Lord One Civil LordOne     Parliamentary     andFinancial Secretary One First Sea Lord One Deputy Chief of naval staff   ... One Assistant Chief of naval staff.........One 2nd Sea Lord ... One 3rd Sea Lord ... One 4th Sea Lord ... One Permanent Secretary*3 Parliamentary representatives.J* 3 Naval Staff representatives.1 Personnel representative, 1 Materiel and Equipment representative. 1 Stores and Victualling representative. 1 Secretarial and Finance representative.As will he seen, the main changes have been to treble the representation of Staff and give the Secretary a place on the Board.33. Apart from the collective responsibility of the Board of Admiralty as a whole, the executive responsibility is apportioned! between the Members of the Board in apparently unequal proportions.While responsibility is not entirely to be measured by the relative size of staffs, the staffs may reasonably be taken as a rough guide. The following table shows the number of officers and officials receiving salaries in excess of  1,000 per annum under different Members of the Board : 	Over	Other		 1,000.	Staff.	Totals.Under the 1st Sea Lord	59	82	141Under the 2nd Sea Lord	28	61	89Under the 3rd Sea Lord	90	713	803Under the 4th Sea Lord	10	229	239Under the Secretary ...	38	1,704:	1,742Under the Civil Lord	6	145	151Totals   ...	231	2,934	3,16534. The following table shows the Directorates under each Member, and here again the inequality in distribution is further shown :- iDirectorates under the 1st Sea Lord Operations.

Victualling.Civil Lord- -Civil Engineer-in-Chief.Secretary  &apos;Secretary&apos;s Department. Dockyard Expense Accounts. Contracts and Purchases. Accountant-General.35. The extreme cases are obviously those of the Third Sea Lord, who has under his direct charge, without the help of a Deputy, no fewer than eleven Directorates, of which at least six have large staffs and deal with great technical problems, and the Fourth and Civil Lords, who have respectively two and one Directorate under their care.36. The number and relative importance of these Directorates requires consideration. The larger the number of independent Directorates, the greater will be the amount of paper work and the slower the progress of any specific transaction. The elevation of a section into a division with an independent Director tends to increase the numbers of the staff and to raise their grading. Further, the greater the number of Directors dealing with the Member of the Board, the greater must be his individual burden. It is clear also that the Directorates now in existence differ widely in importance.. For example, the Directorate of Naval Ordnance a technical Departmentof vastcomplexity and importance may be compared with the Directorate -of the Paymaster Service with a staff of three officers and two subordinate officials. Yet the head of the,Ordnance Directorate is a Captain, R.N., with a salary of  1,698, and the head of the Paymaster Service is a Paymaster Rear-Adimiral with a salary of  1,880 per annum. In view of the difference in the degree of responsibility of Directors, we recommend that these appointments be graded, as is done at the War Office, a fixed salary being assigned to each appointment, instead of granting to the holders the naval pay and allowances of their rank.37. Appendix II shows a, chart of the existing organisation of the Admiralty, and Appendix III, the form it would assume if the suggestions and recommendations we make in different sections of this report are adopted.38. Before passing to the consideration of the Departments in detail, we take this opportunity of referring to a factor which plays a substantial part in making the cost of the Admiralty staff high. It applies generally: to the Admiralty Office and to Admiralty establishments; but we shall take the Department of the Third Sea Lord as an example.  The Third Sea Lord has under his control eleven directorates, of
which six are great technical Departments. Two of these the Directorate of Naval Construction and the Directorate of Electrical Engineering are staffed by civilians. The Engineer-in-Chiefs Departments, the Directorate of Naval Ordnance and the Directorate of Torpedoes and Mining, are staffed by Naval Officers, while in the case of the sixth that of the Director of Dockyards the staff is composed of Naval Officers and civilians. The salaries paid for equivalent work and responsibility are much higher in the case of the naval personnel than in the case of the civil officials, and in this way higher cost is incurred. In addition, the Naval Officers are in almost all cases appointed to the Admiralty for a period of two years, although in certain cases this rule is not rigidly adhered to. Such a system is both costly and inefficient. No private business could exist successfully if its directing officials were regularly changed every two years. It was submitted to us that it was essential that the point of view of the user should be strongly represented in the technical Departments of the Admiralty, whatever the additional cost involved or whatever the other disadvantages may be.39. We recognise that it is necessary for the officers in the technical Departments of the Admiralty to have recent sea experience, and for close touch to be maintained between the Admiralty and the fleet; but we consider that the principle is now carried too far. We therefore confine ourselves to suggesting that before Naval Officers on the active list are appointed to posts at the Admiralty, the duties of which could be discharged with equal efficiency by civilian agency, consideration should be given to the possibility of appointing a retired Naval Officer or a civilian. We further recommend that, in future, officers on the active list should be appointed to the Admiralty for periods of not less than three years.40. We also desire to point out another feature of Admiralty practice which tends to increase the cost of the staffs. There is a more or less rigid rule that in the executive branch no Officer under the rank of Commander shall be appointed to the Admiralty. As these officers usually receive the pay and allowances of their rank, the consequence is that few Naval Officers on the active list employed at the Admiralty receive a lower salary than  1,000 per annum. We consider this to be an unduly expensive practice, and suggest that consideration should be given to the possibility of employing more officers of junior rank at the Admiralty.Private Secretaries and Naval Assistants.41. Before passing to the departments under the Second Sea Lord, we draw attention to some considerations in regard to private secretaries and naval assistants to the Lords of the Admiralty.In 1914 the Eirst Sea Lord had-1 Naval assistant (Captain R.N.).1 Private secretary (Junior Clerk, Class I).Now he has 1 Naval assistant (Captain R.N.).1 Private secretary (Paymaster Captain).1 Private secretary (Paymaster Lieutenant).In 1914 the Second Sea Lord had  1 Naval assistant (Captain R.N.). 1 Naval assistant (Commander R.N.). 1 Private secretary (Junior Clerk, Class I).To-day he has 1 Naval assistant (Captain R.N.).1 Naval assistant (Engineer Rear-Admiral).2 Naval assistants (Commanders R.N.).1 Naval assistant (Engineer-Captain).1 Naval assistant (Paymaster Lieutenant-Commander). -1 Private secretary (Paymaster Commander).In 1914 the Third Sea Lord had-1 Naval assistant (Captain R.N.). 1 Private secretary (Junior Clerk, Class I).
whioh six are great technical Departments. Two of these the Directorate of Naval Construction and the Directorate of Electrical Engineering are staffed by civilians. The Engineer-in-Chiefs Departments, the Directorate of Naval Ordnance and the Directorate of Torpedoes and Mining, are staffed by Naval Officers, while in the case of the sixth that of the Director of Dockyards the staff is composed of Naval Officers and civilians. The salaries paid for equivalent work and responsibility are much higher in the case of the naval personnel than in the case of the civil officials, and in this way higher cost is incurred. In addition, the Naval Officers are in almost all cases appointed to the Admiralty for a period of two years, although in certain cases this rule is not rigidly adhered to. Such a system is both costly and inefficient. No private business could exist successfully if its directing officials were regularly changed every two years. It was submitted to us that it was essential that the point of view of the user should be strongly represented in the technical Departments of the Admiralty, whatever the additional cost involved or whatever the other disadvantages may be.39. We recognise that it is necessary for the officers in the technical Departments of the Admiralty to have recent sea experience, and for close touch to be maintained between the Admiralty and the fleet; but we consider that the principle is now carried too far. We therefore confine ourselves to suggesting that before Naval Officers on the active list are appointed to posts at the Admiralty, the duties of which could be discharged with equal efficiency by civilian agency, consideration should be given to the possibility of appointing a retired; Naval Officer or a civilian. We further recommend that, in future, officers on the active list should be appointed to the Admiralty for periods of not less than three years.40. We also desire to point out another feature of Admiralty practice which tends to increase the cost of the staffs. There is a more or less rigid rule that in the executive branch no Officer under the rank of Commander shall be appointed to the Admiralty. As these officers usually receive the pay and! allowances of their rank, the consequence is that few Naval Officers on the active list employed at the Admiralty receive a lower salary than  1,000 per annum. We consider this to be an unduly expensive practice, and suggest that consideration should be given to the possibility of employing more officers of junior rank at the Admiralty.Private Secretaries and Naval Assistants.41. Before passing to the departments under the Second Sea Lord, we draw attention to some considerations in regard to private secretaries and naval assistants to the Lords of the Admiralty.In 1914 the First Sea Lord had -1 Naval assistant (Captain E.N.).1 Private secretary (Junior Clerk, Class I).Now he has 1 Naval assistant (Captain R.N.).1 Private secretary (Paymaster Captain).1 Private secretary (Paymaster Lieutenant).In 1914 the Second Sea Lord had 1 Naval assistant (Captain R.N.).1 Naval assistant (Commander R.N.).1 Private secretary (Junior Clerk, Class I).To-day he has 1 Naval assistant (Captain R.N.).1 Naval assistant (Engineer Rear-Admiral).2 Naval assistants (Commanders R.N.).1 Naval assistant (Engineer-Captain).1 Naval assistant (Paymaster Lieutenant-Commander). -1 Private secretary (Paymaster Commander).In 1914 the Third Sea Lord had-1 Naval assistant (Captain R.N.). 1 Private secretary (Junior Clerk, Class I).
Now he has-1 Private secretary (Paymaster Lieutenant-Commander).In 1914 the Fourth Sea Lord had 1 Private secretary (Junior Clerk, Class I).Now he has 1 Private secretary (Paymaster Captain). 1 Private secretary (Paymaster Lieutenant).In addition, now the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff has 1 Private secretary (Paymaster Lieutenant-Commander).The Assistant Chief of Naval Staff has-1 Secretary (Paymaster Lieutenant-Commander). 1 Naval assistant (Commander R.N.).The Naval Secretary to the First Sea Lord now has  1 Private secretary (Paymaster Lieutenant).42. The Private Secretaries to the Sea Lords in 1914 were highly trained and experienced Civil Servants. They are now naval officers, usually of the Paymaster class, and their numbers have greatly increased. We appreciate that in some ways it may be convenient for newly appointed Lords of the Admiralty to choose as their sectaries Paymasters who have already been closely associated with them at sea, and who, by virtue of their training as Paymasters, adapt themselves more readily than other naval officers to the functions of private secretary. On the other hand, we must point out that this policy is very costly. For example, the Fourth Sea Lord has as a private secretary a Paymaster Captain receiving  1,388 per annum, a sum representing 69 per cent, of the Fourth Sea Lord&apos;s own salary. Moreover, we are doubtful if Paymaster Officers have the best training or experience for secretarial work in the Admiralty. They come to the Admiralty without experience of the Office, its organisation or methods, and they are obviously in this respect handicapped in comparison with the permanent CivikServant under the old system. Nowhere else, either in official or in private life, are private secretaries so highly paid as in the Admiralty, and we are unable to find justification for the practice that has grown up of recent years of employing senior officers of the Paymaster class on secretarial duties.It appears to us that there is a strong case for reversion to the pre-war practice, and we recommend that the Admiralty should review the entire establishment of Private Secretaries to members of the Board of Admiralty and others in order to ensure that the cost to the nation is reduced and is brought more into line with the. practice in other Government Departments and in civil life.43. The Estimates of 1922/23 show that the number of naval assistants has increased from five to eight, the increase being almost entirely in the office of the Second Sea Lord. The naval assistants of the Second Sea Lord and the other naval officers shown as attached to his office should not, however, be regarded as naval assistants in the ordinary sense, for they are definitely responsible for keeping the records of officers and for work connected with the posting and promotion and retire-men t of officers up to the rank of commander. To avoid confusion we suggest that the naval officers employed on those duties should be shown separately in the Annual Estimates and Navy List as the staff of the Office of the Second Sea Lord. We under-stand that certain reductions have recently taken place in the number of Naval Assis-tants, and it is our view that the Admiralty should take every step possible to reduce the number of appointments of highly paid officers working by themselves without executive responsibility for specific departments.Department of ^the First Sea Lord.44. In addition to his supreme responsibility for the organisation, distribution and fighting efficiency of the fleet, the First Sea Lord is Chief of the Naval Staff. In 1914 the Naval Staff consisted of 24 officers and 18 civilian, subordinates. To-day it consists of 68 officers and 71 civilian subordinates.  The Divisions of the Naval Staff
are distributed between the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff and the Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff immediately controls the Plans, Operations, Local Defence, Trade and Intelligence Divisions, and the Assis-tant Chief of the Naval Staff controls the Staff Duties, Gunnery, Torpedo and Mining Divisions and the Air, Tactical and Historical Sections. Appendix II shows the organisation in 1914 and 1922. A complete change has taken place in this Department, for the experience of the war has shown the great importance of staff work, and the need for the more complete preparation of war plans. The Naval Staff therefore now. performs functions for which previously inadequate provision was made. An increase in the Naval Staff necessitates additions to the establishments of other Departments of the Admiralty. Almost every Head of Department stated that additional work was imposed upon him by the activities of the Naval Staff. The Naval Staff requires data and information from practically all the other Departments of the Admiralty, and its proposals have to be put to the test of practical criticism and review by those Departments, and thus more work is entailed. It may be said that the Naval Staff is the channel through which the imagination of the thinking Naval Officer is expressed. The plea for increased thinking Departments causes us to review the origin of the really big advances or steps in modern naval materiel. The &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was not the product of a Naval Staff. The turbine, the watertube boiler and fire control were the work of those outside the staff Department, and we are by no means convinced that, as was suggested to us, the inefficiency of the fuzes of armour-piercing shell would necessarily have been detected beforehand by the existence of a Naval Staff. While we are of opinion that the value of an efficient Naval Staff cannot be exaggerated, we believe that its value is to be measured rather by its quality than its numbers.45. In reviewing the Naval Staff organisation, we have formed the impression that the creation of a number of small divisions to which is assigned the special study of individual weapons-i.e., the Gunnery and Torpedo Divisions has disadvantages, as it must tend to overlapping between those divisions and the technical departments responsible for Ordnance and Torpedoes. Carried to its logical conclusion there seems to be no reason why the system should not lead to the creation of special divisions of the Naval Staff to deal with naval construction, propelling machinery and electrical gear. There is a staff aspect of every form of naval materiel, and it would appear to us that to ensure successful staff work it is essential rather that there should be the closest co-operation between the staff and technical branches than that special divisions of the Naval Staff should be created to deal with particular weapons.46. We appreciate that there are two points of view to be considered  one of the tactical use of the weapon, and the other its design, construction and supply; the demarcation line between them is a broad one, and under the present organisation overlapping clearly takes place. Both the Gunnery Division of the Naval Staff and the Staff of the Director of Naval Ordnance are composed of picked naval officers with recent sea experience; and we are satisfied that a capable Director of Naval Ordnance and his staff must always have in front of them from their own knowledge and experience the potential uses and develop-ments in the weapons which they are called upon to design and construct. The same remarks apply equally to torpedoes and mines.The compilation andi criticism of gunnery and torpedo records, the prepara-tion of schemes for practices and the preparation of training manuals are legitimate staff functions; but their proper place in the organisation is under the Director of Training and Staff Duties. We accordingly recommend that the Gunnery and Torpedo Divisions be abolished and that the essential Staff Duties now performed by these Directorates be transferred to the Training and Staff Duties Division.47. The Local Defence Division formed part of the watr organisation of the Admiralty, and its continued existence as a separate division seems hardly necessary. We consider that the functions now performed by this division could be carried out by Operations and Plans Divisions.48. The Trade Division is similarly part of the war organisation. It is particularly concerned with plans for the control and protection of merchant shipping in a great war, and with economic questions connected with naval operations. This division collects commercial and economic statistics. There is unlimited scope for thought and work in regard to protective measures, and it is obvious that a
Naval Staff could, from the purely.naval point of view, justify great preparations. This division, in dealing with economic effects of blockades, is, in our opinion, doing work which could be carried out, and prior to the war would necessarily have been carried out, by the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, and we consider those departments should be responsible for the supply of information of this kind. The employment of expert naval officers on this kind of work appears to us inexpedient. One officer on the staff of the Plans Division should be able to maintain a skeleton scheme as a foundation on which the organisation that would be required in a great war could be built up.49. We recommend that the Directorates of the Naval Staff should be reduced to four, viz. : (1) Operations, (2) Plans, (3) Intelligence, and! (4) Training and Staff Duties, and that they should be under the direct control of the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff.The Naval Staff is now represented on the Board of Admiralty by three members, the Chief of the Naval Staff, the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff, and Assistant; Chief of the Naval Staff. We recommend that the Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff should cease to be a member of the Board and that he should have charge of Training and Staff Duties with the status of a Director.The adoption of the suggestions we have outlined above should make it possible for the Admiralty to effect a substantial reduction in numbers and grading of the Naval Staff.Department of the Hydrographer.50. The staff of the Hydrographer&apos;s Department was 80 in 1913/14 and 165 in 1922/23. This Department differs from other Admiralty Departments inasmuch as a considerable proportion of its activities partake of the nature of a business. It is a revenue-earning Department, due to the sale of the various publications of the chart branch. At the same time it is a costly organisation. The average total emolument of the naval officers employed is  1,134 per annum, while their number represents one such officer to every five draughtsmen or civilians. The increase since 1914 in officers employed is explained by additional work brought about by the following causes; additional data arising from the growth of foreign hydrographic offices, involving close scrutiny and sifting before embodiment in British charts and in directions to mariners; a substantial increase in advisory work to the Board of Admiralty and naval staff in regard! to navigation; additional data and strategic charts required by the naval staff; a full and. better service in the form of supply of sailing directions; an enhanced degree of detail in information contained in notices to mariners; a new basis for tidal work. The increase in the civilian staff is associated with the foregoing increased activities, but in the case of those concerned in chart production, the hydrographer indicated a certain lack of balance, resulting in hampered output, due to his difficulty in obtaining skilled cartographers and the consequent necessity for employing additional draughtsmen. The general result was that&apos; the output per head was not as good as in 1914. In the Chart Department in particular there appears to be a great accumulation of unused information, the inheritance of many years. Pre-war Committees have reported on this accumulation, and recommended that additional staff should be provided to deal with it.51. We have come to the conclusion that this problem should be dealt with by the preparation of a much more definite programme of work to be undertaken in a specified period than has hitherto obtained, and that a thorough investigation should be made of the staff required to carry out such a programme. We are informed that in spite of the accumulation of data not yet embodied in the charts, the general safety of navigation has steadily improved and the general service rendered by the Department to the Navy and to the Mercantile Marine is unquestioned. In view of this we consider that no additional cost should be incurred, but the laying down of a definite programme of work should result in greater economy, efficiency and service. We think that a close review should be made by the Admiralty of the officer establish-ment of the Department with a view to its reduction by the elimination of the addi-tional work in regard to navigation, which has involved the large increase since 1914.52. We draw attention to the inadequacy of the accommodation occupied by the chart production department. The rooms are badly lighted, cramped and unsuit-able for drawing office practice. Further, the location of this department in the Admiralty building entails unnecessary cost from the rental point of view.
The Department oe the Second Sea Lord.53. The Second Sea Lord is responsible for the manning of the Fleet and for the training of the Fleet in accordance with the principles approved by the Chief of the Naval Staff. He is also responsible for administrative arrangements connected with barracks and training and educational establishments.Educational and Training Establishments.54. With the exception of the War College and Staff College at Greenwich, which are under the Chief of the Naval Staff, all educational and training establish-ments are administered by the Second Sea Lord.The educational and training establishments include :-Royal Naval College, Greenwich.Naval Staff College, Greenwich.Naval War College, Greenwich.Royal Naval Engineering College, Keyham.Royal Naval College, Dartmouth.Dockyard schools at home and abroad.Training establishments for specialist officers and ratings.In addition, the Second Sea Lord is responsible for the Fleet educational staff and for the Headquarter office of the Adviser on Education. The total cost of the educational services in 1914 was  156,000; the estimate figure for 1922 was  411,000. The broad explanation of the difference is the complexity of weapons and of the services generally involving more elaborate training and education.55. Before dealing with the establishments in detail, we desire to refer to an important question of principle which has come to our notice. Before the war, the Second Sea Lord was responsible for the efficiency of the personnel of the Fleet and for its training. During the war the naval staff was entirely reorganised and the Chief of the Naval Staff is now charged with responsibility for laying down the principles for the training of the Fleet. The Second Sea Lord informed us that in consequence of this change the control of the Staff College and War College Sections of the Royal Naval College at Greenwich are entirely under the control of the Naval Staff. y56. In the War Office the General Staff and not the Adjutant-GeneraFs Depart-ment are now responsible for all aspects of education and training and exercise super-vision over all educational and training establishments.We are not prepared to express an opinion as to whether the organisation of the Board of Admiralty lends itself to a similar, divorce of responsibility for training and education from the department that is responsible for the personnel of the Fleet. It may be that it will be more satisfactory under the Admiralty organisation for the Naval Staff merely to lay down in broad outline the general requirements in regard to training and for the Second Sea Lord to remain responsible as at present for the details of the courses of instruction and for the administration of the education and training establishments, except the Staff College and War College mentioned above. We understand that a Committee is now sitting at the Admiralty to consider this question. We make no recommendation in regard to this matter, but we strongly urge that if any changes are made in existing arrangements care should be taken to ensure that there is no duplication of work, and that the full effect of the changes in regard to economies of staff is realised.Royal Naval College, Greenwich.57. This establishment is virtually the University of the Navy; and the Naval Staff College and War College are sections of it added since 1914.  In 1914 there were on the staff 20 naval officers in addition to the civil staff.  Now there are [9277] d.We suggest that the hydro-graphical department should be removed to cheaper and more suitable premises, and that the accommodation thus set free should be allotted to departments now outside the Admiralty, which from the standpoint of administrative efficiency it is desirable to locate in the main office, e.g., the Contracts Department.
381 naval officers. The total cost in 1914 was  42,800; now it is  126&apos;,000. Primarily the increase is due to the employment of additional naval officer instructors, to the higher rates of pay, and to the addition of the two new sections.We are gratified to learn that it has recently been arranged that the President of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, shall perform the functions of Admiral in Charge of the War College in addition to his other duties, and that a reduction of establishment of one Admiral has thereby been effected. We suggest for consideration that further economy might be effected by the abolition of the appointment of Captain of the College.58. When we analyse the details of the professorial staff we are again struck by the costliness of naval officers. For example, the civilian Professor of Mathematics receives  600 a year plus bonus, while one of his assistants is a Lieutenant-Commander receiving  936. The civilian Professor of Applied Mechanics receives  648 a year plus bonus, while the Assistant Professor, an Instructor Captain, R.N., receives  1,224.In the Navigation Branch there are seven naval officers receiving an average of over  1,000 per annum each.We are also impressed by the sum allowed for wages of general mess staffs, which is now  21,600, as against  5,800 in 1914.These matters require close scrutiny by the Admiralty, and we recommend that the practice of using naval officers for professorial work be given up where practicable.We also direct attention to the cost of the Naval War College staff. It consists of one Admiral, who is now also President of Greenwich College, and five Captains, remunerated at  9,305. Lecturing forms the main feature of the training, and the number of officers carrying out courses at one time is only twenty. The allowance of one instructor to four students appears excessive and should be immediately reconsidered.Royal Naval Engineering College, Keyham, 59. We make no recommendations.Royal Naval College, Dartmouth.60. We are glad to learn that as result of a Committee appointed by the Admiralty to review the expenditure at Dartmouth, savings to the extent of  44,000 per annum will be achieved.Mining and Signal School.61. The&apos;Estimates of 1922/23 show a cost of  126,000. We have been unable to visit this establishment or to review the work being done in it. We are accordingly unable in this Report to deal with: that establishment; but we propose in our Report on the War Office to deal generally with the technical establishments of the Services.Educational Staff for the Fleet.62. The staff of Naval Instructor Officers for the Fleet in 1914 numbered 19; to-day they number 54. Headmasters, Senior Masters, and Schoolmasters, numbered 70 in 1914; to-day they number 135. The strength, in Schoolmasters has thus been approximately doubled, and the strength in Naval Instructor Officers approximately trebled. Pay alone for the educational staff has gone up from  17,400 per annum to  70,500. The strength of the personnel of the Fleet has in the same period been reduced by 32 per cent. In explanation of this increase we were informed that a definite policy has been adopted of affording better educational opportunities to the Fleet. The total sum involved appears large, but if applied to the Fleet as a whole it is only slightly in excess of  1 per man per annum. We have no evidence of the value to the Navy of better opportunities for education, but there can be no doubt of the national value of better education to the. seaman on his return to civil life. We hesitate to express any view on the justification for this additional expenditure, but at a time like the present when economy must be practised by scrutinising every channel of expenditure, the policy in regard to this item should be reconsidered with the object of reducing cost.
63. In general, as regards training establishments, we suggest that by a more intensive utilisation of these establishments, by reducing leave and the periods between courses a larger output could be secured for the same overhead costs.Directorate of Recruiting.64. The actual recruiting staff was 186 in 1914; 56 in 1922. The staff in this establishment is thus substantially below pre-war strength, and appears quite in keeping with the reduced recruiting rate.  We have no suggestion to make.Medical Department.65..The Headquarter staff in 1913/14 was 24; in 1922/23, 33.. The increase in staff is due to the creation of a Dental Branch since 1914, and to the addition of one officer for health and preventive measures. We have no suggestions to make in regard to Headquarter staff.Dealing with the Medical Services generally, the actual number of Medical Officers in 191.4 was 521; to-day it is 414. The latter figure does hot include 33 new Dental Officers.We note that the proportion of medical officers to the strength of the Navy is 1 to 238, as compared with 1 to 280 before the war. We recommend that the number of medical officers should be carefully watched and no increase should be permitted.A small establishment is maintained at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, for the manufacture of vaccines and drugs for the use of the Navy. The War Office maintain a similar establishment on a larger scale in connection with the Royal Army Medical College, Millbank. We recommend that the establishment at Greenwich be abolished, and that the Admiralty should in future obtain the vaccines, &amp;c, required for the Navy from the military establishment at Millbank.Directorate of the Paymaster-Director-General.66. In 1914 there existed no independent Headquarters Directorate for the Paymaster Branch, although a departmental committee had reported that its constitution was advisable. Any general work, including postings and appoint-ments, required at Headquarters in connection with the branch was then carried out by a Paymaster-Commander in the office of the Second Sea Lord.To-day at Headquarters there is a Directorate consisting of 3 highly-paid officers and 2 civilians. Since 1914 certain additional functions have been laid on the Pay-master Service. For example, new responsibilities for catering, associated with the improved messing of the men, and new storekeeping duties, and thirdly additional coding duties on Flagships. In 1914 the actual number of Paymasters borne was 757. On the 1st September, 1922, the number borne was 578, and the number was in process of reduction to a new establishment of 550.In 1914 there were 99 Paymasters employed on secretarial duties and 651 on ship accounting duties. In 1922, 141 Paymasters are employed on secretarial duties and 395 on ship duties, while 14 are seconded for duty with Dominion navies and Royal Air Force. While we agree that a stronger staff at Headquarters may possibly have secured certain indirect economies in the utilisation of Paymasters afloat, we do not consider, in view of &quot;the reduced strength of the Paymaster Service generally,, and of the decreased proportion of Paymaster Officers now used for ships&apos; duties, that a separate and independent Directorate with a highly-graded staff is justified&apos;.67. We recommend that this Directorate be abolished and that the work required should be carried out by an officer under the Second Sea Lord, of not higher rank than Paymaster-Captain.Any functions now performed by the Department of the Paymaster-Director-General in connection with the messing arrangements of the Fleet should be handed over to the Director of Victualling.Admiral Commanding Coastguards and Reserves.68. The staff of the Department of the Admiral Commanding Coastguards and Reserves was: Numbers . ... Cost1914. 17 6,980/1922.-   27  18,325[9277]D&apos;2
As the entire Coastguard Service is now being reorganised and reduced, it is presumed that its Headquarters Department will also be reviewed. In the meantime, however, we consider that it offers some ground for criticism, particularly in regard to the composition of its staff. The staff&apos; has grown from 8 officers to 14 since 1914. We were informed that since the war this Department has become responsible for. the inspection of trawlers and for the conduct of examinations of engine-room ratings on entry, but we do not consider that those new duties justify so large an increase of staff. The total staff is 27, which includes 13 clerks. The Department exists as an independent Directorate in charge of a Vice-Admiral at a salary of approximately  3,000 per annum. He has a Secretary at  950 per annum, 4 officers receiving over  1,000 a year each, and 5 over  850 a year each, performing duties which do not appear to us to involve either great responsibility or extended experience and training. Much of the work could, we believe, be equally efficiently carried out by a civilian staff at much less cost. We recommend that this Directorate be abolished and that the work be dealt with as a section of the Mobilisation Directorate with a Chief of the rank of Captain, E.N.Department of Third Sea Lord.69. Before dealing with the group of Departments over which the Third Sea Lord exercises superintendence, we wish to record our impression that he is charged with an unduly heavy burden of responsibility. The Third Sea Lord not only superintends a greater number of Departments with larger staffs than any other Naval Member of the Board, but in addition these Departments deal with technical problems associated with materiel which, owing to the progress of science, are of greater importance and complexity than ever before. We are convinced that under to-day1 s conditions the duties of the Controller or Third Sea Lord are so heavy as to make it necessary to afford him some relief. Under the present arrangements the Third Sea Lord is responsible for every branch of technical activity which contributes to the production and delivery of a completely-equipped warship. We realise the great danger and difficulty of attempting to divide this responsibility between two Departments, and we do not recommend any such division of responsibility, but confine our recommendation to modification of the present organisation with the object of relieving the Controller of routine work..70. We are impressed with the vast scope of the work covered by the relatively large number of Directorates separately and independently responsible to the Third Lord himself without the assistance of a Deputy. Each of these Directorates is charged with responsibility for a definite part of the materiel that goes to make up the complete ship. The final objective of the Departments taken together is the delivery of a complete warship ready for sea and its maintenance as an effective fighting unit.The conception of a complete ship is something more than the mere assembly of the units of materiel provided by the several Departments. The units must be co-ordinated and someone must be made responsible for the provision of any items of work not specifically allocated to one of the main technical Departments. At present this duty is assigned to the Director of Naval Equipment.71. We recommend that a new appointment of Deputy Controller be created charged with the duty of dealing finally with minor matters connected with materiel, in particular, fittings and equipment. We recommend that the Directorate of Naval Equipment be abolished, and that its essential functions be discharged by the Deputy Controller with two or three assistants.Directorate of Naval Ordnance. Directorate of Torpedoes and Mining. Directorate of Armament Supply. Directorate of Signals.72. These four Directorates were each given an independent status during the war. In 1914 they were included in a.single Directorate of^Naval Ordnance. It is submitted to us that the increased scope and complexity of&quot;their functions justifies their continued separation in peace time.   In 1914 the Director of Naval Ordnance
was responsible for the design, experiment, supply, inspection, storage, and issue of ordnance, ammunition, gun-mountings, torpedoes, mines and -wireless apparatus required by the Navy. The Directorate was only in process of taking over the design and inspection of ordnance and ammunition from the War Office, and consequently it is difficult to make an accurate comparison of the numbers and cost of the staff. Subject to that qualification, the Estimates for 1913/14 and 1922/23 are as follows: Numbers.      Cost. 1913/14     ...        .......        109 33,5631922/23     ......        ...        269        133,000At present the four Directorates are responsible, not only for the functions performed before the war, but also for such new and additional subjects as fire control, paravanes, mine-sweeping apparatus, submarine detection apparatus, &amp;c. The increased size of the total staffs reflects the increased complexity of naval weapons, but while we consider this justifies a substantial part of the increase, certain features appear to require modification.73. The Directorate of Armament Supply was formerly a branch of the Directorate of Naval Ordnance under a Superintendent of Ordnance Stores. War conditions brought the new Department into existence owing to the great increase in the volume of ordnance supplies dealt with, but, in addition, new functions were imposed upon this Directorate: that of production and the scrutiny of design from the point of view of economical production. In evidence, the Director stated that his Department was &quot;the Contractors&apos; representative at the Admiralty.&quot; The actual expenditure on armaments in 1913/14was  4,747,829,and in the Estimates for 1922/23 is  5,064,500, which, divided by two for difference in prices, is equivalent to a pre-war expenditure of  2,532,250. The purchases to-day are thus much smaller than in 1914. &apos; &apos; &apos;74. While we fully appreciate the necessity for a Munitions Production Department in a great war, and for the scrutiny of design in peace time, we are convinced that the latter functions can be, and are, performed by the Chief Inspector of Naval Ordnance and the Superintendent of Design of Naval Ordnance through the close touch which exists between these officers, their staffs and private contractors. We are not impressed with the argument that the design staff might produce a design with features which rendered its manufacture difficult, and that if they did so the scrutiny of Director of Armament Supplies would effect a satisfactory modification. The staff of the Director of Armament Supplies do not necessarily possess detailed knowledge of workshop practice. The only staff in the Admiralty coming into close touch with the processes of manufacture is the inspection staff under the Chief Inspector of Naval Ordnance. In our view, no staff should be specially allocated to the Department of the Director of Armament Supplies for the scrutiny of design. ,  .The Director of Armament Supplies further explained that he was responsible for the progress of outside contracts, but so also did Chief Inspector of Naval Ordnance, and it is obvious that the latter through his inspectors in the works can more conveniently record progress.75. The essential duties of the Director of Armament Supplies are storekeeping and the maintenance and issue of ordnance stores. We recommend that the Depart-ment of Armament Supply should cease to be a separate Directorate. The functions of scrutiny of design from the point of view. of production should no longer be discharged oy special officers in any department, but should be exercised in the course of their ordinary duties by the Inspection and Design Staffs. The Armament Supply Branch should be confined to. the duties of holding and issuing stores, and it should become a section of the Directorate of Naval Ordnance, and we see no reason why the head of this branch should not be a civilian. The Cordite and Torpedo Factories should also be placed under the Directorate of Naval Ordnance.76. In the. course of our investigations into the work of this group of Depart-ments, certain general questions of policy have impressed us. In the Ordnance and Mining depots over &apos;4,000 workers are employed in addition to the staffs.   This
number compares with 2,346 workers in 1914. The increase is explained by the increased complexity of weapons and ammunition, and by the necessity for reconditioning and re-examining the enormous stocks of surplus war stores that are being maintained. We inspected a naval ordnance depot and the work being carried on there, particularly the reconditioning of ammunition. It is work of a dangerous nature requiring great care and is necessarily costly. The amount of reconditioning to be done is obviously dependent on Admiralty policy in regard to the magnitude and nature of stocks to be held. Without more technical knowledge than we possess, we hesitate to express any strong views in regard to size of stocks or their composition, but the great increase in cost since 1914, together with the general impression we formed from our visit, prompts us to suggest that the Admiralty should again review their policy in regard to this question. We would particularly emphasise the case of guns held for arming merchant vessels and their ammunition, also the quantity and type of ammunition held for use against aircraft. We also draw attention to the repair and cleaning of small arms ammunition, and make the definite recommendation that this work should be discontinued in all Admiralty establishments and concentrated at whatever military establishment is engaged on similar work for the army. We may add that an inspection of an armament depot brings clearly to notice the importance of standardisation and reduction of the numbers of types and marks of guns and ammunition. We suggest that concurrently with the introduction of new types of weapons and ammunition every effort should- be made to accelerate the elimination of obsolescent types.77. Before the war wireless telegraphy was dealt with by the &quot; Vernon&quot; Torpedo School. Since 1914 the use of wireless telegraphy has increased and a separate signal school and a signal department at the Admiralty have been established.The Signal School is responsible for the training of personnel and for design and experimental work as regards materiel.The Signal Department at the Admiralty is closely associated with the Naval Staff and is also responsible for supply and production of materiel. Inspection of materiel supplied by contract is carried out by the Signal Department, but the contracts are made by the Contracts Department.We recommend that the Signal Department should cease to be a separate Directorate and should become a section of the Directorate of Torpedoes and Mines.Department of Director of Dockyards and the Royal Dockyards.78. The Royal Dockyards at home and abroad are controlled and administered by the Department of the Director of Dockyards who also acts as the link between the professional Departments of the Admiralty and the Dockyards.The staff in 1914 consisted of 2 officers and 33 civilians. It now consists of 4 officers and 69 civilians.79. In explanation of the increase, apart from the general reasons applying to all Departments, the Director of Dockyards claimed that a closer and keener supervision was now exercised over the working of the dockyards. Constant changes in the programme and policy in regard to dockyard work greatly increased, the work of his staff, also the new Naval Staff threw additional work upon them. Develop-ments in electrical engineering constituted heavy new. duties, and the extension of electrical equipment in the dockyards entailed more supervision.80. The Director of Dockyards dissented from the view that the. new fleet involved less repair and maintenance work than the pre-war fleet, and stated that craft were more numerous, their dimensions were larger, and complexity greater.We are glad to learn that the question of the number of civilians employed on fleet services is being closely examined by a Special Committee with a view to reduction.81. In regard to the dockyards at home and abroad, the following table shows the. comparative position:  .       -1913/14.      1922/23.Staff       ...     11...... 1,896 3,015Operatives ... ...        51,407        47,238The Director of Dockyards was of opinion that the dockyards had now to cope with 90 per cent, of their pre-war work. Although new construction was relatively
small, its cost was high, owing to changes in policy in regard to the rate of completion. We formed the impression that considerations connected with the incidence of unemployment affected the numbers of dockyard personnel, and that there is a definite risk that men are not always effectively employed. For example, certain light cruisers and destroyers were taken from contractors to the dockyards in an unfinished state, and frequent changes have been made in regard to their rate of completion^ If instructions were given to complete these vessels&apos; at the most economical rate, savings would be achieved &apos; and the&apos; vessels would have a longer useful life in the Navy. But if this course were adopted it would be necessary to discharge a number of men from the dockyards when the vessels are completed, if no new work is in sight. We recommend that instructions be given to complete the vessels at the most economical rate, and if there is no new work to take their place on their completion, that the establishment be reduced. The unemployment rate in the dockyard towns is by no means so high as in other shipbuilding centres.82. Further, the problem of more efficient organisation and working of these vast establishments, expending  6,500,000 per annum on operatives&apos; wages alone, offers a hopeful field for achieving substantial savings. The Director of Dockyards fully concurs in this, but the realisation of these savings can only follow the adoption of a more definite policy in regard to the future size and nature of the Navy than has been possible for the Admiralty to lay down in the past three years owing to the war aftermath, the Washington Conference, the uncertainty of the international situation and the embarrassment caused by the political exigencies of unemployment.83. We suggest that the Admiralty should appoint a Committee, which should include outside engineers and shipbuilders, to make a full investigation of dockyard administrative organisation and personnel with a view to improving the administration and effecting economies.84. The experience and lessons of war production gained in private firms and the economies in overhead charges and supervision, which have been necessitated by the recent pressure of economic conditions in private dockyards, should find their reflection in State establishments.85. Meantime we can endorse the view of the Geddes Committee that Pembroke Dockyard should be closed down and the services of the 1,200 men now employed there dispensed with, as there appears to be no likelihood of any development in the near future which would cause Pembroke to become useful as a naval dockyard. Similar action should be taken in regard to Sheerness Dockyard. The savings effected through the closing of two expensive establishments and the concentration of work in the others without an increase in overhead charges should be of a substantial nature. We also suggest that consideration should be given to the possibilities of reducing the establishment at Chatham Dockyard, by using it only for the repair of vessels for which its docking accommodation is essential.86. We suggest that a careful reconsideration of policy in regard to the number of ancillary craft held in reserve, especially mine-sweepers and small boats, should be made. Considerable economies could, we think, be realised if the dockyard craft were also subjected to a close scrutiny with a view to the reduction of their numbers.Department of Electrical Engineering.87. The staff of the Department of Electrical Engineering was 23 in 1914 and 98 in 1922. The increase of the staff of this Department is due to the extended use of electricity on board ship and to the complexity of the installations. We make no observations other than to indicate that in our opinion the rates of remuneration of the Electrical Engineering staff appear low in comparison with the rates in all tiie other Departments, Naval or civil, and under such conditions it is unlikely that an adequate number of the best men will be attracted to this important Department. We make no recommendations.Department of the Engineer-in-Chief.88, The staff of this Department was 52 in 1913/14 and 73 in 1922/23. The. directing staff now stands at approximately pre-war strength, although new
construction and overseeing has gone down substantially. The position is perhaps justified by the increased amount of development and by the scrutiny of new design, while we are assured by the Engineer-in-Chief that no additional staff will be required to deal with the two new battleships.   We make no recommendations.Department of Scientific Research.89. The Department of Scientific Eesearch is a new addition to the Admiralty Establishment of 1914, and is the result of the new policy under which the Navy carries out original scientific research on matters of potential importance to the service. If the wisdom of this policy is accepted and we see no reason to question it the question becomes one of the amount of money which should be allotted to the Depart-ment. In our view, this is emphatically a case where a definite sum should be allotted to the service in the Annual Estimates. This service represents an invest-ment, the yield from which is directly dependent upon the zeal and ability of the personnel of the Department. The only check on its work is that obtained from an annual review of its performance.The present system of Estimates does not conveniently disclose the sum budgeted. We recommend that in future Estimates the details of the expenditure for Scientific Research should be separately shown. The present system devised by the Director, under which a priority programme of research is prepared in consultation with the Technical Departments, and then approved by the First Sea Lord, appears to us satisfactory. It would have been part of our recommendation that the pooling of the scientific staffs at the out-stations under the Headquarters Directorate should be brought about, but we believe this policy has been already adopted by the Admiralty. We suggest that close attention be paid to co-ordination with other Research Departments to avoid overlapping, and this matter should be constantly kept before the Director of the Department.Compass Department.90. The staff of the Compass Department was 4 in 1914 and 15 in 1922. The increase is primarily due to the Change in the character and scope of the work dealt with. In 1914 the Navy used magnetic compasses supplied by private contractors, and the Compass Department was a small inspection and store-holding body. To-day the Navy use Gyro compasses, which are scientific instruments of considerable complexity, the further development of which is still proceeding. The Navy possesses large stocks of these compasses made during the war, and new supplies will not be required for some time to come.The Establishment at Slough reconditions, repairs and inspects all Gyro compasses and such magnetic compasses as are required. Further, a considerable amount of experimental work is carried out which will result in the development of greatly-improved types. The Department also designs, repairs, reconditions, stores, and issues compasses for the Royal Air Force, and during the war they carried out the same functions for compasses for the Army tanks.We recommend that the. Fighting Services should arrange that this Department at Slough should carry out all compass work for all three services. We note that in this Establishment there are five Expense Account clerks. This number appears unduly high; and this matter should be dealt with by the Committee now investigating Expense Accounts.Gyro Research.91. In addition to Gyro experimental work carried out at Slough, there is an Admiralty Gyro Research Laboratory at Greenwich, which is in charge of an Advisory Expert, who is paid the large salary of  3,000 per annum. We appreciate the varied scope of application of the Gyroscope, also the highly-specialised nature of this research work, and we feel that special individual agreements may have been necessary during the war, but in view of the salaries paid for other branches of research, we are of opinion that this arrangement should be terminated as soon as possible, and that the Gyro Laboratory at Greenwich be closed and the Director of Scientific Research be instructed to deal with this work either in his Central Research Laboratory or in the Compass Department at Slough.
Director of Naval Construction.92. In the Department of the Director of Naval Construction the numbers, of the staff were : 1913/14. 1922/23.170 235The increase in staff here is due to a concentration on new designs which have not in all cases materialised in new construction. The Director of Naval Construction submits that new designs of submarines, aircraft carriers, minelayers, and new capital ships under the limitation prescribed by Washington Conference represents at least as much work as was carried out in pre-war days. The increase in the Naval staff imposes more work on the Director of Naval Construction, in regard to furnishing sketch plans and other information. About three-quarters of,the work done in the Department relates to alterations and additions to existing ships. We have no suggestions to offer.93. So far as our enquiry has proceeded, we have been impressed by the size and cost of the staffs employed on the design, production and inspection of materiel and by the expenditure incurred in connection with applied research and experiment as a whole, and particularly in regard to ordnance, ammunition and explosives. We propose in our report on the War Office to deal generally with these subjects.Department oe the Fourth Sea Lord.94. The Fourth Sea Lord is responsible for the Supply and Transport Services of the Fleet.tie superintends the Naval Store, Fleet Coaling, Medical Store and Victualling. Services.In paragraph 98 of this Report we recommend that the office of Civil Lord be abolished and that the Fourth Sea Lord should superintend the Department of the Civil Engineer-in-Chief.Director of Stores.95. The staff of the Director of Stores was 84 in 1913/14 and 180 in 1922/23. The explanations for the increased staff in this Department are the increased complexity of stores and the addition of new types of war weapons, and the instruments and stores connected with them. The introduction of oil fuel has thrown additional work upon the Director of Stores, while the reduction in the quantity of coal handled has not substantially affected the size of the staff. Fleet auxiliary vessels are new, and their management involves additional staff. Motor transport has increased, and the new redistribution of the Fleet has involved additional work. The.Director of Stores indicated that complexity of stores rather than the quantity handled governs the size of his staff, and he indicated as the best comparison that the number of ledger headings had risen from 33,450 to 76,165 since the war. We have no detailed observations to make in regard to this Department, but we suggest that savings can only be made by a review of policy in regard to the size of the reserves maintained, and by a close examination of the whole process of Naval store-keeping. Care should be taken to ensure that the Naval Store-Department does not trench upon the functions of the professional branches.Director, of Victualling.96. The comparative statement of the staff of the Victualling Department is : 1913/14.    1922/23. Numbers at Headquarters     ... ... 40 58Staff in Victualling Yards     ...        ... 136 179     .The increases in this Department and in the Victualling Yards are due to the improved but more complicated arrangements ,f or - the messing of seamen, and to the improved accommodation and greater comfort brought about by the activities of the Fleet Welfare Committees. At the Naval Barracks and Training Estahlish-ments the system of general messes has been established and efforts are being made to introduce that system&apos;on board ship. It is believed that if the system is successful savings will be made in the authorised overhead rate for messing. The new item of free maintenance of kit involves more work and more complicated account keeping. In the, Victualling Yards the reduced hours of labour increase the [9277] e
number of men required, while the output per man is lower than in 1914, and a certain number of partially disabled men are now employed.   We have no suggestions to Offer.fm.it :&apos;.m&apos; :       u:.c:     il v.--) .     ?.ir -:-&apos;W:&apos; wv:   &quot; U    v/-,i r;;v&apos;l.     i;Department of the Civil Lord.97. The Civil Lord is responsible for works and buildings, including the purchase of lands. He superintends the Department of the Civil Engineer-in-Chief and deals with general labour questions.98. In the absence of insuperable constitutional or parliamentary objections, we recommend that the office of Civil Lord be abolished, and the duties now per-f ormed by him be connected with works and building sites and the Department of the Civil Engineer-in-Chief be transfered to the Fourth.Sea Lord. The Secretary should assume responsibility for his remaining duties.Department of the Civil Engineer-in-Chief.99. The Staff of this Department numbered 130 in 1913/14 and 151 in 1922/23.The main reason given for the increase of staff over the pre-war numbers, in spite of the reduced capital expenditure, was that the number of stations in charge of the Department has increased from nineteen in 1913 to twenty-nine in 1922. The change from coal to oil fuel has necessitated the construction of a number of new fuelling stations. It is unlikely that expenditure on capital Naval works in the future will be so great as it was in the period immediately preceding the war.We recommend that the staffs at dockyards and out-stations should be kept constantly under review with a view to the reduction of their numbers and grading so far as the exigencies of the service may permit.Department of Parliamentary and Financial Secretary.100. The Parliamentary and Financial Secretary is responsible for finance, estimates, expenditure and accounts, and proposals for new and, unusual expenditure generally. We make no recommendation.Department of the Permanent Secretary.101. The Permanent Secretary is responsible for the general organisation of the Admiralty Office, for the discipline of the clerical staff, for correspondence, and for Admiralty procedure and for financial control of expenditure.102. The staff of the Admiralty Office is composed of Naval Officers, expert in the specialised functions for&apos; which they have been&apos; trained, and of civil servants expert in organisation and administration: The secretariat in particular, which acts as a general service department for the Admiralty as a whole, has the duty of subjecting all schemes, plans and proposals involving expenditure to financial scrutiny. !&apos; ;    -1 As a majority of naval officers serve only two years at the Admiralty, and have therefore limited opportunities of gaining experience of Admiralty administration, the permanent staff of civil servants exercise a powerful influence on policy and serve to ensure continuity of system. They constitute the permanent executive machine.In 1913/14 the numbers employed were 116, while the numbers employed to-day, including temporary staff, are 372. The work to be done and the staff required is therefore definitely related to the activities of the other Departments. If, for example, the Naval Staff have increased, so also has the military branch of the secretariat. Apart from the main generalisations - contained in our preliminary remarks,;there are certain special explanations for the-increased staff.. The Secretary ^Department has recently taken over, a substantial part of the registry work from other Departments. It controls the new central pool of typists and process.workers.  These items alone account for an increase.of 120 persons.&apos;*!&quot;, A new section with a staff of seven has been created to prepare and issue Fleet orders. -JBeforethe war Admiralty instructions were conveyed,by letter to Admirals in command of1 Fleets and Squadrons, who utilised their secretarial staff for duplicating and circulating these instructions to the ships.
Another example of increase is the present provision of fourteen shorthand typists for the use of the members of the Board of Admiralty and their assistants as compared with five in pre-war days. Apparently, memoranda and letters in pre-war days were written by the Sea Lords themselves or by their private secretaries.These are typical examples of oases where a change has been made which on paper should have resulted in economy.. We have come across a number of such cases, and, while we appreciate the difficulty of definitely establishing and measuring the consequent economies, yet we are bound to point out that we cannot find evidence of their realisation. Like most of the other civil Departments, that of the Secretary is legitimately temporarily increased in staff to meet the extra work involved in the reduction of the Navy and the treatment of war aftermath problems. The Secretary has stated that he anticipates the need of a staff of 350 during the next financial year, but we trust that still further reductions may be found possible.The organisation: of the Department of the Secretary in 1914 and to-day is shown in Appendix TV.103. A change of fundamental importance has been made recently in the duties of the Permanent Secretary. In 1914 the Accountant-General was: responsible to the-Parliamentary and Financial Secretary for financial control and expenditure. It was decided by the Cabinet in 1920 that this responsibility shall be vested in the Secretary, who is now a member of the Board of Admiralty. This change has involved a more expensive organisation in the Secretary&apos;s staff, particularly in the higher gradings. The Deputy-Secretary and one new Assistant-Secretary are new appointments created largely on account of this new financial responsibility. We have failed to find any reduction resulting from this change in the department of the Accountant-Ceneral. The Accountant^Genera] stated that he himself is now relieved of the responsibility for financial scrutiny of proposals, but that the change has not affected the work of his staff. We consider that this question requires close investigation and that the Permanent Secretary, in conjunction with the Accountant-General should take such steps with the Heads of sections as will ensure that the staff in these sections of the Accountant-Generals Department are definitely relieved of the function of financial criticism of new proposals involving expenditure. We recognise that changes like the foregoing, together with changes in policy involving reductions in the Navy may necessitate extra work during the transition stage, but we should expect a position of stability soon to be reached when substantial reductions should be made.Department of Dockyard Expense Accounts.104. The numbers and cost of the staff of this Department were as follows : 1913/14. 1922/23. Staff numbers at Headquarters       ...           21 40Cost i ......     ......        5,322  14,000*Staff numbers in Home Dockyards   ... 315 495Cost.  ......   ., -    .....  ...     ...       36,483  90,000*To the numbers of the staff in the Home Dockyards should be added 200 Recorders and their cost; &apos;The three objects for which both the Headquarters and outside staff exist are : (a.) The recording and collecting of wages, material costs and overhead charges incurred in the Dockyards and their embodiment in the Admiralty Blue Book, a public account prepared for presentation to Parliament in accordance.with Statute. . : .(&amp;.) A running survey and check of expenditure against the respective estimates.(c.) To a certain extent the preparation of detailed cost data of work carried out in the Dockyards to enable the various Technical Departments to see how their estimates have worked out and the cost of the work generally..1.05. In 1914 the number of operatives in the Home Dockyards was 42,459; now it is 37,999. The expense accounting staff was 315 in 1914; now it is 495. It has accordingly increased 57 per cent; to record and analyse the work of 11 per cent, fewer men.   The ratio of this cost keeping staff in the Dockyards to the total* Approximately.
operatives is 13 per cent. We have made certain enquiries in regard to private firms, and we find that in a large private shipbuilding and engineering establishment of a nature comparable to a Royal Dockyard, but with much less repair work, the ratio is 05 per cent. Although the number of separate contracts is less in the case of the private firm, the most detailed cost analysis of the work is carried out and ample data are provided to furnish the estimators and Heads of Departments with full and reliable data.106. We thoroughly realise the value of cost data and expenditure returns to enable Heads of Departments to check their estimates, to realise the financial effect of their work and to institute comparisons with similar work done under different-conditions and of similar work done in other Dockyards. We are not, however, by any means convinced that the existing system economically furnishes that information. In the recording of the hours spent by workmen on different jobs, for example, we find in existence the old system of men travelling round the yard booking the times. And, further, that these recorders are trained craftsmen paid as such. This system is out of date and unduly expensive.107. It is beyond the scope of this Committee to make detailed investigations and recommendations in regard to this matter, but we feel confident that by improved methods substantial savings could be made, and we recommend the Admiralty to reconstitute the existing Departmental Committee now sitting on this subject, adding to it men with wide experience of works cost accounting in private business, also someone with wide experience of works management, such as the Director-General Ordnance Factories. The terms of reference of the Committee should be revised to cover the whole question of Dockyard Expense Accounting, including the Head-quarters establishment at the Admiralty.Department of the Accountant-General.108. The numbers of the staff of the Accountant-General&apos;s Department were as follows: Total Staff, 1913/14 Estimates     ... ...        350Total Staff, 1922/23 Estimates     ... ...      1,100This Department, which is at present the largest in numbers of all the Admiralty Departments, is divided into three divisions : accountancy, claims and personnel. The duties of the accountancy division include the preparation of the annual estimates and other estimates of cost, and of the annual appropriation account. As the estimates are now prepared earlier in the year and policy has, owing to changes in the international situation, been subject to frequent review, these estimates have been revised to a much greater extent than in the past, thus involving considerably more work. In the accountancy division is included the staff charged with cost investigation. In pre-war days the costs investigation branch was unimportant and had a staff of three or four. During the war its importance greatly increased, and since the war a large staff has been maintained in order to clear up war work. The present staff engaged on this work number seventy-nine. Of those, about thirty are still engaged on war aftermath work, and we are informed they will be so engaged until about September 1923. We recommend that this work should be subjected to close scrutiny with the object of accelerating its completion.109. War conditions and war-time contracts no doubt necessitated the mainten-ance of a capable and efficient cost investigation staff, the placing of contracts for experimental work on a cost basis will in future be greater than in 1914, and it is desirable that the Director of Contracts should be able to command cost data and cost estimates to enable him to check prices. He has now a staff engaged on this work. All such cost estimating and cost investigation work has three professional aspects, those&apos; of the Accountant, the Cost Accountant and the Technician. We are convinced that the Admiralty do not require &quot;two independent cost accounting branches, one under the Director of Contracts and one under the Accountant-General.The Cost Investigation Department also appear to be doing work which is not properly within their province. For example, they are dealing with accounting for certain wireless services and they are setting up cost systems in the armament supply depots. The first is not work for highly trained cost accountants, but rather for ordinary accounting clerks.   This work should be transferred to a suitable
29insection of the Accountant-General&apos;s Department. The setting up of cost systems is a matter for the Director of Expense Accounts and is out of place in the Cost Investi-gatioii section. &apos;   &quot;      &apos;110. We recommend that the Cost Investigation section under the Accountant-General and the Cost Estimating section of the Director of&apos; Contracts be1 abolished and a small combined cost estimating and investigation section should be created; which should be under the Director of Contracts.111. In the personnel division 280 men are employed on the aftermath duty of dealing with prize money and medals, which accounts for a substantial proportion of the increased numbers. The grant of marriage allowances is new since 1914, and the numbers employed on this are 156, against 41 employed before the war on voluntary allotment. The branch dealing with records and ratings now employs 89 instead of 71, due to increased correspondence and formulation of new requests. Retired pay, gratuities and pensions also represent additional work on this Department. New policy and fresh legislation have imposed many new duties on the Department. The following may be cited as examples : Commutation of Pensions, Pensions Increase Act; Injuries in War Compensation Act; Unem-ployment Pay to Officers; Representation of the People Act; Merchant Shipping Salvage Act.112. Our attention has been drawn to the possible overlapping between the finance sections attached to the professional Departments of the Claims Branches of the Accountant-General&apos;s Department, and we are gratified to find that a Departmental Committee is now investigating this matter. Another possible overlap occurs between, the Director of Contracts and the Accountant-General in regard to the settlement of contractors&apos; claims, and we suggest that the Departmental Committee might well consider whether the Accountant-Genera].&apos;s Department in regard to payments of claims could not more usefully be regarded as a Cashier Department than as a Finance Department,, which implies a wider-scope of activity than Is perhaps required. This Committee should aim at the abolition of duplicate records in the Technical Departments and in the Accountant-General&apos;s Department in connection with statements of liability and expenditure and contracts and claims.Director of Navy Contracts.113. The numbers of the staff of the Director of Navy Contracts were Apart from the general causes for increases of staff the new Costs Estimating Section employs seven men and carries out work for other Government Departments. For our recommendations with regard to this section see paragraph 110 of this report. Although the money involved in the contracts at present is much less than in 1914, the Director of Contracts states that he requires a larger staff as the nature of contracts entered into has become more complex,&apos; and the number of separate contracts has not greatly diminished. The administration of the King&apos;sRoll condition increases the work and also negotiations with&apos; the Ministry of Labour in regard to the allocation of contracts to areas where unemployment is acute. Ten men are now employed on disposals work, which is much more complicated than in 1914; Six men are still engaged in war liquidation work.We suggest that consideration be given to the possibility of reducing the number of engineer officers employed on inspection duties under coal contracts by using the services of engineer officers from the1 new area offices recently created by the Engineer-in-Chief.Whitley Councils.114. Our attention has been called to the amount of work involved in the Whitley Councils, and it has been represented to us that it constituted an important factor in leading to increased staff. We asked the Departments to furnish us with estimates of the man-hours definitely devoted to this work. From the figures furnished it would appear that the work&apos; involved in&apos; Whitley Councils represents the labour of at least tweiity-fbur persons continuously employed for the Admiralty Office, War Office and Air: Ministry. We would point out that the work involved in the Whitley CouncilsStaff in 1913/14 Staff in 1922/2395 227[9277]F
is not entirely additional work, for it must in some measure take the place of the old arrangements for dealing with questions of pay and conditions of employment.Office Accommodation.115. We consider that it may be useful to refer to a matter which has a definite influence on economy of staff. The Admiralty, like most Government offices, built some years ago, consists to a great extent of small rooms, with the result that the staff is widely dispersed. Experience in civil life during the last few years-has shown the great value of large rooms containing blocks of staff with a minimum of what might be called private rooms. We feel that this should be borne in mind in any new Government office schemes, and, in the meantime, the Office of Works should, be asked to report as to the extent to which partitions - could be removed in existing Government offices with a view to the creation of rooms containing larger working units of staff, thereby ensuring better light and ventilation, and enabling closer supervision to be exercised.SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS. General.1. The pay of the Fighting Services and the pay of the Civil Service should be closely reviewed in relation to the scales of remuneration of the rest of the nation by a strong and authoritative Commmitee appointed by the Cabinet. (Paragraph 12.)2. The conditions in Government Departments as regards working hours, overtime and holiday leave should be reviewed at the same time and by the same body that is set up to deal with pay and remuneration.  (Paragraph 14.)3. (a.) In view of the difference in the degree of responsibility of Directors, these appointments should be graded, and a definite salary should be assigned to each appointment.   (Paragraph 36.)(b.) Before Naval Officers on the active list are appointed to posts at the Admiralty, the duties of which could be discharged with equal efficiency by civilian agency, consideration should be given to the possibility of appointing a retired Naval Officer or a civilian.  (Paragraph 39.)4. The appointments of officers on the active list to the Admiralty and technical establishments should in future be for periods of not less than three years. (Para-graph 39.)5. Economies should be effected by the more extended employment at the Admiralty of officers below the rank of Commander.  (Paragraph 40.)Board of Admiralty.6. (a.) The Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff should cease to be a member of the Board of Admiralty.  (Paragraph 46.)(&amp;.) The appointment of Civil Lord of the Admiralty should be abolished, and the duties now discharged by the Civil Lord should be transferred to the Fourth Sea Lord and Secretary.   (Paragraphs 94 and 98.)Private Secretaries and Naval Assistants.7. (a.) The establishment of private secretaries to members of the Board of Admiralty and others should be reviewed in order to ensure that the cost is reduced and the establishment is brought more into line with practice in other Government Departments and in civil life.   (Paragraphs 41-43.)(&amp;.) The pre-war practice under which the appointments of Private Secretary to members of the Board were held by civil servants should be reverted to. (Paragraphs 41-43.)(c.) The number of Naval Assistants working by themselves without executive responsibility for particular Departments should be reduced.   (Paragraph 43.)Department of the Chief of the Naval Staff. 8. (a.)

(b.) The Local Defence Division should cease to exist and any essential staff functions now performed by it should be carried out by the Operations and Elan Divisions.   (Paragraph 47.)(c.) The Trade Division should cease to exist and the small and essential Naval; Staff functions now discharged by it should be transferred to the Plans Division. (Paragraph 48.)(d.) The Directorates of the Naval Staff should be reduced to four in number, viz., (1) Operations, (2) Plans, (3) Intelligence, and (4) Training and Staff Duties, and they should be under the direct control of the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff. (Paragraph 49.)(e) The Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff should have charge of Training and Staff Duties with the status of a Director.  (Paragraph 49.)Department of the Hydrographer.9. (a.) A definite programme of the hycfcographic work to be undertaken in a specified period should be laid down by the Admiralty.  (Paragraph 51.)(b.) The numbers of the officer establishment and the composition of the civilian staff of the Department should be closely reviewed in order to ensure that it is suitable for the prescribed programme of work.   (Paragraph 51.)(c.) The Hydrographic Department should be removed to more suitable and cheaper premises outside the Admiralty. The accommodation in the. Admiralty building thus set free should be allotted to Departments now outside the Admiralty which, from the point of view of administrative efficiency, it is desirable to locate in the main office, for example, the Contracts Department.   (Paragraph 52.)Department of the Second Sea Lord.10. We understand that a Committee is now sitting at the Admiralty to qonsider whether any changes should be made in the relative responsibilities of the Chief of the Naval Staff and the Second Sea Lord for the education and training of the fleet. We strongly urge that if any changes are made in existing arrange-ments, care should be taken to ensure that there is no duplication of work and that the full effect of the changes in regard to economies of staff are realised. (Paragraphs 55 and 56.)Royal Naval College, Greenwich.11. (a.) The appointment of Captain of the College should be abolished. (Paragraph 57.)(b.) The practice of using Naval Officers for professorial work should be given up where practicable.  (Paragraph 58.)(c.) The numbers and cost of the staff of the Naval War College should be reduced.  (Paragraph 58.)The Educational Staff of the Fleet.12. The policy in regard to Educational Staff of the Fleet should be reconsidered with the object of reducing cost.   (Paragraph 62.)Training Establishments.13. A more intensive use of these establishments should be made by reducing leave and the periods between courses.  (Paragraph 63.)Medical Department.14 (a.) The number of Medical Officers should be carefully watched and no increase should be permitted.  (Paragraph 65.)(b.) The Medical Establishment maintained at Greenwich for the manufacture of vaccines and drugs for the use of the Navy should be abolished and the Admiralty should, in future, obtain the vaccines, &amp;c, required for the Navy from the military establishment at Millbank.  (Paragraph 65.)Directorate of the Paymaster-Director-General.15-(a.) The office of Paymaster-Director-General should be abolished and the pre-war practice under which the work connected with the Paymasters Branch was carried out by an officer under the Second Sea Lord not above the rank of Paymaster-Captain should be reverted to.  (Paragraph 67.)[9277] G
(b.) The functions now performed by the Department of the Paymaster-Director-General in connection with messing arrangements of the fleet should be handed over to the Director of Victualling.  (Paragraph 67.)A admiral Commanding Coastguards and Reserves.16. This Directorate should be abolished and should become a section of the Mobilisation Directorate with a head of the rank of Captain, R.N.  (Paragraph 68.)Department oe the Third Sea Lord.17. (a.) A Deputy Controller should be appointed to relieve the Third Sea Lord.  (Paragraph 71.)(b.) The Directorate of Naval Equipment should be abolished and its essential functions should be discharged by the Deputy Controller with two or three assistants.  (Paragraph 71.)Directorate of Naval Ordnance. Directorate of Torpedoes and Mining. Directorate of A rearmament Supply. Directorate of Signals.18. (a.) The Department of Armament Supply should cease to exist as a separate Directorate and should become a section of the Directorate of Naval Ordnance.   (Paragraph 75.)(&amp;.) The Armament Supply Section should be confined to the duties of holding and issuing stores, the title of its head being changed to &apos;&apos; Superintendent of Ordnance Stores.&quot; (Paragraph 75.)(c.) The function of scrutiny of design from the point of view of production should no longer be discharged by special officers in any department; but should be exercised in the course of their ordinary duties by the Inspection and Design Staffs of the Director of Naval Ordnance.  (Paragraph 75.)(d.) In view of the transfer to the Director of Naval Ordnance of the technical duties hitherto performed by the Director of Armament Supply, the post of Superintendent of Ordnance Stores might be held by a civilian.   (Paragraph 75.)(e.) In view of the heavy expenditure incurred on the repair and reconditioning of ammunition and stores, the Admiralty should review their policy in regard to the size and nature of the stocks to be held with a view to their reduction. (Paragraph 76.)(/.) The repair and cleaning of small arm ammunition should be discontinued in all Admiralty establishments and concentrated at whatever military establishment is engaged on similar work for the Army.  (Paragraph 76.)(g.) Concurrently with the introduction of new types of weapons and ammunition, every effort should be made to accelerate the elimination of obsolescent types.  (Paragraph 76.)(A.) The Signal Department should cease to be a separate Directorate and should become a section of the Directorate of Torpedoes and Mines.   (Paragraph 77.)Department of Director of Dockyards and the Royal Dockyards.19. (a.) The Admiralty should appoint a Committee, which should include 1 outside engineers and shipbuilders, to make a full investigation of Dockyard organisation and personnel with a view to improving administration and effecting economies.  (Paragraph 83.)(b.) Instructions should be given to complete at the most economical rate the light cruisers and destroyers which were taken from the contractors to the Dockyards in an incomplete state.   (Paragraph 81.)(c.) If there is no new work to take the place of these vessels on their completion, the establishment of the Dockyards should be reduced.   (Paragraph 81.)(d.) We endorse the view of the Geddes Committee that Pembroke Dockyard be closed doAvn and that the services of the 1,200 men now employed there be dispensed with.  (Paragraph 85.)(e.) Sheerness Dockyard should similarly be closed down.   (Paragraph 85.)(/.) The establishment at Chatham Dockyard should be reduced by using it only for the repair of vessels for which its docking accommodation is essential. (Paragraph 85.)
(g.) The policy in regard to the number of ancillary craft held in reserve should be carefully reconsidered, especially in regard to mine-sweepers and small boats. (Paragraph 86.)(h.) The Dockyard craft should also be subjected to a close scrutiny with a view to the reduction of their numbers.  (Paragraph 86.)Department of Scientific Research.20. (a.) A definite sum should be allotted to scientific research in the annual Estimates.  (Paragraph 89.)(b.) In future Estimates details of the expenditure on Scientific Research should be furnished showing how the funds available are applied.  (Paragraph 89.)Compass Department.21. Arrangements should be made for this Department to carry out all compass work for the three Fighting Services.  (Paragraph^90.)Gyro Research Department.22. (a.) The Gyro Laboratory at Greenwich should be closed and the Director of Scientific Research should be instructed to deal with this work either in the Central Research Laboratory or in the Compass Department at Slough.

The Accountant-GeneraFs staff should be definitely relieved of the function of financial criticism of new proposals involving expenditure.  (Paragraph 103.)Department of Dockyard Expense Accounts.28. The Departmental Committee now sitting on the Department of Dockyard Expense Account should be reconstituted and its Terms of Reference should be widened to cover the whole question of Dockyard Expense Accounting, including the Headquarters establishment at the Admiralty.   (Paragraph 107.)[9277] &apos; g 2
Department of the Accountant-General.29. (a.) The Cost Investigation Section under the Accountant-General and the Cost Estimating Section of the Director of Contracts should be abolished and a small combined Cost Estimating and Investigation Section should be created and placed under the Director of Contracts.  (Paragraph 110.)(6.) The accounting for certain wireless services should be transferred to a suitable section of the Accountant-GeneraPs Department.  (Paragraph 109.)(c.) The setting up of cost systems is a matter for the Director of Expense Accounts and should not be undertaken by the Cost Investigation Section. (Paragraph 109.)(d.)
