THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPEHTEOF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEELEENT. ,-CP. 210  (85). &apos; . *\*0 A B I H E T. PROPOSED OOELEROIAL TREATY WITH BRAZIL. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.for many years past Brazil has been in the habit of giving a preference to goods of the United States which she has refused to extend to this or any other country.   We have no Treaty Y/ith Brazil giving us most favoured nation treatment and it has there-fore not been possible to claim as a Treaty right the benefit of the preference given to the United States.   This was undoubtedly part of a tendency known as &quot;Pan-Americanism&quot; and fostered by the United States of America, the underlying idea being that the various republics of America ought to be&apos;able to give one another favours which they did not have to extend ,by virtue of most favoured nation clauses and treaties to any European countries.   We found great difficulty in combating this tendency.On the occasion of the visit of the King of the Belgians to Brazil after&apos;the war, Brazil extended to Belgium the preference which she had previously given only to the United States, and all our efforts to secure a similar extension to this oountry proved abortive.Recently the Brazilian Government have become more friendly to this country, partly as a result of the part played by us in their Centenary Exhibition   and Celebrations, and the position now is that in the new budget law of this year the preference both to the United States and Belgium is revoked, but the Brazilian Government have the right to give special favours to any country making concessions to Brazil.   No doubt these preferences or the chief of them will in consequence be restored: but the Brazilians have led us to understand that if we could give them some concession as an excuse for departing from their previous policy they would be prepared to extend the preferencesto us.SECRET.
As our exports to Brazil are considerable now and haveundoubted potentialities and such Important goods as rubbermanufactures, colours and inks, varnishes, weighing machines and cement among others were the subject of preference, Ithink it important that the matter should be at once taken up.The discrimination In favour of the United States, and latterlyBelgium, had been a rankling source of disoontant with our commercial community, and I am very much afraid that thesystem of giving preference to the United States may spreadamong South American countries If this discrimination continues.With Treasury consent I have suggested that we should enter into an agreement with Brazil giving us most favoured nation treatment in return for our giving similar treatment to Brazilian goods on importation Into this country and alsoguaranteeing freedom of duty for the period of the agreement(two or three years with continuance subject to ,six months&apos;notice) to the following articles of Brazilian production:-Brazil nuts,Lard,Meat,Raw cotton, Hides,Raw rubber, and Cotton seed oil.Sir John Tilley our Ambassador in Rio has in the last fewdays emphasised the necessity of our acting at once If we areto succeed.As the Colonial Office feels some doubt, about the pro-posal in view of the forthcoming   Imperial Economic Conference, on their suggestion I am addressing this memorandum to the   ... Cabinet.   But I cannot conceive that it is at all likely that we should find it desirable or possible,, in the next few years at any rate, to impose an import duty on any of these articles.   It is feared, I believe, that Brazil might perhaps
&quot;... 74subsidise the export of neat, to the detriment of Dominion exporters to the United Kingdom but to meet this we&apos;might insert in the treaty a provision which occurs in many oom-meroial treaties, to the following effect:-&quot;The only exception to the above provision shall be in the case of the sanitary or other prohibitions occasioned by the necessity of securing the safety of persons or of cattle or of plants useful to agriculture and of the measures applicable in either of the two countries to articles enjoying a direct or indirect bounty in the other&quot;.I should, however, feel indisposed to include this clause in&apos; the provisional exchange of notes as insistence on qualifi-indications at that stage by us would lead to the proposal of qualifications by the Brazilians.     This would oause delay and might result in our having to go into all the details of the treaty before we got any advantage.     The negotiation of a treaty cannot be hurried and it is important, in view, of the state of trade, that British goods should be allowed to compete on equal terms at once.(Intld.)
