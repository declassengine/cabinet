BIB DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENT.CABINET, I trade BOARDS BILL. - SLOW WORKERS. MEMORANDUM   BY   THE   MINISTER   OP   LABOUR.,521 1.     The Home Affairs Committee at their meeting on 17thApril decided to refer the question of the exemption of &quot;slow11 (S3)      workers to the Cabinet for decision.     The Trade Boards bill provides, as do the existing Acts, for the fixing of statutory Minimum Rates of Wages in trades to which it le applied.   In order to avoid hardship, the existing Acts and the Bill permit a Trade Board to grant a Permit for a rate to be paid lower than the statutory minimum in the case of persons who are incapable, by reason of infirmity or physical injury, of earning the statutory rate.2.   , Lord Dave&apos;a   Committee of Enquiry recommended that the Trade Board&apos;s power of exemption should be extended to cover any worker who from old age or any other cause is incapable of earning the minimum rate applicable to him.   This recommendation was made in order to avoid the possibility that &quot;slow&quot; workers who oannot earn the minimum rate fixed for the ordinary worker of their class should not for that reason lose employment.   In the Draft Bill the ground of old age has been added to those of infirmity and physical injury but the words used will not enable a Trade Board to issue a permit solely on the ground that a worker who is neither infirm, disabled nor old is slow. 5.     I would press that the suggested extension of the Permit arrangement to the &quot;slow&quot; worker as such should not be made, A Trade Board can issue a Permit of Exemption only in the light of the facts of each case in which a Permit is desired. These faots cannot be accepted from the statement made in the application which the worker and hie employer make.   It is necessary for a member of the Trade Board (or in oertain cases/an
an Official of the Ministry of Labour) to viBit the worker and verify the statements which have been made.   The work of such verification in relation to permits under the existing Acts is difficult to perform although the number of applieatione whioh have to be dealt with is comparatively small.   Serious delay in the consideration of applications is often inevitable because it is not possible to arrange for the necessary visit to be paid to the worker and his employer.   It is feared that an extension of the Permit system to include the &quot;slow&quot; worker as such would increase the number of applications to an extent which, even with the assistance of local Committees, would prevent any proper examination of individual oases being made.   Glearly employers anxious to under-cut their competitors might be disposed to believe that a substantial proportion of the workers in their employment were &quot;slow&quot; workers within the meaning of the Aot. Any large rush of applications, however caused, would undoubtedly have one of two results:-(a) It would prove impossible within a reasonable period to examine the applications, and employers would feel that in the absence of a decision by the Trade Board they were entitled to aot as if their applications had been granted. In this case the whole administration of the Acts would be seriously threatened?   or(b) If by the appointment of a number of special Investigating Officers the applications were prepared within a reasonable period for consideration by the Trade Board, the Board would become alarmed at the threat to the minimum rate which they had fixed and would refuse to grant Permits is. practically all cases excepting those which are cohered by the provisions of the existing Acts. In this event addition-al expenditure would be thrown upon the State without any appreciable result.
4.    It is not, perhaps, generally appreoiated that the &quot;b1ow* worker is not prejudiced at all 88 oompared with other workers when he is employed upon piece work. Some 70$ of all the workers affeoted by rates under the Trade Boards act are so employed.    With regard to &quot;slow&quot; workers employed at time rates, the restriction imposed by the new Bill on the rate-fixing powers of Trade Boards will in any oase make their position a&amp;aier than it has been under the existing Aota,    It 1b probable that the compulsory rates fixed by the Boards will only tie striotly appropriate to the minority of workers In moat trades.    Accordingly, there will always be a margin for the bulk of the workero who will be employed at ratee above the minimum. 5.    I would add that as the Cabinet are aware the Bill whloh they have genorally approved follows throughout the lines of the Cave Report with one departure.    This departure relates to the method of recovery In respect of &quot;Bn rates.    The Cave Report recommended that in addition to the worker&apos;s contractual right the Minister of Labour should be empowered to sue on hie behalf. This additional powor of tho Minister has not been inserted in the Bill.    To that extent, therefore, tho oonoeeeion ie in favour of the employers.    It will bo strongly resisted by the workers who regard thio point as a fundamental one in the bargain upon whioh tho Report w&amp;b baBed.     the resistance would, however, perhaps be modified to some extent if a concession in reepect of &quot;slow&quot; workers on the linec I have recommended is made,/6.
6.     The Bill has, subject to the above, been finally-approved by the Home Affairs Committee.I desire to ask the Cabinet to approve the Bill (subject to the above point) with a view to introducing it immediately before Whitsuntide.(Intld-.)
