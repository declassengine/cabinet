23)THIS DOCUMENT IS THE. PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S KTBfflniW *o ab ini. . j the   SOOPE   .OE   THE   STANDING   JOINT   COMMITTEE   IOR EX&quot;SERVICE   QUESTIONS.C o kMEMORANDUM  BY   THE   MINISTER   03?   LABOUR.   - -      d d   . .1. The question of the Boope of the Standing Joint Ooramitteofor ex-Servioe Questions has again been raised, the British Legion having addressed to the prime Minister a further letter on the subjoot (oopy attached - appendix a).   In this letter they again press that the Standing Committee shall disous3 questions ooncerning post-war ex-Servica men. 2, On the 22nd fobruary last 1 circulated a Memorandum(CP.124 (23)) to the Cabinet, on the subject of the scope of the Standing Joint Committee, in whioh it was stated that I proposed to open negotiations with the British Legion for tho continuance of the work of the Committee on a compromise basis, namely, that the Committee should continue to function, as it does at present, for a further period of twelve months, without prejudice to the terms of reference being reconsidered then.The precise terms of the compromise arrangement are as follows&quot;It is dear that a question raised in connection with&apos; an ex-soldier may frequently have application to an ex-soldier of the Sreat War as well as to a post-war soldier, although tho question may happen to arise first on a post-war oaso.     It has accordingly been proposed and agreed to by all Government Departments ooncerned that   questions of such a character may be raised and replied to by the representatives of the Departments, including the war Offioe, without speoify-ing whether they arise in the first instance on a Great &apos;far or a post-war oase0     If in the course of the. discussion it becomes clear that the case in question is a post-war ono, ordinarily the discussion will not bo pursued unless or until it appears that some Groat 77ar case is, or may be, also involved&quot;.I duly put to the Legion the proposal to continue thiscompromise arrangement for a further 12 months.     The Legion
representatives on the Standing Committee have intimated that they cannot accept the proposal;   there la not, up to the present, any corresponding refusal from the Executive Council of the Legion, which la the proper authority to express a decision;   that Council instead, has taken the line of urging the Prims Minister to give way on the general question,3. I need not a^ain go over the points that are raiBedhy the claim of the Legion; the views of the Service Departments and those of the Minister of Pensions and myself are well known to our colleagues.   The question now to foe decided is what line is to be taken in reply to the latest communication from the Legion.4. We appear to have reached the point at which we must decide either (a) to adhere to the compromise offer - a pour-se which may conceivably mean a break with the Legion, though, of course, it must be remembered that they will not willingly give up the Standing Committee; or (b) to adopt the view of the Legion that the Standing Committee should deal with post-war ex-Service questions -a course to whioh I understand the Secretary of State for 7lar objects, and whioh, in any event, would mean alterations in the composition of the Standing Committee. A third alternative would be to Inform the Legion that, although the Government cannot admit that the Standing Committee is competent to deal with post-war ex-service questions in general, we are prepared to consider any reasonable modification of the compromise arrangement set out in paragraph H, providing that the arrangement is still on a temporary basis.   (I have in mind that perhaps the Legion might see their way to surest some practicable compromise for say the next three or four years).
dd iAs to the first alternative, my own viow is that it would bo   inexpedient at this stage openly to break with the Legion, more especially as the question Involved is not one really of great substance; that is to say, the majority of the questions raised are in fact Groat War ex-Service questions, or are in gome way linked up with the Great fiar questions.As to the second alternative, I fully realise the force of the views of the Service Departments, and naturally I should be reluctant to press the matter unduly,   I suggest, therefore, that It might be worth while to explore the third alternative. Perhaps aa a first step the Cabinet would agree to appoint a small Sub-Committee consisting say of Representatives of the Service Departments, Ministry of Pensions and Ministry of Labour who should consider whether any modification of the existing compromise is possible? and who should if thought desirable confer with representatives of tho Legion accordingly.(Intd). M.B.ministry of Labour, June 19th, 1923.
St.Hon.Stanley Baldwin,10, Downing Street,s,7,1,1st June, 1923.Dear Sir,I am Instructed by the national   Bxeoutivo Council of the British Legion to aoinaunioato with you with regard to the present unsatisfactory position that exists as to the status of tho Standing Joint Committee on Qx-Sorvioo men&apos;s questions.I have no doubt that-you aro informed as to the history of this Committee and that it was established for the purpose of discussing as between representatives of Government Departments Interested in ex-Service men&apos;s questions and. representatives of ex-Service men&apos;s Organisations, various matters of mutual interest whioh from timo to time arise.     The position has now baun reached where a oertain Government Department refuses to continue to discuss questions whioh in tho opinion of the British Legion and the Committoe is oompotont to disouss.The main Panel of the Committee for some considerable periodhas had as an item on its Agenda &quot;The Scope of the Committee&quot;this my Council contend^is not the point at issue.     The questionis as to tho interpretation of the Constitution of tho Committeewhioh Constitution was agreed upon by Mr. Lloyd George when hewas Prime Minister and -which he was instrumental in himselfestablishing.     The Constitution of the committee  under paragraph(l) states that tho said Committee is sstablishod.fa)   To assist organisations of ex-Officers and ex-Service men in their task of securing to their members and to. ex-Sorvioo men of H.K.Foroas generally, full informa-tion as to tho rights and privileges conferred upon them by the Crown and Barliamunt and the enjoyment of such rights and privileges.(b)   To provide machinery for consultation between theGovernment and ex-members of H.M.Forces upon questions affooting, ex-Service officers and men and thoir dependants.COPY. AEB3HDII   A.
One Department at present rufuses to disouss questions whioh in their opinion oonoeras post-war ex-service  men.   as you are probably aware the Legion accepts to ordinary momber-ship any ax-servioe man or woman whatever period they may have served in H.M,Poroos, and in view/of the fact that paragraph (a) mentioned above refers quite infinitely to our members and not to any particular class of ox-Servlee men it is claimed by the Legion that we have a right under the present Constitution to raise any questions which affect tho Interests of the members of the Legion.The question, therefore, appears to the Council of the Legion to revolve not upon tho scope of the Committeo but upon the question as to whether or not tho representatives of the Government Department ooncorned are prepared to honour tho Constitution which thoy equally agreed to with representatives of tho Organisations that then existed and whioh have now been merged into the British Legion.Tho-national Exeoutive Counoil of the British Legion are most anxious to have this question definitely decided at tho earliest possible moment and 1 shall be most grateful if your decision ono way or the other oould be communicated to them in.time for tha next meeting of the Main panel of the Committee.In view of the fact that my Council are of opinion that the matter is one entirely for the interpretation of Clause (a) they are agreeable to the question as to its legal interpretation being placed before two independent Lawyers.I would in regard to the question as to whether-the Constitution meets with the view of these who framed it in the first instance, draw your attention to the fact that under Item 13 of the Constitution, there is provision mado for amendments&apos; to it and that if the Government Department/concerned
concerned is not prepared to abide by what the Constitution says, there is a channel provided whereby an amendment can be tabled.I am instructed by my national Executive council to again reiterate the undertaking already given by the Legion that they In no way desire to interfere with regulations whioh affect a man when he is actually serving.     The Legion recognises that the maintenance of discipline in the Serving Forces is of paramount importance.Yours faithfully,(Sgd)    J. Ra GBOEIU,Assistant Ssoretary.
