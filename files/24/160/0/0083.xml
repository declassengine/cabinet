tj^OOMHUHISTS - &apos;5Ehe Issue of the &quot;International Press Correspond ence&quot;for June 14th contains a particularly virulent articleby Losovaky on Anglo Russian relations, the main thema ofwhich is an attack upon the Secretary of state for foreignAffairs and &quot;the most predatory circles of Britishimperialists Y.ho are hacking him up&quot;:   in the course- ofthis article iosovsky states that:&quot;If England&apos;a demands with regard to the Bast are deciphered, it is seen that these not only imply that the Communist and Rod Tr&amp;fle Union International be banished from all places outside the frontiers of soviet Russia, but they aim at the conversion of Soviet Russia inso an imperialist power.   What does soviet Russia&apos;o propaganda consist of?   In the mere fact of its existence;   in the fact that it represents the realization of its conception of the right of self-determination of the -peoples. Compared with the mere fact of soviet Russia&apos;s existence, and soviet Russia&apos;g policy arising from the proletarian and socialist sources of our revolution, all Lord CuTBun&apos;!? stolen cipher telegrams are not worth a brass farthing.&quot;This is the kernel, of the whole matter.   The English bourgeoisie turns to the Russian revolution and bids it, through the mouth of its Grand Commander, to simply &quot;cease to be a socialist and Soviet republicI&apos;     We take the liberty of informing lord Cur son, decorated with all his various orders, that the Russian revolution does not permit an English slave-holder to stipulate tht lines on which it develops.   With regard to the locality of the Comintern and the Red International of Labour Unions, we have nothing against both Internationals removing to London, provided the English government guarantee us full liberty of agitation end propaganda.   In return for this we should undertake to fuarnish the English government with several oopies of all our publications, so that the English Minister for Eoroign affairs need not spend so much money in future in getting hold of these.   Should this arrangement not be acceptable to Lord Curaon, we can do no more than express our condolence at the exceeding sensitiveness of his Eastern colonial corns.&quot;While-Lord Curzon is spreading his nets on the Murman coast, he is aiming at more than a simple catch of fish;   while demanding one hundred and thirty thousand gold roubles, he and those behind him ere thinking of very different figures.   The appetite of these Murman fishermen may best be judged, from the appended declarations made by the not unknown Leslie Urquhart, who has never yet reconciled himself to the loss of his factories in the Ural...&quot;Only/
&quot;Only see bow simple the matter is I     It began with the fish and the thirteen thousand pounds sterling, and it ends with eight hundred million pounds sterling, or the round sum of eight milliard gold roubles....&quot;The same issue of this pt;per contains an artiale on &quot;The Baldwin Ministry&quot; by J.T. Walton ifewbold, in whioh the writer attaoks the Crown and the Ministry in a $fco&amp;Girt and offensive. Muses.The Communist Party of Great Britain, in uhe current iseu$ of the &quot;workers1 Weekly&quot; returned to the charge of &quot;British Agents&apos; activities against Russia&quot; and gave details of alleged support by British officials in Central Asia of groups opposed to Soviet Russia.The political Bureau has advised local groupB to dissolve the Councils of Action formed in connection with the Russian crisis, as they &quot;should be regarded as special instruments for special tasks, otherwise it will be found in practice that they become a burden instead of a weapon.&quot;The first session of the Enlarged Executive of the Communist International was held in the Red Hall of the Comintern on June 10th:   the delegates from Australia and South Africa had not then arrived.   It was decided to set up commissions of from 9 to 15 members to discuss the various items on the agenda, the sixth of which is &quot;the labour Movement in England&quot;.All the members of the Central Kxeeutive of the Communist Party, with the exception of George la aeon, have once more left for Moscow:   H. Inkpin is acting as organising secretary in the absence of his brother.        The delegates are given  50 when they reach Moscow, for their outward Journey and when they return receive the same amount for the Journey home.In the course of its oampaign to secure affiliation tothe/
&quot;*     v    &quot;*544the labour Party, the Communist Party has issued a leafletconsisting of questions and answers &quot;addressed to all workers affiliated to the labour party:&quot; IIos. 2 and 6 arenot without interest:&quot;Does the Coirmuuist Party accept the Constitution?&quot;question 2.     Can Communists accept the Constitution of &quot;Ihe&quot; Labo&quot;ur Party in the same sense that other affiliated bodies do?   Does the position differ in kind from that of the I.L.P., 3.D.P., or from any affiliated body that seeks to emond the labour Party Constitution?Answer. The Communist Party has always declaredTts readiness to accept the Labour Party Constitution, and does not ask for different treatment from any other affiliated body.   As with the Independent Labour Party, the social Democratic Federation, or any other body, the Communist Party expects to be subject to Executive administration in the operation of the Constitution. It will, if accepted as en affiliated body, seek to exercise the right of every constituent body to a federal organisation such as the Labour Party to amend that Constitution from time to time in accordance with its Party outlook.&quot;&quot;Parliamentary Democracy and Extra-aonstitutionalAotion.&quot;Question 6.     Does the Labour Party Constitution emphasise the fact that the object of that Party Is the achievement of  &quot;the political, social, and economic emancipation of the people by means of parliamentary Democracy&apos;?Answer. Ho.   This is not stated in the LabourParty Constitution.   The Constitution of that Party does include the. securing of political, social, and economic emancipation of the people, and more particularly of those who depend directly upon their own exertions by hand or brain for the means of life.&apos;     But- the Constitution does not delimit in any way the methods to be employed to this end.    Indeed, the Labour Party and its prominent leaders have at times subscribed to other methods, as, fox example, the &quot;Councils of Action.&apos; The Communist Party sets no limit upon the methods it advises should be used according to circumstances, from time to time, and this refusal to limit the methods to Parliamentary Democracy is hot an infringement of the Labour Party Constitution, and doee not of Itself constitute a bar to the affiliation of the Communist Party.&quot;The Communist Party has issued further draft resolutionsin support of the decisions of the recent Berlin conferenceof transport workers which are to be passed by branches ofthe Amalgamated Engineering Union as well as of the nationalUnion/

Once accepted you have to dispose of everything connecting you with the Communiet movement. .. &quot;The following is a sample of information required from agentsl/here food supplies are stored.

Reports are either to be handed in at Kings Street or to any official bearing the necessary credentials.&quot;The examination of Training Groups is now in full swing:   eight members of the Central London group have passod with first-class certificates, and this has given rise to a somewhat farcical position as this particular class was set up to train members of the   iixecutive:   no members of the Executive, however, attended and the successful candidates now state that by reason of this abstention from tho classes, the Executive is not competent to speak, conduct propaganda etc.     The examinations in the Thames Valley, whore the members are chiefly railwayman, have been completed, also the far Bast London branch examinations.THE/

In this respect particular stress should be laid to the problems of ths role of the nuclei in the arm and their leadership.   The plan set up by the illegal commission must neither be changed with regard to the principles nor to -the form.     The form of the military apparatus must remain as it was decided by the illegal commission.&quot;It is furthermore the task of the commission, to supplement the work of the first international conference of tha illegal Leagues by discussing the special forms of illegal work for anti-militarist activity.   In this respeot tho experiences made in the Ruhr district should be particularly considered..&quot;The nuclei in the army cannot be organised and work without a good internal organisational apparatus In the Leagues for anti-militarist work,     Therefore the commission must examine the conditions in the various countries in this respect and adopt decisions the realization of which will bring about an improvement of the anti-militarist departments where these are still deficient and an establishment of such departments where none exist.

The usual verbose dissertationsupon the &quot;situation of the youth&quot; form the greater part ofthis letter, the only passage of interest being that inwhich it islurged that there should be:&quot;Special agitation among the recruits and soldiers who are transport workers, above all among the occupation troops, furthermore support of the general anti-militarist work of the proletarian youth organisations inthe army.&quot;There does not seem to have been much improvement in the organisation of the Young Communist League of Great Britain: the Central Committee has passed a &quot;unanimous vote of the severest censure&quot; on Charles Redfern for failing to attend oommittee meetings, failing to attend the offices of t2ie league and failing to carry out &quot;important instructions of the International Executive Committee^which had been given him in Berlin and which he had promised faithfully to execute.&quot;INIBRMATIOIAL OE LABOUR UHIOHSAttempts to gain touch with British trade unions continue to be made by Russian sections of the Red International of Labour Unions:   this week the International Propaganda Committee of Textile Workers has informed aLancashire/
