(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS britannic MAJESTYS GOVERNMENT).SECRET. ,[CP. 207 (23).CABINET. COMMITTEE OH UNEMPLOYMENT, Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I append for the consideration of my colleagues the draft of a circular which Is proposed to he issued at an early date by the Unemployment Grants Committee.   The draft circular has been approved by the Cabinet Committee on Un-employment on the ground that it is necessary to contemplate a continuance of the system of grants in aid of relief works during the coming Winter.It is proposed, for the coming Winter, to introduce a new type of grant, namely, a grant in aid of works which, though ultimately revenue producing, will not Immediately or for some considerable time produce any appreciable revenue. The rate of grant proposed (50 per cent of Interest charges for a period not exceeding fifteen years) is more favourable than that allowed for works which will directly and Immediate! produce revenue and less favourable than that for works which will not produce revenue.The issue of the circular is an urgent matter since a considerable time is required to enable the local authorities to prepare schemes, and to enable the Unemployment Grants Committee to consider as a whole the schemes submitted to them!I shall accordingly be glad if my colleagues will authorise the issue of the proposed circular.P.L1.G.Board of Trade,24th April, 1923.
Sir,I am directed, by the Unemployment Grants Committee to refer to their Circular Letters of the 1st June and 7th December, 192P,, with regard to Schemes of work undertaken by Local Authorities with State assistance for the relief of unemployment during the winter 1922-23.In the abnormal circumstances of the last two winters it has been necessary to make considerable provision for unemployment.   The Government hope that the conditions which made this necessary will progressively disappear.   General unemployment has already improved and it is hoped with some confidence that this improvement will continue.   At the same time the industrial situation in r-ome districts next winter may warrant the execution of further public works for the relief of unemployment.   The Government accordingly wish to be in a. position to corisider making such provision for further assistance as the situation demands and the finances of the country admit.The Government will accordingly be obliged if Local . Authorities will again oo-operate with them by at once considering the prospects in their area, and by submitting to my Committee as soon as possible, and in any case not later than the end of July, a preliminary statement of works which could be put in hand if required.It will be appreciated that the extent to which Government assistance can be given must in any case be striotly limited, In view of the need of reducing the financial burden of the country.   Local Authorities should, therefore^ weigh carefully in each oase whether having regard to the prospects of improved employment any special scheme is needed in their area next winter.It/
It will not be necessary at this stage to submit       ^4 detailed drawings and plans.   Approximate estimates of expenditure, of numbers of men to be employed, and of duration of work, etc., on special forms to be obtained from this Committee will be sufficient.As regards the terms of assistance the Government would propose the following:-I. Works carried out from Capital and financed by Loan.(a) Revenue Producing Schemes.Grants equal to 50^ of the interest on loans raised by Local Authorities for a period of not less than 10 years, In respect of expenditure on approved schemes, will be paid by the State for a period of 5 years.(b) Schemes for work undertaken in connection with or as part of a revenue producing undertaking which, in the view of the competent department, will not themseIves directly produce revenue or&quot; are not likely to produce revenue for a oonsTao^abTe number of years.Grants equal to 50fo of the interest on loans raised for a period of not loss than 10 years in respect of expenditure on approved schemes will be repaid by the State for a period of 15 year3 or for the period of the loan, whichever is the less.(c) yon Revenue Producing Schemes.Grants equal to 6.5$ of the interest and sinking fund charges on loans raised to neet expenditure on approved schemes, will be paid by tho State for a period of one-half the term of the loan, subject to a maximum of 15 years.II. Works financed otherwise than by Loan.Grants will be paid by the State on the basis of 60$ of the wages bill of unemployed men taken on for the work.The general conditions previously laid down will continue to apply.   It will be optional for Local Authorities to carry out schemes by direct labour or through contractors, but the view of the Government is that the contract system should be adopted to the utmost possible extent.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,Secretary.
