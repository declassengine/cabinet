[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Mfrjestys Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1923.SECRET.CP. 292 (23).CABINET.SPECIAL REPORT ON  UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 95.    Period ended June 29, 1923.The number of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as wholly unemployed at the 25th June was 1,189,059, a decrease of 11,575 on the previous week.POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.COAL-MINING.&apos;Activity has continued in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Durham, the Midlands, and the Forest of Dean, but in the last-mentioned area there has been some indication of impending slackness. The Bristol coal-fields are fairly busy. Employment is steady in the Welsh coal-fields, and regular at most of the Scottish collieries.IRON AND STEEL.Employment has not been good in the Midlands, and the industry generally is unsettled. The situation in Scotland remains depressed, and no material improvement can probably be hoped for unless shipbuilding operations are extended. There has been a slight improvement in South Wales, and full-time continues to be worked in North Wales. Employment has declined on the North-East Coast, and the closing of some furnaces may be necessary.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.Employment at the yards on the South-West Coast has not been good. On the Mersey, there has been increased activity in repair work and reconditioning, but the continuance of the industrial dispute among the boilermakers has prevented new constructional work from being undertaken. The dispute continues to exercise an adverse effect generally upon this industry.ENGINEERING.This industry has become less active in the Home Counties. The gradual improvement in the South-Western Counties has, however, been maintained. Employment is steady in the motor and cycle section in the Midlands, but the outlook is uncertain; in general engineering the tendency towards improvement has continued. In Lancashire slackness continues in the textile section, and although general engineering is somewhat better, unemployment is still very heavy. The position in Scotland has remained depressed. There has been a general improvement in North Wales, and a slight improvement at most centres in South Wales. In Yorkshire and the North of England, the situation has slightly improved, but marine engineering continues to be adversely affected by the inactivity in shipbuilding.SUMMARY OF UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.
TEXTILES.Cotton. In Lancashire, there has been no improvement in the American spinning section. Most of the firms have been working half-time, Employment has been fairly good in the fine yarn section, but activity is not expected to continue. In the weaving section, a further decline has occurred. The dependent industries, viz., bleaching, dyeing and finishing, continue to be depressed. In Yorkshire, the depression continues.Hosiery, Woollen and Worsted. The hosiery trade in the Midlands has shown no sign of improvement, owing to the absence of the normal seasonal demand for summer goods. Short-time is being worked in the woollen and worsted industry in Scotland, and the immediate outlook is not bright. Unemployment has increased in the West Riding of Yorkshire. ;Lace. Apart from a slight improvement in the embroidery section, the depression in the Midlands shows no sign of lifting. In the South-Western Counties trade is fairly good at Exeter, but slackness continues at Chard.&apos; Silk. No improvement can be recorded in the Midlands except at Leek, where the weaving departments have been working overtime. At Macclesfield trade is moderate, and the outlook is poor.Jute. There is little change in the position, which remains rather unsettled.BUILDING.The activity in this industry has been maintained, and the demand for workmen, especially skilled operatives, continues.BOOT AND SHOE.In London and the Home Counties, a decline in output has been noticed. Slackness prevails in the South-Western Counties. The principal trade centre in the Midlands is very depressed, but in other areas prospects seem a little brighter.CLOTHING.There has been a decline in activity in the dressmaking and tailoring trades in London and the Home Counties. The Somerset glove trade is poor, and a decline in wholesale clothing in the South-Western Counties is noticeable. Activity has, however, been maintained in dressmaking and tailoring. In the Midlands, trade has, on the whole, been fairly good, but short-time has been worked at some places owing to the adverse weather conditions.POTTERY AND GLASS.Although there has been an improvement in the Midlands, the situation is not satisfactory for this season of the year. In London and the Home Counties, trade is quiet in the glass industry.   The glass-bottle industry has improved at Castleford.TRANSPORT.The London Docks are slack. Seasonal activity is manifest in the docks on the South-West Coast. In Wales, there has been an improvement at Swansea and Cardiff.   Unemployment has decreased on the North-East Coast.C, A.

SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN.[From Autumn 1920 onwards.] Cabinet Unemployment Committee.The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, the then Cabinet appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment. This Committee continued to function till October 1922. The present Government appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee on the 1st November, 1922.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos;&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. &apos; The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922 amalgamated the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extended until June 1923 the special periods during which benefit might be drawn.. The authority to borrow
money from the Treasury was increased to  30,000,000.   By the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1923, which came into operation on the 12th April, 1923, the special periods for the payment of benefit have been extended to October 1923.   Special provision has also been made by this Act for the following year to October 1924.Table, showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants), and the Contributions during the period from the 8th November, 1920, to the 23rd June, 1923.1.

Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from, autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 300,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 135,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work-provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits Scheme.(C.) Extensions of Remedial Measures during the Winter 1922-23.Some of the measures comprised in (B) above are still in operation, e.g., past sanctions of grants by the Unemployed Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport. The Export Credits Scheme continues, and schemes approved under the Trade Facilities Act are in progress.In June 1922: the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport issued circular letters to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the relief of unemployment in their respective areas. Approved schemes are assisted by grants made on the same bases as heretofore. In the case of schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee, particulars of grants already sanctioned are set out below.In September 1922, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circular letters to County Councils (except&apos; the London County Council) and Drainage Authorities, inviting them to submit schemes of land drainage which, if approved, might be assisted on fundamentally the same conditions as those applicable in theT10276] * 3
case of schemes assisted last year. All applications were to be received in the case of Drainage Authorities on or before December 1, 1.922, and in the case of County Councils (Agricultural Committees) on or before December 16, 1922. County Councils were also circulated with regard to schemes for the supply of water to farms, the conditions of assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries remaining substantially the same as last winter, with the exception that the Ministry, instead of advancing the whole cost ot any scheme and recovering a proportion from the owners concerned, will make grants to cover part only of the total cost of each scheme. Further circulars, issued to County Councils and Drainage Authorities on the 5th and 6th December respectively, notified the extension of the date up to which applications might be received to the 13th January, 1923, and invited the submission of additional schemes. The time for receiving applications was further extended provisionally to the 10th February, 1923. Particulars of grants sanctioned and of the number of men employed to date are shown below (see table 6).On the 30th November, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, outlined the manner in which measures taken by the late Government would be continued and extended. The additional sums promised in extension of existing funds are set out below :  &apos; Unemployment Grants Committee (for grants on the basis of60 per cent, of Wages Bill) ...        ... ... ...       600,000Land Drainage ... ...        ... ... ...        170,000Afforestation ... ... ...        ... ... ...        100,000Acceleration of Government contracts Office of Works......... 375,000General Post Office ... ... 946,000-     1,321,000It was also then announced that guarantees under the Trade Facilities Act Scheme would be made available up to  50,000,000 ( 25,000,000 extra); that the Export Credits Scheme would be extended if necessary; and that the Local Authorities concerned would be asked to co-operate ki putting in hand the Manchester-Liverpool Eoad, which would involve an expenditure of about  3,000,000, half of it from the Road Fund.In December 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee issued a further circular letter to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes suitable for assistance on the basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill, i.e., works the cost of which is normally defrayed out of revenue and not by loan. The conditions under which grants may be sanctioned are substantially the same as those previously in force, except that in the case of Rural Districts the Committee have discretion to allow, where clearly necessary,. a modification of the conditions regarding the giving of preference to 75 per cent, ex-service men and the engagement of labour through the Employment Exchanges.On the 12th December, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, further announced that, in addition to the acceleration of contracts by the Post Office and Office of Works, previously described, the Admiralty would accelerate miscellaneous works to a total of about  365,000; whilst the Home Office would put in hand certain accelerated building work, together with repairs to buildings, including Police Stations.On the 13th December, 1922, the Forestry Commission issued a press notice to the effect that forestry grants were available for the relief of unemployment on the same general conditions as those applicable to grants ma.de last winter. The sum of  100,000 referred to above is to be used partly for this purpose and partly for the purpose of relief schemes in Crown Forests and.for additional work in the Commission^ forests by the Trade Facilities and Loans Guarantee Act, 1922 (Session 2), enacted on the 15th December, 1922, formal sanction was given for the increase of the aggregate capital amount of loans the principal or interest of which mav be guaranteed under the Trade Facilities Act, 1921, from  25,000,000 to  50,000,000.On the 15th February, 1923, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, announced an extension of  5,600,000 in the amount available for grants in respect of approved road works by the Ministry of Transport.
