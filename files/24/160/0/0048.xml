&quot;[This Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.,]Printed for the Cabinet a q QSECRET.CP. 248 (23) (Also N.D. 33.)CABINET.FUTURE SIZE OF OUR REGULAR ARMY.Memoeandum by.the Chancellor of the Exchequer.3tlI SHARE the view of the Secretary of State for War (CP. 200 (23)) that it is most important to arrive at a definite and stable basis for the future organisation of the Army. In fact, when I proposed to him the total sum to be allocated to Army Votes for the current year, I coupled with my proposal the suggestion that an endeavour should be made in 1923 to reach a permanent solution of the problem.The following Memorandum must be regarded merely as a contribution to the study of the question. I agree that it would be false economy to reduce our military-strength below the margin of safety. On the other hand, the burden of national taxation is still so heavy, and the prospects of further relief depend so largely on OUr power to effect further economies of expenditure, that we are bound to examine with great care the possibility of reductions in numbers ; for on the numbers of the Army more than on any other single factor depends the scale of our military expenditure.Vote A for the Army for 1914-15-^-i.e., the maximum estimated number of troops paid from Army Votes, excluding, therefore, the British troops serving in India and certain native Colonial troops, such as the King&apos;s African Rifles, but including Colonial and Indian troops maintained outside India in oversea dependencies and North China-was for 186,400 officers and men.This number is further analysed as follows :-Regimental Establishments, British ... ... ... 169,500Permanent Staff of Territorial Force ... ... ... 3,058Staffs and Departments      ... ... ... ... 1,242Miscellaneous Establishments ... ... ... 1,529Total white troops   ... ... ...   175,329Colonial and Native and Indian Corps ... ...      8,771Additional numbers temporarily required to cover indian troops borne in excess of Estimates (China) ...      2,300Total Colonial and Native Indian        ...     11,071The white troops include : Royal Flying Corps, 1,429 ; Central Flying School, .103; total, 1,532.   If these be omitted the total British troops would be 173,797.The corresponding figure for Vote A (1923-24) is 170,800, and this can be further analysed as follows :-Regimental Establishments, British ...

The maintenance of garrisons oversea; - 2. The preservation of internal order in this country ; and 3. The provision of a striking force capable of being moved to a point of danger at short notice.In practice the maintenance of oversea garrisons set the pace for the strength of the Army. Under the Cardwell system it was necessary to maintain at home battalions corresponding to the white battalions abroad, and this home force supplied both the reserve strength, which was the ultimate bulwark of internal order, and the 6-Division Expeditionary Force. The strength of the Expeditionary Force was in fact determined by the number of troops available at home.The functions of the British Army remain very much as they were in 1914, but the conditions throughout the world have much changed. It is of course in relation to those conditions in the present and near future that we have to determine Army strength.In some respects world conditions have definitely reduced the liabilities of the British Army, quite apart from the defeat of Germany: -(o.) In 1914-15 a garrison of approximately 7,000 troops were maintained in South Africa. Since the war the Union of South Africa have undertaken the sole liability for their own military defence, thus coming on the same basis as Canada, Australia and New Zealand.(b.) India is reducing her demand for British troops from 52 battalions of . &quot; infantry to 45 battalions, besides a reduction of 130 men in each of the remaining battalions. The total reduction involves the British Army in India numbering something like 68,000 men as against 75,896 in 1914; and, though this reduction does not itself mean direct relief to the British taxpayer, it reduces our liability to provide troops on the Cardwell basis for reliefs and training, &amp;c, for India.(c.) The preservation of order in Southern Ireland the most anxious of the preoccupations of the pre-war home Army is now no longer a British Army liability.As against these, we have to set (a.) The more disturbed conditions in the Near East. These lead at present to a large number of troops being stationed at Constantinople and the Dardanelles and to an increase in the British garrison in Egypt;(6.) The assumption of mandates for Iraq and Palestine.It is true that there is reason to hope that the military liabilities at the present moment are greater in these respects than they will be in the comparatively near future. There are hopes that Lausanne may end in a peace with Turkey, a Constitu-tion for Egypt has been promulgated, and an indefinite continuance of the British garrison in Egypt at 12,525 all ranks, exclusive of Air Force, as compared with 6,264 before the war, need surely not be anticipated.

I do not pretend to be able to judge whether this development is for the public advantage or not. It would be so, no doubt, if the increase in Army Service Corps and similar services enabled, so to speak, two bayonets to do now the work of three before the War. If a disproportionately greater increase of effectiveness is obtained by developing the non-combatant side, then clearly we need not be unduly alarmed at reductions in numbers of personnel in the combatant arms, and further reductions may be possible in them. If, on the other hand, the growth of the non-combatant services indicates merely increased  elaboration ofAlthough Iraq is not primarily an Army liability, it is not unnatural that the General Staff should regard it as such in the event of a rising; but steps are being taken to reduce British military responsibility there. Palestine does not seem to be a serious military commitment. -Balancing these and other considerations against one another, I am not disposed to argue that a large reduction of the number of British troops is feasible or desirable, beyond the reduction of 19,261 which has been made in British personnel, unless there is some redistribution of the functions with which the British Army is charged. Even taking a hopeful view of the Near Eastern situation, I should expect 5,000 all ranks to be the maximum limit of reduction on the existing basis.I feel, however, that it must be pointed out that the British taxpayer has obtained no relief by the reduction of Army personnel as compared with 1914 because the growth of the Air Force has absorbed more than all the reductions. Vote A for the Air Force 1923-24 is 33,000, part of which is of course attributable to naval air service. Thus the advantages which this country woidd otherwise have obtained by the patriotic action of the Union of South Africa and the other circumstances mentioned above have already been neutralised by the growth of the Air Force, even if the apprehensions arising from the size of the French Air Force do not lead to the addition of a single squadron beyond those already authorised.But, as has already been announced, a considerable increase of the Air Force is almost inevitable, and therefore until an opportunity arises of arriving at some mutual accommodation with France the best we can hope to do is to see that there is no overlapping between the Army and Air Force and to utilise the growth of the latter to relieve the former. And here perhaps I may digress to point out that in the present state of the national finances public opinion will not tolerate an increase in our total expenditure on the fighting services, and although it is almost universally admitted that the Air Force must be increased it is very widely contended that the increased cost must be met by economies on the Army and Navy : for example, there has been a great deal of pointed criticism of the proposal to establish a naval base at Singapore. To return to my previous contention, there would seem to he an instance of overlapping in Egypt, where the Air Force (3 squadrons) apparently is regarded as a reserve for Air forces stationed in the Middle East and India, but is not regarded as part of the Egyptian garrison. It is not understood why, following our usual practice, they should not fulfil the dual function, thus relieving and reducing the present large numbers of British troops assigned to garrison Egypt- I hope that by this means and by the process of &quot; paring &quot; referred to by Lord Derby in his paper reduction up to the numbers I have suggested can be effected.But if no large reductions of military strength are possible, the distribution of the numbers between the various arms appears to require some attention. The following table sets out the percentages as compared with 1914-15 of the growth or decrease of the combatant and non-combatant arms :-
administration with, a diminishing return, of military efficiency, then a substantial reduction of these ancillary services appears to be called for. I observe that in 1921 the General Staff expressed the view that Army requirements for the essential purposes of to-day were &quot; the maximum number of fighting units, that is to say Infantry, Cavalry and Artillery,&quot; and not &quot; the pre-war Expeditionary Force with its elaborate organisation as a self-contained formation complete in every detail.&quot;The relatively low figure of our Army Reserves need not, I think, disturb us, in view of the numbers of young men with, war., experience who would, certainly rejoin the Colours on au emergency.I hope that the whole subject may be considered with a view to the maximum economy consistent with national safety. I can only repeat that the further much needed relief of the burdens of taxation can only be attained by reductions in expenditure. The area over which reductions are possible is growing steadily smaller, and if the projected increases in the Air Force are not at least counterbalanced by economies in the Army and Navy, the inevitable result will be the stabilisation of taxation at something very near to its present level, the consequence of which may easily be the substitution for the present Government of one whose regard for the defence services is not particularly marked.Treasury, 8.W. 1, May 17, 1923.
