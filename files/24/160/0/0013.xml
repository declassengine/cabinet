^SBOOUMFHT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)ITi&apos; CABINET.15(35)IRAQ.Paraphrase telegram  torn High Commissioner, Baghdad to Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Received 12.31 a.in. April 35th 1923.Clear the Line.Private.   No.350 of April 34th.It is of oourue inconvenient not&apos;to he able to say anything either to British personnel or to Iraqis, hut greatest difficulty that confronts His Majesty&apos;s Government is fully appreciated by me. Pros and cons of an announcement have been carefully considered by Dobbs and myself and King and Prime Minister have been con.fi-dentially sounded.It is the view of all of us that there is great pre-dominanoe of arguments in favour of making announcement at once Following are the arguments:-   Suspicion prevails among certain sections of Iraqis that we are leading Iraq publio to believe that policy contemplated towards them by His Majesty&apos;a Government is a very benevolent one,   in order that they may be kept quiet and hopeful pending our peace negotiations with Turks;   but that we shall change out attitude and revert to still control as soon as the signature of peace has dispelled Turkish menace.     Turkish agents are encouraging this apprehension.     It is important that this Bhould be removed.Best possible effect in Syria, Hejaz and Arabia generally, as well as in Iraq would be produced by publication.     People of Iraq would be stimulated to defend solidly against any Turkish threat the genuine independence   . . assured to them by our action. It will be brought home to Turks that Iraq is no more likely than the Hejaz to be recovered by them.
FintO.lv, in Kp;     of fact that policy has not been officially announced, both Turkey and Iraq have received intelligent forecast which was published in the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; and which many other papers in England reproduced.     The Baghdad vernacular press has commented upon it;   so has the &quot;Tannin&quot;. ,This refers to your private telegram of the 21st April.2 Whitehall Gardens, S,W.l. 26th April,  1923.
