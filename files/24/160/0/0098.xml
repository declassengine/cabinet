bitPrinted for the&apos;Cabinet.      July 1923.SECRET.CP. 300 (23)..   CABINET.When 0.P. 289 (23) regarding proposed reductions in the. strength of the Army in India was discussed on 27th June my colleagues expressed a wish for further information on the subject.I therefore circulate for the information of my colleagues the telegram below from the Government of India, which contains, I think, a full explanation of the position. PEEL.July 1923.From Viceroy, Finance Department, to Secretary of State for India,31st January 1923. &apos;In our budget telegram No. 66 F., dated 13th January, we informed you that it Introduotoi was our intention&apos; to restrict military budget for next year to a net figure of about 60-1- crores,&apos;as against current year budget of 6.7-f. crores. We added that the measures necessary to restrict expenditure to that figure were still under inyesti-gatidii, but that it was probable that we should be obliged to effect some reduction in number of British troops serving in India. We have now completed our enquiries in consultation with our military advisers, and can lay before you specific measures which we propose to adopt. In doing so, we think it desirable to give Bis Majesty&apos;s Government a general review of existing situation in India, military, financial and political, in order that they may appreciate, the reasons which have led us unanimously to the conclusion that there is no. alternative to the adoption of measures which we now propose.2. We need not dilate at any length upon the present state of India&apos;s finances, Financial which is well known to yourself \and to general public, both here and in England, position of Including probable deficit in current year, India has outspent her revenue during the Central and past five years by an amount of no less than 103 crores, winch has been financed Q^^J^ntg mainly by borrowing and partly by inflation of currency. The effect of these continuous deficits, involving, as they do, a progressive deterioration in India&apos;s general financial position and in her credit abroad, has been the cause of grave anxiety to yourself, your predecessor, and to ourselves. Strenuous efforts were made during the preparation of the previous two. budgets to obtain equilibrium- Increased taxation to an unprecedented extent has&apos; been imposed in two successive years against much popular opposition, and, as we shall show later, taxation in India, except perhaps, in one direction alone, has now reached a level that cannot at the moment be increased. Civil expenditure has been severely restricted. These measures have nevertheless failed to produce equilibrium. Our. deficit in the current year is estimated at. about 18  crores., while for the next year, if the military budget were retained at its figure for the current year, the deficit would be at least 16 crores, subject to what is said in para. 3. The finances of Provincial Governments., are in a similar state. Several of them are run pn large deficits, which have to be financed by overdrafts from us. Not only do those. Governments find it impossible, to allot funds for increased expenditure on objects such as education, industrial development, &amp;c, for which there is much popular demand; they have considerable difficulty in financing administration at a bed-rock level of efficiency. The position . of Ministers has in consequence become extremely difficult in several Provinces. . Most Provincial Governments have, imposed, or are in the course of imposing, con-siderable increased taxation, but it is clear that in their case equilibrium can only be obtained by fulfilment of our promise gradually to. reduce and finally to ajbulish. provincial contributions aggregating 9J crores, a measure which/ is, of course, impossible so long as our own expenditure continues, on its present scale. It Is not surprising, therefore, that there is throughout India, amongst&apos; all sections of opinion, both European and Indian, an unanimous insistence that the Budget of the Central Government should be made to balance. We know that this opinion is shared by you, for in your Despatch No. 18, Financial, dated 14th December 1922, your 6508     100  7.23 A[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]
Lordship impressed upon us the vital importance, from the point of view of India&apos;s credit in London, that we should attain budget equilibrium.Economies in 3. So far as civil expenditure is concerned, this, as we have already stated llascivil expenditure, been very seriously restricted for several years. We have not yet received final recommendations of Lord Ihchcape&apos;s Committee on Indian Expenditure. We are however, in touch with the progress made hy them, and we are in a position to sav that in civil expenditure a retrenchment of from 3 to 4 crores of rupees is the utmost that can be counted on.Possibilities of 4. With one exception, we consider that any further enhancement of taxationfurther taxation, this year is out of the question. The exception is the salt duty. This, as His Majesty&apos;s Government are aware, has always been regarded as ultimate reserve in case of any national emergency, such as war. Any increase now will be strong opposed on sentimental grounds, and, unless accompanied by large reduction in military expenditure, will undoubtedly be rejected by Legislature and by public opinion. For the purpose of restoring financial equilibrium, we are, however prepared to propose to the Legislature increasing of the salt duty, which, if doubled would yield in the first year of its imposition an additional i\ crores. As regards other sources of taxation, we have, in the course of past two years, made enhancements which are estimated to produce an additional 37 crores revenue annually. We have once more surveyed position with the utmost care, but have been forced to the conclusion that, in present circumstances, any further enhancements&apos; are impossible. In the first place, Indian public includes also the British commercial community, who, after the heavy additional taxation of the past two years, will not stand any further increase. Secondly, even if we could overcome public opposition, we do not consider that any further increases are likely to produce an appreciable amount of additional revenue. Our tariff is now so high that, in the case of certain articles, we fear that it has already passed the level of maximum return. Bate of income tax is now thrice that prevailing at the beginning of the war, while the super-tax is already as high as six annas in the rupee on the highest incomes. In the case of our commercial departments, namely, Railways and Posts and Telegraphs, the enhance-mciits of rates and fares made last year were large, and have unfortunately affected traffic considerably, and we are satisfied .that any further enhancement would be unproductive. &apos;Pivotal character 5. It is clear to us, therefore, that the whole problem pivots upon the militan-budget, and that, without a very substantial reduction in the military expenditure, equilibrium, is impossible. Question of lndia&apos;s military expenditure was considered by His Majesty&apos;s late Government this time last year, and we invite attention to the correspondence ending with Mr. Montagu&apos;s telegram No. 807, dated 22nd February 1922. Main proposal then made, to which His Majesty&apos;s Government were unable to agree, wTas that, although no immediate reduction of British troops was possible, in view chiefly of the internal political situation, we should he allowed to make a public pronouncement of our intention to make a reduction of five British battalions and three British cavalry regiments as soon as conditions permitted. The situation was such that, anxious though we were to reduce our military expenditure, we were unable to propose an immediate reduction of British troops. Treaty with Afghanistan had only been recently concluded, and its probable continuity had not been tested. Much more important, however, was the internal political situation. A highly dangerous propaganda, which openly aimed at the subversion of established Govern-ment, was being actively pursued throughout the country, and had already resulted in a number of breaches of order. So far the disturbances had been successfully suppressed, but, as mentioned in our telegram of the 5th February 1922, &quot;the indi-cations are that the extremists are about to stake their last card, and force on us an open trial of strength by the institution of civil disobedience. We do not seek to minimise the risk of serious and widespread disturbances which may result from this move on their part.&quot; Menacing though the position was, we nevertheless anticipated that before the end of 12 months the issue would have been decided one way or the other, and that either the risk of widespread disorders would have passed away, or our armed forces would be actively engaged in suppressing the disorders.6. The situation now before us is so far different as to relieve us of apprehensions which were entertained a year ago regarding result of any substantial reduction in our military strength.   Peaceful relations with Afghanistan have been continued and, weof military expenditure.Appreciation of present general situation.
may hope, have been pqnsp^c-at^d. In. our telegram ,1402/ 12tb November 1022, wp have mentioned and expressed ,ati;r agreement with opinion of bur Minister in Kabul that, even, in the event of war with Turkey, ah immediate breach with the..Amif need not be apprehended.; and as we explained later,&apos;it is postulated that, if hostilities with Turkey break out, contemplated.,reductipu of pur, military forces would have to&apos; be postponed. .As!, regards jnternal^situatfpn, forces which aimed at destruction of orderly government are now thoroughly discredited, and there is in addition much disunion&quot; among, them. Strong action taken against leaders of non-cb-operatihg movement, and&quot; the active steps taken by Provincial Governments to suppress any signs of disorder, have had, their effect.. ..The myth of Gaudhi&apos;s supernatural personality,is ,.exploded... The lessons of Moplah&apos;rebeUioji have sunk in. Political agitation of , course. continues,&apos; but it, is oh more constitutional liues: Our officers report that people as.j a whole are now. convinced of dangers and inutility of aaarchical; doctrjuejj. preiicjied, a year a go,, and that general sentiment of the country is ,behiiid; us, in -desiring., that : india&apos;s:. political development should proceed,on orderly.lines.. On the other,haiid, it would inevitably produce set-back in political situation, and would weaken, forces of co-operation and order, if we now produced another budget showing a. large deficit, and with ho substantial reduction in military expenditure. ,To ensure, continuance, of present improved situation, it is worth taking,.some small amount.of risk, anpl, as we shall show subsequently; the risk involved,in our proposals is, we. are convinced, hot excessive. We are fully aware of the danger of:undue op.ti.mism in speaking . of. a country which contains much inflammable material... Nevertheless, we consider that, as.far as we. can now foresee, the only danger of any serious disorder is from certain sections of the Muhammadah community inthe unhappy ;and, we trust, improbable event of hostilities arising with Turkey. Last year we felt obliged to hedge, inpur proposals for a reduction in British troops by a number pi;.stipulations regarding possible contingencies. On this occasion we have only to make one principal stipulation, iiamely, that a breakdown of the Lausanne- Conference, if it resulted iii hostilities with Turkey,&apos; might necessitate postponement of the measure which we now advocate.X- the Cbniinancler-ih-Ohief, we heed hardly say, concurs in our appreciation of Commander-in-t.he financial position.- , lie recognises that: it is necessary to reach equilibrium, and Chiefs attitude, that, all ptherhieans having been exhausted, it is impracticable to attain equilibrium  0-12^ PM**&apos; in present circumstances without a reduction of military expenditure.  The Commander-iu-Chief. shares also our view of external political situation, and although in his minute of, dissent dated 3rd October 1922, substance of which was communicated to you in pur Army Department telegram, 1271, dated 3rd October 1922, he emphasised the uncertainty of internal situation, he readily admits that internal situation also, exhibits marked improvement as compared.with a year ago.   lie has accordingly framed proposals which will yield the maximum reduction.of Army Estimates which can,be achieved without going below Hie absolute margin of safety which he considers it essential to maintain.   These proposals do not by themselves enable its to obtain exact equilibrium, but ttey take us as far in that direction as we, with the concurrence of the commander-in-Chief, consider to be feasible.8. Full details of proposed measures of reductions in military expenditure, and Measures of their precise financial effect,, are given in a -separate telegram; which is being military reduc-despatched simultaneously with this.   Some are largely matters, of estimate, pthers t,ons proposed&apos; are the result of- economies which we propose to effect in administrative.services and which dp not directly affect the. fighting efficiency: of. the-Army.... The. measures which involve reduction-of the fighting troops&apos;, and the military considerations 01.1 which tbey are held to be justified, are, as follows. . We way observe at this point that obviously reduction of expenditure, to the. extent, necessitated . by, financial considerations can only be effected by reduction of. British, troops.   It would be. out of the question to make the reduction in Indian troops which would yield the same amount of money., (1) Reductions in,strength of each, battalion of British infantry by 13(3 men; that is,to say, 1,012 to 882. .F6r several years actual strength of British infantry in India has been ^ short of authorised establishment. some 4,000, or 5,000 lheh, aid during these years no .untoward result has occurred, although-the external - -and internal dangers were much greater than they are at present.. The -military disad-vautage of reductions here mentioned is that the reduced battalion strength, will hot leave sufficient margin in India to meet fully the wastage which would occur shortly 6508 j, A 2
after the commencement of operations. This, however, is a risk which the Com-mander-in-Chief thinks may safely be taken, provided that the War Office can arrange for the despatch of drafts up to 2,500 men immediately on the declaration of war, for those battalions which are then in the Field Army or covering force. On the other hand, it is.clearly preferable to reduce establishment, as we. here propose, rather than to reduce units as proposed by Military Requirements Committee of 1921, for the reason that it is an easier matter to expand an existing cadre.in war time than to raise entirely new unit. Moreover, under the present proposal, no station in India which is now guarded by a British infantry detachment need be deprived of that protection.(2) Reduction of three British cavalry regiments; namely, one at Lucknow, forming part,of 4th Cavalry Brigade of&quot; the Field Army, and two now provided for internal security and located at Mhow and Bangalore. As will appear subsequently, we propose the abolition of one Cavalry Brigade, and this will entail abolition of British cavalry regiment which is at present stationed at Lucknow. The other two British cavalry regiments would be taken from the forces allowed to internal security. Though it cannot be denied that, on occasion, British cavalry might be of great assistance in internal security, yet, up to date, their services have seldom been made use of for this purpose, and it ia considered, therefore, that the units at Mhow and Bangalore are those which can best be spared. In Southern India, to compensate for the withdrawal of these regiments, some re-allotment of British troops will be necessary, hut the Commander-in-Chief considers that an efficient re-allotment can,be arranged; and he also proposes that as soon as our establishment in Armoured Car Companies, which is now six companies, is made up to eight, the two new companies shall be allotted to Mhow and Bangalore.(3) Abolition of 4th Indian Cavalry Brigade involves, in addition, as regards British troops, the abolition of one Royal Horse Artillery battery and ammunition column. We have at preseut available for the Field Army five cavalry brigades. Three of these are complete. The fourth and fifth brigades each lack a regiment of Indian cavalry,&apos; while the fifth brigade lacks, in addition, a Cavalry Brigade Signal Troop. Abolition of the 4th Cavalry Brigade would appear to be the least disadvantageous measure to take. This brigade on mobilisation for external war is kept, together with (he 5th Indian Cavalry Brigade, as a reserve in the hands of the Commander-in-Chief, ,and the reduction proposed is that least likely to upset the balance of the Field Army as a whole, and least likely to cause a dislocation in the General Staff plans. It is, therefore, proposed to abolish the 4th Cavalry Brigade with the consequent reduction of its headquarters, one British cavalry regiment, one Royal Horse Artillery battery and ammunition column, and one Field Troop of Sappers and Miners. The Indian Cavalry Regiment and the Cay airy Brigade Signal Troop in cadre form would complete the 5th Cavalry Brigade. .   ,,.(4) Abolition of one Royal Field Artillery, brigade. At present, each of the first three divisions of Field Army has two brigades of Royal Field Artillery and one brigade of Pack Artillery, while the fourth division has three brigades of Royal Field Artillery, It is proposed to abolish one of. these latter three brigades as being obviously the least disadvantageous reduction that can be made.(5) Reduction of 64 sepoys in each of 80 active Indian infantry battalions, and in each of nine active Pioneer battalions. The Gurkhas and training battalions would remain untouched. To compensate for reduction, we propose to form a new Class I. Reserve, to consist of 77 men for each of the active Indian infantry battalions and each of the nine active Pioneer battalions. The new Class I. reservists would consist of men combining colour with reserve service, and they would receive special,terms as regards reserve pay and pension. The project is in the nature of au experiment which, if found to be successful, would open up large possibility of, further economy without sacrifice of essential efficiency. Precise details of this measure will be placed before you in another separate telegram.9. The above proposals involve the following aggregate reductions in present authorised establishment: Fighting troops : British officers 120, British other ranks 8,422, Indian, ranks 6,184. If they are.adopted, the proportion of British to Indian troops, worked out on the lines given in table &quot;;B &quot; at page 121 of the Report of Military Requirements Committee of ,1921, will stand at 1 to 2&quot;G7. The observations made already in regard to proposed reduction of British infantry apply also to the disturbance of the ratio.   The standard ratio has never been worked up to in recent years and.the
failure to maintain it lias not in actual fact affected prejudicially the military situation. - .10. In recommending these measures we have the whole  support of the View of Com-Commander-in-Ohief.   He regards them as necessary in the circumstances m which mander in-Oh we are placed, and considers that they do not involve a risk which the Government ^ove)&quot; pam&apos; of India would not be justifiod in taking, and that reductions being necessary the &apos; reductions proposed are those which will be the least deleterious in their results on the efficiency of the Army as a whole and on its state of preparedness for war.previous slug :orsuperseded.11. In giving its support to our recommendations the Commander-in-Chief has necessarily stated certain qualifications, which are, however, of a kind which can readily be&quot; accepted. In the first instance, of course, the Commander-in-Chief relies on the postulate already stated, namely, that ii war with Turkey were to break out the reductions which have been proposed would not be carried out. The Commander-in-Chief has stipulated, that the reduction of British infantry should be conditional on the War Office being prepared to send out 2,500 drafts immediately on the outbreak of war. There should be no difficulty in securing the War Office agreement to this arrangement, as they will maintain continuously at our cost in England a much larger number of men under training, from whom the requisite number could be selected in .an emergency. Finally, the Commander-m-Chief naturally claims that these measures of reduction, if adopted, shall be held to supersede, to the extent stated below, all -other recommendations for reduction of the Army in India which have been put pr^T. forward in the recent past. The recommendations which the Commander-in-Chief suggestions f. has in mind are :- reductions to(I) The proposals of the Military Requirements Committee, 1921.(2) The reduction of four battalions of Indian infantry in the covering troops, adumbrated as the possible outcome of the larger employment of irregulars in Waziristan.(3) The proposal to reduce the Fourth Division of the Field Army in consideration of an increase of two squadrons of the Royal Air Force.Stated in brief detail, the Commander-iu-Chiefs views in regard to these three measures are as follows :--Firstly. From the military point of view it would have been entirely unsuitable to take, as the basis of the reductions now held to be necessary, the proposals of the Military Requirements Committee and to append to these further separate reductions to the extent necessary to secure financial retrenchment in view from the outset. In view of the financial hypothesis laid down, the Commander-in-Chief discarded the scheme of the Military Requirements Committee and has elaborated, to supersede it, a scheme which would secure, so far as possible, required, economy, and would maintain, with as little impairment as possible, our general army organisation and means of defence.Secondly. The reduction of four battalions of Indian infantry in the covering-troops is a separate matter depending on separate contingencies which have not yet arisen. It may still be possible to carry out, but this must be considered afresh when the contingencies in question arise, and in the light of general position then obtaining.Thirdly. The Commander-in-Chief, from the very beginning, refused to lend his countenance to the proposal to abolish the 4th Field Army Division. He did so primarily for the reasons given in his minute of dissent, namely, that the potentialities of the Royal Air Force as a substitute for ground troops had not been proved, but he also held, and sfiil holds strongly, that the reduction of the 4th Division, added to the reductions proposed by the Military Requirements Committee, would be, from the military point of view, a harmful and entirely unsuitable method of reducing military expenditure. It is obvious to him, therefore, that if the reductions of British troops now proposed are carried out, further reductions of ground troops would be wholly impracticable, even if two squadrons should eventually be added to the Royal Air Force. We note here that question of creating these two extra squadrons will not arise in a practical form until the existing six squadrons have been restored to full efficiency, vide Army Department Despatch No. 6, dated the 18th January 1.923, and until we have more practical experience of the actual results that can be attained from *ir operations against frontier tribesmen.
Conmiander-in-Chiefsviewas to future standard of defence..-Wazinstan.Reasons why -views regarding military i&apos;e-. duotioii were not -submitted before.Inohcape Com-mittee&apos;s opinion ou military reductions.,: ! : 12. Commander-in-Chief also desires to make it clear that his decision to support the present recommendations must not be construed as meaning that he rejects once and for all, as unnecessarily high, the standard o  defence which waspreviouslyadopted in the post-war organisation of the Army in India. The Gommancier-hi-Chief regards the proposed reductions as not imperilling the safety of India, and as involving less harm to the general administration of the country than would be likely to follow from the continuance of the present financial deterioration. . On the other&apos; hand, he regards them as determined. primarily by financial ^considerations, and lie claims that&apos; the necessities, of the moment should not- be, regarded as determining the reductions for all time. He contemplates that, if and when the resources at the disposal of the Government of India increase, the Government of India, as they will, aim at making more liberal provision for schemes of social and material betterment should also be prepared to allot funds for the purpose of increasing the strength of our fighting troops.13. It should be understood that the proposals, set forth in this telegram do not] in any w.ay affect the prosecution of the policy adopted in regard to Waziristan, except) to this extent: that provision for the construction of the Sarardgha-Razmak and Jandola-Sarwekai roads for the time being omitted, the amount would, of course, have I to he restored if it was subsequently decided that these roads must be built.14. You will readily appreciate the reasons why we have not previously addressed j you by despatch on the subject of military reductions, as desired in your pre-predecessor&apos;s telegram No. 807, dated 22ncl February 1922. In the first instance, we) were-awaiting the Report of the Sub-Committee of theCommitt.ee of Imperial Defence, and the conclusions of His Majesty&apos;s Government thereon, and, in the, interval, other! individual possibilities of reducing military expenditure have come before us. Wei -have referred to some of these in an earlier passage of this telegram, and the question j has, of&apos; course, again come forward in its general aspect in connection with the I enquiries of\the Retrenchment Committee. We have now, however, in this telegram,I given you a &quot;full appreciation of the military and other considerations by which the! proposals of vthe Commander-in-Chief and the Government of India have been! governed. It only remains to add that, although &quot;Lord Inchcape&apos;s Committee have! not yet submitted their final recommendations regarding retrenchment of military! expenditure, we have ascertained from Lord Inchcape that there is not one of the! -proposals which we have put forward which would hot be included in their recom-j mendations, and that they are of opinion that the reductions of British troops to the! extent proposed by the Commander-in-Chief are absolutely essential to the restoration! of our finances, and that these reductions must form the central pivot on which thehi recommendations will turn.
