DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)./3C R E ,T. CABINET.CP .275 (23).--&apos; &apos; &apos; PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE.MEMORANDUM TO THE PRIME MINISTER BY THE PAR-&quot;ElAiViEi^TARY SECRETARY TO TfTE TREASURY. Circulated by direction of the Prime Minister.)In a letter written to the late Prime Minister theChief Whip of the Labour Party, on behalf of his Party, putforward the suggestion that a Select Committee should beappointed to consider the question of procedure in the Houseof Commons, as regards hours of sitting and the yearly session,and to report whether any changes are considered desirable forthe more efficient dispatch of business.The main proposal which would be considered by anysuch committee would be the suggestion that the House ofCommons should, start its sessions in November instead of, as , &apos;is now the usual practice, in February, and the advantages which are claimed for this proposal are that it would then bepossible for the Address in reply to the Gracious Speech fromthe Throne to be moved in November, and second readings ofimportant Government measures to be taken before Christmas,thus leaving the time after Christmas more free for essentialfinancial business, so that this end all other business of the session could be concluded before the end of July.I desire to submit for decision the question as towhether a Select Committee of the House of Commons or a joint select Committee of both Houses, as suggested, should be setup, and I would also submit that, if you approved of this
Select Committee, the terme of reference should be kept within a narrow limit so that the whole question of pro-oedure of Parliament should not be subjected again to an exhaustive examination, but. kept to the one point on whicha decision is desired?&quot;To consider the desirability of altering the customary period of the Parliamentary Session and the necessary changes incidental thereto.&quot;1 would remind $cnx that in July 1914 a SelectCommittee of the House of Commons was appointed -&quot;To consider and report whether any and, if so, what alterations are desirable in the practice and procedure of the House with regard to public business.&quot;After thirteen meetings and examining eleven witnesses adraft report was agreed to but the Committee recommended tothe House that a Committee be appointed to deal with thesubject next session, as they had not entered upon detailed consideration of the draft report.     No Committee has beenappointed since 1914.The Committee proposed in their draft report, -1.   That the House ahotild meet in November, pass the Address, set up the Committees of Supply and $ays and Means and dispose of the supplementary estimates before Christmas;2.   That the Session should terminate not later than July 15th, and there should be a Standing Order to that effect.The opinions expressed by members of the House on&apos; these proposals differed considerably and It should be noted that both Mr, Asquith and Mr, Speaker Lowther were of opinion that the meeting of the House In November would be no guarantee whatever that the Summer Session would be shortened, in fact it would probably mean prolonging it as there would be no dead-end, as at Christmas, when bills, which cannot be got through before the Recess, are dropped,
12 Downing Street, S.W. 12th June, 1923.On the other hand Mr. Gulland, a Whip of the Literal Party, favoured the proposal, and was of opinion that the congestion of business before the 31st March must be relieved.It in interesting also to note that Mr.Speaker Lowther was in favour of a Recess during August, September and October, and suggested a Standing Order to say that, directly the Appropriation Bill is passed, after Supply is closed, the Hou3e should do no further business until the Autumn.I should be of your decision on this subject,which has been pressed on me by the Opposition for the past few months.(Signed)     LESLIE WILSON.
