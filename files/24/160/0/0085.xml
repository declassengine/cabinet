[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1923. **SECRET.CP. 287 (23). CABINET.SPECIAL REPORT ON  UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 94.     Period ended June 15, 1923.SUMMARY OF UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.The number of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as wholly unemployed at the&apos; 11th June was 1,197,052, an increase of 10,005 on the previous week.POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.COAL-MINING.In Lancashire, the Midlands and the Forest of Dean colliers have been fully employed. Unemployment in the Yorkshire and Durham coal-fields has further decreased. In Scotland, employment has continued steady, while activity has been maintained in the Welsh collieries.IRON AND STEEL.There have been signs of improvement at certain centres in the Midlands, but unemployment generally has remained heavy. In Yorkshire and the North-Eastern Counties, the situation has improved, but the effects of the industrial dispute among, the boilermakers is retarding real progress. There has been a decline in the position in Scotland, and the industry there is unsettled. The output in North Wales has been maintained and increased activity has been evident in certain districts in South Wales.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.Slackness has obtained at Portsmouth and Southampton. The industrial dispute among the boilermakers has continued to hamper activity on the North-East Coast and in Scotland. The shipyards at Liverpool have been very busy on repairing and reconditioning work: no constructional work has been possible owing to the continuance of the dispute. Unemployment is heavy at most of the Welsh shipyards.   .ENGINEERING.Discharges have taken place from certain firms in the Home Counties. The slow improvement in the South-Western Counties has continued. The improvement in the motor and cycle section in the Midlands has not been so marked recently, but in general engineering the tendency towards progress has been maintained. In Lancashire, some improvement has occurred in general engineering, but textile-machinery manufacture has been slack. A further slight depression has taken place in Yorkshire and the North of England.   Trade is still depressed in Scotland.
TEXTILES.Cotton. In Lancashire, curtailed production has continued in the spinning section, and employment in the cloth-weaving section has been poor. There has been no improvement in the position in Yorkshire.Hosiery, Woollen and Worsted. There has been a further depression in Yorkshire and the North of England. Trade has continued slack in the Midlands and no improvement is anticipated until weather conditions improve. In Scotland, difficulty may be experienced in maintaining the present working hours.Lace. Apart from the curtain-making section, which has continued to be fairly well employed, the depression in this industry in the Midlands has not been relieved. In the South-Western Counties unemployment has increased.Silk. Depression has continued in the Midlands.Jute. The resumption of work as the result of the settlement of the industrial dispute has given an impetus to trade, and the outlook is now much brighter.BUILDING.Building operations have continued generally to absorb operatives, but much unemployment exists in certain districts among unskilled workers.BOOT AND SHOE.There has been a slight improvement at certain centres in the South-Western Counties. Unemployment in the Midlands is still considerable, but trade in certain towns has continued active.  Unsettled weather is retarding seasonal employment.CLOTHING.Tailoring and dressmaking have continued good in the Midlands and the South-Western Counties. The making-up trades in the Midlands have been working short-time as a result of the adverse weather conditions.POTTERY, EARTHENWARE AND GLASS.The tendency towards improvement in the pottery industry in the Midlands continued. Unemployment among glass-bottle workers has increased at Mexborough and Wakefleld, but the position has improved slightly at Gateshead. xTRANSPORT. IIncreased activity has continued on the Mersey. The Avonmouth Docks have been very busy, and shipping at Bristol has considerably improved. Many transport workers are still unemployed at Southampton. The situation on the North-East Coast is on the whole very quiet, but at South Shields and Hartlepool there is much activity. Employment is good at Liverpool, but little improvement is observed at the Welsh ports.C. A. MONTAGUE BARLOW, Ministry of Labour.
I. DETAILED UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES.. 1. General Percentage of Unemployment.[Note. Down to November 1920 the only percentages of unemployment available are those derived from Trade Onion returns covering roughly 1.000,000 workers.

[From Autumn 1920 onwards.]Cabinet Unemployment Committee.The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, the then Cabinet appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment. This Committee continued to function till October 1922. The present Government appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee on the 1st November, 1922.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. (Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary. Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, amalgamated the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extended until June 1923 the special periods during which benefit might be drawn.   The authority to borrow
money from the Treasury was increased to  30,000,000. By the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1923, which came into operation on the 12th April, 1923, the special periods for the payment of benefit have been extended to October 1923. Special provision has also been made by this Act for the following year to October 1924.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants), and the Contributions during the period from the 8th November, 1920, to the 9th June, 1923.1.

Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 300,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 143,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits Scheme.(C.) Extensions of Remedial Measures during the Winter 1922-23.Some of the measures comprised in (B)-above are still in operation, e.g., past sanctions of grants by the Unemployed Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport. The Export Credits Scheme continues, and schemes approved under the Trade Facilities Act are in progress.In June 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport issued circular letters to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the relief of unemployment in their respective ar^as. Approved schemes are assisted by grants made on the same bases as heretofore. In the case of schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee, particulars of grants already sanctioned are set out below;In September 1922, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circular letters to County Councils (except the London County Council) and Drainage Authorities, inviting them to submit schemes of land drainage which, if approved, might be assisted on fundamentally the same conditions as those applicable in the[10204] r 3 126,180,000 9,956,000 1,170,000137,306,00098,902,00038,404,000137,306,000
ease of schemes . assisted last year. All applications . were to . be received -in- the ease of Drainage Authorities on .or before December 1, 1922, and in the&apos; case of County Councils (Agricultural Committees) on or before December 16, 1922. County Councils were also circulated with regard to schemes for the supply of water to farms, the conditions of assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries remaining substantially the same as last winter, with the exception that the Ministry, instead of advancing the whole cost ot any scheme and recovering a proportion from the owners concerned, will make grants to cover part only of the total cost of each scheme. Further circulars, issued to County Councils and Drainage Authorities on the 5th and 6th December respectively, notified the extension of the date up to which applications might be received to the 13th January, 1923, and invited the submission of additional schemes. The time for receiving applications was further extended provisionally to the 10th February, 1923. Particulars of grants sanctioned and of the number of men employed to date are shown below (see table 6).On the 30tb November, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, outlined the manner in which measures taken by the, late Government would be continued and extended. The additional sums promised in extension of existing funds are set out below : Unemployment Grants Committee (for grants on the basis of 60 per cent, of Wages Bill) ...        ... ...Land DrainageAfforestation ...        ...        ...        ... ...      - ..jAcceleration of Government contracts Office of Works    ...        ...   &apos;     ... 375,000&apos;General Post Office ...        ... 946,000-     1,321,000It was also then announced that guarantees under the Trade Facilities Act Scheme would be made available up to  50,000,000 ( 25,000,000 extra); that the Export Credits Scheme would be extended if necessary; and that the Local Authorities concerned would be asked to co-operate in putting in hand the Manchester-Liverpool Road, which would involve an expenditure of about  3,000,000, half of it from the Road Fund. x!; In December 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee issued a further circular letter to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes suitable for assistance on the basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill, i.e., works the cost of which is normally defrayed out of revenue and not by loan. The conditions under which grants may be sanctioned are substantially the same as those previously in force, except that in the case of Rural Districts the Committee have discretion to allow, where clearly necessary, a modification of the conditions regarding the giving of preference to 75 per cent, ex-service men and the engagement of labour through the Employment Exchanges.On the 12th December, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, further announced that,, in addition to the acceleration of contracts by the Post Office and Office of Works,, previously described, the Admiralty would accelerate miscellaneous works to a total of about  365,000; whilst the Home Office would put in hand certain accelerated building work, together with repairs to buildings, including&quot;Police Stations.On the 13th December, 1922, the Forestry Commission issued a press notice to the effect that forestry grants were available for the relief of unemployment on the same general conditions as those applicable to- grants made last winter. The sum of  100,000 referred to above is to be used partly for this purpose and partly for the purpose of relief schemes in Crown Forests and for additional work in the Commission^ forests by the Trade Facilities and Loans Guarantee Act, 1922 (Session 2), enacted on the 15th December, 1922, formal sanction was given for the increase of the aggregate capital amount of loans the principal or interest of which may be guaranteed under the Trade Facilities Act, 1921, from  25,000,000 to  50,000,000;On the 15th February, 1923, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, announced an extension of  5,600;000&apos; in the- amount available for grants in respect of-approved road works by the Ministry of Transport. 600,000 170,000 100,000
