May 1923.-..........-----------------------------------------------136SECRET.18G.P. 220 (23). CABINET.SPECIAL REPORT ON  UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 90.    Period ended April 20, 1923.SUMMARY OF UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.The number of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as wholly unemployed at the 16th April was 1,239,525, a decrease of 21,145 on the previous week.POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.GOAL-MINING.The activity in the Forest of Dean, in Lancashire and the Midlands has been maintained, and immediate prospects are good. Employment in the Yorkshire and Durham coalfields continues good. In Wales the position generally is better; output has increased, and the supply available for shipment has been replenished. Trade continues to be brisk in Scotland.IRON AND STEEL.The hitherto intermittent improvement in certain branches of the trade in the Midlands has now become steadier, consequent upon an increase in the supply of coke. The activity in Yorkshire and the North of England continues. Increased activity is reported from Lancashire, where the outlook is promising. The position in North Wales continues good, and the situation in South Wales is better. The industry in Scotland continues to show improvement.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.The outlook in the South-Western Counties is not so good as it was a fortnight ago, but on the Tyne and Tees the position generally is improving slightly, and immediate prospects are fairly good. Activity at Barrow and on the Mersey continues to increase. In South Wales, there has been no marked improvement in the general situation. In Scotland, the industry is unsettled. There is a threat of a labour dispute in the industry.ENGINEERING.The situation in the Home Counties remains more or less stationary, but in the South-Western Counties improvement is occurring rather more rapidly. In the Midlands, the motor and cycle section is now comparatively quiet on the whole, although the slight improvement in general engineering continues. In spite of a slight improvement which has occurred in Yorkshire and the North of England, the outlook is not regarded as hopeful. The situation in Lancashire remains unchanged.   In Scotland and Wales the industry is still in a depressed condition.TEXTILES.Cotton. In Lancashire, the spinning section continues to restrict output: the weaving section is very depressed, and the outlook is not good. The general position in Yorkshire has become worse.
Hosiery, Woollen and Worsted. The hosiery trade in the Midlands has not improved, and conditions in the woollen and worsted section in the West Riding of Yorkshire are uncertain. Short-time working prevails generally in the hosiery and woollen and worsted trades in Scotland.Silk. Trade is depressed in the Midlands, except in the artificial silk industry, which continues to show some activity.Lace. Trade has improved at Chard, Ilminster and Exeter, and a slight revival is reported from Nottingham, where, however, although the home markets are fair, the export trade remains depressed. Trade continues fair in the curtain and plain net section at Beeston (Notts.).Jute. The dispute at Dundee has now been satisfactorily settled, and work has been resumed.BUILDING.The suspension of the threatened industrial dispute will, it is reported, result in increased activity in the future: up to the present, however, no decided improve-ment has occurred.BOOT AND SHOE.Some improvement is reported at Norwich, but trade is still very slack at Kingswood (Bristol). At Derby, Stafford, Yiforcester, Chesterfield and Mansfield trade is very good, and a very slight improvement is evident at Northampton. The situation at Wellingborough and Leicester is fair, but at Kettering and Hinckley the industry is depressed.CLOTHING.In the Home Counties, the South-Western Counties and the Midlands some seasonal improvement is apparent, and the immediate prospects are good.POTTERY AND GLASS.A slight improvement in the pottery industry is reported at Chesterfield, Stoke and Burslem, but at Hanley trade remains quiet. The settlement of the industrial dispute may result in a revival.TINPLATE.Employment in Waies remains good, and shows a slight improvement on the previous position.TRANSPORT.Most of the London Docks are slack, but the position at the Surrey Docks shows some improvement. The docks in the South-Western sector of the country are also slack, but some improvement has been recorded at Avonmouth. On the North-East Coast the situation is steady, and improvement is expected in the near future. Increased opportunities of employment are arising at Liverpool. The position at Newport and Swansea is better, but slackness is still the rule at Cardiff and Barry.C. A. MONTAGUE BARLOW, Ministry of Labour.

SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN.[From Autumn 1920 onwards.] Cabinet Unemployment Committee,The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, the then Cabinet appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment. This Committee continued to function till October 1922. The present Government appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee on the 1st November, 1922.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a. special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, amalgamated the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extended until June 1923 the special periods during which benefit might be drawn.   The authority to borrow
money from the Treasury was increased to  30,000,000. By the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1923, which came into operation on the 12th April, 1923, the special periods for the payment of benefit have been extended to October 1923. Special provision has also been made by this Act for the following year to October 1924.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants), and the Contributions during the period from the 8th November, 1920, to the 14th April, 1923.1.

Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Eeport. At least 300,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 149,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits Scheme.(C.) Extensions of Remedial Measures during the Winter 1922-23.Some of the measures comprised in (B) above are still in operation, e.g., past sanctions of grants by the Unemployed Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport. The Export Credits Scheme continues, and schemes approved under the Trade Facilities Act are in progress.In June 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport issued circular letters to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the relief of unemployment in their respective areas. Approved schemes are assisted by grants made on the same bases as heretofore. In the case of schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee, particulars of grants already sanctioned are set out below.In September 1922, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circular letters to County Councils (except the London County Council) and Drainage Authorities, inviting them- to submit schemes of land drainage which, if approved, might be assisted on fundamentally the same conditions as those applicable in the [9891] e 3
case of schemes assisted last year. All applications were to be received in the case of Drainage Authorities on or before December 1, 1922, and in the case of County Councils (Agricultural Committees) on or before December 16, 1922. County Councils were also circulated with regard to schemes for the supply of water to farms, the conditions of assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries remaining substantially the same as last winter, with the exception that the Ministry, instead of advancing the whole cost ot any scheme and recovering a proportion from the owners concerned, will make grants to cover part only of the total cost of each scheme. Further circulars, issued to County Councils and Drainage Authorities on the 5th and 6th December respectively, notified the extension of the date up to which applications might be received to the 13th January, 1923, and invited the submission of additional schemes. The time for receiving applications was further extended provisionally to the 10th February, 1923. Particulars of grants sanctioned and of the number of men employed to date are shown below (see table 6).On the 30th November, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, outlined the manner in which measures taken by the late Government would be continued and extended. The additional sums promised in extension of existing funds are set out below :  Unemployment Grants Committee (for grants on the basis of60 per cent, of Wages Bill) ... ... ... ...        600,000Land Drainage ... ... ... ... ...        170,000Afforestation ... ... ... ... ... ...        100,000Acceleration of Government contracts Office of Works    ... ...... 375,000General Post Office ... ... 946,000-     1,321.000It was also then announced that guarantees under the Trade Facilities Act Scheme would be made available up to  50,000,000 ( 25,000,000 extra); that the Export Credits Scheme would be extended if necessary; and that the Local Authorities concerned would be asked to co-operate in putting in hand the Manchester-Liverpool Road, which would involve an expenditure of about  3,000,000, half of it from the Road Fund.In December 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee issued a further circular letter to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes suitable for assistance on the basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill, i.e., works the cost of which is normally defrayed out of revenue and not by loan. The conditions under which grants may be sanctioned are substantially the same as those previously in force, except that in the case of Rural Districts the Committee have discretion to allow, where clearly necessary, a modification of the conditions regarding the giving of preference to 75 per cent, ex-service men and the engagement of labour through the Employment Exchanges.On the 12th December, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, further announced that, in addition to the acceleration of contracts by the Post Office and Office of Works, previously described, the Admiralty would accelerate miscellaneous works to a total of about  365,000; whilst the Home Office would put in hand certain accelerated building work, together with repairs to buildings, including Police Stations.On the 13th December, 1922, the Forestry Commission issued a press notice to the effect that forestry grants were available for the relief of unemployment on the same general conditions as those applicable to grants made last winter. The sum of  100,000 referred to above is to be used partly for this purpose and partly for the purpose of relief schemes in Crown Forests and for additional work in the Commission^ forests by the Trade Facilities and Loans Guarantee Act, 1922 (Session 2), enacted on the 15th December, 1922, formal sanction was given for the increase of the aggregate capital amount of loans the principal or interest of which mav be guaranteed under the Trade Facilities Act, 1921, from  25,000,000 to  50,000,000.On the 15th February, 1923. the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, announced, an extension of  5,600,000 in the amount available for grants in respect of approved road works by the Ministry of Transport.
