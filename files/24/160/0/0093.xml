[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.,!Printed for the Cabinet.      July 1923.CABINET.Question of removing the Legal Disability of certain High Officials in India in respect of taking leave to Europe during their term of office.I have recently been considering whether modern conditions would not justify a change in the Statute which at present lays down that &quot; if the Governor-General, or a Governor, or the Commander-in-Chief of His Majesty&apos;s forces in India, and, save in the case of absence on special duty or on leave under a medical certificate, if any member of the Executive Council of the Governor-General (other than the Commander-in-Chief), or any member of the Executive Council of a Governor or of a Lieutenant-Governor, departs from India intending to return to Europe, his office shall thereupon become vacant &quot; (Government of India Act, section 87). The terms of the law are precise and stringent. Neither the Governor-General, nor the Commander-in-Chief, nor any of the nine Governors, may in any circumstances proceed to Europe during his five years&apos; tenure without ipso facto vacating his office ; nor may any member of the Central or the Provincial Executive Councils (there are 30 members, of whom 1.5 are British officials) do so except on special duty or on sick leave.This particular provision dates from 1793, and has survived all the amendments that have been made in the constitution of India since that date ; but it has not been left unchallenged. Amending Bills were introduced in 1888, 1891 and 1892; and although none of them passed into law their demise was due not to an adverse vote but to accidental causes. Proposals for amendment were also made by the Govern-ment of India in 1902 and in 1921. On both occasions the Secretary of State&apos;s reply said in effect little more than that a suitable opportunity of legislating was not at the time in prospect.   The question has, in fact, been left open for some time past.I do not wish at this stage to go at length into the subject or to place definite proposals before my colleagues, but to invite their attention to the subject, and to ask them for an assurance that, on the broad merits of the case, they would be prepared to consider favourably a proposal to amend the Act. The matter will require careful examination, especially in regard to certain consequential provisions for temporarily filling the places of a high official in India if he is to be allowed to come to this country on leave. I should prefer, therefore, not to embark on a detailed examination unless I felt that I could rely on the support of my colleagues when I am in a position to place the results before them. For their present guidance I may sum up the two sides of the case generally as follows :  Ar gum ants against a change in the law are (1) The misconceptions that might arise in India from a system enabling HisMajesty&apos;s Government to decide great questions by personal consultationwith the Viceroy or the  Commander-in-Chief without any consideredstatement by the Governor-General in Council. (2) The very difficult position of a locum tertens in any of the offices under present conditions.(3) The probability that it would become an established custom to take leave. Arguments in favour of a change in the law are (1) The present veto is a survival from, obsolete conditions, and is not paralleledin any other part of the Empire Overseas. (2) The opportunity of personal consultation between His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the Viceroy and his highest officers would be valuable. (3) The hardships on the officers themselves of being debarred from coming home either in grave illness (except in the case of Executive Councillors) or on the most urgent private affairs without forfeiting office. (4) The possible limitation upon the choice of men appointed from home due tothe provision that they must remain away for five years. (5) The fact that the changes of style introduced in 1919 prevent Pleads of Provinces, often  senior Indian civilians, from taking leave like their predecessors who were called &quot; Lieuteuant-Governors.&quot; My own view, with which the Viceroy concurs, is definitely in favour of the principle of a change in the law, and I trust that my colleagues will be willing to agree that I shall be justified in working out detailed  proposals  for their consideration.PEEL.25th July 1923.SECRET.CP. 295(23).6496     100  7.23
