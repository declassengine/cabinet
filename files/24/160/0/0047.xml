DOOUMSBT IS THB PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAHB1P MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERN^NT.the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation adopted a draft Convention limiting the hours of work in industrial undertakings to eight In the day and forty-eight in the week.   It was expected at the time of the adoption of this draft Convention (November, 1919) that it would be generally ratified by Members of the International Labour Organisation^ but In fact the Convention has not been ratified by any State of first class industrial Importance. 2*   At the last Session of the Governing Body., on the&apos; intervention of the representative of the British workers a Committee was appointed Including a representative.of the British Government &quot;to study the measures likely to favour the ratification of the Convention1^   The Committee meets in Paris on the 2nd June, and I propose to authorise the officer of the Ministry of Labour, who will attend on behalf of the Government, to persist in the attitude detailed in the letter of the 23rd July, 1921 (of which a copy is attached to this memorandum).   That letter was addressed to the-International Labour Organisation on the authority of the late Cabinet -and has guided my action as Government representative and that of others acting in a similar capacity at Geneva on the several occasions since July 1921 on which the question of ratification of the Convention has been raised.

APPENDIX.oofi of letter from Ministry .of Labour to Secretary of Cabinet re Hours of Labour Convention.iiinistry of Labour, Montagu House, b.W.1. I.L. 135/19:31. 53rd July, 1931.Sir,I am directed by the Minister of Labour to refer to tho Draft Convention regulating hours of work in industrial undertakings which was adopted at the first meeting of the General Conference of the international Labour Organisation held at Washington in November, 1919.8c     As you are aware, His Majesty&apos;s Government have, recently had under consideration the possibility of ratifying( this convention, and I am now to request that you will transmit to the Secretary Goneral of the League of Nations the following information.3.     Two principles would appear to be contained in the Convention adopted, first, that the. working hours of persons employed in industrial undertakings shall not exceed f in tho day and if in the week, with certain specified exceptions and secondly that overtime   hours in excess of the daily or weekly maximum are in effect prohibited, with permanent exceptions in tho case of &quot;preparatory or complementary work&quot;P and temporary exceptions 30 that &quot;establishments may deal with exceptional ca3.os of pressure of work&quot;,Thero aro, in the opinion.of Hi3 Majesty&apos;s Government difficulties inherent in the present industrial conditions In this country which prevent the complete aoooptanoo. of these principles as set forth in the Draft Convention.4.&apos;   The first principle, namely, the fixing of a standard maximum normal working week, has already received genoral recognition in the industrial undertakings in the United Kingdom.   By industrial agreements in tho different trades, varying in detail, but with the 3ame purpose, the normal hours of work in almost all industrial undertakings are 48 a week or less.    The systom of a daily maximum of 8 hours is not asoeptod to tho same extent In view of tho universal recognition of tho principle of a half-holiday on Saturday, She extent to   which tho position is covered will be appreciated whan it is stated that it is estimated that from 10 to 12 millions of workpeople in the United Kingdom (about 7C or 80 per cent of the total employed population and praotically the whole of those employed in industrial undertakings, including engineering and shipbuilding, mining, railways, docks, textiles, building and constructions! work) are covered by agreements fixing a normal working week of 48 hours or less,, Although those industrial agreements have not tho forco of law, th&amp;y operate in practice and workpeople in this country have thus obtained by agreement a considerable measure of the protection which tho Draft Convention is designed to secure.
5.     Tho majority of agreements limiting hours of employment also make provision   with respect to overtime, fixing a higher rate of pay e*gc time and a quarter, time and a half,   In general, however, the extent to which overtime may be worked is determined hj the. individual needs of separate establishments subject to agreement between representative organisations of, employers and workpeople in trades concerned.    In the opinion of Hi3 Majestyrs Government, a morl rigid method of limiting overtime, whether by legislation or statute! orders, will not prove so satisfactory as this elastic system of industrial agreement.6.     In addition the convontion applies to the &quot;transport of passengers and goods by rail&quot;.   By two agreemonts, to which the Railway Companies, the Railway Trade Unions and the Ministry of Transport attach great importance, the system adopted on the railway in the United Kingdom is an &amp; hour day and a 4P hour woek, exclusive of the daily overtime, (paid for at. enhanced rates) which is necessa to the efficient working of the railways, and exclusive, in addition of Sunday duty, which falls at regular Intervals,   it does not appeals to His Majesty&apos;s Government that the maintenance of these agreemente would be consistent with the terms of the Draft Convention, and having regard to the views of the parties interested in the agreements, His Majesty1s Government regret that they do not see their way to take steps to abrogate the agreements.7.     In view, therefore, of these difficulties, His Majesty&apos;a Government have no option but to decide that they cannot ratify the Convention.Hi3 Majesty1s Government understand that other countries are experiencing difficulties somewhat similar to tho3o indicated in this communication and they are of opinion that it might be advisable that the whole question should bo&apos;reconsidered at a future conference, the aim of ouch a conference being to adopt a new Hours Convention, retaining those provisions of the Washington Convention which have proved generally acceptable in the light of recent experience, and omitting or modifying those which may appear to be too inelastio for the varying needs of the different industriei in tho respective countries.9.     To this end they propose to suggest to tho Governing Body of the Organisation that it might consider the advisability of placing the question on the Agenda of the General Conference of the Organisation in order that the necessary arrangements for a conferem to deal with the question may be made..10.        I am finally to ask you to convey to the Secretary General of the. League of Nations a declaration on behalf of His Majesty&apos;3 Government that they would be prepared wholo-hoartedly to co-operate in the holding of such a conference, and In tho attempt t( draw up a convention sufficiently elastic to meet with general acceptI am, Sir,Your obodient Servant,(Sgd.)
