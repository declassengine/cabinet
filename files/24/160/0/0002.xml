A national rent strike and means of opposing   cviotions are under consideration.     Thei conference rejeotea the nominal leadership of the Communist Party but decided to affiliate with the Red Internationa of labour Unions.The names of the British communists who have been asked to go to Moscow for the special meeting of the Comintern in May are given in this report!   they include those of J.T. Walton Newbold, M.P., and 3. Saklatvala, M.P.9 0Extracts are given from a report sent to Moscow on the communist organisation of women in Great Britain.
The arrangements for the visit of the Executive of the Communist Party of Groat Britain to Moscow have now been completed:   the Enlarged Session of the Executive of the Communist International is to commence on May 20th and there will be subsequent &quot;private sittings&quot;.     According to present plans the delegates from the British Jlcecutive will be;H. Palme DuttA. 11;;;c.)in Tom BellW. GallacherB. Sviewart H. Pollitta* McMmug (alroads in Moscow).In addition to the Executive the following leadingcommunists have been proposed as delegates:J.T. Walton Hawbold, M.P.8. baklatvala, M.P. (or W. Harming ton)T.A. Jackson (former editor of &quot;TheCommunist&quot;). W. Mellor, (industrial editor of &quot;the daily Herald&quot;).Prior to the departure of the delegates a full Executive meeting is to be held in London on April 28th-29th;   the members at present in the Provinces are to come to London &quot;ell dressed up&quot; and ready for &quot;the great adventure&quot;.The Communist Party has been instructed by the Committee for International Action to make arrangements in this country for an &quot;international campaign&apos;1&apos;1 in connection ?dth the situation in the Ruhr, from April 15th - April. 30th: simultaneous meetings are to be held in the principal centres on April 22nd and the following speakers have been suggested:Birmingham Helen CrawfurdCardiff&apos; T.A. JacksonGlasgow J.T. Walton Hewbold, li,p.Manchester Robert Stewart and/orWilliam Gallacher.In London the communists have secured the use ofTrafalgar/
Trafalgar Square. Weokert has instructed Tom Bell toheve 25,000 copies of the manifesto of the recent Frankfurtconference printed for distribution in Great Britain:   theexpenses will be paid by the &quot;International Committeeagainst War and Fascism,&quot; of which Heakert is secretory.The following report on the work of the &quot;Women&apos;aScotion of the Oonsaunist P;secretary has been drawn up by HelenCrawfurd and forwarded go Moscow:&quot;An attempt was made to carry out instruction of International Pruuensecreturiat re women1s Duy -Glasgow, Liverpool, Edinburgh, Manchester, South Wales, Bradford^ Birmingham  D.P.C. and. several area groups responding.   The general report being, conditions here are ripe for work among women, but we have not the human material to initiate or carry it through.     Prom co-operative sooietiss have coma invitations for women speakers which we have been unable to accept.&quot;The condition in Lundee Jine Workers strike, Agricultural women workers* Glasgow rent evictions^ oalls for assistance from the Paris fa the shape of competent trained women propagandists, or financial facilities for those already in Party to be sent into those areas;&quot;As a praotical step I am already in consultation with Mrs. Horrabln about the formation of a class for the training in the London area of women speakers who could at any rate carry Into labour Party, women1 a sections, Co-operative movement the Communist Party message and who could also in Industrial disputes give assistance.    There are already in Party women like Comrudo Minnie Birch who ought to be freed from technical work.    The interest in the Children&apos;s Eoaies TwV       ,) shown by the Co-operative Women.1 s Guilds being an excellent introduction to the Guild for Cosomunist party women and speakers.&quot;Cosjrwtes like Minnie Birch, Mru. Walicer (London) Lily Webb (south Shields), Sadie span (Glasgow), Mary Soutar (Dundee), Elizabeth Snowden (Bradford), Mrs. E. Brown (Bradford) under direction of National Committee funds permitted, could be sent out or instruoted to initiate work in their respective areas on lines approved of by National Committee,    The sending out of directions is so muoh waste of paper, ink and energy unless we are prepared to follow it up by assistance to initiate where neoessary. &quot;      -------------------
&quot;I very seriously question the value of eviotion resistance so far as the Coraraunist part? is concerned if : O.P. irarabers inside the National Union Unemployed Workers&apos; Corataittee Movement carry it through.   It airqply leads   &apos;   &apos;. them into a blind alley ana the party gains no prestige, although teny of its members may sacrifice much.&quot;For this larger attempt in sending out women comrades finance would need to be spent.   It is ridiculous to attempt it on the amount allocated by Bwwget.   Even to cover railway fares it is insufficient - it would simply pay car fares.   If this is not forthcoming then B.C would be well advised to simply make this a department of party work and through its political bureau issue its instructions to D.P.C. which would carry out same as far as human..material available would permit.&quot;The British Joint labour Aid Committee of the Workers&apos;International Workers Relief which is running the Soviet&quot;Workers&apos; loan&quot; and of which &amp;$ax Whiteheaa is secretaryolaims that agents for the sale of the loan hove&apos; beenappointed by communist groups In the following areas:-ElantyreBlackburnBradfordCardiffCb&amp;pstov?CoventryDev/sburyDundeeHastingsHudder afieldLcecteLiverpoolOldhamPenygamPlymouthRochdaleSa If o rfiShetland.

its quota of the desired circulation of 100,000 by June gOth:   the prise will consist of a special banner presented by the Moscow soviet.The issue of &quot;The workers&apos; Weekly&quot; for April 28th is to be a special May Day ntmiber and groups have been urged to dispose of as many copies as possitle:   it is olsiraea that one  Miners&apos; Lodge in South Wales is to take 1,000 for free distributions)The publishers of the&quot;International Press Correspondence&quot;are complaining bitterly that only about twelve subscriptionshave been taken out for the paper in England:     they have informed the British Coacmnist Party that:-&quot;Considering the high cost of printing and so on, we find It quite impossible to go on spending millions of marks for our English comrades without getting the least return.   In our opinion, theEngllsh Party should do the same as the parties of Prance, Italy, Switzerland, Yugo-slavia, etc., namely take over a certain number of In-Pre-Cor (say about 100-120) and distribute it among the main functionaries...&quot;J. C. Liu, on behalf of the Executive Committee of the Communist International and the Communist Party of China, has requested that literature issued by the Communist Party of Great Britain and the young Communist League may ba sent regularly to Yuan Yuen Chao, National University, Peking, in order that the conmunist movement in China may benefit from the experiences of the Western Parties.The Rev.

Larkin was in possession of several five pound notes.It is reported on the authority of a single Informant that about 30 extremists In the West of Scotland including John McLean, T. linden, Joe Molonald, Bell, and Carlton of Paisley are contemplating the formation of a &quot;Scottish Communist Republican Party&quot;:   a conference is to be held on April   21st and the Party, if formed, will suffer no dictation from Moscow but will be run on former Sinn Fein 1 ine s.m BED INTBRHATIONAL OF LABOUR UNIONSWatkins&apos; complaints regarding the shortage of money for Red International of labour Union work in this oountry have been sent to the Moscow executive by the Central European Bureau which hopes that &quot;it will be possible for you to speak in a few days with a comrade who is well known the whole matter and be able to regulate all questions with you.&quot;The British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions has been asked to send delegates to a conference convened by the&quot;committee for International Propaganda of the revolutionary workers of the Chemical Industry&quot; which will be held,probably in Berlin, at an early date.   Great Britain does not appear to have been represented at the last conference.The/

Thefollowing resolutions were passed:-&quot;This conference of delegates from Trade Organisations declares that the time has now arrived for the organised movement of this Country to take the offensive against the continued attacks of the employing class, by setting up the united front of British Workers.     And knowing that our efforts to stop the onslaught are futile by. sectional,action we hereby declare in favour of all the Workers in Britain preparing immediately to resolve to a general strike to stop the retreat and to reverse the Industrial situation favourably to the workers and declare our determination to participate therein.&quot;&quot;:Ihi s/

Workshop Committees, Trade Union Branches, Working Class Political Parties, Co-operative Societies, Unemployed Organisations, Women&apos;e Guilds and all bonafide Working Class Organisations inthe Trade Councils, which should be re-organised into Industrial Political and Co-operative departments to effect the greatest possible co-ordination of Unity and Act ion.(c) The affiliation of Trades Councils to the Trade Union Congress.(d) The formation of 100$ organised Industrial Unions.(e) The affiliation of the Trade Union Branches, Trades Councils, National Trade Unions and the General Council of the Trade Union Congress to the R.I.L.U.&quot;A Cardiff and District &quot;United Front&quot; conference is tobe held at the Labour Hall, Charles street, Cardiff, on May12th, the arrangements are in the hands of S.

nA few 4aj73 ago we received a report; from Comrade. R. who is at present in Berlin.&quot;In connection with this report we only wish to touch on two points regarfling which expect information from you as soon as possible.I    COLONIAL \jUESTI0H&quot;From Comrade R. report we gather that you are not represented in the Colonial Commission of the Party, that you have been refused a representative.   We remember, however, reading in an earlier report (Minutes) that your request for a representative lud been acoeeded to.   What then is really the case?   We are looking forward to an early answer.   It is our opinion that you should be allowed a representative for it is essential that in this respect Party and league co-operate very olosely.&quot;We have received no information regarding the establishment of a similar commission with your E.C. This should, however, be done without delay, as the matter is really very important.   We refer you to our previous instructions regarding this matter.II    FINANCES&quot;Wo must request ;/qu that this matter be thoroughly investigated.   You should appeal to the Party to appoint a commission to inquire into this matter.   We must insist upon a detailed account being rendered soon.   To this day wo know not what the claims of the Party amount to and what is the basis for their demand for repayment.   As long as neither the Party nor you have given us exact information we cannot give our opinion regarding this matter.   It is really high time for this question to be settled once for all.   Our representative who stayed in Lngland for cuite a time, was never able to get any satisfaction on this point.   We fail to understand why the Party has never ansvsered our letters regarding this matter.&quot;We are simultaneously sending a letter to tho Party with regard to this matter and request you to instruct your representative in the N.B.C. of the Party to insist upon this matter being settled.&quot;All other questions we shall disouas with Comrade R, who will give you a verbal report.&quot;There remains, however, one question which we think it necessary to raise here.   In the March Issue of &quot;The Young Communist&quot; you mention that you have addressed a letter of thanks to some members of the I.1.P, because they objected in Parliament to the contemplated mass export of young unemployed.   80 far so good, although we regret that our representative did. not raise his voice against the proposal.   Regarding the &quot;training centres&quot; we muaii request you to furnish us with mere detailed information regarding the manner in whioh they are intended to function.   It appears to us that the scheme of the Ii.P. (which coincides with that proposed by Bonar law) does not agree with our demand for manual training schools in the shops and factories themselves,but/

If ? 1*W?SHPLOYSXiAbout 120 delegates attended the third national oonforenoe of the&apos; national Unemployed workers&apos; Committee Movement which was held at Coventry on April 9th, loth and 11th.      A preliminary public meeting in the Coliseum Assembly Room on April 8th, which was to have been a &quot;great rally&quot; was very poorly attended, the audienoe of about 150 decreasing to 4Q before the proceedings were finished;   at this meeting Jfriv/iington said that the object of the conference was to perfect the organisation an&apos;  to endeavour to hasten the final clash that must come between the working classes and the capitalist class;   tho movement was therefore definitely revolutionary.The reports given to the conference by national and district offioials indicated that, apart from Scotland, the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement has lost rather than gained ground sinoe November, 1921.but rather proposes vocation sohools after the fashion of the aontinuation schools.   In any dase you must send us the draft of this scheme and supply us with further information.&quot;Regarding the struggle against the pauperisation of the youth, you&quot;.ehould work out concrete proposals with which to ^pnroach the^Y.Ii.1. with a now proposition for a united front (committee of action).&quot;You should furthermore start actions for concrete demands which the parties, trade unions ana unemployed organisations should he asked to support.   You should furthermore address a new Open Letter to the General Trade Union Council.   In this connection we refer you to our previous letters.   Act accordingly by ooncentrating upon certain demands (against emigration;   equal unemployment doles;   establishment of work shop schools;   compulsory reinstatement of unemployed young workers;   all training in those work shop sohools to be regarded as work to be paid for, under the, control of the trade unions).&quot;Report to us soon what you have done and what you intend doing. -\&quot;With communist greetings,8.0* of the Y.CI.&quot;*^Y.L.L. j.

The secretary, Hays, said that the organisation consisted of 271 affiliated and 71 non-affiliated committees:   250 committees were &quot;functioning&quot;.   The rental of the premises at 3, Queen&apos;s Square was  150 a year:   a loan of  20 had been raised to pay the first quarter&apos;8 rent and this had not been repaid.The national organiser, Hannington, reported that:&quot;He had toured Divisions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and had been successful in organising the machinery.   Factory raiding had bo en pushed forward&quot;to a great extent, and had been fairly successful.   Unfortunately this tactic was not used to the same extent at the present time, in December 1921, 17 factories were raidea in London, 2 outstanding ones were Ediswan and A.B.C. London had given the lead, but unfortunately other parts of the country had not. responded as they should have done.   Divisional Organisers had failed to report at regular intervals as had been requested.   From September 22nd last up to February 23rd his whole time was occupied with the fictional March, which had been very successful, which he hoped would be continued. There has been no great increase in the scales of relief since the last conference, at the present there is a tendency to relapse.     Guardians and Council elections: many branches had been successful in returning Unemployed dandidates, v&amp;ere such candidates wore put up, whole hearted support was given to Labour Candidates.   Out of large numbsrs of class-war prisoners who have been sent down bv far the majority were members of the organisation.

On this occasion Mr. Andrew McLaren, M.P., expressed regret that &quot;such an important resolution&quot; dhould be carried at a moment&apos;s notice &quot;&quot;dthout deep consideration&quot;.The Scottish division of the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement has asked the Scottish Trades Union Congress to receive a deputation at the Dundee Congress:   the request is to be considered by the Standing Orders Committee.On April 12th about 150 unemployed who had met in an outbuilding of the Central Wosleyan Mission H-v.ll, went in small groups to the North Middlesex Hospital, pushed an attendant aside and obtained access through the hospital grounds to the Edmonton Union:   they rushed into the dining hall and wore eventually given a meal of bread and cheese and coffee:   l.he demonstration was a protest against the outs in the scale of out-relief recently made by the Edmonton Guardians, and a sequel to e deputation to Tottenham Police Court on the previous day,when /
- u -whan the Magistrate, asked to grant an order for admission to the Wo::khouse, referred the men to the Clerk to tho Guardians. The ccmmunist, george Measures, is the ringleader in this area.The Chief Constable informs me that communists are particularly active in connection with the unemployed in Duncieo:   on April 10th a deputation which included Robert Stewart demanded increased relief from the Parish Council: the demand was refused and a crowd of about 5,000 marched away in different directions, showing resentment and breaking two shop windows.    Tho Chief constable has notified Stewart and other leaders that such processions oannot be allowed in future.IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES Iff GREAT BE IT A IKAs far as the Eapubiica.n.,elament in this country isconcerned there is little to raport:   the movement is atpresent entirely disorganised.The raid made last week on the homes of people known to be connected with the Irish Republican /any w. s intended to convey to the persons concerned, who are mostly boys, that their activities are known and was not expected to produce much tangible result.&quot;0&apos;C. Britain&quot; has not been heard of since his last visit to Glasgow.The publicity arising from the previous raid has caused Irishmen of moderate opinions to think chat the time has come for them to take a hand in affairs and they are considering the possibility of starting a sporting and social movement similar to the Scottish and Welsh National Booieties.   These men are influenced also by the progress of events in Ireland end admit that the Republican cause is lost:   d.e Valera&apos;2 last proclamation, a copy of which is appended to thisreport/
report, has fatten very flat.Countess tt.xfc.ia vies is still in Glcs^ow:   her lectures have been a financial failure and the Republican novement in Scotland generally is very short of money, the Ja&amp;ee Connoll Club having a balance of 5/9d.Henderson, managing editor and. P.J. little, the chief publicity agent of &quot;Eire&quot;, are in Manchester, which they intend to make their headquarters as their position ia Glasgow had become uncomfortable.
4 appendix DAILY BULLETINNo. 165 Friday April 13th  Eighth year of the Republic.PRESIDENT&apos;S ADDRESS TO THE ARMYApril 20th, 1923.SOLDIERS CP TPS REPlJBLIO, bulwark of our nation&apos;b honour and Independence; as you mourn in spirit to-day at the bier of your comrade and your chief - the lion heart, whose exalted soul and tenacious will aided by our &quot;royal allies the hills&quot;, more than any other baffled the forces of an Errnira and brought them to terms - you will renew your pledges of devotion to the cause for whioh he gave his young life and beg that the Go  of Liberty and Truth rvy inspire and strengthen you to be faithful everyone similarly unto death.Ifc-ioed, in arras by former comrades, who have deserted from your side, your task is a hard one and a sad.   It is a task which only heroes would venture   *   You have to fling yourself across the path of the stamps fie of a nation.But it is better to die nobly as your Chief has died than to live a slave.Your oause is immortal.   Weariness from the exacting struggle, fj4.se teachers,,  ten^temporary losses and defeats way defer, but cannot prevail against its ultimate triumph.   The sacrifices you are making will ensure it, and they, who in ignorance calumniate you to-day will to-morrow do you honour.When Euanofa epitwph can be written, coupled with his loved name will be those who gave their lives now that Ireland may not be false to herself.(Signed)    Bamon de VALEBA.
