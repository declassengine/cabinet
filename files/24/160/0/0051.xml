During the week the communists have devotedx______ ..... :ab&quot;question hut although numerous meetings have been held under the auspices of the Party little progress has been made with the formation of Councils of action.     There is moreover little indication that, apart from sharing a platform at a public meeting, labour and trade union officials are, at present, prepared to join forces with communists on these councils.The Glasgow District Communist Party Committee has circulated a draft resolution to members with instructions to bring it before trade union branches and urges also that a cablegram in the following form should be sent to &quot;The Trade Union House, Moscow&quot;:-.&quot;No._Branch_Pledges full support to Russian Workers in this crisis.&quot;The Executive Committee of the Communist Internationalis making great efforts to influence British Labouragainst a rupture of the Trade Agreement!   its mediumis, generally speaking, the Communist Party but on May 19ththe &quot;Committee of Action against War Danger and Fascism&quot;addressed a manifesto to the International SocialistCongress at Hamburg from which the following passagesare taken:&quot;The note of Lord curzon to the Soviet G overrent proves that the English Government fleairae a breach with Soviet ktj?e.i.a.    If it were net so it would not address the Government of a great people in a mender which, ae the &apos; Daily Herald&apos; aptly said, calls to mine the Austrian note to  atvia vi-hich led tc war Sv. 1214.     The Soviet Government,, in order to preserve peace has sat aside all question of political prestige.   It has not only complied with the immediate and pressingdemands/
aomands of the British government, but it has declared itself ready to settle all difference through an Anglo-Russi an conference.&quot;The conservative British Government however, refuses to negotiate with the first proletarian Government on the footing of equality of rights.   Lord Curzon has granted an extension of the period of the ultimatum, &quot;but the ultimatum remains.   Loci Curzon is waiting for the moment when parliament having risen he will have a free hand to bring about a breach. - Such a bre-ach will moan nothing less&quot; than a fresh intervention against Soviet Russia.....lord Curaon and the British Foreign Office consciously deceive the English proletariat end English public opinion v:;hen, through the mouth of their parliamentary representative Ronald McNeill they assart that the breaking off of the trade relations does not mean war...     Soviet Russia is only divided from British territory by a narrow frontier, and this rouses the hatred of British imperialism.   The adventurers of world counter-revolution will therefore see to it that a guerilla war on the frontiers of Russia begins which will Isad to a new war...&quot;We appeal to the British Labour Party at once to arrange powerful demonstrations against the breaking off of relations with Soviet Riissia.   The Bullish working class form the great majority of the population;   if they do not wish it, then no British Junker end no British militarist will venture to proclaim war on the Russian Workers&apos; and Peasant&apos;s state...&quot;Those delegates who could be intercepted on their journey to Moscow, including Tom Bell who had reached Berlin, have been ordered to return to this country presumably on account of the Anglo-Russian situation:   Bell landed at Harwich on May 18th in company with Arthur MeManus, who stated that he had been to Moscow for a fortnight, whereas he had actually been there for several months.   Since his arrival Bell has stated that a special meeting.of the Political Bureau is to be held in order to arrange &quot;still more energetic efforts&quot; against a rupture with Russia.Local organisations of the Communist Party have been informed that, according to a decision reached by the Central Executive of the Communist International in December 1922, each national Communist Party is now &quot;under an obligation toimpose/.

The headings fox the information required by headquarters cover, in type, six foolscap pages3    the main points in what is virtually a questionnaire are:     &quot;membership, aggregate meetings, area groups, group leaders committee, party training, public meetings and demonstrations, tirade unions, co-operatives, trades/council, Local Labour Party, Local Government Bodies, unemployed organisation , literature distribution, leaflet distribution, work among women, Young Coraraunist League, financial report.&quot;A Party Oommitteej of whioh W. MoLaine is acting as seoretary, has been set up at Sing Street to organise communist forces within the Amalgamated Engineering Union:   local Groups have been instructed to set up committees on the same lines and to forward all names of Amalgamated 3ngineering Union members to Headquarters.   The communist programme has been accepted by the Sheffield Amalgamated Engineering Union    District Committee and by several Amalgamated Engineering Union branches in Sheffield.The Executive Committee of the International Oriental Seafarers&apos; Union sent the political secretary of the Communist Party an urgent invitation to attend its meeting on May 20th and   also   asked for a communist speaker to address a mass meeting In Poplar Town Hall on June 1st.   The agenda on May 20th included discussion of the report made bythe/
** 4 o*300the deputation which visited Liverpool to enquire into the Btrljjs of  coloured seamen in April, organisation of a centre in Cardiff, draft of a programme for propaganda among Chinese, Japanese and other oriental seamen and consideration of a proposal to share a hall for office and other purposes et Camming Town with the Red International of Labour Unions t-nd the workers&apos; solidarity League.The Glasgow District Party doom is tee is at loggerheads with the national Bite executive whioh it accuses of &quot;diluted and emasculated centralism&quot;,   the Exeoutive has brought counter-charges of negligence and is supported hy the business manager who has forwarded to the Scottish organiser details of the outstanding literature accounts amounting to  358.4.8. which Glasgow is requested to pay.MS YORQYBKY MURDERa special supplement to the &quot;International Press Correspondence&quot; has been issued in connection with the murder of Vorovsky:   it consists of a statement by ginoviev and a manifesto of the Executive Committee of the Third International and of the Hod International of Labour Unions:   she latter lays the responsibility for the murder of Vorovsky at the door of the British Government,In his statement zinoviev declares that:-&quot;Thc Entente murderers have aimed truly.-   They have robbed our party and the international labour movement of an outstanding personality,.,&quot;Tho responsibility for the bloody Seed lieB not only with the leader of Swiss Fascism and the handful of petty bourgeois who stand at the head of the celebrated &quot;democratic1 Swiss republic.   The political responsibility for this unheard of crime is to he borne, before all, by the Entente Governments, the so-called &apos;inviting&apos; Powers who are the stage managers and masters of the Lausanne Coaiareuvce.&quot;The shooting of comrade VorovBky oocured at a time of excitement.   The &quot;Die Hard&apos; cootion of theEnglish/
* 5 &quot;*301English Imperialists are moving heaven and earth in order to plunge Europe into the abyss of a new war.   All these are links in one chain:   the Ruhr, the triumphal journey of General Foch, the ultimatum of Curzon to Soviet Russia, tho murder of Comrade Vorovsky and the incredibly insolent attitude of the polish bourgeoisie, the growth of international Fascism, the furious onslaught of Capital...&quot; ?&apos;The manifesto contains, inter alia, the following yassagos:-&quot;10 THE WORKERS OF ALL COUNTRIES.&apos;&quot;Comrade Vorovsky, the fully empowered representative of Russia at Lausanne, has been murdered by a Swiss accomplice of the Entente.   The diplomatic organizers of the Lausanne conference have not murdered him themselves, they did not openly plan hie murder.   They did it with all the secret arts of diplomacy.   They first caused the Fascist poison to be spread by the reactionary capitalist press against the Russian representative, and then the blood hounds from the Swiss &quot;National league  were let loose on his track.&quot;It is evident that even after the publicly expressed threat of the Fascist demonstrators before the residence of the Russian representative, the powerful organizers of the Lausanne conference could have prevented this infamour murder with a single word. It is, however, equally evident that a single secret gesture on their part sufficed to bring about the realisation of the threat...&quot;The Dardanelles are...the key to the freedom of the peoples of Asia, and Soviet Russia is the only great power which defends this key of their freedom from robbery.   The shot at the representative of Russia in Lausanne was also aimed at the national future, at the movement for emancipation Of the peoples of Asia. It was accurately aimed.   The chief instigator of this assassination, Lord Curzon, has at the same time in his note to Soviet Russia set forth the meaning of this shooting.   According to his opinion, the interests of British robbery were everywhere injured by Soviet Russia.;   liberty of movement was not once granted to the spies of the Entente in Moscow and the interests of the English warships were neither recognised in the White nor in the Black Sea-   But the demands of Lord Curson go still further:   Soviet Russia must retain no representative in Persia and Afghanistan who recognizes tho right of the Asiatic peoples to national independence.    In India, no fighters for the freedom of the people, and no friends of soviet Russia are to be allo?/ed to live, but only colonial slaves.     And the Coiraunist International in its propaganda shall not support the movement for emancipation of the toiling masses of India or Egypt.   Thus demanded Lord Curson, and the act of hiB accomplice in Lausanne was thelogical/
IPlogical Interpretation of his demand.   The British Government could not have unmasked Itself better. Like a lightning flash, tho shot in Lausanne has lit up the situation for all the exploited peoples of Asia, Such a propaganda deed will certainly contribute far more to the revolutionizing of Asia than the Communist International could have accomplished in a year.&quot;The shot in Lausanne was, however, not only aimed at the freedom of the peoples of Asia...     Fighting comrades of all countries, at you it was directed,at the first outposts of your international fighting front...&quot;This bloody challenge should not remain unanswered by you.   You should answer with the firm consolidation of your fighting ranks, with the enhancement of all your forces in the class war, with the consolidation of your revolutionary alliance with the victorious Russian proletariat and with the hundreds of millions of oppressed and enslaved peoples of Asia...&quot;down with the imperialist assassins.&apos;   Down with the Fascist bloodhounds!&quot;Up wLth the victorious revolutionary proletariat! Up with the proletarian world revolution!&quot;Moscow, May 14th, 1983.The Executive Committee of the Communist International.G. Zinoviev. W. Kolarov.The Executive Committee of the Red International Of Labour Unions.A. Lozovaky,&quot;THE RED INTERNATIONAL OF LABOUR UNIONSThe Red International of Labour Unions oonference in Moscow has been postponed until June 10th:   J.R. Campbell, editor of &quot;The Worker&quot;, is to be one of the delegates and Watkins, the organising secretary of the British Bureau, has been instructed to &quot;prepare a financial statement for headquarters.&quot;The following extract, taken from a communication dated May 12th and written by Hermann on behalf of the mid-European/
aid-European Bureau of the Rod International of labourUnions is another example of the interest taken by the bureau in the proceedings of British Trade Unions&quot;On March. 19th m wrote to you, concerning a resolution adopted by the London branch of the Post and Office Workers&apos; Union in favour of admission of the All-Sunsian Union to the International Federation of Postal Workers, and asked for further -information on this matter.&quot;As we learn from the Daily Herald now, the Annual Conferonoe of the Post and Office Workers has beer held in the nvsanvim?, and the motion of the London branch has only been rejected by a majority of 534 as against 338.   The   General Seoretary Bowan himself has spoken in favour of admission of the Russian Union adoording to the press news.&quot;You will understand, that it Is of greatest importance for the International Propaganda committee of Postal Workers to get immediately into touch with this eeeadngly rather strong opposition-group among the English Postal Workers, and to co-ordinate its efforts with those made in the same direction else-where.&quot;We therefore repeat our demand to send us further information on this matter if possible, and at any rate to inform us of the name and address of a communist comrade belonging to this opposition group...*f&quot;The International Propaganda Committee of the printing and Kindred Trades&quot; in Moscow has instructed the british bureau of the Red International of labour unions to send itregularly oopies Of &quot;The British Printer&quot;, &quot;The ScottishTypographical Journal&quot;, &quot;The Typographical circular&quot;, &quot;TheLondon Typographical Journal&quot; and &quot;The Hatsopa Journal&quot;.convictions on May 19th two Hungarian political refugees named Stefan Kovesi and Geza Fritz, charged with landing in this oountry without permission of the Immigration Authorities, were each sentenced to six raonths*- hard labour and recommended for deportation:   the men deserted from the Hungarian S.S. &quot;Haros&quot; on April 22nd and during their stay in/
n* 3 **in London were in olose touch with various cojununists and with Taylor of Arcos,with whose help they intended to smuggle out of this country to Russia.   The men were arrested while in the house of two British communists, William and Dora savage, against whom summonses have been granted under Sections 8 (2) aod 18 (2) of the Aliens Order 1920.fH8 PHBMPLOYEDThe London District Couacil of the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement intends to hold a demonstration in Trafalgar Square on May 2 7th at which speakers will deal with the Russian question and the Irish deportations as well as with questions of unemployment.The unemployed continue to display particular activity in the West of Scotland,   a typical procession and mass meeting were held at Alexandria on May 18th at which the Chief Con stab lee of Dunbartonshire informs me thut about 1,000 people were present:   the speakers included Saunders&quot;, McShane, Aitken Ferguson, Murray and Thomas Griffen:   a deputation was subsequently received by the Parish Council regarding the relief scale:   later the police arrested a Renton communist for being drunk and disorderly but were only able to get him to the police office with great difficulty oy;ing to the ugly attitude of the crowd.The Chief Constable of Sal ford informs me that the Communist Party has issued instructions to Local Party Committees to arrange hunger marches during the gap periods in unemployment benefit:   the routes are to be chosen by local committees and to be kept secret.jjsg REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAINThe mild excitement caused by the return of the Deportees having subsided, events in Irish Republicanquarters/
quarters here are resuming their normal course,   oatio olft Executive, with the exception of Art 0&apos;Brien and Sean McGrath,! have resumed oontrol with a certain air of optimism which they are far from feeling.    Among the minor lights feeling is somewhat mixed;   they are all talking of the amount they are to receive as compensation, sums from  500 to  1,000 being mentioned.Some of Art 0&apos;Brien&apos;s followers, waiting to scolaim him outside the law Courts, were greatly upset at his re-arrest: afterwards a&quot;council of War&quot;was held at 3, Adam street, and it transpired that O&apos;Brien&apos;6 own idea was to get away quietly after his release and stay in hiding for a time, leaving his legal advisers to fight the matter out on his behalf.At a &quot;demonstration in honour&quot; organised by the Irish Da If-Determination league, in the vicinity of Brixton Prison on the evening of jj^y 20th, only about 100 persons, including sightseers, were present.   The speakers were J.H. fowler (Acting President of the I.S.B.L.), Brian 0&apos;Hannigan (Secretary of the Prisoners&apos; Defence fund), and S. Sakletvala, M.P.Saklatvala contended that Art 0&apos;Brien, by his action, had proved himself a great champion of justice and had in coneequence saved the British Htiion from the appalling results which would have accrued from the mistaken policy of March 11th last.  0&apos;Hannigan made an appeal for a collection on behalf of the &quot;Victims&quot; but this met with a poor response.Saklatvala also made a brief speech at a &quot;Grand Dance&quot; at the Borough Hall, Greenwich, on May 19th, in aid of the Irish Republican Prisoners&apos; Dependents fund.   About 200 persona, nearly all youths and young girls, were present.   He congratulated them on the victory the Irish Deportees had won over a stupid government, and said the Irish Republicans,like/
lite the Indian nationalists, were engaged In no conspiracy,cufl had no need to do so.   The victory would he won if theystuck together, determined to achieve freedom.   There was nohalf-way house where freedom was concerned, either complete freedom was won or the people remained oppressed.   He went onto aclvwats oommunistio methods but evoked no enthusiasmamong his audience.The :,0atholic Herald&quot;,in its latest edition, afterwelcoming the decision of the Court of Appeal with regard tothe Deportees, says:&quot;It is unlikely that any of them will, give any further trouble to the Free State.   To begin with they are sreli watched, and in the second place the Irreprlax Organisation in Ireland has considerably crumpled up since their arrest,&quot;With regard to events in Ireland, the general opinion here is that the Republicans have offered peace too late to be of any use, from their point of view:   both politically and morally they were bankrupt and had nothing with which to bargain.Irish labour seems to be settling down; the leaders do not appreciate the tactics of the ultra-Republicans, and see thftir best chance in some form of ordered government. While loudly proclaiming their adherence to James Connolly&apos;3 programme, none of them seems to be anxious to follow in his footsteps. harkin7s abandonment of the policy of physical force is having its effect.
