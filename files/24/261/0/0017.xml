THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1936.Copy  No.CABINET.PALESTINE.    .             ESTABLISHMENT OF A LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL.            Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    I HAVE just heard that the Labour Opposition have given notice that they intend to raise, on the occasion of the  debate on the Consolidated Fund Bill inthe House  of Commons on  Thursday, the 26th March, the  question  of  HisMajesty&apos;s Governments proposal to establish a  Legislative Council in Palestine.    2.  As my colleagues are aware, this question  has  been before the Cabineton numerous occasions in recent years.  For convenience, I give the  followingbrief  resume of the history of the proposal :     (i) A scheme for the establishment of  a Legislative Council  was originallyput forward in 1922, but had to be  abandoned on account of the opposition ofthe Arab parties in Palestine. In 1930, the Labour Government announced their intention of proceeding with the establishment of a Legislative Council.  In April1932 the then Cabinet decided on the following  line  of policy (vide CP. 132  (32)and Conclusions 24 (32)) :     (1) The pledge of  His Majesty&apos;?  Government that a  Legislative. Council           should be established must stand.    (2) We should, if possible,  both here  and in Palestine avoid  any definite           statement on  the  subject  until the Mandates Commission  met later           in the year.    (3) In  the meantime,  the High Commissioner should try  to secure  the           co-operation  of  Jews  and Arabs on various Advisory Boards,  and           appoint some Palestinian members  to the Advisory Council  during           1932.    (4) The High Commissioner should proceed with the necessary measures for           the reorganisation of the Local Authorities and elections to these           organised bodies should be carried out.    (ii) In November  1932, with  the  approval  of  the   Government here,Sir Arthur  Wauchope, the High  Commissioner,  informed  the  permanent mandates  Commission  at  Geneva  that the Governments intention was  toestablish a Legislative  Council,  and that  steps would be  taken  towards itsformation  when  the  new  Local Government  Ordinance, which was then  in preparation, had been brought into working order.    (iii) The position as it then stood was explained by Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister(now  Lord  Swinton) to the  Cabinet in CP.  374  (32).  The Cabinet approved thepolicy set forth in that paper (Conclusions 60 (32)), viz.,  if both Jews and Arabsrejected  the Government proposals, Government might  find  themselves in  aposition in which  they had done their best to fulfil their pledge, but  in whichfulfilment was practically impossible. That might discharge  Government for thetime being  from their obligations and throw them back  on continuing to govern the country as at present. But one thing was clear Government must not allowone party alone to prevent indefinitely the establishment  of a  Legislative council by a refusal to co-operate.       [12941]SECRET.CP. 87 (36).
     (iv)  In November 1934 the Cabinet approved, in principle, specific proposals submitted by Lord Swinton for setting up a Legislative  Council  (CP. 256  (34)and  Conclusions 43 (34)).     (v) In February 193S the Cabinet took note of a memorandum circulated byLord Swinton covering his despatch  to the High Commissioner setting out theproposals approved by  Cabinet and  the High Commissioners reply, which he regarded as satisfactory (CP. 25 (35) and Conclusions 8 (35)).     (vi)  In January of this  year, I circulated (CP. 2 (36)) a memorandum tothe Cabinet giving an account of the steps taken towards setting up a LegislativeCouncil  since the  matter last came before them, together with an appreciation of the position.  I made it clear that  the commitments of  His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment were such that  it was  now impossible to reconsider the matter; nor  was further delay practicable.  Sir Arthur Wauchope, I said,  would find his positionimpossible (i.e., if Government were  to yield  to the Jewish opposition).   with full  authority from His Majesty5s Government Sir Arthur Wauchope had givenundertakings which he could not go back on.   If, as a result of the discussions in Palestine, it should emerge that the Arabs  generally changed their ground and  indicated that they, like the Jews, though  for other reasons, did not wish theproposal for a Legislative Council to  be pursued, the position would be different.     (vii) The Cabinet agreed (Conclusions 1  (36)) to certain  specific proposalswhich had been made  by me, on two points in connection with the  LegislativeCouncil, i.e., there was no suggestion  of going back on the policy of setting up a legislative Council.     3.  A despatch has just  been received  from Sir Arthur Wauchope  giving his final report on the local reception  of Governments proposals.  He is satisfiedthat  the general  trend of Arab opinion is setting  steadily  in  favour  of  theestablishment of a Legislative Council, and he sees no reason to  revise the opinionalready  given  that, if no unforeseen or extraneous factors  arise,  the  greatmajority of the Arab population will  be prepared to co-operate with Governmentin the establishment and working of the Council.     4.  Suggestions that, in view of the strongly expressed hostility of Jewishopinion  in  this country, in  Palestine, and  indeed throughout the  world,  theproposals should not be proceeded with or that they should be delayed, e.g., by setting up a Eoyal Commission to enquire into the whole question, received noencouragement from Lord Plymouth in the House of Lords, and on the 11th MarchI stated in the House of Commons  that I did  not feel that the appointmentof a  Commission to enquire into the  constitutional problem in Palestine would now be justified.   In answer to a Supplementary Question, I agreed that if sucha  Commission  were set up,   it would undoubtedly be regarded  as  absolutelycontrary to every pledge given by Government in the matter of the Council.     5.  I fully realise the strength of the Jewish opposition to these proposals,and  I can understand, and to some extent sympathise with, their attitude,  butsuccessive Governments,  including, as I have shown, the Labour Government of1929-31, have fully committed themselves to the policy, and I feel that it is quite impossible to draw back.     I may say that in a recent  private communication which I  have receivedfrom Sir Arthur Wauchope  he gives me his considered opinion that if Govern-ment proposals for a Legislative Council were not carried through this would leadto most unfortunate results, and he feels it his duty to advise me that there wouldhe almost certainly civil disobedience and disturbances, particularly in view of the apparent success achieved by disorder  in Syria and by student rioting in Egypt.     6.  I thought it necessary to inform my colleagues of the present situationso that there might be no misunderstanding in the matter, and I now ask for  thefinal  endorsement  by the Cabinet of the policy of proceeding with the establish-ment of a Legislative Council on the lines already approved.Colonial Office, Downing  Street,       March 21, 1936.(Initialled)       J.
