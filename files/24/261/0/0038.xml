THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET.n.P.108(36).COPY NO.CABINET..TRADE MARKS BILL.Memorandum by the President of the Board               of Trade.     I should be glad to have authority for the immediatepreparation of a Bill to give legislative effect to therecommendations of the Committee which sat under theChairmanship of Viscount Goschen on the Law and Practicerelating to Trade Marks, whose unanimous report, dated20th April, 1934, was published as Cmd. 4568.     The recommendations are of considerable importance totrade and industry.  Amongst the more important are -     (a) A new provision in regard to the assignment of a   Trade Mark without the goodwill of the business concerned.   A decision recently taken in the Court of Appeal has   probably invalidated many existing assignments and the   assignees are prevented from protecting their Marks   against piracy.   Moreover rearrangements of businesses   involving a distribution of Trade Marks are rendered   difficult.  The present situation has given rise to a   state of uncertainty to which an end should be put as soon   as possible.     (b) Provision under safeguards for the use of one   another&apos;s Trade Marks by associated companies and firms.   The lack of such a provision hampers business.     (c) The removal of certain requirements in regard to   Trade Mark registration which put British exporters at a   disadvantage with their foreign competitors in overseas   markets.-1-
Board  of Trade,    9th April,  1936.      (d) To afford protection for the owners of valuable   Trade Marks against forms of user which enable   unscrupulous competitors to exploit the goodwill of the   Trade Mark in favour of their own products.     The recommendations of the Committee have  met withgeneral approval in trade circles, and a deputation urging the importance Of early legislation to give effect to them was recently received at the Board of Trade.  The deputationrepresented the Federation of British Industries, the TradeMarks, Patents and Designs Federation Limited,  a jointCommittee representing a number of important  chemicalinstitutions, the London,  Manchester and Birmingham chambers of Commerce, the Chartered Institute of Patent  Agents, theBritish Group of the International Association  for theProtection of Industrial Property, and the British standards institution.     I ask for authority for the preparation  of the bill and for its submission to  the Home Affairs Committee as soonas it is drafted.   It would be suitable for introduction in the House of Lords.   So far as I can judge,  the bill will he non-controversial.                                      W.K.
