THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1936.1SECRET.Copy  No.CP. 73  (36).CABINET.GERMANY  AND THE LOCARNO TREATY.MEMORANDUMM  BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.I. The German Memorandum of March 7.     THE German memorandum of the 7th March raises three issues :      (a) The  legal justification attempted by the German Government for the           denunciation of the Treaty of Locarno.     (&amp;) The reoccupation of the demilitarised zone.     (c) The  settlement  which the German  Government offers  in place  of the           Locarno Treaty and the demilitarisation of the Rhineland.(a) A ttempted legal justification for German action.     2.  The  German argument justifying  their denunciation  of the locarno treaty is that the Franco-Soviet Pact is incompatible with that treaty.  In the correspondence which took place last  summer, His Majesty&apos;s Government, as wellas the Italian and Belgian Governments, expressed agreement with the view ofthe French Government  that no such incompatibility existed.  But, whatever thevalue of the German arguments, they cannot justify their unilateral denunciation of Locarno.  The difference of opinion on this point between France and germany was clearly a question which Germany  was bound to settle in  accordance with article 3 of Locarno and the Franco-German Arbitration Convention a course which M. Flandin had already intimated his willingness to adopt.  The  germans have  purported  to decide themselves  a question which they  were  bound  toarbitrate, thereby  violating their Locarno  obligations,  and have  based theirdenunciation of Locarno  on this unilateral decision.(b) Reoccupation of Demilitarised Zone.     3.  As regards the reoccupation of the Rhineland, it  is relevant to recall here that the  possibility of negotiations between the Locarno Powers,  which  mighthave culminated in  authorising its reoccupation by Germany, was  already underconsideration  in   London.   A   memorandum   which   I  circulated  on  the14th February, 1936 (G.  (36) 3),  states that  &quot; taking one thing  with another, itseems undesirable to adopt an attitude where we would either have to fight for the zone or abandon it in the face of a German  reoccupation.  It will be preferable for Great Britain and France to enter betimes into negotiations with the GermanGovernment for the surrender, on conditions, of our rights in the zone.&quot;  Anda Foreign Office memorandum on the Air Pact, prepared in consultation  with theAir Ministry and War  Office (G. (36) 4 of the 2nd March,  1936),  expresslyenvisages the possibility  that if we pressed  the German Government to discussthe Air  Pact they  &quot; would  reply that they will  raise the question of thecontinuance of the demilitarised zone; but in many respects such a reply might beto the good.&quot;  Indeed,  in the communication  which I  made  to the  german ambassador  on  the  6th  March  (Foreign  Office despatch  No.  296 of  the6th March) I had this possibility very  definitely in mind, though,, of course, no indication of the kind was given to Herr von Hoesch.[12855]B
     4.  The German Government, by the inoccupation of the zone effected on the morning of the 7th March, have thus not by that action produced a result, so far as  the demilitarised zone itself is concerned, which  we were not prepared ultimately to contemplate.  It is the manner of their action, as I informed the German Ambassador yesterday, which  we  deplore.  Herr Hitler might  have demanded arbitration as  to the compatibility of the Franco-Soviet Treaty  with Locarno and awaited the result.  This  would have  been  the  right course  and, indeed, M. Flandin had already offered to follow it.  He might have declared  him- self no longer  bound by  Locarno, and asked for negotiations to  replace it by another treaty  without  the demilitarised zone provision.   This would have  been plausible, although contrary to the terms of the treaty.  He has chosen, however, to eliminate all negotiations by reoccupying the zone at once.   It is this which  is so highly provocative and puts Herr Hitler  entirely in the wrong.   He has evidently taken this extreme course (vide Berlin telegrams Nos.  51 and 54) against military advice  and under the  pressure  of  General Goring and  the Nazi extremists. Among his motives was probably the fact that he  wished to act  before British rearmament brought renewed confidence to the  French and increased vigour to the League.  He may also have wished to act while Italy was still at issue with the League and with  her  Locarno partners.     5.  Herr Hitler&apos;s action is alarming because of the fresh confirmation which it affords of the scant respect  paid  by German Governments to the sanctity of treaties.  Moreover, he  has complicated the negotiations.   For by reoccupying the Rhineland he has deprived us of the possibility of making to him a concession which might otherwise have been a useful bargaining counter in our hands in the general negotiations with Germany which we had it in contemplation to initiate. Such negotiations are now inevitable, but we shall enter them at a disadvantage, for we have lost the bargaining counter to which I have just referred.   Further, we shall have the utmost difficulty in persuading other European Powers to enter into fresh treaties which  must obviously depend for their  value on the reliance which  can  be  placed on Germany&apos;s promises.   This difficulty will  become particularly apparent in regard to the readmission of Germany to  the League of Nations (see paragraph  13). (c)  German Suggestions for Future.    6.   The &quot; system of peaceful  security for  Europe &quot; which the German Government propose in the place of  the Locarno Treaty and  the demilitarised zone may now be considered.    7.   The first suggestion  is that  the German Government should negotiate with France and Belgium for the  &quot; creation of a zone demilitarised on both sides .... on conditions of complete equality.&quot;  This, of course, is impracticable so far at least  as any immediate future  is concerned; and may be dismissed atonce as made for propaganda purposes only.  France has spent at least  40 million on the  fortification of her north-eastern frontier  and Belgium has also spent large sums.  These fortifications allow of no space  for a zone on the French  and Belgian side of  the frontier.   It is impossible to suggest that France and Belgiumcould consider  the scrapping of their fortifications in exchange for a German promise, in which no  confidence could be placed, that the German demilitarised zone would be observed.    8.   Points 2, 3, 4 and  5 of the German suggestions may perhaps be considered together.  This proposal is for a non-aggression pact between Germany,  France and Belgium (duration twenty-five years), guaranteed by Britain and Italy,  andto which the Netherlands should also be a party if that country and  the other contracting Powers so desired.  This system is to be strengthened by  an  air pact &quot; calculated to prevent the danger  of sudden  air attacks in  an automaticand effective manner.&quot;    9.   This proposal may be said  to coincide generally  with our desiderata, though  the  participation  of the  Netherlands of course  raises  issues on which we ourselves are still undecided.  The latest pronouncement on the  subject is the report  of  the  Chiefs of Staffs, dated  the 20th  November  last D.P.R.  48 (C.O.S.  413).
     10.  One would hope that the reference to an air pact, which would &quot; prevent. the danger of  sudden air attacks in an automatic and effective manner,&quot; would make  it  possible to  include  the bilateral arrangements  to  which the French Government attach so much importance.     11.  In point 6 the German Government &quot; repeat the offer to conclude with the States bordering Germany in the East non-aggression pacts similarly as with Poland &apos;&apos;;  and Lithuania  is  now included  &apos;&apos; on condition that the guaranteed autonomy of the Statute  of Memel  is  effectively developed.&quot;   It is not  clear whether this means the maintenance of  the present statute or the grant of  some further measure of autonomy.     12.  The  German &quot;offer&quot;  of non-aggression pacts dates  from  the winter of 1933 to 1934, and was finally defined in Herr Hitler&apos;s speech of the 21st May, 1935, in which he said that &quot; the German Government are ready on principle to conclude  pacts of non-aggression with their various  neighbouring States.&quot;  At that time Lithuania was specifically excluded because of the situation in MemeL As a matter of fact, the only States bordering on Germany, even if &quot; in the East &quot; is  interpreted  in the widest possible way,  are Lithuania, Poland (which already has a non-aggression treaty for ten years), Czechoslovakia and Austria.  But it is not at all clear whether this offer applies to Czechoslovakia and Austria.   All that can be said is that at one time Germany was willing to give Czechoslovakia a non-aggression treaty and offered it to her.  As  regards Austria, it may be recalled that  in his  speech of  the 21st  May, i935, Herr Hitler stated  that &quot; Germany neither intends nor  wishes to interfere  in the domestic affairs of Austria, to annex Austria, or to  attach that country to her.&quot;     13.  Point 7 declares Germany&apos;s readiness to re-enter the League of Nations. It   would  be   rash   to  underestimate  the difficulties  connected  with   her readmittance.  Re-election  to the League  requires a  two-thircls majority of the Assembly, while a permanent seat on the  Council, which Germany would certainly demand, requires unanimity on the Council as well as  a simple majority of the Assembly.  Moreover,  a candidate for election  must  give  &apos;&apos; effective guarantees of  its sincere intention to observe its international obligations.&quot;     14.  If points 6 and 7 in the German proposals are taken together, it may be hoped that they correspond to the demand which it was proposed to  make of Germany  as  regards the  situation  in  Central   and  Eastern  Europe  in Memorandum G. (36) 6.submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Germany on the 27th February.  It is there stated that &quot; Germany would have  to subscribe to the principle that in extending her influence in Central Europe she would not act in these regions in a manner which would be in conflict with the principles which we profess under  the Covenant, an act which would therefore compel us either to oppose  Germany or to  disavow our obligations.&quot;     15.  Account must now be taken  of omissions from the German proposals. There  is no reference to land  or air  armaments  limitation.  The opinion has already been expressed that further attempts at the limitation of land armaments were useless for the present (see Foreign Office memorandum of the 2nd March, G.  (36) 9).  As regards  air limitation,  the Air Ministry memorandum of the 2nd March, 1936 (G.  36) 5), showed the great difficulties of the question.   The Foreign Office view was that none the less an attempt ought to be made to secure it, though  in view of its difficulty it should not be made  an indispensable condition for the  conclusion of an air pact.     16.  The colonial  question is mentioned in  Point 7 of the German offer as a matter in which German  &quot; equality  of rights  &quot; is still incomplete and as one which will  have to be settled  &quot; in the  course  of a  reasonable period &quot; after Germany&apos;s return to the League.   None the less, as the  German Government warn us of their &apos;&apos; expectation &apos;&apos; in the matter, this is a problem which we shall have to face at once, if we decide to favour Germany&apos;s return to the League.     17.   It is interesting to note that other matters which have for some time been regarded as covered by the doctrine of equality of rights are not mentioned. Thus,there is  no mention either of the German  treaty obligation of the maintenance of free passage through the Kiel Canal or  of the  German obligation to  admit aninternational  regime   for  certain  of  their   rivers,  though  at  one  time      [12855]                                            &apos;       B 2
Baron  von Neurath definitely mentioned these matters as examples of lack of equality of rights.  There is also no mention of the question of the demilitarisation-tion of Heligoland.  This is not covered by Part V of the Treaty, and it has not sofar been raised by the German Government, though there is reason to believe thatthe island is in fact being refortified.  Danzig is not mentioned.                II. Positions of France, Belgium and Italy.France.    18.  M.  Flandin  informed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador  at Paris  on  the7th March (Paris telegram No. 108) that:     (1) The French Government did not wish to take up an isolated position,  but          to concert with the other Locarno Powers in order to bring the matter          before the Council of the League.    (2) They wanted a meeting of the Locarno Powers in Paris, and of  the          Council in Geneva.    (3) Though no  definite decision was yet taken, the French Government were       ^  thinking of asking the Council to condemn the action of Germany in          terms analogous to those used in condemning Germany&apos;s rearmament          on the 17th May,  1935.    (4) The French Government had asked the  Belgian Government to join with          them in communicating formally to the Council the  fact of Germany&apos;s          violation.    (5) The French Government were not definitely opposed to negotiations with          Germany, but they had little confidence in Germany&apos;s word, and they          could not negotiate under threat of  the denunciation of  Locarno and          under the menace of  a remilitarised zone  and the loss  of  French          seciiritjr.Belgium.    19.  The Belgian Charge d&apos;Affaires informed me on the 7th March that  theBelgian Government would  prefer  that Germany&apos;s violation should be broughtto the  Council&apos;s notice by all the Locarno signatories rather than by France andBelgium  alone, and that the Belgian Government would like a preliminary meeting of the  Locarno Powers before the Council with the least possible delay.He has been told in reply to  the first question that His Majesty&apos;s Government donot think it necessary to join with  the French  and Belgian Governments in  the communication to the Council.Italy.    20.  Italy  has given no indication of her attitude.             III. Future Policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.    21.  The myth is  now exploded that Herr  Hitler only repudiates treatiesimposed on Germany by force.  We must be prepared for him to repudiate anytreaty  even if freely negotiated (a) when it becomes inconvenient;  and (b) when germany  is sufficiently strong and the circumstances are otherwise favourable for doing so.    22.  On  the other hand, owing to Germany&apos;s material strength and powerof mischief in Europe, it is  in our interest to conclude with her as far-reachingand enduring a settlement as possible whilst Herr Hitler is still in the  mood todo  so.   But on entering upon this policy we must bear in mind that, whatevertime-limits may be  laid down in such a settlement, Herr Hitler&apos;s  signature canonly be considered as valid under the conditions specified above.    23.  It becomes necessary, therefore, to distinguish carefully between agree-ments  which, within these limitations,  are (a) advantageous and safe; (&amp;) unim-portant but expedient; and (c) dangerous.   In using the word &quot;dangerous&quot;it is not intended  to imply that such agreements are for this reason to be excludedab  initio, the point which it is desired to make is that they involve a definiterisk which must be taken into account.
                                                                             no    24.  Generally speaking, safe arid advantageous agreements would be thosegiving an immediate and more or less lasting relief from the present international tension, and the durability of which might be assumed by reason of the fact that herr  Hitler would not be making any concrete concessions or submitting to anyinconvenient restrictions in fact, agreements in which the spirit rather than theletter was the essential element.  Perhaps the Air Pact and the non-aggressionpacts and the return of Germany to the League might be placed in this category.    25.  Expedient but unimportant agreements would be those which might be useful for the time being for the improvement of the international atmosphereor in order to anticipate unilateral  action by Germany,  but which would not contain stipulations of vital importance to us.  In this category would fall allagreements for cancelling minor restrictions  imposed on Germany,  such  as theinternational  rivers  regime, the fortification of  Heligoland,  &amp;c, in  which germany would be the sole beneficiary.    26.  &quot;Dangerous&quot; agreements would clearly be those  in which we agreed with  Germany  to mutual  restrictions or  to  mutual concessions of  a  seriouscharacter.  In such cases it would have to be assumed that Germany might, ingiven circumstances, repudiate the restrictions, and, if it were within her  powerto do  so, withdraw  her concessions; whereas we  would continue  to considerourselves bound for the duration of the treaty in all respects.  In this categorywe must expect the French and other Powers to place certain kinds of armamentslimitation, agreements  for  the cession of  colonies in return for corresponding CUnuJUrconcessions on Germany&apos;s part, and  undertakings by Germany not  to interferewith Austria.   But, as stated above, the danger of repudiation by Germany neednot in every case mean that an agreement with Germany on these subjects is not worth seeking.   It is  clear, however, that  other  countries, and  particularlyFrance, more suspicious than we are of German good faith, will be inclined tomagnify the dangers  of agreement in these cases.    27.  Bearing the above considerations  in  mind,  the  immediate  problembefore His Majesty&apos;s  Government and its solution may be visualised as follows :     28.  We must p*e-venuany military action by France  against Germany.  Apossible  course  which  might have  its advocates  would  be  for the  Locarnosignatories to call upon Germany to evacuate the Rhineland.  It is  difficult nowto suppose that  Herr Hitler could  agree  to  such a demand,  and  it certainlyshould not be made unless the Powers, who made it, were prepared  to enforce it by military action.   Fortunately,  M. Flandin  has said that France will not act alone (i.e., under paragraph 3 of article 4 of Locarno), but will take the matter to the Council (i.e..  under  paragraph 2 of article 4 of  Locarno).  This he mustbe encouraged  to  do.  But we must beware  lest the French public, if furtherirritated or frightened, get restless  at such  a slow and  indecisive action and demand  retaliatory action  of a military  character such,  for instance, as thereoccupation of the Saar. Such a development must be avoided at all costs. ^    29.  While we  obviously cannot object  to  the Council adopting,  underarticle  4  (2)*  of Locarno,  a  &apos;&apos; finding &apos;&apos;  that  Germany has  violated the demilitarised zone provisions, this ought to be on the distinct understanding thatit is not to be followed by  a French  attack on Germany and  a  request for our armed  assistance under that  article.   An   understanding,  therefore,  as toprocedure at the  Council between the Locarno  Powers is essential  before theCouncil meets, and arrangements are being made to this end.    30.  We must be read)&apos;&apos;  at the Council to offer the French some satisfaction inreturn for their acquiescence in this tearing up of articles 42 and 43 of Versaillesand of the whole of Locarno.  Herr Hitler&apos;s offers to negotiate a new  &quot; Locarno &quot;and to return to the  League will not be enough.  In the face  of this fresh andgross insult to the sanctity of treaties, it will  be difficult to persuade the french to sign airy fresh agreement with Germany in present circumstances.  Indeed, how   *  Article 4 (2) of the Treaty of Locarno:        &quot; As soon as the Council of the League  of Nations is satisfied that such violation or   breach has been committed, it will notify its finding without delay to the Powers signatory   of the present treaty, who severally agree that in such case they&apos; will each  of them come   immediately to  the assistance of  the Power against whom the act  complained  of  is   directed.&quot;
16  -  Pcould it be otherwise, seeing that they have already been refusing to sign a naval agreement with Germany because of the  latter&apos;s repudiation of Part V of theTreaty of &quot;Versailles last year.  Some measure of satisfaction will therefore haveto be found before Herr Hitler&apos;s &quot; offers &quot; can be taken into consideration.  Thisis clear from the French views summarised in paragraph 18 (5) above.    31.  The following measures of satisfaction are conceivable :  (a) M. Flandinhas suggested a  formal condemnation by the  Council of  Germany&apos;s  action onthe lines of the condemnation administered last year in respect of  the repudiationof Part V of  the Treaty of Versailles.  In this connexion it might possibly be proposed to ask The Hague Court to pronounce agaitaatthe German argumentsregarding the incompatibility of the Franco-Russian Pact with  Locarno.   It isnot thought that this would be a wise course,  (b) The French may want to followthis up by applying the Council Resolution of May 1935  that the unilateralrepudiation of a treaty by a State, whether a member of  the  League of not,should,  in the event of such repudiation endangering peace, call into play all appropriate measures  on the  part  of members  of  the League, including inparticular measures of an economic and financial character, the nature of whichwas, however,  not determined by the Council.   We might indeed, will probably have  to agree  to jgiJisfa lafln/(g),  but we  ought  to  resist  satisfaction (&amp;)both on the ground  that it woula be impracticable, and also because it would be inconsistent with any idea of negotiation with Germany for a new settlement    32.  In return  for satisfaction  (a) we ought  to  try and get the Council France  and Belgium  agreeing to  recommend that the  complainant  powers should now proceed to put Germany&apos;s good  faith to the test by entering into negotiations with her with the object of (a) establishing a  new &quot; Locarno &quot; on thelines suggested by Herr Hitler; (b) concluding an air pact on the lines suggestedby us; (c) bringing about some sort of settlement in Eastern and Central Europe (itwon&apos;t amount  to much)  on the basis of the bilateral non-aggression pacts offered by Herr Hitler; (d) arranging for Germany&apos;s  unconditional return to the League.The Council would, in  fact, give Great Britain, France,  Belgium and  Italy a mandate and  carry on  these  negotiations with Germany with  instructions toreport periodically to the Council as to their progress.    33.  The  essential  thing  will  be  to induce or  cajole  France to  accept .this mandate.  The  trouble is that we are in a bad  position to browbeat her with *Xtfcwhat we think reasonableness, because, if she wishes to do so, she can always holdus to our Locarno obligation and call upon  us to join with her in turning theGerman forces out of the Rhineland.  The strength  of our  position lies in thefact that France is not in  the  mood  for  a military  adventure of this  sort.Unfortunately, between military action on the one hand and friendly negotiationon the other, there  lies  the policy of sulking  and  passive obstruction,  and  it is this policy to Which  the French Government, in their weakness, will be inclined tohave recourse,  and out of which we shall have to persuade them.                  34.  It will be essential, under present conditions, to do something to steady .         i 0 the situation, and I propose accordingly, and as an immediate step, that a state-.5Uxwv l^uisi I ment should be made in the House to-morrow/to the following effect : AAUUIAJ      I          &quot;His  Majesty&apos;s Government  regard  themselves, ^end-i-ftg the con-            \      sideration, which will obviously be necessary, of the  situation  created  by           -J      the German denunciation of the treaty, as still in honour bound to  come to                  the assistance of France or Belgium in the event of an actual attack  On them                  by Germany, which would constitute a violation of article 2 of Locarno, and                  to the assistance of Germany  in the event of such an attack upon her  by france or Belgium.&apos;Foreign Office, March 8, 1936.A.
