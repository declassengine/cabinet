                    AhNSX.1. PARAPHRASE  TELEGRAM  from  the  Secretary  of  State for  the  Colonies  to the High Commissioner for Palestine.       Sent 5.0 p.m.      30th  March, 193S.Mo s t Immedi a te .Secret and. Private.       Your private and secret telegram of the 28thMarch received.    I am most grateful to you for yourvery helpful attitude.       As regards what you say about a Round table conference, I feel that it would be inviting the Arabsto be obstructive if an assurance were first given as inparagraph 4 of your telegram, and I agree, therefore,that such a conference could not usefully now be proposed.       In my telegram of  the 25th March I did not attempt to elaborate the  two alternative suggestions whichwere made by members who  spoke in the debate, but ought to make  it clear that when Marcus Samuel suggested a Round Table Conference  he no doubt had in mind (and members generally would so understand it) not merely aconference between the Secretary of State and Jews and arabs, but a conference in which representatives ofparliamentary per ties would take part.       I am much interested by your alternativesuggestion that  I might invite a deputation representingchief Arab parties to come and put forward their case tome.   If this suggestion  were to be acted upon, I take it that your idea would be that we should put it to the Arabson the lines that I. understand that in general the Arab
parties wish to see the legislative Council established on the lines proposed;  that I have received a Jewishdeputation which has made strong representations againsta Legislative Council being set up at this time, and thatI should welcome a corresponding opportunity of hearingexpression of Arab opinion, and have, therefore, authorised  jjyou to extend an invitation to them to come here for thispurpose.   I observe that in paragraph 5 of your telegramyou refer to such an invitation following logically onpresentation of the three Arab demands last November.    take it that you have in view only the question of the       ij                                                             MLegislative Council and that you are not suggesting thatthe questions of land sales and immigration which werespecifically answered in the reply you were authorised       jto make to the Arab memorandum (see your telegram No.  26of 25th January) should be treated as still open.                                                              I       If Arabs are invited to London do you think they&quot;would wish to pay their own expenses?   If not, travelling expenses would have to be paid by Palestine Governmentin any case, but if you felt that it would be inappropriate tc I                                                              Imeet the expenses of Deputation in this country in that way,                                                             jjit might be for consideration whether application should be  jjmade to Government Hospitality,       I shall be bringing matter before Cabinet onWednesday and I should be grateful if I could have yourreply to this telegram early tomorrow afternoon.    It wouldbe helpful too if at the same time you could let me know what j&apos;ireaction there has been locally among Arabs and among jews to the Debate in the House of Commons, of which a full                                                             I summary has no doubt reached the Palestine press throughJewish Telegraphic Agency Bulletin or other sources.
2.   PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the High Commissioner for    Palestine to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    Dated 31st March, 1936.   Received 12.1 p.in.    31st March, 1936.MOST IMMEDIATE.Secret and Private.    Your Private and Secret telegramof 30th March.   I am  glad that you look favourably on my suggestion for an Arab deputation being invited toLondon.       I agree that the invitation which you send to theArab leaders should be on the lines which you suggest.But it is, I think, essential that it should includereference to the fact  that they have asked for alterations in the proposals made by His Majesty&apos;s Government for a legislative Council.   Consequently for the nine wordsbeginning &quot;wish to see&quot; in the fourth paragraph of yourtelegram I suggest that the following words should besubstituted &quot;wish to see Legislative Council establishedgenerally speaking on  the lines put forward in HisMajesty&apos;s Government&apos;s proposals, although you note thatthey ask for certain alterations&quot;.       I agree that the chief purpose of the Deputationwould be to discuss our proposals for Legislative Council.But it has long been the wish of the Arab leaders to havean opportunity to give expression to their views on landsales and immigration and as such an opportunity has beenafforded to the Jews,  I hope that, if Arabs ask me I maybe authorised to say that you will allow delegation tosubmit their ideas also on these two subjects.    ButI should not hold out any hope to them that you will
alter the views you have expressed in your reply which I coiiinunicated to them on the 29th January.       It would he the best course that Arab leaders should meet their own travelling expenses if they can afford it.But if I am satisfied that they cannot I think palestine government would be justified in paying.    This howeverwould give rise to Jewish criticism which I am anxiousto avoid.    It is, I think, very doubtful whether theycould afford expense of residence in London and I shouldbe most (? group omitted) if Government hospitalitymight be accorded.       You enquire as to local reaction to House ofCommons debate.    The Jews are jubilant but they havemade no attempt publicly to prophesy what effect if any the debates will have on Government action.    I am toldon good authority that they have boasted to the Arabsin private that they can square matters in London, the implication being that the Arabs have no effectiveaccess to Secretary of State.       The Arabs regard speeches in Parliament as out-pourings of men who are forgetful of England&apos;s pledgesor who through ignorance of the Arab case or as a resultof frequent meetings with Jews are blind to the truestate of affairs.    The Liwa,  which is the organ of thePalestine Arab Party, has been pressing for many monthsf or prooer Arab representation in London, and again onthe 29th March urged the necessity of the presence of an arab delegation in London at this juncture.    On the
same day the Rational Defence Party publicly acceptedGovernment proposals for Legislative Council and requested the High Commissioner to work for the immediate establish-ment of Legislative Council.    I know of no way by whichpresent feelings of the Arab resentment can be somollified as by giving Arab deputation opportunity ofstating their case in London.    In view of opinions expressed in recent speeches in the House of Commons  andthe House of Lords which the Arabs hold to be a furtherexample of Jewish influence in England I feel that if some such action is not taken at a very early date Arabfeeling will become still further embittered and negotia-tions may then be impossible.
