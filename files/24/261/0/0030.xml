Phipps(Berlin), cwering Memorandum handed to him by Herr von Ribhentrop on 1st,April, 1936.0Circulated by the Secretary  of  State for ForeignAffairs.\
Uncorrected.          Despatch No.,  400  to  Berlin recording conversation    with Herr von Ribbentrop on April 1st  1956 at  10  a.m.  and    covering G-erman Government&apos; s mrmoandum of  April 1st.  1956. Sir,     The Lord Privy Seal and I received Herr von Ribbentrop this morning on his return  to London.  He  was  accompanied  by Herr Dieokhoff.     2.  Herr von Ribbentrop informed me that  he had  come  to comiaunicate to me the new German peace plan prepared  by the Chancellor acting on the mandate received  from the German  people on March 29tho  Herr von Ribbentrop hoped  and  trusted that this plan would lead to the negotiations which  all  the nations desired and which would end in the consolidation of European peace.     5a  Herr von Ribbentrop then read out  the English trans- lation of the German Government&apos;s communication, which appears as an Annex to this despatch.     4.  le first discussed the question of publication; and it was agreed that the document should be given to the press  this evening for publication in the  morning newspapers of April 2nd,     5.  Lord Halifax and I then  put to Herr von Ribbentrop a number of questions on certain  points dealt with in the document.     6.  Herr von Ribbentrop explained that the four months period mentioned in the document  was to cover periods  (a)  the period for elucidating the  procedure of the negotiations and (b) the period of the actual negotiations:  and that the whole  period                                                    would....o
would continue until the end of July next.     7.  I then remarked upon the condition  (3) about theFrench and Belgian Governments acting in the sane way as theGerman Government in respect of the position on their sideof the frontier.  His Excellency replied that the French had brought a number of new divisions into their fortress line.The German Government did not like this;  but all they were asking was that in the early stage of the negotiations British influence should be used to restore to some extent theoriginal position.  There was no question of the German Govern-ment increasing their troops at the moment, but it was thoughtthat His Majesty&apos;s Government might induce the French Governmentto restore more normal conditions on their side of the frontier,They had tripled or even quadrupled their forces in that region.
     8.   Lord Halifax  said  that he understood point 9 to refer to  fortifications as well  as to men,     9.   He then enquired whi with regard  to point 10 the German Government had suggested a period of twenty-five years  for the duration of the non-aggression pact-    Why was the period  not unlimited?   Herr von Ribbentrop replied that in recent years  it had been the custom to  fix the period  of ten years for the period of duration of these pacts,.   Monsieur Laval had, however, recently told one of Herr  von Ribbentrop&apos;s  friends that twenty- five years would he a better period.   It was not that the German Government did not want an unlimited period of peace;  hut, as realists, they were inclined to think  a period of twenty-five years (the span of a generation) better than an unlimited period. Herr von Dieckhoff referred  at this point to Dr. Cunc&apos;s proposals of 1925 which had envisaged a period of twenty-five years for  such pacts.     10.   Herr von Ribbentrop remarked vdth reference to points 10,  11 and 12 that the German Government was now not only ready to enter into non-aggression pacts but into mutual assistance pacts.    This was new,    It had originally been proposed that the Western non-aggression pact should be guaranteed by Great Britain and Italy;   now the German Government were ready themselves to give mutual assistance to the other parties.     11.   I enquired whether the German Government had definitelybeen unable to act on my proposal respecting the non construction of fortifications during the interim period.   Was it not possible even to give this undertaking if the French on their side also undertook not to construct&quot;during this period?     12.   Herr von Ribbentrop replied that  the interim period  was only one  of four months.   What could be done  in four months?The  German Government  could not give any.-pledge  in respect  oven of that period;   but in fact,  for technical reasons,  it  would beimpossible  to construct, during this  period,
   13.   I replied that 1  was not asking for this concessionfor any military reason but for psychological and political reasons.  Herr von Ribbentrop said that the French knewperfectly well that nothing could, for technical reasons,be done during the interim period.  I said that 1 was stilllooking for something which would help me during the interimlimited period.   14.   I said that there was one further point in the docu-ment to which I must refer, it was that of the Staff conversa-tions.   it was not possible that Germany, having denouncedthe Locarno Treaty, should, still say that the other powers should, not have Staff conversations even during the interim period.  Lord Halifax remarked that he thought that on thispoint the document referred not to the interim but to the laterperiod.  Herr Dieckhoff was understood to say that this was so;but herr von Ribbentrop himself reiterated that the Germanpeople could not understand why Staff talks were necessary when there vras no military menace.   If Juropean peace was desiredany step likely to make a final settlement more difficultought to be avoided..   15.    Herr von Ribbentrop then enquired if it would not bemore useful to start  the negotiations in an atmosphere of calmi.e.  after the French elections.   16.    I reminded him that in the white Paper we had asked theGerman Government for three concessions to bridge  over the interim period.   They had been able to give none of them.  There-fore I was still in a great difficulty over the interim, period.However I would carefully examine  the document  which Herr von ribbentrop had communicated in consultation with my colleagues andI hoped that  I might  be in a position to see him again some time on the following day,  April 2nd.
Translation.Peace Plan of the German Government         of 51st March, 1956  handed to the British Government                 by     Ambassador von Ribbentrop      on the 1st April, 1956.
     It was with the heartiest approval that  the GermanGovernment learnt from Ambassador von Ribbentrop that it isthe wish of the British Government and the British people to begin as soon as possible with the practical work fora real pacification of Europe.  This desire is in full accord with the innermost intentions and hopes of the Germanpeople and their Government.  The German Government there-fore regret it all the more that they are not able torecognize in the draft presented by the representatives ofthe Locarno Powers which was presented to them on 20th Marcha valid and fruitful basis for the introduction and; carry-ing out of such a genuine work of peace.   In the eyes of theGerman people and of their Government this draft lacks thatspirit of understanding of the laws of honour and equality of status which have always been in the life of the peoplesthe primary condition for the conclusion of free, and thussacred, treaties.     The German Government believe that they owe it to the seriousness of the  task with which they are faced to limit their statement of the negative aspects of the memorandumpresented to them to the most essential points.   They will however endeavour,  by amplifying and clarifying the pro-posals  made by them on 7th March,  to facilitate  the beginningof concrete work for the securing of European  peace.     The German Government must make the  followingfundamental statements in order to make it comprehensible                                                     why.000*
mm                                                          2cwhy they rejected certain discriminatory points, as wellas to explain the reasons for their constructive proposals:     The German Government have just received from theGerman people among other things a solemn general mandateto represent the Reich and the German nation along thefollowing two lines:     lo  The German people are determined to preserve underall circumstances their freedom, their independence, andthus their equality of status.  They regard the advocatingof these natural international principles of state life asa precept of national honour, and as a necessary condition for any practical co-operation between the nations, fromwhich they can under no circumstances make any furtherdeparture.     2,  The German people most sincerely desire to co-operate with all their might in the great work of a general international reconciliation and understanding between theEuropean nations, for the x^irpose of safeguarding for thiscontinent that peace which is so necessary for its cultureand its welfare.     These are the desires of the German people, which aretherefore binding on the German Government.                     x          x                          x     The German Government would like further to make  thefollowing remarks, in pursuance of their fundamental attitude,which was already stated in their preliminary note of   March24th, 1956:                                                       (A)..a .
     A)  In the year 1918 Germany signed, the Armistice,which was based on the fourteen points of President Wilson.None of these contemplated any limitation of Germansovereignty in the Rhine territory.  On the contrary, themain principle on which these points were based was theconstruction of a new international order, which should leadto a better and permanent peace.  It was to do the fullestjustice to the principle of self-determination of peoples,and without regard to victor or vanquished.     B)  The British Foreign Minister, in an address madeon the 26th of March on the subject of the demilitarizedzone stated that in the last analysis this was only a quidpro quo for the attempt made by France in 1918 to separate the Rhineland from Germany.  From this statement it can beseen that the demilitarized zone is nothing more nor lessthan the result of an already perpetrated breach of con-ditions &quot; which were binding on the Allies too.     C)  The provisions of the Treaty of Versailles dealingwith the demilitarization were themselves based on a breach of an assurance made to Germany, and had nothing to backthem except force.  These provisions of the Treaty ofVersailles were incorporated into the Locarno Pact, after.a further infringement of right, namely the occupation ofthe Ruhr territory, which was characterized as a breach of international law by British law officers of the Crown.     I),)  The so-called &quot;voluntary abandonment&apos;1 of sovereigntyrights on the part of Germany over these Western provinces of the Reich is thus a result of the                                             Versailles.....
                                                 4.Versailles  &quot;Dictate&quot;, and of a sequence of severeoppressions of the German people resulting from thisdictate  In this connexion especial reference must bemade  to the terrible distress and helplessness of the reich in consequence of the occupation of the Rhineland.      If now the British Government declare that it wascustomary to speak of the &quot;Dictate&quot; of Versailles, butthat  nothing is known of a &quot;Dictate&quot; of Locarno, the GermanGovernment  must answer by putting this question:  &quot;was thereever  or could there ever be a great nation in the worldwhich voluntarily has given up or would give up itssovereignty unilaterally, and without any pressure from outside, and, as in this case, abandon its most primitiveright of defending its own frontiers?&quot;      Nevertheless the German nation has tolerated such astate of affairs for seventeen years, and as late asmay 21st, 1955, the German Chancellor declared &quot;that inthe demilitarized zone the Reich Government was payingheavily as  a sovereign State for the peace and quiet ofEurope&quot; and that the Reich &quot;will fulfill all the obliga-tions arising out of the Locarno Treaty just as long asthe other parties to the Treaty are willing to keep it infull  force.&quot;     The German Government in their preliminary note ofMarch 24th,  1956, called attention to the  fact that  themilitary alliance concluded between France and SovietRussia deprived the Locarno Treaty of the  legal andespecially  the political assumptions on which it was based and thus of the reason for its existence.
     It is thus not necessary to go into this matter again in detail for:     There is no doubt whatever that the tendency to involve Europe in a network of military alliances is contrary to the spirit and purport of the establishing ofa real community of nations.  There is an ever-increasingdanger that out of this general entanglement in militaryalliances a situation will arise once more which will be similar to that to which Y/as principally due the outbreakof the world&apos;s most frightful and most senseless war.     It is not within the power of a single Governmentto prevent such a development originated by certain Powers,but it is the duty of every Government within the limits of its own sovereign power to guard itseIf against allsurprises which might arise out of such impenetrableEuropean military and cabinet policies.     The German Government has therefore,  in view of thepresent situation,  which implies the removal of thelegal and political assumptions on which the Locarno Pactwas based,  have,  for their part,  declared themselves as no more bound by the terms of this Pact,  and have restoredthe sovereignty of  the Reich over the  entire german territory.
      The German Government are  not in the position to  pre- sent their measure which they have adopted for the security of the Reich,  which involves  only territory of the German Reich, and is  a menace  to no  one,  for the judgment of  a body which,  in the most favourable case,  is only  in the position to  judge  the legal aspect of this  measure,  but  is not  under any  circumstances whatsoever, capable of judging  the political aspects.   This is all the more  true  as  the Council of the League  of Nations has  already  taken  a decision  pre- judicing the legal  judgment of the  question.      Furthermore the German Government are  convinced that such a verdict  could not  possibly  contribute anything of a constructive nature to  the real solution  of  the question of European security, but rather would only be inclined tomake  such a solution more difficult if not, indeed, to prevent  it entirely.      Incidentally, either one believes in the possibilityof the  securing of a general European peace, in which casesuch  an attack on the sovereignty of a state can onlyaggravate matters, or one does not believe in such a possi-bility of securing peace, in which case such a decision would at the best only have a post factum juridical..significance.     The German Government, therefore, on this point aswell  as on the  others contained  in the draft proposal pre-sented by the representatives  of the Locarno Powers which
are without exception unilaterally detrimental to Germany, notonly cannot see any advantageous contribution for a truly broadand constructive solution of the question of European security,but can only see elements of discrimination against a greatnation, which thus make permanent peace questionable.     In accordance with the mission entrusted them by theGerman people, the German Government must decline all one-sided proposals which would, lead to any discrimination against Germany.     As is obvious from her offer,  Germany does not everintend to attack France or Belgium.    And, taking into con-sideration France&apos;s colossal armaments and the enormousfortresses on her Eastern frontier,  it is well known thatsuch an attack would be senseless from the purely military point of view alone.     Also from this point of view the desire of-the FrenchGovernment for immediate negotiations with the General staff is incomprehensible to the German Government.   The latter would regard it  as  seriously prejudicial if such agreements were arrived at  with the General Staff before  the conclusionof the new security pacts.     They are  of the  opinion that such agreements can in anycase only take place  as a result of  the political obligations to support one another of the five Locarno Powers,  and then only on strictly reciprocal  grounds&apos;.
                                                    ten,  &quot;*&apos;                                                    A si 5                                                     8.     The German Government are further of the opinion thatto arrive at an easier solution of the present- problems,these must be divided up according to the aims in view.The German Government must then put the following fundamentalquestions:     Towards what goal is European diplomacy going to directits efforts?a)   Is this goal to be that division of Europe which hasalready shown itself unsuitable for any lasting guarantee ofpeace, a division of peoples into those with more or lessequality, into honourable&apos; and dishonourable nations, freepeoples and unfree peoples, to be preserved or continued in some new form or other or with modifications?     Impelled by such a desire, does European diplomacyfurther intend to arrive at conclusions on past events,based on majority decisions, and to pronounce sentences inorder to find those legal grounds, apparently lacking, for continuing in such a state, orB)   Are the Governments of Europe going to direct their efforts towards achieving at all costs a really con-structive state of affairs amongst the nations of Europe,and thus arrive at a lasting and secure form of peace?     The German Government owe It to their people to declare plainly here that they will only participate in thesecond attempt, which, in their opinion is the only con-structive one;   and moreover they make this declaration with
                                                        9*,the profoundest possible conviction and with the who^e weightof the sincere will and desire of the people behind them.     The German Government believe that the task facing thestatesmen of Europe should then be divided into three periodsas follows\-     a)   A period in which the tension has gradually calmeddown, and in which to elucidate the procedure for thenegotiations which are, to be started.     b)   A period for the actual negotiations for securingthe peace of Europe.     c)   A later period for dealing with those desirablesupplements to the work of peace in Europe, which cannot andshould not be exactly determined or limited as to contentsor size from&apos; the very begimiingo    (Questions of disarmament,economics etc.)   To  this end the German. Government propose the following peace plan:-1)   In order to give the future agreements securing thepeace of Europe the character of inviolable treaties, thosenations participating in the negotiations do so only on anentirely equal footing, and as equally esteemed members.   the sole compelling reason for signing these treaties can only lie in the generally recognised and obvious, practicability ofthese agreements for the peace of Europe,  and thus for thesocial happiness and economic prosperity of the nations.2)   In order to abbreviate the period of uncertainty In theeconomic interests of the European nations,  the GermanGovernment propose a limit of four months for the first                                            period,,..
                                                         i&quot; e*j                                                       3 a 7                                                    10.period, up to the signing of the non-aggressive pactsguaranteeing the peace of Europe.5)   The German Government give the assurance not to add anyreinforcements whatsoever to the troops in the Rhinelandduring this period, always provided that the Belgian andFrench Governments act analogously.4)   The German Government give the assurance not to moveduring this period the troops at present stationed in the rhineland closer to the Belgian and French frontiers.5)   The Gerraan Government propose the setting up cf a corn-mission composed of the two guarantor Powers, England andItaly, and a disinterested third neutral Power, to guaranteethese assurances to he given by both parties.6)   Germany, Belgium and France are each entitled to send a representative to this Commission.   If Germany, belgium and France think that, for any particular reason they canpoint to a change in the military situation having takenplace within this period of four months, they then have theright to inform the Guarantee Commission of their observa-tions.7)   Germany, Belgium and France declare their willingness,in such a case to permit this Commission to make thenecessary investigations/through the English and Italianmilitary attaches, and to report thereon to the Powersparticipating.8)   Germany, Belgium and France give the assurance thatthey will bestow the fullest consideration to theobjections arising therefrom.
9)   Moreover, the German Government are willing, on a&quot;basis of complete reciprocity with her two Western neighbours,to agree to any military limitations on the German 1 &apos;esternfrontier.10)   Germany, Belgium and France and the two guarantor-Powers agree to enter into negotiations under the leadership of the British Government at once or at the latest, after theFrench eleetions, for the conclusion of a 25-years non-aggression or security pact between France and Belgium onthe one hand, and Germany on the other.11)   Germany agrees that England and Italy shall sign thissecurity pact as guarantor-Powers once more.12)   Should special engagements to render military assistancearise as a result of these security agreements, Germany forher part, declares her willingness, also to enter into suchengagement s.15)   The German Government hereby repeat their proposal forthe conclusion of an air-pact to supplement and consolidatethese security agreements.14)   The German Government repeat that should theNetherlands so desire they are willing to include thiscountry  too in this West-European security agreement.15)   In order to stamp this peace-pact, voluntarily enteredinto between Germany and France, as the reconciliatory con-clusion of a centuries-old dispute, Germany and Francepledge themselves to take steps to see that in the educa-tion of  the young as well as in the press and publications                                                 of ...
of both nations everything shall be avoided, which might be calculated to poison the relationship between the twopeoples-, whether it be a derogatory or contemptuous attitude,or inroroper interference in the internal affairs of theother country. They agree to set up at the headquarters ofthe League of Nations at Geneva, a joint commission whosefunction it shall be to lay before the two governments forinformation and investigation all complaints received.  16)  In pursuance of their intention to give this agreement the character of a sacred pledge, Germany and France under-take to ratify it by means of a plebiscite of the two nations.  17)  Germany expresses her willingness, for her part, toestablish contact with the states on her South-eastern andforth-eastern frontier, in order to invite them directly to conclude the non-aggressive pacts already proposed.,    ,  18)  &quot;Germany expresses her willingness to re-enter theLeague of Nations, either at once, or after the conclusionof these agreements.     /&apos;t the same time, the German Government again express their expectation that, after a reasonable time and by themethod of friendly negotiations the Question of colonialequality of rights, and that of the separation of theCovenant of the League of Nations from its foundations inthe Versailles Treaty will be cleared up.  19)  Germany proposes the setting up of an international court of Arbitration, which shall be responsible for the observance of the various agreements concluded,  and whosedecisions shall be binding on all parties.             x       v            X                     X                           After
                                                  15.     After the conclusion of this great work of securingEuropean peace, the German Government consider it urgently necessary to endeavour &quot;by practical measures to put a stopto the unlimited competition in armaments.  In their opinionthis would mean not merely an improvement in&quot; the. financialand economic position of the nations, but above all a diminution of the psychological tension.     The German Government, however, have no faith in the attempt to bring about universal settlements, as thisWould be doomed to failure from the outset and can there-fore be proposed only by those who have no interest in. acbiev-ing practical results.  On the other hand they are of theopinion that the negotiations held and the results achieved in limiting naval armaments should have an instructiveand stimulating effect.     The German Government therefore propose that infuture conferences shall have one, clearly definedobjective.     For the present, they consider the most importanttask is to bring aerial warfare into the&apos;moral and humanatmosphere of the protection afforded to non-combatantsor the wounded by the Geneva Convention.  Just as thekilling of defenceless wounded, or prisoners, or the useof dumdum bullets, or the waging of submarine warfarewithout warning, have been either forbidden or regulated by international conventions&quot;, so it.must be possible forcivilised humanity to prevent the senseless abuse of any new type of weapon without running.counter to the objectof warfare.                                            /                                                  The /
     The German Government therefore pat forward thepropose! that the immediate practical tasks of these conferences shall he;     1)  Prohibition of dropping gas, poison, orincendiary bombs.     2)  Prohibition of dropping bombs of any kind what-soeyer on open towns and villages outside the range of the medium-heavy artillery of the fighting fronts.     3)  Prohibition of the bombarding of towns distantmore than 20 km. from the battle zone with long-range guns,     4)  Abolition and prohibition of the construction of tanks of the heaviest type.     5)  Abolition and prohibition of artillery of the heaviest calibre.     As soon as possibilities for further limitation ofarmaments emerge from such discussions and agreements,they should be utilized.     The German Government hereby declare themselves now prepared to join in  every such settlement, in so far asit is valid internationally.     The German Government believe that if even a first step is made on the  road to disarmament, this will be ofenormous importance  for the relationship between thenations, and for the recovery of confidence, trade and prosperity.     In accordance with the general  desire for therestauration of  favourable economic conditions the GermanGovernment are  prepared immediately  after the conclusion                                                 of
                                                       K 7                                                       U &amp;                                               15.of the political treaties to enter into an exchange of opinions on economic problems with the other nationsconcerned, in  the spirit of the proposals made, and todo all that lies in their power to improve the economicsituation in Europe and the world economic situationwhich is closely bound UP with it.            X                       X                     X     The German Government believe that with the peaceplan proposed above they have made their contribution tothe reconstruction of a new Europe on the basis of reciprocal respect and confidence between sovereign States.Many opportunities for such a pacification of Europe,for which Germany has so often in tie last few years madeher proposals, have been neglected,   may this attempt  to achieve European understanding succeed at last.&apos;     The German Government confidently believe that theyhave opened the way in this direction by submitting theabove peace plan.
