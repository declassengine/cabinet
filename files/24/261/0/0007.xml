 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT                   Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1936.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.CP. 77 (36).CABINET.The Imperial Conference.      MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS.     A QUESTION requiring consideration is the date of the next ImperialConference.   The  last  full  Imperial  Conference was  held  in  London  inOctober-November 1930; this was followed by an Imperial Economic Conferenceheld at Ottawa in July-August 1932.  The occasion of the visit of the dominion prime Ministers to London for the King&apos;s Silver Jubilee celebrations was takento hold informal meetings in  London in May 1935.  The discussions then relatedprimarily to questions of foreign policy and defence, and  no public statement was made as to the scope or effect of the meetings, which were treated as purelyinformal.     2.  It seems  to me that the date of the next Conference must necessarily  be governed by that  of the Coronation, the arrangements  for which are now underdiscussion, but which  seems  likely to take place  in May 1937.   The dominion prime Ministers  will  presumably be invited here  for that event and in  thesecircumstances it would no  doubt be impossible for most of  them to contemplatea visit to this country during any part of 1936 for the purpose of an ImperialConference.  It would appear best therefore to propose holding the next ImperialConference at or about the time of the Coronation.     3.  A table is annexed showing that  there is no reason to believe that anyof the Dominion Governments, except perhaps Australia, would have any special difficulty,  as a result  of their own Election dates, in  sending  delegates  to  aConference early  in the summer  of 1937.  Some  difficulty may  arise in regardto Australia in view of the fact that an Election must be  held there before october 1937.     4.  So  far as  questions  for discussion  are  concerned,  the  international situation and questions connected with defence would form major issues.  It hasbecome more impossible than ever to  foreshadow the course of events  in theinternational sphere, but whatever  it may be a further opportunity of personalconsultation with the  Dominion Prime Ministers  will  be  most valuable.   Asregards  defence also,  an Imperial  Conference  would afford an  opportunity of explaining to  the Dominions in greater detail than is  possible  by telegram ordespatch the progress  of our plans for meeting  defence requirements, and of discussing ways and means for promoting whatever co-operation may be possiblein the matter (though I do not propose to delay now in opening the  question  with dominion Governments).    5. As regards constitutional questions,  it would not appear that there  is any special issue outstanding  (apart from the dispute with the  Irish Free State),but we should have, of course, to be prepared if any questions are  raised by theDominions.    6. The position in regard to  Imperial trade discussions is  more difficult.The minimum term of the Ottawa Agreements (except that with India which      [12899]
 may be denounced at any time on six months&apos; notice) expires in August 1937, but if not denounced six months before that date, the Agreements will remain in force thereafter until  six months  after notice of denunciation  shall have been given. Thus, it  may  become necessary to  discuss with any of  the  Dominions within the next year the future of their respective Agreements.     7.  Certain  interests both  here  and in the  Dominions are dissatisfied  with particular aspects  of these Agreements and, if they were discussed in  detail at any Conference,  we should on  the one hand be  subject to strong  and combined political pressure from the Dominions to make further concessions to them, while on the other hand we should  be pressed  by our  own industrialists to secure modifications of Dominion policy and practice as well as by our own agriculturists to secure modifications of the Agreements  in their favour.  In other words, we should be heading for a difficult negotiation in circumstances unfavourable to ourselves and with the Dominions lined up on the other side of the table.     8.  For this reason,  it would seem very desirable, if possible,  to avoid any formal and general Imperial Economic Conference. In  any case, discussion  of complicated trade  questions would be  undesirable  in a Conference  held on the occasion of the Coronation, since bargaining in regard to the results of the Ottawa Agreements could  not  fail to involve  a controversial discussion, and would,  I suggest,  more appropriately take  place,  on a suitable occasion,  with   each Dominion separately, rather than in the full publicity of an. Imperial Conference.     9.  So far as  Australia is concerned,  a Ministerial  delegation,  headed by the Deputy Prime  Minister  and the  Attorney-General, is already on its way to the  United  Kingdom,  and  this will afford an  opportunity  for  any  separate discussion with Australia that may be necessary.   So far as Canada is concerned, it is understood that the Prime Minister or the Minister  of Finance, or possibly both, may wish to come here during this summer in order to talk over the question of amendments to the Ottawa Agreement.  In  conversation with  the  United Kingdom High Commissioner at Ottawa, the Canadian Minister of Finance has expressed a strong preference for such bilateral discussion rather than discussion at a  formal Imperial  Conference and  has enquired the views of  the  United Kingdom Government on the matter.   Discussions  might take place with the representatives of other Dominions as opportunity offers.     10.   Before, however, the  Cabinet  comes to  a conclusion, in regard to the future of the Ottawa Agreements it will be necessary  for consideration to be given  to certain economic and agricultural  topics which arise  out of our Agree- ments both with  Dominions  and with foreign countries,  and I understand that the President  of the Board of Trade and  the Minister of Agriculture  and Fisheries will circulate a memorandum on  the subject.     11.   I hope  it will be possible to include the question of migration in the Conference agenda, especially if between now and the  Conference these trade questions can be settled for a further period.     12.   But it is premature at this stage to take any actual decisions regarding the topics to be discussed.   All that requires early decision is the date of the Conference, and  I suggest that  a telegram  should now be sent to the Dominion Prime Ministers, in conjunction with that which will be sent to them regarding the date of the  Coronation itself, proposing a meeting of the Imperial Conference at or about the time of the Coronation, and enquiring whether this date would be suitable.  A similar communication would presumably be sent to India.   It might be wise  to give some  idea in  the  message as to our tentative proposalsconcerning the agenda.  We could arrange for the inter-departmental machinery for the further consideration of questions relating to the agenda to get to work. Most of this machinery is already in existence. No doubt the establishment of aspecial Cabinet Committee to supervise the preparations  would be  desirable at a later stage.     13.   With regard to the  Irish Free State, I think that it would be best to send the same communication to that Dominion as to the  others.  Whether they accept or  not, I feel that for us to invite them would be the right course from  our point  of view.

As regards Southern Rhodesia, the Prime Minister will presumably beinvited to  attend the Coronation, just as he was invited  to attend the silver jubilee last year.   It would be  desirable,  I think,  to  arrange,  subject to  theconcurrence of the Dominions,  that he should take an appropriate part in  theConference.  The arrangement made as regards the Ottawa Conference was thatthe Southern Rhodesian delegates were invited as observers.   A similar arrange-ment would appear suitable as regards the forthcoming Conference, the object being to ensure the presence of Southern Rhodesian representatives when  mattersof special concern to them were being discussed.     15.  No special action, at any rate at this stage, appears necessary as  regardsNewfoundland in view of its present constitutional position.
