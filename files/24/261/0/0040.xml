Sir,             We have the honour to report that we have completed        the Staff Conversations with French and Belgian representa-        tives in accordance with instructions by His Majesty&apos;s        Government.            -(2) A plenary meeting was held on Wednesday,  the 15th,        in the Board Room of the Admiralty, at which Admiral James        defined the  scope of the Conversations.   The French and        Belgian representatives expressed themselves in full accord        with the purport of Admiral James&apos;  explanation.             (3) The meeting then adjourned and the Conversations        vrere continued at the three Ministries,             (4) The Naval Staff Conversations were limited to  an        interchange  of information with regard to ports and the state        of forces now in commission,  and certain questions with        regard to communications,  liaison officers and signal code.        The  Conversations were, therefore,  brief,  but  were satis-        factory to the French and Belgian representatives.             (5) The Military Staff Conversations were limited  to  a        statement of the British forces available  and  a request to        French military representatives for information as  to        facilities at  ports,  transport  from ports  to assembly area,        and  assembly areas.    In addition,  air protection  in port        and  assembly areas was  discussed.    It  was  agreed  that  the        questions raised should be  studied  in  the War  MinistriesThe Right  Hon.     Sir Thomas  Inskip,  C.B.E.,  K.G., M.P.-1-
concerned and the information transmitted through &quot;tii^ 0 ^Military Attaches,     The French and. Belgian military representativesexpressed themselves as satisfied with the Conversations.The Belgian representative raised the question of theprovision of war material in the event of aggression ByGermany and the destruction of Belgian factories.   Itwas pointed out that this was outside the terms of thepresent Conversations, but was a matter for discussion between the Governments of the two countries.     (6) The Air Staff Conversations were complicated bythe fact that the French representatives produced a &quot;plan of work&quot; which covered, far more ground than the british representatives were authorised to explore.   Some of thepoints, such as the strengths of the respective forces andthe availability of aerodromes, were fully discussed, andothers concerning technical detail were remitted for further examination by the Service Attaches.   It was, of course,inevitable that the discussions on a number of subjects,.being outside the scope of the Conversations, had to be&quot;reserved&apos;.   In general, however, the talks were consideredby all delegations to have been useful and satisfactory.     (7) A final plenary meeting was held in the BoardRoom at the Admiralty during the afternoon of April 16th.Admiral James, on behalf of the British representatives,expressed.their view that the Conversations had been entirely satisfactory, and that certain ground had beenexplored which, if ever the time came to extend the scopeof the Conversations, would be extremely useful.   TheFrench and Belgian representatives expressed themselves  in.
entire accord with these sentiments.     It was agreed that each Service should prepare aproces-verbal- as a record of the proceedings.                 We have the honour to he,                           Sir,                      Your obedient Servants,          (Signed) W.M. JAMES,    J.G. DILL,      C.L. COURTNEY.                   Vice-Admiral.
