This document is the property of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.Printed for the Cabinet, March,  1.936           secret.                                                                     1                                                                  COPY No.4 4CP.  92  (36)THE CABINETRECRUITING FOR THE ARMY       MEMORANDUM BY  THE SECRETARY OF  STATE  FOR WAR     1. I desire to draw the attention of the Cabinet to the shortage of recruits for the     27Army, and to the need for vigorous action to remedy the present position if  we are to  Generalmaintain our overseas garrisons and  be in  a position to mobilize the Field Force  at    9389war strength.     2. I will not  trouble my colleagues with detailed  figures, but the  calculation ofour assets and liabilities  on mobilization shows  that the  number of  serving Regularsoldiers is already 10,000 men  short of  the Peace Establishment to which we recruit.During the period ending  March, 1940, in addition to making up this deficit, we shall require to recruit, in order to make up losses owing to completion of engagements andwastage and  to meet certain increases of establishment, including four new infantry battalions,  about  139,260 men, a gross total of  149,260.   The  situation, therefore, isas follows :-     (a)  We require for the five years  to  31st  March, 1940,  an  annual           intake of recruits of  149,260-^-5^    ...     .........     29,852*     (b)  At the present rate of enlistment intake is  unlikely to exceed ...     26,500*     (c)  The annual intake will therefore fall short of requirements by ...      3,352     3. At first sight the shortage set down at  (c) of  the preceding paragraph maynot appear a very serious matter, but it should be realized that it is cumulative in effect,and would result,  if it were allowed  to  continue, in a shortage  of  serving soldiers  of16,760 by 1940.     4. So far as  Peace requirements are concerned,  the recruiting shortage will makeit impossible to maintain the units  of the Army  at the strength required for efficienttraining and  will seriously affect the provision of drafts for Infantry battalions overseas.The bulk  of any shortage is  necessarily borne  by the Infantry, and, if there is no improvement, the  average strength of battalions  at Home  by 1940 will  be reduced to346 as compared with an establishment of  763.   At such low strengths it will clearly be impossible for the battalions at Home to find  the annual drafts  of about  150 men for battalions abroad.  Moreover it has been found that the present number of infantry battalions is  inadequate to  meet  our peace time requirements  and we have therefore decided to raise 4  more battalions, 2 of which, it  is hoped,  will  be  formed during thecurrent year.     5. The results will be, if possible, even more serious from the point of view of ourmobilization  requirements.  Broadly  speaking   every two  recruits are  calculated toproduce one reservist, and a shortage of serving soldiers results in a shortage of reservists.it is possible, of course, to allow men whose normal period of reserve service has expiredto continue in the Reserve (Section D) for further periods ; but a reservists loss  ofmilitary efficiency after leaving  the Colours proceeds  with increasing  rapidity, and as theproportion of such Section D  reservists is already  dangerously high, we cannot have further recourse  to this  expedient.   If there is a considerable deficiency  in  Peacestrengths, there is bound to be a  growing  deficiency in the strength of the Reserve.    * Latest experience indicates that the recruiting intake for  the current  year will  not  exceed24,000. In that case the average annual requirements from 1936 to 1940 become about 31,450.
On mobilization  units already much below strength will  be still  further reduced bythe necessity of shedding men ineligible or  unfit for active service, and there will notbe sufficient reservists to bring them up to war  establishment.  If that be allowed to happen the efficiency of the Army in war cannot be assured.     6.  The forecast of recruiting in paragraph 2 above is based on years of experience,and may be regarded as trustworthy.   Under existing conditions there is no reason  to expect  an improvement ;  on  the  contrary it  seems  possible  that if the deterrentinfluences, relerred to below, are allowed to continue, there will be a further falling off.In addition, wastage  from the Army is steadily increasing ;  applications for dischargeon  compassionate grounds or  by purchase are in excess of the normal, and desertion, regret to say, is growing  in  frequency.   This is a sure sign of dissatisfaction with theconditions of military service.  The  consequent loss is considerable and  adds  to ourrecruiting requirements.     7.  The situation is disquieting.  Recruitment of the numbers required is essential if the r&amp;le of the Army, as  dictated by national policy, is to  be  fulfilled.  Since therecan be no question of a compulsory system of recruitment in  peace time, immediate steps must  be taken to  remove  those factors which at  present militate against thesuccess of voluntary recruitment, upon which we are wholly dependent.     8.  Recruiting will not flourish unless soldiers are contented during their term  ofmilitary service.  The greatest  enemy  to recruiting  is  the discontented  soldier  orex-soldier.   There  are  disturbing signs,  to  which  I have  already  referred,  thatdissatisfaction  with  Army conditions is increasing.   This  dissatisfaction is communi-cated to the public, and the result is poor  recruiting.  The  Army  Council are  fullyalive to the  causes of this  feeling, and, given the  means,  are prepared  to remedy  it.The potential recruit and  his family  make a comparison  between  Army pay,  whichbegins at 14s. a week, and the 17s. that  the young man  can draw  in unemploymentbenefit.  The many other advantages of  Army  service  are overlooked  and the  more substantial cash payment  to the home which is made by the  boy drawing unemploymentbenefit  compares favourably with the soldier son&apos;s contribution.  This militates againstrecruiting.     Admittedly  it  is not  entirely a  question  of  money.   Much,  can be  done, forinstance, by ensuring that the training  and discipline, to which the soldier  may  besubject, are  not unnecessarily irksome, and that he does  not  find  himself associatedwith men of bad character.   The Army Council, fully realizing the importance of thesematters in connection&apos;with recruiting, keep a constant watch upon them, and they  havequite recently been the subject of a letter addressed to all General  Officers Commanding.A copy of the letter is printed as an appendix to this memorandum.     Apart,  however, from  these  entirely  military factors,  it  is  essential that theconditions under which the soldier serves  and lives shall compare favourably with thoseobtaining in civil life.   At present they do not, and one source of grievance cannot  be remedied without the substantial expenditure  on barracks and quarters,which is now contemplated under the Report of the Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements.The question of the provision of further vocational training arrangements to enable the soldier to have a reasonable chance of competition in the labour market on his returnto civil life,  is under consideration.     9.  Similarly  a  recent investigation  ordered by Army Headquarters in India intothe conditions of service in that country has brought to  light many directions in whichimprovement is desirable  : the discomfort of out-of-date barracks, inadequate marriedaccommodation, the effect of customs duties on the pay of the soldier which does not goso far as at home, the high cost of his amusements, the few  opportunities of furlough tothe  United Kingdom  during his period of service in India.  I  recognize that themeasures required to remedy these grievances would involve considerable  expenditureof money, the  bulk of which would  fall  on Indian revenues, but  in a paper  dealingwith recruiting I cannot omit reference to conditions in India, because service in india is known to be regarded with considerable disfavour by  the potential recruit.      10. But there is still another and very powerful factor contributing to the decline of  recruiting,  which lies  outside the  control of the Army  Council,  and that  is theprevalent apathy of the public in  general  towards the Army.   I attribute this  to thepacifist agitation,  not so much of those extremists who would dispense with an armyaltogether, but of those who, while recognizing the necessity for an army, do nothing to uphold it in the public estimation, and fail to  appreciate the consequence of allowingit to dwindle until it is unequal to the demands which are made upon  it.  This influenceis reinforced by the writings of ill-informed and  partisan critics  to  the effect that theArmy is obsolete and moribund.
236     11.  If I  have succeeded in convincing  my  colleagues of the vital  necessity  of altering  the recruiting  situation very much for the better, I appeal  to them for their assistance in dispelling the indifference, of the people of this country towards the Army,and awakening them to the dangers of allowing the present situation to continue.   TheArmy Council are taking certain measures, with the help of the Press and the  film industry, to bring life in the Army before the public.  They will  do everything theycan to break down the barrier which has long  existed between military institutions and civil lite, and which has in the past too often stood in the way of a proper unstanding of army activities ; in short, their object  is that the people from  whom the  Army  is drawn should  be fully aware of what service in the Army means, bat these steps, thoughuseful, cannot  have full  success without the help of the leaders of religious and political opinion  in support of our voluntary system.  Above all it is necessary that there shouldbe authoritative pronouncements by Ministers of the Crown, which will do more than any-thing else to open the eyes of the public to the danger of allowing our voluntary system of recruiting to fail us. I appeal for this support as a first essential step towards improvement.     12.  I should  also like to take this opportunity of raising the question, which hasbeen at issue between my Department and the Ministry of Labour, of the latter&apos;s policyin regard to the exhibition of  recruiting posters in Employment Exchanges.   that policy is to  allow the Exchanges  to display  posters and to keep a stock of leafletswhich provide information about the Army, but not to display posters which show theadvantages of joining the Forces of the Crown.   The posters which  are permitted arecolourless and often  not conspicuously displayed.  I appreciate the kind  of  criticism that this policy is designed  to  meet, but if  the  Government itself in its  own Officesengaged in finding work for  the unemployed hesitates to recommend young men  tojoin the  Army, can we  be surprised that enlistment in the Army is still  regarded  asthe last  resort in the minds  of many  of the  class from  which it is  desirable to drawrecruits  ?  I  would also draw  attention to the fact that we have in training camps  inthe special areas a number of  men to whom it  is very desirable that the advantages  ofenlistment  should be  made  clear, and yet  our recruiting  staff are debarred  from entering these camps.   It appears to me that our policy should be to encourage theenlistment of  young men for whom  employment in  civil life is not available.   I earnestly recommend these matters to the Minister  of Labour for his reconsideration,and I ask for the active co-operation of all who are concerned with the problems of thespecial areas.     13. I have dealt in this memorandum so far only with the Regular Army, but theTerritorial Army is in no better position.  It is already short of the existing recruitingestablishment of  the  Force by 40,000 men, and this establishment itself is insufficient for the functions which  the Territorial  Army will  be called upon to  discharge in war.     The Territorial Army is  now the  sole means of development of  our Forces in theField, and in addition it has been called upon to assume responsibility for the whole ofthe coast and  anti-aircraft defences of Great Britain ; units for the latter role must  beready in full strength for service on,  or even in  advance  of, mobilization.  No finalfigures  can be given at  the moment of the increase of the peace  establishment of theTerritorial  Army required to  ensure  its readiness for  war, but  taking  the  lowestestimate of this that can at present be made, and adding to it the existing deficiency andthe  estimated run-off (i.e., the  numbers  likely to leave the Territorial Army from  allcauses) during the period ending 31st March,  1940, the average annual requirements inrecruits  for the Territorial Army during this  period is about 42,000.   During the last10 years the average  intake of recruits  has been only 27,800 a year.     14. To sum up the position with regard to recruitment for both the  Regular and territorial  Army is  serious, but I do  not believe it to be desperate. The  present  isplainly  the psychological moment for  a great drive in recruiting  activities.   Thecountry is waking up to the dangers of  the international situation.  Certain financialadvantages for both Armies have recently been announced, and if these are followed  byallusions in speeches  of  Ministers all over  the country  to the need of recruits and the attractions of  Army life, I have no doubt that the  difficulties with which  we are facedwill be surmounted.

Iam commanded by the Army Council to bring to your notice certain factors bearing uponthe difficulty now being experienced in the recruitment and  maintenance of the establishment  ofthe Army.   It is estimated that unless we can improve recruiting we may, in the immediate future,be short of our  annual requirements  by nearly  4,000  recruits per  annum.  Such  a situationnecessitates close  attention  by all Commanders to every question which directly or  indirectly mayeffect recruiting.    2.  I am to point out that this shortage of recruits is due to  many causes, some of which are entirely beyond our control, such as the increase in the scales of unemployment insurance benefit and  public assistance  without  similar increases  in army  emoluments.  Another factor whichmilitates against  recruiting is the apathy of the  public  to  Army matters.  It is  possible to do something to overcome this  apathy  by improved  liaison with the Press, by &quot; at home &quot;  days  atDepots, by displays and by many unofficial contacts.   In  taking steps  of this sort care must beexercised that training  does not suffer  undue curtailment.   Other  contributory causes to theshortage of recruits are receiving the attention of tbe Army Council, e.g., providing greater oppor-tunities for  trade training for  soldiers ; improving the trooping conditions ; improvements  in conditions of comfort in barracks, &amp;c, &amp;c.  There  is, however, one aspect of  the shortage to whichthe Council wish to draw particular attention, namely the somewhat excessive wastage which is atpresent taking place.  Such wastage is suggestive of a measure of dissatisfaction  with conditions inthe Service as compared with those existing in Civil life, and in this respect it should be possible tomake an improvement.    In an annexure are given details of the wastage due  to  discharge  on  compassionate grounds and by purchase, and to desertion, for the first 7 months of  the current financial year as comparedwith 1934 and 1933.   From  these figures it will  be seen that, in every case, the rate-of  wastageshows  a steady increase and that this is  particularly marked in the case of desertion. If the rate of wastage from these three causes is maintained it is  probable that the total general wastage  for this financial year will amount to about 9,000 a very serious loss.    3.  The comparative dissatisfaction with Army life of which this increase in wastage is indicative,is, in the opinion of the  Council, traceable  to  some extent, apart from those  causes which  are outside Army control, to the following     (a) Discipline of an irritating nature.    (b) Unimaginative and irksome training.    (c) Enlistment of men of low category, moral  and physical.    (d) Lack of judgment  in assessment of &quot; character &quot; of time-expired men.    As regards (a). I am to say that, although it is not the intention of the Council-that disciplineis to be in any way relaxed, they are convinced of  the necessity of eradicating from it everythingof an unintelligent or vexatious nature.    As regards (&amp;). Much of the soldier&apos;s  early training must  necessarily entail  repetition and,consequently, a measure of drudgery.   But  even during that phase it should be possible to inter-sperse   what is dull  with useful  work  of  a more  entertaining  nature  and, thereafter, every endeavour should be made to relieve the trained men of boring repetition of subjects in which heis fully efficient.     As regards (c). The Council wish  to emphasize the importance of preventing the enlistment of  men of low category, who are likely to  cause offence to their comrades and to lower the reputation of the Army in the eyes of  the public.   Such men  very often become  thoroughly badsoldiers and bring disgrace on their units, and they are particularly undesirable when drafted togarripons abroad.  Further, such undesirables have the effect of preventing the enlistment of thegood type of man that is required.  Although, by refusal to enlist them, numbers will at the outsetbe slightly reduced, it  may be anticipated that, in the end, such  a  policy  will be productive ofmore  and better-class  recruits.   This  aspect  of   the matter should  be  impressed  upon yourrecruiting staff.     As regards (d). I am to say that cases have come  to notice of the Council of definitely unfairassessments of  character of men  leaving the Colours.     The serious effect which such action has upon the man seeking employment is obvious.  Theresult  is great discontent on the part of the  man  concerned and this  is bound to  react adverselyupon recruiting.     Whilst the Council are fully aware  of the consequence of excessive leniency in the assessment of  character, they consider  that unsympathetic treatment in this respect should be rigorously

The Council do not consider thematter is one for general circulation throughout the Army, and I am, therefore, to request that youwill treat this letter as confidential and refer it only to those who are more immediately concerned.
