THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the  Cabinet.  April  1936.          3 7 8SECRET.                                                         Copy No.   50CP. 104 (36).CABINET.PROPOSED CABINET COMMITTEE ON TRADE AND AGRICULTURE.    Joint Memorandum by President of the Board of Trade and Minister of                         Agriculture and Fisheries.    WE have to negotiate with the  Baltic,  Scandinavian  and other countriesbefore  the  end of this year for a renewal of the trade agreements,  and it isnecessary  to  give  early  consideration  to  certain  outstanding questions  ofagricultural policy.  For many of these countries, especially Denmark, the agri-cultural clauses of the agreements are of vital  importance and it is unnecessary toemphasise their importance to the home producer.    The questions for decision, for  the most part, affect not only  the  foreigncountries immediately concerned, but also the Dominions.    Before  we can  conclude  our negotiations  with foreign  countries or  theDominions,  decisions  will have to be taken on meat, bacon, butter  and cheese,processed milks, eggs and fish.    The general question that will fall for consideration is         To what extent should home production  of the commodities in question    be safeguarded by protective measures and/or subsidies, having regard to    the interests  of the United Kingdom agricultural and fishing industries, of    our export trade and of the consumer ?    In particular, questions such as the following arise     (1)  Should the levy-subsidy principle be applied in the case of butter and           cheese and eggs ?  The Government&apos;s decision to do so in the case of           bacon  and meat has already been  announced.    (2)  To  what extent  can undertakings be given  to foreign  countries with           regard to imports of meat, bacon, butter  and cheese, fish and eggs,           either in regard to duties, levies or quantities ?    (3)  Is  the home producer  to be  protected in  regard  to  imports  from  the           Dominions, and to what extent and by what  means ?    (4)  To what extent should protective measures be coupled with reorganisation           of  the home industry 1    It is true  that in the case of some of these commodities the questions at issueare not at the  moment ripe for final decision.   The report of the ReorganisationCommission for Milk for Great Britain may have an important bearing on policyin regard to butter and cheese imports, and this report will not be available beforeMay at the earliest.   Final  decisions with regard to processed milks cannot betaken until the report of the Import Duties Advisory Committee on the applica-tion for increased duties that is before them is received.  Nevertheless, a numberof important questions in particular those relating to bacon can be consideredforthwith.[13024]
    We suggest that these problems might conveniently be examined in the firstinstance by a small Committee of the Cabinet.   Questions concerning bacon,  onwhich the Board of Trade have been negotiating for some months with  denmark and other foreign countries, would be submitted to the Committee immediately,and those concerning other commodities as the situation develops.         ;\                                                                 W. 11.                                                              -  , W.
