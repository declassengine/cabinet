Memoran&amp;am by the minister for.....Co-ordination of Defence,     In accordance with the request of tile Cabinet at itslast sheeting (Cabinet 24(36), Conclusion 4), I have examined the proposal of the First Lord of  the Admiralty, as set forth in CP.  82(36), and I have shown this Memorandum to theFirst Lord and to the Secretaries  of State for War and Air.     My doubt with regard to this  proposal &quot;was that it was                                   ...inconsistent with what the Established men regard as theirstatus.    I am apprehensive of the  effect even upon theperfectly reliable men who form the great majority of the dockyard IHstablishments, if without the assignment of any reason,  or cause for compliant, an Established man receivednotice of immediate discharge.     Article 49 of:the Dockyard Peculations deals with anumber of breaches of the Dockyard  rules and regulations,                                                        wwsuch as insubordination, turbulence, inebriety and idleness.The Article provides that&quot;workpeople charged with any ofthe offences referred to in this Article are to be given anopportunity of being heard in their own defence beforepunishment is awarded&quot;.   The proposal now is that in caseswhere a departmental Committee is satisfied that an employeehas been, is, or is likely to be engaged in activitiesendangering the safety or interests of the State, he should                          &quot;1-8 S C ri E T.CP.  5 4(56).
                                                                   1Sj Whitehall Gardens, S.W.l9                                       !,    Slst March, 1936.                                              [be immediately discharged if the Cabinet Minister so decides,and that no information should be given either to the man orto Parliament if the dismissal is there challenged.   I am informed that it is not proposed to alter the terms ofArticle 49 or the analogous articles in the other Services.having regard, to the language of Article 4-9, I think thiscourse might be plausibly defended on the ground that the employee is only entitled to be told the charge in the casesmentioned, in the Article.   I am not sure, however, that thiswould, allay any feeling among the Dockyard men which might arise, and. it must be realised that unless the man inquestion is told what the cause of his discharge is, he willbe entitled to assume it is an Article 49 case.   I do notthink it is possible to put a workman&apos;s representative onthe Co2:xnittee, having regard to the necessity for secrecyas to tne source of the information.     It is hoped, I understand, that if the proposed method    A,;;: [; --\S            ..     .                      .    &apos;is used, with care, there will be no complaint from theTrades Unions or from the dockyard men themselves.   In      1the circumstances only experience can show whether&quot; this hope 1is well founded.                                             1      .  &apos;1 : i             :   &apos;;.           ,      .V&apos;:&apos;&apos;.&apos;.      &apos;, ;    ;j :  ;&apos;. !:&apos;. 11                                (Intdo) T.W.H.I.
