THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  April 1936.3 3 6CONFIDENTIAL.Copy No.CP. 98 (36).(Revise.)CABINET.ANGLO-EGYPTIAN  TREATY.    I CIRCULATE  to  my colleagues a further telegram from His Majesty-sHigh Commissioner for Egypt and the reply which has been sent to Sir miles lampson on the subject of the preliminary conversations on the military aspectsof an Anglo-Egyptian treaty.  In case the further efforts of Sir Miles Lampson,in accordance with the instructions just sent to him, fail to move the leader of theEgyptian  delegation,  I seek from my colleagues a decision  whether I  can  beauthorised to instruct Sir Miles Lampson, at the moment I consider opportune, toforeshadow the evacuation by  British troops of Abbassia and Helmia in  favourof Helouan  or  some equally central locality  as  a means of  securing Egyptianconsent to the continued posting of British troops at Alexandria or in the neigh-bourhood  of  that city.  My  colleagues will remember that in the originalinstructions  sent  to Sir  Miles Lampson the maximum concession  which HisMajesty&apos;s  Government could  make was stated as being the evacuation of Abbassiaand Helmia (as  well as of the Kasr-el-Nil barracks and the Citadel), British forcesbeing withdrawn  to Helouan  (or some  equally central and more  technicallysuitable point),  and remaining in the Canal Zone and at or near Alexandria.  this concession was  not to  be mentioned to the Egyptian delegation without priorreference in good time to His  Majesty&apos;s Government.(No.  247.  Important.)(Telegraphic.)                                      Cairo, March 26, 1936.    MY telegram No. 245.    We have now submitted all our arguments to Nahas Pasha for retention of[ ? Abbasia] and Helmia (stage B of your telegram No. 94)  and of the neighbour-hood of Alexandria and for our requirements in regard to  training facilities forair and ground troops.  We have also explained our desiderata in regard to theuse of ports by the navy.  Nahas Pasha has, on his side, offered the establishmentof British military mission on a most generous scale and  has advanced beyond1930 draft on the following points :     (1) Principle of increased numbers in Canal Zone.    (2) Improvements in communications according to specifications of military          mission.    (3) Air facilities.    (4) Training grounds south of Ismailia Railway.A. E.Foreign Office, March 30, 1936.ANNEX.[J 2598/2/16]Sir M. Lampson to Mr. Eden. (Received 3d arch 26.)8509  [12986]   [13025]
    2.  My impression is that we can  make  no further progress as regardsAbbasia and Helmia and  that the time has now come to advance to stage C anddevote our whole efforts to Helouan, Alexandria and extended training facilities.(I do not  anticipate much difficulty over naval requirements.)  Danger must bebdimesin mind that Wafd may be less than obliging after the  elections and weshould therefore crystallise  our essential  demands for the consideration of thewhole Egyptian delegation fairly  soon.   May I therefore be authorised ,a-s soonas possible to transfer the  discussions to stage C at the appropriate moment?    3.  As regards the question of numbers, I understand that we  require either(a) the right to reinforce  our Canal Zone troops at our discretion, or (b) a very high maximum in that zone.  It would be very helpful if I could be informed  what our limit would be if (b) should appear most easy to obtain. [J 2598/2/16]                    Mr.  Eden to Sir M. Lampson (Cairo). (No. 157.  Important.) (Telegraphic.)                      Foreign Of/ice, March 28, 1936, 3-30 P.M.     YOUR telegram No.  247 of 26th March :  Military talks.     I do not quite like idea of falling back so quickly to stage &quot; C,&quot; even though this may later become inevitable.  Before we do so, however, could you not make one more try to discuss with Egyptians principle of &quot; pooling &quot;  arrangements? Egyptians appear rather to have run out of the course (when you  first mentioned matter) by chasing details. I would prefer them to fit the details to the principle rather than to fit the principle to the details.  Moreover, if (as  he has already shown himself ready to do) Nahas Pasha makes concessions over and above 1930 draft, might he not  in the end be glad to appeal to principle of  &apos;&apos; pooling&apos;&apos; in order to justify concessions in eyes of his own people?     Your recent  telegrams  give the impression that  Nahas  Pasha,  though obstinate, has, under the influence of your arguments, shown  some disposition to advance slightly.  This makes me think that continued hammering might move him further.  Even if  you are convinced, then, that it is now too late to returnto discussion of  &quot;pooling&quot;  proposal, I would prefer that you  should for themoment harp on Alexandria (by this I do not necessarily mean Alexandria itself, but neighbourhood) and in case of deadlock explain to Nahas that  you must refer to me.  I will  then  be  prepared  to raise subject of Egypt at  next meeting of Cabinet  and to  inform you subsequently  how far  you may use  stage  &quot;  C &quot; (evacuation  of  Abbassia  and Helmia)  as bargaining counter  for securing Alexandria.     Question of numbers see your final paragraph is being examined further and I will address you. again as soon as circumstances permit.
