Copy No. 3COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCEExtract from the DRAFT Minutes of the 276th Meeting, held on April 3, 1936.  (1) STAFF  CONVERSATIONS  WITH  THE  LOCARNO POWERS.                        (C.I.D. Paper No. 1224-B.)    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum by the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Committee on the subject of the forthcoming  Staff conversations with the Locarno Powers (C.I.D. Paper No.  1224-B).    MR.  EDEN said that, in connection  with the subject under discussion, theFrench Ambassador had asked oh the previous day if we were in a position tosay when the Conversations could begin.  The Belgian Ambassador had made an unofficial suggestion that the Conversations might begin in the form of a meeting with the Service attaches of France and Belgium.  He  thought this suggestion was valuable, although it might be found that it was not acceptable to the French.The proposed general scope of the Conversations as defined in Section III of theWhite Paper (Cmd. 5134) had been agreed upon, as also  the stipulation conveyedby a letter to the French and Belgian Ambassadors that the  contact between theGeneral Staffs was not to be understood as giving rise in respect of  any Govern-ment concerned to any political undertaking, nor to any obligation regarding theorganisation of national defence.   The proposal that the meeting should be heldin London had been accepted by the French and Belgian Ambassadors.    SIR THOMAS INSKIP questioned whether the footnote at the bottom ofthe first page of CJ.D, Paper No. 1224-B gave a correct reference.  That footnotereferred  to  an undertaking to establish or continue the contact  between theGeneral Staffs in the event of failure of the efforts for conciliation, whereas the paragraph in the Chiefs of  Staff Memorandum to which the footnote was appended dealt with the possibility of subsequent Conversations in connectionwith possible later mutual assistance pacts, open to all the signatories, including&apos;Germany (see also below).    SIR  ERNLE CHATFIELD confirmed that the  Chiefs  of  Staff in the paragraph referred to  were dealing with  ultimate  Conversations, not  thoseimmediately contemplated or those which might take place if efforts at concilia-tion failed.  The Chiefs of Staff  had taken the view that the scope of immediateConversations must not be such as to prejudice later  Conversations under mutual assistance pacts,  as they would do if too  much detail regarding plans  were introduced.  This point had been dealt with in paragraph 6 of the Memorandum.It was  important that our representatives should be  fully cognizant of theposition described in the Annex to the Chiefs of Staff Memorandum, dealing withthe condition of our Forces to  meet the  possibility  of war  with Germany,observing especially the  handicap placed upon us by our  existing responsibilities in the Mediterranean. ^[ME. RAMSAY MACDONALD entered the Meeting at&apos; this point..]  [13023-1]
      SIR THOMAS IN SKIP said that the footnote did not affect the substance of the Memorandum.  The position might be summarised as follows :       Under Section III (second paragraph) of the White  Paper (Cmd. 5134) the General  Staffs  would have  to  consider  arrangements  to meet the  case  of unprovoked aggression.      Under Section VII  mutual  assistance  pacts  were contemplated at  a  later stage under which technical arrangements would be necessary for the preparation of such measures as would ensure the effective execution of the obligations under- taken.      On page 7 of the same White Paper in paragraph 1 (d) of the draft letter therein quoted,  the  possibility was raised of  Conversations which would only take place if negotiations for a settlement were to fail.      For the moment we  were only concerned with the first of  the above, and it was  clear that  any  instructions  given  would have to  be very  precise.  The question immediately to  be  determined was the field  which those  Conversations should be allowed to cover, i.e., whether they should be confined to  a statement of what Forces might be made available,  always provided the  Government  were to authorise their use,  or whether  they should cover a  wider field and deal  with joint plans.     SIR ERNLE CHATFIELD  said that the Joint Planning Sub-Committee had been instructed to consider the possible forms which the  Conversations might take and had suggested that they might take one or more of the following :        (i) a strict limitation to an exchange of information as to the Forces likely           to be available;      (ii) a  discussion as to the  facilities which we  require to implement our           co-operation, e.g., ports, rolling-stock, aerodromes, &amp;c.;     (hi) a complete  inter-change of war plans. He himself was much against the third alternative and he thought that the first alternative would be sufficient to establish that Conversations  were actually taking place.     In the course of the subsequent discussion it was pointed  out that the military Conversations which we had held with  the French last Autumn  had been  limited to an examination of the  immediate situation as it  then existed,  and this  formed a useful precedent.   The French at the time had said that  they were unable to deal  adequately with the possibility of hostilities with Italy for some  months and We could take the same line and explain that, owing to the Mediterranean situation (which our representatives would have to assume was to  continue) we were now  similarly  limited  at  the  present time. Whether decisions  by the Government might be made in the future which  relieved us of some of those responsibilities, was not a matter for the Staffs even to discuss  with the  French and Belgians.   Our  representatives,  therefore, should clearly  understand that their discussions were to  be  limited to  the situation as it  existed at the present time.     It was pointed out, moreover, that  although we might  explain  to the  Frenchand Belgians the size of the  forces which we could make available, that was not to be understood as a guarantee that those forces would, in  fact, be despatched. The  form  and  extent of our contribution  was necessarily  a  matter for  His Majestj^s Government to decide when the time came,  we  could  not give  any undertaking in  advance.  But it could be said that if a decision  were reachedto send forces overseas, in vieAV of our present naval  position in Home waters,we should require the cover of the French Fleet.   Moreover,  the role of such forces must be confined to the defence of the French and  Belgian frontier in the eventof unprovoked aggression.    It might be that the  French  were  regarding these Conversations largely as :&apos; window-dressing &apos;&apos; for their electorate, but  that could not be assumed, and theywould very likely urge us to improve our  strategical position in every possible. way,  including a certain amount of withdrawal from the Mediterranean.   This..however, as recorded previously during the meeting, was  entirely  a matter for political decision.    THE COMMITTEE then turned  to the consideration of draft conclusionsprepared by the Secretary as a basis of discussion,  which,  in an amended form,are quoted in the conclusions  to this minute.
     It  was recognised that the  French and Belgians might be  disagreeablysurprised at the information we had to convejr;  nevertheless, it was  thought desirable that the exact position should be  described, although undue emphasisneed not  be laid on our  deficiencies.   If  they wished to know the  position regarding our reserves  of  men and  material, it might be  imparted to them, atleast in general terms.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN pointed out that pressure would probably be broughtto  bear upon the  Government  before very long for  the publication  of theinstructions to our  representatives, and he thought this fact should be borne inmind.   It  should also  be clearly understood that  for the purpose  of  these conversations,  &quot; unprovoked aggression &quot;  should  be  taken as confined to the-actual crossing of the frontier.     SIR JOHN  SIMON agreed.  The French might ask what our action wouldbe in the event of a German massing of troops and an anticipated attack.  Ifsuch a question were raised our representatives should refuse to discuss it.  he recalled the Staff Conversations  which took place prior to 1914, and  althoughit was quite true that those Conversations had not committed us to participation in the Great War,  yet,  as  a result of them,  the French had made certain navalredistributions, on  the assumption of the part which  British forces were likelyto play.  We  should be careful in these forthcoming  negotiations to avoid any possibility of  our being committed in advance  by any agreement arrived at,however indirectly.                                CONCLUSIONS.     THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed      1.  That the suggestion that Conversations should be begun with the Service           Attaches to  the French and Belgian Embassies in London should be           adopted, subject to the agreement of the  other Governments concerned.     2.  The scope  of the  Conversations should be as  follows :             (a) The Conversations must be  confined to the subject  set  forth in                 Section III of the  proposals drawn up b)^ the representatives of                 France, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Italy, at London, on                 the 19th March, 1936 (Cmd. 5134,  page 3), under which the                 said representatives undertook :                       &quot; Forthwith to instruct their General Staffs to  enter into                 contact with a view to arranging the technical conditions in                 which the obligations which are  binding upon them should be                 carried out in case of unprovoked aggression.&quot;                 In  other words,  the Conversations  must  be  limited to our                 existing  obligations under the  Locarno  Treaty  to come to the                 assistance of France and Belgium in the event of an unprovoked                 act of aggression by reason of the crossing of the frontier.           (&amp;) The  Conversations must  not  be  allowed   to  extend  to para-                 graph 1 (d) of the  letter sent  to  the   French and  Belgian                 Governments of the 2nd April.   That article provides that His                 Majesty&apos;s Government will establish or continue contact between                 the General Staffs contemplated in Section III quoted above for                 the purpose  of ensuring   the security of France or  Belgium                 against unprovoked  aggression, but only comes into operation                 &quot;if the  effort  of  conciliation attempted in the arrangements                 there proposed should fail.&quot;   In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s                 Government the effort of  conciliation has not failed, and the                 undertaking is therefore not operative.           (c) The representatives of the Staffs should be  empowered to discuss                 technical matters only.  It has already been agreed between the                 Governments:                       &quot; That this contact between the General Staffs cannot give                 rise in respect of either  Government to any political under-                 taking,  nor to any  obligation regarding the organisation of                 national defence.&quot;
             The question whether  British naval, military or air  forces             should be increased is a  political  question  outside  the  Staff             Conversations.       (d) The representatives of the Staffs must  bear  in mind and make             clear  in  the course  of  the Conversations that His  Majesty&apos;s             Government reserve  full  liberty to  decide  what fOrm  their             assistance  should take, and  that  they themselves  have  no-             authority to undertake  any naval, military or air commitment.       (e) Subject to the  above, they  should be given authority :               (i)  To exchange information  with  the  representatives of the-                    French and Belgian Staffs as to the defence forces and                    defences which, subject to the decision of the respective                    Governments  concerned,  would  be available  for the                    contingency under consideration.             (ii)  To  arrange  for   a   general  exchange   of  information                    regarding ports and other facilities.3.  That the Minister for  Co-ordination  of Defence, in consultation with the-       Ministers at the head of the Defence Services,  should draft instruc-       tions for the representatives of the Service Staffs designated to take       part in the Conversations.4.  To note that the Secretary of State for  Foreign Affairs hoped to be able       to arrange that the initial Conversations  with the  Service  Attaches       would be postponed until after Easter, but that it might be necessary       for the first meeting to be held on Wednesday, the 8th April.5.  That the meeting with the Service Attaches should take place preferably       not at  the Foreign Office,  but possibly either  in the Admiralty  or       possibly at 2 Whitehall Gardens.    it                      ij*           -y-           -y-           Ji.    -r?          vr          w           -7t*                       -ft2  Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,        April 3,  1936.

TO BE  KEPT  UNDER LOCK  AND KEY.STAFF CONVERSATIONS  WITH  THE  LOCARNO&apos; POWERS.             Memorandum by  the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.    IN view of the&apos; current proposals that there should be Staff conversations between the Locarno Powers, we desire to submit some preliminary observations on this subject.    2.   The position is complicated by the possibility  that there may be two sets of such Conversations.   The first set,  as now contemplated  under  Section III ofthe White Paper (Cmd. 5134),  would take place between ourselves, France andBelgium, but at the moment presumably would exclude Italy.  There may, further,be a subsequent  set of Conversations^ with  a view  to possible later mutual assistance pacts which would be open to all the signatories, including Germany.In this connection, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs made the following statement in the House  of Commons :          &quot; Those mutual assistance pacts,  which I must emphasise,  would,  of    course, be open to all the signatories of Locarnp I  am talking now of the    permanent settlement we wish to reach, not of the temporary arrangement    to restore confidence open to all  the signatories, including Germany, would    be supplemented by Staff Convereations on exactly the same lines and with    the same limitations as I have stressed before.  The general  scheme of this    central part of our  proposal is very much like the scheme of the Air Pact,    which has been under discussion for some time past.&quot;    3.   We have always  seen  difficulties in carrying out  Staff  conversations with the French and Belgians on one  hand and with Germany on  the other/andin our  Report of  February 1935  on the Air Pact  (Paper No.  C.O.S.  364,paragraph 15) we said :           &quot; This raises the  difficulty that Conversations with France alone would    be unfair to the other  signatories, and Conversations with  all signatories    would clearly be out of the question,&quot;   * Under the provisions of paragraph 1 (d) of the draft letter on page 7 of the same white paper.       [13007]
     4.  The point is that Staff  Conversations will almost inevitably entail  the disclosure of detailed war plans for purposes of co-ordination, and neither Francenor Germany is in the least likely to disclose her plans to us when she knows thatwe are carrying on. or have carried on, similar Conversations with other parties,and  there is no certainty as to the side on which we might be fighting.     5.  We adhere to the view which we have quoted above.  The point arises in connection  with  the  preliminary conversations  now contemplated with  the locarno Powers,  other  than Germany,  for  the  reason  that such preliminaryconversations may prejudice  the possibility or usefulness of later negotiationsfor Military and Air Pacts in which Germany would be included.     6.  We think it clear that full and  unrestricted  preliminary conversations with France and Belgium are, in these circumstances, out of the question, andthat it  is essential that  the Conversations immediately to be undertaken shouldbe strictly limited in  their scope in order to prejudice  the future  as little  aspossible.  The instructions given to the Staffs  should be very precise on thispoint.     7.  We have  already reported  on the condition  of our forces to meet thepossibility of Avar  with Germany.  This Report (Paper No. CCS. 442) has been laid  before the Cabinet, but has not been circulated to the Committee of ImperialDefence, and we,  therefore, attach a copy to this Memorandum.  A  perusal  ofthat Report will show how defenceless is this country so long as a large proportionof our naval, military  and air forces is locked up in the Mediterranean; indeed,it may be said that until the Mediterranean situation is cleared up Conversationsare of little practical value as a  means of assessing our effective contribution  tothe allied cause.  The naval  position, for  instance, is such that if we became involved in  war at the present time with  Germany, even if we at once mobilised,the defence  of  our coasts and of  our trade would mainly fall upon French naval forces,  and the  Battle Cruisers  would  have  to  be  withdrawn  from theMediterranean, thereby  jeopardising our Mediterranean security.  If we are seriously to  consider the  possibility of war with Germany,  it is essential that theServices should be relieved of  their Mediterranean responsibilities, otherwise ourposition is utterly  unsafe.     8.  It may be argued that Conversations carried out at the present time willat least open the eyes of the French to the  weakness of our position  and induce them to hold their hand.  But that cannot be taken  for granted.  The mere factthat  Conversations have  taken place may encourage the French, who will assume.with justice, that  we are morally committed to them.  If they  think  that theyare strong enough at the present time to  undertake  hostilities against Germany,we may find ourselves committed to participation with forces which are not onlyinadequate to render effective support, but incapable of assuring our own securitywith grave consequences  to the people of this country.     9.  Finally, if Staff  Conversations are decided upon  in the near future,  as contemplated in Section  III of the White Paper, we think there are  advantages in their taking place in London rather than in Brussels and Paris.  But if thisis not possible,  Brussels would be  preferable to Paris.                    (Signed)      ERNLE  CHATFIELD.                                   A. A.

[C.O.S. 442]                                 ANNEX THE CONDITION, OF OUR FORCES TO MEET THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR WITH GERMANY.             Memorandum by the Chiefs  of Staff Sub-Committee.     IN view of the gravity of the position  resulting from the German occupation of the Demilitarised Zone, we met on the 12th March, 1936, without instructions but with the  knowledge  and approval of the Prime Minister, to examine the military aspects of the situation.  We subsequently directed the Joint Planning Sub-Committee to review the  condition of our forces and to  render a  Report at once on the existing position of our defence  forces at Home and the possible- improvements  which  could be achieved  by mobilisation either  with  or  without at  the  same time being  relieved of our  present  extra responsibilities  in the Mediterranean.  Their Report, as amended and approved by us, is attached to this Memorandum.    2.   We realise that the main object of the Governments policy  is to avoid any risk of war with Germany.  In case, however, there is the smallest risk, either now or  later in the negotiations,  that we  might be drawn  into such a war, we wish to offer the  following observations :     3.   The attached Report gives the facts regarding the forces at our disposal in certain circumstances,  and we would at once emphasise, as is obvious from those facts, that any question of war with Germany while we were as at present heavily committed to  the  possibility of hostilities  in the  Mediterranean  would  be thoroughly  dangerous.   As regards naval  operations against  Germany,  our minimum requirements could only be carried out by weakening naval forces in the Mediterranean to an  extent which  would jeopardise our  position there vis-a-vis Italy.  Even  so, there would not  be sufficient  naval forces available to ensure that  we could safeguard our coasts  or trade against serious depredations of the German Fleet,  small as it  is.  As regards the Army and the  Air  Force, the purely defensive provisions already made in the Mediterranean have drawn upon  the resources of these  two Services to such an  extent  that until those reinforcements have returned  to this country we should be quite incapable of despatching a Field Force or providing any proper defence in the air.  To bring Home these forces with  their  equipment,  reserves of ammunition and the like would take in the case of the Army two months after the orders for withdrawal are given, and even longer in the  case of the Air Force.    4.  We also  draw attention to the fact that the provision of equipment for the defence  of our coasts and ports at Home has to date,  with the  consent of the Government, been placed in the lowest  category of importance, and it is only with the approval of the new programme for the  reconditioning of the  forces that a serious start is being made to rectify matters in this direction.   At the moment our coast defence artillery requires modernisation to a large extent, we have no anti-submarine defences for a number of our most important ports, and the number of our anti-aircraft guns  and searchlights is quite inadequate to deal with the air threat from German)7.  Even if  the reserves of ammunition at present  in  the Mediterranean were withdrawn, the situation would be little improved.    5.   The  modified  naval position  in  the Mediterranean discussed in  the attached Report involving the adoption of  a strict defensive may be feasible but not, in our opinion,  a proper  strategical step to take.  It  would leave Italian naval forces free to operate in the Central Mediterranean  and would probably discourage other Mediterranean  Powers  from co-operation in  the  event of hostilities.   In any case,  even with this modified naval policy, the present army and air forces  in the Mediterranean must  remain if there  is any clanger  to be antcipated from Italy and, consequently, there would be little improvement in theposition  at Home.                      .....,,..........-...........    6.   Therefore, if  there  is the smallest  danger of being  drawn into commit--merits which might lead  to  war with Germany, we  ought at once to disengageourselves from our present responsibilities in  the Mediterranean, which  have      [13007 I                                                     n &apos;2*J fS3o3
exhausted practically the whole of our meagre forces.  Even then, a considerable period of time must elapse, varying from two to four months as regards the Armyand the Air Force, before those forces willbe re-established at Home.    7.  In the absence of  instructions we are not submitting any definite pro-posals, but we feel that the information in this Memorandum and in the attached report ought to be available to the Government.

THE CONDITION  OF OUR  FORCES  TO MEET THE  POSSIBILITY                       OF WAR WITH GERMANY.                 Report  by the  Joint Planning Sub-Committee. [Amended and approved by the Chiefs of Staff at their 168th Meeting held on                               March 17, 1936.]                                 Introduction.     THE Chiefs of Staff at their meeting* held on the 12th March, 1936, directed the Joint Planning Sub-Committee to review the position and to prepare a Report in fairly general terms setting forth       (i)  the existing position of our defence forces at Home;      (ii)  the improvement which would result from mobilisation;     (iii)  the effects if, in addition, the Services were relieved of  their present           extra responsibilities in the Mediterranean.     2.  We have, in particular,  considered our position, under the three headings given above,  as regards the Air Defence of Great Britain, the possible despatch of an Expeditionary Force overseas, the defence of  trade  and defence against sporadic bombardment of our coasts.   We have dealt also with the amount of naval support likely to be available from France.               Present Position of the Defence Forces at Home.     3.  At  the  present  moment  our dispositions  are directed  against  the possibility of a war with Italy in the Mediterranean, and our naval and air forces at Home are denuded to an extent almost unparalleled in the past.  The despatch of military reinforcing units to Egypt  has  resulted in a situation which will prevent us from  sending overseas  any further  formations of any kind without mobilisation.     4.  The  present positions in more detail  as regards each of the Defence Services is as follows :  Navy.     5.  The only naval forces immediately available in home Waters are         1 6-inch Cruiser (48 hours&apos; notice),       17 Destroyers,  of Avhich only 4 are modern vessels, and        9 Submarines (3-7 days&apos; notice).Without mobilisation or withdrawal of ships from the Mediterranean no other forces can be made available, except a further&quot; 5 destroyers and 1  submarine, whichcould be ready in about a week.                      *  CO.S./166th Meeting, Minute 1.
     6.  It is clear from the above  that we have at present  no naval forces in home waters which could take any effective action to protect  our trade routes orto prevent German forces bombarding our coasts.     7.  Naval forces can, however, be very rapidly redisposed in emergency, andif forces can be spared from the Mediterranean they can be  made available for trade protection and other work at Home in a period of about 3^ days for vesselsat Gibraltar, and 7 days for vessels in the Eastern Mediterranean.   The onlyforces which can be withdrawn without seriously affecting our position in theMediterranean are the following from  Gibraltar :              1 battle cruiser.             1 6-inch  cruiser.             1 flying boat squadron.     8.  The French coasts  and trade would also be  open to attack, and  until we could redispose our forces the French Atlantic Squadron could expect no help from us in protecting  her vital routes and our own.     9.  The greater part of the boom defence and similar material intended forthe defence of our ports at Home has been sent to the Mediterranean, and sufficientonly is in England to  equip two ports to a  small extent.     10.  All available A.A. ammunition has been sent to the Mediterranean and very little remains at  Home-new production  is not yet available on any scale.Other ammunition reserves for certain ships have been sent  abroad, but thesituation in this respect is not so serious as  for A.A. ammunition.Army.     11.  As regards  the Field Force, the despatch of the reinforcing units tothe Middle  East and  in  particular of  R.A.S.C.,  E.A.M.C.,  and R.A.O.C., hasresulted, as  already stated, in a position which  prevents us from despatching anyfurther formations of  any kind overseas without mobilisation.Coast Defence.     12.  In  the present  naval situation the Coast  Defences, which are also  a territorial  responsibility, are generally satisfactory.   Strengths are low but should suffice  for  immediate  manning, not for prolonged  operations.   Twosomewhat weak aspects of  the coast defence situation  are the  absence of anydefence at Scapa Flow, and  of up-to-date A.M.T.B. organisation at some ports.     13.  Some A.A. defence exists  for  all defended ports from Milford Havensouth about to Harwich.  These represent a total of  16 guns and 25 searchlightswhich would be quite  insufficient for defence.Internal Security.     14.  There  is practically no  Royal Defence Corps  personnel available toprovide for internal security and to guard vulnerable points.  About five battalionsare required.   In  general,  however, the situation as regards internal securitywould not be serious since the  Regular troops  which could not  be sent overseascould meet requirements with the assistance of  the Territorial Army.Air Force.    15.   The defensive measures undertaken lately have  not only resulted in thedespatch of  a total of  14-^ squadrons and 3  maintenance units from England tothe Middle East together with adequate reserves for  those squadrons, but alsothe creation of  new headquarter units and a considerable increase in the size of normal staffs in that area.  This has seriously depleted the Service units remainingat Home and has made serious inroads on our resources in personnel and equip-ment. Until the deficiencies  in equipment despatched are  made good by deliveries from contractors, such  aircraft as remain at Home cannot be considered as fully equipped for war operations.    16.   The steps which have been taken  to  implement  the expansion of theRoyal Air Force which was approved last April have necessarily resulted  in aconsiderable disorganisation of Home units owing to the temporary employment      [13007]                                                     B 3
 of certain first-line squadrons on training duties, and the withdrawal of trained personnel to act as instructors at Flying Training Schools and to form the nucleus of new squadrons.     17.  As a result of the above factors, the total metropolitan  strength of the Royal  Air Force in first-line aircraft to-day gives  no true indication of  the immediate  operational effort which could be  produced in a sudden emergency. This would be very much less than appears at first sight to be possible, and would, in fact, provide only a fraction of the offensive and defensive  effort required. However, given a short period of preparation even without mobilization the position  shown  in  paragraph  18  below could be  achieved.   This period  of preparation is  required in  order  to amalgamate  existing first-line  aircraft, trained flying and  maintenance personnel,  and stocks of ancillary equipment collected from various sources, into effective operational units backed by a supply organisation.     18.  It is estimated that 21 days after the order to prepare,  it would  be possible to provide squadrons for tasks as follows :       (i) Home Defence Fighters: 6  squadrons.             But of  these,  2 squadrons would be equipped with an obsolescent         type of aircraft which would be of  little practical value  against the         bombers which Germany could employ, and 2 squadrons with another         type which cannot operate at night.     (ii) Air Striking Force: 4 Light Bomber  Squadrons.                             3 Heavy Bomber Squadrons.             Of these, the  4 Light Bomber Squadrons  have insufficient range         to operate  effectively from  bases in  this country,  and could not be         despatched to  operate  from  Continental  bases  without mobilisation.         The 3  Heavy Bomber Squadrons could reach the Ruhr-Rhine area of         Germany  from  Home  Bases, and  could produce an  initial effort of         approximately 25 tons of bombs per day for a short period.     (iii)  Coastal  Reconnaissance  and Naval  Co-operation:  1  Flying Boat           Squadron.             This squadron would be equipped with  an  old type of flying boat         with less range than those now  in the Mediterranean  (but see para-         graph 7).     (iv) Army Co-operation: 2 Squadrons.             Note.-All the above squadrons would be backed by a 100 per cent.         war reserve of aircraft.     The above total of available first-line air forces would be  utterly inadequate for Home Defence in a war against Germany even at the present stage of  thelatter&apos;s armament programme.Air Defence of Great Britain.     19.  For the Air Defence of Great Britain it would be possible  to man  notmore than 33^ per cent, of that portion of the  Defence System considered essential for the protection of London alone.  Out of the six Squadrons available for thispurpose, two would be of very doubtful operational value by day,  and a furthertwo would be useless  for defence by  night.   Our potentialities  for immediatecounter air offensive action would be limited  to a  maximum  of thirty heavy bomber aircraft.     20.  The situation as regards A.A. guns and lights  is, generally speaking,-equally unsatisfactory, nor would it be improved by  mobilisations, since it is  a territorial  Army responsibility.   Sufficient lights are available to light  thefighting zone to  the same extent as that for which fighter aircraft are available.This means an  illuminated zone some 12 miles deep for a  frontage of about40 miles.  The outer artillery zone is  incompletely covered;  the position in  the inner artillery zone is prejudiced by a shortage of searchlights and there is ashortage of A.A. ammunition.
     21.  In addition, about 500 A.A. Lewis Guns of the Eastern Command are available for protection against low-flying attack, but Lewis Guns are of  small value except for the possible moral effect of their presence on the population. There are also in the United Kingdom some Regular A.A.  units which, if  made available,  would represent  a reinforcement of some  8 guns and 36 searchlights in various degrees of training,  but this contribution would not materially alter the situation.     22.  We understand  that  our  position  regarding  passive  air defence measures is being reviewed in the Air Raid Precautions Department of the Home Office.            Situation in the event of Mobilisation being Authorised.     23.  If mobilisation were  authorised, but  at the same time  it were not possible to bring back from  the Mediterranean area  any forces  at present there, the position would be as follows :  Navy.     24.  The following vessels  could be  made available in a  period of about 14 days:               3 Battleships.              1 Aircraft Carrier.             2 7 - 5-inch-gun Cruisers.              8 6-inch-gun Cruisers.             15 Destroyers.     A list of ships at more than  14 days&apos; notice at Home is given in Appendix I.     25.  The above forces  together with those immediately available (see para- graph 5) are not sufficient for the requirements of a war with Germany, especially in respect of light craft, and the security of the British Isles and our trade routescould not be assured by these forces alone.  Further, such forces would be quite inadequate to provide  the escorts  required, should an Expeditionary Force be despatched to the Continent. Army.     26. Assuming mobilisation, the following force  could be organised in three weeks as a Field  Force  for despatch overseas :       Corps HQ., certain Corps Troops and Two Divisions.     27. This force would be without its Air Defence Brigade and any tank units.The units would be largely on a horsed basis, there would be no anti-tank weapons or infantry mortars.  Artillery ammunition would be  available for 4 months only on a European war basis.  A base and line of communication organisation could be provided  for an Air Striking Force (vide para. 30), as well  as for the Field Force.     28.  The  position  regarding  A.D.G.B.  and  Coast   Defence   would  beunchanged.Air Force.     29.  Assuming that mobilisation is authorised and that no air forces are brought back from the Middle East area, the total possible addition to our first-lineair strength  at Home would be 1 Home Defence Fighter Squadron and  2 LightBomber Squadrons.  The additional fighter  squadron would, however, be equipped with the same obsolescent type of aircraft as the 2 squadrons referred to inparagraph 18 (i) above.     30.  We should also be  in a position, 7 days after mobilisation, to  commencethe despatch abroad of the Light Bomber squadrons included in the insignificantair striking force referred to in paragraph 18 (ii), and the 2 Army Co-operationSquadrons,  together with a  technical maintenance organisation.   The  rate ofdespatch  would  depend  on the availability  of  shipping.   Any  contingentdespatched to Continental bases would, however, have to be dependent upon ArmySources of non-technical suppty and Service.
Situation in the Event of Mobilisation and the Adoption of a Defensive Attitude                           in the Mediterranean.    31.  In these circumstances, the position as regards naval readiness becomessomewhat different from that of the Army and Air Force.  It would be possibleto change the naval  strategy and  plans in the Mediterranean to release certainnaval forces  for  operations in Home Waters.   Present strategy  against Italyenvisages control of the Central Mediterranean area with a view to exerting themaximum pressure on Italy, and our present dispositions are made  to this end.    32.  We could, however, decide to hold only the ends of the Mediterranean,thus cutting  Italy off from the world outside that sea, in  particular, from EastAfrica;  and to abandon any attempt at complete control of the central area.    33.  The result of this strategy would be that an Italian war, if it took place,would be prolonged,  and Malta might be captured, but our vital interests wouldbe unaffected and final victory in the war with Italy would remain certain.    34.  If this  strategy were  adopted, the following  forces could be  released from the Mediterranean &quot;for service in Home Waters :               1 Battleship,             2 Battle Cruisers,             2 8-inch Cruisers,             1 6-inch Cruiser,            28 Destroyers,             4 Submarines, and             1 net layer.    35.  This  force,  together  with that  which  would  be available aftermobilisation  (see paragraph 24), should enable us to provide reasonable security for our trade routes and the British  Isles, provided that unrestricted submarine warfare was not adopted, though it  would not be sufficient  to prevent  sporadicattack on either, even by the small  forces that Germany at present possesses.    36.  If Germany  did adopt unrestricted warfare, it would be essential forall available A/S craft to return from the Mediterranean, that  is to say, we could not longer remain ready for war with Italy in  the Mediterranean.    37.  If  the  forces mentioned in paragraph 34  were  withdrawn,  certainreserves of ammunition, stores, &amp;c, would have to be withdrawn too.    38.  With a defensive  strategy in  the  Mediterranean,  it would  only benecessary to consider the A/S protection of the harbours of Gibraltar, Alexandriaand Haifa (and possibly Port Said).    39.  We have at present a large amount of boom material available in theMediterranean afloat for possible  use at advanced bases which could be released and brought Home.  This material, together with that  already available at Home,would- be sufficient for the seaward defences of  our four  most important navalports.    40.  A change in  our attitude towards Italy which  involved the adoptionof a  purely  defensive  naval strategy in the Mediterranean would do nothing to improve the position of the Army or the Air Force, since  the  strengths  anddispositions of their forces  in the Middle East are at present only sufficient toact purely on the defensive against Italian aggression.Situation in the Event of Mobilisation and  on the  Assumption  that Peace is                      Guaranteed in the Mediterranean.    41.  In  these circumstances,  naval forces  in the Mediterranean  could bereduced to a very low  level and the whole of our Navy,  except those ships ondistant foreign stations, would be available for service in a war against Germany.This  redistribution  could be effected in a period of  about ten days,  but the reserves of ammunition, stores, &amp;c, would take somewhat longer, say, fourteen to twenty days.
    42.  Military reinforcements  could  be withdrawn  from  Egypt  with theexception of one Infantry Brigade, which was sent out to meet internal security requirements,  and is still required for that purpose.   Three Battalions could betaken from Malta, and A.A.  and Coast  Defence reinforcements could  be with-drawn from Malta and other defended ports.    43.  It should be noted, however, that some two months would be required tobring Home units from the Mediterranean and to re-organise them.    44.  The  effect of these withdrawals  would be to make available, for a EieldForce, AA. tank and other units.  But the total strength of the Field force which could be maintained overseas could not be in  excess of two divisions forsome  months on  account  of the impossibility  of  equipping and maintaining alarger force at the outset.    45.  The  return of coast defence reinforcements would also enable the coast defences at Home to  be  strengthened, and the increased  number of  infantry battalions will allow internal security to be put on an improved basis.    46.  The  withdrawal of the air reinforcements and their re-establishment ona satisfactory operational footing in this  country  would take at least 3 to 4months.   Consequently, it would  be  essential  to  carry out these movements as early  as  possible.  Assuming that this could be done satisfactorily, the position at Home would, on completion of  these movements, be improved by the  additionof the following squadrons with their reserves :           Fighter  Squadrons              Single-seaters   ...     ...     ...     ...     ...      ...     1    Two-seatersLight Bomber Squadrons  ...Torpedo Bomber SquadronsFlying Boat Squadrons    (but see para. 7)Coast Defence (Spotter)  Squadron4513144     A summary of the first-line air strength at the various stages discussed above is given in Appendix II.                         French Naval Co-operation.     47.  French naval forces are distributed between the Mediterranean and the atlantic.  Those in the Atlantic area are as follows :               3 Battleships  (old).             2 Battleships  (very old).             3^-6-inch-gun Cruisers.            12 Small Cruisers.            19 Destroyers.            29 Submarines.     48.  The only existing German vessels capable of being  a serious threat toour  trade are the  three Deutschland class battleships  and their submarines, theformer, in particular,  with their long endurance and heavy guns, are a serious problem.  The only vessels which can deal with the Deutschland class  are battle-cruisers, or a concentration of several 8-inch-gun cruisers.     49.  We have at present only  two battle-cruisers available for service  (oneof our  three is refitting), and 8-inch-gun cruisers  can ill be spared  from the.Mediterranean unless peace in that area is assured a  large proportion of our8-inch-gun cruiser strength  is in China,  and it appears very undesirable further to weaken ourselves in that area.  It is  in dealing with these ships that Frenchassistance would be particularly valuable, but the French  also have at presentall their 8-inch cruisers in the Mediterranean, and have, in fact,  in the Atlanticno ship capable of dealing with the Deutschland class.     50.  If there is any chance of war with Germany,  it is, therefore, consideredimportant that France should  be pressed to move some or all of her 7-8-inch cruisers to the Atlantic,  as these are the only vessels she at present possessescapable of dealing with the  Deutschland class.
                                CONCLUSIONS.     (a) If war with Germany, were  to break out while our forces are disposed asat present,  we should be perilously exposed in the; air and completely  open toattack at sea.  The French would be  equally susceptible to naval attack.  It wouldbe impossible to send overseas any army formations.     (b) If mobilisation is ordered without withdrawal: from the Mediterraneanthe situation on  the naval  side would be considerably improved, but the forces available would still not be sufficient to secure the British Isles and our  trade routes (or those of the French).  The increase in our air strength and improve-ment to our air striking power at Home which would result from mobilisationwould do little to reduce the seriousness of the air defence situation.   A  smallField Force, but lacking in  modern equipment, could be despatched overseas.     (c) (i) If we adopt a defensive strategy in the Mediterranean, certain naval.units can be withdrawn which should be sufficient, with mobilisation, to  providereasonable security for our trade routes and the British Isles, provided  thatunrestricted submarine warfare were not adopted.  There would be no alterationof note in the Army and Air Force situation.  We do not recommend this policy.     (ii) If peace is guaranteed in the Mediterranean, the necessary naval distri-bution for the complete requirements for a war with Germany could be  effected in a period of about ten  days  so far as Flis Majesty&apos;s ships are concerned, butadequate seaward defence of. our ports would take longer.   The Field Force couldbe provided with tank and air defence units, and some anti-tank guns,  but not for two months after the orders for withdrawal  are given.   Air defence units  atHome  would be  strengthened.  The  air  situation would be very little improveduntil after three to four months, and even then the total air strength available  atHome would be quite inadequate for security against air attack or to prosecutesuccessfully an air offensive against  Germany.    2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,          March 16, 1936.APPENDIX  I  TO ENCLOSURE.   &apos;  &apos; :           Ships at More than 14 Days&apos; Notice.At 28 days&apos; notice      1 Battles!)ip (Resolution).At 42 days&apos; notice      3 6-inch Cruisers.     9 Destroyers.     1 Submarine (refitting).At 56 days&apos; notice      20 Destroyers.At more than 56 days&apos; notice -     2 Aircraft Carriers (Courageous, refitting, completes 24/6,  and Argus)..     2 7- 5-inch  Cruisers (4J months).     7 Destroyers.     1 -6-inch Cruiser  (completes 6/7).     8 Submarines.Long refit      1 battle cruiser  (Repulse, completes 11/5).     3 Battleships.     2 -8-inch Cruisers.
