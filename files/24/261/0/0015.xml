Paper  No.  1123-3)) in whichwe considered whether  effective  economic pressure could he exercised on Germany  on the  assumption that the Councilof the League, by  a unanimous vote,  recommended Membersof the League to co-operate  in  such pressure in a situationwhere Article 15 of  the  Covenant was not applicable.In June, 1935,. in  consequence of a  direction from thePrime Minister, we reconsidered this possibility in thelight of Russia as a Member  of  the  League of Nations and willing to collaborate with  the other Powers.   our report (Paper No.  A. T. B. (E, P. )  19 (Revise)  (also C. I. D.Paper No.  1175-B)) was prepared in the form of acommentary on the  previous Report.                           -1-
 2.      At the meeting of the Cabinet held cn 9th March,  1936 (Cabinet 15(36) Conclusion 2) the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,  as Chairman of  the  Advisory Committee  on Trade Questions in Time  of War,  reminded the  Cabinet of our previous Reports and said that,  in  the light of the report in  the  French press  that the French Government  were considering making a proposal at  Geneva to apply economic  sanctions to Germany, he  proposed to bring the last  Report up-to-date. 3o   The  Committee&apos; have  not  been  able,  in the time at their  disposal, to prepare  a complete  Report,  but in view of  the necessity for speed they have  prepared the following Provisional Report.            I.  PRELIMINARY  CONSIPERATI0N3.4.   The position we  are now called upon to  consideris the possibility of economic pressure being imposed on Germany  in order  to compel her  to evacuate the rhineland she has re-occupied in violation  of Articles42 and 43 of the Treaty  of Versailles and  of  the Treatyof Locarno.    The assumption is that such  action  wouldbe held to  fall within the definition of  &quot;assistance&quot;which the Locarno Powers are pledged under paragraph 2of Article  4 of the Locarno  Treaty5 to  give to  &quot;the power against whom the Act  complained ef is directed&quot;.50    In the first place, therefore, we  must consider the case, where, either  as the result of  a  recommenda- tion by the Council  of the League  or of a  common agreement between the Locarno Powers, economic  pressure on Germany  was exercised by  these  Powers  alone, i. e., Great Britain. France, Belgium and Italy.                       -2-
60    In  addition,  the  Council  can recommend,  in virtue of Article  11, Article  13(4) and  Article  15(4)  of the Covenant  the use  of  economic pressure  as  a means  of terminating a threat to the peace  of the  world.    This involves  (a) a unanimous recommendation to that effect by the Council;   and (b) the acceptance of the  recommenda-tion by all the Members of the League, or  at  any  rate  asufficient number to justify the action in question being taken..7c   Again,  the Council, in its Resolution of 17th April,1935,  declared as follows : -     &quot;The Council;                        III.          &quot;Considering that the unilateral repudiation     of international obligations may endanger the very     existence of the League of Nations as an organisation     for maintaining peace and promoting security,          Decides:          That such repudiation, without prejudice to     the application of the measures already provided in     international agreements,  should, in the event of its     having relation to undertakings concerning the     security/ of peoples and the maintenance of peace in     Europe, call into play all appropriate measures on     the part of Members of the League and within the     framework of the Covenant;          Requests a committee composed of           to     propose for this purpose measures to render the     Covenant more effective in the organisation of     collective security and to define in particular     the economic and financial measures which might be     applied, should in the future a State,  whether a     Member of the League of Nations or not,  endanger     peace by the unilateral repudiation of its inter-     national obligations, &quot;8C   The measures referred to in the latter part of this resolution were discussed but never formulated or adoptedby the Council;   but the Council,  if it held that thepresent violation of the Demilitarised Zone  constitutes a repudiation of an international obligation endangering
 the very existence of the League of flattens,  etc., might resume  examination of economic and financial measures to he  imposed on Germany,  hut even so,  the imposition of such measures would still remain entirely facultative.          II,   COUNTRIES LIKELY TO CO-0?KS?A.TB. 90   Action &quot;b:/  the  Loczrno ^pjf^v^^^Xf^et    In view of the  sanctions which Prance and Great Britain  are  at the  present moment  imposing on Italy?  we  assume that Italy will decline  to  co-operate in any measures  for imposing  sanctions  on  Germany.    Under this  head, therefore, sanctions would in  effect be applied only by Great  Britain, Prance  and Belgium. 10,  Act ion. by  the.  League ,,in virtue of  a unanimous recommendation  of lhei  Council.    Here  it  must be borne in mind, that the case  under consideration  is  fundamentally different from  the  recent  case  when sanctions were imposed on Italy.   In  the  latter  case the  Members of the League wore under  an  actual  obligation in virtue  ofArticle 16.   In the present case we are assuming that the  occupation  of the  Rhine land &quot;has  not resulted in war and that neither Article 16 nor  paragraph 3 ofArticle 17 Is in operation,.    The Members of the League are, therefore, under  210  obligation  but are free to accept or reject as they  think  fit  any  recommendation which the Council may  make.     Subject to this consideration,  the following- estimate may be hazarded,                      /   -4-
 11 o  . Initial Vote by CounciL.&quot;Members.,  We must  assume  at any rate  the  abstention of  Italy;     The  refusal  of Denmark to  vote for the  Council Resolution of 17th  April,  1935, would point to the  fact that Denmark  would  also abstain. Australia would  probably follow the lead  of the United Kingdom.    Doubtful States would  be  the  South  American Members of the Council,  and those  States  who have  particu- larly important  trade relations  with  Germany, such as Portugal,  Roumania, Turkey, Spain  and Poland.   But, taking one thing with another,  one might  reasonably assume  that there would be no hostile vote if Prance and. Great Britain gave a strong lead. 12.   Action by the^Leegue States generally.   . When it  comes to asking the League States generally to carry  out the recommendation of the Council,  only the following States can be  regarded as certain supporters of a seuictions policy                   Prance                   Belgium                   U. S. So R. (i)  The following States can be regarded as unlikely to co-operate on political grounds  -         (a)   Weak limitrophe States fearful  of                German antagonism and even of                German attack -                   Netherlands  (and N. E. I. )                   Switzerland                   Austria                   Denmark                   Lithuania.         (b)   States who, for one reason or  another,                are in sympathy with Germany-                   Hungary                   Bulgari a                   Poland.(ii)  The following States can be regarded as unlikely to co-operate on economic  grounds  -                   States whose trade with Germany                     is a particularly important element                     in their economy -                      All of the States mentioned under                      (a) and (b),  except (in present                      circumstances) Lithuania.

OOooooooooo              Most, if not all, of the Central              and South American and West Indian              countries, notably those whose trade              with Germany is Important and/or has              been growing greatly during the last              year, e. g. -              Argentina              Chile              Peru              Colombia              Mexico              Venezue la.     -As stated above,  it must be assumed that Italy,  animportant  customer of Germany,  would not co-operate.13.      The Dominion Governments and British India would bein a difficult position;   politically,  they would wish tofollow the lead of the United Kingdom;   but their trade withGermany,  though declining in recent years,  is an important consideration to them.14.      Of the big non-League Powers,  the United States,Japan and Brazil,  it could not be expected that anyof them would co-operate.    The United States Gevern-ment might conceivably &quot;advice&quot; United States exportersnot to exceed normal supplies  to Germany,  but,  evenCzechoslovakia     )  Little Entente
so, the efficacy of such advice would he most doubtful.The recent United States Neutrality legislation pro-prohibiting exports of war material and the grant ofcredits and loans would,  of course,  only come intoforce in the case of actual war between Germany andsome other Power.15.     It should be pointed out that since germany is the third most important impart market in theworlds the economic consideration is likely to weighfar more heavily in the case of applying sanctionsto Germany than it did in the case of applyingsanctions to Italy,,
III.   PACIFIC BLOCKADE.16.     As in our previous Reports,  we again reject theidea of a &quot;Pacific Blockade&quot;  for the following reasons :-(i)  It has never hern exercised against a naval      Power of any Importance,  and if any attempt      to use the naval forces of the participating      Powers to enforce such a policy was made and      Germany provided a naval escort for shipping      destined to or leaving German ports,  the      naval forces of the participating Powers would      either have to let them pass unmolested,  or      attack the escorting men-of-war.    More      importance is  attached to this point  to-day      in view of the prospective developments  in      the German Navy.    A stats of war might  ensue      in the circumstances where the participating      Powers endeavoured to enforce their policy(ii)  Precedents are in favour of the view that a       &quot;Pacific Blockade&quot; could not he enforced       against merchant ships of a third party.       In practice the importance of this considera-       tion would depend on the number of the non-       participating countries and the size of their       mercantile marine .(iii)   It is doubtful whether,  under the Covenant        and other instruments,  such as the Pact of        Paris,  a pacific blockade is permissible        except  where  it is  imposed with the authority        of the  League of Nations:   the Treaty of        Locarno does  not confer on the signatories        any right to  declare  a  pacific blockade which        they do not  otherwise possess.     The withholding of supplies from Germany by direct action could, therefore, only be carried on by measuresundertaken separately by each country applying the sanctions in question.
         IV.  POSSIBLE. EFFECT OF AIT EMBARGO  ON                    IMPORTS FROM GSRMANY.17.     Our previous Reports were particularly directed  tothe question of the extent to which Germany  was dependenton specific markets for the supply of  certain  foodstuffs and raw material.    The application of  sanctions  in  thecase of Italy has shown that the simplest  and  most effec-tive form of economic pressure is to reduce  a  country&apos;s foreign exchange resources by prohibiting  exports fromthat country to the participating States.    We  thereforeproceed to examine :-     (a)  Germany1s minimum import requirements of           certain essential commodities taking           account of existing stocks;  and.     (b)  her probable foreign exchange resources           either in the form of free exchange  (e. g. ,           from the United States of America or as           the result of bilateral arrangements (e.g.  ,           cotton from Brazil),) s18.      As regards (a),  Germany&apos;s imports  of the moreimportant food products and raw materials during 1935are given in Annex I.    On the assumption that  a largeproportion of Germany&apos;s export trade is stopped therewould,  of course?  be  a considerable reduction of herrequirements for raw materials.   Her total minimum re-quirements of foreign goods could be diminished, by a lowering of the standard of living.    The process of find-ing substitutes for foreign raw material which has  alreadygone farther in Germany than in any other country would.no doubt be carried, further still.   Finally,  by drawingon her  existing stocks a further  economy would be possible without seriously impairing her military efficiency so lonf
as the stocks remain unexhausted.    However, the stocksof many essential raw materials are believed to be very low indeed.   There is evidence that certain cloth millsmaking military cloth were obliged to close down for afew days in December, owing to a shortage of raw materials.There were signs of shortage of non-ferrous metals even for the armament industry for a period.    Exceptions are -     Motor spirit and Aviation Spirit - a year&apos;s supply                                        at present rate of                                        consumption.     probably also a considerable quantity - perhaps     as large - of Diesel and Lubricating Oil.     Tin and Lead..... 6 . to 9 monbhs&apos;  reserve at present                        rate of consumption believed to                       . exist.     Nickel............ 4 to 5 months&apos;  supply contained in                        coinage.            -,     Perro-fAlloys...... perhaps a year at present rate of                        consumption.     On the other hand, there would appear to be noaccumulated reserves of Iron 0re,  Copper, Aluminium, PyritesChrome ore,Cotton or Jute, and present supplies are fromhand to mouth019o  As regards  (b)s Germany&apos;s foreign exchange resources,her existing gold reserve (published and unpublished)amounts to at least  20 million sterling.   Furtherresources could be obtained by the sale of foreign securities owned in Germany.    The value of suchsecurities has &quot;been mentioned in the German press asboing ELI.  1,000 million ( 80 million) but no reliablefigure is  available and in any case a part of thesesecurities would hot be readily saleable.20.  SO per cent, of the German exports are paid forthrough bilateral clearing and better arrangementsso that only the remaining 20 per cent,  produces freeforeign exchange.  Of the total amount of such free foreign exchange (approximately  60 million)   30 million is derivedfrom exports to the United Kingdom.   A further  14 million                      -10-
  is  derived from her exports to the United States  of   &quot; *  America,, and the rest from miscellaneous sources.   Of  the Locarno Powers, only the United Kingdom provides  Germany with free foreign exchange.   Tims 3 if the  Locarno Powers other than Italy imposed, an embargo on  imports from Germany&quot;9 half of Germany&apos;s existing resources  in free foreign exchange would be lest to her.   Action  by all States Members might increase this loss to  two-thirds. fcJl.   Germany could, of course, obtain a substantial pro- portion of the commodities which she needs under bilateral arrangements with  the countries which would not participate or with countries  whose participation has already been described as doubtful.           V.   PROHIBITION OP EXPORTS TO GERMANY.                        Foodstuffs. 22.    Germany has  attained a considerable  measure of  self- sufficiency  in foodstuffs under normal conditions s. but certain essential commoditiess  for  which  adequate sub- stitutes  are  not available,  must still be  imported (See Annex  I). The  principal  deficiencies  in foodstuffs  are -       Pats c,  oilseeds s  oilcake and other fodder.       Pish,,  though  it  is probably not  beyond the        power  of the. German  fishing fleet to meet        requirement s.       Maize and rice..       Tea, coffee and cocoa. 23.    Pats of  all kinds  are  in  very  short supply  in    . . Germany at present.   The immediate prospective increase in  stocks is in whale oil, of which some 75,000 tons have been bought, from the new catch and will be delivered by&quot;the  end of April.   A further survey is given in Annex  II.                            -11-
                                                   Q  t&quot;                                                   &amp;: &apos;3 3              Other essent,inl coiniaod 11ies.,24.   Germany&apos;s principal deficiencies in textile rawmaterialss metals, metallic ores, mineral oils s etc. 9 are                 Cotton                 Wool                 Hemp                 Jute                 Rubber                 Iron, ore                 Copper                 Bauxite                 Pyrites                 Nickel                 vVolf ram                 Tin                 Manganese                 Chrome ore                 Petroleum products.Of the above, however 5 there is a stock of a,000,000 tonsof motor spirit equivalent to a year&apos;s normal consumption and Germany now produces half of her normal consumption(less aviation spirit)  from domestic resources.   There ireason to believe that considerable stocks are held ofmanganese, wolfram and tin;   while there is believed tobe about four months&apos;  supply of nickel and some stocks of wool.25.   The iron ore position is particularly noteworthy.German consumption in 1935 was about 13 million tons,ofwhich only about 22% was made available from domesticsources.   Since no large stocks are believed to be held,a successful prevention of imports of  iron ore and, ofcourse, pig iron,  steel and  scrap as alternatives,would produce a rapid and serious effect upon german industry and national life.26.   As regards rubber, Germany&apos;has not only plant forreclaiming waste, but two plants erected for the manu-facture of synthetic rubber in emergency, reported tobe capable of supplying at capacity 50 per cent,  ofGerman annual requirements.
a7.    On  the other hand,  stocks of cotton,  hemp  and  juteare  agreed  to be negligible;  while,  as previouslypointed out. (paragraph 24) , . no&apos; significant  sicfeks- are&apos;believed to e-xjL-st  of iron ore,  copper,  aluminium orbauxite,  pyrites  and chrome  ere0-08.    With  the  exception  of  jute, wool  cocoa  and ofmanganese,  of which  large stocks are held,  most  of the deficiency  requirements could be obtained from countrieswhich  are not participating, or -whose participation isdoubtful.-39.   Moreover, in any case, as pointed out in cur pre-visus Reports,  if the participating Powers prohibited.experts of c abstain commodities to Germ shy-, re-exporttrade in such commodities would soon be developed in non--participating countries and it would be impossibleto stop such trade without  some  rationing systemof the countries concerned.                    VI.  SHIPPING.30.   The bulk  of German shipping is engaged in  service to or from German ports.    The effect and dangers of&quot;shipping sanctions&quot;  in general have been considered on more than one occasion since our last Report, and theCommittee observe that his Majesty&apos;s Government have not hitherto been prepared to impose &quot;shipping sanctions&quot; on italy.31.   To deny German shipping the ports of the UnitedKingdom along would stop the  entry of some 3,800 ships
 in a year.        however,  the reason for their calling at these ports,  together with the  ports  of  participating Powers,  would in the  main  he  ruled out if economic  . pressure were introduced,  the imposition of an embargo on German ships  would not  materially affect  the situation. 32.    As regards British shipping,  the cutting -siff  of Gsrman trade  would have serious effects.    Approximately a,600  British ships of 4,000,000 net  register  tonnage call at  German ports  in a  year, representing about 12 per cent,  of  the total  tonnage using  those  ports. It must,  however, be  recollected that a  great  proportion of this  trade is with participating Powers and would inevitably be lost.   Further&quot;s British shipping will be able  to take  advantage  of the, trade lost by the Germans.              VII.   FINANCIAL PRESSURE, 33-    In the  case of Germany s as in the case of Italy? fin an cial pressure, as  such, would have  little practical effect, since  germany&apos;s  credit stands very low and it  is already impossible for- her to borrow further abroad.   If credits  to Germany were prohibited Germany would lose the convenience  of being able to finance  a considerable part of her foreign tre.de  through the acceptance market in London, but this would not  be a  decisive  factor. The prohibition of the sale of goods to Germany on credit would  also only occasion Germany comparatively minor  inconvenience,  as the commodities which she chiefly requires have already to be bought  for cash  or  paid  for on short-credit terms.
                                                      9 *? Q            VIIIo  EFFECT OH THE  UNITED KINGDOM.                        Imports from Germany. 340  As  regards  imports from Germany  of food products? there  would he no  difficulty in  finding alternative  sources. The  same  is true as  regards raw  materials.    In manufactured goods  no  difficulties  as  to supplies  should  arise, except in specialised products.     There might he a temporary shortage  of such products  as  acetic anhydride  and  oxalic acid,  and some classes  of  synthetic dyes would not he pro- curable.    There might  also  he  some  difficulties  over chemical porcelain,  certain scientific  and optical glass- ware,  specialised machine  tools  and machinery  and hosiery latch  needles.    There would also he  a cessation  of supply of many fine chemicals  subject to Key  Industry Duty.    Many of them could, of course, be made here,  after an experimental period and at a  cost.                       Exports to Germany. 35c  As regards  our exports to Germany,  the main items arefish,  coal, raw,wool, waste and noils,  cotton  yarn, cotton piece-goods,  woollen and worsted and mohair yarns,  wooltops, woollen and worsted tissues and machinery.   Whilstin the case of coal we should lose a substantial exporttrade  to Germany, the refusal of any other States to takeGerman coal would increase  our capacity for exporting t*those countries,  although no doubt the deficiency in thosecountries would be largely made up by increased domestic production.    When the pressure was removed,  there  might wellbe a permanent loss owing to the refusal of Germany to resume imports of British coalj  and. to the  recapture  by                        -15-
Germany  of  some part  at  least  of her  former markets.The loss  of the German fisjr trade  might he  a serious matter for  the fish industry.    The  loos  of the Germanmarket would be of serious  consequence to  the  fine-spinning  section  of the  Lancashire industry.   We shouldalso lose an important market  for  wool tops and  woollenworsted and mohair Arams.    On the other hand,  certaintrades, e.gl, the machinery trade,  should,  on balancegain considerably from a cessation of German competition in the Home market and,  to  some extent, in  expertmarkets.     It is also to be remembered that there  is  avery consid.erable re-export  trade  to Germany;  the  main items are raw wool, furskins,  leather, rubber, coffeeand tea.     Finally,   certain of the Dominions  and colonies have a very valuable  direct trade  with Germany.                    Shinping.36o  We have already dealt with this in paragraphs  30-32.                      Finance.37,  Germany owes the City  of  London on short-term, inrespect of  acceptance and other credits,  a.  sum of about 40 million.    These are covered by the StandstillAgreement, under which interest is paid regularly,  andthe Bills constitute good assets in the hands  of  the holders.     The imposition of  economic pressure wouldprobably bring the Standstill  Agreement to  an  end andremittances would cease  to be made.   The financialhouses concerned would remain  liable for the Bills, anda certain number of them would almost certainly be faced with  insolvency unless His Majesty&apos;s  Governmentguaranteed  the Bills.     This would require  legislation which would be open to a good  deal of criticism.   More-over,  the fact that certain financial houses had  to be                         -16-
assisted would impair confidence and lead to greatfinancial difficulties and provoke withdrawal ofcapital from Lord.on end a drain on sterling.Thegeneral  effect  in  the  City  of  e  breakdown of  the standstill -Agreement would  thus  be very  serious.38.      The United Kingdom  hold  about   26 million of theI!awes and Young Loans,  on which  interest is at  present being paid under the Anglo-German Payments Agreement of1st November, 1934, and perhaps   35 million of  other german bonds, etc., the interest on which is being met by&apos;the issue of 4 per cent. German Funding  Bonds.    There isalso a considerable amount  of short-term German debt not covered by the Standstill Agreement.    A default  on  the dawes and Young Loans and. a complete default on the  other german debt would,  of course, cause less  and hardship toBritish holders, but would hot seem likely to have any widespread financial repercussions.390     The financial institutions in  the  netherlands and Switzerland and,  in particular,  the  Swiss banks, areheavily involved in Germany.   Interest  on German Bondsheld in these markets is at present being met with certainreductions under the Clearing Agreements  and both countries are, moreover, interested to a large extent as creditorsin the Standstill.    A general default by Germany might bring down the Swiss Banks immediately.   In Holland.the barks are not in so weak a position,  but a Germandefault would lead to grave financial  trouble.    Currencydifficulties would,  of course,  be precipitated in both countries,  if they are still on the present gold standard.40.Finally, the United Kingdom is interested to a
substantial  degree  in  manufacture  and  distributionwithin Germany.     For  example, the British oil companies handle  about 30  per  cent,  of the  oil  tradein Germany,  and. the financial  loss  to  the UnitedKingdom caused by economic pressure would,  therefore,be serious.           IX.  CONCLUSIONS.41,      In conclusion  we would draw attention to thef oilowi ng p points i-     (l)   The case under consideration is fundamentally           different from the recent case where sanctions           were imposed on Italy because the action taken           in regard to Italy under -Article 16  automatically           imposed an obligation on all Members of the           League to adopt sanctions, whereas in action           taken in the case contemplated it would be           optional for each Member of the League to reach           its own decision to accept or reject the           Council&apos;s recommendations.   Certain States might           hesitate,-to accept such recommendations either           for political  or for economic reasons, or for           both.     (2)   The effect on world trade of  economic sanctions           against Germany would be much more serious than           the effect of  economic sanctions  on. Italy,  since           Germany is the third, most important import           market in the  world.     The  effect on the economy           of certain States would, be particularly serious.     (3)   If the precedent of the Italian case were           followed and an embargo were Imposed by the           Locarno Powers (minus Italy) on imports from                          -18-
                         Germany,  Germany would lose  nearly 20 per cent                         of  her  export  trade  and would he  deprived of                          30 million  out  of her present annual  60                         million of free  foreign exchange,   Foreign                         exchange  is  of great  im.portan.ee to Germany                         for the purchase of  ores and fats,                   (4)   If such  an embargo were imposed by all States                         Members of the League it would obviously have                         a much  greater and more rapid  effect.   It                         would deprive  Germany of 90  per cent,  of her                         export  trade and approximately  40 million of                         her annual free  foreign exchange.                   (5)  We have  in this Report endeavoured to  set out                         such information as can be compiled, at  short                         notice  regarding Germany&apos;s requirements  of                         foodstuffs and raw materials.   ifhout  further                         information  as to the  States  likely to  co-                         operate (e.g.  as  to whether  Sweden will  refuse                         supplies  of  iron ore),it is  impossible  to                         form even provisional conclusions  as  to  the                         effect  of economic sanctions  on Germany.

ANNEX IIo30D and FODDER POSITION OP GERMANY.(NOTE.  The statements and xigures below are taken Prom Germanofficial sources and should he accepted with some reserve.It is believed,  however, that the estimates of quantitiesare not unreliable.)requirements can be supplied from home sources under normalharvest conditions.fat supplies were imported.  Consumption per head of all fatswas lower in 1935 than in any year since 1928, and 12 per cent.below that of 1932.  The situation is less favourable thanthe figures indicate (l) because a serious worseningtooii place during the last six months of 1935, and (2) becausethe shortage has been concentrated in the large towns ratherthan spread over the whole country.3.       Fodder Suoplies.  The home production of fats dependslargely on imports of fodder.  Home fodder production in 1935 was higher than in the drought year 1934 but lower than in 1928/29and 1933.  Pasturage was better than for any recent years,  butroot crops were worse than in any year since 1932.   Imports of oil cake were lower in 1935 than for several years  and the  annualweight fed to cows was 265 lbs. per head as against 359 lbs.  in1934S 392 lbs. in 1933 and 420 lbs.  in 1932.1.About 80 per cent, of germany&apos;s total food and fodder2.Fat......Supplies;.In 1935 4V per cent,  of Germany&apos;sTable I.

4.   Meat Supplies.   The poor fodder harvest of 1934compelled farmers to reduce their holdings of pigs and cattle and to slaughter unripe stock.   This was reflected in adecrease in pig numbers from 25.1 million head in September1934 to 22.6 million in September 1935.   At the same time theslaughter weight of pigs declined from August 1935  as thesupplies of fodder were reduced.    In consequence, supiJlies of meat fell from August onwards.     Table II. summarises the estimated annual meatconsumption per head in recent years.     Table II.    &quot;Estimated Meat Consumption.

Normal pig supplies    must await the resumption of equilibrium at the present    price level between supplies of pork and lard and demand.    The September census shows that the increase in pig    numbers is going steadily forward and. by March 1936 a    normal level should be again attained.   As regards pork    and lard the prospects are therefore bright but the    opposite is true of beef and veal.   In the second half    of 1934 cattle numbers fell by 250,000 head through    excessive slaughterings and a further decline of 400,000    head took place in the first  half of 1935.    As a result    an estimated decline of 10 per cent, in beef and veal    supplies is anticipated for 19.T3.   The gap will be largely    made good by imports, and trade agreements to this end    have already been concluded.         The supply situation of  milk products will improve    next spring at the same time  as increased supplies of pig    products will be available and this should lead to a    marked easing of the situation.   But much depends upon    the 1936 fodder harvest,
          Shortages resulting from variations in crops must     always he expected and when they occur they must he made     good by imports.    In the case of meat this solution     presents few difficulties since the dependence on imports     is small;  but in the case of fats imports still constitute     50 per cent,  of the supplies and in addition large     quantities of feed, principally oilseed.s and cake, have to     be imported,    The prospects of the fat supply situation     therefore hinges largely upon the,availability of foreign     exchange for the purchase of the fats and feeding stuffs     required&apos; to fill the gaps in domestic supplies.1&apos;6.   General Summary.    The general picture obtained fromofficial sources shows that supplies of fats and animalproducts for human consumption, and supplies of fodder for animal consumption, have been decreasing since last summer.Future prospects depend (l) on weather conditions, and (2)upon the availability of foreign exchange for the purchase of imported fats and feedingstuffs.
