COPY NO.   UP,C A B I N E to employment OF UNTRUSTWORTHY PERSONS IN THE          DEFENCE  DEPARTMENTS&quot;,  Memorandum by  the  First  Lord of the Admiralty.     The  occurrence  of  a number of cases of sabotagein ships  under dockyard repair,  and the results of the investigations by  the Police  and Security Service inconnection therewith, indicate that it is urgently necessaryfor the Defence  Departments to take further steps to guard against the  employment  in  their  establishments of personswho from  their known associations  and activities are considered to be a source  of  danger.2.     In the past three shears eight cases of sabotagehave occurred in the Dockyards -     at Devonport and one at Chatham in 1933,  and two at Devonport,  two at Chatham,                                   J  ^one at Portsmouth  and one  at  Sheemess in the last fewmonths.      The recent cases  are  still under investigation.In the first two Devonport cases there were strong reasonsfor suspecting a man who was  known to- be a Communist,  butit was impossible  to get proof.     In the third Devonportcase very little evidence  was  obtainable,  but it was foundthat although the  authorities  maintained great secrecy asto what had  occurred, the  facts  were known in considerable-1-
                                                      9-f C                                                      w i. J detail  to  certain employees with  Communist  sympathies. It  appears  also that  the belief that  these  outrages  are the work of  a few Communists is general  amongst  the Dockyard men themselves, the reason being that individual Communists,  at their meetings and in  discussions  with those of their own class, make no secret of  the fact  that sabotage is  one of the methods to be  employed to  paralyse the Government and the community  when the occasion arises. 3.     It is unnecessary to enlarge upon the ease with which machinery can be seriously  damaged, and the numerous opportunities that anyone of a large number  of men at work on a ship or employed about  a workshop has of committing such an act with very  little risk of detection., To put it briefly,  the chances of getting direct evidence against any individual are almost  nil, and the only real safeguard is to restrict employment in the Dockyards* Ordnance Factories  and. other establishments under theDefence Departments  to men who can be trusted to.render loyal service.4.     A procedure has already been introduced,  inconsultation with the  Security Service,  by which theantecedents of new employees under the Defence departments will be more carefully enquired into at the time  of entry,with the object of eliminating undesirables. 5.     In dealing with those who are  actually in  their employment,  the Defence Departments  have, up to thepresent, been acting upon a Cabinet  decision which was laid down in 1927 (Cabinet 35(27)  Conclusion l)  and confirmed on 2nd December,  1931  (Cabinet 84(.31) Conclusion 3 (b)) and which is  as follows  ;-
        (a)  Persons who can he shown by reasonable               evidence to be actively engaged in               the dissemination of anti-constitutional               and revolutionary propaganda9  either               oral or written, should be discharged               forthwith and without pension  or other               superannuation benefit:        (b)  Persons who merely label themselves as               Communists without taking any  active               part in the furtherance of Communisrd               should be eliminated as and when oppor-               tunity offers, i0e., by discharge on               reduction.6.     It is found, however,  that in practice these rules do not give a sufficiently clear or wide authorityto the Defence Departments to eliminate all employeeswhose employment  is considered to be a danger to theState.7.     Rule (a) only covers &quot;persons who can be shown by reasonable evidence  to be actively engagedin the dissemination of anti-constitutional and revo-revolutionary propaganda&quot;     Obviously,  this is onlyone form of dangerous activity,  and experience showsthat, in consequence  of the rule,  the  authorities  incharge of establishments  tend to act on the assumptionthat a man who cannot be  shown to be actively engagedin disseminating  propaganda,  but who by reason ofother subversive  activities is clearly an untrust-worthy employee,  can only be  discharged if and when an opportunity arises under rule (b).8.     Rule (b),  moreover,  is very difficult to operate.It cannot be applied to Established men.    Even where
 unestaolished. men are concerned., opportunities of dis- charging  on reduction occur very intermittently , and when  the  establishments are busy., do not occur at all. Moreover,  it is a long-established practice that dis- charges on reduction shall normally be made on the basis of relative competency, and to include a man v;ho is a competent  workman5 but whose loyalty is under suspicion, is exceedingly difficult without resorting to subterfuge, and sometimes is quite impossible. 9.    A further difficulty in applying the existing Cabinet ruling arises from the fact that it is the ordinary rule of the Civil Service  that &quot;except in cases which may give rise to criminal proceedings, full parti- circulars of  any charge against an officer&apos;s conduct shall be communicated to him in writing before any disciplinary action is decided upon&quot;.    The same principle  is  embodied in departmental regulations applicable to industrial classess e.g. , Article 49 of the Home Dockyard Regula- ti ons.10.    Evidence., however ,  of subversive activity on thepart of any individual is  in most cases only obtainableby using secret sources  of informations and in using such evidence the authorities  are placed in a  dilemma.    If a charge of this nature is  made without stating  theevidence to support  it,  a flat denial is  always possible.If,  on the other hand,  the evidence  is  revealed,  the source of the  information is rendered useless  for thefuture.11.    The Treasury  and the Defence Departments have  inconsultation carefully reviewed the  whole question and
 make the following proposal which I recommend, for adoption hy the Cabinet. 12.    In any  ease in which there is reason to believe that any employee of a Defence Department has been, is, or is  likely  to be engaged in activities endangering the safety or interests of the State% immediate enquiry into all  the  relevant circumstances shall be made by a departmental  committee consisting of the permanent Civilian Head of the Department, the Establishment Officer and  a representative of the Treasury.       If the Committee is satisfied that the case is made out;, it  shall so report to the Cabinet Minister  of theDepartment with a recommendation for the man&apos;s  immediate discharge.      In the event of such a case being challenged inParliaments the Cabinet Minister would inform the House that he has satisfied himself as to  the facts of the casebut that it would not be consistent  with the public interest to go into  further details.13.   The Secretaries  of State for War and Air,  and  SirWarren Fisher, as  Head of the  Civil  Service,  concur  inthe above proposals,  which I.invite  my colleagues  to approve.
