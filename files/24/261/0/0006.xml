REPORT.         1.     At  their  Meeting on March  11th, 1935  (Cabinet  17 (36)         Conclusion 5)  the Cabinet agreed  that the Lord President  of         the  Council&apos;o  Memorandum on the Coronation (CP. 67 (36))         should be  considered by a Cabinet Committee  composed  as         follows                The Lord President of the Council  (in the Chair)                The Lord Chancellor                The Secretary of State for Home Affairs                The Secretary of State for Dominion  Affairs                The First Commissioner of Works,,         2.     The Lord  President&apos;s Memorandum was concerned  with         two  main cuestions  (l) the date of the Coronation, and         (2)  the procedure by which the preparations  for-a Coronation         are  initiated.,         3.     On  the  occasion of the Coronation of  King George V,         Coronation Day was  Thursday, 22nd June, 1911, and on  the         following  day  -  Friday, 23rd June, there was a State  Procession         through London with Presentation  of Addresses, etc.         Similar arrangements were made in 1902 but,  owing to  King         Edward&apos;s recent  illness an interval of about two months         elapsed between  the date of his Coronation on 9th August,         and  the State  Procession through London in the following         October.4,       In 1911?  June 22nd (Coronation Day)  was declared a bank Holiday and a Public Holiday throughout the UnitedKingdom.    The following day,  June 2ord., was declared a-1.
Bank and public Holiday in London only.    If, therefore,on the present occasion recent precedents are followed,it will he necessary to make provision for two days,  namely,the Coronation Day and the day on which the State Processionthrough London takes place.5.     After consultation with the President of the Board ofTrade we have reached the conclusion that from the point  ofview both of general public convenience and of the leastdisturbance of trade and industry, the best course would  beto arrange that the Coronation dates should coincide  withthe Whitsuntide holidays.   In 1937 Whit  :onlay falls onMay 17th., and we suggest that, subject to His Majesty&apos;pleasure, the Coronation should he held on May 17th,  andthat the State Procession through London should take  placeon Tuesday, May 18th.6.     Whit Monday is net a Bank Holiday in Scotland, and ifthe Coronation is held on that day it will be necessary to declare May 17th, 1937, a Bank and Public Holiday inScotland.   This would make it very desirable that the wholeof England and Wales and Northern Ireland, hut not Scotland,(not London only as in 1911) should he given a Bank andPublic Holiday on Tuesday, May 18th, the suggested elate ofthe State Procession through London,  If these arrangements are adopted His Majesty&apos;s Coronation will only involve oneextra Bank and Public Holiday throughout the United Kingdom.We understand that the suggested dates present no insuperable difficulties from the point of view of the Defence Servicesand the Police.   The Secretary of State  for Dominion  affairs is taking steps to ascertain the views of the DominionGovernments on the dates contemplated above.7.     The position as regards procedure is explained in  theopening paragraphs of CP.  67 (36).    We think it very                       -2-
important that there should be no substantial departure onthe present occasion from the customary arrangements, andin particular that the precedents of 1901 and 1910 should &quot;befollowed as regards the appointment &quot;by the King in Councilof a Coronation Committee of the Privy Council and a Court of claims, and of the appointment &quot;by the Coronation Committeeof an Executive Committee to undertake the detailed work anddraw up the form of Ceremonial to he used in the Ah &quot;bey.8.     We accordingly recommend the Cabinet to adopt theLord Presidents proposal to advise His Majesty that thegeneral procedure outlined in the opening paragraphs of cp. 67 (36) should he followed.9.     The work of the Executive Committee of the coronation committee will he heavy and exacting, and we recommend thatthe Executive Committee should he provided with a smallSecretariat drawn from the Civil Service.   As this Secretariatmust work in close co-operation with the College of Arms, theLord President of the Council will discuss this suggestioninformally with the Earl Marshal.10.    The Committee submit the following recommendations to the Cahinet :-       (1) That, subject to His Majesty&apos;s Pleasure,           the date of the Coronation should he           Whit Monday, May 17th, 1937, and that           the State Procession through London           should taKie place on Tuesday, May 18th, 1937.       (2) That, subject to (1) above, Monday, May 17th,           1937, should be declared by Order in Council           a Banx and Public Holiday in Scotland, and           Tuesday, May 18-th, 1937, should similarly be          &apos; declared a Bank and Public Holiday in           England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
(3) That His Majesty should be advised that    the general procedure preparatory for the    Coronation outlined in the opening    paragraphs of CP.  67 (36) should he    followed.(4) That5 subject to the views of the Earl    Marshal, the Executive Committee of the    Coronation Committee should he provided    with a small Civil  Service Secretariat.Signed on behalf of the Committee       J.
