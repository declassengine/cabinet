Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.  1.   This Bill, which has been introduced by Sir David Reid,has been prepared by the Dock and Harbour Authorities&apos; association and its Second Reading is second Order for Friday, 27th March.  2.   The Bill (of which a copy is attached) is designed toextend to Pilotage Authorities the principle of the limitationof liability (in certain cases of loss or damage) which hasalready been accepted by Parliament, as regards owners of ships and harbour, dock and conservancy authorities, in MerchantShipping legislation.   The Bill now introduced has beensubmitted by the promoters to shipowners and to pilotageauthorities such as the Corporation of Trinity House, who aregenerally in favour of it.  5.   The Board of Trade are in sympathy with the objects ofthe Bill, which, in fact, is similar in some respects toprovisions drafted by the Department in 1928 for inclusion in a merchant Shipping Bill then under consideration.   It was  not,however, found possible to proceed with that Bill.  4.   In these circumstances I would ask that the Board ofTrade Spokesman should have authority,  if the Bill is reached on 27th March,  to state that the Government are in favour  ofthe principles embodied in the Bill.   The Debate will probablybring cut differences of opinion on some of the details of theBill which will properly be for discussion in the Committee towhich the Bill is referred, and the Parliamentary secretary might, subject to this, advise the House to give the Bill  aSecond Reading.W.R.3ard of Trade,16th March, 1936.
Pilotage  Authorities  (Limitation            of Liability)  Bill.                  MEMORANDUM.    The objects of this Bill are       1. To extend  to pilotage authorities a limitation           of liability for loss and damage.      2. To make clear that funds of a pilotage authority        .   formed for the benefit of pilots or their widows           or  children shall not be applicable  for the           liabilities  of the pilotage authority.      3. To provide that where a harbour, conservancy,           dock or canal authority are  also a pilotage           authority the funds belonging to the authority           in  one capacity shall not be  applicable  for           the liabilities of the authority in  another           capacity.    1. Decisions of the House of Lords in 1922 in pro-ceedings known  as  the  Dundee cases,  brought undernotice that the liability  of a  pilotage authority is not limited except as regards claims against them as owners of ships.  The claims in  the Dundee cases amounted toupwards of  600,000.    It is proposed by the Bill to limit the liability of apilotage authority, where loss or damage  to vessels or to goods merchandise or other things on  board any vesselor to  other property or rights  is caused (otherwise thanby  a  ship  owned by them) without  their actual faultor privity, to  100 per pilot licensed by them for thepilotage district.  This limit ( 100 per pilot) has relationto the size of the port and is  approved by the  Ship-owners&apos;  Parliamentary Committee.    Under maritime law if a pilotage authority  are theowners of a ship they may limit their liability  in that capacity for such loss or damage, and this Bill preservesthat right.   Further, the owners of a dock or canal or aharbour or conservancy authority may limit their liability for loss  or  damage caused  without their  actual fault orprivity to vessels  or goods,  merchandise or other thingson board any vessel.

To remove funds set aside for the benefit of pilotsor  their  widows  or children from liability to claims against the pilotage authority.     3. To remove the present risk that where a harbour,conservancy,  dock or  canal authority  are  exercisingthe functions of a  pilotage authority, funds held by theauthority in one capacity may  be held to be liable to claims against  the authority in  another capacity;  atpresent where the  pilotage authority is a separate bodythere is no such risk of dual liability.
