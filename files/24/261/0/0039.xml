Appreciation of the  Political Situation,  &quot;by  theGovernment of India, dated  17th April 1936.       Circulated for the information  of the  Cabinet  bythe Secretary of State for  India.
   Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation   in India, dated the 17th April 1936, issued on the   au&quot;thority of the Secretary of State for India.  1. April 1st marked a further step forward in theintroduction of the new constitution, for on that day thetwo new provinces, Sind and Orissa, were inaugurated.  2. During the last month the Legislatures have been in session, both at the centre and in the provinces.   In theProvinces local Governments have not experienced much difficulty in passing their financial and other proposals.The critics of the Government attribute this to the factthat councils were elected many years ago at a time whenCongress refused to adopt constitutional methods and contend that, as they do not contain a Congress element, they areunrepresentative of public opinion.   To admit the truthof this contention would be to admit that Congress and congress alone represent public opinion, a claim which is often expressed or implied by the Nationalist press and hasindeed been put forward by the opposition in the LegislativeAssembly.     It would be more correct to say that the provincialCouncils are more in touch with reality than the presentAssembly at the centre and have a greater sense ofresponsibility.   Thus, several Councils have passed without opposition such measures as the Executive have thought necessary to introduce for dealing with subversive movements.It is particularly significant that in Bengal during recentyears, the Legislature have accepted all proposals put beforethem for dealing with terrorism, and the claim that political prisoners and detenus should be released, which has been pressed so strongly in the Assembly, has hardly been raised in the province chiefly concerned.   Provincial Councils have
also busied themselves with questions of practical importance to their constituents, such as problem of ruralindebtedness, while in the United Provinces a most valuablereport on &quot;Unemployment&quot; by a Committee appointed by theLocal Government and presided over by Sir T. Bahadur Sapruwas fully discussed in the local Legislature.  3. That there is a considerable body of public opinionopposed to Congress methods and Congress policy is shown by recent elections to the local Boards in the united provinces.   In the local Board elections Congress wonover 50 per cent, of the Hindu seats in only two districts,in 24 districts less than 25 per cent., and in 21 districtsbetween 25 and 40 per cent.   This takes no account ofMuslim seats, which may be regarded almost entirely asnon-Congress.   Nor were Congress much more successful in the Municipal elections;  out of 73 Boards Congress will.have no representative in 25, and only one in 14 Boards:they also fared badly in the large towns of Agra,Cawnpore and Lucknow.   In Calcutta also at the recentelection for the Corporation, 13 out of 39 Congress nomineeswere defeated, and it is doubtful whether Congress blockwill have a majority.  4. The strength of various parties in the Assembly wasgiven in the third appreciation of last year.   There nasbeen no change in the position this year and on mostissues Government can only escape defeat if a majority of independent Party vote with them&apos;.   The Independent Partyseldom act as a party, but is a heterogeneous collectionof members, mostly Muslims, some of whom support theGovernment, but the majority of whom side with theopposition.   This being the position, it was not surprising
that certain token cuts were made in the demand for grants with a view to censuring the Government for their&quot;forward&quot; policy on North-West Frontier, and for their&quot;repressive&quot; policy in dealing with terrorists, while thewhole of the demand for Executive Council was refused asa vote of non-confidence.   When the Finance Bill was underconsideration an amendment was moved to cancel the salt tax;though this involved a loss of revenue of 7 or 8 crores, no practical proposal was put forward for replacing it.Another amendment was also carried against the Governmentreducing the charge for postcards from -f- to -g- anna.      It was urged that this proposal Benefited the poorman, and the opposition paid little attention to the    .....                                                    .contention of the Government that the actual benefit to theindividual villager was extremely small, and that loss of50-60 lakhs a year would upset their financial position.It thus became necessary for the Government to fall back onthe safeguards provided in the Constitution, and the finance bill was passed by exercise of the power of &quot;certification&quot;;in the course of the debate the honourable Finance Membertook the opportunity of reminding the Assembly that thosesafeguards were intended by Parliament to be real and to beused if and when necessary, and that in the three vitalmatters of defence, law and order, and finance the Governmentcould not divest themselves of responsibility and accept theopinion of the Legislature In each and every case.      Another debate of great importance was on the ottawa agreement.   Government proposed to appoint a committee toexamine the whole position and see what changes weredesirable in the interests of India.   The oppositioncarried an amendment demanding the immediate denunciation of the existing agreement, and referring in somewhat  vague
t\ T&quot;&quot;J ,terms to the- conclusion of Bilateral agreements with othercountries.   They were undoubtedly actuated mainly by political motives.      Government were also defeated by a small majority ona motion for adjournment to discuss the action which theyhad taken in regard to Mr. Subhas Bose.   Mr. Bose had been warned that if he returned to India he would not be allowedto remain at liberty, a warning which he had recentlydisregarded.   The justification for his detention underBegulation III of 1818 is that Mr. Bose has always been very closely connected with terrorists in Bengal, in particularwith dangerous Yuganter party.   He was therefore arrestedin January 1932, because ofthis association and not becauseof the support he was giving to the civil disobedience movement.   He was allowed to go to Europe for reasons ofhealth about a year later and while he has been in Europethere have been clear indications that he favours massrevolutionary action.   If at liberty, his presence in bengal, or even in any place in India, would undoubtedlyencourage the extreme left wing.  5.  When His Excellency the Viceroy visited the Legislaturesto deliver his final speech the Congress opposition againabsented themselves and much sympathy was felt by supporters of the Government at His Excellency&apos;s expression of regret at the concerted discourtesy which the opposition had shown on this and other occasions to him as representative of theKing-Emperor.   In his speech His Excellency reviewed thehistory of the last five year&apos;s and was able to show theprogress which India had made in that period.    India,  he pointed out, was a more peaceful and, therefore,  a happierand more prosperous country than in 1931-32 when civildisobedience and terrorism were rampant,  -while there had been
a very marked improvement in its financial position and credit.        lord Willingd.cn1 s departure from India on thecompletion of his term of office has &quot;been the occasionmany remarkable demonstrations of the affection andrespect in which he is held.
