       On the 16th March, 1936, the Cabinet (Cabinet- 20(36) Conclusion l)  discussed a proposal to sendBritish Troops to form $art of a possible international force in the Rhineland, and agreed -       51 (a)  That the question should be            examined at once by the Chiefs of            Staff Committee, who should be            asked to report on the military            aspects of the proposal as soon            as possible,  as it would probably            be necessary  for the Secretary of            State for Foreign Affairs to refer            to it in his  conversations with            French Ministers on the following            day. &quot;2.      We have examined this question and submit thefollowing views.3.      There are, of course, risks in the proposal,which we have referred to in more detail later, but wefully appreciate that in present circumstances risksmust be undertaken to avoid the dangers of war;  weconsider that if it can be established with reasonablecertainty that the despatch of a &quot;symbolic&quot; force is really needed in order to preserve peace, that risk is acceptable.                     -1-(THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY  OE HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S  GOVERNMENT.)

4,     it will &quot;be realised that any force that can be sent from this country will be purely symbolic, it is quite impossible to send troops which could prevent, by force, theoutbreak of hostilities,.   The role of the force being asset forth above, it would, not be desirable, even if it were possible, to send forces of all arms.   It is clearly a case where the use of Infantry only is appropriate - possibly afew mechanised Cavalry.   Infantry despatched from this country would be at peace strength and would, riot be equipped for warby the addition of those weapons and auxiliary arms, e&apos;..g.anti-tank guns, armoured cars, tanks, etc. which they would need ii they were  expected to be engaged in War.5.     As a very rough and provisional calculation it isestimated that a force of 5 Brigades (he, 20 Battalions)would be needed in order to &quot;show the flag1&apos; over so long acommon frontier, which extends from Basle in the South toAachen in the North, but excludes the common frontier between germany and Luxemburg.6.     In order to provide 5 Infantry Brigades it would benecessary to call upon troops which have up to now not been drawn upon so that we might have in this Country the nucleus of a small field force in case of possible eventualities.If, therefore, this force is to be sent it will be at theexpense of our power to send a Field Force overseas.    Infact it can be said that if war were to break cut, we shouldnot be able, with this prior commitment, to mobilise any force with which to reinforce France or Belgium on land for aconsiderable time.   Not only that, but to the extent to whichwe may send troops to the Rhineland our capacity for reinforcing any points in the Empire, which some other
emergency may expose, will &quot;be correspondingly reduced,and at a time when the most efficient part of our military strength is committed in the Mediterranean.7.     It is impossible, as yet, to determine the precisedepth of the zone in which the international force shouldbo situated, though we understand that the general proposals is that it should be placed in approximately equal numberson each side of the common frontier.   On the Rhine itself,the zone would presumably be non-existent as the Frenchfortifications are on the banks of the Rhine.    The Frenchundoubtedly would not withdraw from any fortifications theymay have on the western bank, and it might be that theinternational force in that case would merely be holdingthe ends of the various bridges over the Rhine.   West ofthe Rhino, where the frontier divides the Gorman Palatinatefrom Alsace Lorraine, the French fortifications are perhapssome 8-10 kilos, and in some places more, behind thefrontier, and in areas where that applies it would be possibleto have a neutral zone, on each side of the frontier, ofabout this depth.   The frontier with Luxemburg can presumablybe omitted, but the frontier with Belgium would nave to betreated in the same general way as the Franco-German frontier.It is not possible to bo more definite than this withouta much closer investigation of the problem and examinationof the precise positions held by the French, Belgiansand Germans at the present time.
8.     The question of the participation of troops of other nations in the international force is largely a politicalmatter? although we note that Herr Hitler has said thathe would not he averse to the inclusion of a Swedishcontingent o   It is possible that the inclusion of an italian contingent would not be  acceptable to the Germans,and the other alternatives are Switzerland (who refusedto send a contingent to the Saar) and Holland0   Whilstpolitical considerations must be of first importance inthis connection,  we wish to record our opinion,  based onexperiences in the Saar,  that from the military point ofview the fewer nations that take part, the easier is theproblem of command and control.9.     The degree to which other nations participate will naturally affect the size of the contingent required fromthis country,  but in any case we lay great stress on thedesirability of our providing the major part of the forceand the Commander--in-Chief of the whole force.   We couldnot recommend the  despatch of a small British contingent to be commanded by an officer of another nationality, inthe very difficult circumstances in which the international force will be placed.10o    Apart  from the very delicate task which the troops will have to  perform,  it  may well be that they will becalled upon to keep the peace in the frontier zone fora considerable period,  and when the time comes for with-drawal, the execution of  that withdrawal will probablynecessitate a good deal of tactful handling.
llo     In conclusion, we appreciate that it may be necessaryto accept the risk of placing British troops in a difficult and even dangerous position.   From a military point ofview we are of opinion that these risks, considerablethough they undoubtedly may be, are worth accepting ifthey are calculated to avert the alternative of war.This latter event would, of course, be a disaster forwhich the Services with their existing commitments inthe Mediterranean are totally unprepared.   As already stated, however, we consider it essential that Britishtroops should preponderate and that the whole force should be under the command of a British Officer.
