THISJXOUMSNT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS GOVERNMENT.                                                             COPY NO i   j^U$CRET.C.P.102(36).CABINET,RECRUITING FOR THE ARMY.            Memorandum by the M.hister of Labour.1*   The Secretary of State for War has circulated a memorandum (c.P.92(36))on this subject, in paragraph 12 of which reference is made to the policyof my Department in regard to the encouragement of enlistment into the Army.I am glad that he has done so because certain recent criticisms have made it desirable that the matter should be fully ventilated and while I holddefinite views on the matter it is necessary that the position which theExchanges occupy in this matter should be understood and approved by theCabinet as a whole02a   It is correct,  is the memorandum indicates, that the Employment Exchangesdo not display the ordinary recruiting posters nor take the initiative in recommending young men to join the Army.   The reasons for this policy,which was carefully considered and approved on more than one occasion by mypredecessors in office, were fully set out in correspondence which took placein 1920 between Mr. Winston Churchill and Sir Robert Home, and again in 1933between Lord Hailsham and Lord Rushcliffe (then Sir Henry Betterton).I cannot do better than quote the following paragraph from Lord Rushcliffefsletter:-       &quot;The Exchanges are intended as the national agency for finding        employment in civilian occupations, and it is important to preserve        their civilian character.   Moreover, it has been an important        part of our policy in recent years to develop the Exchanges on        specialised lines and to emphasize their particular function of        rendering service to industry in the organisation of the labour        market.   Recruitment for the Forces is a different matter with        which the Exchanges have no connection in the public mind, and I        am sure that it would prejudice their usefulness and arouse        controversy if it could be alleged that as they cannot under the        present conditions find civilian jobs for all their clients they        were being used to induce men to join the Army.&quot;I have recently recapitulated the considerations governing theMinistry of Labour^s policy in correspondence with the Secretary of State.
 3*    The practice at  the Employment Exchanges  is to exhibit a poster, the terms of which were  agreed with all  the Service Departments, concerning service in the Navy,  Army and Air Force *   The poster gives the addresses of  the recruiting officers and states  that persons desiring information may obtain, on application at the Exchange counter, booklets and leaflets about the conditions  in  the three Services.    When a man enquires, he is given the relevant information by the  Exchange officers.   These are the arrangements to which the Defence Departments  have agreed and which the Ministry has continued to carry out. 4o    While I appreciate  the necessity  of bringing the Forces up to the required strength,  I  think that the attempted  use of the Exchanges as recruiting agencies would not be  an effective  means to this end.    The Trade Union movement  and the  public generally  would regard with suspicion any extension  of the activities of the Exchanges in this fields It  should be borne  in mind that unemployed men attend the Exchanges as applicants  for civilian  employment and to claim unemployment benefit or  allowances.    There would be a public outcry if the idea got abroadthat  refusal to  enlist might  involve forfeiture of these benefits.   Itwould be  necessary  for an announcement to be made that no such forfeiture.would be  involved,  and the  result could not fail to be damaging torecruitingo50    The  requirements of  the  defence programme will impose  a severe strain upon  the  industrial  resources of the country,  and theEmployment Exchanges will have  to put out every effort if they areto be  able  to render the  assistance,  in connection with the  supply  oflabour for  the Government factories and for Government contractors,which  will be vital to the  successful completion of the programme,,This assistance will be incomparably more valuable  than anything whichthey  could do in supplementing the work of the existing recruiting
organisations, arid it would be disastrous if their power to perform this important service were impaired as the result of the suspicion and distrustwhich would inevitably be aroused by their more direct participation in recruiting active-ties.6.   I am therefore strongly of the opinion that it is essential in theinterests alike of recruiting for the Forces and of the effectiveness of theExchanges as civilian employment agencies, that the present policy under whichthe Employment Exchanges do not take the initiative in recommending men to enlist in the Forces should be strictly maintained.   The Ministry is,  as ithas always been, ready and anxious to co-operate with the Defence Departments tothe fullest possible extent, and I should be willing, if this would be  ofassistance to the Secretary of State, to arrange for my officers to discuss with his the possibility of the display at Exchanges, so far as wall spacepermits, of a War Office recruiting poster in addition to the poster which isat present shown.   The Admiralty and the Air Ministry may wish to discuss asimilar arrangement.  In addition, the Exchanges will, of course, continue togive all the available information on the subject the moment any man showsthat he Is interested.7.   I am afraid I see the strongest objection to the suggestion made by theSecretary of Sbate for War that army recruiting activities should be carried onwithin the Instructional Centres org.xnised by the Ministry of Labour forunemployed men.   The object of these Centres is to recondition unemployed menand make them fit for employment.   Recruitment to these Centres is voluntary,and their success depends entirely upon the confidence of the unemployed andtheir representatives in their suitability for their defined purpose, namely,reconditioning men for-  civilian work.   One of the chief obstacles met inendeavouring to persuade unemployed men to enter these Centres is the counter-propaganda of anti-militarist organisations which seek to prove that theseCentres are in effect merely designed to  prepare recruits for the militaryforces.   This propaganda has sought to show that the Instructional Centresorganised by the Ministry of Labour are comparable to the labour camps  inGermany, which are undoubtedly subjected to military discipline and designed to foster the military spirit and to produce recruits for military organisations.
I feel that it is essential that we should not-lend any support to thi^^j^iof propaganda, and that if we were to permit army recruitment activities withinthe training centres for the unemployed, we should run a very serious risk ofimpairing the value of these Centres without any commensurable advantage inthe numbers of recruits obtained for the military forces.   It is in my viewessential that the provision made for the unemployed by way of Training andInstructional Centres should, be kept entirely clear from any suggestion of recruitment to&apos; the armed forces.
