CONFIDENTIAL.                                         ft&apos;0&apos;  -                    BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL... &apos;                    STATE OF TRADE -  FEBRUARY,  1956.             Summary of reports  submitted by members  of the              Board of Trade Advisory Council  (Supplemented              in some cases  with statistical information              from other sources).   OVERSEAS TRADE.  Imports in February, at  62.3 m. were 5.9 m. more than in February, 1935.  Nearly two-thirds ofthe rise was in food and raw materials.  Of the increase of 2.16 m. in manufactured goods nearly  600,000 was in respectof non-ferrous metals and manufactures thereof.   Exports ofUnited Kingdom produce  35,1 m., were  1 m. more and re-exports,  5,65 m. , were  1.24 m. more than in February, 1935.   EMPLOYMENT.  The total number of unemployed persons on the    .....registers at 24th February was 2,025,021, a decrease of134,701 as compared with 20th January.     The main variations were:-       London........ - 10,222  North Eastern. - 29,957       South Eastern. - 10,095  North Western. - 54,547       South Western. -  9,277  Scotland ..... - 16,168       Midlands ..... - 29,788  Wales ........ +  5,353     The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-64 inemployment was 10,475,000 - 126,000 more than at 20th january and 378,000 more than at 25th February, 1935.     The improvement was most marked in the building andpublic works contracting industries;   there were substantial increases in stone and slate quarrying, the clothing(including boot and shoe) trades,  the cotton,  engineering,shipbuilding and ship-repairing,  tinplate,  pottery and brickand tile industries and the shipping service.   There was  anincrease in the numbers temporarily stopped in coal mining and a further decline in employment in port transport,  the distributive trades and the motor  vehicle industry.
   RAILWAY TRAFFIC - For the four weeks ended 23rd February,railway traffic receipts increased by  246,000 (2.33%)compared with the corresponding period of 1935.  The increaseamounted to 0.4% in passenger traffic, 2.2% in respect of merchandise, minerals and livestock and 5.3% in respect ofcoal, coke and patent fuel.   SHIPPING.- The Chamber of Shipping index number forfreights (1913 - 100) was 84.02 as against 90.64 in january and 73.59 a year ago.   Outward freight rates show no sign ofgeneral improvement and homeward rates, in certain markets,have only been maintained through the minimum freight schemes,.   BANKING.  Money was easy throughout February.  TheTreasury Bill rate fluctuated narrowly around 10/4d. until itrose to ll/2d. on the&apos; 28th.     The Dollar was weak at the beginning of the month, the spot rate closing on the 4th at 5.02-g-;  the franc also tended to be weak.  Around the middle of the month the dollar and                                 13franc appreciated to 4.98^ and 74 /^Q respectively, and the franc improved further on the grant of a sterling short-termcredit of  40,000,000. Forward rates for gold currencies wereweak at the end of February.     Gold prices fluctuated between 140/6d. and 141/2d. and                        7           1silvei&apos; prices between 19/-^gd.  ,and 20/^a.   FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROAD.   There was no very pronouncedchange in the financial conditions in the Gold Bloc countries,although bond prices have fallen and forward exchangediscounts have widened, owing mainly to political factors.There has been an Increase in the gold reserves  of the Centra,Banks, due possibly in part to gold shipments finding their way from Italy.   GOAL.  The average weekly output of coal during the 13weeks ended 22nd February was, 4,782,000 tons as comparedwith 4,586,000 tons in the corresponding period a year ago -an increase of 4.5%.  The average number of wage-earnersemployed was about 2% less than a year before.
     Exports in February amounted to 2,582,000 tons ascompared with 2,796,000 tons in February, 1935.  Exports toItaly were 292,000 tons less, and other countries takingless included France, Argentine, Belgium and Spain;  theprincipal increase was to the Irish Free State (147,000 tons)c   IRON AND STEEL..  Active conditions prevailed and are likelyto continue.     Pig iron output was 21% greater than in February, 1935.Demand for certain qualities was so strong that some producerswithdrew temporarily from the market.   Steps have been takento increase output but there is still some scarcity  .offoundry grades.     Demand for semi-finished steel was such that imports inexcess of the cartel amount had to be permitted.  The outputof ingots and castings (22% more than a year ago) established a record for February,     In the finished steel market the high level of activity,after a short lull, has been resumed.   Scotland.  Ingot -production continues to rise.  In the finished section some mills, hitherto not fully employed,are now working full time.  Consuming industries are busierthan they have been for some years and export business isimproving.   North East Coast.   Nearly all sections were busy, thoughplate mills could accept more orders and sheet manufactureswere comparatively poorly placed owing to scarcity of export business.   Sheffield.  Great activity prevails.   All basic billet&apos;plants are working to capacity.   Railway material producersare busier than for a long time.  Demand for tool steel isvery heavy.   South Wales.   Orders for iron and steel were satisfactory.Demand for tinplate and sheet bars was strong and tinplateworks were operating at over 60$ of capacity.  The market for structural steel continues exceptionally good.
   ENGINEERING.  The slight set-hack reported last monthwas merely temporary.  The volume of current businesshooked and in prospect shows no diminution.     Exports of machinery were valued at  3.4 m. as comparedwith  3*0 m. in February 1935.     MOTOR INDUSTRY,  The number of motor vehicles newlyregistered in January was 35,991 or 2,395 more than a yearago;  the increase in private cars was 952.     The production of private cars and taxis in december was 26,893 as against 24,509 in December, 1934.    Theproduction of commercial vehicles increased from 7,443 to,012.     Exports of new private cars and chassis in Februaryamounted to 5,325 and new commercial vehicles and chassisto,1,367, showing when compared with February, 1935,increases of 3.0$ and 30.2$ respectively.  Imports of complete new private cars and taxis amounted to 923, 36$less than a year ago.     LIGHT METAL INDUSTRIES.  The non-ferrous metal trade has recovered from the recent lull and a busy time isexpected.  The cutlery trade showed a fair improvement.Conditions continue satisfactory in the tool trades and thedemand for engineers1 small tools, etc. exceeds capacity.The foundry trade is fully occupied and the press-work andlock and allied trades are very busy.   ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.   Activity has been maintained andthe outlook is good.  The index of heavy engineering ordersrose further and reports from various districts indicatethat factories are working to capacity.   Consumption ofelectricity amounted to 1,824 m. units, an increase of23o4$ over February, 1935.                        4-
                                                      m     COTTON.  Activity declined daring February &quot;but is still at a higher level than a year ago.  Average weekly deliveries of raw cotton to spinners were 27.6 m. lbs. against 29,5 m.lbs. in January.  Deliveries of American and Egyptian ccttorfell but deliveries of Indian cotton increased.  American raw cotton prices were unsettled, and Egyptian and Indian pricesfell.  Spinners&apos; margins were reduced somewhat in the american and Egyptian sections.     Yarn exports (13*5 rn. lbs.) were greater than in any month since April, 1932; Rbumania, India, Norway and Braziltook larger quantities than in January.  Exports of piecegoods at 169o5 m. sq,yds. were 2.8 m. sq.yds, more than inJanuary, but 4,8 m, sq6yds. less than in February, 1935,  Ascompared with January, exports increased to India (by 4,6 m.sq,yds.), Norway, Egypt, South Africa, Irish Free State,Ceylon and Turkey, but fell considerably to British WestAfrica, Australia, Argentina, and French West and equaltorial africa.     SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.   The Rayon Yarn trade hasbeen very quiet but there are indications of improvementtowards the end of  4.prll.  The hosiery trade remains good,and the underwear trade shows improvement.   Business inpiece goods has been very quiet, mainly because of thenational mourning and the European political situation.Exports of all rayon fabrics and rayon mixture piece  goodsshowed considerable increase over February, 1935.     Silk business is also quiet.  . The price of raw silk hasweakened further.     WOOL.   There has been some further decline in generalactivity, though a slight improvement in the heavy woollensection.    New orders and enquiries are rather scarce.  Rawwool prices continued to rise.   The tendency for higher prices to restrict demand is likely to be more apparent  in theworsted than in the heavy woollen section.
                                                    *J 3- O                                                    si e) (j     Exports of  tops  and yarns decreased and exports of tissues-increased as  compared with January 1936 and with February 1935.     HIDES AND LEATHER.  Prices of hides were rather erratic during February  owing partly to the uncertain international situation.  On the whole leather business compared favourably with that in February of previous years.  Demand for sole leather continued strong and business in upper leathers was fairly steady.     POTTERY.  Home demand (except for china ware) was disappointing in January and February:  as regards glazed tiles and sanitary ware of fireclay, the slackness was probably due to  the bad weather.   Exports were higher than in January and February, 1935, but the increase was not enough to compensate for the decline in home demand.     CHEMICALS.  Home sales of alkalies were maintained at the January rate and exports slightly increased.  Home and export deliveries of chlorine products were appreciably higher.  The general demand for industrial nitrogen products was ma intained.   The advance in sales of dyestuffs continued.  The deficit in Home Sales of fertilizers this season as compared with last has  been substantially reduced: sales to Empire markets increased but foreign sales declined. Demand for coal tar products was  active.     PAPER.   Trade in general was well maintained, although there was a pronounced reduction in demand for miscellaneous printing papers..    The big increase in imports over the unusually low level of February,  1935, was mainly due tonewsprint from Canad.a and Newfoundland.    Scandinavian Kraft paper was largely sold, forward,: in anticipation of the increase in price arranged at the end of January.  As prices of Kraft pulp (which comes entirely from Scandinavia) havebeen greatly advanced for forward delivery and pulp supplies for early delivery are practically unobtainable,  the outlook is not regarded as satisfactory.                         -6-

All areas shared in the January improvement.Sales of foods and perishables rose by 12,7% and of  othermerchandise by 9.0$.   Preliminary returns for February showcontinued, thoxigh smaller, increases.     C0-0PERATIVB TRADE.   The sales of the Co-operative wholesale Society for the four weeks ended 8th Februarywrere 4.2$. more than sales a year ago.  The weighted  averageof the wholesale and retail prices of seven of the principalcommodities was respectively 7.17$ and 1.95$ higher  than ayear earlier.     CANADIAN TRADE.   General economic conditions in Jaiujhryshowed improvement though the index . of the physical volumeof business declined.  Nickel exports reached a post-warrecord for January.   Copper exports were lower than inDecember.  Imports of raw cotton were greater than in anyJanuary since 1927.  Production of pig iron and steel was higher than in any January since 1930.  Newsprint productionthough considerably below the seasonally adjusted level ofthe last quarter of 1935? was higher than in January 1935,     AUSTRALIAN TRADE,  2,4-39,603 bales of wool were received into store from the 1st February to the 31stJanuary last, as compared with 2,474,615 a year ago, the quantities sold or shipped being 1,774,537 and 1,403,188bales respectively.  Wheat and flour shipments from the1st December, 1935 to the 26th February were equivalent to31 m. bushels of wheat against 26.8 m. bushels a year ago.Butter, exports from the 1st July, 1935 to the 22nd Februaryamounted to 66,584 tons as compared with 84,740 tons a yearago&quot;.   Imports of merchandise during January amounted to  9.99m. (Australian currency) as compared with  7.92 m. inJanuary, 1935a
     Rains.have greatly improved the prospects for livestock in the grazing areas of Queensland and New South Wales.     SOUTH .-\FR*  Imports in December last were9,1$ greater than in December, 1934.   Exports (excludingbullion and specie) were 61,4$ more, due largely to a striking increase in wool shipments.  Gold output was slightly more than in November.  The drought was relieved inmost areas during January and dairy production is again at ahigh level.  The upward trend of activity in the manufactur-ing industries continued.     INDIAN TRADE.   Imports for February were slightly lower than for February, 1935j  exports were about 17% higher.Standing crops are reported to be generally in fair condition.The final forecast for the rice crop is 27.7 m. tons ascompared with the forecast of 30o3 m. tons for last year&apos;scrop,     SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.     Argentina.  The grain market has continued dull.  Abumper maize harvest is in prospect.  The wool market hasbeen quieter, with no improvement in priceso  The volume of fruit exports in 1935 showed a large increase over 1934,   TheUnited Kingdom&apos;s share of the import trade in 1935 was 21* 1$against 22s 5$ in 1934;  Japan&apos;s increased from 2.2% to 4,1$.The total value of exports in January was 15$ less than inJanuary 1935 (due mainly to the heavy fall in wheat shipments)but imports increased by 5$.     Brazil.  Shipments of coffee from the 1st July to the15th February were 30$ greater than in the correspondingperiod for the 1954/35 crop.  The coffee market was quiet butprices remained steady.  Cotton prices fell.  Total exports and imports in 1935 showed increases respectively of 19$ and54$ over 1934*  The visible balance of trade in Brasiliafavour was the smallest for many years.

Preliminary figures for the 1935 fiscal year show anunexpectedly large surplus.     Peru.  The cotton crop is making good progress and seemsto he of excellent quality.  The volume of cotton exports in1935 is reported to he larger than in 1934.     Colombia.  The coffee market has been active and prices have advanced,.
