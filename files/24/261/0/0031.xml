nOOUMENT IS  THE. PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT) .  -                                                    COPY  NO. R E T.101 (36)                    CABINET.              COMMITTEE ON THE .CORONATION.                    SECOND REPORT.1.     At their Meeting on March 25th, 1936 (Cabinet 24 (36)Conclusion 6), the Cabinet had before them our First Report -(CP. 76 (36)) and agreed inter alia that, subject to HisMajesty&apos;s approval, the month of May, 1937, should be fixed for the Coronation, that the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should inform the Dominions of this proposal, and thatthe Cabinet Co/remittee should meet again to maie proposals asto the precise date in May, 1937.2.     i*.t an Audience on the 31st March, His Majesty authorised the Lord President of the Council to inform the Cabinet thathe agreed to May, 1937, as the month for the Coronation, andthat as regards the actual date in May he would be pleased to suit himself to the public convenience and advantage.3.     The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs hascommunicated on the subject with the various Dominion Governments,No reply has been received from the Government of the IrishFree State, but from the replies of the other Dominion Govern-ments it may be assumed that they will agree to whatever date in May may be decided upon.4.   i  In our previous Report we suggested that the date ofthe Coronation should be Whit Monday, May 17th, 1937, and thatthere should be a State Procession in London on Tuesday,May 18th.   Confidential inquiries in regard to this suggestionhave been made from various important interests concerned,with the following results,                         -1-
5.     The Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations, the                                                        364Chamber of Shipping, the Dock Companies, the Banks, and trieCity favour the selection of Whit Monday for Coronation Day.The Confederation suggest that steps should be taken to getthe Scottish Spring holidays fixed &quot;by all the various local-ities on Whit Monday, and that the holiday on Whit Tuesdayshould be confined, to London,   Their object is to avoidan extra holiday except in London because it involves lossof a dayTs pay to workpeople or a holiday, with pay, at theemployers&apos; expense.6.     On the other hand, the Railway Companies, the Travel andIndustrial &quot;Development Association of Great Britain and Ireland,                 -the Northern holid.ay resorts, and Shipping Lines interestedin Canadian,  Australian and New Zealand passenger trafficare opposed to the Coronation taking place on Whit Monday.The Railway Companies state that Whitsuntide is the most difficult time in the whole year from the railway:trafficpoint of view, and that if the Coronation takes place onWhit Monday,  previous traffic experience will be valuelessand serious congestion and interference to the public will undoubtedly arise,  and that the choice of Whit Monday willalso have a serious effect on the seaside resorts.These latter  appear to favour a date towards the end of May.7.     Our original suggestion that the Coronation should takeplace on Whit Monday, with a State Procession in London onWhit Tuesday, was based on the desirability of minimising asmuch as possible the consequences to trade and industry(including loss of wages to workpeople) of additional bank and Public Holidays in or near Whit week, 1937.   In thisconnection it may be recalled that production on the Govern-ment&apos;s rearmament programme should be approaching its peakat or about that time.   Any interruption of work in theheavy industries may, therefore,  have serious consequences
from the point of view of national defence.           tswHi8.     On the other hand, further consideration of the -cues tier, has demonstrated the existence of great difficulties and objections to any date in Whit week.    To take advantageof Whit Monday in order that the Coronation may be held with the minimum of disturbance may tend to lessen the significance of the occasion,and might be regarded by many persons as an attempt unfairly to deprive the public of an extra holiday which they might reasonably have expected toreceive.  It is undesirable to have to declare Whit Mondaya Bank and Public Holiday in Scotland.   Prom the point ofview of the concluding preparations and arrangements at westminster Abbey, Whit Monday would be an inconvenient day.A day in Whit week later than Whit Monday (say Thursday,May 20th) would be open to such grave objections, particular-ly from trade and industry, that we could not recommend theCabinet to entertain it.9.     In these circumstances we have examined an alternative proposal, namely that the Coronation should take place onthe Thursday (May 13th) of the week preceding Whit week, andthat the State Procession through London and the ThanksgivingService at St. Paul&apos;s Cathedral should take place on saturday, May 22nd.   Under this proposal the great strain on His Majesty and all others concerned of holding theState Procession on the day immediately following the coronation. Day would he avoided.   If this suggestion were adopted, it would only he necessary to declare Coronation Day (Thursdays May 13th&quot;) a Bank and Public Holiday throughout theUnited Kingdom.   This suggestion would be quite satisfactoryso far as Scotland is concerned.   While trade and industrystrongly favour Whit Monday for the Coronation Day, weunderstand that if this is found to be impracticable theyWould much prefer Coronation Day to be the Thursday beforeWhit week rather than the Thursday in Whit week,
lOo    We submit the  following conclusions to the Cabinet      (l)  We  recommend the Cabinet to approves  for          submission to His Majesty9  Thursdays  13th          May5  or failing that day -  Whit Monday,          17th May0    These appear to be the only          two practicable dates in Mays  1937o      (2)  That?  while the day fixed for  the          Coronation should be declared  a Bank  and          Public Holiday throughout the  United          Kingdoms  it is unnecessary  to  declare a          second Bank or Public Holiday  for other          ceremonies (such as the  State  Procession)          connected  with the Coronation., which          might  conveniently taice  place  on a Saturday.Signed on behalf of the Committee    J, RAMSEY MACDONALDo          Chairman 0Whitehall Gardens9  S.l.lj 7th Aprils 1936*
