CABINET,                               PALESTINE.                ESTABLISHMENT OF A LEGISLATIVE  COUNCIL.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    IN connection with the proposals referred to in my Memorandum CP. 87 (36)of the 21st March, and in view of the discussion in  Cabinet last week following the debate in the House of Commons on Tuesday, the 24th March, I now circulate for the consideration of my colleagues the enclosed copies of telegraphic correspon-dence which I have had with  the High Commissioner for Palestine.                                                (Initialled)       J. H. T.    Colonial Office, Downing Street,          March 30, 1936.                                 ANNEX.  &apos;1. Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for  the Colonies to the                      High Commissioner for Palestine.                                                           March 6,1936.    IMPORTANT.   Private and Secret.    Question will be asked on the 11th March in the  House of  Commons as to-present position  in regard to establishment of Legislative Council and whether will  agree to a Commission being  set up to  enquire  into the constitutional problem in Palestine before such a step is taken.  This question links up with asuggestion made in debate on 26th February in House of Lords, of which I have sent you a copy  in my air mail despatch No.  238 of 2nd March.  In House ofLords  debate, as  you will see,  there  was  not a  single speaker  who supportedproposals of Government. So far as I can at present  judge, members of Houseof Commons interesting themselves in this matter will probably be under influence of Jewish propaganda.   Apart from these, the attitude  of most other membersis  one  of indifference.   I see no sign that opinion based on consideration ofnon-Jewish interests will find expression.    I propose to say in reply to question for 11th March that I do not feel thatthe appointment of a Commission would now be justified and that, in any event,no further step can be taken until I have received a final report from you on the reception given to the  Governments proposals by leaders in  Palestine.    I expect that there  will be  a demand for discussion of the matter beforeOrder  in Council setting up Legislative  Council  is  passed (see last part ofCunliffe-Lister&apos;s  answer to  Lieutenant-Colonel  Todd 21st December,  1934).Natural opportunity for  such discussion will be on Colonial  Office Vote, whichmay be taken as late as the end of July.  Assuming that Arab replies are satis-factory so that we can proceed with our proposals, would  you anticipate  anyembarrassment locally if  Order in Council is not finalised and passed until afterJuly ?  We have not attempted to make out a time-table, but in any event consider-able time, as it seems to me, will be wanted to get all the instruments into final       [12981]                               &quot;                      B
shape.  It would certainly help me to be able to say, if pressed for a discussion,that the Order in Council will not be passed until there has been an opportunityfor discussion on the Colonial Office Vote.    As regards  House of Lords, your communique regarding the scheme for  a council (which has already been put in Library of House of Commons) is beingmade available and debate may take place  at any time.    No doubt you will be sending me by despatch the replies of the Arab leaderswith an analysis and your considered views upon their comments or  suggestions.It would be convenient if I had some idea when your despatch is likely to  arrive,but I do not wish at all to hurry you over  this.    What, most of all,  I  should like is to be able to have a full talk with youafter I have received your report.   It would, I feel sure, be undesirable to suggestthat you should come home now for that or  any other purpose, as this would giverise to all sorts of rumours.   But it occurs  to me that you might think it  appro-priate to go to Geneva yourself this year as Accredited  Representative when thePermanent Mandates Commission  take the Palestine and Trans-Jordan Report.Having regard to developments during the  last year, especially the proposals forthe establishment of Legislative Council, your presence  at Geneva might well bejustified, and I  am sure that the  Commission would  appreciate your, going.   Iunderstand that the Palestine and Trans-Jordan Report is to be taken  by theCommission on 1st  June.   If you were to  decide to go to Geneva,  it would be reasonable for you to come home in early part of May and, as it would be  publicproperty that you were coming specially to attend the  meeting at Geneva, thereshould be no ground for inconvenient rumours.    I should be  grateful if j^ou  could let me have early reply to this telegram.2. Paraphrase Telegram  from  the  High  Commissioner  for  Palestine  to  the                     Secretary of State for the Colonies.                                                            March 9, 1936.     IMMEDIATE.  Private and Secret.     Your telegram Private and Secret of the 6th March. I am grateful to you for keeping me informed of the trend of events.     As regards the Parliamentary question,  11th March, I agree with the answeryou propose to  give, but I suggest that it might possibly be advisable to add  thewords &apos;&apos; nor is it at present called for &apos;&apos;  after the words &apos;&apos; Commission would  notbe justified &quot; ; and the words &quot; which the High Commissioner is now submitting &quot;after the words &quot;the leader (s) in Palestine.&apos;&quot;&apos;  I appreciate the difficulties withwhich His Majesty&apos;s Government will be faced if in both Houses a majority  arehostile to  the Government proposals and press for  the  appointment of a special commission. But could  it not be pointed out with some force that  we  are nowimplementing the undertaking to set up a Legislative Council contained in  the1930 White  Paper, which was itself given after a detailed enquiry had been madeby a Special Commission; that the Commission was presided over by an eminentChief Justice  and contained  two Members  of Parliament,  and that it  would therefore be superfluous to appoint another Commission ?    I remain convinced that, in the interest of Great Britain and Palestine,  weshould proceed  with the present proposals, mainly, as I have consistently urged,on account of the clear pledge given in 1930 by His  Majesty&apos;s Government which,on instructions  from your predecessor and the then  Prime Minister, was repeatedby me at Geneva  in 1932, and again with your own authority in Palestine inDecember last.    I realise that discussion must take place both in the Lords and Commons onthe Government proposals, and I do not anticipate embarrassment if the final issueof the Order in  Council is delayed until after July, provided that nothing is saidthat might give the Arabs the impression that the introduction of the LegislativeCouncil is being delayed intentionally.  I see no objection to your informing theHouse of Commons that you do not think that it will  prove practicable for theterms of  the Order in Council and complicated subsidiary instruments to  besettled until the middle of  the summer  and  that before then the House will begiven an opportunity for  discussion.    I have sent by air mail of 7th March a despatch analysing leaders&apos; criticism of Legislative Council proposals and my  answer thereto. Despatches will be sent
by ordinary mail of 14th March in reply to your despatches, Secret, 23rd december and 27th January.    There are certain advantages in your suggestion that I should come home inMay.  I am led to believe from your letters during last six months that you have confidence in my  character and judgment.  I am therefore encouraged to speakfreely and frankly.   If,  as  I hope, it is a certainty that  our proposals for a legislative Council as promised to Arabs will be carried through without altera-tion, I shall readily come  to  London  and go to Geneva.  But if there is any possibility of these  proposals as they stand not being carried through by Govern-ment, I  give  you  my considered opinion  that to  do so  would  lead to most fortunate results. I admit that many men who hold similar positions to mineover-estimate their  own influence.  During these last four years I have made ahabit to seek and listen not only to opinions in favour but also to those bitterlyopposed to my policy. I believe, and my British advisers also believe, that I have some influence on events, and that while Arabs have little faith in  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment,  chiefly because  of the  Balfour declaration and  obstacles to Arabindependence, they  have trust in my honesty of purpose and goodwill.  I believeI have a definite influence  for good both in creating hope that Arab interests will still have fair consideration  by His Majesty&apos;s  Government and in maintainingorder.    If I were to have conversations with you in May  and if, after those conversa-tions, our published proposals for Legislative Council were to be  withdrawn  ormodified by His Majesty&apos;s Government, both belief in my goodwill and  in mypower would be most seriously reduced.  As I told Arab leaders last November inmy reply to their  chief demands, the main questions of policy are decided by HisMajesty&apos;s Government after consideration of my advice.  The  advice that I have consistently given,  namely, that His Majesty&apos;s  Government should fulfil  theirpledges of 1930 is known to both Arabs and Jews.    I shall loyally carry out as High Commissioner the decisions of  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment,  but it must not  be thought that  if any modifications  are madecontrary to what  I  have publicly stated they have been made in accordance with my advice.    Nor do I see that there is much need for these talks in early summer as  to obviate their  possible drawbacks.    We  are both  in agreement that best course is to proceed with  proposalsformerly approved by Cabinet. If His Majesty&apos;s Government were, however,  towithdraw the present  pi&apos;proposals  under adverse criticism in  Parliament,  then,beyond acting as  an official mouthpiece, the less I am identified with such with-drawal the better for this country and my  influence in it.    The same argument would apply  to my going to Geneva,. though with lessforce.  In Geneva, in 1932, I  stated that the Legislative Council would  be offeredafter arrangements had been made for  Municipal Councils to function.  If I canrepeat statement definitely, and provided that Palestine is quiet, I see no specialobstacle to my attending Geneva.  Unless, however, I can clearly reaffirm that thispledge will be carried out, I submit that it will be wiser for the accredited i^epre-sentative to be someone else rather than the High Commissioner.   Not so muchbecause of reactions in Geneva as because of reaction in Palestine among Arabs.    I dislike assuming the role of a minor prophet, but it is my duty to add these points:     1.  If our proposals are not  adhered to civil disobedience disturbances are           almost certain  to result,  and particularly so  in view of the appai^ent          success achieved by disorder in Syria and  student rioting in Egypt.    2.  If we carry out our  proposals, it is possible, but I think  unlikely, that           demands may be made by Arab members as to immigration and powers-           of Council, which we shall  have to refuse, and as a result  they then           may resign their seats.    3.  If an attitude  is shown by the House of Commons similar to the Lords,           the Jews who, as I wrote to Parkinson, might otherwise have opposed           Dr. Weizmann and refrained from a boycott of election, will probably           remain silent. Message ends.[12981]
3. Paraphrase  Telegram from the  Secretary of State for the Colonies  to  the              Officer Administering  the Government of Palestine.                                                          March 21, 1936.     SECRET and Private.                                                    ;     I have been waiting to reply to your private and secret telegram  of  the9th March, for which I am most grateful, until I had had time to study yourreport on Arab reception of our proposals as set out  in your secret despatch ofthe 9th March.     You will now have seen from replies given in the  House of Commons thatI have refused to entertain the suggestion of a Commission, but I think that  thepublication of your summary of the proposals  as a  Command Paper and  myassurance that the House would have an opportunity to discuss the matter  beforethe Order in Council can be submitted to  The King have had a good effect fromthe parliamentary point of view.     I am now going  to inform the Cabinet of the position in the light of yourdespatch of the 9th March.  I need not say that I welcome the frank expression of views which you have sent me in your telegram.   I  am entirely with you inthe matter  and  I shall certainly represent  very strongly to  the  Cabinet  thenecessity of carding on with our proposals if there should be any suggestion tothe contrary, which, however, I do not anticipate.    Personally, it would, I feel, be a great help to me  to be able to talk with youabout Palestine, as I suggested in my telegram of the 6th March.   Telegrams and letters go a long way, but I have not  had the advantage which Swinton andMalcolm MacDonald had of personal contact with you,  and I  feel sure you will agree that there is no really effective substitute for that.  If this can be arranged as incidental to  your going to Geneva, I should welcome it.   But there is  no immediate hurry, and I think it will  be best to leave it open for a little. In anycase, I expect to be communicating with you again after the  26th March, when there will be a full debate in House of Commons on Legislative Council proposals. 4. Paraphrase Telegram front the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the                      High Commissioner for Palestine.                                                           March 25, 1936.     IMMEDIATE.   Secret and Private.     Debate on Legislative Council, referred to in my private and secret telegram of 21st March, took place yesterday instead of next Thursday, and  this did not allow of prior reference to Cabinet. I am sending you copies  of Hansard by air mail  of 26th March.     Debate was opened by Wedgwood, and he was supported  by Sinclair, and  a definite  line  was taken  up against Government by all  subsequent speakers, including Churchill.   Clifton Brown, who made a very good speech, was the only supporter of Government.   While warm  tributes were paid to  yourself by almost every speaker, general opinion expressed in the House (and  I  know  that  it is shared  by other  influential members) was that  the pledges given by  successive Governments, including the statement which you were authorised to make in  1932-at Geneva, did not bind His Majesty&apos;s Government to set up Legislative Council within  any given time, that a much longer period of training in municipal government was required before a Legislative Council was  embarked upon, and that  the establishment of a Legislative  Council  in present circumstances  was much more likely to exacerbate relations between Arabs and Jews than to improve them.     In speech after speech a great deal was made of the unhappy position of the Jews in Germany and Poland, and the fear was expressed  that, despite any safeguards introduced, the Legislative Council would become  an instrument for defeating the intentions of the mandate and for checking the development of the Jewish National Home.   Further, it was suggested that our proposals would hamper immigration.  In this connection, reference was made  to suggestion  that  1,000 limit should be raised to  2,000, and I took the opportunity to assure the House that this suggestion would not be proceeded with.     Other subjects,  such as land  and Government surplus balance, were  also referred to in course of debate.
    Upshot of debate was to confirm my view that there is practically no support in the House for Government  proposals, and to-day Times leading article sharesthe &apos;&apos; misgivings &apos;&apos; expressed in the House.  In the debate there were clear signsof extensive Jewish projoaganda, but for all that I am sure there is serious doubt in all parts of the House as to the desirability of proceeding with the proposals.Government  is  placed  in  a difficult position  by delicacy of general politicalsituation.  Question is likely to be raised again on the adjournment in the Houseof Commons or at some other opportunity, and notice has already been given of afurther motion in the House of Lords.    Alternative proposals have been mentioned in Parliament as follows :     (1)  A  Commission  of  Enquiry.   As to this, see official report of questions           on 11th March and replies sent to you on 13th March.  In my opinion,           apart from  obvious  objections  to such  an enquiry the most  that           Commission could be asked to enquire into would be the time at which           it would be desirable to give effect to proposals already approved.    (2)   A Round Table Conference between Government and  leading Jews and           Arabs to be held in London, so as to remove discussions from highly           charged atmosphere of Palestine, as a preliminary  to the final draft           of the Constitution.    I shall be grateful for a very early expression of your views in  the light ofthe situation as described in this telegram.5. Paraphrase Telegram from  the  High Commissioner for Palestine  to  the                     Secretary of State for the Colonies.                                                           March 28, 1936.     IMMEDIATE.  Private and  Secret.     I  am grateful  for your secret and personal telegram of 25th March, which makes clear to me  present rather difficult situation.  I  remain of the opinionthat, in view of our successive pledges, we cannot now justly nor in commonfairness drop our proposals, and,  if owing  to Jewish pressure in London we wereto do so, this would have the worst possible effect on the Arabs in Palestine andpossibly elsewhere.  As I said in my letter of 12th February I cannot promise thatthe situation will remain quiet, but I fear that without the two measures of theLegislative Council and  Land  Sales Restriction, I  can promise that it will not.(See also my secret and personal telegram of 9th  March, last  paragraph, sub-paragraph 1.)     2.  On the other hand it is now clear  that the Jews at present are unitedlyagainst His Majesty&apos;s Governments proposals, and the Arabs but half-heartedlyin favour of  them,  and that little or no support for them can be expected from either  House of Parliament.  Consequently I  i-ealise that, while we cannot dropour proposals,  it will be difficult for His  Majesty&apos;s Government to go straightahead  with them at present..     3.   You  suggest in your telegram two ways out of this impasse.  Both are open to serious objection.  But after careful consideration I think  that the first would  be preferable provided that the terms of reference to the  Royal commission are definitely limited, as  you suggest, to the question of the time for introducing the proposals and provided that no Arab nor Jew nor sympathiser with one racerather  than the other were appointed.  It is, however, likely that, as our proposalsfor a Legislative Council  cannot be introduced at once, the Arab population wouldboycott the Royal Commission.    4.   As regards your second  proposal,  I have no doubt that the Jews willbe ready to attend  the round-table conference which you  suggest.   I feel sure that the Arabs  would refuse to  attend any such conference unless they could firsthave an assurance that if agreement as to  Legislative  Council were not reachedthen present proposals of His  Majesty&apos;s Government as to Legislative council would  be carried out without  further delay.   Consequently I certainly do not recommend this proposal unless this definite promise can be given.    5.   I have  said that  I realise your difficulties in view of the attitude of bothHouses of Parliament,  in going straight ahead  with  the  proposals of  HisMajesty&apos;s Government for a Legislative Council.
    You realise the dangerous situation that would be created in this country ifthese  proposals were to be di*opped.    The holding of a round-table conference is probably not possible as if promisementioned above were given the Jews might hesitate to participate, and the Arabscould not attend unless  that promise were given.    The Royal  Commission to consider  the  date for establishing  LegislativeCouncil is  a possible way to meet present  difficulties, but  not, I think, a very satisfactory one.  I therefore submit for your consideration a third alternative.    The Arabs regard it as a grave injustice that the Jews have been able toput their case before you  and others in London, while this has not been possiblefor themselves.  I suggest therefore  than you should authorise me  to  invite  adeputation of representatives of Chief Arab parties to  visit London and  putforward their case.  This would follow logically  on their presentation  of theirthree  demands in November last, when I informed them that questions of major policy must be submitted  to the Secretary of State.    If you  agreed to this and the Arab  leaders met you, then, if you  thoughtthat there was a good prospect of success, it would be possible for you to  summon a round-table conference, or if  not, to appoint a Royal  Commission to fix thedate when  the Legislative Council should be  established.   Arab leaders would,I believe, be ready to go to London provided that no mention was made at present of a round-table conference, of which they would present be suspicious.    6.  I have  spoken to members of my Executive  Council personally,  andthey are in agreement with gist of this telegram.o
