DESPATCH TO SIR ERIC PHIPPS, BERLIN.                         ?           ......       &quot;                                       /                                                            /                                   FOREIGN office                                      24th March, 1956.Sir,     Herr von Ribbentrop asked to see me this evening whenhe stated that he had a document which he wished to give onbehalf of the German Government and added that after I had read it there were certain supplementary explanations whichhe wished to give^     2.  Herr von Ribbentrop said that on his return to berlin he had had a very difficult task.  He had explained to Herr Hitler the difficulty of the position of HisMajesty&apos;s Government and emphasised to him the efforts whichwe had made to moderate the French position.  None  theless the proposals of the four Locarno Powers had come as agreat shock to the Chancellor.  His first reaction  had beenthat in these conditions it was no good attempting  to go on.He had wished to maintain the position that he had  made hisoffer as a whole, that the Powers had not responded and that therefore there was no more that he could do.  Finally,however, largely as a result, Herr von Ribbentrop indicated.of his endeavours, Herr Hitler was persuaded to adopt a more moderate course and to make one final effort to bring abouta settlement in the European continent.   The success or failure of that effort,  however,  must In a large measuredepend upon His Majesty&apos;s Government.  Herr von Ribbentrop,in his last interview,  had asked me whether His Majesty&apos;;sGovernment were really anxious to obtain a European settlement and I had told him Yes,   He had also asked me whether I thought the French Government were anxious for such a settlement and1 had told him Yes, subject to certain conditions.   (I  here                                             intervened
                                                  2.intervened to explain that the condition was that some agreement should be reached, to cover the interim periodpending the negotiations). The German Government felt in these conditions that negotiations could only reallybe successful if His Majestyps Government were able to induce the French Government to enter upon them in a spiritwhich would make success realisable.  To do this the FrenchGovernment must get out of their old. frame of mindaltogether and be willing to start on an entirely new basis.He felt that His Majesty&apos;s Government, who probably did not altogether share the French view about the need forinequality, were in the best position to do this.     3.  I replied that the German Government seemed to be             ...placing upon us an extremely onerous task.  After all, Herrvon Ribbentrop would recall that the proposals of the fourLocarno Powers indicated a very remarkable departure fromthe attitude taken up by the French and. Belgian governments in Paris.   In the proposals of the 19th March the GermanGovernment were asked to make three specific contributions -the Hague Court, the International Force and to refrain fromfortifying the zone during the period of negotiations.   Was Ito understand from this paper that the German Governmentrefused all of these requests?     4-.  Herr von Ribbentrop then launched out into a longdisquisition on sovereignty and explained that it would be quite impossible for the German Government to agree tomaintain their small force of 19 battalions in the Rhinelandopposite the very strong French forces whose numbers  hadbeen largely increased.   Herr von Ribbentrop maintained thathe knew exactly what the numbers  of French troops were  -  theygreatly outnumbered the German forces and France  had                                              mobilised
                                                     4% F*J f                                                   s.mobilised more men to add to their numbers.  This wasa situation which could not continue indefinitely.While the Chancellor did not wish to withdraw a contri-bution which he had made, not to increase the number ofhis troors in the Rhineland, Herr von Ribbentrop indicated that he would look for my help to ensure that the FrenchGovernment did not make the German position impossible by increasing their very large forces&quot;.      5.  I then told Herr von Ribbentrop that in thecourse of his conversation, I had been unable to find any means of meeting our immediate   difficulty.  What could weoffer France and Belgium which would give them thenecessary assurance to encourage them to enter intoconversations?  Was it really impossible for the GermanGovernment to say that they would not fortify for theperiod of the negotiations?  Even this would be a contribu-tion.  Herr von Ribbentrop held out no hope that theChancellor could agree to this hut he added that in fact the German Government could not build effective fortifications-tions in a brief period.  If this was so, I replied, couldnot the German Government give us the assurance that theywould not put up any such fortifications for the period of negotiations and thus meet one of the conditions laid downin the White Paper?  Herr von Ribbentrop could add nothing to his reply, but suggested that we might continue thispart of the conversation tomorrow.     6.  Herr von Ribbentrop then said that he thought oneof the most important items we had to consider was procedure.If these conversations were to take place,  and if they wereto have a chance of success, it was important, he thought, totide over the period of the French elections when politicians                                                     were
were in the habit of making speeches of a more violentcharacter than in normal times.  Had I any views as to how this was to he done?  I said I shared his apprehensionshat I did not see how they were to be met-.  We too hadbeen concerned about the period of the elections both inFrance and in Germany and I had hoped that it might havebeen possible to secure a fresh contribution from theGerman side to enable us together with our own contributions to tide over the period until after the elections. As tothis, however, we could not be finally certain now until we knew what the proposals were which were to be produced bythe German Government next week.     7.  Herr von Ribbentrop added that an advantage in encouraging the French Government to delay their replyuntil after the French elections was that after theelections were over the French Government could be expectedto be more moderate.  At the same time he gave no indication that after the German elections the German Government were likely to undergo any similar transformation.     8,.  Herr von Ribbentrop then described how theChancellor, who he said was a man who had more ideas thanmost, had suddenly determined in the course of the next fewdays, which he&apos; wras going to spend in various parts ofGermany electioneering, that he would produce a final and&apos;important document which might enable us to cooperate tosettle the problems of the European continent for all time.I was given to understand that this would be a monumentalwork and that it would take some time for the various governments concerned to examine it.  The refrain with which herr. von Ribbentrop accompanied his lyrical description ofthis as yet unwritten volume was that if ever it was to                                              receive
receive the consideration and finally the approval,which he felt sure it would deserve,  then Britain andGermany must co-operate together to induce the FrenchGovernment to receive it, to consider it and finally toaccept it.     90  In conclusion Herr von Ribbentrop stated thathe would like to see me again tomorrow in order that we might carry a little further our discussions of today.
     On 19th March the British Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, Mr.  Eden, gave Ambassador von Ribbentrop, who was then in London, the first cognisance of the draft of a proposal on thepart of the Locarno Powers.     After the receipt of this document the German Government were requested to state their attitude towards it.     In complying with this request the German Government feelthemselves impelled first to repeat the principles and the motivesfrom which arises the inward necessity of their attitude.     1.   The German Government, being convinced that by the Franco-Soviet military alliance the legal and political assumptions onwhich the Rhine Pact of Locarno was based have been removed, havedetermined for their part to restore at last their full sovereignty over the entire territory of the Reich.     They did not however order the German troops to march intothis territory of the German Reich in order to carry out a courseof action for, its own sake,,  but they considered, this action neccssarin order to provide for Germany the necessary conditions under which she could become a party to a new agreement in regard to a clear and reasonable organisation of peace in Europe.    This conditionwill at all times only be found in the complete equality of thenations which join in such a common action.     Therefore this German action of restoring at last the full sovereignty of the Reich in its own territory  cannot be separated from the agreements proposed by the German Government to the other nations for a general -establishment of European peace.     2.   If the other States and. Governments are ready for their$ote- - eoirjminicated- by Herr von Ribbentrop on           March 24-th, 1956.
part also to seek the way leading to such a new system for theestablishment of peace in Europe, they cannot reject forth with the elementary principles and the necessary conditions for sucha development for the future.   The following fact must be clear:Lasting agreements between the European nations with the aim ofreally guaranteeing peace can only be concluded in an atmosphere of sympathetic recognition and consideration of the natural equalvital and political rights of all the nations participating therein.Any attempt to Introduce a new system of order in Europe by theold methods of a hate-Inspired division of the nations into those with more and those with less rights, into defamed and honourablenations,  or even into nations which may dictate and others who aresubjected to these dictates,  must lead to.the same result because it would be begun under the old conditions,  which have provedthemselves to be pernicious,  i. e. the new order will be no betterthan the old.     It would be advantageous for future developments in Europeif all parties were to understand that treaties on the one hand,and dictates on the other, have a different legal value in the life of the nations.    The dictate will probably appear to the victorto be its own legal justification, but will always be regarded bythe vanquished as a violation contrary to all right, and be judged from this standpoint.    Only  treaties which have been concluded by parties with equal rights,  and of their own free will and freeconviction, &apos;can claim from both partners the same lasting andsacred respect.     By the restoration of her sovereignty in her own territoryGermany has only created the  necessary condition which will enable her to conclude such genuine  treaties.    For this purpose  and onthis condition the German Government for their part have presentedtheir proposals, and still abide by them.
     St  The proposal for a draft treaty which was handed tothe Gorman/Government by the British Secretary of State,Mr.  den, eon calms not one of the necessary conditions for thesuccessful organisation of a really lasting peace, since it isbased, in the first place, on a new discrimination which isintolerable for a great nation and on a further attempt once more to lay down. Germany!s inequality of rights with the other states.     If the German Government were to agree to this proposalthey would share the responsibility for its Inevitable results,a continued inner rejection of the huiriilating subjection imposedupon the German people under such conditions.     The German Government will, however,  not do this.     Ail historical experience shows that  it is impossible tobring about on such a basis a real and lasting peace which is suchbecause it is concluded of their own free  will and with equalrights by all parties and thus is respected by all parties.    TheGerman Government must therefore reject all the provisions of theproposals of the Locarno Lowers which are  liable once  more toinfringe the honour of the nation or to bring into question ordo away with its equality of rights.     4.  The German Government and the German people have themost profound and earnest desire to make an important  contributionto the peace of Europe after the restoration of the complete independence and sovereignty of the Reich.    They are  furtherconvinced that all attempts to bring about an improvement in thesocial position of the peoples in Europe by means of economicconferences will be in vain until it has become   possible to give to the European peoples and to the political and economic leadersthe feeling of unconditional and lasting security.   But  thissecurity can only be  provided by a firm peace  which is  guaranteed                                                          for
for a long period.     The German Government do not, disguise the fact that they themselves set more value upon this peace as one of the securestbases for a revival of the prosperity of the nations than on any assistance, support,  or-relief  etc.  which may be negotiated bymeans of economic conferences,&apos;     Acting en this conviction the German Government have  presentedtheir proposals for international discussion.    If, therefore,  theyare compelled to reject the proposal for a draft treaty presented to them by the Locarno Powers in all those points which affectthe honour and equal rights of the German nation, they believenevertheless, recognizing their co-responsibility for the  fate ofthe European peoples,  that they must comply with the suggestions ofSis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in order for their part,  bypresenting any possible new proposals,  to contribute t&amp; a  solutionof this European question.    For this reason the German government do not wish in this document to go into the details of the pointsrejected by them, but  they would like to reserve this procedure in order to bring this rejection of theirs into connection with anew and detailed proposal for overcoming the European crisis,  whichthey are determined to work out.    They will present this  to HisBritannic Majesty&apos;s Government with the sincere wish that  the  lattermay then succeed in finding in it a basis for starting those negotiations which shall bring peace  to the European peoples andfructify anew their economic and social life.     In consideration  of these facts  the German Government are bound to Inform His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government that since  inthis week they are making the final preparations for their electionsthey are technically not in the position to draw up so extensive                                                               a
document and one requiring so much profound consideration.They therefore consider it necessary to send Ambassador von ribbentrop to London once more on Tuesday 24th March for a  verbaldiscussion of a few important questions.    The German Governmentwill then present to His Brit  nic Majesty&apos;s Government theircarefully considered attitude and their positive  proposals  on
