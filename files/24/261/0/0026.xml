Memorandum by the Minister of Labour..1,   In paragraph 1 of my memorandum CP .57 (36) I undertook to have a considered memorandum prepared on this complicated and far-reaching subject.The following paragraphs are now submitted in accordance with that promisefor the consideration of my colleagues.2.   It will be convenient to summarise the plan recoanrnended by Lord Weir, and endorsed by the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements, of which an outline has been published in the Vftiito Paper (Grad. 5107). . The plan fallsinto three sections:-     (a) Production facilities of &quot;professional&quot; firms (i,e., firms whose         regular business is to supply the needs of the Services) should be         expanded to the limits of efficient control and administration;     (b) the State Factories, such as Woolwich,  Enfield and the Dockyards,         should be expanded and new ones constructed on sites chosen with         regard to the questions of vulnerability to attack and to the needs         of the Special Areas;     (c) a &quot;shadow industry&quot; should be organised;  under this plan arrange-        inents would be made with selected firms  which do not normally make        war-like stores for the laying down of the necessary plant and        machinery for a given output of selected articles.   This will involve        securing factory floor space,  designing  the lay-out of the machinery        and equipment,  and the erection of equipment for the immediate        production of a proportion of the  maximum proposed output.   The        Government would place orders to hie  extent required to  meet the        present emergency,  and in addition would remunerate the  firms  for        holding the buildings and equipment ready on a care-and-maintonance
                                                                                I3.   Lord Weir&apos;s plan contemplated that the requirements of the Navy and army should be met in the manner described above but that Aircraft should continue                                                                                1                  &apos;:.&quot;; -          ;-\--            ..:                -      .  - - .         ito be provided by the &quot;professional&quot;  aircraft industry.  The Secretary ofState for Air has, however, since announced that other engineering firms willbe asked to co-operate by undertaking orders for- aircraft.4,   It is recommended in the Sub-Committee1 s Report that co-ordination andthe avoidance of departmental competition should be secured by the PrincipalSupply Officers Organisation, with a final appeal to the Defence RequirementsSub-Committee where agreement cannot be reached otherwise.5,   It is a cardinal feature of tho proposals that the programme should becarried out without interference with; or reduction of, production for theordinary civil and export trade,6.   It is recognised that tho programme cannot be carried out withoutadditions to the supply of skilled labour, but this aspect of &quot;the problem hasnot been pursued beyond tho recommendation that the men should be trained bythe firms &quot;on the job&quot;,  and Lord Weir&apos;s warning to avoid the waste and misuseof existing skilled labour.   It may be that,  as Lord Weir estimates,120,000 additional men will be required for the programme, but until therequirements of the several industries concerned for skilled,  semi-skilled,and unskilled labour are known,  no conclusion can be reached as to thedifficulties that may be encountered in meeting a demand the very nature ofwhich Is still obscure.7.   The programme will involve severe demands  on the building industry forthe erection of new factories and additions to  old ones.    At the same time,as part of the programme,  the Army will be required to undertake a largere-housing programme, which in itself may impose a severe strain on the buildingindustry.8.   The equipping of the  new factories and the new extensions of factorieswith the necessary machinery will impose tasks  on the machinery manufacturers,for -which a considerable supply of skilled workers will be necessary.   Whenthe productive plant has been provided there will then be tho  problem  ofsecuring sufficient labour of the  right type  to run it.   In practice It willbe necessary for the manufacture of machinery for the new plant  to becarried on concurrently with the production of  munitions  with  the existing  plant,                                      2.
and the need for men for &quot;both of these branches of the engineering industry must be kept in mind,                                                                       3169.   In times of normal trade it would be possible for the industries concerned to undertake a moderate increase in production without dislocationbut an increase of the magnitude contemplated by the programme could not beundertaken without the turnover of a lax&apos;ge part of the productive power fromcivilian to military production, with the resulting diminution in the civil and export trade - a diminution which must not be allowed to occur.  It musthowever be noted that the four industries mainly concerned - building,engineering, iron and steel and shipbuilding - have not been experiencingnormal trade in recent years.10..  The building industry, after the depression of 1931-1932, hasexperienced a period of great activity and during the past year the demandfor skilled building operatives, particularly bricklayers and plasterers,has in many districts exceeded the supply*   Prophecies have been made fromtime to time that the end of the boom was in sight and that it might befollowed by a period of depression, but there is as yet no sign of this.   Onthe contrary, the information as to building plans approved suggests that thecoming year may be one of even more intense activity than-  the last.   even before the defence programme was announced the Department of Health forScotland was alarmed at the shortage of skilled labour for carrying out theGovernment housing programme in Scotland, and the Secretary of State forScotland and I have been considering whether it is advisable to meet therepresentatives of the building industry in Scotland to explore thepossibility of alleviating the position.  In England the difficulties,  thoughreal enough, have been less acute, but I ought to point out that it has beena matter of extreme difficulty to secure the building labour necessary forcarrying out the aerodrome programme, so much so, that the     Ministry havedecided that aerodromes for which the plans have not already been approved,shall be constructed of concrete instead of brick.  It will be seen, therefore that the plans for re-housing the Army and building the new factories presentconsiderable difficulties in the way of labour supply.   These difficulties will be accentuated by reason of the fact that the required barracks and aerodromes will be for the most part located in Isolated districts wherethere is no local supply of skilled building labour and where it is difficult                                    3,
to attract operatives owing to the lack of living accommodation,  the reluctance of ra.cn to travel in a time of labour scarcity,  and the relatively low agreed rates of wages for country districts.11s  The position of the other three main industries - engineering,  iron andsteel, and shipbuilding - has boon different.  All have experienced many yearsof depression and the number of unemployed men has &quot;been abnormally large.Apart from the heavy numbers registered as unemployed, many skilled men have gone into other trades and many engineers, in particular,  have found workin their own trade in foreign countries, particularly the  United States.During these years few apprentices or new entrants have been taken on,  asemployers have not had work on which to train them, and even if they had,the prospects were not inviting to youths and 3roung men who saw their fathersand their fathers&apos; friends unemployed.12.  During the last year or two there has been a great iiiip^ovemcnt in manybranches of the engineering industry, and numbers of skilled men who had beenlong unemployed have been re-absorbed into the industry.   Difficulty has been experienced in finding men for certain highly skilled occupations; thetrained craftsmen who are still unemployed arc to a great  extent elderly andmany have had no experience of the new methods of work that have been introduced while they have been unemployed.  Many of these men would require a spell of training to regain their efficiency, or of instruction in the new methods, before they could take their place again as fully productive crafts-men.  Owing to the falling off in the number of apprentices during the  leanyears, there is an insufficient inflow of skilled young craftsmen to talcs theplace of those passing out of the industry on account of age.  Progressivefirms are now talcing on apprentices in considerable numbers, perhaps as many as they can readily absorb, but the result in skilled craftsmen cannot  be fully felt for some years.13.  At the request of the Service Departments, the Ministry of Labour TrainingCentres have largely increased the number of their engineering classes, andhave laid plans for increasing them still further.  These  Centres, however,only turn out young &quot;handymen&quot; or &quot;improvers&quot; and cannot remedy the lack of highly  skilled craftsmen who must be trained in the factories by the industry itself.
 14,   The  revival  in  the  shipbuilding industry is more recent and less complete and there are  still  reserves  of  suitable labour.  Hero again, however, there was  a -practical cessation of  the training of youths and young men during the depression,  and a loss of skilled personnel to other trades, and the men still unemployed are in the older age groups.  This industry could have coped with a gradual increase in orders, but the defence programme will put a great strain on it,  though probably not so sovcre in the first stages as on tho engineering  industry. 15,   The  iron  and stool  industry has undergone a measure of reorganisation which has had  the effect of concentrating production in a smaller number of efficient units requiring fewer men in proportion to output.  The fact that it has been  necessary to agree to increased imports of foreign steel suggests that  the  productive  capacity  of those units is fully utilised.  Little difficulty has boon  experienced on the whole in meeting current demands for labour, and  there are still substantial reserves, although in the main, the unemployed men are in the older age groups.  Recruitment of personnel, however generally occurs  among tho lower grades from whom the more- highly skilled occupations  are filled by promotion.  It is not considered, therefore, that expansion of production  would, at least in tho earlier stages, involve difficulties in recruitment of labour.   Difficulties appear more likely to occur in  relation to the necessary expansion of productive capacity,  on which the question will  arise whether it would be more economical to  construct now units or to bring idle plant again into use.  In any event,  it might bo a matter of some time before production could bo increased substantially, and, in the meantime,  it might be necessary to make good the deficiency of supplies by further increases of  imports. 16.   Tho  position to be  faced is set out in the above paragraphs.   It is extremely unlikely that  the labour supply will be sufficient to  complete the programme  in any  such period as three years.   It will therefore be  necessary for each  Supply Department in the first instance  to  examine  in detail the proposals  for expanding  its own factories,  and at the  same  time to  discuss in detail with its contractors (both &quot;professional&quot;  firms and  firms of  the &quot;shadow Industry&quot;) the  labour necessary for full  production  from existing plant, and the additions to plant necessary for the  desired  output.  It will heneceseary  to ascertain  the labour requirements  of the machinery manufacturers
and to determine as accurately as possible the number and classes of workersthat will be needed to operate the new plant,17.  The Employment Exchanges will be able to place the factories in touchwith all the labour available to meet current requirements, but it will undoubtedly become apparent very soon - particularly in building and in engineering - that the supply of skilled men is not adequate to meet the wholeof the new demands.  It will, therefore, be necessary for each Supply Depart-ment to -settle the order of priority of its requirements and for the SupplyBoard and Principal Supply Officers Committee to settle priorities between theDepartments.  Difficult questions of iprinciple will arise, which it will benecessary to refer to the Defence Requirements Sub-Committee,  It may be thatthe shipbuilding industry (which owing to the r)ralongation of the depressionstill has a large reserve of unemployed men) will be able to proceed withcertain types of naval production at a greater pace than will be possible forAir Ministry and War Office contractors, and it will be necessary to arrangefor the delivery of supplies by the iron and steel industry and by accessoryindustries in accordance with the relative absorptive cajmcity of the firmsproducing the final products.  It would, for example, be necessary to securethat the steel industry gave priority of delivery to shipbuilders- - if theycould use the steel at once, while (o,g.) tank manufacturers could not.18.  While arrangements on the above lines will be necessary in order that theavailable labour may be employed, first on the work most urgently needed,  itwill be necessary to look ahead and provide for labour of the right quality tobe available for the subsequent stages of the programme.  It will, therefore,be essential to place contracts in the earlier stages in such a way as toenable and encourage employers to re-train the older men and instruct them inthe new xurocesses and also to increase the number of learners and apprentices.An insistence on maximum output from the commencement might deter employersfrom doing this and might cause a scramble for skilled men that would lead tocompetititon for labour between Government contractors and employers engaged on ordinary commercial work  Further, the engagement of adequate numbers oflearners and apprentices, though it might slow down production at the start,is essential for an expansion of productive power and an accelerated progresslater,                                    6.
 19.    For similar reasons it will be necessary to secure that the pace at which  contracts  are placed  in the early stages, and the times specified for delivery, are  such that arrangements may be made by the employers for the absorption  of  the less skilled men and for any necessary re-arrangement of processes.   During the years since the Great Vfer much has been done in the way  of the  development of machinery and of processes, and mass production on high-speed  machines tended  by semi-skilled labour is now carried on to a great  extent in  many  sections of the engineering industry.   In other sections high production  is obtained by means of powerful machines in the charge of highly skilled and responsible men.   The heavy demands of the defence programme will necessitate  and encourage further developments along these lines.   For this purpose employers will have to make the fullest use of the ability possessed by  skilled men, who should be employed only on the higher skilled work,  the less skilled processes being left to semi-skilled or unskilled men.   The  employers concerned are fully alive to this, and action has  been taken by their organisations. 20.    It maty be  mentioned that the recent experience of the Air Ministry affords examples of  warnings of the difficulties involved in a rapid expansion of production.    No doubt the need for extreme speed was so compelling  as  to preclude the economies in the use of labour that are essential to the successful completion of the large scale programme of national defence now planned.   The Air Ministry found it necessary to place large  contracts  with  firms  that had been used only to small-scale and experimental work and that  had neither the experience nor the plant nor the men necessary for  the efficient and economical production of the vast output demanded of them.   The result was a scramble for the highly skilled men,  which would be intensified almost to the point of disaster if indulged in by the contractors to all the three Defence Departments in the carrying out of the new  programme, 21.    In order to make the best use of available industrial and labour resources it will be essential to place contracts in districts  in which plant can be utilised with the minimum of dislocation of ordinary trade and in which there is a  supply of labour with the required skill, or at  any  rate,  with industrial  traditions.   In the North of England and in Scotland there  are many industrial districts in which there has,  as yet, been  only partial  recovery                                        7.
                                                                    ei it X from the  trade depression and in which there  is  idle,  or only partially- active, plant*   In these districts  there  are many unemployed skilled work- people j   many of them are in the older age groups and  probably their  skill has rusted to some extent through long unemployment, but it  could no  doubt be restored after a short spell  of work under suitable conditions.    Every effort should be made to utilise the works and the workpeople in  these districts.   In some cases it may be possible to re-equip the works with modern plant if the Government is prepared to regard the firms as part of the &quot;shadow industry&quot;  and afford the necessary financial aid*.   This  would render it possible to employ many local skilled men  who, on account of age and other circumstances, could not readily be  transferred  to other districts.   The utilisation of the existing factory  buildings is a particularly important consideration in view of the shortage of bricklayers and other types  of skilled building  labour which would zander the speedy erection of additional  buildings a  matter  of grave  difficulty.    Perhaps, however, the  most important  considera- tion is that the allocation of contracts to districts  that are not full up with private work  will afford the best prospect  of rapid progress with the Government programme without diverting firms  from their production for ordinary  private trade.    In this connection  it  should be remembered  that if private contracts  are turned away they may be placed in foreign countries, and trade  lost in  this way may never be re-gained. 22.    Enough has been said to  show that there is need  for the  greatest care and discretion in  the placing  of contracts.    It would be fatal to present the industries  concerned with  contracts beyond their capacity;   at  each stage the demands of the Supply Departments  must  be  adjusted to  the supplies of labour. As productive capacity is  increased  (and capacity includes man power even more  than material equipment)  the  volume of contracts should be increased. By this means  the maximum progress will be made with the minimum of friction.Even  so, it  is not possible  to say at this initial stage whether there is sufficient man power  of the necessary skill and quality for the completion of the entire programme in the desired  time if, as I imagine, the  Governmentadheres to the view that the maintenance of ordinary civil and export  tradeis  a vital consideration.23.   These problems vdll require the closest  attention of the SupplyOrganisation.    The labour aspects are clearly of the  utmost importance                                   .8.
                                                                   rfj  $                                                                   &amp; L &amp; and the closest co-operation with the Ministry of Labour will  therefore be essentialo    Such co-operation can ^probably best be  secured by the adequate representation of the Ministry on the Supply  Organisation. 24-.    One of the first  duties of  the Supply Organisation so strengthened will be  to  enter into consultation with the Employers Organisations in the industries  concerned in order to  secure  their views  of  the  productive capacity of their several  industries , the  circumstances affecting their ability to  absorb contracts,  and  the rate  at  which contracts can be  absorbed. Among  the matters to be discussed will be  the proper distribution of orders for  specialised products in  accordance with the productive  capacity  of the industries.    The Smplo3&apos;-ers  Organisations  would doubtless be able to give valuable advice on the  question of ancillary  and sub-contracts and would be able to  advise on the constitution of small committees  of the  kind suggested by Lord Weir,  which would  help the Supply  Departments to  maintain contact with the  sections of industry concerned* 25.    The goodwill of the  Trade Unions is  of  the highest  importance  to the smooth working and the  ultimate success  of the scheme.    They  have indeed much to  gain from it at the outset, as it  will enable a large  proportion of their  skilled members to be re-absorbed  into  indtistry,  but  there are already signs  that  they view certain  of its possible  effects with suspicion.   As has been pointed out above,  it will be necessary  for employers  to  adopt  all possible means of economising labour and making the trained ability  of the most highly skilled men go as far as possible.   If the programme afforded a prospect of permanent employment  for all engaged in the industries concerned, it would not be difficult to  re-assure the unions and secure their acquiescence in any schemes of re-organisation or development necessary  for the most efficient utilisation of all  degrees of  skill, but the  unions  are bound to consider the probable position  on the completion of the programme.    Large numbers  of  skilled men,  as well as of less skilled men newly introduced into the industries,  will then be  redundant and will find themselves condemned to unemployment for an indeterminate  period..   It is only natural, therefore, that the unions  should hesitate in agreeing to proposals that would lead to themost rapid  expansion of  the industry with the prospect of sudden and widespreadunemployment in  a few years.    The fear of such a result is  quite likely tomake them suspicious and obstinate, even in regard to minor  questions of
                                            .,,   &quot;                     323 current importance.    It will be  for  the Employers Organisations to discuss                ilj   &apos;                     : l&apos;&apos;,::                      I   &apos;&apos;&apos;.&apos;f:         i;l &apos; with the Trade Unions  all  questions of re-organisation, introduction of apprentices,  learners  and  other types of labour,  as well as  questions  of  the rate of wages, overtime, the observance of  fair wages  clauses,  and so  forth. The latter are ordinary matters of discussion between  the Employers&apos; Organisations and the  Trade Unions, but the discussions on them will be carried on in the shadow of the fears entertained by the Trade  Unions  as  to the future position  of labour in  the  industries concerned.    On these  major questions the employers will not  be able to satisfy the unions  by  promises of the complete  restoration of previous  conditions,  as experience  during  the years that have followed the Great War shows that, with the  best will  in  the-world, the clock of  industrial  progress cannot  be set  back and  that improved-processes, when once introduced,  have come  to stay.    Moreover, the Employers Organisations would  not be in a position to hold out any promise of continued employment after the abnormal Government demand had ceased.   While, there- fore, it is right to encourage  the Employers Organisations and  the Trade  Unions to .settle all possible matters  of difference by the normal methods of industrial negotiation, it is only to be expected that sooner or later one party, or both, will appeal to  the Government to intervene.   The  Government^ own position will not  then be that of a disinterested  outsider, as it  will be undesirable in the public  interest for the  employers and the trade unions to be allowed to fix wages at a level that would impose an unreasonable burden on the national finances.    Moreover, wages in the armament industries must not be such as would attract labour from  ordinary civil and export  industries in such numbers as to impair  their productive  capacity;   nor must  wages in these industries be forced up, in sympathy  with wages in the armaments industries, to a point that would  destroy their competitive power  in the world markets The Trade Unions, on their part,  will no doubt  press upon the Government  the argument that the men  deserve as  much consideration as the firms with  whom arrangements are made  for  the laying  down of special plant and  machinery, and that if the Government does not think it right  that these firms should be left in the lurch and allowed to suffer loss of  capital for&apos; having stepped  into the breach, it should  show similar consideration to the men  in  the matters beyond the unaided control of the employers.    It is not, of course, for  the Government itself to raise these  questions, but it is  as well to have  them
in mind and to be prepared to deal with them if, as will almost certainlyhappen, they are referred to the Government by the industrial organisations concerned with them  in the first place.26*    In  conclusion  it must be emphasised that labour is as essential forcarrying  out the defence programme as men are for the fighting forces.   Ithas  been  indicated that there may be serious difficulties to be overcomein the supply and the necessary distribution of skilled labour during theforthcoming years.   These difficulties, though grave, will not beinsurmountable if careful regard is had in the planning of the programme tothe  labour that can  reasonably be expected to be available.   This means thatan attempt to produce all the requirements at a greater speed than the labour supply will make possible will defeat its own endSo   What is needed, from thispoint  of  view, is so to plan the whole programme that there may be a steadyand  in the later stages a swift acceleration of production.   If industry isgiven  enough time it should be able to adapt itself to the new demands withoutseriously interfering with its normal output on civilian work.   Within ayear1s time much can be done by industry itself in the reorganisation of labour supply., which would greatly reduce labour difficulties and appreciably increasethe  effectives available for the programme.   If, on the other hand, speed atall  costs  is attempted, very serious labour questions will be thrown up at once,with all  the embarrassing consequences not only for the armament programme butfor  civilian industry.   In short, therefore, there is nothing in the picturefrom the  labour point of view which would make it impossible to carry out theprogramme  over a reasonable period and at a progressive rate of accelerationwith complete success.   If, however, the period is too severely limited, orthe  rate  of acceleration at the start too rapid,  the dangers of failure  arevery real.27o    It may perhaps be convenient for my colleagues if I briefly summarisethe  main points in this memorandum,  together with the questions which appearto arise  for determination.     The  re-armaments programme will involve the  employment of additional skilled labour for the construction of buildings,  the manufacture of the necessary machinery, and the production of the material.    The trades  particularly affected will be the building, iron  and steel,  engineering,  shipbuilding and                                         11.
 a number of other industries,  including the  chemical industry. .  Wo definite estimate of the  additional  skilled personnel can be made until the demand has   j                                                                                1 been more closely analysed  and ascertained.                                                                                1       In some occupations in the industries  affected there  is already a shortage of skilled workers and as the  programme develops this and other similar shortages will cause much difficulty.   The  skilled labour  available will be required not only for the re-armaments programme, but fcr civilian work;  it is necessary particularly to maintain, and if possible to  increase, the export trade.    It is therefore vital that the v/hole situation of  the supply of labour for both civilian and armaments production should be kept under continuous review.      It  should be a function of the Supply Organisation of  the Service Departments to regulate the distribution of  contracts and the pace at which they! are allocated so as at the  same time to utilise to the  fullest extent the available supplies of labour and plant and to avoid industrial dislocation. It will  be necessary to arrange an order of  priority within and through appropriate machinery between  the Supply Departments in accordance with the relative urgency of the need for particular  products.   The possibilities of progress with the work depend  upon the proper utilisation of labour supply, and for  this reason the closest co-operation between the Supply Organisations of the Service Departments and  the Ministry of Labour is essential.     The  problems involved in the expansion of the labour supply for a programme of vast  extent,  which must  be  completed in a limited period, will be formidable.    The Trade Unions will naturally be anxious, not only about the present  position of their members in regard  to wages and other conditions of employment,  but  also about  the fate of those  men who may ultimately become redundant as a result of the additions to the labour supply brought in for what they will regard as a  temporary emergency.    In the ordinary way these are matters  for  settlement  between the Employers Organisations and the                                                                                1 Trade Unions themselves, and for tactical reasons it is essential that this course should be pursued at the outset.   It  is, however,  practically certain that  the  Trade Unions will  press for Government intervention on questionswhich they will  claim are beyond the scope of negotiations  between the parties.The Government must be prepared to deal with the questions  that will  thenbe  raised.(Intd.)
