(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S (X)7ERNMENT )SECRETCP.  72  (56)Copy No.x3CABINET  PUBLIC HEALTH LAW CONSOLIDATION.Memorandum by the Minister of Health     1.   I desire to obtain Cabinet approval to the  introduction into the House of Lords of a Bill to consolidate, with amendments,an important section of the law relating to public health  inEngland and Wales.   The Bill, which is already drafted,is included in the list of Bills reported by the Home AffairsCommittee to the Cabinet on 4th December, 1935, (Cabinet 51(35)Conclusion 4).     2.   The Bill is designed as the first and principalinstalment of public health consolidation, and covers a wide field of subjects including sanitation, building byelaws,prevention of nuisances, water supply, prevention and treatment                                                                 ___iof disease and the provision of hospitals and maternity centres.It has no application to Scotland or to Northern Ireland,  nor,with certain exceptions, to London, which, as regards both localgovernment and public health, is largely governed by  a code ofits own.    - 3.   The Bill is based on the Second Interim Report of a departmental Committee appointed in 1929 by Mr. Greenwood,  withthe late Lord Chelmsford as Chairman, to consider&apos; and report onthe form which a consolidation of the law of looal government andpublic health . should take, and. the amendments which would  bedesirable to secure simplicity, uniformity and conciseness.The Committee includes three members of Parliament representingthe three Parties, and. representatives of the four associations of Local Authorities.   Copies of the Report (Cd.5059 of 1936)and of a draft Public Health Bill (Cd.5060 of 1936)  appended toit are annexed.                             1.                                  r
                                                          0                                                          t&apos;     4.   Since the publication of the Report I have submitted the draft Bill to the various Associations of Local Authoritiesand to the Government Departments and other bodies concerned.The comments of these bodies have been referred to theDepartmental Committee and upon receiving their recommendations anticipate making a number of drafting and other minor amendments in the Bill to meet the views expressed.     5.   The Bill; like the Bill for the Local government act, 1933; is not pure consolidation and cannot; therefore; bereferred to the Joint Select Committee on Consolidating Bills.As appears from paragraph 6 of the Report; the Committee found, itnecessary to follow the procedure successfully adopted in theLocal Government Act; 1933; of preparing a single consolidatingand amending Bill.   The 334 clauses of the present Bill represena re-enactment of some 600 sections scattered through some thirtyor forty Acts of Parliament.   The Bill; if passed; would effectan immense simplification of the law and should be of great value both to public health administrators and to property owners                                                                 Iand other members of the public.                        /                                                                I     6.   I propose that the procedure adopted in the case of 1. K&apos;.-.                                                                local Government Act should be followed and that after secondreading in the Lords, the two Houses should be invited to appoia Joint Select Committee to consider the Bill.  The general    &apos;*&amp;Mpublic are no doubt more closely concerned with the Bill than wit]the earlier Bill relating to local government, and for that     *                                                                Ireason I am anxious to introduce the Bill at the earliest possiKLmoment in order to allow time for the fullest discussion beforethe Select Committee.   I am assured; however; that the passageof the Bill will be welcomed by the Associations of LocalAuthorities and others concerned in local government and public^health; and I see no reason to suppose that the Bill will make  m                                                                1demands on the time of Parliament which might block the progress if                                                                 Iof other and more urgent government measures..7th Liar oh, 1936.

LOCAL  GOVERNMENT  AND  PUBLIC  HEALTH          CONSOLIDATION  COMMITTEE          SECOND INTERIM  REPORTTo the Rt. Hon. Sir Kingsley Wood, P.G., M.P.,                     Minister of Health.Sm,  We have the honour to submit herewith a second Interim Reportdealing with part  of the law relating to the  public  health.                     INTRODUCTION.  1.  Shortly after the publication of our first Interim Report inMarch, 1933, we learned with deep regret of the death of our Chair-man, the late Viscount Chelmsford, and we desire to place on recordour sense of the loss which the country sustained by  his death andour appreciation of the skill and courtesy with  which he preside over  our deliberations.  In  November, 1933, Lord Addington  was appointed  to  be  amember and  Chairman  of the  Committee in  place of ViscountChelmsford.   In consequence of changes  in the office of the Par-liamentary Counsel, Mr. G. R. Hill, C.B., was appointed to takethe place  of Sir William Graham-Harrison,  K.C.B., K.C., who retired from the public  service, and of Mr.  L. A.  J.  GranvilleRam, C.B.  In addition, the membership of the Committee was increased by the inclusion of Mr. Joshua  Scholefield,  K.C., andMr.  C.  L. des Forges,  the  Town Clerk of  Rotherham.  MajorJ. J.  Llewellin, M.P., retired from the Committee in July, 1935,ou his appointment as a Government Whip,  and  Mr. M. Petherick,M.P., was appointed in his place.  Since the Committee was thus re-constituted in November, 1933,it has held 59 meetings.  2.  As pointed out in paragraph 2 of our first Interim Report,our Terms of Reference fall  into two. parts,  the first relating tothe enactments dealing  with local authorities  and  local govern-ment, and the second with the  enactments dealing  with matters relating to the public health, and we were instructed &quot; to considerunder what heads these enactments should be grouped in consolidat-ing legislation and  what amendments of the  existing law are de-undesirable for  facilitating  consolidation  and   securing  simplicity,uniformity and conciseness.&quot;  The first part of our task was completed with the issue of our first Interim Report and the draft Local Government Bill which accompanied that  Report.   33141                                                A i
  It may be worth while recording briefly the  subsequent historyof the dratft Bill.  A Bill  in identical  terms, except for a fewcorrections made in the Schedule  of Repeals,, was introduced onbehalf of the Government  in the  House of Lords  by the LordChancellor on the 2nd May, 1933, and after the motion for SecondBeading  had, been carried without division ;was referred to a joint select Committee of both Houses. In  the meantime the Bill had beensubmitted, by the Department to the Associations of  Local Autho-rities and to Government. Departments concerned.   As a result ofobservations received from these bodies, ,a considerable (number of amendments, mostly of a minor character, were submitted on behalfof the Department to the Joint Select Committee.   The committees at  for-five days  examining the Bill in detail and  taking evidence from  Sir Frederick Liddell,&apos;K.C.B., K.C.,  our Acting Chairman,the Parliamentary Draftsman, and  the members of the Committeewho represent the Ministry of  Health and Home Office.   Sir HarryPritchard also gave evidence on a number of points with which theAssociation of Municipal Corporations were specially concerned. Asa result,  the proposed  amendments  were incorporated substantiallywithout alteration and a few other  amendments were made.   TheBill as amended was reported  and received a Third Beading hi theHouse of Lords on the 26th July.  It was introduced into the Houseof Commons on the same  day, received the Boyal Assent on the17th November and came into force as the Local Government Act,1933, on the 1st  June, 1934.                           &apos;                    Scope  of Proposed  Bill.  3. It will be seen on reference to paragraph 3 of our first InterimReport that in a letter  addressed  by Mr.  Arthur Greenwood  toLord  Chelmsford on the 8th December, 1930, it was indicated thatthe term &quot; enactments relating to the public health &quot; was not in-tended to be limited to the Public Health Acts themselves, but wasto  include  enactments  relating to  analogous  services  such  asMaternity and Child Welfare  and the Welfare of the Blind.&apos; we found it  necessary,  therefore,  at  the  outset   to  decide two questions        (1)  whether it  would be more convenient to consolidate the     &apos;&apos; enactments relating to  the public  health &quot;in a single Bill    or in a series of Bills;  and       (2) how much  of the existing law, though not  technically    part of the public health code,  could.conveniently be embodied&apos;    in the consolidating Bill or Bills.  As regards the first, an  examination of the  Public Health Actsshows that, in addition to  the provisions of those Acts which dealwith  the structure  of  local government and have now  been  incor-porated in the Local Government Act, 1933, they contain &quot;a largenumber of provisions  not strictly of a public health  nature.  The
various provisions of  the Acts may be roughly classified.under thefollowing  heads:       .    .           .,            -  V            .                             f .       (a)  provisions of a strictly public health character relating to    the prevention and treatment  of disease, that&apos;is,  as  regards    environment, to  such  matters as  drains and sewers, buildings,    water supply and the abatement  of  nuisances, and as  regards    personal hygiene to such matters as  the provision of hospitals,    maternity centres, etc.       (b)  provisions  with  regard  to streets and building lines;       (c)  provisions  dealing with food ;       (d)  provisions   dealing  with   public  amenities recreation    grounds, open spaces, etc.;       (e)  provisions  as to  the  licensing  of hackney carriages,    pleasure boats, servants&apos; registries, etc.;       (/)  provisions dealing with burial and cremation;       (g)  provisions  of a  &quot; police &quot;  character, e.g.,  offences  in    streets and places of public resort;       (h) provisions  dealing with river pollution.  4. To  deal with all the  subject matters grouped  under  theseheads in a single measure would,  we estimate, involve a Bill of notless than  1,000 clauses.  On consideration we are satisfied that thebalance of advantage lies in the  direction of several Bills,  each  of moderate  length.  A  disadvantage of  this procedure lies in the factthat it involves either reproducing in terms,  or incorporating by reference, in each Bill such provisions as are common to all.  this objection  is, however, to  some  extent met by the fact that theprovisions as to acquiring land, borrowing,  etc., are now comprised in the Local Government Act, 1933.  On the whole, therefore, weconsider that both from the point of  view of  local authorities andtheir officers, and from that of the public at large, a series  of Billsthe longest  of which  would not  exceed  some  350 clauses is more convenient  than  a single  comprehensive  measure.  Working  onthis principle we  have confined the present Bill to the matters  in sub-paragraph (a) above.   Which of the matters referred to in sub-paragraphs (b) to (h)  will call  for a separate Bill and which can beconveniently combined with one  or more of the others in a singleBill, are questions which need not be decided at the moment.  5. Having reached this conclusion, we  turned to the questionwhat legislation other than the Public  Health Acts themselves oughtto be included in the  present Bill.  The collective short title &quot; ThePublic Health  Acts,  1875  to 1932 &quot;  includes 16 statutes passed between those, years, but there are a number of Acts,  such as theInfectious. Disease (Prevention)   and  (Notification) Acts, and thePublic Health  (Tuberculosis) Act, 1921, which plainly fall withinthe expression &quot; enactments relating to the public health    though not technically, comprised in the collective short title.   These Acts
must clearly be incorporated so far as they relate to the subject matter of the present Bill.   On the other hand, we have felt clearthat though the expression &quot; enactments relating  to (the publichealth &quot;, if read  in  the  widest  sense,  might  be  regarded  as including Acts  relating to  such  matters  as  the housing  of  theworking classes and lunacy and  mental  deficiency,  these  Acts,which have always formed  separate groups of  their own,  should remain  distinct  codes.   We have accordingly  left these  sub-stantially untouched, and have limited ourselves to those Acts which deal with subject  matters closely  akin to those provisions of  thePublic Health Acts themselves which fall within the terms of  theBill.   On this basis we have included in the Bill the Maternity and child Welfare Act, 1918, the Nursing  Homes Registration  Act,1927, Part I of the  Children Act, 1908 (as amended by the children and Young Persons Act, 1932), the Canal Boats Acts and the Bathsand Washhouses Acts, together with a number of individual sectionsfrom  other Acts, e.g., Section 42  of the Burial Act, 1852, wherethe sections in  question relate to public health and  the balanceof advantage lies in incorporating them into the public health code.The Blind Persons Act, 1920,  on the other hand,  has not been incorporated for the reason that it deals rather  with the provisionof training  and financial assistance  for  the blind than with  pre-preventive or curative  treatment, these latter matters being dealt within a section of  the Public  Health  Act,  1925,  now  reproduced  in clause 178 of the Bill.   It is arguable that Section 14 of the Mid-wives  Act,  1918,  which imposes  oai county and county borough councils an  obligation to pay for the services of a doctor  called inby a  midwife, should  be included in the Bill,  but  the Mid wivesActs, 1902 to 1926, form a  code  for midwives closely comparable with the Medical Acts and the Dentists Act, 1921, and we came tothe  conclusion  that the better course  was  to leave that codeuntouched.  We also considered whether to incorporate the Public Health Act,1875  (Support of  Sewers) Amendment Act,  1883.  The  effect  ofthis Act is to apply the  &quot; mining code  &quot; as enacted in the Water-works Clauses Act, 1847, to  works of sewerage,  lighting and watersupply.  As the present Bill does  not  deal with lighting  it wouldbe impossible for  it to repeal and re-enact the Act of 1883 as awhole; and  for this reason and also for the reason that in practice the mining code only affects a small minority of local authorities, werecommend  that the Act should be left as it stands.                    Form of Proposed Bill.  6. In  paragraph  10  of our first  Interim Report- we set  out thereasons which led  us to  abandon the idea of drafting a purely con-consolidating Bill and  expressed the  hope  that in  dealing with the-remainder of our stibject matter it  might prove possible to proceed on the more  orthodox  plan of a  relatively short amending Bill,
15 effecting such alterations in  the  law as  might  be desirable  for purposes of simplification, and clarification, followed by a Bill con- consolidating without amendment the law as so altered.  The minute scrutiny of the Public Health law which our present inquiry has entailed has forced us to the conclusion that in this case also the necessary amending Bill would contain so large a mass of detailed amendments that it would be little shorter, and far less intelligible, than the draft amending and consolidating Bill which we have prepared.   As is generally known, the Public Health Acts of 1890, 1907 and 1925,  which comprise in all 234  sections,  are derived  from,  and based on, local Act clauses.   Their diversity of origin shows itself unmistakably in discrepancies of  language not only between the cliiferent Acts but between different sections of  the same  Act.  It is perhaps less generally realised that the great Public Health Act of 1875 is itself  a consolidation of a large number of different and overlapping Acts, the chief  being  .the  Public Health Acts of 1848 and 1872, the Sanitary Act,  1866, the Nuisances Removal Act, 1855, and the Local Government Act, 1858.  Moreover,  the parent Act of  1848 was  largely  based  on clauses which had become more or  less stereotyped in local  Acts  in  the  early  part of the nineteenth  century.   Thus, to cite a  single example  which is mentioned  in  more  detail  in the note which appears later  on Clause 280 of  the Bill,  the  Act of 1875, as a result  of the com- bination of  the various sources from which it was derived,  contains four separate powers of entry, the language of each differing from that of the others.  A Bill limited to pure consolidation would have to reproduce each of these powers in extenso. Many other examples could be given. Hence, while the situation which presented itself in the drafting of the Local Government Bill, namely, that each type of local authority was regulated by a different code, does  not obtain here, the complete lack of uniformity in the language of the Public Health Acts would confront the framer  of  a purely consolidating measure with  even   greater difficulties than he  would have  ex- ineperienced in dealing with  the law relating to local  government where each  of the principal Acts  of 1882, 1888 and 1894  shows the impress of a single draftsman.                         Adoptive  Acts.  7. Many  of  the provisions of the Public Health Acts operate only after they have  been  &quot; adopted &quot; by a local  authority or  put into force by an order of a central authority, and the procedure for bringing the various provisions into force differs widely in different Acts.  Thus the Infectious Disease (Prevention) Act, 1890, provides that a local authority may adopt  all or  any of the sections of that Act by a resolution passed at a meeting of the authority.  Fourteen cleardays&apos; notice of the  meeting and of the  intention to  propose  the resolution must be  given  to  every  member of the authority.  The
resolution must be published in  a  local newspaper,  by handbills,and  otherwise in such manner as the authority  think fit, and does,not come into operation until at least one month after the first pub-lication of the advertisement.  Thus the Act may be adopted as awhole, or individual sections may be adopted.  The whole Act hasbeen adopted by the  councils of 219 boroughs, 516 urban districts and  361 rural districts.  In  addition, various provisions of the Acthave been adopted by the councils of 36 boroughs, 27 urban districts and  25 rural districts.  8. The Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890, is also an&quot;adoptive&quot; Act.  An  urban authority may  adopt any Part ofthe Act, but they cannot &quot; adopt &quot; anything less than a completePart.    A  rural  authority  may  adopt Part   III  (with  certainexceptions56), but any  section  of the  Act,  whether in  Part IIIor elsewhere, can be put into force in a rural  district, or in anypart of a rural district, by an  order  of the Minister of  Healthunder  Section 5  of the Act.  One calendar month&apos;s notice of themeeting and of the intention to propose  the  resolution to adoptmust be given to every member, the resolution must be advertisedin one or more newspapers, and notice of it affixed  to the principaldoors of every  church and  chapel in &quot;the district  and published in  such other  manner as  the  authority think  fit.   Part  iii of the Act, with which alone the  present Bill is  concerned, hasbeen adopted by the  councils of  306  boroughs and  673  urban districts, while  the councils of 398 rural  districts have adoptedsuch of  its provisions  as  a rural  authority can adopt,  and theremaining sections  have been put in force  in a few rural districts.In addition to the powers  already mentioned, the  Minister has power under Section 25 (5)  of the Local  Government Act, 1894,to invest rural authorities generally with any public health powersof urban authorities;  and in accordance with  a recommendationof the Boyal  Commission on  Local Government  (paragraph 198of their Final Beport,  Cmd.  3436) an  order  under that  section(S.B.  &amp; O. 1931, No.  580)  was issued in  1931 putting into  forcein all rural  areas Sections  20 (1), 23 (1) and (2), 24,- 26 (1)  and27.  Further, Section 19 has been put into force in 19 rural areas by order under the Act of  1890  and  a  number of other sectionsof Part III have been sirnilarty put into force  in particular areas.The number  of  rural  areas in which each section of  Part IIIreproduced  in the Bill is  in operation by virtue of  these  variousprocedures is shown in  Table A  in the  Appendix  to this Beport.  9. The Public Health Acts  Amendment  Act,  1907, proceeded ^on a different principle.  Under this Act the Minister of Health or,in the case of  certain Parts, the Secretary of  State, may, on theapplication  of  a  local  authority,  by  order to be  published in  * These exceptions are, Ss.  20, 22,  23 (1) and (2), 24, 26 (1)  27 and 36and  certain sections not germane to, and therefore not reproduced in, thepresent Bill.                                          ....
such manner as the Minister, or&apos;the Secretary of State  directs,declare any Part or any section of this Act to be in force in  thedistrict of the local authority,  or  where the local  authority&apos; are a rural. district  council in any contributory place within the district of the local authority.   Where a,section is.thus applied in a dis-trict, the application may be made  subject to conditions and adapta-tions.   Table B in the  Appendix to this Beport shows the numberof areas in which the  provisions of this  Act  reproduced in  theBill  have been put  in force.  10. The Public Health Act, 1925, is in part an &quot;  adoptive &quot; Act.An urban authority may adopt all or any of the1 sections contained in parts II, III, IV or V of the Act, except that where the populationof the borough or district is less than 20,000 the adoption of certain provisions cannot take effect without the consent of the Minister ofHealth.  A rural district council may adopt all  or any  of the provi-sions of Parts II, III and IV,  again with  certain exceptions,  andthe Minister  may apply any of those excepted provisionsor  any provision  of Part  V to a rural district  by an  order  made underthe Act of 1875.  One  month&apos;s notice of the meeting and of theintention to propose the resolution must be given to every  memberof the authority and published in the press,  and  the resolutionwhen passed  must  be similarly published.  Further,  certain pro-visions in Part  II  apply to county  councils without  adoption  bythem.                                     .           :  -  Part VI operates where Part  VI of the Act of 1907 is in&apos; operation and may be applied to other  areas by order  of the Minister.  PartsVH  to  IX are  of general application, except  some provisions ofPart VIII which operate in urban areas and  may be applied torural areas by order of the  Minister.   Table C in  the Appendixshows the number of areas in  which the provisions reproduced inthe Bill are at present in force.  11. Two further  codes of  procedure for  adoption differing both from each other and from those mentioned above, are.to be foundin the Infectious Disease (Notification) Act,  1889, and the Notifica-tion of Births Act,  1907, but it is  unnecessary to discuss these indetail as both Acts have been made general by later legislation.  We need not labour further the point that the diversity of methods for bringing into operation the  &quot; adoptive Acts  &quot; referred to above would,  if preserved, immensely complicate  the task of consolida-tion.  It remains to discuss the further  and more important ques-tion whether and to what extent the procedure  of bringing publichealth provisions into operation by adoption or ministerial order is under present conditions right  and necessary.       ,  12. It will be seen that there are two main codes for -&quot;  adoption &quot; :(1) a procedure under which,  apart  from differences  in detail, alocal authority, have  power to adopt an Act, or  a Part of an Act,or a particular section of an  Act, without reference to. the central department,  but only  after complying  with a special procedure
designed to give publicity to the proposal to adopt, and  (2) a pro-cedure under which the decision whether the Act or  enactment isto  come  into  operation, in  any  particular area lies  with  theDepartment.  There is no doubt that both procedures have in the past provedthemselves, and in certain circumstances still are, convenient, legis-lative methods.   To take  an example outside  the Public  Healthcode, if a council wish to take advantage of the enabling provisionsof the Local Government and Other Officers&apos; Superannuation Act,1922, and establish thereunder  a superannuation scheme for their staff, it is clearly right  that a decision  of such importance shouldnot  be  taken by  a  chance  majority of members  attending  an ordinary  meeting of the  council.  Again,  as  regards the powerof the Minister to bring  enactments into operation  by order, itis convenient in  view  of  the  widely  different  circumstances ofdifferent local authorities, and the wide variations in their financial resources and in  the  types of district under  their  control, that parliament  should sometimes  confer  powers  or  impose  obli-gatioms  in  general  terms,  leaving it  to  the  Minister  to decide whether in any particular  case the circumstances require that aparticular authority  should be  entrusted  with  the   discharge ofthe functions in question.  It is also to be remembered that thepublic health code is  largely the outcome  of local experimentssanctioned by Parliament  in  local legislation, and that,  as  already pointed out, much of  the  present general  code  consists of these local Act provisions  re-enacted  in a generalised form.  Thus, asystem  under which the application of the particular  enactmentto any  given locality  is left  to  the discretion  of the Departmentrepresents a natural transition  from the  method still  in activeoperation of Parliament itself conferring by local Act additional powers  required by particular authorities.   13. None the less, when all this is said, our examination of theActs has  led us to the conclusion that the method of  proceeding byway of &apos;&apos;  adoption &apos;&apos; has in the past been overdone.  Not a few casesof patent absurdity can be found, as,  for example,  the fact that section -60  of the  Act  of 1907, which is  in effect a  &quot; removal of-doubts  &quot; clause, and  Section 62 of the same  Act, which  slightlyextends a provision of the Act of 1875,  should require to be put inforce by  order.  Again, there are a number of provisions which atpresent  require  adoption  but  might well  have  been  framed as &quot; enabling &quot;clauses, operating without adoption  if and in so far asthe local  authority think fit to exercise the powers.  A good oxampleof these  may be found in Section 37  of the  Act of 1925, which enables a local authority by agreement with, and  at the expense of,the owner of a house to connect his premises with the sewer.   Thepractical question, however,  is not whether an unnecessary use ofthe procedure of adoption has been made in the  past, but  how fa&apos;it is: necessary to retain it  in preparing the present Bill.
  14. We have examined the figures set out in the Tables in theAppendix from this point of view.  These figures  show that allthe provisions in question are in fact, in force over very wide areas.Moreover it is to be noted that, as already indicated, nearly allthese provisions were included in the general law  after becomingcommon in local legislation. Accordingly, the figures in the Tablesby no means  represent the whole  number of areas in  which anyparticular provision is in force, since they do not include those inwhich an identical, or closely similar, provision, operates by virtue ofa local Act.  A further  consideration, though not of great import-ance, is worthy of mention.  We understand that  in the case of anumber of provisions which require to be  put into- operation byorder, the Department are so satisfied that the provision might reasonably form part of the general law that an order is made as amatter of course  upon the application of any local authority.  Sofar as this is the case,  the preparation,  issue and publication of  a formal order bringing the provision into operation  are  a  waste oftime and energy.  These considerations have led us to the conclusion that  the  time has now arrived when,  with certain exceptions, the adoptive pro-visions of the Acts of  1890, 1907 and  1925  (so far as  those  Actsare  reproduced in  the  Bill) and also of the  Infectious  Disease(Prevention) Act, 1890, may properly be made of  general applica-tion.  The draft Bill has been framed  accordingly, and the result is a very substantial simplification of the Public Health law.   the few exceptions, which are collected in the note on Clause 13 of theBill, represent provisions which are still appropriate only to areasof an urban character.   Under that clause,  which takes the placeof Section 276 of the Act of 1875 and corresponding provisions ofthe  later Acts, the  Minister can  invest individual rural authorities with urban powers.                   Regulation-making Powers.  15. In our first Interim Report  we pointed out  (paragraph 12)that  the whole subject  of regulation-making powers had  been re-oently  examined  by the  Departmental  Committee  on  Ministers&apos;Powers  (Report Cmd.  4060/1932)  and that for that  reason we thought  it  better  to  reproduce substantially  &apos;the  existing  law.When  the Local G-overnment Bill was before the Joint  SelectCommittee,  the  Committee, after considering certain  suggestions made to them on behalf of the Minister of Health, decided upona course of action which may be summarised as follows :       (1) that it  is unnecessary  to  burden Parliament with regu-    lations concerned with  details of  administration, and accord-    ingly that the requirement to lay regulations before Parliament    should only be imposed in  the caise  of those of  substantial    importance and of a legislative character;      (2) that all regulations which were required to be  laid before    Parliament should  be liable  to annulment by the ordinary
  .R  procedure of .an. Address by, either House  and that a uniform     period^SO days-should be provided  for  this action.  Effect     was given^ to this decision in Section 299 of the Local Govern-     ment Aet,:19.33;   .              .       (3)&apos; that1 the validity of all regulations, except the regulations     which deal with the issue  of stock and to which special con-     si derations apply, should be liable  to challenge in the Courts     in the&apos;ordinary manner, and that any provisions of the existing     law making regulations &quot; have effect as if enacted in the Act &quot;     should be omitted.  The number of regulation-making powers in the present Bill  is comparatively  small.  The  powers  will be  found in  Clauses 104,126, 143, 161,  179,  180, 204,  250 and 277 (2) of the Bill, andin paragraph 1 of the First Schedule.    In  drafting these pro-visions we have followed the principles adopted  by the Joint SelectCommittee.-     The  regulation-making powers  under Clause 143(prevention  and treatment of infectious diseases) are so wide andthe subject  matter of such  importance that we have inserted  aprovision requiring  them to be laid before Parliament, though this represents new law.  We have done the same as regards the regula-tions under  the  First Schedule prescribing the qualifications  of medical officers. of  port  health districts.   This also  is new, butit follows the action taken by Parliament on the Local government act, 1933,  where  for the  first  time regulations prescribing the qualifications of medical officers  of health of boroughs  and of urban and rural districts,  were  required to be laid before Parliament (see section 108  (5) ).  Clause 311, which  provides  for  the laying  before  parliament and  annulment of regulations, follows the  lines of Section 299  ofthe Act of 1933.  16. As regards publication, the effect of Section 1  of the RulesPublication  Act, 1893, is to make  it necessary to publish in theLondon Gazette: notice  of  an  intention to make  any&apos;regulationwhich is required to be laid before Parliament and to  put copies ofthe  regulation  on  sale. -   We  have  treated  this  procedure  asa  satisfactory&apos; substitute  for the requirement  in Section 130  ofthe Act of 1875 &apos;(Clause&apos;143 of  the  Bill) that the regulations mustbe printed in extenso in  the London Gazette an expensive pro-cedure which is now out of  date and also for  the requirement  inSection 9 of the Canal Boats Act, 1877, which required the Depart-ment to prescribe places in&apos; the neighbourhood of canals,, and theprice, at which regulations might be purchased.  None&apos;of the  regulation-making  powets  reproduced in the bill provides for the regulations having  effect as if enacted in the Act,or otherwise purports  to make  the&apos; validity of  the regulations xm-challengeable;  at will be seen;: moreover, from paragraph: 133  ofthis Report  that -we recommend the repeal without re-enactment  of
Section 295  of  the Act of 18.75, which .makes, the orders of theMinister  of  Health  &quot; binding and  conclusive  in respect of thematters to which they refer.&apos;-                           Penalties.  17. The enactments  dealing with  penalties for non-compliance,which are reproduced in the Bill, show much diversity with regardto the maximum fines which  may be imposed.   This  is  to  someextent necessary, for obviously some  offences, e.g..that of  erectinga house without a drain,  for  which  a maximum penalty of fiftypounds is fixed by the Act of 1875, are of a more  serious character and   call  for  a  stronger deterrent  than  the  minor   offenceswith  which the  Acts deal.  On the other.hand, it is clear that asregards  these minor offences, Parliament has not adhered strictlyto any definite policy and that, while a  maximum penalty of fivepounds, with a  daily penalty of forty shillings in  the case of con-tinuing offences, may be taken to represent the normal, there are many departures  from  these  figures for  which  no good reasoncould be  assigned  and  which  probably  have their  origin in thedifferent language of different local Acts.   Thus,  under Section 16of the Infectious Disease  (Prevention)&apos; Act, 1890, the maximumpenalties are five pounds and  forty shillings.  Under Part IV ofthe Act of 1907 a Part dealing with the same  subject matter a maximum penalty of five pounds is  to be found in Sections 53, 61and 64, but in the remaining sections  the  maximum penalty is  fortyshillings.  Again, Section 36 of the Act of 1907, which makes  it an offence to use rain  water  pipes  as soil  pipes, imposes maximumpenalties of five pounds and forty shillings, whereas Section 37,which forbids water pipes being used to serve as ventilating shaftsto drains, provides maximum penalties  of  forty  shillings andtwenty shillings.  Throughout the  Bill  we have  inserted  five pounds and  fortyshillings as the maximum penalty for a first offence and for a con-tinuing  offence in all  cases except those which clearly called forspecial treatment, and we have thought it unnecessary to call atten-tioti in the notes on clauses to  cases where  this policy.has involved an amendment of the existing law either by way of increase or de-crease.  In cases where the Bill effects  any amendment  of  more substantial penalties, attention is drawn  to the point in the  note on the clause in question.                           Appeals.  18.  The provisions of the Public  Health  Acts  with regard  toappeals from decisions of local authorities are exceedingly  difficultto interpret.  The Act of 1875 contains no general right of.appeal against orders or requirements of local authorities,  but:Section 268of the Act enables a person who is  aggrieved by a decision  of  alocal  authority  &quot; in any  case in  which the local  -authority are
empowered to recover in a summary manner any expenses incurred by them or to declare such expenses  to be private improvementexpenses &quot; to appeal to the Minister of Health.  The  Act of 1890on the other hand provides (Section 7)  for  an appeal to quarter sessions by any person aggrieved :       &quot;  (a) By any order, judgment, determination or  requirement    of a local  authority under this Act;      (b) By the withholding  of any order,  certificate,  licence,    consent,  or approval which  may be made, granted or given by    a local authority under this Act.&quot;  Sub-section  (2)  provides that  the section  &quot; shall mot  apply  incases  where  there is an  appeal  to the Local  Government Board(now  the Minister)  under Section 268 of the Public Health  Act,1875.&quot;   It was held in  R. v. Essex Justices,  [1916]  2 Z.B. 406that an  appeal lies to quarter  sessions  against a  refusal on thepart of  a  local  authority acting  under  Section  169  of  theAct of  1875 to grant  a knacker&apos;s  licence,  the  decision being based on the  ground  that the  Act of  1890 is to be  construed as one with the earlier Act.  It may be doubted whether this wasthe intention of the  draftsman.   To apply Section  7 to every &quot; re-requirement &quot;  under  the  Act of  1875  produces results  which can hardly have  been  contemplated  by Parliament.   For example,under Section 83 of that Act the keeper of a common lodging-househas a duty &apos;&apos; if required in writing by the local authority &apos;&apos; to reportto the authority persons resorting to the house during the precedingday  or  night.  It  is  very unlikely that  Parliament  desired  toburden quarter sessions with appeals on matters of this kind.  The terms of Section 7  of the Act of 1907 are substantially thesame as those of Section 7 of the Act of 1890; and Section  7 of theAct of 1925 incorporates, inter alia, Section 7 of the Act of 1907.The position appears to be, therefore, that apart from sections which make some  specific provision  for other forms  of appeal.  (e.g.,Section 42 of the  Act  of 1907,  which  provides for  an  appeal  to acourt of summary  jurisdiction) there is  a general right  of appeal  toquarter sessions  under  the Acts  of  1890,  1907  and 1925,  andprobably under the Act of 1875, except where an appeal hes to theMinister under Section 268 of the Act of 1875.  The exact limits ofthe Minister&apos;s jurisdiction under Section 268 have, as is  well known,been the subject of much litigation.  The point need not, however,be discussed here,  for if the recommendation  which we make  inparagraphs 61-63 below are accepted,  the  existing procedure willbe replaced by an appeal to a court of  summary jurisdiction (or  inone instance to the Minister) wherever  the case is one in which thelocal authority require the owner to incur expense in executingworks or otherwise remedying a condition of things which is objee-tionable from the point of view of  public health.  Provision is made-for this in Clause 283 of the Bill.
1919   This type of requirement forms the most numerous and importantclass under the  Bill.   As regards the remainder, we feel no doubtthat it would be  a mistake to insert any  general  clause giving aright of  appeal, whether to quarter  sessions,  courts of  summary jurisdiction or the Minister,  against  orders, requirements,  deter-determinations,  etc.,  of  a local  authority.  The  fact  that  the  Billreproduces a number of Acts which do not form part of the publichealth code and to which therefore the various appeal sections towhich we have  drawn attention above do not apply would in itselfpresent a  serious obstacle  to  this  course.  A more fundamentalobjection lies in the fact that not every decision of a local authority should be  subject to  appeal, and  that it is quite impracticable bythe use of general words such as &quot; orders, judgments, determinationsor requirements  &apos;&apos;  to distinguish between those from which an appeal should lie  and those  from which it  should not.  Thus, to take asingle example, Section 36 of  the Act of 1890 provides that everybuilding used as a place of public resort is  to be substantially con-structed  and provided with  means  of  ingress  and  egress &quot;tothe satisfaction  of the urban authority.&quot;   If the section  had beendifferently  drafted and had obliged the  owner to comply with the&quot;  requirements  &quot;  of the authority as regards ingress and  egress anappeal to  quarter  sessions would clearly have lain under  Section 7of the Act; as the language stands, it is doubtful whether an appeallies or not.   A perusal of the Acts of 1875, 1890 and 1907 disclosesmany instances  of  the same ambiguity.   We have  accordinglyadopted the principle  of inserting  a right of appeal either  ex-pressly or  by a definite reference to  Clause 283 in every  clausewhere, in  our opinion, it should  be  given.   With regard to the proper appellate  tribunal, we have adopted the view that, in general, the appeal  should lie in the first instance to a court of summary jurisdiction.   Provision is made in Clause293 of the Bill for a  further appeal&apos;to a court of quarter sessions.                  Power to break open streets.   19. The  question  on what conditions  a light  to  break openstreets should be  exercised arises on three Parts  of the Bill inconnection with drains and sewers (Part II), water pipes (Part IV)and  pipes  for  the   supply   of  public baths  and  washhouses(Part VIII).   Under the existing law, a local authority who propose to executeworks of sewerage outside their district must give notice of their proposals  in  a local newspaper and  serve  copies of the notice  onthe owners,  lessees and occupiers of lands affected,  on the townclerk or  clerk  of the urban district  council  if  the  proposedworks will be in an urban area, or upon the chairman of the parishcouneil or  parish  meeting in  a rural  parish, and on the highway authority  or  other persons having the care of the streets affected.If objection is taken and sustained, the works cannot be commenced
without the consent  of  the  Minister, who may make  such modi-fications in the proposals as he thinks necessary.  For works within their  district the local authority are subject  to no such control.  For the  laying of water mains within or without their district,local  authorities are, by Section 54 of the Act of 1875, given thesame  powers and made  subject to the same  restrictions,  as in thecase of the laying  of  sewers, but this must be read together with section 57 of the  same Act which incorporates certain provisionsof the  Waterworks Clauses  Acts,  the  most important  of whichin this  connection  are Sections 28 to  34 of the Act of 1847.  Sec-tion 28 confers a  power to  break up a street under the superin-tendence  of  the   persons having its   control or management.Section 29 prohibits the  breaking up of land not dedicated to publicuse except  with the  consent of the owners or  occupiers.  this last-mentioned section has in effect been superseded by Section 80of the Act of  1925, which provides that if a  local  authority supplygas or water,  they  may  lay down pipes in  streets  not dedicated to public use  for the  purpose of  supplying  premises  in those streets.Section 30 of the Waterworks  Clauses Act, 1847, requires the localauthority  to give  three  days&apos; notice  of intention to  break  up astreet,  and Section 31  requires the work to be  done under thesuperintendence of  the persons having the  control or management of the street and according to a plan  approved by them or, in theevent of dispute, by two Justices.  Sections 32 to 34  provide forreinstatement.  But in incorporating these sections of the Act of  1847, Section 57of the Act of 1875 adds the words &quot; where the local authority havenot the control of the streets &quot;.  It was held in Hill v.  WallaseyLocal Board [1894] 1 Ch. 133 that these words referred to a localauthority who have not the  control of  streets  generally  in  their district, i.e. who are  not a highway authority.    From  1894 to1929, therefore, this  incorporation was of little  importance, for both urban and rural district councils  were highway  authorities.Since the changes  made by  the Local  Government Act,  1929, ithas again operated to secure that  a rural district  council shall inlaying down water  mains be subject to the superintendence of thecounty council as highway authority.  The provision in the Bill  (Clause 227) empowering local authoritiesto break up streets  for the purpose of  laying pipes  to supply publicbaths and  washhouses is  taken from  local  Acts.   These provide that the local  authority can for the purpose break  up  any highwayrepairable by them, and  break up any  other highway with the con-sent of the authority or persons liable for its repair.  There seems no good reason why in this respect  the constructionof sewers,  the laying of water mains, and  the laying of  pipes for supplying public baths should not be on the  same footing.  More-over,  the  question  whether  the superintendence  and control forwhich the  incorporated  sections provide  should be imposed ought
clearly to depend  on whether the authority  executing  the works are the highway authority for the street in question and not whetherthey have  or  have not  any highway functions in general.   TheBill proceeds on this footing :  see  Clause  276.  The further requirements in the case of works outside the districtare dealt with in the note on Clause 16.  20.  The  power  of  owners and occupiers  of  premises to breakup streets also needs consideration.  Section  52  of the WaterworksClauses Act,  1847,  confers  such a power  for the initial laying  ofthe pipe, subject  to the same  control and obligations as  apply  to water  undertakers.   Local Acts commonly extend this  power forpurposes  of examination and maintenance  and repair of  pipes, andthe Bill follows these precedents (Clause 121).   There is, however,no general power at any rate no express power -to break up streetsfor the purposes of connecting drains to sewers, though  Section 37of the Act  of 1925  empowers  a local authority  to do the  work onbehalf of the owner or  occupier by agreement in a private street.The Bill  makes good the omission by conferring a general powersubject to the same conditions as apply in connection with watercommunication pipes  (Clause 34 (2)).              Savings  for Statutory Undertakers.  21.  The  provisions of the Public Health  Acts  with  regard to statutory  undertakers  present some difficulty.  Sections 327 to 333of the Act of 1875 contain elaborate savings for canal,  dock, har-bour  and river  authorities  and  for  Commissioners of  Sewers.Further,  section 157  of that Act  exempts from building  byelawsbuildings  belonging to railway  companies and  used for the pur-poses of the railway and Section  33 of  the  Act of 1907  exemptsfrom certain provisions  of the Act and from byelaws made underthem buildings (other than dwelling-houses)  belonging  to a rail-way company  or harbour,  pier, dock, caiial or inland  navigationauthority  and used in connection with the undertaking.   additional savings for railway  companies  and other undertakers  are to befound in the following sections of other Acts reproduced in the Bill-Section 20  (4) of  the  Act of 1890 and Sections 11 and 39 (5) ofthe Act of  1925.  22. There are obvious advantages in shortening and simphfyingthe language of sections 327 to 333 and bringing the later savingsinto relation with these sections.  In particular,  it would be useful to make plain throughout any saving clauses that may be inserted,a distinction which has been drawn .in the case law between theproperty of statutory undertakers used for the primary purposesi the  undertaking, and  other property (e.g., workmen&apos;s  dwellings)ivhich  Parliament has, with increasing frequency,.enabled statutorymdertakers to acquire for ancillary purposes.  We came to the con-fusion, however,  that before this detailed work of  drafting was
attempted it would be desirable to consult the bodies -representingthe undertakers concerned on the general principles to- be adopted,and that any negotiations could best be conducted by the Ministryof Health after the publication of the draft Bill.  23. We have accordingly reproduced the present savings substan-tially as they stand and have indicated by square brackets that theycall for further consideration.                            PART I.                 LOCAL  ADMINISTRATION.                Committees of Local Authorities.  24. The position with regard to committees of local  authoritieswas  discussed in paragraphs 60 to 64 of our first Interim Report.In relation  to  public health we have found  it necessary to con-sider three special statutory committees, namely, the public health and housing committee of a county council, the tuberculosis corn-mittee of a county or county borough council,  and the maternity and child welfare committee of a county council, borough or districtcouncil.       The  existing law  with regard to these committees  is asfollows :        Public Health and Housing Committee. Section 71 of the    Housing,  Town Planning,  etc., Act,  1909, requires  every    county  council to  appoint  this committee.   Matters  relating    to the discharge by the council of public health and housing    functions  (except  the  powers  of precepting and   borrowing)    stand referred  to the  committee, and before discharging any    such functions the council  must  consider  the  committee&apos;s    report thereon,  unless the matter is urgent. Further, the council    may, if they wish, delegate to the  committee their public health    and  housing functions,  other  than  powers of precepting and    borrowing  and  of resolving to declare district  councils to  be in     default, and may  impose  restrictions  or conditions on such     delegation.   Under Section  14 (3)  of the Local Government    Act, 1929, persons  who are not members of the council may be    appointed to the committee, but these persons must  not EXCEED    one-third of the whole number.   The committee may appoint     sub-committees,  and  may include  on  these sub-committees     persons who are not members of the committee.       It is to be observed that neither the Act of 1875,  nor any of     the  succeeding Public Health Acts, placed any corresponding     obligation  on sanitary authorities to appoint a  public health     committee, though we believe that such a committee is almost     invariably appointed.   The difference in this respect between     county councils and other authorities is  no doubt accounted for
   partly by the difference in date between the governing statutes,   and partly by the fact that  county councils usually meet less   frequently than borough or  district councils.      Tuberculosis Committee. By Section 4 of the Public Health    (Tuberculosis) Act, 1921, councils exercising powers under the   Act, i.e., county and county borough councils, are empowered,   but not required, to exercise their powers (other than  levying,   or precepting for, a rate, or borrowing) through a committee or   a sub-committee.  Power is given to the council and, subject to   any directions  of the  council, to the  committee  to  appoint   persons who are not members of the council to be members of   the committee br sub-committee up to a limit of one-third of the   total membership, and these persons must be &quot; persons (includ-   ing members of insurance committees)  ....  specially  quali-   fied by training or experience in matters relating to the treat-   ment of tuberculosis &quot;.      Maternity and Child Welfare  Committee. By Section 2 of   the Maternity  and  Child Welfare Act,  1918,  every council   exercising powers under the Act is required to appoint a mater -   nity and child welfare committee, but the committee may be a   committee appointed for other purposes or a sub-committee of   such a committee.   In other respects the section is practically   identical with Section 71 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc.,   Act, 1909, already referred to, but  it provides that at least two   members of the  committee must be women, and that, if persons   who are not members of the authority are appointed as members   of the committee, they must be persons specially qualified  by   training  or  experience in  subjects  relating  to health  and   maternity.  25. It will be noted that the appointment of a Public  Health and housing Committee extends only to county councils but is compul-sory, that the appointment of a Tuberculosis Committee is optional,and that  the  Maternity and Child Welfare Committee occupies a half-way  position, since though every council operating the  Act isrequired to appoint  one, it may use  for the purpose some existingcommittee or sub-committee.   There is little doubt that one  of theprincipal  objects of  these provisions  was to give authorities  powerto appoint as  members of the  committees persons who were not members of  the council.  The  position of committees other thanspecial statutory committees is now fully  covered by  Section 85 ofthe Local  Government  Act,  1933, under  which every  type of authority has a general power to appoint committees and  to placeon them persons who are not members of the  local authority up to a limit of one-third of the total membership.  Further, in the case of the three committees in question there ispower to appoint persons  who are not members of the committee
as members of a sub-committee.  In preparing the Local Govern -ment Bill we  considered whether this power to appoint outsidepersons  to  sub-committees  should be conferred  generally, and reached  the conclusion that if there  is  a power to appoint out-side persons to the committee  itself, the further power in the caseof sub-committees is not one of substantial value.  26.. The appointment of a Public Health and Housing Committeeis obligatory, but the obligation applies only to county councils andnot to local authorities in general, and  we consider that a repeal ofthe provision without re-enactment would simplify and  assimilatethe. law. without throwing away anything of value.   No countycouncil is likely to attempt to discharge its public health or hous-ing functions without the assistance of a committee, and it has&apos; beensuggested to. us that a combination of public health and housing inthe hands of a single committee is not necessarily the most conven-ient course.   It may well be thought that  a somewhat differentgrouping of functions might prove more satisfactory, and  we under-stand that at least  one county council has  obtained power from parliament to vary the requirements of the Act of 1909 with regardto the Public Health and Housing Committee.  27. In  the case of the Tuberculosis Committee  the. only  effectof the repeal without re-enactment of  Section 4 of the Act of 1921would be to remove the power of appointing outside persons on sub-committees and the requirement that the appointing authority mustsee that  the  outside persons appointed on the full committee  are specially qualified to deal with the subject matter in question.  Asregards  the latter requirement, we think  that it may properly  beassumed that if a local authority decide to  appoint outside membersthey will without any express direction on the point select personswho are  qualified for the position.  The reference in the  section to members of Insurance Committees is in any case obsolete, havingbeen included at a time when Insurance Committees administeredsanatorium benefit under the  National Plealth Insurance Acts,  a benefit which was discontinued in 1920.  We are satisfied that  thesection may properly be repealed without  re-enactment.  28. We have felt  some doubt with regard to the Maternity and child Welfare Committee.  It is difficult to suppose that, after  theexperience which has now been gained, any authority would attemptto carry  on the service without the  assistance of a committee which included women  and other persons having special  knowledge and experience; and for that reason we doubt whether the repeal of thesection would make  any practical  difference.   On the other hand,the establishment of such a committee  is not  merely optional, and,having regard to this fact and  to the fact that the Act of 1918 is a relatively recent statute, we have reproduced Section 2 of.the Mater -nity and Child Welfare Act,.1918, in. Clause 201 of the draft Bill.
              Joint Committees and J.oint Boards.  29. The  position with regard to-Joint  Committees and  joint boards  for public health purposes  under  the  existing law. is  asfollows :       (1) Under Section.279 of the Act of 1875, the Minister has    power  by provisional order to unite districts for any  purpose    of the Act and to constitute-a joint board.     ....      : (2)&apos; Under&apos; Section 287. of the same Act as amended  by ,Sec-    tion 3 of the Act of 1885 the Minister  has power to. constitute    one of more. local authorities or port conservators or commis-    sioners  a port sanitary  authority. by. an order  which is pro-    visional only if opposed.      (3) Section  5 of the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Act,  1921,    enables the Minister by  order  to. constitute joint committees    of county councils and county borough councils for any of the    purposes of the Act.         -   -     &apos;      (4) Under Section 91 of the  Local Government Act,  1933,    any  local authority  (including a county council and a parish    council)  may concur with any other local authority in appoint-    ing  a joint committee for any purposes in which they are jointly    interested.      (5) Under  Section 112 of the  same Act the Minister has    power by order to unite districts for the purpose of appointing    a medical officer of  health.  30.  The provisions of  the Act of 1875 as amended in 1885  withregard to port sanitary authorities and united districts are substan-tially  reproduced in Clauses  2-7, 9 and 10 of the  Bill. Throughoutthe  Bill the  term  &quot; port health  authority &quot; has been substitutedfor &apos;&apos; port sanitary authority &apos;&apos;.  This change has been suggested tous by the Association of Port Sanitary Authorities.  We agree withthe  Association that the  new name gives a  better indication of theactivities of these bodies.  At the request of the Port  Sanitary Authority for the  Port  ofLondon  the change of name has been made to extend to that body.  It will be  observed  that . Clause 6  enables the Minister  insetting up a  joint board to include representatives of the countycouncil.   This is new law,  but it appears to us  to follow naturallyfrom the power  conferred on county councils by Section 57 of theLocal Government Act,  1929, to contribute towards the expensesof district councils for public health purposes,  and  also from thefact  that the same  Act gave county councils   power themselvesto provide hospital accommodation.  We  considered whether thepower to include county council  representatives  should be  limited in terms&apos;to  the case of  a joint hospital  board or a board towardsthe&apos; expenses1 of  which  the coiinty council had undertaken to makecontributions, but  we came  to the conclusion that it was unneces-sary to&apos;impose this express limitation, since it is  highly improbable
that an order  including  county council representatives would bemade except  on the  footing that the  county council bore  someshare of the financial  burden.  The  notes on Clauses  6 and 9 call attention to matters of detail in which they depart from the existing law.  31. As  regards  combinations  of  county  councils  and  countyborough councils,  our  attention  has  been  called to Section  3of the Poor Law Act, 1930, Section 29 of  the Mental DeficiencyAct,  1913,  and  Section 5  of  the Public Health  (Tuberculosis)Act, 1921.  All these  provisions enable  the Minister to effect com-binations  for the purposes of the respective Acts,  and there seemsto  be  no reason why in the region of public health the  power should  be limited  to  the treatment of tuberculosis.    We have accordingly  provided in Clause 8 of the  Bill that, with the consentof the councils concerned, the Minister may  constitute joint com-mittees for  any  of the purposes of  the Bill.  As  in  the existing legislation,  the power extends  to combinations, either of countycouncils with  county borough councils,  or of  county councils withcounty councils, or of county borough councils with county borough councils.  It is true that any of these bodies can combine underSection 91  of the Local Government Act,  1933, in appointing a joint committee, but committees  appointed under  that sectionare not corporate bodies, and experience has shown  that, while theyare valuable for certain limited purposes, they are not appropriatebodies for discharging more important and  permanent  functionsinvolving the  acquisition and  holding of  land,  the making of contracts, and  borrowing.                           PART II.             SANITATION  AND   BUILDINGS.              Vesting of seioers in local authorities.  32. The difficulties connected with the vesting of sewers in localauthorities are notorious. Stated as briefly as possible, the position under the existing law is as follows :   The Act of 1875 distinguishes between  drains and sewers, definition-ing a drain as  a drain used for  the drainage of one building only and made for communicating with&apos; a cesspool or sewer, and a seweras including any other kind of drain.  The Act, following the PublicHealth Act, 1848, then proceeds to enact that all existing and futuresewers, with certain exceptions referred to below, aie to vest in thelocal authority.   It  is common knowledge that the Act has never been regarded as imposing an obligation on local authorities to sewertheir districts in advance of development, and as a consequence the almost universal practice has been for a developer to construct the
sewers necessary for the drainage of the buildings which he is erect-ing.   The  responsibility for maintaining these sewers after theircompletion passes automatically to the local  authority, and it  hasthus been  a matter of financial concern  to the authority whethera particular pipe is technically a sewer or a drain, since in the firstcase  but not in the second the burden of maintenance falls  on theauthority.  Recourse  has been  had to various devices to preventdevelopers  throwing on the ratepayers as a whole the cost of main-taining  pipes which, though technically sewers for the reason thatthey drain  more than one building, are of the character  of privatedrains.  In some  cases,  local authorities have insisted upon each house being served by a separate drain in circumstances where asingle drain serving two or more houses would meet all sanitaryrequirements,  and  have  thereby thrown unnecessary expense  onowners.  More commonly,  the  practice of requiring  an owner to execute an agreement making himself and his successors in titleresponsible for the maintenance of the pipes,  notwithstanding thatthey  technically form a sewer, has been adopted, though the effectof some of these  agreements is not free from doubt.  In many areas  attempts have  been  made  to  meet  the situation by local legislation.  33.  A clause which had frequently appeared in local  Acts was finally introduced into the general law as an &quot; adoptive &quot; provision and now appears as Section 19 of the Act of 1890.   This section pro-vides that where &quot; two or more houses belonging to different ownersare connected with a public sewer by a single private  drain  &quot;  Sec-tion 41 of the Act  of 1875 (which enables a local authority to make good a defective drain at the expense of the owner) is to apply and theauthority are to be entitled to recover their expenses in suitable pro-portions from the owners concerned. Disputes  arising on this section and on the definition of drains and sewers in  the Act  of 1875 havegiven rise to a large number of judicial decisions which need  not bereferred to in  detail.  They are, in the language of Scrutton L. J. inHill  v.  Aldershot Corporation,  [1933]  1 K.B.  259, at p. 267,&quot; chaotic and contradictory  &quot;.   The leading cases are  the decisionof the House of Lords in Wood Green U.D.C. v. Joseph,  [1908]A.C. 419, and of the Court of Appeal in the Aldershot case already referred to.  It appears from these decisions that Section 19 is defect-tive in  at least two respects (1) because it is limited to  drainsfrom houses  &quot; belonging to different owners &quot;,  and  (2) becauseunder the judgment of the House of Lords in the Wood Green case,as interpreted by Lawrence and  Greer L.JJ. in the Aldershot case,the section applies only if the authority can establish that the com-bined drain was originally constructed by reason of a requirement ofthe local authority made under Section 23 or 25 of the Act of 1875.  34.  Attempts have been  made in subsequent local legislation toimprove upon Section 19, for instance, by providing for  combineddrainage orders.    In  some  cases   Section  41  of   the Act   of1875 has been  applied in  terms to  a drain  serving two or more
houses whether owned by the same person  or  not,  and  in  oneinstance the words  &quot; whether such drain was originally constructedin pursuance of a requirement of the Corporation  or their predeces-sors  or not &quot;  have been  inserted in order to negative  the  viewadopted by the House of Lords in the Wood Green case..  35. To deal satisfactorily with the problems to which this legis-lation  has  given rise involves going far beyond consolidation, butin view of the fact that our Terms of Reference include the making of recommendations for simplifying  and clarifying the law, we feel it  impossible  to reproduce without  amendment  provisions whichhave provoked  a large amount of litigation  and have called forth the strongest judicial condemnation.   &quot;I cannot avoid pointing out &quot;,said  Lord  Russell  C.J. in  Bradford v..  Eastbourne Corporation,[1896] 2 Q.B.  at p. 213, a case  turning on Section 19 of the Act of1890,  &quot; the highly  unsatisfactorj- state of the existing  legislation relating, to the question of public health,  and to  cognate questionsof local authority under the Acts dealing  with that  subject.  It is entirely unsystematic and most  confused, and in the public intereststeps ought to be  speedily taken  to reduce the existing  chaos intosystem and order.&quot;  Nearly 40 years later Scrutton L.J.,. in.theAldershot case already referred  to, used even stronger language inconnection with Section 19 which he described as &quot; a  disgrace toEnglish legislation.&quot;  36. Two methods of amending the law presented themselves tous.  The first was to adopt and, if possible, improve on  the  various local Act provisions amending Section 19  of the Act of  1890.  Thesecond was to recommend  the more  radical step of abandoning alto-gether the  principle that pipes which drain more  than one buildings should of necessity vest in  the local authority.  In considering these alternatives, it was brought to our notice that when the Bill which became the Public Health Act, 1925, was before the House of Lordsan amendment designed to remedy the defects of  Section  19 on thelines usually adopted in local Acts w7as moved  but was  resisted bythe Government on the ground that it. was proposed to  introduce legislation  dealing  with   the  matter  &quot;  on more comprehensivelines &quot;.  We  understand that at  the time the  Ministry of  Healthwere considering a Public Health  Bill which, amongst other things,proposed to abolish the automatic  &quot; vesting &quot; of sewers in-localauthorities, but that the Bill had subsequently to give  way to themore urgent matters dealt with in  the Local Government Act,. 1929.Moreover,  it is well known that proposals on these lines had long been the subject  of discussion.   So long  ago as. 1903 Mr.  WalterLong, as President of the Local  Government Board, publicly ex-pressed the view that a sewer ought  not to vest  in a. local authority,unless it had been approved by them in every detail.  37.&apos; Apart, however, from these considerations  we feel clear thattinkering with  the language of Section 19  will provide no  real solu-tion  of the problem, and that the time has arrived for abandoning
2-4-the principle, which experience has shown.to.be unsound, that theresponsibility for maintaining a particular pipe should depend solely on  the question whether the pipe  serves one  or more than  onebuilding:  Moreover, we are satisfied that it is not practicable to lay down a hard and fast line in an Act of Parliament, and to throwthe responsibility for maintenance on the ratepayers as a whole, orto leave it. with in dividual--developers or owners, according as thepipe in question falls on one side of  that  line or the other. :  In ourview the circumstances vary within  such wide-limits that Parlia-ment cannot  hope  to do  more  than leave to  some  competent authority the duty of deciding whether or not in a particular casethe responsibility for maintenance should  be transferred to the  localauthority and indicate in the Act the kind of considerations to which that authority ought to have regard in arriving at a decision.  38.  Accordingly  the draft Bill repeals  Section  13 of  the Act of1875 and  as regards future sewers  substitutes  the procedure setout in Clause  17.   The  salient. points  of  this procedure  are asFOLLOWS : , .                         -      (1)  Tire  distinction between a drain, that, is, a pipe serving    one building only, and a sewer is maintained : see the definitions    of these  terms in Clause 332. .   We considered  the question    whether  it would be  convenient to alter the terminology  and    limit  the  word  &quot;sewer&quot;   to  a  sewer vested in the  local    authority.  This course has some advantages,  but we came to    the conclusion that it would involve too great a departure from    the ordinary meaning and use of the word  &quot;drain  &quot; if it was    used to cover lines of pipes laid  under streets and serving large    numbers of houses.   Accordingly, the term  &apos;&quot; public  sewer &quot;    is used to denote a sewer vested in the local authority (Clause    20(2).      (2)  Clause 17  applies only to  sewers completed after  the    commencement of the Bill.  The responsibility for sewers com-    pleted before that date will remain practically unaltered,  that    is to say, it will in general rest with  the local authorities.      (3)  Subsection (1) of the clause empowers a local authority    to declare  any  sewer or sewage disposal works to be vested in    THEM.  1&apos;.    &apos;      - &apos;-.    -      ...  - - \: -      (4)  Subsection (2) enables the owner of a sewer or sewage    disposal works  to apply for a declaration vesting it in the  local    authority.      (5)  If  the authority  do not  accede to  the application,. an    appeal lies to the Minister.      (6)  Considerations which should be present to the minds of    the local authority and the Minister are set out in subsection     (4).  They are not intended  to be exhaustive,  and the amount
    of weight to be attached to each will depend on the circum-    stances of the particular case.       (7).Provision is  made for  dealing  with the case of sewers    or disposal works which are within the district of one authority    but serve that  of another.  39.  We considered whether the owner of a sewer or of disposalworks should have a right to- appeal from a  decision of the localauthority to take over the sewer or works as well as from a decision not to take  over.   In  view of the fact that  sewers and disposalworks nearly always represent a liability rather than an  asset,  we reached the conclusion that this&apos; was unnecessary.  40.  The question whether  the  appeal  under  Clause 17  froma decision of the local authority declining to take over a sewer shouldlie to  a court of summary jurisdiction or to the Minister  presentedsome  -difficulty.  In the present instance  we were led to the con-clusion that  the appellate tribunal should be  the  Minister by theconsideration that the issue is closely bound up with the questionwhether the local authority are adequately performing their  duty ofdraining their district.   The responsibility for enforcing the perform-ance of this duty rests  with the Minister under Section  299 of theAct of 1875  and Section 57 of the Local Government Act, 1929,both of which  provisions are reproduced in Part  XII of the Bill,and for that reason we consider that  the  jurisdiction to determine whether a particular sewer ought to become  vested in  the localauthority as forming part of the general system of the district shouldalso lie with the Minister.  41.  The procedure outlined in the last three paragraphs  dealswith sewers  completed  after the commencement of the Bill.  It isnecessary, however, to  make  provision for the further  and  moredifficult case  of sewers completed  before that date.   These  are dealt  with  in  Clauses 20 and 24.   The  former  enumerates the types of sewers which  are to  vest, or to continue to vest, in thelocal  authority  and  designates them  &apos;&apos; public  sewers.&apos;&apos;.   Theopening words of  subsection, (1) maintain the status  quo by pro-viding that all sewers and disposal works already  vested  in a localauthority shall continue to  be  vested in them.  Those which  arenot so vested, e.g., existing sewers made for profit, will remain in private ownership.  Paragraph (a) of Clause 20 (1) deals with sewers which under thegeneral law  would have become vested in local  authorities, but,being of the nature of  private drains, are the  subject of some pro-vision in a local Act which maintains the responsibility of the ownerto keep them in repair.  We have come to the conclusion that as a-matter of procedure the convenient course will be for these sewersto be  vested in the local authority and to be known as public sewers.The liability for their maintenance is  dealt with in Clause 24.
  Paragraph (b) sufficiently explains itself; and  Paragraphs (c) and (d) deal with future sewers.  &quot;With regard  to  the proviso to Subsection  (2), see  the note onClause 20.  Clause  24 defines the responsibility as  between local  authoritiesand owners for the expense of maintaining lines of pipes (includingsewers falling under Clause 20 (1)  (a) ) laid before the commence-ment of the Bill.  For  the,reasons explained in paragraphs  32-34above, the maintenance  of these pipes has in many cases remained the responsibility of the owners, notwithstanding that the pipes are,or would under  the general  law be,  sewers.   This responsibilityrests in some cases on contract, in others on local Act  provisions,and in others on Section 19 of  the  Act of  1890,  either  as  it stands or as amended by local Act.   The  clause is based on theconsideration that  Parliament has  enabled  local  authorities tfoadopt Section 19 of the Act of 1890, which applies  both to futuresewers and to sewers already in existence at the date  of adoption;and further, that  it  has allowed  the  section  to be amended so as to cover both the case of drains of houses in the  same owner-ship and that of drains constructed voluntarily and not by reason ofa requirement  of the local authority, thus in effect reversing theWood Green and Aldershot decisions already referred to.  We have attempted to draft the clause so as  to give effect to the view whichwe think, having  regard to these considerations,  the  legislaturemay fairly be presumed  to have accepted.  Subsection (1) of the clause  enables the local authority to recoverthe  expense of  maintaining a public sewer of  the  kind to which the clause applies  from  the owners of the premises served by it, md provides for any necessary  apportionment between  different owners.  Subsection (2) deals with the not infrequent case of  an authority not only  maintaining, but  enlarging such a sewer.  In that case the authority will be required  to pay the cost  of enlargement, and, since an  apportionment of future maintenance expenses  would tecome increasingly difficult, as time goes on, the subsection pro- tides that the  future responsibility for maintenance is to lie with the local  authority.  Subsection (3) gives the owner a right of  appeal to  a court of inmmary jurisdiction on questions arising under  the clause.  Subsection (4) describes the sewers to which  the  clause applies.  paragraph (a)  deals with the  case  in which the responsibility for  aintenance has remained with the owners either under  a local Act  1&apos; by virtue of an  agreement with  the  local authority.    Para-   ph (b) represents an attempt to define the kind  of sewer at  hich Section  19, as  amended  by local  Acts,  is aimed.   The  wer must be one which was not constructed  at the expense of the
local authority and one which lies either in the gardens .or yards of the  houses served  by it, or in some private  passage or roadwayaffording access to them.                     Sewers  made for profit.  &apos;42. Section 13 of the Act of 1875, which provides for the vestingof sewers in  the local; authority,  excepts &quot;sewers made  by  anyperson for, his own  profit, or by any  company for the profit ofthe shareholders.&quot;  &apos;  These words have given rise to litigation  and  it is hot easy to reconcile all the judicial decisions, but we believe&apos;that in broad outline the effect of the decisions, including an important decisionrecently  given  in  the case  of  Southstrand Estate DevelopmentCompany v. East Preston B.D.C.  [1934] 1 Ch. 254, may be statedas follows :        (a) whether  a  sewer is made for, profit, is a question of fact;       (b) a  sewer  may  be made for profit though made purely1    for sanitary purposes and not,-e.g., for  securing, a profit by    disposing of the sewage;       (c) the fact  that a sewer is  made by  a person  developing    a building estate in order to provide sanitation for  the houses    does  not in itself constitute sufficient evidence that it  was    made for profit;       (d) on  the other  hand,  if  a  sewer  is  made by a. person    (other than the  developer of the estate)  who has purchased    the right to construct it with the object of turning the  right to    account,  it is made for  profit.  43; The exception  of  sewers made  for  profit,  dates -from  thePublic Health Act, 1848, and probably  owes its origin largely tothe idea  which was  then  current,  and gave  rise  to the  SewageUtilisation Acts, 1865-7, that the disposal of sewage would in itself be  a  profitable undertaking.  Whatever the  future may hold instore in this respect, it cannot  be gainsaid that the creation of asewerage  system with a view  to profit from this source is at presentunknown in  this&apos;country.  Thus, under existing  conditions, thequestion  whether a  sewer is or  is  not made for profit  usuallydepends  on whether the  developer  recoups himself  for the costof  the  sewer  by  obtaining a  larger  price for  his land  orhouses, or  by  levying,  through  the agency  of - some company or other  body  created  for the  purpose,  charges  in  the natureof rates  for  the use of the sewer,  or  selling the right  to levysuch  charges.  It  appears  to  us that  the  distinction  between these  two methods  of  procedure  forms  a  very unsatisfactoryground,  as  a matter of  equity between the  developer  andIthegeneral body of ratepayers,  for  determining  whether the  localauthority should have a right to take over the sewer, or should berequired to purchase it from the developer in  cases where it is
found that  tbe sewer  forms  an important link in the  generalsewerage system of tbe district.  Accordingly we recommend thatthe new procedure for taking over by declaration should apply to future sewers  whether made for profit  or  not,  and Clause  17 soprovides.  We are fortified in the view that the  distinction betweensewers made for profit and those not made for  profit may withoutunfairness be  abandoned,  first, by  the  fact that the practice ofrecovering the cost of the sewer in the price of the land or houses is,we believe, almost universal, and that consequently, if the Bill wereto make the system of levying a charge for the use of the  sewervirtually impossible, the effect on the current practice of developerswould be  negligible;  and  secondly, by  the consideration  that as already pointed out, the proposed procedure  for taking over appliesonly to sewers completed after  the commencement of the Bill,  andthat the position of existing  sewers made  for  profit will remainunaffected.                   Sewage  Disposal  Works.  44. The  foregoing  considerations apply substantially  to  thequestion of taking over sewage disposal works.  There is, however,this difference between sewers  and sewage disposal works, that thelatter  are  not mentioned in Section 13 of  the  Act of 1875,  andtill  recently  the view was commonly held  that  disposal works donot automatically vest in the local authority.  Doubt has been caston this view  by two recent decisions, Clark v. Epsom R.D.G. [1929]  Ch. 287, and Solihull R.D.C. v. Ford  [1932] 30 L.G-.R. 4s4.   Itappears  to us that whatever  the intention of the earlier Acts mayhave been, there is no ground in  principle for distinguishing, asregards works constructed in the future, between sewers and sewage disposal works, and we recommend  that they should be treated onthe same  footing.                        Trade Effluents.  45. The law with regard  to the duty of a  local  authority toreceive trade effluents into- their sewers  is also in an unsatisfactory state.  It is  to be found principally in  Sections 15 and  21  of  theAct of 1875, which  lay down the general duty of a local authorityto make and maintain sewers and to allow owners to connect their Irains with  such  sewers, and in Section 7 of the Rivers Pollution Prevention Act, 1876.   This last section provides in effect  that a local authority must give facilities  for  enabling manufacturers to any the liquids proceeding from their factories into the authority&apos;s sewers,  but  qualifies this obligation by excluding from the right of admission to a sewer, liquid which  would be  injurious  &quot; in a  anitary point  of view,&quot;  and  also by exempting the  authority from any  obligation to give  facilities &quot;  where the sewers of such minority are only sufficient for the requirements of their district.&quot; Section  10 of  the same Act  confers a general  jurisdiction on  the county  court to deal with contraventions and  defaults  under  the   33H1                                                     B
Act  and is apparently drafted in terms wide  enough to  cover a default  by  a local authority in their duty to give facilities.  46. The  precise extent of the obligation under  Section 7 andthe relation  of  that  section to the provisions of the Act  of  1875have given rise  to much discussion, and it is  generally agreed thatthe law on this subject is in urgent need of revision.  We under-stand  that  negotiations  have  been  proceeding  for  some  time between the Central  Council for Rivers Protection, the Federationof British  Industries  and certain  of  the  Associations  of LocalAuthorities,  that a  substantial measure of  agreement  has  beenreached and indeed that a Bill has actually  been drafted.   In  viewof this, we have thought if right  to reproduce  the  existing lawsubstantially as it stands.   If  any legislation on the matter pre-cedes the introduction of the  Bill, it might  without difficulty be incorporated  in  the  general  Bill.   We  have  not  thought  itnecessary  to reproduce  Section  10  of  the  Pavers  PollutionPrevention  Act,  1876,  so  far  as   it  covers,  or  may cover,cases of default by a local authority  under Section 7 of the sameAct.  In our view  the general  default procedure of the PublicHealth  Acts which is reproduced in Part XII of the present Billis more appropriate.   The  remaining  sections of the Act  of  1876dealing  with pollution of  rivers do not fall within the scope of thepresent  Bill.      Meaning  of &quot;  house,&quot; &quot; building &quot; and &quot; premises.&quot;  47. By Section 4 of the Act of 1875  &quot; house &quot;  was defined as including&quot;  &quot; schools,  also factories  and  other buildings  in which more than 20 persons are employed at one time.&quot;  The referenceto 20 persons w^as struck out by Section 107  of the Factories and workshops Act, 1878, and  accordingly the definition now runs:&quot; includes  schools,  also  factories  and  other  buildings  in which persons are employed.&quot;  The word &quot; building &quot; is  not defined in the Act of 1875 and theword &quot; premises &quot;  is defined  as including messuages,  buildings,lands, easements and hereditaments of any tenure.  In &apos;some of the later Public Health Acts the draftsmen appear to have overlookedthese definitions.  48. It seems probable that  the extended meaning of the  word&quot; house &quot;  was adopted in the Act of 1875 principally with referenceto the  provisions relating to drains and sanitary  conveniences, FORthe reason that  those provisions were  intended to apply to buildings which  were not  houses  in  the  ordinary sense  of the term. - it became clear, however, as. we proceeded with the  drafting of theBill  that   the  adoption  of  this  Vide  definition  of   &quot; house&quot;throughout the Bill  as a whole would  play  havoc with many ofits  provisions and produce  quite unexpected  results,  and accord&apos;ingly,  after trying various  alternative expedients, we  have  come
to the conclusion that the simplest course is to use  the three termsr&apos; house,&quot;  &quot; building &quot; and &quot; premises &quot;  in  their normal senses,that is, house as meaning  a dwelling-house,  building as  coveringbuildings  of all  types, and  premises as  the most  general  termof all,  covering  buildings and land.   In the  clauses dealing withdrains  and sanitary conveniences the word &quot; building &quot;  has been used for the reasons explained in the  notes  on  these clauses.                       Passing  of Plans.  49. Under the existing law a local  authority are under an obliga-tion to pass the plans  of a  proposed  building  if they conform withthe  byelaws. The authority have no discretion in the&quot; matter.  Weconsider it important to maintain this obligation and have draftedClause 63 with  the object  of making the  position clearer than itis at present.  There are, however, a  number of matters throughoutthis Part of the Bill (e.g., the provision of proper drains) in whichthe  building owner must   comply with the  requirements of thelocal authority, and in fairness to the owner he should be informed that the  earliest  possible moment whether or not his proposals onthese matters are acceptable.  We have come to the conclusion thatthe  best way to achieve this is to require the local authority to dealwith the  point  on  the submission of the plans  of the proposedbuilding and to reject the plans if their requirements are not met,the  owner being given any  necessary  right of  appeal.  The clauses in which this procedure has been adopted are 25, 37,  42, 52, 53, 54and 58.                     Sanitary conveniences.  50. Under the Act of 1875 the obligations of persons  erecting buildings and of the owners of existing buildings in  the matter of closet accommodation are as follow :       (1)  Under Section 35 of the Act of  1875 it is an offence to    erect a house (in the wide meaning of the term given to  it by    Section 4 of the Act) &quot; without a sufficient water-closet, earth-    closet or privy  and an  ashpits furnished with proper doors and    coverings.&apos;&apos;      (2)  Under Section 36 of the same Act a local authority may    require  the owner or occupier of a house which is  without a    sufficient water-closet,  earth-closet, etc., to provide the neces-    sary convenience,  and  in default may execute the necessary    work  at his expense.  These two sections have  been the subject of a number of judicial decisions which need not here be discussed  in  detail.  It suffices to say that whereas (subject to later legislation mentioned  below) an owner has a right to put into his house such type of closet  or privy as he thinks fit,  provided  that it  conforms with the byelaws, it appears from the  decision  in  the case of Garlton  Main  Colliery Company, Limited  v.  Hemsworth R.D.C.  [1922] 2  Ch. 609 that   33141                                                   B 2
there may be circumstances justifying a local authority insistingunder Section 36 that privies shall be replaced by water-closets.  Section 39 of the  Act of 1907, a  section occupying more than two pages of the  statute book, has  given rise to much  misunder-standing.  After commencing with elaborate definitions of different types of closets,  it proceeds to  enact that where there  are  &quot;  asufficient water supply and sewer &apos;&apos; (this phrase being defined in thesection), a local authority may require a new building to be pro-vided with such  number of sufficient water-closets  and/or slop-closets as the circumstances may  render necessary.  Subsection  (3)  empowers the  local  authority, if satisfied  that sufficient closet accommodation is not provided in connection withan existing building, and cannot be provided by the alteration of theexisting accommodation &apos;&apos; in pursuance of this  section &quot;, to requirethe owner to provide  the necessary number of proper and sufficientwater and/or slop-closets.  Subsection (4)  enables the  local  authority, where  there are  asufficient water supply  and  sewer, to require the owner of  a build-ing to replace existing  closet accommodation,  other than a water-closet&apos;or slop-closet, with a water-closet or slop-closet, but providesfor the local authority contributing half the expense.  If, however,the conversion is  from  a pail-closet  to a water-closet, the wholeexpenditure must  be  borne by the local authority.  Subsection (5) provides that the references throughout the section to slop-closets are not to have effect, unless the  Minister  is satis-fied by the local authority that the circumstances of the district are such as to render it necessary or expedient that  they  should haveeffect and makes an appropriate order.  Section 39 of the Act of  1907 has been put  into force in  a largenumber of local government areas, and since  its operation is auto-matically limited by the requirement that  the conversion to a watercarriage system can only be  insisted on &apos;&apos; where there are a sufficientwater supply and sewer &quot;, we see no reason why, subject to this limitation, it should  not form part of the general law.  In so faras  it deals with cases in which the owner of  the building can berequired to take action  entirely at his own expense,  it clearly oughtto be amalgamated with Section 36 of the Act of 1875.  51. Section 36 of the Act of 1875 and Section  39  of the Act of 190?present an example which may be worth mention  of the danger of a mere &quot; scissors and paste &quot; method of consolidating Acts of Parlia-ment.   The relation between these  two  sections was  the  subjectof much discussion in  the  Carlton Main  Colliery case cited above,and it was contended that the scope and effect  of the earlier sectionwas limited by the presence in the statute book of the later.  this contention was rejected and observations were made  from the Benchon the question of construing an earlier1 Act by reference to  a laterHence  a consolidation  which merely placed  the two  sections in
juxtaposition  in  the same Act might well have unexpected con-sequences.  The two sections  are accordingly wholly rewritten.  52. As regards the erection of new buildings, we feel no doubtthat Parliament  would decline at the present date to legislate interms  of a new building being provided  with a  &quot; privy  and  anashpit furnished with proper  doors and coverings  &quot;.   Accordinglywe recommend that in every  case in which closet accommodation is necessary there should be  an obligation to provide either a water-closet or an earth-closet,  the latter being defined as a closet with amoveable receptacle.  We have considered whether  a  water-closetshould be required in every  case in. which a sufficient water supplyand sewer are available within the meaning of Clause 89 (6)  of theBill.   It is clear that the local authority  should be in a  positionto insist upon this, and we have no doubt that in the  great majorityof cases they will do so.  But occasionally cases may  arise in whicheither owing to some preference on the part of an owner-occupier ofa house or because notwithstanding that a water supply and sewerare available  there is some technical difficulty in making a con-nection with  the sewer  (e.g.  owing  to the house being built  onrock) it will  be  convenient if the  local authority have power to approve an earth-closet.  Provision is made in Clause 42  accordingly.  53. Sections 35  and 36 of the  Act  of 1875 are drafted in termsof &quot; houses &quot; as defined in Section 4 of the same Act and, as in thecase of the obligation to  construct a drain  (see note on Clause 37),the question arises to what type of  building the  obligations withregard to closet accommodation should extend.   We have  come tothe conclusion that it is  not practicable to define in the Act itself a class of  buildings which must in all circumstances be furnished with closet accommodation,  and accordingly that the proper course is to leave to the discretion of  the local authority (subject to appealto a court&apos; of  summary jurisdiction)  both. the question whether acloset is necessary at all  and, if so, the further question how manyclosets are required.  This is provided in Clauses 42-3.  54. With regard to the type of apparatus, if the  recommendationwhich  we make  in paragraph  65  below is  accepted that  the Minister should  be able  to require all  local authorities to make byelaws dealing with buildings and sanitation, this matter will  be governed by the byelaws in  operation in the area.  This will have, in our opinion, substantial  advantages from the point  of  view of owners as  compared with the  present law  under which the owner MAY be left in the dark when the house is under construction and discover too late  that the local authority, and possibly  the  justices on appeal,  do  not  accept  his  view  as  to  what   constitutes &quot;sufficient &quot;  accommodation.  55. The position with  regard to buildings  existing  at the date of the commencement of the Bill is more difficult.   Many of these &quot;ill contain closet accommodation constructed before any  byelaws   33U1                                                    B 3
dealing with the matter were in operation in the area.   Under theexisting law an owner is under no obligation to alter a closet whichis otherwise &quot;  sufficient &quot;, merely because it does not conform withbyelaws which were brought into  force after the date of its con-struction and  would govern its reconstruction if it  were altered.Moreover, the  duty to  substitute a water-closet for any  other typeonly arises (a) if the closet is not sufficient, (b) if sufficient accom-modation cannot be provided by the alteration of the closet, and (c)if there are a sufficient  water supply  and  sewer available.  an amendment of the law which imposed on owners a general duty of bringing existing closet accommodation into conformity with newbyelaws, whether or not desirable in itself, would be, in our opinion,quite beyond the scope of the present Bill.   We have accordinglyreproduced  in  Clauses 43  and 44 what we take to be the principleof the existing law.  Clause 43  deals with  the  case  of  existing  buildings withoutsufficient closets or having closets the  state  of  which is unsatis-factory and which  cannot  be put into proper condition without recon-struction.   In  this case the owner  can  be required to do what isnecessary to provide additional closets or  to put  the existing onesinto a proper  condition, as the case may be.  The  authority areentitled under the clause  to  require the  substitution of a water-closet for an existing earth-closet,  if a sufficient  water supply andsewer are available.  New closets provided under the clause wouldhave  to conform with the  requirements of the  current byelaws.  Clause 44 deals with the case of closets  which  are  in  an un-satisfactory state,, but can be put right without reconstruction. Inthis case the  owner or occupier  can be  required to do what isnecessary to cure the defect, but this will not necessarily involvebringing the closet up to the standard of current byelaws.  56.  Clause 46 which replaces Section 39  (4) of the Act of 1907deals with  the case in which a sufficient  water  supply  and sewerare available, and  the local authority  consider that as a  matter ofgeneral sanitary policy  the existing closets  should be replaced bywater-closets, notwithstanding that they are  not in themselves anuisance or injurious to health or insufficient in  number.  In this case, as under  the  existing law, the expense is to be shared equally between the local  authority and the owner.  Two amendments which the clause makes in the  existing law should  be mentioned :        (1) As already stated,  Section  39 of  the  Act of 1907, after     defining a &quot; slop-closet &quot;  as a closet  comprising provision fori     the flushing of  the  receptacle by  means  of  slops  or waste    liquids  of  the household or rain-water,  enacts that&apos; the pro-    visions as  to slop-closets are not to apply, unless  the Minister    has declared that the circumstances of the district are such M    to  render  it necessary or expedient that they should apply.
The section was apparently framed on the view that a. slop-closet is a reasonably satisfactory type of sanitary convenience,and in  some circumstances might  be treated  as  on the same footing as an ordinary water-closet.  It appears that no orders have ever been made under this subsection, the Local Govern-ment Board and the Ministry entertaining considerable doubt as  to what  the order-making power was  intended to  achieveand what actual effect an order made under it  would have (seeLumley&apos;s note to the subsection).  We understand moreoverthat the practice of  installing slop-closets  has  now been aban-abandoned,  the modern  view  being  that this type of apparatus is wholly  unsatisfactory.  Accordingly,  we have  followed  a  pre-cedent  set in  many modern local  Acts, and have framed  theclause  so as to place slop-closets on the same footing as earth-closets  and privies and to enable the local authority to requirethe owner to bear half the cost of converting them into water-closets.  (2) Under  Section 39  (4)  a local authority  are not entitledto throw on the owner any  part of the cost of substituting  awater-closet for a pail-closet.  This exception, which appearsto have been made on  the ground  that  the  owner may on some past occasion have been required by the council  to  sub-stitute a pail-closet for a privy, and that it  would be a hardshipif he were called upon to bear even  a part of the expense ofa further replacement, places a practical  obstacle in the  wayof schemes for conversion on the basis of the owner and  thelocal authority sharing the cost.   We  understand  that cases have arisen in  which owners, on becoming aware that such  ascheme is  in  contemplation, have at  comparatively  triflingexpense substituted  a pail-closet for a privy, and thus  thrownthe whole of  the cost of  the  conversion  to a water-carriagesystem  on the rates.   Such a practice is clearly in conflict withthe intention of Section 39, and for  this  reason, and in viewof the general advance in sanitary standards  since  1907,  werecommend that, for purposes of conversion, pail-closets shouldbe put  on the  same footing as  earth-closets and privies,  andthe owner be made liable to bear one-half of the expense.  this change  has  already  been effected by  a number of local Actsand by  provisional orders amending local Acts.   Sanitary accommodation in Factories,  Workshops, etc. 57. The existing law with regard to  sanitary accommodation in factories and other places where persons are employed in  trade orEasiness, is briefly as follows  Under Section 38 of the Act of 1875 a local authority may require  owner or occupier of a building, used or intended to be used asfactory or building in which persons of both sexes are employed or 33141                                                   B 4
 intended to be employed in manufacture, trade or business, to con- struct a sufficient number of water-closets, earth-closets, or privies and ash pits, for the separate use of each sex.   Section 22 of the Act of 1890 requires a building used as a work- shop or manufactory, or where persons are employed or intended to be employed in trade or  business,  to be provided  with sufficient and suitable sanitary accommodation, having regard  to the number of persons employed in or in attendance at the building and, where persons of both sexes are employed or in attendance,  with proper separate accommodation.  The section empowers the  local authority to call  upon the owner or  occupier to make such alterations and additions in his building as  may be required to give  such sufficient suitable  and proper accommodation.  This section is &quot; adoptive&quot; in urban areas and may be put in force  by order of the Minister in rural areas.    It is  in  operation  in 306 boroughs, 673 urban districts and 19 rural districts.  Where it operates,  Section 38 of the earlier Act is repealed.  It will be observed that the earlier section is, but the  later is not,limited to buildings in which persons of both sexes are employed.  Further  provision is made  in this  matter by Section 9 of theFactory and Workshop Act, 1901.  This section requires  every fac-tory and workshop to be provided with sufficient and suitable accom-modation in the way of sanitary conveniences, regard being had tothe number of persons employed, or in  attendance, and where per-sons of both sexes  are employed, or  in  attendance, with properseparate accommodation. The section also empowers the Secretaryof State by special order to determine what is sufficient  and suitable accommodation.  The  section does  not,  however, apply  in  anydistrict  in which Section 22 of the Act of 1890 is in  force.  More-over, it  does not apply to  &quot; men&apos;s workshops &quot;, i.e.,  those not employing any woman,  young person or child (see Section 157 ofthe Act).  Under Section 4 of the same Act the Secretary of State has powerto enforce the sanitary provisions of the Public Health Acts as re-gards factories, workshops and workplaces, and by Section 5  a Home Office Inspector may call upon the borough or district council to take the necessary action for the purpose of enforcing these provisions.  The position is,  therefore, that in  any particular  district either Section 22 of the Act  of 1890 is in force or both Section&apos; 38 of the Act of 1875, and Section 9 of the Factory  and Workshop Act, 1901, operate.   58. It is  tempting  to replace the  complexities  of  this dual system  by a single  code based on Section 22  of the Act of 1890. This, however,  would. involve the drastic  step of repealing Sec- tion 9 of the Act of 1901.   In this connection our  attention has been drawn to the fact that since the year 1924 successive govern- ments have had under consideration a Factories Bill  which was in-
introduced in 1924 and again in 1926, and has subsequently been thesubject of prolonged consultation with the interests concerned. Thepolicy of this Bill as regards sanitary conditions in factories has been to place in the hands of the Secretary of State the duty of prescrib-ing  and enforcing proper standards of sanitary accommodation, butto empower him  to delegate  the  duty of  enforcement  to  localauthorities.   We  understand that this  policy has been  generally accepted and it is clear that a total repeal of Section 9 of the Act  of1901 would be inconsistent with it. 59. In view of the  possibility of factory legislation on these lines in the near future,  we have come to the conclusion that the proper course for us is to maintain, so far as practicable,  the status quo andthat this can best be secured by substantially reproducing Section 22of the Act of 1890 as regards boroughs and urban  districts and thoserural districts, 19 in all,  in which it is in force.  Provision is madefor  this in  Clause 45,  subsection  (5)  of  which further providesthat Section 9  of the Act of 1901  is not to  apply to boroughs orurban districts or to rural districts  in which Section 22 of the act of 1890 is at present in force and that similarly it is not to apply toa rural district in which  the powers conferred by Clause 45 are putinto force by an order of the Minister under Part I of the  Bill. We think also that Section  38 should be  repealed without re-enactment, and the position  of rural districts in which Clause  45is not in force  should be regulated solely by  Section 9  of the act of 1901.  It  is  true that this  will  deprive  these rural  districts of their existing power under Section 38 of dealing  with factories and workshops where both sexes  are  employed.  We think how-ever that this change in  the law is justified on the  ground that thepower overlaps with those of  the Secretary  of State  under Section9 of the Act of  1901, and that in practice it  is little more than adead letter.   Further, the change  accords with  the contemplated factory  legislation  under  which the  power  of  enforcing  proper accommodation would be vested in the Secretary  of State, but may be  delegated by him to  local authorities. 60. Reference  should also be made to the question of shops.  The provision of sanitary accommodation in shops has  recently  been bit with by the Shops Act, 1934, which provides (Section 10 (2)) 8iat in every shop, other  than an exempted shop,  there shall be pro- titled and maintained suitable and sufficient sanitary conveniences ijailable for the use of  persons  employed  in or about the  shop. Subsection  (6)  of the same section  enables the  local authority  to -nut a certificate of exemption if satisfied &quot;  that by reason of re- dieted accommodation, or other special circumstances affecting the WP, it is reasonable that such a certificate should be in  force with1spect  thereto  and  that suitable  and  sufficient  sanitary  con- &apos;8&amp;iencies   .   .  .  are  otherwise  conveniently  -available &quot;.    A J?bt of appeal to  the county  court  against  the withdrawal  of  a
certificate  (but  not against a refusal to grant a certificate) is cor..ferred.  The Act does not repeal any of the provisions of the PublicHealth Acts.   In order to avoid overlapping jurisdiction,  shops towhich the Act  of  1934 applies are specifically  excluded from theoperation of Clauses 43 to 45.Power of local authority to require  owner to execute works and in             default to  execute them at his  expense.  61. A considerable number of the enactments reproduced in thisPart, and a few of those reproduced in other  Parts, of the  Bill pro-vide in .e&apos;ffect that the local authority may serve notice on the owner(or in some cases  on the owner or the occupier)  of premises CALL-ing upon him to execute works in order to remedy  some defect,and that if the person served fails to do so, the authority may DO THEwork themselves and recover the expense from him.   These enact-ments are scattered over the various Public Health Acts AND,  as might be  expected, substantial  differences  both  of form AND  of substance  are  to  be found.   In  some cases, for example, theobligation  on the  owner  to do the necessary work is imposed bythe statute itself and a failure renders him  immediately  liable  TOa penalty.   In others, the liability arises only if the authority  servenotice requiring the works to be done and the notice is disregarded.Again, in  some cases the statute requires the notice to specify THEworks to be done  and the time within which they are to be  com-pleted.  In other cases the authority is merely required to call uponthe owner to do what is necessary.   Further, as already explained in paragraph 18 of this Report the  position under the existing lawwith  regard to  the owner&apos;s  right of appeal is obscure and unsatis-factory.   62. We feel no  doubt that for the sake of simplicity and claritythe procedure throughout the Bill for requiring an owner to remedydefects  and  enabling  him  to  appeal  should be uniform, ANDfurther, that before incurring the expense of executing the necessaryworks in default Of  the owner, the local authority should be in aposition to know  whether their requirements can be successfullychallenged as excessive or unreasonable or as being for any reasonultra vires.  We have accordingly  made provision in Clause 283 ofthe  Bill for a  uniform  procedure  on the following lines :         (1)  The  local authority will be empowered to serve noticed     the owner (or  in  some cases  on the owner  or  occupier) re-     quiring him to execute within a stated time the works indicated     in the notice.   In our opinion the authority should be  under AI     obligation  to  indicate the works which they require, BUT NO!     to incorporate in the notice a  detailed &quot; specification &quot;, in *     technical  sense of  the term, and wTe have accordingly avoideJ     the use of  the word &quot; specify &quot; in this connection.        (2) Within 21  days  the owner may appeal to A  courts     summary jurisdiction, with a further right of appeal to quarts
   sessions.   An appeal  will lie  on one or more of the  several   grounds stated in subsection (3) of the clause.     (3) If the local authority have power to impose the require-   ment either on  the owner or the occupier, the person actually   served with the  notice (whether owner or occupier) may appeal   on the  ground that the obligation should have been imposed,   wholly  or partly  on  the other party.   In that case he must   serve a copy of the notice of appeal on the other party and the   court will decide between them.  In reaching a decision as   between owner and  occupier  the  court  are  required  to have.   regard to the terms of the  tenancy  and the nature of the works   required. Similarly, if the works are for the joint benefit of  two   or more houses the owner of one can  appeal on the ground that   the expense ought to fall wholly, or in a greater degree, on   some other owner.     (4) Subject to the  right of appeal, if the person served with   the notice makes default, the local authority  may  do the work   and recover the  reasonable expenses from him.  In addition, he   is  liable to  a fine for failure to comply with the authority&apos;s   requirements.     (5) Whether the right of appeal is exercised or not, an issue   which might be raised on  appeal  cannot be  taken by  way of   defence in proceedings  brought by the local authority for re-   coy ery  of  the expense. 63. It may be objected to the procedure that, if the local autho-rity have a right to  do  the work in  default  and to recover  theexpense from  the owner,  nothing further  is  required,  and  thatto give them the additional right of taking proceedings for penaltiesis unnecessary and harsh.   On this two comments may be made.in the first place, a right to do the work in default and/or to  pro-ceed for penalties is  common not only throughout the Public Healthhaw but in similar codes.  Secondly, if it is conceded that  theobligation  to keep his premises in sanitary  repair rests  primarily with the owner and only secondarily  with the local  authority, it follows  that  the authority  must  have some weapon  which  willenable them to induce the owner to perform his duty.  In practice,the institution of proceedings  for a penalty, or a notice that they re about to be instituted, constitutes  a  most effective weapon forthis purpose.  If proceedings are taken, it is common for the court to accept an undertaking on the part  of  the defendant to execute the works,  and  to adjourn the case to enable  this undertaking to oe  carried out.  If the works  are  duly completed, the information 8 usually dismissed without a fine.      Byelaws with respect to Buildings and to  Sanitation.  64. The  existing  enactments on this subject are to be found in Sections 157 to 159 of the  Act of  1875,  Section 23 of the Act of 1890, Section 24 of the Act of 1907, and Section 101 of the Housing
Act, 1925.  Apart from  the  last-mentioned section, which enablesunreasonable byelaws in certain circumstances to be revoked, theoriginal provisions of the Act of 1875 have remained substantially unchanged,  for the provisions in the Acts of 1890 and 1907 are inthe main  directed to extending in certain respects the scope of thebyelaw-making powers.  But the subject  of building byelaws has given rise to so much controversy and litigation (Lumley&apos;s note onSection 157 extends over some 23 pages) that we should hesitatemerely  to recommend  a re-enactment  of  the existing law as it stands.    Fortunately, however, the  whole matter  has been thesubject  of an exhaustive enquiry made by a  Departmental Com-mittee appointed by the  President of the Local Government board in 1914, which, after being  -in  abeyance during the War, made aReport  (Cd. 9213)  in  1918.    This Report contains a  number of recommendations for amending the law, and  while  some of theserelate to streets, and are for that reason outside the scope of thepresent  Bill, there is a substantial residue of which any Bill dealingwith building byelaws must necessarily take account.  65. In  the  notes on  Clauses  60 to 69 we call attention to anumber of points in which effect has been given to the recommenda-tions of this  Committee.   In  addition to these there  are somematters of  greater importance  which may be mentioned here.  The Departmental Committee recommended that byelaw-makingpowers  should be given to  all local authorities  alike and that everydistrict  should be required to  have at  least  a minimum code(Report, paragraph 109).   At the date when their report was issuedthere were  some 450  rural  authorities  without byelaws.  On 1stOctober,  1935, the number of rural  districts in which no build-ing byelaws were in operation had been reduced  to 60.  The considerations which  led to the Departmental Committee torecommend the general application of a system of building byelawsare set  out in their report, and the course of events since the report was published, in particular the widespread development  to whichthe  growth of  motor transport  has  given rise,  lends  additionalweight  to their recommendations.   Moreover, the widely  extendedpowers conferred by the Town  and Country  Planning Act, 1932,on all local authorities  are  a recognition of the  fact that scarcelyany area is free from  the  possibility of development;  and it isdifficult to  contend that a local authority  who have  been  entrustedby Parliament  with the  elaborate task of preparing  a  planningscheme are not to be relied upon to perform the simpler  operationof  framing and  administering a code of byelaws.   Further, tofact that the number  of areas without byelaws is now less than:seventh of  the  number  in 1918 makes  the proposed change nrodless revolutionary.  We are satisfied that the time has now cornwhen it should be made.   66. We meed  only add that in our view the universal  adoptioiof a minimum code of building byelaws would be to the advantag
of  property  owners as  well  as  in the interests of  good admini-stration.  To take a  single  example, which  attracted the  atten-tion  of  the Departmental  Committee,  the  right  conferred  bySection 21 of the Act of 1875 on  an owner to cause his  drains toempty into a public sewer,  is qualified by the  requirement thathe must comply with the regulations of  the  local authority,  andthat the work must be subject  to the control  of  the authority&apos;representative  superintending the  making of  the communication.The right  is further curtailed by  Section 38  of  the Act of 1907,which forbids the  communication  being  made until the surveyorlias decided  that the  drain  may properly be connected  with the ewer-a decision from which there is apparently no right of appeal.We believe  that in actual  practice these provisions work wellenough,  but they  leave the  owner  entirely  at  the mercy of thesurveyor and of &quot; regulations &quot; which do not  require the approvalof any central department; and it is clear  that the owner has much less protection from arbitrary requirements than would be the case if he were required to comply with byelaws publicly made by theauthority and confirmed by the Minister of Health.   Further, in anumber of the clauses (e.g.,  Clause  42  reproducing Section 39  (2)of  the Act of 1907) we  have found it necessary  to provide a pro-cedure  which  assumes  the  existence  of byelaws  requiring  the deposit of plans of proposed buildings and in the absence of byelawsthese provisions  would prove unworkable.  This is  more than a technical difficulty, for unless the  local authority are placed in aposition  to make  their requirements,  e.g.,  with  regard to  the drainage of the building, at  the earliest possible  stage (that is,  onthe submission of plans), the building owner  may be put to quiteunnecessary expense in having to  comply with these requirementsat a stage when compliance may involve an expensive alteration ofhis building.  67. It does not  follow that areas  of sparse population require a byelaw code of  anything like the  complexity  appropriate to urban areas.  The practice adopted by the  Ministry  of  Health of issuingthree model codes an urban, a rural and an  intermediate code indicates the proper procedure, and it will be  seen  from  Clause 60 of  the draft Bill,  which imposes the obligation  to make  bye- laws that the authority are not bound to  do more than make bye- laws with  respect  to any particular  matter  &quot; if required by  the Minister.&quot;  68. Further, the Departmental  Committee attached great  iiti- portance to securing that building  byelaws should  not be allowed to become  obsolete, and made  two recommendations  for  this purpose :       (a) They suggested that  Section 44 of  the Housing and -  Town Planning, etc. Act, 1909, which gave the Local Govern -    ment Board  power  in  certain circumstances  to require  the    repeal  of an  existing  byelaw,  should be  strengthened and
    extended :  (Report, paragraph 35).   Effect was given to this    recommendation by Section 13 of the Housing, etc. Act,  1923,    which was reproduced  as  Section  101 in the  Consolidating    Act of 1925 and now appears in an unaltered form in Clause 68    of the draft Bill;       (b) They further recommended that a time limit on the con-    tinuance of byelaws  should he imposed, a period of ten  years    being suggested (Report, paragraph 36).   This recommenda-    tion is carried out in Clause 67 which, however,  will allow the    Minister to extend the period  during which a byelaw  is to    remain in  force.  This  latter  provision does  not conflict with    the general principle, since the decision to  extend the life OF    a byelaw would  compel consideration  of the question whether    the byelaw was still appropriate.  The clause  provides  for a    normal life of ten years, but in view of the changes which the    Bill  would effect we consider that local authorities would be    well advised to reconsider their existing byelaws within a much    shorter period than this from  the passing  of  the Bill,  and we    have  tentatively suggested three years for this  purpose.   The    principle of a ten year period has been adopted  also as regards    byelaws with  respect to water fittings (Clause 132).  69.  In  addition to the recommendations of the  DepartmentalCommittee,  we have had our attention  drawn to  the fact  that,notwithstanding the criticism that has been directed  against thebyelaw system, Parliament  has never hesitated to extend  byelaw-making powers in the widest fashion by means of local legislation.Typical clauses from local  Acts of  recent  date which we  have examined contain provisions,  extending over two or three pages,enlarging the powers of Section 157 of the Act  of  1875  and Section23 of the Act  of 1890.  We have felt it impossible to ignore theattitude  taken by  Parliament in   local  legislation,  but we  havebeen reluctant  to  encumber a general Act with the  great  mass of detail which has been included in  many  local Acts, and we believethat any attempt at exhaustive enumeration will defeat its  purpose by  leading to  a narrow construction being placed on  the generalwords of the clause.  An examination of the common form clausessuggests that these detailed provisions have been thought necessarylargely owing  to certain restrictive  words in Section  157.  Thus,the power to. make byelaws  with respect to the structure of walls,foundations, roofs and chimneys,  is qualified  by the  words  &quot;forsecuring stability and the prevention of  fires and for the purposesof health,&quot; and a similar power with regard to sufficiency of  spacearound buildings is qualified by the words &quot; to secure a free cir-speculation  of  air.&quot;   We have  come  to  the conclusion that the omission  of  both  these phrases would render  it  possible  to  makebyelaws  covering most,  if  not all, of the matters  which Parlia-ment  has  conceded in  local legislation,  without  the necessityfor enumerating these matters at length; and further,  that the
omission of the restrictive words will not unduly enlarge the scopeof byelaws.   It  may be objected  that  the omission of the words&quot; for securing  stability  and the prevention  of  fires and  for thepurposes of health,&quot; would  enable byelaws to be made controlling the structure and materials  of buildings from the point of  view  ofamenity, and that this is outside the  scope of public health legisla-tion.  The practical answer to  this  objection appears  to  be that parliament has, in  the  Town and  Country  Planning  Act,  1932,already  given ample powers to control building from this  pointof view and that for that reason  local authorities are unlikely  todesire, and  the  Minister unlikely  to permit  them, to deal withthe matter in byelaws.  On the other hand, the removal of the limiting  words would  make it possible for byelaws to deal withmaterials of buildings  from  the point of view of the transmission of noise, and it  is thought  that reasonable control  in this matter would be generally welcome.  70. Reference should be made to  certain byelaw-making powers in the existing law  which we have designedly excluded from theBill-      (1) Section 157  of the Act of 1875 enables  byelaws  to  be    made with  respect to  the  &quot; closing of buildings or parts  of    buildings  unfit  for  human habitation and  to  prohibition  of    their use for such  habitation.&quot;  This matter is  so amply dealt    with in  housing legislation that the byelaw-making power has    become  obsolete.      (2) Section 23 of the Act of  1890 enables byelaws to be made    with respect to  the  paving  of yards and  open  spaces  in con-    nection  with dwelling  houses.   This  power is  for practical    purposes superseded by the provisions of Section 25  of the    Act  of 1907 as  amended by  Section  20 of the Act of  1925,    which are reproduced in Clause 55 of the draft Bill.      (3) Section 23 of the Act of 1890  also provides for  byelaws    with respect to the provision of secondary means of access for    the  removal of  house refuse.  This is a  matter which can  be    more simply dealt with in the  statute itself,  and, following    many local  Act precedents,  we have  replaced  the  byelaw-    making  power by Clause 54 of the Bill.                     Temporary Buildings.   71. Section 27 of the Act of 1907, which has  been put in force  in 1551 boroughs and urban districts and  115 rural  districts, pro-  fides that before erecting a temporary building a person must apply  to the local authority for permission.   The authority may grant  or  refuse permission as they think fit,  and, if permission is granted,  May attach conditions with regard to the  sanitary  arrangements,  Egress and  egress,  protection against fire, and  the  period during  *Mch the building may  stand.  Under Section 7 of the Act there
is  a right  of appeal to quarter sessions.  The term &quot; temporarybuilding &quot;  is not  defined, but certain types  of building, including those expressly exempted from the operation of the Public PlealthActs and building byelaws, are excluded from the section.  The section, which has  given  rise to a good  deal of  litigation,represents, like  other sections of  the Act of  1907,  a generalisationof a succession of  local Act  clauses.  It appears to owe its existenceto the  fact  that  neither the Public  Health Act,  1875, nor  theoriginal  byelaws made under it  adequately  provided for the con-struction of buildings of so slight or temporary a kind that  the fullapplication of the &quot; new  buildings &quot; code to  them would be undulyrigorous.   As a  consequence, local authorities, confronted  with cases in which the  application of the Act and byelaws  would pro-duce harsh and  absurd results, tended to fall back on the doctrinethat the particular structure under consideration was not a building at all within the meaning of  the  Act, and some,  though not all, ofthe  judicial  decisions on the subject lent support to this  theory.At a later  stage the objection to  leaving these so-called temporarybuildings free from  all control  became  apparent and as a  resultclauses on which Section 27 is based became  common in local Acts.  72. It is common knowledge that resort is frequently had to theprocedure  under  Section  27  in  the  case of buildings  whichare not temporary in any strict sense.  Judging from the experienceof some members  of the Committee, we believe that the commonesttype of building to which consent is given under  the section is thatof private  garages.   Other buildings of  the most  diverse  descrip-tions,  including sports pavilions, Sunday schools  and tool sheds,were mentioned  to  us  as  having  been dealt with  under  thesection.  The usual practice is for the authority to grant  an annuallicence,  and  these  licences are generally renewed indefinitely solong as the condition of the building remains satisfactory and other circumstances, in particular the proximity of the building to other buildings, do not  alter.   73.  An examination of the Ministry&apos;s  model byelaws  shows thatthese byelaws, which, form the basis of practically all the byelawcodes  throughout  the country,  exempt  altogether from  byelawcontrol  a  number  of buildings  of a minor character, includinggarages which are of less than specified dimensions and are placed ata  specified  minimum distance from other buildings.  It is  clear,therefore,  that  the effect of Section 27,  as administered  at  least in  some areas,  is  to create an intermediate  class of buildingsbetween those which are subject to  full byelaw control and thosewhich are exempt;  and further, that this intermediate class is quiteundefined, the word  &quot; temporary &quot; being a misnomer.   In effect,therefore,  the section is treated  as  enabling  a  local authority to waive their own byelaws in  any  case in which they think it  desir-able.   To re-enact  the  section  for  this  purpose  would not onlyconflict  with Clause  62  which enables byelaws  to be waived,  butonly subject  to the observance of strict  conditions, but would also
go far to destroy the  very objects  which  the byelaw system  is designed to  secure,  namely,  that  of certainty and impartialitybetween owner and owner.  74. For the foregoing reasons we are satisfied that it would-notbe right to re-enact  the section in its present terms, and still less to extend it in those terms to the country as  a whole.   We gavemuch consideration  to  various alternative courses.   One possible solution was to redraft  the  section so as to limit it to buildings which are temporary in fact as well as in name.   This could besecured by providing that consent under the section  should operatefor a limited period  only, and  that after  the  end of  the period thebuilding must be pulled down or altered to  meet byelaw require-ments.  We recognised, however, that if this course were adopted,building owners, either relying on the  reluctance of local authoritiesto take the  extreme  course of  ordering  the  demolition  of thebuilding or because, as  often happens, they genuinely  think thatthey will shortly be in  a position to replace a temporary buildingby something more permanent, would make use of the procedure incases to which it  eventually turned  out  to  be inappropriate; andthat  local authorities, faced with the prospect of having to order the demolition of  a  building which had  been kept in good  repair and  was in fact just as little open  to objection as  when  it  waserected, would probably decline to put their powers into operation.  75. Another and  more  logical course would  be  to  repeal thesection without re-enactment and to  rely on  modern byelaw codesdealing  sufficiently with all types of  buildings  other  than thosewhich they  expressly exempt.   We  rejected this course for  two reasons : first, we doubted whether it would obtain acceptance from local authorities in general and,  secondly, it takes no account of a factor which in our view experience has shown to be  important andwith which the byelaws themselves cannot, deal, namely, the legiti- mate life of a building.   There is no doubt that a provision on the lines of Section 27 has  been rendered less necessary by the  great elaboration of  byelaws   since 1907 and that many  of  the  points which the section is designed to cover by way of conditions could be adequately dealt with in the byelaws  themselves.  But there  is a, case for permitting,  in  certain circumstances and subject to a considerable  degree  of  control,  certain types  of buildings  which should not be allowed to stand as of right for an indefinite  period, for the reason that the  materials of which they are constructed are either liable to rapid deterioration unless  specially preserved,  or are inherently unsuitable for permanent buildings.   Some, though by no means all, types of  wooden  buildings fall within the former class. There is no reason why the byelaw code should not lay down the general  conditions to which these buildings must conform, but the circumstances are so various that it is necessary to  reserve to the  authority, subject to an appeal to a court of  summary jurisdiction,  the right  to  veto the building altogether if,  having  regard to the
 locality  or  for other  special reasons,  its erection would  be unde- undesirable,  or  alternatively to  impose a limitation on the life of the building with power  to extend from time to time.   Clause 52 of the Bill has been drafted  to  give  effect  to  this proposal.                            Buildings.   76.  We have felt some doubt  whether the various provisions of the Public Health Acts  relating  to  buildings  would  more con- veniently be reproduced in the present Bill or be combined in  a separate Bill  with provisions  relating to streets.   We  have come to  the conclusion that on  the whole the former  is the more con- venient  course, for the reason that in the  byelaw-making  powers conferred by  Section  157 of  the Act  of  1875 and what is more important in the codes of byelaws actually in operation throughout the country, the  structure  and materials of buildings  are  closely linked with drains, sewers and sanitary conveniences.   To  divorce these  two subjects by  dealing with them  in separate legislation would, we think, cause an  unnecessary disturbance in the  day-to- day routine of public  health administration.   We have accordingly reproduced  in Clauses 53 to 59 the provisions of the general public health law which  deal with  buildings other than those, such as the Public Health (Buildings in Streets) Act, 1888, which are concerned with buildings  specifically  in their relation to streets,  and have also added some further provisions based on clauses which  Parlia- ment has freely accepted in local Acts.                    House and Trade  Refuse.   77. Under Section  42 of the Act of 1875 every local  authority may, and, when required by an order of.the  Minister, must, under- take or contract for the removal of house refuse.  Under Section 48 of  the Act  of  1907 where that section  is in force if  a local authority are  required by the owner of premises to remove trade refuse, they are bound to  do so and the owner must pay  a  reason- able sum, to be settled in case of  dispute by a court of  summary jurisdiction.  If a question arises  as to what is  to be considered trade refuse, the question may be  decided by a court of  summary jurisdiction,  whose  decision is  final.  In connection with  these sections, a letter was addressed to us by  the Association of  Municipal  Corporations expressing  the viewthat it would be desirable that  the expressions &quot; house refuse &quot; and &quot; trade refuse &quot; should be clearly  defined.  In the corresponding  provisions of the  Public  Health  (London)Act, 1891, both these terms are  defined, but in spite  of  this andof a considerable amount of case  law on the subject (e.g., Londonand Provincial  Laundry  Company v.  Willesden  L.B.,  [1892]2  Q.B.,271;  St.  Martins  Vestry v.  Gordon,  [1891]  1  Q.B.61; Westminster Corporation v.  Gordon Hotels Ltd, [1906] ,, 2 K.B.39)there is  still considerable  difficulty in  determining  in  London
whether particular refuse falls into&apos; one category or the other.   the broad effect  of the London definitions  as  judicially  interpretedseems to be  that  in deciding  whether refuse  is to be  treated ashouse refuse the character rather than the origin of the refuse mustbe looked at.   The matter was considered by  a  Departmental  Gom-mittee on London Cleansing, who made  a Report  in 1930 (Cmd.3613).  In  paragraph 12 of this Report the Committee state  :     &quot;... the situation is complicated  by the decisions of the    Courts that the refuse of hotels and restaurants is mainly house    and not trade refuse.  We  are of opinion that payment at cost    should be made  for collecting the refuse arising from the carry-    ing on of any  trade or business,  except where it is collected    from small premises with  the  house refuse and is negligible    in quantity.   Regarding the matter from  this point of  view,    the  preferential treatment  accorded  to hotels and restaurants    in consequence  of the  judicial decisions  is  difficult  to defend.    We consider that they  should be  placed on the same footing    as other  businesses.&quot;  78.  We gave much consideration to this matter, and in particular to the question whether an attempt  should be made to draft a definition which would secure  that whatever the character of therefuse it should be treated as trade refuse, if it resulted from tradingor industrial  processes.  In this connection we considered various local Act definitions.  We arrived, however,  somewhat reluctantlyat the conclusion that none of the  various attempts at definitionto which our  attention was drawn is free from serious difficulty andthat, if  any alteration is to be  made in the existing law, it should probably be on more fundamental lines than would be justifiable inthe present Bill.   Accordingly, the terms  &quot; house refuse &quot; and&quot; trade refuse &quot; are used in Clauses  71 and 72 of the Bill, as theyare in the existing Acts, without definition.    References to reports and  certificates of specified officers.  79.  Throughout the sections  reproduced in this Part of the Billwe have found, in a great variety of  forms, references to reports orcertificates  to be given by a specified officer of the  local authority,usually the medical officer of health but sometimes  the surveyor orsanitary inspector, as  a condition precedent  to  the local authoritytaking action. Por examples, reference  may be made to Sections 16,36 and 38 of the Act  of 1875,  Section 22 of the Act of 1890, and sections 45, 46 and 49  of the Act of 1907.  In our view  it should in general be unnecessary in the present condition of  local government  to encumber the statute  book with provisions requiring  local authorities to act  on the advice of  theirown officers.   It may  fairly be  assumed that as responsible bodies they will seek  the appropriate  advice  before taking action.   This Part of  the draft Bill  accordingly omits these references except in Clauses  82, 83 and  84.   These clauses enable  a local authority to
take drastic  action for dealing with  verminous  premises,  articles and persons, and it is reasonable that these powers should not beput into operation except on a certificate of the responsible officer.                           PART III.         NUISANCES AND OFFENSIVE TRADES.  80. The task  of fitting  the  &quot; Nuisance &quot;  provisions  of thePublic Health Acts into the Bill has proved  a difficult one.  Inreading the Act of 1S75 one is struck by the fact that the sectionsdealing with  Nuisances  (Ss.  91-111)  substantially  overlap  other provisions  of the  Act,  and  that the  procedure  for  remedyingnuisances laid down in these sections differs in toto from the pro-cedure for dealing with  similar matters under other parts  of theAct.   Thus, under Section 91  (2) a drain which is so foul or insuch a state as to be a nuisance or injurious to- health may be dealtwith  by means of a notice calling upon the person in default toabate  the nuisance,  followed by proceedings before justices andan order of  justices  for abatement.    Under section 41  of thesame Act a precisely  similar state of affairs may be dealt with bythe  local authority calling  upon the  owner to do the necessarywork, doing it themselves on his default, and  recovering the costsummarily or as private improvement expenses, the owner having aright of  appeal to the  Minister under Section 268 of the Act as soonas the demand for expenses is made.  Apart from differences in many points of detail,  the major distinction between the two proceduresis that under the first, but not under the second, the local authority have no power, in the absence of an order of the justices, to takeactual  steps  to-  remedy  the  nuisance,  except where  the  personcausing  the nuisance cannot be  found.   This overlapping and  diversity of procedure is  due to historicalcauses.   The nuisance  provisions originated in the  NuisancesRemoval Act, 1846,  which was a temporary Act.  This measurepreceded the first general Public Health Act of 1848  and con- sequently at the date of its passing there was no general  system of public health authorities.   The  Act of  1846  was  enforced by town councils, trustees  or commissioners  for  drainage or  similar purposes, and the guardians of the poor, and it was probably owing to the diverse character of these enforcing authorities that Parlia- ment left it to the justices to direct executive action.   The secondNuisances Removal Act (the first permanent measure)  was passed in 1848, and it  is significant that the Act did  not apply where the  Public  Health Act, 1848, was  in force,  unless  the General Board of Health  so  directed.   This  was due to  the fact that the Public  Health Act,  1848, gave local boards of  health powers of dealing with many  of the offensive conditions dealt  with in the Nuisances  Removal  Acts without  invoking  the   aid  of justices,
powers  which were  largely reproduced in the Public  Health act of 1872 and the consolidating Act of 1875.  Meanwhile, however,for  reasons which are not apparent the Nuisances Removal Act,1855  (a  consolidating  and  amending  measure),  conferred thenuisance powers generally on public health  authorities, and these powers  are reproduced  in the nuisance provisions of  the Act  of1875.  Thus  the two streams of legislation became combined  ina single code  with a  consequent overlapping.  81. In  connection with Part  II  of  the Bill,  we have alreadyrecommended a uniform  procedure under which  a person who  is served with a notice requiring him to execute works  will have aright to appeal to a court of summary  jurisdiction.  This recom-mendation, if adopted, would substantially  reduce the  differencebetween the  procedure  under Part II and the nuisance  procedure under  Sections 91-111  of the Act of  1875, since in  either case before the person served with a notice can be  saddled  with anyexpense he has the  right to have the  whole issue between him and the  local  authority determined  by  a  court.    Por  thisreason,  and with the general object of shortening and simplifyingthe  law,  we  considered   whether   the   nuisance   proceduremight not be wholly abandoned and  replaced  by the  procedure under Part II of  the Bill.   With  some reluctance we have cometo the conclusion that this would involve  too drastic an  alterationof  the  law,  and in  particular of  the important provisions withregard to smoke nuisances contained in the recent Public Health(Smoke Abatement)  Act,  1926.   Another factor which has weighedwith us is the necessity for retaining the  right  of an  aggrievedperson  to institute  proceedings  (Section 93 of the Act of 1875).The procedure under Part II of the Bill is not  suitable for thispurpose.  A  further  provision which  it is important to retain  asregards some nuisances is the right of the local  authority to takeproceedings in respect  of nuisances outside  their district.  We have  accordingly reproduced  in  this Part of  the Bill the substance of  Sections  91-111, with  some alterations  in  detail  to which attention is called in the notes on clauses.                          PART IV.                     WATER SUPPLY.  82, The existing  law as regards the  supply  of  water by  localauthorities under  the Public Health  Acts is  to be found mainly in.Sections 51 to 70 of the Act of 1875, the Public Health (Water)Act, 1878, an Act specially directed to the supply of water in  rural areas, and the Supply of Water in Bulk  Act, 1934.  Section 57 ofthe Act of  1875 incorporates  thirty-eight  sections, of  the Water-works Clauses Act, 1847, and the  whole of the Waterworks Clauses
Act, 1863.  Thus, apart from  the short Act of 1934, the object ofwhich is to empower water  undertakers, whether local authorities or companies, to supply each other with water in bulk, the legisla-tion has remained substantially unaltered  for over 60 years,  and much  of it was originally passed nearly 90 years  ago.  It is not surprising, therefore, that a  number of amendments and additionalprovisions have become common in local  legislation  and, as  willbe  seen from the  notes  on  clauses,  some of  these have  been incorporated in the draft Bill.  83.  Much attention  has  been  directed  in recent years to thesubject of water  supply, and in 1923 the then  Minister of Healthestablished  an Advisory Committee  on Water.  This Committeehas  issued several  reports  which contain  a  large  number of recommendations, some directed to administrative action, others toamending  legislation.   Of the latter, one  of the most important,namely the conferment of  a  power on rural district  councils tocontribute from  the  district rate  towards the  cost of supplyingwater  to a contributory place within the district, has  been carried into effect by  Section 56 of the Local Government  Act, 1929 (nowSection 190 (4)  of the  Local Government Act, 1933).  Section 57of the Local Government Act, 1929, enables a part of the cost tobe spread over a still wider  area by means of a contribution fromthe county council.  84.  A  number of the recommendations in the  Second Beport ofthe Legislation  Sub-Committee of the Advisory  Committee relateto the amendment  of  the  Waterworks Clauses Acts.  Many ofthese  are of an uncontrovarsial  character, and  we considered whether  they might properly  be incorporated in  the draft  Bill.As, however,  the Bill  is  necessarily limited to water undertakerswho  are  local  authorities,  such an;  incorporation would cjreatedifferences between  the code  applying to these undertakers  andthat applying to statutory water companies.  This would be  lih-fortunate,  and we have accordingly been forced  to the conclusionthat these amendments must be left to a Bill dealing with water undertakers of both classes.  85. For somewhat similar reasons  we  have  come  to  the  con-clusion that the balance of convenience  lies in the  direction ofnot incorporating in  the  Bill  the Supply of Water in Bulk  Act,1934.  The Act deals both  with local  authorities  and with  otherwater undertakers, and  though it would be possible  to extract from-the Act  such portions  as relate to local authorities and to  leavethe remainder outstanding, we think  that  this course is likely to lead to difficulties.   We have,  accordingly, inserted in Clause  116a reference to the Act which will serve  as a pointer, and have left the Act untouched..
         Obligation of Owners  to secure Water Supply.  86. The  reproduction of the law  relating to the  obligation ofan owner of a  house to secure a supply  of water  gives rise tosome difficulty.  Section 62 of the  Act of  1875 provides,  in  effect, that, whereit appears to a local authority that any house within their districtis without  a proper supply of  water, and that such  a supply  canbe furnished at  a  cost not exceeding the authorised water rate inthe district, or if there is no- authorised rate at a cost not  exceeding2d.  a week, or at such other cost as  the Minister may  determineto be reasonable,  the authority shall  require the owner  to obtain a supply, and on his default  may  do the&apos; necessary work at hisexpense.  Section  8 of the  Public Health  (Water) Act,  1878,enables the Minister, if application is made to him  under Section62 of the  Act of 1875, to determine what is a reasonable costand  for  that  purpose to  fix a  general scale  of charges  for  thewhole or any part of the  district.  Under Section 3 of the Act of 1878, it is the duty of every rural district  council  to  see  that  every  occupied  dwelling-house  haswithin a reasonable distance an available and  sufficient  supply ofwholesome water; and, where it appears to them that any occupieddwelling-house has not such a supply within a reasonable distance,and  they are of opinion that such a  supply  can  be provided at areasonable  cost,  and that the expense of providing a supply oughtto be paid  by the owner, the authority may require  the owner to execute the necessary works, and on his default may themselvesdo the  work at his  expense.   &quot; Reasonable cost &quot; is  defined asbeing a  cost not  exceeding  a capital sum the interest  on whichat the rate of  5 per cent, per annum  would  amount to  2d.  perweek, or such other cost not  exceeding a capital sum the interestoil which at the rate of 5 per cent,  per annum would  amount to3d.  per  week,  as the Minister may  determine to  be reasonable.Where  two or  more houses  are concerned, joint  works may beprovided, with an apportionment of the expenses,  so long  as no greater cost would be occasioned thereby.  Sections 4  and  5  of the Act of  1878 provide for appeals  byowners against  these  requirements  and  against apportionmentsof expenses respectively.  S7. It is to be observed that while Section 62 of the Act of 1875,and  Section 3 of  the Act  of 1878, deal with substantially similarcases, the earlier section protects the owner of  a house by limitinghis obligation to secure  a supply of water to cases in which it canbe supplied at a reasonable annual charge, that is,  by reference to continuing cost, whereas Section 3 of the later Act imposes a  limitin terms of the capital cost of  the works..  The  difference in  thisrespect between the two  sections is  to some  extent obscured bythe  fact that in  the later section the  capital sum is  defined by
reference to a sum on which interest at  5 per cent, would amountto 2d. a week.   This method of denning the sum appears however to be purely fortuitous and the sum might more simply have been described  as  a sum  of  8 13s.  4d.  The reason why  in the act of 1875 a limiting factor was fixed  in  terms of continuing cost,but in the Act of 1878 in terms of capital cost, is no doubt thatin the earlier Act Parliament had in contemplation the linking ofthe house to a  piped water supply,  whereas in the later  it was concerned with  the digging  of  wells or the  execution of  similarworks.  88. The joint effect of the two  sections  is far from  clear,  andto reproduce them substantially  as they are in juxtaposition would create confusion.  Moreover, the procedure of Section 3 of the act of 1878 is cumbersome  and out-of-date, and the Advisory Com-mittee on Water  have  recommended  (Second  Report   of  theLegislation  Sub-Committee,  paragraph 190)  -that it  should beshortened and simplified, and further that  the limits of cost irn-posed by  the  Act should be raised so as to  correspond with thechange in the value of money.  89. We have  come  to the conclusion that  the proper course isto merge  the two codes  and to protect the  owner by placing  a limit  both on the capital cost  of  the works and on  the  annualcharges which  may  be  made  for  the supply  of water.    TheAdvisory Committee recommended  that the maximum capital cost should be fixed at  17  6s.  8d.  We consider that it  should beraised to  20 in view of the fall in the rate of  interest  which hasoccurred  since the date  of their Report : and we have provided,as under  Section 62 of the Act of  1875,  that  if the supply isprovided by water undertakers, the annual cost is not to exceed thewater charges prevailing  in the  district.  These provisions are to be found in Clauses  138 and 139.  The following other points  should  be noted in connection withthese clauses of the Bill :       (1)  The complicated  provisions of paragraphs  (2) and (3)    of Section 3 of the  Act  of  1878 with regard  to a first and    second notice  are omitted  in accordance  with the  recom-    mendations  of the Advisory  Committee,  and replaced  by the    ordinary  procedure of a notice  requiring  the owner to  do the    necessary  work, with power for the authority (subject to the&apos;    owner&apos;s right of appeal)  to do  the work  at his expense in    case  of his default.      (2)  Paragraph  (5)  of Section 3  of the Act of 1878 provides    that  where the owners of two or more houses have failed to    execute  the  necessary works the authority may,  if satisfied    that  no  greater expense would  be occasioned thereby,  execute    works for the joint supply of water to the houses and apportion    the expenses.  This  provision  sufficiently meets the  case in    which, if separate works were executed  for each  house,  the
expense  in each  case  would  not be  more  than reasonable.Our attention was, however, drawn to the fact that cases occur in which, if separate works were  executed, the expense wouldbe  more than reasonable and therefore  outside the limits ofthe section, as regards some or all of the  owners, but wherethe execution of  joint  works  would  effect  so substantial  a.saving that the cost, if fairly apportioned amongst the owners,would in no case  exceed  20  per house.   Clause 138  (2)  hasbeen  inserted to meet this type of case.  (3)  A  clause  is commonly  allowed  in local Acts enabling the local authority to make a requisition  for a supply of waterfrom  statutory undertakers  under Section 35  of  the  Water-works Clauses Act,  1847,  on behalf of owners and occupiers of premises.   A provision on these  lines has been included in sub-section (4) of  Clause 138, as one of the methods by whicha local authority can enforce a  supply.     Supply  within the limits  of  other  water undertakers.  90.  Clauses 113, 116 (2)  and 117 deal with the conditions underwhich a local authority may supply water within the limits of supplyof other statutory undertakers.   Section 52 of the Act of 1875  pro-hibits such supply  if and  so  long as the undertakers  are &quot;  able and willing &quot; to supply water proper and sufficient for  all  reason-able purposes for which it  is required by the local authority;  anddisputes on this point are to be settled by arbitration.  It  seems  thatthe undertakers do not  show  themselves  unable and  unwilling tosupply, unless they fail to comply  with a requisition made underSection  35 of the Waterworks Clauses Act,  1847, as incorporated in their Act.  This  section  requires undertakers to lay down mainsand provide a supply on a requisition of such number of occupiersand owners of  property that  the annual water rates payable bythem  will be not less than one-tenth part (frequently amended in local  Acts to one-eighth part)  of  the expense  of  providing  andlaying the mains, if the occupiers or  owners bind themselves totake the supply for three years at least.  Section 52 of the Act of 1875  has given rise to considerabledifficulty.   It may  well be, for example, that the expense whichthe undertakers would incur in  complying with  such  a  requisitionwould be  much greater  than  the cost of a  local supply providedby the local authority.  Moreover,  in little-developed  areas, whichmay nevertheless be urgently in need of water, sparsity of  popula-tion  may  make it impossible  to  satisfy  the  conditions for arequisition.  The point  is  discussed in paragraph 177 of the Second Reportof the Legislative  Sub-Committee  of  the Advisory Committee onWater and their  recommendation, which  was  endorsed  by the
full  Committee,  is  that the  Minister should be empowered  tomake an order removing the area in question from  the limits ofsupply of the undertakers.  91. We  considered whether we should  recommend  this somc-what drastic amendment of the law, but we came to the conclusionthat it  would be preferable to follow  more closely the procedure which  Parliament has  frequently adopted in  local Acts.   Underthis  procedure undertakers  may  be empowered  by  order  of  theMinister to furnish a supply in an area which is  within the limits of some other undertakers,  but  is not in  fact being supplied  bythem,  with the consent  of  the  latter undertakers.  But  consentmust not be unreasonably refused, and there  is  a right of appealto the  Minister on the question of the reasonableness of a refusal.This provision is  usually accompanied by a further provision tothe effect -that if at any time the original undertakers are  able and willing to supply and give notice to that effect, the order shall cease to operate on  repayment by them of the expenses incurred by the  other  undertakers in affording the interim supply.  the precedents  in local  legislation all relate to such  a  supply being given by undertakers outside their district,  but if  the principleof the  clause is sound,  we  see no reason why it  should not applyto an area within the district.  Clauses 116 (2) and 117 of the Bill,which take the place of Section 52 have been drafted accordingly.  The ordinary case dealt with in the local Acts,  of supply  outsidethe district, is provided for in Clause 113.            Provisions repealed without  re-enactment.  92. We  may call  attention to the&apos; following  sections of the  act of 1S75 relating to the supply of water which  are not reproduced in the Bill.  Section 66 is left outstanding, since, although it forms  one ofthe water clauses in the  Act of 1875, it appears  more appropriate to a Bill dealing  with the prevention of fire.  Section  67  enables the Corporations of  Oxford  and  Cambridgeto supply water to Colleges and Plalls on terms to be  agreed.  Webelieve  that the  section  owes its existence  to the fact when itwas  originally enacted in 1848 that buildings divided into  sets ofchambers were uncommon, and it was thought  that in the  absenceof the section it would be necessary to demand water rates from the occupiers of individual chambers.  We understand  that the Corpora-tion  of Oxford, who  supply water in the borough, no  longer attachany importance to the section, and that agreements have not in fact been made under it, the Colleges being  supplied with water bymeter.   The Corporation of Cambridge do not supply  water,  the borough  being supplied  by other water  undertakers,  and as itappears highly improbable that the Corporation would. themselvesbecome  undertakers without obtaining  Parliamentary powers,
the  prospect  of  the   section  ever  being  of  value  in  thattown is remote.  Section 37 of the Act of 1875 provides that if any contract orenactment requires a supply of water to be furnished to a water-closet in a-house, and  if an earth-closet is,  with the approval ofthe local  authority, in use  in  the  house, the authority may  onagreed terms relieve the person  required to provide the supply ofIris obligation.   We have not succeeded  in tracing any  case inwhich  this  section has been used,  and we are satisfied  that atthe present day it may be regarded as obsolete.                           PART V.  PREVENTION, NOTIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF                          DISEASE.  93.  The provisions reproduced  in  this Part of the  Bill are takenin the main from the Public Health  Acts of 1875,  1890, 1896, 1907,1913 and  1925, the Infectious Disease  (Notification) Acts of 1889and 1899, and the Infectious Disease (Prevention) Act, 1890.             Definition of Infectious  Disease, etc.  94.  One of the principal difficulties in framing this Part of theBill has been the use, throughout the statutes which it reproduces,of a large number of expressions  denoting infectious disease.  thus the Act of 1875 uses the terms  &quot; infectious  disease &quot;,  &quot; fever orother infectious disease  &quot;,  &quot; infectious  disorder &quot;, &quot; dangerous  in-fectious disorder &quot; and  &quot; dangerous  infectious disease &quot;, all with-out definition.  One or  more of  these expressions occur  in  several of the  other Acts without definition.   The Customs  ConsolidationAct, 1876, introduces yet  another term, also undefined, &quot; highlyinfectious distemper &quot;.   In  the  Infectious  Disease  (Notification)Act, 1889, the expression &quot; infectious disease &quot;  is defined as mean-ing &quot; any of the following diseases,  namely  smallpox, cholera,diphtheria, membranous croup,  erysipelas, the  disease  known asscarlatina or scarlet fever,  and  the fevers known  by any  of thefollowing  names : typhus,  typhoid, enteric, relapsing,  continuedor puerperal &quot; ; and the expression also  includes, as respects  any-particular borough or district, any infectious disease to  which the Act has been applied by an order made by the  local authority  and confirmed by the Minister.  The Infectious  Disease (Prevention) Act, 1890, provides  that the Act is to apply to the diseases specific- ally mentioned in the Act of 1889 &quot;and may be applied to any other infections disease in the same manner as that Act (i.e.,  the Act of 1889) may be  applied to such disease.&quot;   The  Isolation Hospitals Act, 1893, similarly provides that the  term &quot; infectious disease &quot; !s to have the same meaning as  in  the Act of 1889, but enables a county council  to apply the Act  to  other infections diseases.  The
Act of 1907 defines  the term as meaning any infectious disease towhich the Act of 1889 for the time being applies within the boroughor district of the local authority.   Section 60 of the Act of 1925 pro-vides that for the purposes of Sections 57, 58 and 59 of that Act theexpression &quot; dangerous infectious disease &quot;  means any  infectiousdisease  named in Section 6  of  the  Act of 1889, but enables theMinister  of Health to  make  orders  declaring  other  infectious diseases  to be dangerous infectious  diseases  for any  of  those purposes.  The position is further complicated by the  fact  that the LocalGovernment Board and Minister of Health have from time to timemade regulations under Section 130 of the Act of  1875, of whichthe Public Health  (Tuberculosis)  Regulations are the best known,requiring various diseases not  specified in  the Act of 1889 to be notified under  a procedure set out in the regulations.  The regula-tions do hot have the  effect  of  bringing these diseases within thescope of  the  Act  of 1889  and  technically they  do not  becomenotifiable diseases under  that Act.  95. It would be impossible to leave this variety of language in aBill designed to simplify  and clarify the law, and we have come tothe  conclusion that a substantial simplification  can be effected,without any radical or controversial amendment, by using through-out  the  Bill  two  expressions  only,  namely: (1)  &quot;infectiousdisease  &quot;, which, as under the Act of 1875, is left undefined, and(.2) &quot; notifiable disease &quot; which  is defined (Clause 332) as meaningthe particular  diseases specified  in the  Act  of 1889, and  any otherdisease   which  is   for the  time being  compulsorily  notifiableunder those provisions of the Bill which reproduce  Section 7 of theAct of 1889.   Diseases such  as  tuberculosis, for  the notification ofwhich provision  may be  made by regulations, will remain on thesame footing as before, but Clause 143 (2)  provides that the regu-lations  may,  so  far as is expedient,  apply to  them any of theprovisions of Part V of the Act  relating to notifiable diseases.                     Notification of Diseases.   96. The  Infectious  Disease  (Notification)  Act, 1889, providesthat the diseases  mentioned in paragraph 94 above shall be notifiablethroughout the country.   We have had the advantage of the views of the technical advisersof the Ministry of Health on the question  whether this  list needsrevision.   We understand that continued fever is an old term in-tended to include undiagnosed cases of typhoid, paratyphoid, typhusand other long continued pyrexias which might conceivably be ofepidemiological importance, but that it has little or no significanceto-day, and might, with advantage, be omitted.   97. Puerperal fever falls within  the wider class of cases known aspuerperal  pyrexia,   and  required  to  be  notified   by regulations made  by  the  Minister  in  1926  (S.R.  &amp;  O., 1926,  No.  972),
Iti. view of the inclusion of puerperal fever  in the Act of 1889, theregulations were drafted so as  to apply to  all cases of febrile con-dition occurring at  childbirth except those required to be notifiedas puerperal  fever under the Act.  For administrative simplicity, aswell as on medical grounds, it  would be convenient that puerperalfever should  be omitted from the statutory  list, so that  all cases ofpuerperal pyrexia can be brought within the fuller requirements ofthe regulations.   The  words   &quot; continued or  puerperal &quot;  have accordingly  been  omitted  from  the  definition  of   &quot; notifiabledisease &quot; in Clause 332.                     Local Act Provisions.  98.  There  are few subjects as respects which the general law hasbeen extended and amplified by local Acts  more freely  than it hasas respects infectious  disease.   We considered whether it would bedesirable to  insert a number of clauses dealing  with  such matters as the exclusion of children from places of  public entertainment orfrom Sunday Schools.   We came  to the conclusion, however, thatthese  provisions raise medical  issues on  which,  without hearingexpert evidence, we are not qualified to express an opinion and that, if there is a  case for strengthening the law, the necessary changes should be effected by separate amending legislation,                           PAST VI.          HOSPITALS,  NURSING  HOMES, ETC.                       Isolation Hospitals.  99.  This Part of the Bill reproduces the sections of the Public  Health  Acts of 1875,  1907 and  1925, relating to hospitals, the  Nursing Homes Registration  Act, 1927,  and  certain provisions  of the Local Government  Act, 1929.  The chief difficulty which the consolidation  of the law on this  matter presents is the treatment of the Isolation Hospitals  Acts,  1893  and 1901.  The first of  these Acts, which originated in a  Private Member&apos;s Bill, was passed at a time  when the  problem  of making proper provision for  the isolation and treatment of small-  pox  was attracting  much public attention; and its  main  object  was to enable the newly constituted county councils to play a part  in the establishment  of isolation hospitals  in their counties.  The  ict  provides  for the establishment  of  hospitals  governed  by  isolation hospital committees consisting either :        (a) of representatives of the county council; or       (b) of representatives of the county council and of the county    district  councils; or       (c) of representatives of the county  district councils only.   The procedure laid down in  the Act for the constitution of com-   mttees is cumbersome.  The  Act  has, however, been used on a
fairly substantial scale, and 70 isolation  hospital committees areat present in existence,  four of these  consisting wholly  of  repre-sentatives of county councils.  The Act of 1893 contains 26,  andthe amending  Act of  1901 9  sections.  Both  Acts deal in great detail with matters which it would now be regarded as unnecessary to mention, e.g., they empower an isolation hospital committee notonly to provide buildings, but to acquire  &quot; tents,  wooden housesor other places for the reception of patients,&quot;  and require that every hospital  shall  &quot; so far as practicable  be connected to the telegraph system.&quot;   Other provisions of the  Act of 1893, such asthe power to provide ambulances (Section 13)  and to train nurses(Section 15) are  within the powers of local authorities under other legislation  reproduced  in  the Bill.   100.  Since  1901  the position  of  county councils  in  regard tohospitals, has been radically  altered,  first  by  the fact that countycouncils are empowered  by the Local  Government Act, 1929, toprovide hospitals themselves,  and secondly  by  the provision inSection 63 of the same Act requiring  every county council to make ja  scheme for the provision of hospitals for  the treatment  of in-fectious disease.   Further by Clause 6 of the  draft Bill  a countycouncil may become  a  constituent  member of a joint  hospitalboard and by Clanse 8 it may combine with county borough councilsfor hospital purposes.  For these reasons there  can be  no. doubtthat as  regards the future, the machinery of the Isolation HospitalsActs  enabling  county councils to combine  with  county district councils for the provision  of isolation  hospitals will be unnecessary.Moreover,  we understand that the existence  of committees underthese Acts  has  created some  embarrassment  in  the formulation of schemes under Section  63 of the Act of  1929, since it is doubtfulwhether such schemes  can properly impose duties on these isolationhospital committees.   In these circumstances  four courses are possible :        (a) to incorporate the Isolation Hospitals Acts  as they standl    in  this Part of the  Bill, a course which would  involve arj    addition of some  ten pages;       (b) to leave the Acts outstanding on the ground  that theirl    structure and language are  so  different  from  those of  tier    Public  Health Acts  that they  form an  excrescence  wirier!    cannot usefully be brought into  the main  code;       (c) to repeal them as regards the  constitution of isolatior    hospital committees  in the future, with  a suitable saving fo    existing committees  (this would  involve  leaving the Acts outj    standing on the Statute Book);       (d) to repeal them without re-enactment,  after a  short inj    terval, and to provide a procedure for converting in the intervif    the existing  committees into joint hospital boards under Part j
   of the Bill, or, in the few cases in which the committees consist   of county  council representatives only, for dissolving the com-   mittees and transferring the hospitals to the county councils. We  recommend  the adoption of the last of these courses andare satisfied that while it will secure a very substantial  simplification-tion of the law, nothing of any value will  be lost by the repeal  ofthese Acts.  Accordingly, following  the principle adopted by Par-liament in Section  293 of  the Local  Government Act,  1933, wehave provided  in Clause 307 that the Minister should be required,within two years from the commencement of the Bill, to make orders  to give effect to this proposal.Recovery  of Expenses of Maintenance of Patient in Hospital. 101. Section 132 of the Act of 1875 provides that the expense  ofmaintaining in any hospital whether for infectious  or  for  otherdiseases a patient  who is  not a pauper  is  to be  a debt  fromthe patient to  the. local authority,  and may be recovered within six months of the  date of  his discharge  from the  hospital,  or if he dies therein,  within six  months from the date  of his death.In order  to remove doubts  which had arisen, Section  60 of thePublic Health  Acts Amendment Act, 1907, provided that nothing in the  earlier section should require  the local authority to recoverthe cost  of maintenance from a patient who was not  a pauper,where  they had satisfied themselves  that the  circumstances of thecase were such as to justify the remission of the debt.  102. Section 16  of  the ;Local Government Act, 1929, draws  a listinctioD between persons  who become  inmates of institutions   the purpose of receiving  treatment for infectious disease  and those who become  inmates  for other purposes.  As regards in-  tious patients, the  section made no alteration in  the  law. As   ards non-infectious  patients, it  imposed  a duty  on  all  local   horities (including  county councils) to recover the expenses  of  amteiiance  from  the patient or  from any  person  legally liable  maintain him.  This duty  is, however, subject to  the  qualifica-  n that if the authority are  satisfied that the persons from whom   expenses are  recoverable cannot reasonably be required to pay   whole, they are to recover such  part,  if any, of  the expenses  the  patient or his relatives  are able to pay.   The term  &quot; institu-  ion &quot;  is  defined in Section 16 of the  Local Government Act, 1929,   including hospitals, maternity homes and other institutions pro-  ifel under the Public Health Acts, the Local  Government Acts  id the Maternity and Child  Welfare Act,  1918.   103. We feel no doubt that, while the distinction drawn by the   t of 1929  between  infectious and non-infectious patients must   maintained, the  various provisions of  the  existing law ought,  &quot;the sake of clarity, to be  combined in a single clause, but this
assimilation of the provisions of the Acts of 1875 and 1929 intro-duces  some  slight amendments  of the  law to&apos;  which  attention should be called :        (a) Clause 184 for the first  time confers on county councils a    power (which local authorities have had since 1875), but not    a duty, to recover the cost of maintenance in cases of infectious    disease.  It is clearly anomalous that the question whether the    patient should be maintained  at public expense without a right    of recovery from him or his relatives should  depend on whether    the hospital is maintained by one type of local authority or by    another.       (b) Under the existing law, which is  referred to in detail    in the note on Clause  197, a reasonable charge may be made    for the use of an ambulance in conveying a person on discharge    from a hospital  or in  conveying  a sick  person not suffering    from infectious disease.  No provision is made for the recovery    of expenses in other cases.  The question of  charging  for the    cost  of  removal  by  ambulance whether  to or from hospital    ought in our view to- be on the  same footing as that of    charging for maintenance in  hospital, and we have secured    this   by   including removal   charges  in  the  definition  of    &apos;&apos;  expenses &apos;&apos; in Clause 184 (2)  (b).       (c) The clause similarly confers on local  authorities (includ-    ing county councils)  a  power,  but  not  a  duty,  to recover the    cost  of  maintaining an infectious  patient  not  only  from the    patient but from his relatives.  Here again, a situation under    which in the case of non-infectious disease the relatives may be    charged, but not  in the case of an infectious disease, appears to    have no justification.   The removal of anomalies such as  these    was  recommended by  the Committee  on  Local  Expenditure    (Report  Cmd. 4200, paragraph 191).       (d) The clause  imports two  features of the Act of 1875-8    right to  recover  from  the estate in the event  of the  patient    dying in  hospital, and a short time limit for recovery.  Section    16 of the Act of 1929 is narrower in that it provides only for    recovery from  the patient or from  a person legally liable to    maintain, but is less restricted in  that it makes  no reference    to  a time  limit,  although  in   a  dissenting  judgment  in    Allen v. Waters and Go.  (1934),  152 L.T. 182,  Goddard J,    expressed the view that a time  limit of six months does ii    fact  apply.  Instead of six months, as provided in  the Ad    of 1875, the Bill  proposes a  limit of twelve months, andji    provides  for recovery from the estate of a person who has did    after leaving the  hospital as well as from the estate of a perse    whose death occurred in hospital.                          Laboratories.  104. There is  no  statutory provision  expressly  enabling  l&quot;c(authorities to provide a laboratory for  general purposes, but undc
Section 10 of the Milk and Dairies  (Consolidation)  Act, 1915, alocal authority may  &quot; provide,  or arrange for the  provision  of,bacteriological or other examination of  milk.&quot;  Moreover,  regula-tions made under Section 130 of  the Public Health Act, 1875, withrespect to the treatment of diseases have authorised - authorities toprovide facilities, including pathological facilities,   necessary  forthe diagnosis and treatment  of  certain diseases,  e.g., tuberculosis-losis,  cerebro-spinal-spinal fever,, venereal disease, puerperal fever,  etc.We understand  that  applications by local authorities for sanction to raise a loan for the provision,of a laboratory have  in some casesbeen granted by the  Ministry  of Health  on the principle that an authority  charged with specific functions which necessitate  laboratory-tory work have  an implied power to provide  a laboratory  for thepurpose,  but this  point  is  not entirely  free  from  doubt.    we accordingly  recommend that  local authorities  (including  countycouncils)  should  be given express  power to provide  a  laboratoryfor the diagnosis and treatment  of diseases  and for the making ofbacteriological and other  examinations  and  Clause  196  has been inserted for this purpose.                          PART VII.NOTIFICATION  OF BIRTHS;  MATEENITY  AND CHILD        WELFARE, AND CHILD LIFE PROTECTION.  105.  This part of the Bill re-enacts the  Notification of  BirthsActs of 1907 and 1915, the Maternity and Child Welfare Act, 1918,and Part I of the Children Act, 1908, as amended by the children and Young Persons Act, ,1932.  It also  includes certain sectionsof the Local Government Act, 1929.      Local authorities  for the purposes  of  these  services.  106.  The Notification  of Births Act, 1907, could be adopted  byborough and district councils and by county councils, with a power for the Minister on application to transfer the  functions from one authority to another.   The Act of  1915  which applied the act of 1907 to the whole country provided that where the earlier Act hadnot already been adopted by the county council,  it should fake effect as if it had been adopted by the,borough or district council.  Underthe Children Act, 1908,  Boards of  Guardians were responsible forinfant life protection.   The Maternity and Child Welfare Act, 1918,provided that any local authority within the meaning of the Notifica-tion of Births Act, .1907, might make arrangements under.the Act.  Before the Local Government Act, 1929, it was therefore possiblein-any district for the notifications  made under the Notification of.Births  Acts to  be sent,  to a  different authority  from that  whichactually provided health  visitors and the other  services  relating to.maternity and child  welfare under the Act of 1918, while the respon-sibility for  infant life protection was nowhere in the hands  of the   33141                                                     c
authority undertaking other child welfare services.  It was also pos-sible under the Act of 1918 for a county district council to establishmaternity. and child welfare services, notwithstanding that services under the Act were already provided in the district  by the countycouncil  and vice versa, although in practice the requirement thatarrangements should be sanctioned by the Ministry was sufficientto prevent serious duplication.  The Act  of 1929  transferred the  responsibility for infant lifeprotection to  the councils-of  counties  and county boroughs, exceptthat,  if a county district  council had established a  maternity and child  welfare  committee, the  functions in that district  were to be discharged by the county  district council instead of  by the countycouncil.  The Act  also enabled  the Minister of his own motion totransfer  the  powers of the  Notification of  Births  Act from thedistrict  council to  the county council, or vice  versa (Section 61),and further enabled him,  on  application, to  transfer the responsi-bility for services  under  the Act of  1918 to the local educationauthority for  elementary education- (Section  60).  We understandthat, as a result of an order made under Section 61 in 1930 affecting266 districts,  together with several subsequent orders, there is nowno area  in  which the responsibility  for health  visiting  under the notification  of Births  Act,   1907,  is not  in  the  hands  of theauthority also responsible  for the principal other services under theAct of 1918,  and that, with  minor exceptions in a  few areas, the maternity and child welfare  services  are administered by a singleauthority in each borough or district.  Thus in substance the three services notification  of  births,  maternity and  child  welfare andinfant life protection are now in every case in the same hands.  107. The Bill is accordingly drafted on the lines of defining thelocal authority for the purposes of this Part, that is to say, for all three services,  as  being  the authority which  administered  these services  when the  Act became law,  with a power for the Minister(reproduced from Section 60 of  the LocahGovernment Act, 1929),on representations made to him, to  transfer these services  to theauthority responsible in the area for elementary education.  108. The Bill thus ensures that in any  area  only one authority shall  be responsible for these services, and it will bring to an endsuch  duplication as still remains.  Further, the area of charge for expenses incurred by a county  council will be the area for whichthe county council are the  authority, excluding  autonomous dis-tricts; and  the proviso to  Section 3 of the Act of 1918 with regardto the levy of  such expenses as expenses for general county purposeswith  a  refund to district councils  providing a similar  service hasbeen  omitted  as unnecessary.  There is no object  in the countyprecepts for  amounts of the  size now required for these servicesbeing first  levied by the county council on autonomous  districts and then refunded, and Clause 202 of the Bill therefore provides thatin a county containing autonomous districts  these expenses of thecounty council shall be expenses for special county purposes.
                         PART  VIII.    BATHS,  WASHHOUSES AND  BATHING  PLACES.  109.  This Part which consists of 13 clauses, reproduces the Bathsand Washhouses Acts of 1846, 1847, 1878, 1882 and 1899, togetherwith  some provisions  of  the   Public  Health  Acts  of  1875,1907 and 1925.  The number of sections which the Part is intendedto replace is 68, and it will  be seen that a very substantial curtail-ment and simplification has  been effected.  110.  The Baths and Washhouses Acts are &quot; adoptive &quot;.  Underthe Act of 1846 adoption was effected by the council of a boroughor by the vestry of a parish not within a borough. Where adoptiontook place, the Act was carried  into  effect in  a borough by  the borough council and elsewhere by commissioners appointed by  thevestry under the terms of the Act. Section 10 of the Act of 1875,transferred the power of adoption in urban districts from vestriesto urban district  councils and made these councils  responsible forcarrying out the Act.  In the case of a rural parish a similar transferwas  effected by the Local Government Act, 1894, from the vestryto the parish meeting, and  if the parish  had a  parish council  thelatter were made responsible for carrying the Act  into effect.  Thus,the only areas  in which commissioners may still be necessary  arethe small rural  parishes without parish councils.   In  fact, the Bathsand Washhouses Acts are not in force in any of  these parishes andno commissioners exist.  111.  The provision of baths  and   washhouses  was  originallyenvisaged as a mainly urban problem.   The situation has now been altered by  the  increasing popularity of open-air swimming baths.We understand that a number of rural district councils have been anxious to provide open-air baths in  and as part  of their recreation grounds, and that the Ministry of Health, relying on the authority ofA.G. v.  Sunderland Corporation (1876)  2 Ch. D. 634, have acceptedthe view that such baths can be provided as conducive to- the betterenjoyment of  the recreation ground.   It is clearly  unsatisfactorythat the  power to provide a swimming bath  should  depend on its being an adjunct  of a recreation ground, and apart from this pointwe understand  that there are difficulties connected with the powerto charge fees.   In our opinion  a substantial simplification of this branch of the- law  can  and should  be effected  by  abolishing  thesystem of adoption and  of  ad  hoc- commissioners,  and by simplyempowering a  borough,  urban or rural district council to providebaths, washhouses&apos; and  bathing  places.  We  suggest  also that  aparish council  should be given concurrent  powers.   It is not, wethink, necessary to make specific provision for the  case of a ruralparish without a council.  The needs  of  these small parishes  canbe met by action on the part of the rural district council who could,if it were thought convenient, appoint a parochial committee for thepurpose under  Section 87  of the Local Government  Act,  1933.   swui                                                    c 2
Alternatively, it would be possible for the county council to make anorder under Section 273 of that Act conferring on a parish meeting a power to provide baths, etc., and the latter under Section 90 couldappoint a committee to make the necessary arrangements.            Provisions repealed without re-enactment.  112. In addition to the  simplification effected by the abolition ofcommissioners, we are satisfied that a number of the  provisions ofthe earlier Acts might properly be repealed without re-enactmentas being  unnecessary or obsolete.  Examples of these are Section 33of the Act of. 1846, which  enacts that the. general management and regulation of baths, etc., provided under the Act is to be vested inthe baths authority,  and Section 4 of the same Act which requires the authority to  keep a  separate .Public Baths  and  WashhousesAccount.  Again, Section 36 of the same Act, as amended by section of the  Act of 1847,  provides in  effect that  the  number of bathsand  washing tubs for the working-classes is not  to  be  less thantwice the number of baths or washing tubs &quot; of any higher class &quot;.We understand that  the interpretation of these provisions formerlygave rise to a good deal of doubt and difficulty,  and that they wererepealed  in  London by Section 62 of  the London County  Council(General Powers)  Act, 1930.  It  also  appears that washing tubsare no longer to be found in modern washhouses.  We have accord-ingly omitted these provisions as  unnecessary.                           PART  IX.               COMMON  LODGING-HOUSES.  113. The principal provisions, reproduced  in this Part of the bill are to be found in &quot;Sections 76 to 89 of the Act of  1875, Sections 69to 75 of the Act of  1907, and Sections 58,  59 and 60 of the act of 1925.  114. The first question  which presented itself to us was whetherthe  term &quot; common lodging-house &quot;  should be  defined.  A longhistory attaches to this.  By&apos;Section 116 of the Towns Improve-ment Clauses Act, 1847,  every house is deemed  a public lodging-house &quot;  in  which persons are harboured or  lodged for hire for asingle&apos; night, or for  less than a week at  one time, or any part ofwhich is let for any term  less than a week.&quot;   The Common Lodg-ing-Houses Acts of 1851 and 1853 provided for the registration ofcommon lodging-houses but did not: define  the term.   These.Actswere extended to Ireland by the Common Lodging-Houses (Ireland)Act, 1860, Section 3 of which defined  the term &quot; common lodging;house &quot;  as  meaning &quot; a house&apos;in which persons are  harboured orlodged for hire for a single night, or for less than a week  at a time,or any part of  which is4et for any term less than a week.&quot; TheEnglish  Acts of 1851 and 1853 were&apos; amended by the Sanitary Act,
1866, and the Sanitary Law  Amendment Act, 1874, but no defi-nition of the term &quot; common lodging-house &quot;  was included.  ThePublic Health Act, 1875, reproduced the provisions of the Acts  of1851, 1853, 1866  and 1874, and  repealed  them  except  in  so faras they related to the Metropolitan Police District.   Again, how-ever, no definition of the term was given. 115. In 1853 the Law Officers of the Crown  (Sir A. E.  Cockburnand  Sir W. P. Wood) advised as follows on the Act of 1851 :       &quot; It may be difficult to give a precise definition of the term    &apos; common  lodging-house,&apos; but  looking to the preamble and    general provisions of the Act it appears to  us  to have reference    to that class&apos; of lodging-house in which persons of the  poorer    class are received for short periods  and,  though strangers  to    one another, are allowed to inhabit  one  common room.  We    are  of opinion that  it does  not include  hotels, inns,  public    houses, or lodgings let to the  upper  and middle classes.&quot; They later advised in the following terms :      &quot; Our obvious intention was  to  distinguish  lodgers pro-    miscuously brought together&apos; from&apos; members  of one  family  or    household.   We are of opinion that the period of letting is un-    important  in  determining whether  a  common  lodging-house    comes under the  Act now in question.&quot; 116. The meaning of  the term has been discussed in several judg-ments.   It is unnecessary to refer in detail  to the&apos;&apos; earlier  cases,hangdon  v.  Broadbent (1877), 42 J.P. 56;   Logsdon  v.  Booth[1900]  1 Q.B. 401;  Logsdon v. Trotter  [1900] 1  Q.B. 617; but itmay be mentioned that in the course of  his judgment in the last-mentioned case, Bucknill J.  expressed  the&apos;1 view  that the  Legis-lature  had acted  very  wisely in  omitting any  definition  of theexpression &quot; common lodging-house.&quot;  A curious  situation arose  inthe case of Parker v. Talbot, [1905]  2  Ch. 643.   This case dealtnth a charitable institution in which &quot;  deserving destitute poor &quot;were received without  charge.  The  case wont  to  the  Court  ofAppeal,  and when the Court were about to deliver a reservedjudgment,  their attention was called to  Section 3 of the CommonLodging-Houses  (Ireland) Act, 1860,  referred to above.    After farther  argument the  Court  held that the   definition in Sec- lion 3 applied equally to  the interpretation of  the English Acts  of 1851 and 1853, and maintained this view notwithstanding the fact that their attention was drawn to the subsequent repeal of the Irish let of 1860 by the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878.  In London County Council v.  Hankins [1914],  1 K.B. 490, i was  held that in order to constitute  a  common  lodging-house here must be community of accommodation for either sleeping  or sting.   &quot; In my opinion,&quot; said Atkin J., &quot; the law as to the  mean- Jg  of  the expression   &apos; common lodging-house  &apos;  was  definitely ftled  in Logsdon v.  Booth and Logsdon v. Trotter,  in  which1  33H1                                                   C 3
the Court adopted  the  definition given by  the Law Officers.  Theeffect of Parker v. Talbot was not to displace that definition butonly to add to it two more terms;  first it adds the term that thelodgings are to be lodgings for hire, and secondly it  defines the short period mentioned in the Law  Officers&apos;  opinion  as  being asingle night or less than a week.&quot;  Finally, in  Daley v. Lees,  [1926]  1  E.B.  40, it was held thatthe decision in Parker v. Talbot applies not only to London wherethe Common  Lodging-Houses Acts,  1851 and 1853, are  still inforce, but also to places outside London in which the&apos; Public HealthAct, 1875, is in force.  Lord Hewart C.J., began his judgment inthis case by saying that the  case &quot; raises a  question of no  littlepublic importance,  a question which may be thought worthy of theattention of the Legislature.&quot;  117.  We have come  to  the conclusion that  the  advantage of a statutory definition based on  the law as  declared in these cases will probably  outweigh the disadvantages,  and we are  fortified inthis view by  the fact that Parliament  has inserted a  number ofdefinitions in  local  Acts.   The definition inserted in Clause 234 ofthe Bill has been framed accordingly, but  it should be noted thatit contains no reference to the lodgings being &quot; for hire.&quot;   the omission of  this reference accords with  local Acts, and it  appearsto us to be  reasonable that lodging-houses intended for the recep-tion  of  persons of  this  class   should be liable to registration and inspection whether or not  any charge is made to the inmates.            Provisions repealed without re-enactment.  118.  It may be convenient  to refer here to  certain provisions ofthe Act of 1875, which the draft Bill repeals without re-enactment.  (1)  Section  90 of that Act enables a local authority to make bye-laws with regard&apos; to  various  matters in respect of houses let inlodgings or  occupied  by members of more than one family.  Thesection  (which was extended by Section 8 of the Housing of theWorking  Classes   Act,  1885) was  substantially  re-enacted bySection 26 of  the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1919, nowreplaced by  Sections 6 and 7 of the Housing Act,  1925.  These two sections have  now been amended  and  their  scope  extended bysection  68 of  the Housing Act, 1935.  Except in two respects thepowers conferred by these provisions of the Housing Acts are more comprehensive than those of  Section 90  of the  Act of 1875 andvirtually supersede  them.  The exceptions  are as follows :        (a) the reference in  Section 90  (6)  to the giving of notice    and the taking of precautions in case of any infectious disease    is reproduced in the Act of 1925 only  as regards London;       (b) Section  6  of  the  Act  of 1925 is limited  to houses     &quot;  intended or used  for occupation by the  working-classes &quot;
  As regards (a), byelaws  on this matter have been  rendered un-necessary by the Acts dealing with the notification  of infectiousdisease,  now reproduced in  Part V of the Bill.   As  to  (b), weunderstand  that in practice the Department &apos;s Model Byelaws underSection 90 have always been  limited to houses of the working classtype.  (See  the prefatory Memorandum to  the  Model ByelawsXIIIb 1934).  During the passage through Parliament of the Bill which becamethe Housing Act, 1935, the point was raised whether under modern conditions the  byelaw-making powers  ought to  be  extended to houses other than those for the working classes.  Such an extensionof the Housing code would be outside the scope of  the present Bill.If at any future time it is made, it will be a question whether thepowers ought not to be retransferred to* the Public Health code.  (2) Sections 71 to 75 of the Act of 1875 deal with occupation ofcellar dwellings.  Section 71 makes it  an offence  to let or  occupya cellar dwelling built after the passing of the Act or not lawfullylet or occupied at that date.  This section replaces a correspondingsection in the Public Health  Act, 1848,  and consequently its effect is that  no  cellar built  since  1848  can  be  lawfully occupied.Section 72 lays down an elaborate set of requirements which mustbe complied with if a cellar is to  be  occupied  as a  dwelling.   Sinceunder the previous section the occupation of cellars built since 1848is absolutely barred,  the section in effect only  applies  to cellars letor occupied  before that year.  Section 73 provides penalties, Section74 contains  a definition of occupying a cellar as  a dwelling,  and section 75 provides that the  cellar may be closed by order of thecourt, if two convictions relating to  it  have taken  place  within three months.  .  These   sections  are in  our  opinion no   longer  required  inI view of  Section  18 of the Housing  Act, 1925, and Section 84 ofthe  Housing Act,  1935.   The  former section,  as  amended bythe Fifth Schedule to the Housing Act,  1930, provides  in effect thata room habitually used as. a sleeping place the floor of which is morethan three  feet below the  adjoining  street,  or below any groundwithin nine feet  of the room, is to be  deemed  unfit  for.human habitation,  unless  the room  is on  average at least seven feet inheight and  complies with  regulations  prescribed by  the  localauthority, with the consent  of the. Minister,  for  securing  properventilation and lighting and protection against dampness, effluvia orexhalation.  Model  regulations  under this section have  been issued by  the Ministry (Series XXII).  These regulations cover substantially the same points as  are mentioned in Section 72  of the Act of 1875.section 84 of the Housing Act, 1935, enables the local authority to  secure the closing of the room by means of a closing order, if it does  not comply with the necessary requirements and extends Section 18  (f the Act of 1925 to underground rooms which  are  not used for  keeping.
                            PART X.                        CANAL BOATS.  119. This Part of the Bill reproduces with slight alterations theprovisions of the Canal Boats Acts, 1877 and  1884, except certain sections relating to the education of children on canal boats, whichwere incorporated in the Education Act, 1921, and Section 12 ofthe Canal Boats Act, 1877, which, although not incorporated in theeducation  code,  empowers  companies  and associations  who owncanal boats to  establish schools, and has no relation to the  present bill.  120. The second and third paragraphs of Section 3 of the Act of1877  and Section 7 of  the Act of 1884, all of which  relate to thelettering, marking and numbering of canal boats, have  not beenreproduced  as  separate sections, since the subject is fully coveredby the power to make regulations with regard to lettering, markingand numbering contained in Section 2 of the  Act of  1877 and re-produced in Clause 250.  121. Section  7 of the Act of 1877,  provides that  a registrationauthority  in   respect  of   canal   boats  is  to be such  one  ormore of the sanitary authorities having districts abutting on  a canalas may be prescribed by  the Local  Government Board.   In theGeneral  Order  made under this Act and dated 20th March, 1878,the Board  did not in fact. prescribe  registration authorities but merely provided that the owner of a canal boat should apply to aregistration authority having a district abutting on a canal.  TheOrder has in this respect remained unchanged to  the present  date.Clause.248 simplifies the procedure by dispensing with the necessityfor an Order and provides  in terms that a local authority,  or, if anumber  of  local authorities  are combined to form a port health authority, the port health authority, whose  district includes or abutson some part of a canal is to be the registration authority.  122. Section 8 of the Act  of 1884, which provides that fines re-covered in  prosecutions at  the instance of registration of sanitaryauthorities shall be paid to these authorities and applied towards theexpenses of executing the Acts, has not been reproduced.   Specialappropriations  of court fines such  as these are contrary to  modernpractice  as giving the prosecuting authority an undesirable financial interest in  the success of  the prosecution, as well as complicatingthe administration of the  business of the court.                            PART XI.                      MISCELLANEOUS.   123. Most of the provisions relating to watercourses are drawlfrom the  Act  of 1925, and all of them were enacted before thepassing of the  Land Drainage Act, 1930, which enabled a drainage
fcoard to be constituted for any area requiring drainage and removedthe limitation on the activities  of drainage boards to the  drainageof land used for agricultural purposes.  , This later legislation hasliminished the  need for some  of these provisions in the  PublicHealth Acts, and  has given rise to the possibility of a conflict  of jurisdiction between sanitary authorities and drainage boards.  Weunderstand that, in consenting to the  adoption of these sectionsof the  Act  of  1925 in  urban districts  with  a  population  less[ban  20,000,  and  in putting  them,  in force  by order  in rural districts, the  Minister usually  imposes the condition  that worksshall  not  be executed without  the consent  of  any  land  drainageauthority  having jurisdiction over the  watercourse.    The largerurban authorities can, however, adopt these provisions of the act of 1925 without the necessity  for the  Ministers  consent.  124. In view of the  general establishment of  drainage  boardsunder the Act of 1930, as well as of the  powers conferred on county and county borough councils by that Act,  it seems reasonable thatthe powers of all local authorities under Clauses 258-263 should  becoordinated  with the  activities of drainage  boards.  At the sametime  these provisions are principally  designed to prevent danger to health, and it seems undesirable that a drainage board should be ina position to impose an absolute veto on proposals which a sanitary authority  have found necessary on grounds of health.   Instead  of requiring  the consent of the drainage board, Clause 265  therefore provides for  prior consultation, and this requirement  is  extended to all local authorities.                        FART XII.                        GENERAL. The points arising on  the clauses  in  this  Part of the Bill are dealt with in the notes on clauses.  Mention may here be made ofi number of provisions of the public health law  which are eitherrepealed without re-enactment or are left outstanding.                 Public Health Act, 1875.                        Section 206. 125.  This section requires  local  authorities to  make  annualsports in such form and at such  time as the Minister may direct all works executed and  of all  sums received and  disbursementsMade by them under the Act during the previous year.  We under-tad that neither the Local Government Board nor the Ministeraas ever given any direction with regard to the form of the  report the  time at  which  it  must  be made, and consequently  the gation has  never come  into force.   The returns made by localauthorities under the Local Taxation  Returns Acts (now Part XIdjjhe Local Government Act, 1933) cover a large part of the field,  it is one of the statutory duties of the medical officer of health
to make a report on the matters with which he is concerned.  Webelieve that some  authorities adopt a practice of issuing a  reportof their activities  covering the report of their medical officer ofhealth,  and  this  practice  might  with  advantage  become morecommon;  but,  in  view of the fact that  the  section has remained a dead letter for 60 years, it has been omitted from the Bill.                        Sections 213-215.                   Private Improvement  Bates.  126. In substance these sections provide that where an  urbanauthority have  incurred certain types of  expenditure (e.g., on theprovision of drains or the conversion of closets) they may levy onthe occupier of  the premises concerned a private improvement rate.The occupier  is entitled to deduct a certain proportion of this ratefrom his rent, the  proportion varying according as he pays a rack-rent or something  less than a rackrent.   Provision is made for theredemption of the  rate on payment of a lump sum.  Our experience  leads us to think that  this procedure  is veryseldom used, and this view is borne out by the Ministry of Health.In view of this and of the fact  that the alternative procedure inSection 257 of  the Act of 1875  (reproduced in Clause  284 of  theBill)  enables expenses to be recovered either in a lump sum or by instalments over a period not exceeding 30 years, we are  satisfiedthat  the  system of private  improvement  rates  can properly be abandoned  as respects subject  matters covered by the  Bill.  Theprocedure  which it provides for apportioning burdens between  theowner and the occupier, will be  secured by the Bill in another,and,  as  we think, more equitable manner  by enabling the localauthority and on appeal a court  of summary jurisdiction to  deter-mine  in  the  light of  the  considerations  which are  set out hiClause 2s5 of the Bill whether a particular charge should be  borneby the owner  or the occupier, or, if by both, in what  proportions.                          Section  233.  127. The last two paragraphs of this section (which relates to the borrowing powers  of local authorities) were repealed by the  LocalGovernment Act,  1933.  The  first paragraph  was  left standing,but,  having regard to  the language of Section  195  of that Act, 1we are  satisfied that  the paragraph is no  longer  required and should be repealed  with re-enactment.                          Section  234.  128. The whole  of this  section  except  the  last paragraph wasjrepealed by the Local Government  Act, 1933.  The last paragraph Jprovides, in effect,  that where a local authority borrow for expeichargeable on a part of  the district only they must, so far as they 1can, make good the borrowed  money out of rates levied on that part jof the district.  In view of the language of Clause  11  (2) of tlielBill this provision  is no longer required.
  129. The object of this section was to provide a summary methodof recovering rates made under the Act.  If private improvementrates are  abolished, the only rate to which  the section  could  nowapply would be a water rate made under Part IV of the Bill  and,as Section 74 of the Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847, which is incor-porated in the Bilk contains a  procedure for summary recovery  ofwater rates, the section becomes unnecessary  as respects subjectmatters covered by the Bill.                           Section 262.  130. This section provides that no rate, order, conviction or thing-made or  done or relating  to the  execution of the  Act is  to bei vacated, quashed or set aside for want of form, and, further,  that unless otherwise expressly provided by the Act, no such rate, order, etc., is to be removed by a certiorari or other writ into any of the superior courts.  We considered  this  section in the course of our  preparation  of the Local  Government Bill,  since it is clear that if the section  is useful in connection with public health matters  it would  be equally useful in connection with other local government services.  We  felt, however,  such doubt as to its utility that we did not recommend its insertion  in an extended form in that Bill.  Further  considera- tion has convinced us that the section might properly be abandoned.   As regards rates,  it would have no  effect in the present  Bill except in  the matter of a water rate.  A provision that orders, etc., are not  to be set aside for  want of form may be valuable in cases where, as is usually the case under the Public Health  Acts, the form of the order is scheduled to the Act.  Under the present  Bill it is proposed that these forms should be prescribed, and Clause 277   the Bill enables a prescribed form or a form of substantially the   e effect to&apos;be  used.   This appears to us to  give the necessary  lasticity.   As regards the provision  that  orders,  etc.,  should not be re-  Mvable  by  certiorari,  we  consider that the  ordinary  principles  upon which in certain  cases  decisions of  subordinate  tribunals can   removed to  the High Court by  this process should be  applicable   public health  matters no less  than in other  spheres.   These   mciples have been in recent years  elaborately discussed in the  Hurts:   see,  e.g.,  B.  v.  Electricity   Commissioners,   [1924]   K.B. 171.                            Section 292.   131. This  section provides  for the manner in which port sanitary  nthorities and joint boards  are  to raise  within  the district of  a   &quot;faulting authority  any sum  which  may be due  to them.   Its  fa is now taken by Section 13 of the Bating  and Valuation Act,   925.
                          Section 295.  133. This  section  provides  that  orders made  by the  minister under the Act are to be binding and conclusive, and shall be pub-lished in such manner as  the  Minister may direct.  The effect  ofthe first part of the section is  not altogether certain, but it is well established that the words do not preclude a court from consideringthe question whether an  order  is intra vires.  That being so,  itappears that the  words effect little or  nothing,  and might with advantage  be repealed.   The  latter part of the  section requiring the publication of orders in  such  manner  as  the Minister  may Idirect appears to us also to be unnecessary.                          Section 303.  134. This section,  which has  been left outstanding, enables the ]Minister on the application  of the  local authority of  a  districtprovisional order to repeal, alter or amend  any local  Act affectingthe district, other than an Act for the conservancy of rivers, or an act conferring  powers or privileges  on  any person  for  his  ownpecuniary  benefit.   The section is widely  used.  We  considered whether we  should not re-enact it in the Bill  as regards matterscovered by the Bill  and subsequently include a  similar clause in jeach of the further Public Health Bills which are  contemplated.It appears, however,  that if  this  plan were adopted there would remain  a number  of  subjects covered by the section but not byany  of  the new Public  Health Bills,  and that it would  conse-quently  be  necessary to keep the  section  on foot  for  theseresiduary purposes.  Examples  of purposes  for which the section is from  time to time employed,  but  which  are not withinscope either of the present  Bill or any  of the proposed Bills,the acquisition of  land for  purposes other  than public health *in advance of  any specific purpose  having  been determined, alsosuperannuation and  finance.    Some  of   these purposes  coilmore appropriately be  dealt  with  in a Local  Government Actthan  a  Public  Health Act, while the splitting up of the provisoin this  way between  a number of Bills would be  certain toto difficulties.   In the circumstances  we have come to the conclojsion that the best course would  be to leave  the section outstandingin the Act of 1875, but by Clause 309 to make the purposes of ft]Bill purposes for which the section can  be used.  At  a future df&apos;it might be transferred to the general Local Government Code.  132. This section, which enables  the  Minister to make orders asto the costs of proceedings instituted  by,  or of appeals to, him under  the Act is virtually superseded  by Section 290  (4)  of  theLocal Government Act, 1933, which, by virtue of Clause 310 of theBill will  apply to inquiries held under the Bill.
  135. This section enables the Minister to settle differences arisingout of the transfer of the powers,, duties, liabilities  and propertyeffected under the Act or under provisional orders made thereunder.The present  Bill makes no provision for  an automatic transfer ofany such powers, duties, etc., and, as regards orders made under theBill, there is ample power for the order itself to contain any neces-sary consequential provisions, with regard to the settlement of differences, etc. : see  Clause 9 (1).                          Section 340.  136. This section provides that where there is a local Act in forceproviding for purposes similar to  those of the general Act, pro-ceedings may be instituted under either,  but that  no person is tobe  punished  for  the  same offence  under both, and that  the localauthority are not to be exempt from any obligation imposed by thegeneral Act.   The last mentioned provision has been  covered  by extending  Clause 320 of the  Bill  to  duties as well as to powers.The remainder of the section  is unnecessary in view  of Section 33of the  Interpretation  Act, 1889.           Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1885.                           Section 7.  137. This  section  provides  that  it shall be the duty of everycouncil entrusted&apos;with  the execution of the laws  relating to localgovernment and public health to  exercise  as  occasion may arisethe powers with which they are invested so as to secure the  propersanitary conditions of  all premises within their  area.   The pro-vision  in  the main applies only to  Barts II to IV of the Bill and.it has been omitted in view of  the opening  words of  Clause 1 placingupon local authorities, county councils and  certain special authorities the duty of carrying the Act as a whole into execution.                  Local Government Act, 1888.                          Section 19.  .138. This section requires the medical officer of health of a county district to send  a copy of his report to  the county council,  andifurther provides that, if it appears  to the county council from suchreport that the Act  of. 1875  has  not been- properly put in force&apos;in  the district, or that any other matter affecting the public  healthrequires to be remedied, they may cause  a representation to be-made  to the Minister.   This  duty is no doubt an important one,but as the primary duty to make the report is based on  regulations made  under  Section  108  (1)  (a)  of  the  Local Government Act,1933,  and as the&apos;regulation-making power  is amply wide enoughto  cover the point, we think the duties should be imposed by regu-lation  rather  than by  statute.  The power which the section confers
on a county council to make representations to the Minister, is ineffect covered by Clause 315 of the Bill.  139.  The foregoing paragraphs deal with  the major  points  onwhich, for the reasons indicated, we recommend that the law shouldbe amended.  The notes  on clauses, which appear in the Appendix,deal with a number of minor amendments which we recommend,and to which effect is given in the draft Bill.                        CONCLUSION.  140.  The reception of  the Local Government Bill and its smoothand  speedy passage through Parliament encourage the  hope thatthe present Bill may similarly find its way to the statute book with-out substantial amendment.   The alterations of the law which  werecommend in this Report and incorporate in  the Bill are not inour opinion more numerous or drastic than those accepted by Par-liament in the Local Government Bill with two possible exceptions,-namely,  the proposals with regard to the vesting of sewers in localauthorities and those relating to byelaws.  These points  are dealtwith more particularly in paragraphs 32-44 and 64-70 of the Report.In  both Bills  we  have&apos; felt  ourselves  at liberty to  suggest  theinclusion in  the  general law  of  powers  commonly  conferred by  Parliament  in local legislation  and in  this  connection  wemay again refer  to- the report  of  the Select  Committee  ofthe  House  of  Commons  on  Private  Bill  Procedure   (H.C.158  of  1930)  to  which  we drew  attention  in paragraph  106of our  first Report.  The recommendation that a Public Bill shouldbe introduced every five years to make general the provisions usuallyinserted  in local Acts has not  been carried  out in the sphere ofpublic  health  legislation, no doubt owing to  the claims on Parlia-mentary time of other and more urgent matters.  It would in ourview be a matter for regret if the present opportunity were not takento make good at  least  some of the arrears  of legislation in thisrespect.  14.1. In concluding these general observations we may add that weare conscious  that mistakes will have been made in an attempt toreduce to order a singularly difficult  and complicated  branch ofthe statute law, and that  both  the draft Bill and the commentarycontained in  this Report  might be  improved  if we  could devotefurther time to them.   We realise,  however, that unless the bill and Report  are  published  early  in  the year  there  can  be  no prospect  of legislation reaching the Statute Book in the present session, and for that reason we have thought it better to make an earlier Report at the risk of some errors and omissions which furtherdeliberation might  have avoided.   In particular, the schedule ofrepeals will require further careful examination.  If it  is decided toproceed with our proposals,  these  defects can be repaired  before the introduction of the Bill or while it is under discussion in Parlia-ment.  We realise also  that while, the Local Government Bill was
concerned for  the  most part with the machinery of  local govern-ment, the  present  Bill touches at many  points  the interests of individuals.   In this  matter we  have  tried to  hold the  scalesevenly between  public and private interests, and while the  Billin some respects extends  the powers and  duties  of local authori-ties, we entertain  no doubt  that in many ways it provides more effective remedies than does the existing law against arbitrary actionon the part of a  local  authority.  As before, we  have  throughout proceeded on the footing that our task is not to frame an ideal law of public health,  but to reproducethe existing law with such  amendment  only as is in our opinionboth desirable in itself and also likely to command general assent.  Hardly had we  embarked on the branch of our task  which is covered  by this  Report when we were deprived of the services ofMr.  G.  J.  Cole, who had acted  as our  Secretary throughout thepreparation of the Local Government Bill, and to the value of whoseassistance we  called  attention in  our first Interim Report.  Mr.F. L. Edwards  of  the Ministry of Health was appointed  as  Mr.Cole&apos;s successor, and we desire to place on record our high apprecia-tion of his  services.   By his industry and  devotion to the task inband he has appreciably lightened our labours and made possiblethe publication of the Report at a. date compatible with the intro-duction  of the Bill  in the present  session.    &apos;                             We are, Sir,                                 Your  obedient.

                              APPENDIX                       NOTES  ON CLAUSES                                  Part I.                       LOCAL ADMINISTRATION.  Clause 1. The term &quot; local authority&quot;  is defined as meaning the councilof  a borough,  urban district,  or rural  district.  It  thus has  the samemeaning as throughout the Public Health Acts.  In  the  Local government act, 1933, the term is used to  cover  county councils and  parish councils-as well,  and it may be thought in some respects inconvenient to give it  adifferent meaning  in the present  Bill.  But though county  councils andparish councils have certain  public  health  functions,  the part that  theyplay is so different from that of the ordinary &quot; sanitary authority &quot;  thata single  expression to cover all five types of authorities would in the present bill serve  no useful  purpose,  and on the whole the most convenient courseseems to be to use the term to denote urban and rural authorities.  The  powers  of a parish council  under the Bill  will be  found in Clauses125, 198, 230 and 259.  Clause 2. This  clause  substantially reproduces  the  existing  law  withjregard to port sanitary districts, but the following  points of difference may,be  noted       (1) The  provision  in  Section 287 of the Act of 1875, enabling two    or more riparian authorities to be combined but  &quot;without  the constitu-    tion of  a  joint  board has  not been  reproduced.  In no  instance has    such a combination  been  made, and it  would be  impracticable for the    combination  to function effectively.      (2) Subsection (4)  follows precedents such  as Section 146 (3)  of the    Local  Government Act, 1933,  in  requiring  notice to  be given  to the    riparian authorities  concerned of the proposal  to  make  the order,  thus    giving  them  an  opportunity  of taking objection before  the form  is    finally settled.      (3) The  third  paragraph  of  Section 287, which enables  the Minister    to make a temporary order, has not been reproduced.  The power has    never been exercised since 1885, and for  practical purposes  was rendered    unnecessary by the Public Health (Ships,  etc.)  Act of that year, which    enabled orders to which no objection had been taken to become effective    without  confirmation  by Parliament.      (4) The  clause  provides  in terms for the incorporation of the joint    board,  and thereby  assimilates the position of  these  boards to joint    boards  constituted under  Clause  6.   Under  the  existing  law  incor-    poration can be, and is,  effected by applying Section 280 of the Act of    1875.  Clause 5. See paragraph 30 of the  Report.  Clause 6.- Subsection  (1) of  the clause in reproducing  Section 27? ofthe Act of  1875,  omits  the reference in paragraphs  (1) and (2)  of  that section to specific  purposes supply of water,  etc.  These  paragraphs serveno  useful purpose,  and under  present  conditions are  somewhat misleading,since by far the  commonest type of joint hoard is a board for the provision and maintenance  of hospitals a  purpose . not  referred  to.  The simples&apos;course  is to provide that a joint board may be  created for  any purposeof  the  Act.
81i9 The reference in Section  280 to ex-officio members lias not  been repro-duced.    It  appears that the view has  been held in the Local  GovernmentBoard and the  Ministry of Health  that the  section does  not compel theinclusion of ex-offlcio members, and the practice  of  including them has,we  understand,  been abandoned.  No  provision. for ex-officio  members  isto be found- in any of the more modern codes  for  constituting  joint boardsor joint  committees. Section 282  and  Schedule I  of the Act are  not reproduced.   The first half of  the Schedule was  repealed  by  the Local  Government  Act, 1933.We recommend  the repeal without re-enactment of the  second half,  whichsets out  rules of procedure for  joint  boards, on the ground that these rulesare more appropriate to  the  order constituting  the board than  to  thestatute itself,  and  that  the necessary power  to make such  rules  is  foundin  Section 293  of the  Local  Government Act,  1933, which  enables  theprovisions of that  Act to be  applied to joint boards with any necessarymodifications. We have considered the  question whether orders  constituting these joint boards  should in  all circumstances require  confirmation by  Parliament.In this connection  recent legislation displays great variety.  Thus     (1) Under  Section  287 of the Act of  1875, as amended by Section 3   of the Public Health  (Ships, etc..) Act,  1885,  two  or  more  riparian   authorities can be combined to  form a port sanitary authority by  an   order  which requires Parliamentary  confirmation only   if  objection  is   taken to it.    (2) A  similar procedure  is to  be  found in Section  29 of the Mental   Deficiency  Act,  1913, under which a joint board may  be constituted  by   order  and Parliamentary confirmation  is  required only where one  or   more of the councils object.    (3)  Under  Section 3 of  the Poor Law Act, 1930, the Minister has power   by order to combine two or more  councils whether or not application has   been  made for  the purpose, but unless all the  councils  assent a local   inquiry must first be held.  In any case the order must be laid before   Parliament and is liable  to  annulment by Address.    (4)  Under  Section 5 of the Public  Health (Tuberculosis) Act, 1921, the   Minister may constitute  a joint  committee by order but only with the   consent of all  the councils  concerned.    (5)  Under  Section  112 of the  Housing Act,  1925,  the Minister  may   constitute a  joint committee by order whether with or without  consent.    (6)  Under  Section 4 of the Town  and Country Planning Act,  1932,  a   combination  may be formed  by order, but unless all the councils  consent   a local inquiry must first be held. In our  view the  proper course is to adopt the same procedure as in therase of  port health authorities, and to enable  authorities to be combinedly a simple  order  except where one or more  of  them raise objection,  inAicli case the order  should not have effect until confirmed by Parliament.Ks is effected by subsection (4) of the clause.      . Clause  S. See paragraph  31 of the B,eport. Clause  9. In view  of  Section 293 of  the  Local  Government Act,  1933,   language of  Section 281  of  the Act of  1875 has  been much shortenedJ&quot;d simplified.  The clause follows well-established Parliamentary precedentsl enabling the  Minister  to insert in the  order  such supplementary  and^sequential  provisions  as  he  considers  necessary. Provisions  enablingJ* orders to deal with the transfer- of property  and liabilities and withJinsfer,   compensation and  superannuation  of officers will  be found  inClauses 312 and  313.                . .:1
  In  Section 135  of the  Local  Government  Act,  1933,  the principle jsrecognised that a scheme may be  revoked or amended notwithstanding thatit has received  Parliamentary confirmation,  and that the  question whetherthe revoking or amending scheme should itself require Parliamentary con-firmation ought to depend not on whether the original scheme was provisionalhut on whether objection  is taken to  the revoking or amending  scheme.The same principle is  adopted in subsection (2) of the clause.  Clause  12. The  term  &quot; special purpose area &quot;  has  been substituted for&quot; special drainage  district.&quot;  The purposes for  which these  areas  are formedare not limited to  drainage and  the  existing title  is in many  cases  amisnomer.  The clause omits  the  provision in Section  270  (3) of  the  Act  of 1875that if a loan has been raised the district can be dissolved only by provisional order.  This was obviously intended as  a protection to the lenders.  It hasnow become unnecessary,  since by  virtue of Section 197  (1) of  the  LocalGovernment Act,  1933, the  loan,  whether contracted before or after thecommencement  of  that Act,  is now charged on the whole of the revenues of the district council.  Clause  13. Under  Section 276  of  the  Act of  1875  the Minister is empowered  to make  an order on  the  application &quot; of  persons rated to therelief of  the poor, the  assessment  of whose hereditaments amounts  at theleast  to one-tenth of  the  net rateable  value   of  such  district,  or of anycontributory  place  therein&quot;.  In  reproducing  this  provision  we  have followed the precedent of  the Local Government Act, 1933, and have sub-stituted for  the  words  quoted  above  a reference  to  &quot; local  governmentelectors  for the district  or any  contributory  place therein, not  being lessthan  one hundred  or  one-third of  the  total  number  of  those electors,whichever is the less &quot;.  The &quot; urban  powers &quot; to which this  clause  applies will be found  in thefollowing clauses  of  the Bill:  Clause      40.   Notice of intention to  alter or reconstruct drains.      45.   Sanitary  conveniences  in factories,  etc.      78.   Removal  of noxious matter.      79.   Periodical removal of manure, etc.,  from stables.      108.   Offensive  trades.      109.   Byelaws  as to  certain  trades.      262.   Watercourses not  to  be culverted  except in  accordance with               approved plans.      263. Power to require cleansing and repair of culverts                                  Part II.                    SANITATION  AND  BUILDINGS.   Clause 14 takes  the place  of  Section 15  of  the  Act of 1875.   The  worji&quot; to provide such public sewers as may  be necessary for effectually drainingtheir  district for the purposes of this Act &quot;, reproduce almost verbatim tinlanguage of that section.   The language is  of  a wide and general charactsand we considered the possibility  of denning in the clause  more exactly i&apos;scope of  a local authority&apos;s  obligations in this respect.   We  came to t!*conclusion,  however,  that to  draft a new  formula might well do  more harm than  good  and that the  better  course  is  to re-enact  the  language  of tkc-xisting law, leaving the content  of the obligation  to be gathered from *general  tenor of this Part of the  Bill.
  The Act of 1875 contains no express duty to provide sewage disposal works,but empowers local authorities to do so in Section 27.  The provision of thenecessary works  has always, however,  been  recognised  as  a  duty,  and inSection  57  (3)  of  the  Local  Government  Act,  1929,  which enables  theMinister to  transfer public health duties of  a district council  to the  countycouncil in case of default, the provision  of a sewerage system and of  sewage disposal  works are treated as being on  the  same  footing.  Clause 15.  Subsection (1) of this clause reproduces the opening words ofthe first  paragraph of Section 14 of the Act of 1875.   Modern legislation has so largely diminished the class of  owners who  are  under disability  to sellthat we  have thought it unnecessary to  reproduce the  latter part  of the paragraph.  Section 16  of  the Act of 1875,  which  is  also  re-enacted  in the  clause,enables a local authority to acquire land outside their district.  The clauseomits  the  words for the  purpose of  outfall  or- distribution  of  sewagle.Experience  has shown that it is sometimes  necessary to lay sewers, otherthan outfall sewers, outside the district on account  of contours or irregular boundaries.                                                     ,.,  Subsection (2)  of the clause reproduces Section 16  (3) of the  Local  Govern- Hient Act,  1894,  but varies it slightly by requiring the district council togive the  parish council notice of their proposals at an earlier  stage.  Under the existing law notice  need not be given until the district council  &quot; have determined  to adopt plans for the sewerage ... of any contributory place &quot;. This is too late a stage in the proceedings for the parish council to have any real opportunity of making their views felt.   Clause 16.  In, reproducing Sections  32  to  34  of  the Act of  1875  this clause simplifies the procedure and  assimilates it to that laid  down in  Section 161  of the  Local Government Act, 1933, in connection  with a compulsory purchase of land.   The clause reproduces the existing right of the local authority and owners to object to the proposal and the power  of the Minister to decide, but makes one exception,  namely,  where the works merely consist in  the  laying of pipes in a  highway repairable by the inhabitants at  large and the  consent of the local authority has heen obtained.  In  that case  (which is dealt with in subsection (3)) the necessity of  public advertisement  and local  inquiry is  dispensed with.   Clause 17.  See paragraphs 32 to 44 of the Report.   Clause 18 is a new provision intended to  be ancillary  to the procedure of  taking over sewers provided in  the previous clause.  It will frequently be  convenient  both to the local authority and  the developer to arrange at the  time when the  sewer is constructed  that  it shall  &quot;he taken over  at  some  future date or  upon the happening  of  a future event, e.g., some  further  development  which makes  the sewer a  link  in the  general  system of  the  district. In  the absence of a provision of  this kind doubts may arise how  far the  local authority can commit itself in advance (cf. York Corporation  v. Leetham (Henry)  and Sons,  [1924]  1 Ch.  557).   Clause 19 reproduces and slightly extends Section 40  of the Act  of  1925.   That  section enables a  local authority to  require  a  developer who is con-   structing a sewer to make  it larger than is necessary for his own purposes,   the authority paying the additional cost.   The clause widens this power so   is to enable  the authority, if satisfied that the proposed sewer  is needed to   form  part  of the general sewerage system, to  require  it to  be constructed   B a  different manner  as regards material, size  of pipes, depth, etc.  The   lause further provides that the authority are to pay  not only the additional   spense involved in  the construction of  the  sewer but  also  any  additional   tost of  maintenance, and imposes a penalty on the developer if h&amp; fails to   imply  with the requirements of the local  authority.
  Clause 20.  See paragraphs 32 to 44 of the Report.  The proviso to subsection (2) is intended to deal with the case of municipalhousing estates and other  property  in  connection  with which the localauthority may own sewers otherwise than as the sewerage authority.  Clause 21,  which  is new, has heen inserted to  meet  a  difficulty whichhas become more acute by reason of the transfer of  roads  to county  councilseffected by the Local Government  Act, 1929.   Under  Section 29  (2) of thatAct  all drains  belonging to roads for which the county  council are made responsible vest in the council.  Where, as  is frequently the  case, a highwajdrain  or sewer is  also used for  conveying surface water  from buildingsstreets not vested  in the county council, the local authority responsible for1the  drainage  of  buildings  and  streets may   find  themselves  under  1necessity  of  constructing  a new  sewer  unless they  can secure  access  onreasonable  terms to  the  highway drain or  sewer.  The object of the clauseis to  enable this to be done.  The clause also deals with the  converse case of arrangements under whicbsurface water from  county  roads  may be admitted into sewers  belongingto local authorities.  Clause 22.  The proviso  to Section 18 of the Act  of 1875 is omitted fromthis clause and reproduced in more general  terms in  Clause 31.  Clause 24.  See paragraph 41  of the Report.  Clause 25.  Section 26  of the Act  of 1875,  which is partially replaced by this clause, makes it an offence to erect a building over any sewer of :urban authority without  the  consent of the  authority.  The section was extended to rural areas by a general order (S.R. &amp;  O. 1931, No.  580). Tieclause  adopts the procedure  discussed  in paragraph  49 of  the report under which  the local authority&apos;s  decision is given in terms of  passing oirejecting  plans.   The restriction on  the right to  build  is limited  tocase of sewers of which the building owner  is or can without difficulty makehimself aware,  and accordingly the sewers are  defined by reference  tomap which  is required to be kept under Clause 32 (see note on that  clause)  Paragraph  (2) of section 26, which relates to cellars under the carriage-way  of a street, is left unropealed as not being appropriate to the  present bill.  Clause 26 reproduces  Section 7  of  the Rivers Pollution Prevention Act,1876.   Proviso (a)  to the  clause is new and is required  to meet the caseof separate foul and  surface water sewers.  The concluding words of  the  section  &quot;  nor  where  such  facilities wonliinterfere with any order of any court of competent jurisdiction respecting the sewage of  such  authority &quot;  have been omitted as being unnecessarj.As regards the general  question of trade  effluents  see  paragraphs  45 and46 of  the Report.  Clause 27 represents a combination  of Sections 16  and 17 of the Act of1890 and Section 41 of the Act of 1925.  The provisions of  the three sectionswith regard to  penalties have been assimilated.  Clause 28 reproduces  the first portion of Section 28 of the Act of 187a. jThe words  of that section, &quot; or, in the case of dispute,  may be settled 1the Local  Government Board,&quot;  have  been omitted.  The section did noilenable  the  Board to  compel one authority to  allow the sewers of anottefauthority to  communicate with its own.   In the absence of such a poufflof compulsion a power to settle the terms upon  which the communicatiolIis to  be made is ineffective, since  the authority who are  invited to fthe communication can avoid the jurisdiction of the Department by declinWSJto entertain the proposal  at  all, unless the terms suggested are  wholly *rtheir  satisfaction.
  On the  other  hand . there is,  of  course,  nothing  to prevent  two  localauthorities agreeing to submit any outstanding point for the determination of the Minister, and no  express power for this purpose is necessary.  The j)roviso to the section has also been omitted as unnecessary.  It dealswith matters which should clearly form part of the  agreement between thetwo  authorities.  The clause  extends  to London so  as  to  put the  metropolitan  sewerageauthorities in a position to make arrangements with adjoining authorities.  Clause 32: Section 20 of the Act of  1875 empowers, but does not require,an urban authority to  provide a  map of their sewerage system.  The sectionwas  extended to rural  areas by a general  order (S.R.O.  1931, No.  580).Section  3 of the Public  Health Act, 1875  (Support of Sewers) amendment act  1883,  by incorporating Sections 19-21 of the  Waterworks Clauses Act,1847,  places  an obligation  on local authorities to provide  a map of theirsewers,  to  make it available to all persons  interested,  and to keep  it  upto date.  We  doubt whether this obligation  has been widely observed out-side the mining areas.   A map is important  for two reasons       (I) a  prohibition  against building over sewers cannot reasonably  be    imposed unless  persons  desiring to  build can ascertain the existence and    location or the  sewers;      (2) in view of the  practice  which has grown up  since 1875 of providing    separate sewers for surface water and foul water, the public may fairly    expect to know whether such a separate  system  has been adopted  and,    if so, which sewers are  available for either purpose.  On  the  other hand, it  is generally recognised  that  in  the older urban areas there may  well be sewers built  by private persons before the days ofbyelaws, the exact position of which is not accurately known, and it would inour opinion be unreasonable to put ratepayers to the expense of  a specialsurvey for the purpose of ascertaining  their whereabouts.  The clause accord-ingly requires local authorities to keep a map of their public sewers, but inthe case of  an existing  sewer only if  it is reserved  for  foul or for surfacewater.  Where the  double system has  been adopted and a particular  sewerhas been appropriated for  one purpose or the other, it can be assumed thatthe sewer can without  difficulty be marked on the map.  In  addition, sewerswhich are about to be taken over as  public  sewers  must be shown on  the map (Subsections (1), paragraphs (b) and (e) ) and the map must distinguish between surface  water  and  foul water sewers  (Subsections (2) ).   It is permissible under the clause for a local authority to mark on the map publicsewers other than those that they are required to mark.  Clause 34: Section 21 of the Act of 1875  entitles  the owner or  occupier of premises to  cause his drains to communicate with a sewer, but requireshim to give the local authority notice of his intention, to conform with theirregulations as to mode of communication, and to carry out the work subjectto the control of the person appointed by the authority to  superintend  it.Under Section  38 of the Act of 1907  the authority  may require the  wholedrain to be laid  open  for  examination and the communication may not  bemade until their surve37or has certified that the drain  may properly be  madeto communicate with the sewer.  The two sections  as  they stand are unsatis-factbry, since the right conferred on the owner  by  the opening  words ofSection  21 is largely whittled down by Section 38 of the later Act which gives the surveyor the power (apparently not subject to appeal) to refuse to allowcommunication to be made.  Further, the earlier section has given rise  to difficulties over the questionwhether a  local authority can prohibit an owner from connecting a surfacewater drain with a foul  water sewer,  and it  is not easy to  reconcile all theeases, of which the following may be cited : Ainley v. Kirkheaton L.&apos; B.(1891), 60 L.J. Oh.  734;  Brown v. Dunstable  Corporation, (1899), 2  Ch: 378;
Kinson. Pottery Company v. Poole Corporation, [1899] 2 Q.B. 41; Wilkinsonv. Llanolaff, &amp;c, B.B.C.,  [1903]  2 Ch.  695,  and  Matthews  v.  Strahcan[1901], 2. K.B. 540.  In  view  of  the  growing  practice of  having  separate  systems for thedisposal of  foul  water and surface  water,  we are satisfied that any  repro-duction of these sections must clear up this point.   The clause accordinglyprovides that  where  there  is  a separate  system,  foul water  may  not be discharged into a surface water sewer,  and  that surface water  may only be discharged into a foul water  sewer  with the approval of the local authority.This latter  provision has been  inserted to meet the  common case where theauthority, with a view to saving the owner the expense of laying separatepipes,  permits  the surface water from the yard at the rear  of the house andfrom the hack  of the roof to  he drained into the foul water sewer.  Subsection (3)  of the  clause safeguards the position of  owners by pro-viding  an appeal  against  the refusal  of  a local authority to permit the communication, and denning the  ground,  namely,  that the communicationwould  be prejudicial to the authority&apos;s drainage system, on  which permissionmay be refused.  Section 21 of the Act of 1875 requires the owner  in connecting  his drainwith the sewer  to comply with the &quot; regulations &quot; of the local authority. this requirement has been omitted, since the  position will be  governed  by theauthority&apos;s  byelaws.  (-See paragraph 66 of the Report and paragraph 22 ofthe Report  of the Departmental Committee on Building Byelaws.)  As  regards subsection (2) see paragraph 20 of the Report.  Clause 35 takes the  place of  Section 22 of the Act of 1875, which providesthat  the owner or occupier of premises  without  the district of  a localauthority may  cause his sewer or drain to communicate with the sewer of theauthority on terms  to be agreed or,  in case of  a dispute, settled by  a courtof summary jurisdiction or  by an arbitrator.   In effect the new  clauseplaces the  owner or  occupier  of  premises  without the district of  a localauthority in the same position as the owner or occupier of premises  withinthe district (i.e., it enables  him to have a connection made subject  to thecontrol of  the local  authority as set out in the previous  clause), but withthe additional  requirement  that  he may  be called upon  to  make  to theauthority a reasonable payment or periodical payments, the amount being determined, if  necessary, by  a  court of  summary  jurisdiction or,  by  anarbitrator.  In  view of  the large  degree of control  which local authorities have ouercommunications  between drains and sewers in the  case of premises  within their district,  the only additional power which it is necessary  to  confer on them in the case of premises outside the  district is a power to call on theowner to make a reasonable contribution towards the expenses of their drain-age system.  Effect is given to this by the proviso to subsection (1), and subsection (2) of the clause.  Subsection (3)  is new.  It enables the  local authority of the district inwhich the premises are situate to  contribute towards any  expense incurred by  the owner under the clause.  Experience has shown  that it may  well beto the advantage of  a  local authority  to  assist the  owner of premises onthe borders of their  district in  securing  a connection  with sewers  outsidethe  district, rather than to have  the expense of  themselves  providing  asewer  for his  needs.  Clause 36.   Section 18 of the Act of 1890 provides  that  where the owneror occupier of  premises  is entitled to cause a drain to communicate with one of the local authority&apos;s sewers, the authority  shall, at the request ofthe owner or occupier,  and  upon having the cost paid  in  advance, execute the necessary works.   Section 38 of the Act of 1925 replaces this provision in  areas  where  the section is  in  force  by a provision substantially similarbut conferring on  the local  authority  instead  of on the owner or occupier
of the  premises  the option  to  carry out  the works.   The  latter  sectionhas been widely put into  operation and is substantially reproduced in theclause.  For the protection of owners the clause requires the local authorityto give notice  within 14 days.  Section 38 (5)  of the Act  of  1925, which enables the local authority toaoree with  the owner or  occupier of premises  to make  or alter drainsor sewers,  or  to effect connections which he  is  required  or  desires tomake,  alter  or effect, has little  connection  with  the remainder  of thesection  and is  reproduced  in a generalised form in Part  XII  of  the Bill(Clause  272).,  Subsection (4)  is new.   It  will enable the local authority to  insist  uponexecuting themselves any work which entails breaking up the highway.  Clause 37.  The obligations  at present  imposed  on owners  of  existing buildings and persons erecting new buildings in  regard to drains and cess-pools must  be ascertained from several sections of the various  Public HealthActs.   They may  be  summarised as follows :    (1) Section 23  of the Act  of 1875 enables  a  local  authority  to requirethe owner of a house which  is without  a  sufficient  drain to  make  a drainemptying into  a  sewer, if there is  one  within ICO  feet or,  if not, into acesspool.   The section empowers the authority to  do the work  on defaultand recover the expenses.  (2) Section 25  of the same Act  makes  it illegal  to  erect  a  new house,unless  a suitable drain has  been  constructed,  and contains similar pro-visions  with  regard  to  the drain  emptying  into a sewer  if there is onewithin 100 feet, and otherwise into a cesspool.  The section imposes penalties for contravention, and by section 36  of  the Act of  1925  the  court is empowered in  the case of a person convicted of constructing  a  drain in contravention of  the earlier  section to make an  order  requiring the drainto be relaid.   If  the  order is not  complied with, the  local authority may do the work  and  recover the expense.   Section  25  is limited to houses inboroughs and urban  districts.  (3) Section 41 of the Act of 1875 deals with drains,  water-closets, earth-closets,  privies, ash pits and cesspools.   As amended by Section 34 of theAct of  1907, it empowers  the local authority on 24 hours&apos;  notice,  or in emergency  without  notice, to  enter and  examine  premises  if  they  have reason to think  that any  drain,  cesspool  or  sanitary  convenience  on thepremises is  a  nuisance or injurious to health.   The  section enables theauthority to  require the necessary work to  he  done,  and in default  to  do itat the expense  of the owner or occupier.  (4) Section 49 of the Act of 1907 deals with  the provision of proper  sinksand drains and other necessary appliances for carrying off refuse  water, andenables  a local authority  to  require the owner or  occupier  of  a building to provide  these  appliances and on default to provide them  themselves athis expense.  In  attempting  to  amalgamate  these provisions  we  were met  by thedifficulty that  Section  25  of  the Act  of 1875 on the one  hand is limitedto boroughs  and  urban districts,  and on  the other  imposes an absoluteobligation on the person erecting a &quot; house &quot; to provide  a  drain.    It isgenerally recognised  that  in a  matter of  this kind a hard  and  fast dis-tinction between  urban and  rural  areas  is unsatisfactory,  and  that while there are many rural  districts  in  which the  section might properly  form part of the  general  law,  there are, on the other  hand, areas  of  a ruralcharacter  in urban districts  and even  in boroughs where a requirement that every house  without  exception must  have  a  drain may well be un-necessaryv  That  being so,  the right course, it  appears to us,  is  to abandon the distinction  and to make the provision which takes the place of section 25 a matter of general law  applicable to the country as  a  whole.  The  question to  what  type  of  building  the requirement of  a  drain should extend presents a further difficulty.  The word  &quot; house &quot; as used in.
sections 23 and 25 of the Act of 1875 may cover cases e.g., that of a barnin which  agricultural labourers are at times  at work, where a drain maybe quite unnecessary.  On the other hand  it does not cover  buildings, e.g.cinemas,  where persons  assemble for purposes  other  than - those  of work.Moreover, at the time when the decision whether or not to insist on a drainmust be reached by the local authority the building is still in the future andits character can be  judged only by the plans and statements submitted bythe person proposing to erect  it.  The clause is accordingly made to apply to the country as a whole andto all buildings,  but instead of imposing  an absolute  obligation to providea new building with drains, it requires the local authority, on examinationof the plans of the proposed building,  to  insist  upon  satisfactory  provisionfor drainage, unless in a particular case  they consider  that drainage may properly  be  dispensed  with,  the building  owner being given  a right ofappeal to a court of  summary jurisdiction on  this  point.  Subsection (3)  follows  the existing law in protecting the  owner  againstbeing  compelled to  connect his  drain with a sewer unless there is a sewerwithin 100  feet, and slightly elaborates the law by making it clear thatthe sewer must be  one with  which both  physically and legally he  is ableto make a connection.  Clause 38.   This clause  deals with the drainage of existing buildings andfollows the general  principles of the previous  clause.  If the  building iswithout the necessary  drainage  system,  the local authority can  require theowner to  make satisfactory provision for drainage and the work would, ofcourse, have to be done in conformity with the  current byelaws.  If on theother hand,  the question  is  one of lack of repair, or  a drain  becomingstopped up, the  obligation  to do the necessary  work may be placed either on the owner or on the occupier, as the authority think- proper.  (See para-graph 62  of the Report.)  In  either case a  right  of appeal to a  court  of  summary  jurisdiction isconferred.  Clause 39.   In reproducing Section 36 of the Act of  1907 in subsection (1)of the clause,  we  have added the words  &quot; or  sink.&quot;  Neither Section 36nor  Section  37 of the Act of  1907 deals specifically with  sinks,  as doesSection 49 of the same Act, but we understand that it is generally recognisedthat to connect a sink with a rain water pipe is contrary to modern sanitarypractice. . Clause  40  re-enacts  Section  39 of the  Act of 1925, but  adds the  word&quot; repair &quot; in  subsection (1) (a).   This  word  was in  the  Bill  for  the act of 1925, but was moved out when the Bill was  before the House of Lords.Parliament has,  however,. since approved  of the insertion  in a number oflocal  Acts of  a clause amending Section  39 by  the  insertion of the  word&quot; repair.&quot;  Clause 41 reproduces Section 24 of the Act of 1875 but extends  it to thecase of a  drain communicating with a cesspool.  Clauses  42, 43 and 44.  See paragraphs 50 to 55 of the Report.  Clause 45.  See paragraphs 57 to 59 of the Report.  Clause 46.  See paragraph 56  of the Report.  Subsection (3) of  Clause 46 makes good  a small defect  in  Section 39 ofthe Act of 1907.   That section provides for the local authority bearing halfthe expense if, and only if, they themselves do  the  work in  default of theowner.  It is  plainly right that an  owner who  is  willing  to do the  workhimself should  not thereby be  placed in a worse position, and the subsectionaccordingly provides for this  case.   Subsection  (4) is also new and  enables the local  authority  and the owner to come, to an understanding  on thefooting of the authority paying not more than half the cost in a case wherethe owner himself  takes  the initiative and the machinery of subsection (1)is not put into operation.         -  .-
   Clause  47 reproduces  the combined effect  of Section 41  of  the Act of 187S  and Sections 34 and 45 of the Act of  1907 in so far  as these  sections relate to  the testing of drains, etc.  The provisions of the sections requiring the owner to remedy defects are reproduced  in Clause 38.   For the omission of the references to  reports  of medical officers  of health, surveyors and sanitary  inspectors, see  paragraph  79  of  the Report.   Section 45  (1)  excludes  a test &quot; by  water under  pressure.&quot;   This pro- tection to owners  is slightly widened in the  clause  by omitting the  words &quot; by water.&quot;  Section 45 (3) is covered by  Clause 281 in part XII of the Bill which deals  with obstruction generally.  Clause 49.  This clause replaces Section 47  (3) of the Act  of 1875.  That subsection,  which applies to urban areas only, makes it an offence to allow the contents of any water-closet, privy or cesspool to overflow or soak away. The reference to water-closets and privies has been omitted  on the ground that if the  condition of  a closet or privy were such as to allow  of overflowor  soakage,  the  case could  be dealt  with  under Clause 43  or  Clause  44. The problem of the cesspool is more difficult.   The distinction  between urban and rural districts in a  matter of this kind is  highly artificial, since it is notorious  that the latter  comprise many  built-up areas  and the  former many  patches of  countryside.  We were at first disposed to apply the section to  the country as a whole, but  to limit it to overflow or soakage which is &quot; pre^idicial to health or a nuisance.&quot;   This qualification  would,  however, rob the  section   of  much  of   its   value   in   the  case  of  a  leaking cesspool,  since   such   a  cesspool may  well   be  a potential  source of danger to water  supply, notwithstanding that   it is impossible  to secure legal evidence, of nuisance or prejudice to health.  We have  found no way out of this  difficulty except by  introducing  an  element of  discretion.   The clause  is accordingly drawn  so as  to cover both  urban and  rural areas, but an offence is only committed if  the  person responsible fails  to take such steps to prevent leakage or overflow as the local authority or,  on appeal, a court of summary jurisdiction,  consider reasonable.  This  procedure will enable  the  authority and the court to  have  regard to the  whole circum- stances of the area, including the question whether  reasonable facilities  for having cesspools emptied are available.  It may  be added that the problem is  a narrower  one than  in 1875, since  the byelaws of  nearly  all  authorities require cesspools to be   constructed so  as  to be impervious.  As regards soakage, therefore, the clause is required mainly  to meet the case of cess- pools made before the byelaws were in  operation. In Section 47  the local authority are entitled  to recover  the expenses of executing  the  necessary  works from  the occupier of the premises.    The clause   substitutes  for the occupier the person responsible for the  soakage or  overflow,  who will no doubt  normally be the occupier.  Clause 50. Under Section 21  of the Act of 1890 which is  reproduced in this clause the  person in default becomes liable  to a penalty if  a  sanitary convenience  is in the opinion of the authority or  the  sanitary inspector or medical officer of health  in such a state as  to  be a nuisance.  The words italicised,  which would  apparently prevent the defendant arguing  that the alleged condition  did not obtain, have  been omitted on the ground  that the court should have power to deal  with this issue.  Clause 52: See  paragraphs 71 to 75 of the Report.  Clause 53  reproduces Section  25 of  the Act of 1890.  In  subsection (2) tie provision with  regard to a  continuing  penalty will operate subject to Clause  289 of the Bill, which enables the court to fix a date from which the penalty is to take effect.  As regards the procedure  see paragraph 49 of the Report.  Clause 54.   Under Section 23  of  the Act of  1890 the byelaw-making Powers of  Section 157 of  the Act of 1875  are extended to cover (inter  alia)
 &quot; the  provision in  connection  with  the laying  out  of new  streets,  of secondary means of  access where necessary for the purpose  of the  removal of house  refuse, and other matters &quot;.  As stated  in  paragraph 70 of  the  Report, we think that it is more con- venient  that this  should be a  substantive  enactment.    We  have also considered whether,  following a number  of recent local Acts,  the obligation to provide access should be in general terms  and not limited to the purpose of the removal  of refuse.  We have  come to the conclusion,  however, that this would  be too wide an  extension  of the law for  the present  Bill but that the limiting words &quot; in  connection with  the laying out of new  streets&quot; which, we understand, have  given  rise to difficulties, might with advantage be omitted.  As regards the  procedure see paragraph  49 of the Report.  Subsection (2) which follows the lines  of local Act provisions is necessary in order to secure that the means of  access once provided shall continue.  Clause  56  reprodtices  Section 26 of the Act of 1907.  The  second para- graph of that  section, which exempts from the operation  of the  section courts which are by reason  of  their situation, use, architectural  features, or other characteristics,  either wholly or in part necessary for, or  ancillary to,  the ornament or amenity of any  land or premises, has been  omitted on the  ground  that the language  is  so vague  as to be  almost impossible to apply.  On the  other  hand,   it  is  evident that  the  section  is intended to prevent obstruction  to proper ventilation of houses, and in order  to make this clear the word  &quot;  court  &quot; has been  qualified by the  words &quot; on  which any two  or  more houses front or  abut &quot;.  Clause  57  represents a combination of Sections  75  to 78  of  the Towns Improvement Clauses Act. 1847,  and  of common local Act provisions.  Under Section 160  of  the  Act  of 1875  the  provisions of  the Towns Improvement Clauses Act,  1.847, &quot; with respect  to ruinous or dangerous buildings &quot; are incorporated.  These provisions  are  long and  complicated, extending over some two  pages of  the  Statute Book.  In  effect, they provide that if  a building  or  wall in  a  borough or  urban  district is in a  ruinous state and dangerous to passengers or  to  occupiers of  neighbouring  buildings, the owner or  occupier may be required to  take down or repair the building or wall.  If  he  fails to take the necessary  action,  an order  may be  obtained from justices directing him  to do so.  If the  owner  cannot be  found, the local authority  are  entitled to take  the  building or land, on making com- pensation  to the owner, and to reimburse1  themselves  the cost  of pulling the building down out of the proceeds of sale.  In a number of local Acts Parliament has  granted somewhat similar powers  in  the case of buildings which  are so far dilapidated  as to be  unfit  for  use or occupation  and are in a structural  condition prejudicial  to the  property in, or the inhabitants of,  the neighbourhood.   Other local  Act  provisions deal  with the case of a building where its use  (e.g.,  the use  of the upper storeys of an old  dwelling house  for storing heavy goods) might well be  dangerous.  The clause com- bines these various provisions and  enables a  court  of summary jurisdiction, on  the&apos; application of  a local authority,  to restrict the  use of a building, if satisfied that its existing use  is  dangerous, and to direct the owner of a building  to  take the  necessary  steps,  whether by  demolition  or  repair, where the condition of  the  building is  dangerous, or  it  is so  ruinous or dilapidated, as to be  a source of annoyance to the occupants of neighbouringhouses or seriously detrimental to  the  amenities of  the neighbourhood. I&quot; the  event  of demolition the  owner may  be  required  to clear  up the site. though not to remove  all the materials.  Provisions  dealing with buildings  dangerous  to passengers in streets a&quot; not included in  this Bill, see paragraph  76  of the  Report.  Clause 58 takes the place of Section 36  of the Act of 1890, but is extend in accordance with  the  provisions common  in local  Acts to  cover  shopsstores  and warehouses to which the public are  admitted and  in which mo&quot;
that 20  persons  are employed, and clubs registered under the  Licensing(Consolidation) Act, 1910.  Clause 59 enables a local authority to require the owner of a building  towhich the clause relates  to provide  means of escape from each storey morethan 20 feet from the ground.  Under Clause 283  of the Bill the  owner willhave the usual right of  appeal to a court of  summary  jurisdiction  against these  requirements  and, subject  to this right,  the local  authority  will beentitled, if  necessary, to do  the  work and recover the expenses  from him.Similar  provisions  have  been included  in a number  of  local Acts.  Clause CO.. The general effect  of  this  clause  is  discussed  in  paragraphs64-70 of the Report.  The following points may be noted on subsection (1):        Paragraph (a).  This takes the place of Section 157 (2) of  the Act  of    1875 as  extended by  Section 23 (1) of the Act of 1890.   The term &quot; con-    struction  of  buildings &quot; is   used  to include the  various  parts  of    buildings walls, foundations,  roofs,  floors,  hearths  and staircases     enumerated in those sections.  - The paragraph  is  also  intended to cover    the  structure of  chimney shafts for the  furnaces of  steam engines,    breweries, etc.,  referred to in Section 24 of the Act of  1907.      The term  &quot; materials &quot;  is  introduced  for the  first time,  though  it    frequently occurs in local Acts.  It appears never  to have been doubted    that byelaws  may properly deal  with the materials of  buildings.      Paragraphs (6)  and  (c) represent  Section 157  (3),  the reference to    height of  chimneys  and  buildings being taken from Section 24  of the    Act  of 1907.   The word  &quot; lighting &quot; appears  in  many  local Acts, but    not  in the general law and, similarly, a power  to make byelaws  dealing    with the dimensions of rooms intended for human habitation is common    in local  Acts, though Section  23 of  the  Act of 1890 refers only  to the    height of such rooms.      Paragraph  (rf) represents  a portion of  Section 157  (4).  The  power    in Section 23 of  the Act of 1890 to make byelaws with respect to keeping    water-closets  supplied with sufficient water  for flushing, has  not been    reproduced as this point  is adequately met by the general power under    Clause 44  of the  Bill to compel the keeping of closets in  a  proper    condition.      Paragraph (e) is  taken from  Section 157 (4).      Paragraph  (/) is new.   The proper construction of  wells  is not less    important,  as  a matter  of  public  health,  than  that  of drains  and    cesspools.     Paragraph  (g) represents provisions which are common in local Acts,    enabling byelaws to  control such matters as  stoves, gas fires,  etc.     Paragraph  (Ji) is  new:  see  note on Clause 34.  Clause  61. This clause  deals with  the difficult question  of the  retrospec- tive effect of byelaws.    The existing law on this  point is obscure.    Sub- section (2) of Section 157 is limited to new buildings, but no  such  limitation appears  in subsections (3) and (4),  the distinction probably  being accidental. The section  as a  whole is limited by the proviso to buildings erected after the Local Government Acts came into force in the  area, or, in the case of a district  which was  not  an  urban sanitary  district in  1875, to buildings erected after it  became such a district.  This proviso is plainly defective, since while  it  protects  the  older  biiildings, it gives no  corresponding pro- tection to a building  erected after  1875  against  a byelaw  made at some later date.   Section  23 of the Act of 1890 provides  that byelaws with  regard to the drainage  of buildings  and to  sanitary conveniences in general may se made so as  to effect buildings erected before the times mentioned in the proviso to Section 157.   There can be little doubt that the  general principle iiould be that  a byelaw which deals with the structure of a building must not sleet  buildings standing  at the date when it is made,  so long as  the build-
- ing continues to be  used for the purpose for which  it was erected,  since this  would  involve wholesale  pulling  down  and  reconstruction.  On the other hand  byelaws affecting particular  appliances,  such as sanitary con- conveniences, should operate whenever the appliance is replaced by a new one, notwithstanding that the building itself may have  been in existence  before the byelaws were made.   The effect of subsections  (1) and (2) of the clause are to prohibit byelaws under paragraphs (a),  (b)  and (c) applying to existing buildings  except in the cases  mentioned  in subsection (1), i.e.  where  structural alterations or extensions take place or there is a material change  in the purpose for which the building is to be used..  &quot; Material  change &quot; is  denned by subsection  (2) so as to  cover the  use  for  dwelling  purposes  of  a building  not con-,structed for those  purposes, the occupation by several families  of a building constructed  as a single house, and  any  change from. one class  of user to another which has the effect of  bringing the building, or  any part of  it, under a different byelaw, e.g. it  is not unreasonable that the  conversion of a room  in a house into  a garage should make it  subject to  byelaws with regard to the use of  fire-proof materials!   Clause  62  enables  a local  authoritj7,  with the consent of the Minister, to relax  or  dispense  with a byelaw if its  application to the particular case before them would be unreasonable.   The authority are required to publish notice  of their  intention  to  exercise the power,  and  the  Minister  must, before  consenting,  take into  consideration any objections received by him, It has long been the  accepted view that  byelaws must not  themselves con- tain dispensing  powers,  and  accordingly  the  only  method, of  dealing with such  a situation  as  is  contemplated  in  the clause has  been  for the authority to make  a  special byelaw  limited in terms to  the  case  under consideration. . This  procedirre is open to objection as  constituting a kind of privilegium  and as being, at any  rate in form,  a clumsy  method of meeting  the difficulty.   It has,  however, substantial advantages in that it involves publicity  and enables the  central  department to keep in touch with  the matter.   The  clause  secures  the  same  result  by  means  of i simpler  procedure.   Clause 63 takes the  place of Section 158 of the  Act of 1875.   The original language  has been  altered  so as to make it clear that the duty  of the local authority is  to  pass  the plans of  proposed  buildings  which conform with the byelaws,  subject to the qualification that under certain other provisions of the Bill  (see Clauses 25, 37, 42,  52, 53, 54 and 58) the  authority must reject the plans if their  requirements, e.g.  in tUie  matter of  drains, are not complied with.  The  words &quot; approval or disapproval &quot;  of the intended work, which  appear in Section 158,  lend  some countenance  to the common misconception that local  authorities  have  a discretion  to approve proposals or not as they  think fit.  The proviso to the subsection secures that the passing  of a plan will not  be regarded as an approval or consent for other purposes.   We believe  that this  will help to avoid  the misunderstandings which not uncommonly  arise  under the existing  law.  Under  paragraph (ii) of- subsection  (2)  a local  authority  are required to  give  notice of the limited effect  of their passing of the plans under  the Act.   Subsection (3), which enables a dispute  whether the proposed  work  would contravene a byelaw  or not to be determined by a court of summary juris- diction, is new.    We regard  it as of importance from the point of vie&apos; both of local authorities and owners  that it should  be  made possible to Obtain  a  decision  on  this point speedily  and without the  necessity to the authority to take some action which may eventually be  held to amouai to a trespass.   Under Clause 66 a somewhat wider jurisdiction is conferred on the Minister but  only  with the consent of both  parties.   Section 158 requires  the  authority  to signify  their  approval or dis- approval  within one  month  after the  plans have been submitted.  It !*
been  brought to&apos; our notice  that this time  limit frequently creates an awkward situation in the case of councils who meet at monthly  intervals,since  plans may be deposited at  so  short an interval before the meetingof the council that it is not practicable to put them before  the council at that meeting and more than  a month  from the  date of deposit willelapse  before  the next.   While fully appreciating the  importance of nothampering  development   by any  substantial  extension of this period, wehave provided in  subsection (4) that a slight extension may be permitted by byelaw  to meet this particular difficulty.  Subsection  (5) reproduces Section 16 of the Act of 1907 but modifies thesection by  enabling byelaws to require the submission of plans in duplicate.This is a  common  local  Act provision and,  by saving  the additional timeand expense involved in copying  plans  as compared with  preparing an extra  copy  in the  first instance, is of advantage both to the building ownerand to the ratepayers as  a whole.  Clause  64.  The existing Iawi  with regard  to  the&apos;  pulling  down  ofcontravening buildings and works is unsatisfactory  in two respects. UnderSection 158 the authority  is not  at  liberty to pull  down a contraveningwork,  if the plans  have  been approved or if notice.of disapproval was not given  within  one month  from the deposit  of the plans.  On the other hand,under Section 157  the byelaws  themselves  may provide  for the pulling  down of contravening  works and  that section contains no such time limit.  thus the protection to owners given by Section 158 can be rendered nugatory bythe byelaws.   Moreover,  irrespective of the  action of the local  authority in approving or delaying to disapprove a plan,  there is  nothing to preventthe Attorney-General on the  relation of an interested party taking  pro-ceedings to enforce compliance with  the  byelaw by way of mandatory in-junction.   It is  clearly not in the public interest that a building whichseriously contravenes the  byelaws  should be for ever secured against demolition-tion owing to  some  mistaken  action or  inaction  of  the local authority; and it is  not less clear  that  an  owner  whose plans had been passed or bad not been rejected within the  prescribed period  would have a legitimate grievance if he  found himself  compelled  to  demolish the  building without compensation.  A further difficulty of  the existing law lies in  the fact  that the remedy provided  by Section  158  is for  the authority themselves to  pull.down a contravening work.   It follows that, if they proceed  mistakenly, they are liable  to  an  action  for  trespass,  and have  no opportunity  of testing in advance the question whether  there is in fact a  contravention of  the  bye- laws.   The Departmental  Committee on  Building  Byelaws draw  attention to this point  in paragraph 40 of their Report.  In order to meet these  difficulties the clause  has been framed on the following lines :        (1) In  place  of  the local  authority having power to  pull down or    alter the contravening work themselves, they  are enabled  to give notice    to  the  owner  requiring him  to do so.      (2)  Subsection (1) further provides that the power to require demolition-    tion or alteration is not to be  exercised after the expiration  of twelve    months from the  completion of  the  work, and  that it  must not be    exercised at all if the  plans were  passed (or  not  rejected within the    prescribed period) and if  the  work  has been  executed  in accordance    with  the plans.      (3) Subsection  (2)  preserves  the  right of  a  local authority to take    action  under  any one  of  the. various clauses  mentioned in  the note    on Clause 63 above,  under which they have  power to reject  plans  if    their requirements are  not complied  rwith.      (4)  Subsection (3) on  the other  hand preserves the right, of the local    authority or of other interested parties under the general law to apply    for a mandatory  injunction for the removal or alteration of the work,
    but  empowers the  court to order  the local authority  to compensate    the owner, if his plans were passed (or not rejected within the prescribed    period) and the  work conforms with the plans.  Clause  66. The general  effect  of  this  clause is to  secure that wherea question arises  between the local authority and the building owner as towhether  the plans conform with the byelaws, or the work has been executedin accordance with  the plans,  the parties  may jointly  submit the question for the  determination  of  the  Minister.   The  usual provision is  insertedempowering the Minister to state  a case for the opinion of  the court and enabling either party to apply to the court for a direction  to the Ministerto do so.  This clause,  which is not in the existing law, was recommendedby the Departmental Committee in paragraph  40 of their Report,  and will,we believe, be welcomed.  Clause 67. See paragraph  68  of  the Report.  Clause  69.  It  is  a  matter  of  frequent complaint that  whereas localauthorities are required to  print  their byelaws and place  them  on  sale,there is  no corresponding obligation as regards  provisions of the nature oilbyelaws  in local  Acts,  and  consequently  that in  areas in  which a largenumber  of unconsolidated local Acts are  in  operation, a building ownerand his  advisers have  no  ready  means  of  ascertaining the nature an)extent of  their obligations.  We think that there is substance in  this con-plaint and that it is not unreasonable that local authorities should be requiredto  append to their  printed byelaws the  relevant  sections  of local Acts.The clause accordingly  makes provision for this  and empowers the Ministerto  determine the  question whether any particular section  of a  local idought to be so appended.  The clause  also requires       (a) every rural district council to append a  statement of any nrbn    powers in force within the  district; and      (&amp;) every local authority to append  a statement whether, and, if so.    at what date, certain provisions of the Public  Health Acts  came into    operation within their area.  It will be seen from Clauses 25 (3), 5S (51    and 65 (2)  that the date on which each of these provisions  came into    operation affects the powers of the local authority  and the consequent    obligations  of owners under the Bill.   Clause 71.   On the  question of  &quot;house  refuse&quot;  see  paragraphs 77-:of the Report.   Subsection  (1)  reproduces  a part  of Section  42  of the Act of 1875.  Tlipart  of  that section relating  to the cleansing  of  streets is reproduced iClause  76, and   the provisions enabling  the  local  authority to  sell tkrefuse collected appear in a generalised form  in Clause 273.   The prove to  the last paragraph,  of  Section  42 is replaced  by  Subsection  (3) (e)&apos;this clause which enables byelaws to be made prohibiting the removal of a&quot;:matter by the owner, unless he intends it  for sale or his own use and tepjit so  as not to be  a nuisance.  Paragraphs  (b) and (c) of the  same si!section reproduce provisions common in local Acts.   Clause 72 replaces Section  48  of  the  Act  of 1907  but enables a Wauthority instead of adopting the section as a whole, to undertake to rei&quot;1&quot;either all trade  refuse or any specified kind of such  refuse.  The ctajjjalso makes it clear that a local authority  may as a matter of policy dewto bear the whole  or part  of  the expense of  the  removal  of trade reKthemselves.  As regards &quot; trade refuse &quot; see paragraphs 77-8 of the Eep&quot;1   Clause 73 enables  a  local authority  by  agreement  with  the occupier&apos;premises (1) to remove refuse  or cleanse cesspools,  etc. in a  case where iauthority have  not  undertaken  these  obligations  under  Clauses p- 172 and  (2)  in a ease where  they have  undertaken such  obligations,
    but  empowers the  court to order  the local  authority  to  compensate    the owner, if his plans were passed (or not rejected within the prescribed    period) and the  work conforms with the plans.  Clause  66. The general  effect  of  this  clause  is  to secure  that wherea question arises  between the local authority and the building  owner as tewhether  the plans conform with the byelaws, or the work has been  executedin accordance with the plans, the parties  may jointly submit the question for the  determination  of the. Minister.   The  usual  provision is  insertedempowering the Minister to state  a case for the  opinion of the court and enabling either party to apply to the court for a direction  to  the  Ministerto do so.  This clause,  which is not in the existing law,  was recommeby the Departmental Committee in paragraph  40  of their Report,  andwe believe, be welcomed.  Clause 67. See  paragraph  68 of  the Report.  Clause  69.  It  is  a  matter  of   frequent  complaint  that whereas localauthorities are required  to print  their byelaws  and  place them  on sale,there, is  no corresponding obligation as regards provisions of the nature olbyelaws  in local  Acts,  and consequently  that in areas  in which  a largenumber  of unconsolidated  local Acts  are  in  operation,  a building cwnttand his  advisers  have  no  ready  means  of  ascertaining the  natureextent of their obligations.  We think that there is  substance in this (plaint and that it is not unreasonable that local authorities should be require!to  append to their printed byelaws  the  relevant sections of  local AcfeThe clause accordingly makes provision for this and empowers the Ministsto  determine the question  whether any particular section  of  a local Asought to he so appended.  The clause  also requires       (a) every rural district council to append a statement of any urbiil    powers in force  within the district; and      (b) every local authority to  append  a statement whether, and.  if so,    at what date, certain provisions  of the Public Health Acts came into    operation within their area. It will be seen from  Clauses 25 (3), 58 (a).    and 65 (2)  that the date  on which each of these  provisions came ink    operation affects the powers of the local authority and the consequeil    obligations of owners under the Bill.  Clause  71.   On the  question of  &quot; house refuse &quot;  see  paragraphs 7HJof the Report.   Subsection  (1)  reproduces a part of Section 42 of the  Act of 1875.part  of  that  section relating  to. the cleansing of streets  is  reproduced iClause  76, and   the provisions enabling  the local  authority  to   sell illrefuse collected appear in a generalised form  in  Clause  273.   The provisfto  the  last paragraph  of Section 42 is replaced by  Subsection  (3) (c)this clause which  enables byelaws to be made prohibiting the removal of atfmatter by the owner, unless he intends it for sale or his own use andit so as  not  to  be  a nuisance.  Paragraphs (b)  and  (c) of the same saljsection reproduce provisions common in local  Acts.   Clause  72 replaces Section  48  of the Act  of  1907 but enables a lealauthority  instead of adopting the section as a whole, to undertake to reinojeither all trade  refuse  or  any specified kind  of  such refuse.  The ctasfalso makes it clear that a local authority  may as a matter of policy tieto  bear  the whole or part  of  the expense of the removal  of  trade rensthemselves.  As regards  &quot; trade Tefuse &quot; see paragraphs 77-8 of the Report   Clause  73 enables a  local authority by  agreement  with  the occupier&apos;premises  (1) to remove refuse  or cleanse cesspools, etc. in a case where&quot;authority  have  not  undertaken  these obligations  under  Clauses  71 *72  and  (2)  in a case  where they  have  undertaken  such  obligations,
JfP                                  g5   carry out the  task  at more frequent intervals than  they are  under  any   leo-al obligation to  do,  and  in  either1 case  to make a  charge.   Reference   may  be made to Whitlread and Co., Ltd. v.  The Staines B.D.G.  [1925]   Oh.&apos; 89.     Clause  74  follows the  general line of  numerous local Act  provisions.   Subsections (1)  and  (2) enable a  local authority who remove refuse to require   the provision of proper dustbins, subject to the right of any person aggrieved   by the requirement to appeal to  a court of summary jurisdiction.     Subsection  (3)  provides an  alternative  course  of  action.   Following  a   number of local Act precedents  it enables the  local authority  themselves to   provide and maintain  dustbins  and  make  an annual charge not exceeding   2s. 6d.  for each dust bin.     Clause 75  reproduces Section  45 of the Act of 1875,  but makes it clear   that  a local  authority can provide refuse destructors or  other  apparatus for   treating or disposing of refuse.     Clause 76.  There has always  been some doubt as to whether the  function   of  cleansing and watering streets is  a  &quot; sanitary &quot;  function or a &quot; high-   way &quot; function.   Where  a local authority  are both the sanitary authority   and the highway authority, it matters little whether they water and cleanse   streets in one capacity or the other, but since county councils have become   highway authorities in rural areas and in  respect of many roads in urban   areas the question has  become one of  some  importance.   In our opinion the   proper course is for the watering and cleansing of streets to  be  performed   by the sanitary authority subject to a contribution towards the cost thereof   by the  highway authority,  and the  clause provides  accordingly.   Any   dispute as to the amount of the  contribution  to be  made is  to  be settled   by the  Minister.     Subsection  (3) of  this clause  is new.     The provision in Section 44 of the Act of 1875 enabling  a local authority   lvho do not themselves undertake the cleansing of footways and  pavements   to make byelaws  imposing the  duty of  such cleansing  on the occupiers of   premises has been omitted as obsolete.     Clause 78 reproduces Section  49 of  the Act of 1875 except  the provision   with  regard  to  the  sale of manure,  etc.,  which  is covered by Clause 273 of    the Bill.     Following  the existing law, the clause does  not confer on  the owner  or    occupier of the premises any  express right of appeal from the decision of the    sanitary inspector, but differs from the existing law in so far as it leaves      open to the defendant if  proceedings  are taken, to challenge the reason-    ableness of the  inspectors action.     Clause 82 reproduces the combined effect  of  Section 46 of the Act of  1875    and Section 46 of the Act of 1925.  A similar  provision to Section 46 of the    Act of 1875 is to be found in Section 41 of the Metropolitan  Police Courts    Act,  1839, which applies throughout the whole of the  Metropolitan  Police    District.  There appears to be no  reason why this duplicate provision should    lemain  on the  Statute Book and the Bill  accordingly  repeals that section    (wept so far as it applies to the Administrative County of London.     Clause 83  combines Section 56 of the  Act of  1907 and  Section 45 of  the     * of 1925.  m Uause 84 reproduces Section 48 of the  Act of 1925.  Under the Cleansing   jf Persons Act, 1897, a local authority or a board of guardians were givenM8&apos;0,ve.rs  to Prov&quot;ie for the cleansing of verminous persons, but the Act of  1925ortWtovided that any local authority who adopted Section 48 of that  Act should  T&quot;* to be a local authority for the purposes of the Act of 1897. The powers    It boards of  guardians under the Act of 1897  were transferred  to county  JK &quot;j  by tht&apos; LoC&apos;al Goverilment Act, 1929.  In these circumstances we havea&quot;JR ,&apos;   1 tllls clause to county councils and the  Bill provides  for  the repeal  Wt,le Act of 1897 without re-enactment.
  That part of Section 48 (6) of the Act of 1925  which provides that anJcleansing, etc., done under the section is not to be treated as poor relief bjbeen omitted as unnecessary.  Section 5 of the Local Government Act, 192jJmakes it clear that services rendered under the Public Health Acts  are notpoor relief.  The clause enables the  sanitary  inspector  of  a local authority,  as welas the  medical officer of health, to report the  case.  Clause 86  reproduces part of Section 20 of the Act of 1890, together wit!Section 47 of the Act of 1907, but subsection  (1) of the former Section litbeen extended to sanitary  conveniences erected by a county  council.  Primto the Local Government Act, 1929, a county council had no power to ereaa convenience in a highway.  Clause 89:  Subsection  (2) follows generally the language of Section 23 (i]and (e) of the Act of 1907.    But the subsection, unlike Section 23, provide that the definition is not to govern byelaws except in so far as the  byelaiithemselves  may   provide.  This  follows  a  recommendation  made  by ftDepartmental  Committee on  Building Byelaws in paragraph 16 of  theirreport where they refer to the difficulty which arose in the case of  BepkSchool  (Governors of) v.  Bepton  B.D.C.   [1918]  2 KB.  133.   We fedno doubt that the recommendation  of the Committee  in  this  matter mright and  that the  byelaws  must themselves  define  the circumstances iiwhich  any particular byelaw  dealing  with the erection of  a building is Iapply  to  some operation which  is  not erection in  the ordinary sense ithe term.  The remaining paragraphs  of  Section 23  defining other operations whidare to be regarded as the erection of a new building are sufficiently  coversby the clauses in the Bill which deal with this matter (see Cla\ises 25, 37, 4i52, 53, 54 and 58).                                  Part III.               NUISANCES AND  OFFENSIVE TRADES.  Clause 91 is based on Section 91 of the Act of 1875, together with certsiprovisions  of  the Factory  and Workshop  Act, 1901.  Part of  paragraphof Section  91, relating  to offensive ditches and watercourses, has been tranferred to the group of clauses dealing with watercourses and appears in Clac258.  The  remainder of paragraph 2, relating to offensive privies, urinalcesspools, drains and ash pits has been omitted as  unnecessary in viewiparagraph  (c) of the clause,  reproducing paragraph 4 of Section 91, andtthe provisions of Clauses  38 and 43 of  the Bill as to drains,  cesspools Bclosets.   Paragraphs 7 and 8 of Section 91, as extended by the Public Heal!(Smoke Abatement) Act, 1926, appear among the provisions relating to sir&apos;nuisances (Clause 100).  Paragraph 5 of Section 91, relating to overcrowdishas been omitted in view  of the provisions now contained in  the  HousifAct, 1935.  Paragraph  (d) is  based on Section  114 of the  Act of 1875.    That secftprovides that  where any business or manufacture causing effluvia is certifeto be a nuisance  or  injurious  to health  the local authority may malsticomplaint  to  a  court of summary jurisdiction.  Unless the court is satisfcthat the best  practicable means  are being used to avoid nuisance, the pe*:offending is liable to penalties.  This procedure, though not identical witlifeNuisance  procedure,  is  for  practical  purposes  the  same.    The  sectfhas therefore  been  replaced by  a provision making a nuisance of this nat*a  statutory  nuisance.    The saving  in Section  114 as  regards the Wpracticable means  of avoiding nuisance is reproduced in subsection (5)&apos;Clause 93.   At the  same time the provision has  been widened  to cover J&apos;as well as effluvia.
                                    m   Paragraph  (e) is based  on paragraph  6 of  Section 91 and Sections 1  (2), 2  (1) and 2 (2), of the  Factory and Workshop Act,  1901.  The paragraph applies to all  places where persons  are employed otherwise than in  domestic service, except factories to which section 1 of the Factory Act and, so far as ventilation is concerned,  shops to which the Shops Act, 1934,  apply see subsection  (2).  The  excepted factories are subject in  these matters  to  the factory code,  and ventilation in shops has  been dealt with  in the Shops Act, 1934.   The paragraph involves a slight  extension  of the law, since (a) the  &quot; effluvia  &quot; provision  probably does  not apply at present  to  &quot;  domestic factories &quot;, and (b) under the existing law the requirement as  to ventilation in  the case  of &quot; domestic  factories &quot;,  &quot; domestic  workshops &quot;,  &quot; men&apos;s workshops &quot;  and  &quot; workplaces &quot; is somewhat more  limited, since they  are only required  to be ventilated so as to render harmless  impurities generated in any process  carried on therein.  There appears no  sufficient  reason  for keeping these complicated minor distinctions, and we think that the para- graph  should  apply alike to all places,  not  being  places covered by  other codes,  where persons are  employed otherwise than in domestic service.  As regards the definition of workplace, see the  note on Clause 332.   Clause 93.   Section  96  of the Act of .1875  requires the Court  to give directions as  to the  payment of all costs  incurred  up to the time  of  the hearing or the  making of the order for  abatement.  The object of this pro- vision  is no doubt to  prevent a local authority being put to needless expense by persons  who  take no steps to comply with  the  nuisance notice until after the authority  have commenced proceedings.   Subsection (3) is  drafted so as to make it clear that the  defendant will in such a case be liable to paj&apos;  the local authority&apos;s reasonable costs.   Clause 94.   Section 98 of the Act of 1875 provides for a daily penalty  not exceeding ten  shillings for failing to obey an order to comply with a  nuisance notice, and a daily penalty not exceeding twenty shillings for knowingly andi wilfully acting contrary to an order of prohibition.  In the clause the more usual form is adopted of a  maximum fine  of five pounds for any  contravention of an order, with  a further  penalty of forty shillings for each  day on which the offence  continues after conviction.   Clause 95 reproduces the  first two paragraphs  of  Section  104 of  the Act of 1875, but  the  proviso  to the first paragraph, which provides that  the expenses that  may be recovered  from the owner are not to exceed one year&apos;s rack rent of the premises,  has been  omitted.   The cases  in which the expense of abating  a nuisance exceeds  a year&apos;s rack  rent are likely to be few,  but where  such a case does occur there seems no good reason why the excess over the year&apos;s rent  should fall on the ratepayers  as a whole rather than on  the owner in default.   The  third paragraph of the section  is omitted  for  the reason that where the person in default is the owner, Clause 284  of the  Bill makes  the sum recoverable a  charge  on the land and  the local authority can,  if necessary, recover it by  instalments  from  the owner or occupier  of the  premises  for the time being.   Clause 96.   This clause  reproduces  Section  255  of  the  Act of  1875. The last paragraph of that section provided that nothing in the section should prevent persons proceeded against from recovering contrifcaition in any case in which they would  have been  entitled  to contribution by law.  Until the passing of the recent Law Reform  (Married Women and Joint Tortfeasors) Act, 1935, the effect of  such a negative provision  was very doubtful in view of the  general principle of law against contribution  among tortfeasors.  The similar provision  of the Public Health  (London)  Act,  1891  (Section  120), meets  the point by providing  affirmatively  that where  some  only of the persons by whose  act or default any  nuisance  has been caused have been proceeded against they  shall, without prejudice  to  any  other remedy,  be  Matted to recover from the  other persons who were not proceeded against a    33141                                                             n
proportionate part of the expenses of abating the nuisance and  of any finesand costs  ordered to be ipaid  by the  court.  Subsection (3)  of the clausefollows the language of the London Act.   Clause  97.   Subsection i(2) reproduces the provision  in  Section  108  ofthe Act of 1875 extending the powers of local authorities to nuisances causedby acts or defaults committed  within the administrative county of London.The converse power for nuisance authorities in  London to take proceedings in respect of acts or defaults outside the administrative county  is unnecessaryin view of Section 14 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and has been omitted.   Clause  100.   Section 91 (7) of the  Act  of  1875 uses  the  words    anyfireplace or furnace which does not  as far as practicable consume the smokearising from  the combustible used  therein  &quot;.   The Public  Health  (SmokeAbatement) Act, 1926,  extended the definition of &quot; smoke &quot; so as to includesoot,  ash,  grit  and gritty particles.  In reproducing the earlier provision in paragraph (a) of the clause the language has been  slightly  altered.  the mechanism  for  preventing the  emission of grit and  gritty   particles  doesnot usually form part  of  the furnace.   Clause  102.   See note  on Clause 94.   In the case  of smoke nuisances,the Public  Health  (Smoke Abatement) Act, 1926, increases   the  maximumpenalties recoverable under Section  98  of the Act of 1875 from ten shillingsto forty shillings, and  from twenty  shillings to five pounds.  In view of the gravity of the offence and of  the large interests that are frequently involved,we think that  a maximum penalty of ten pounds for a  contravention of anorder, with a daily penalty of  five pounds,  would not be  excessive; and theclause so provides.   Clause 106.  Section 334 of the Act  of 1875,  which  is  one of  the  generalsaving clauses  in Part XI of the Act,  provides  that nothing  in the Act ito be construed to  extend  to mines so as to interfere with their working, nor to the smelting  of ores and  minerals, nor the treatment  of iron and othermetals.  In re Dudley Corporation  (1881) 8 Q.B.D. 86  it was held by theCourt of Appeal  that in spite of the generality of the language  of Section 334the section  applies only to nuisances.  Section 1 (1)  (e) of the Public Health (Smoke Abatement) Act, 1926, extends 1the list of processes mentioned in Section 334 of the Act of 1875  and empowers Ithe Minister  by provisional  order  to vary  the  list.    The Act of 1926 is,however, as the  name  implies,  confined  to smoke nuisances, and it appears,therefore, that whereas the processes mentioned in Section 334 (smelting,  etc.)are exempted from liability to proceedings for nuisance in general, the vsowption conferred on the processes mentioned in  the 1926 Act (re-heating, anneal-ing, etc.) relates only to proceedings on the ground of smoke  nuisance.   The reason for this  appears  to be that the exemption for smelting, etc,,has in practice always been  regarded as applying only to smoke nuisances,and in  combining Section  334 with  the provision in the Act of 1926 we have so treated it.  Accordingly the present clause exempts the various processesmentioned  in  the two Acts  from  proceedings   for smoke nuisance.   the wider exemption of mining operations from  nuisance proceedings in generalis dealt with in  Clause 107.   Clause 107.  Section  112  of  the  Act  of 1875  prohibits  the  establishment jin a borough or  urban  district without the written  consent of  the  authority Iof certain specified trades and &quot; any  other noxious or offensive trade, business Ior manufacture.&quot;  Section 51  of the Act of 1907,  where adopted, replaces!these general words by the words &quot; any other trade, business, or manufac-fture,  which the  local authority declare by order confirmed by  the Minister, Iand published in such manner as the Minister may  direct, to be  an offensive!trade.&quot;  This section has been widely  adopted  and we  have  included it in!
the Bill in preference to the 1875  provision.  We have also  added in sub-section (1) (a) the following  trades  not  mentioned in the Act of 1875  whichhave  since been  commonly included in  orders  confirmed by the Minister,namely: -      Blood  drier, fat extractor, fat melter,  glue maker, gut scraper, leather   dresser,  rag and bone dealer, size maker, and tanner.We understand that the Ministry take the view that the trade of fish fryingif properly conducted need not be offensive  but that  it requires regulationby byelaw, and we have  extended the byelaw-making  power  in Clause 109to cover this case.  The further adoptive provisions  of Section 44 of the act of 1925, enabling  consent  to be given for a limited period and defining moredoscly the establishment of a trade,  are reproduced in subsections (4) and  (6)of the clause.  The opportunity has been taken to amend the  wording slightlyso as to enable a declaration of  an offensive trade to  be made for a partonly of a district, and the maximum penalty for a continuing offence hasbeen increased from forty shillings to the more adequate figure of  five pounds. Section 7 of the 1907 Act provides  for an appeal to quarter sessions against any requirement, etc., of a local authority and against any withholding of con-sent.   On the  general question of appeals under the Bill see  paragraph  18of the Report.  Subsection (5) of this clause provides  for  an appeal to  acourt of summary jurisdiction against refusal to  consent  to the establishmentof an  offensive trade, or  against any time  limit  attached to a consent or against a refusal to extend a time limit. Clause  108.   Paragraph (6) of this  clause is  new.   It  is  designed  to afford  control over travelling trades and  businesses  which if established  onpremises would fall  within Clause  108.   Paragraph (c),  enabling byelawsto be made with respect to fish frying, is also new and will  give  a necessarymeasure of control: see note on  Clause  108. Clause 109.  See note on Clause 106.                                Part IV.                          WATER SUPPLY. Clause 111.  Under  Section  3 of the Public Health (Water) Act, 1878, itis the duty of every rural district  council to see that every occupied dwelling-house  within  their  district has within  a reasonable distance an available supply of wholesome water sufficient for the consumption and use for domestic purposes of the inmates of the house.  The section also confers certain powersupon  rural authorities to secure  the provision of  an   adequate supply  atthe cost of the owner, where the  circumstances  are  not such  as to requirethe authority themselves  to make provision  under the  Public Health  Acts.Under Section 7 of the  Act of 1878, it  is the duty of  every  rural districttonncil to take such steps  as  may  be necessary to ascertain the condition  oflie water supply  within their  district,  and  under Section  11 the Ministernay invest an urban authority with any of  the powers and duties givenky the Act to rural authorities.  There  appears to  be no reason why these provisions should  not be  made of general application   and  the clause has keen drafted  accordingly.  Clause 113.  See paragraphs 90-1 of the Report.  House 115  reproduces the  first  part of Section 55  of the  Act of 1875. &apos;he latter part of the section,  which provides that where a  local authority &quot;J pipes for the  supply  of water to any inhabitants,  the water may be wostantly laid on at such pressure as will carry the same to the top storey &apos; the highest dwelling-house supplied has  been omitted.   This  provision &apos;MS not require the water to be  laid on at  such a pressure, but is merely tabling and as such unnecessary.
  Glauses 116 and 117.  Section 51 (2) of the Act  of  1875 enables a localauthority,  with the  sanction  of the Minister of  Health, to purchase anywaterworks.  It has always been open to doubt whether this provision enablesa local authority, to acquire a right, of supplying water  beyond the limits oftheir district, or to acquire an undertaking to which  was attached an obliga-tion to furnish  such  a supply.   The difficulty has  been  surmounted in some instances by a joint purchase of the undertaking by  all the local authoritiesinto whose districts  the limits  of  supply  extend.   To  meet cases in whichjoint purchase  is not  practicable  we  have  provided  in  Clause  116 (5),following a  recommendation of the  Advisory Committee on Water  (para-graph 174 of the  Second  Report  of the  Legislation Sub-Committee),  thata local authority  proposing to acquire an undertaking the limits  of  supplyof which extend into the district  of other local  authorities shall  obtain theconsent  of each  of  those  authorities,  but  that  consent is not  to be un-reasonably withheld.  As regards subsection (2) and Clause  117,  see paragraphs  90-1 of theReport.  Subsection  (3)  provides  that a  local authority shall  not  construct any works for taking  water, unless the works are authorised by the Minister.This is new law as regards Public Health Act undertakings, but a provision on  these lines is  now usual in  local Acts,  and is  included  in the House ofLords Model Bills  and Clauses  as  amended  in 1922.  Its object is  to preventworks being done to  the prejudice of the water supply of another area, e.g.,by  digging wells  and thus  affecting other  sources of  supply.   We considerthat this  measure of control  should now  extend to  the  local authoritiessupplying water under the Public Health  Acts.  A difficulty  has been  brought  to  our  notice  where a  local  authority have  acquired  an  undertaking  operated  under  an   order  made  underthe Gas  and Water Works Facilities  Acts,  1870  and  1873,  and wish tosecure the amendment  of the  order.  Local  authorities are not empoweredto  apply  for   amending  orders under those  Acts, which relate only toundertakings promoted by companies and persons,  and as a consequence theironly course is to adopt the  expensive procedure of a local Act.  It is clearlyreasonable that in this matter the acquiring authority should  be  in thesame position as the  original undertakers and we have accordingly inserteda  provision  in  subsection  (6),  Clause 116,  enabling   them to  apply forthe necessary order.  Clause 118 reproduces Section 53 of the Act of 1875 as  amended by Set-tion 78  of the  Act of 1925, but has been assimilated to other provisions ofthe Bill by specifying the  particulars to be included in the notices requiredto  be given  under the clause.  The provisions  in Section 53 empowering  the Department to appoint anilinspector  to  hold a  local  inquiry are unnecessary  in  view of Section 290 1of  the Local Government Act,  1933, and have been omitted.               i,  We considered the  question  whether the  recent  Reservoirs  (Safety Pro- Ivisions) Act, 1930, ought  to be regarded  as in  any  way  superseding Sec- 1tion 53.  In view, however, of the fact that that Act is limited to reservoirs Iholding more than five million gallons of water and is concerned only with Imatters of safety, we came to the  conclusion that the provisions  of  Section S3 Iare still necessary.                                                       I  Clause 120 reproduces Section  57  of  the Act -of  1875 with the  following 1 amendments of detail:                                                   I       (a) Sections 28-34 of the Act of 1847, with  respect (where  the local I     authority have  not the control of the  streets) to the breaking up o&apos; I     streets for the  purpose of laying pipes, are not  incorporated  in ti*B     clause in view of Clause 276 of the Bill:  see paragraph  19 of the Report. B       (6)  Section  57 of the Act of 1847 and Section 15 of the  Act of lfM     are replaced  by the general provision  on powers  of entry  in Part M&apos;t     (Clause  280)  and are therefore not incorporated;                    K
      (c) Section 72 of the Act of 1847 is not incorporated under this clause.    It is frequently extended by local Acts, and as thus  extended,  is repro-    duced in Clause 129.  Clause 121.   See paragraph 20 of the Report.  Clause 123  is  new.   It has  been  a  matter of  doubt  whether  a  local authority have power under the Public Health Acts to guarantee payment to persons supplying water  as  a  consideration for  the. provision of a water supply.  Express power for this purpose  has been conferred in a number of local Acts, and the clause follows  these precedents.  Clause 124.   Under  Section  64 of the Act  of  1875,  all existing  public cisterns, etc., used for the gratuitous supply of water to the inhabitants of the district,  vest  in and are under  the  control of the local authority.   The meaning of the word &quot; existing &quot;  in this  context is not free from doubt,  and it has been omitted from the clause.  The claiise  slightly  extends the existing law (1) by  making  it clear  that where the local authority are satisfied that the  water  obtained from  any such works is  polluted  and that it  is not  reasonably practicable to remedy the pollution,  they may  close those works, or restrict  their  use,  without substituting  other works;  and  (2) by dealing  with  the  case of  wells,  etc., which though not polluted are no longer required.  Clause 125  reproduces part of  Section 8 of  the L.G.  Act, 1894.  In  the proviso to subsection  (1) words have been added to avoid any conflict in jurisdiction with the powers of a local authority under Clause 124.   Cla.use 126.  Under Section 77  of the Local Government Act, 1929, where the gross value or  net annual value of any premises supplied  with water is not entered in the valuation list,  that value is to be determined by  &quot; two justices  of  the peace  in  like  manner  as  disputes are  determined under Section 68 of the Waterworks Clauses Act,  1847.&quot;  The Waterworks Clauses  Acts, however, as  incorporated in the Public Health Acts, provide for the  substitution  of a  court of summary  jurisdiction for  the  reference to  two  justices in the Waterworks Clauses  Act,  1847.  &quot;  A court of summary juris-J diction &quot; has  therefore been substituted for &quot; two  justices of the peace &quot;H in subsection (1).I  Section 56 of the Act of 1875 confers a wide discretion on local authoritiesI as to the charges to be levied for water supplied.  In recent years, however,1 it has been the  practice  of  Parliament not to  allow in local  Acts  extra1 charges by way  of water rate on a house for the  first water-closet or theI first  bath  (other  than  a  bath  of an  unusually large  capacity).   following  these precedents subsection (3) enables extra charges to he made for the useI  of water in any water-closet beyond  the first, or in any fixed bath beyond theI  first  or having a  capacity  greater  than fifty  gallons.  The subsection  also  authorises extra charges  to be made  for the use  of water for horses or forI Hashing  vehicles where  a hose-pipe of  similar  apparatus is used.    ThisI provision,  which  was recommended by  the Advisory Committee on Water,,&apos;l &apos;&apos;so has received the approval of Parliament  in  local Acts.   Section  10 of  the Public Health (Water) Act,  1878, makes  it incumbentI &apos;n a local authority  to charge water rates on the application of any tenI ratepayers in an  urban  district or any five  ratepayers in a contributoryvl place of a rural district.   The Advisory  Committee on Water,  in paragraph  183 of the Second Report of the  Legislation Sub-Committee, pointed out  that this provision was defective in that it does  not ensure that any water   rates so levied are adequate in amount,  and recommended that the Minister   should be empowered  on the application of ratepayers,  to make such order   m the matter as  appears to  be  reasonable.  Subsection (4)  gives  effect   to this recommendation by  empowering aggrieved  ratepayers to  appeal  to   fte Minister either against the refusal of the local  authority  to make  such   tnarge, or against the  amount  of the charges imposed.
  Clause  127  is new.  Local Acts  commonly provide  that,  in  the absenceof agreement between the undertakers and the consumer  to  pay a  fixedquarterly sum,  the undertakers  may require that  all  water  supplied forrefrigerating  and  other similar  apparatus shall  be  taken by meter.  Itis also  commonly  provided that where  the supply  is  to  premises partlyused for trade or business, or where the use of the premises is not whollyfor domestic purposes, the undertakers may require similarly that the supplyshall be taken by  meter.  In these  cases the local  Acts fix the maximumcharges  for such  supplies  by meter.  It is not  possible in  a  general act of this  nature to fix meter charges in view of the widely  varying costs ofsupply.   The  clause, therefore, provides  that  the undertakers  may requirethe whole supplies to be  supplied by meter, on the lines of the local  Acts, butonly if  the  Minister has, on their  application, fixed  the maximum charges to be made for such  supplies.  Clause  128  reproduces Section 9  of  the Act  of  1878, but extends  that section  to urban authorities  and to water  supplied from a  well or cistern.The  latter  amendment   is in accordance  with  a  recommendation  of theAdvisory Committee on Water in paragraphs 22 and 31 of the Report onRural Water Supplies.  Clause 130 is new but is based on local  Acts.  Subsection (1), providing that local authorities may make water rates payable half-yearly, subject tothe safeguard that  no such instalment shall be recoverable till two monthsof the  half  year have elapsed, facilitates the joint collection of water  ratesand  other rates.   Subsection (2)  relieves  an  occupier  of  liability for therate in respect of  any period for  which  he was not in  occupation.  Underthe Waterworks  Clauses Act an outgoing  occupier  is  liable for  paymentup to the end of the quarter.  Clause 131 is also  new. By providing that any variation of the net annual value of premises shall  have  effect  so as  to  require an adjustment of water rates from the same date as applies in the case of  other rates, the clausefurther facilitates  the joint collection of these charges.  Clause 132 is also new but  is commonly allowed in  local Acts.   As regardssubsection (5),  see paragraph 68 of the Report.  Clause 133 reproduces the  second half of Section  58  of  the  Act of  1875;md confers power to test meters, etc.  The power of entry into  premises forthis purpose contained in the section is covered by Clause 280.  Clause 135 reproduces Section  60 of the  Act  of  1875, but following therecommendation of  the  Advisory Committee on Water (paragraph  76 of theSecond  Report of the Legislation  Sub-Committee) the penalty  for injuringmeters or fraudulently altering the index has been increased from  2 to  5.  Clause 136.   Subsection  (3) is  new and  follows  Section  23  of  the  GasUndertakings Act,  1934.  Clauses 137-9.  See  paragraphs 86 to 89  of the  Report.   Following therecommendation of the Advisory Committee  on Water, Clause 137 is extendedto urban areas, and provision is made for a maximum penalty of 40s. a day for a continuing offence.  Clause 140 reproduces Section  70  of the Act  of 1875, but words have  been inserted to make it clear that the clause does not  apply to wells, etc., vested in the  local authority.  Further,  in accordance with a recommendation in paragraph 188 of theSecond  Report of the Legislation Sub-Committee of the Advisory Committeeon Water, the clause has  been  widened  so  as to apply  (1) to  water  use&apos;not only for drinking or domestic  purposes but also in  the preparation offood or drink;  and (2) to cases in which water is likely to become so pollute!as to be prejudicial to health.
                                 Part V.PREVENTION,  NOTIFICATION  AND  TREATMENT   OF  DISEASE.  Clause  143 reproduces the  substance of Section 130  of  the Act  of  1875and of Section  1  of the Act of 1896.  It omits  the special reference  inSection 130  to  cholera, a reference  due to the fact that the section, whichoriginally  appeared in the Sanitary Act,  1866,  was designed  principally tomeet the  epidemics of cholera familiar in  this country in the  middle of the nineteenth century.  We  have not thought it necessary to reproduce Section 134  of the Act of1875,  a section  which came from the Diseases Prevention Act, 1855, andenabled the  Local Government  Board  to make  regulations  &quot;  whenever anypart of England  appears to be threatened  with or  is  affected  by anyformidable epidemic,  endemic or  infectious disease,&quot;  for  dealing  with  anumber of matters, including the speedy  interment of the  dead and house to house  visitation.   Though the language of the section  differs in  many respects  from  that of  Section 130, the  substance differs  but little, and regulations under  the section have  not been made for many years.  Paragraphs (b) and (c)  of Subsection (1) have been  drafted  so as to make clear what we  believe to be  the intention and  effect of Section 1 of  thePublic Health  Act,  1904,  namely that  the  words  &quot; so   far  as   may  benecessary  or expedient for the  purpose of carrying  out any treaty, con-vention, arrangement, or  engagement with  any foreign  country &quot;  qualifyand limit  the regulation-making power so  far as regards the  prevention of the conveyance of infection by  means  of vessels sailing  from  any port, but not so far as regards vessels arriving  at  any port.   If the section  is  read in this sense, it virtually supersedes Section 234 of the Customs Consolida- tion Act,  1876,  a section  which  enables the  Minister to make  orders  de- taming persons on board ships which come from foreign ports where he  has reason to think that yellow  fever or other  highly  infectious distemper prevails.   We understand that no orders have been made under this section for many  j7ears, and it  is accordingly repealed  without re-enactment.  Subsection (3) reproduces certain provisions of the Act of 1913.  Section 61 (1) of  the  Act of 1925 (a &quot; removal  of  doubts &quot;  section) is repealed  without re-enactment on the  ground  that since  the Local  Government  Act, 1929, the power of  a county  council  to  provide hospital  accommodation is  un- loubted.   Section  (2) of that  section is  reproduced  in Clause 186 of  the Bill.   The proviso to Section 1 of the Act  of 1913, which  requires  the Minister, except in  case of  emergency,  to obtain  the  consent  of   each   county council before  requiring it  to  enforce  regulations  under  the  Act,  has keen  omitted.   In  view  of the health  functions   conferred on   county councils by  the  Local Government  Act, 1929, there is no  good ground for  distinguishing between these  councils  and other health  authorities  in this  respect.   We understand that,  except in  case of  emergency,  it is  the in-  variable practice of the Department  to  consult the  various  local  govern-  lent  associations  with  regard  to proposed regulations  affecting  their  constituent  authorities.   In connection with this clause it  should  be  noted that Section 138 of the  Jet of 1875 is  repealed without re-enactment.  This section provides for  Ike recovery from shipowners of charges made by  poor law medical officers  Mel other doctors who attend  patients on board  ship  in  compliance with  &quot;gulations made under  Section  130 of the same Act.   We  understand that  &apos;ke section has for long been a  dead letter.   The clause extends the existing  law by enabling  the Minister  to  take  *Ps  to prevent the  spread  of  disease by  aircraft  as  well as  by ships, and  ikns to give effect to the provisions of the International Sanitary  Conven-   kon for  Aerial Navigation  which  was signed on  behalf of  His  Majesty&apos;s   Vrnment in April, 1933.
   Regulations made under this clause  extend to  London and  provision ismade  for enabling  regulations to  be  made  to  have effect  in NorthernIreland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.   Clause  144. Section 4 (3)  of the Infectious  Disease (Notification)  Act,1889, which provides that where there  are two  or more  medical officers ofhealth&apos; a  certificate under the Act is to be sent to the officer in charge ofthe  area in  which  the patient  is  or  to  such  other  officer  as the  localauthority may direct  has not been  reproduced in  this clause.   Only rural district councils are permitted to appoint  two or  more  medical officers ofhealth  and  with  the  increasing replacement of  part-time by  whole-timeofficers, the case of more than one medical officer is becoming a rarity.   The provisions  of Section  8  (2)  of  the  Act  with  regard to  service of notices on medical officers of  health are  reproduced in a generalised  formin Clause 279 of the draft Bill.   Clause  147  reproduces Section 7 of  the Infectious Disease (Notification)Act,  1889.  One of  the requirements of  the  section is that special noticeof any proposal to extend in  an area the list  of notifiable diseases  shall begiven to  every member of the authority fourteen clear days at least beforethe  meeting,  but  that in case of emergency  the  notice  shall be sufficientif given  three clear days before  the  meeting,  in which event  the  order shall be temporary.  It has been represented to us  that special requirementsof this kind  as to notice of  business  produce much inconvenience in  theconduct  of  local  authorities&apos;   proceedings,  and  the requirement has  been omitted  in  favour of  the ordinary procedure (now contained in Parts and III of the Third Schedule of the Local Government Act,  1933) requiringthree clear  days&apos; notice.   The clause  also  omits the  requirement  that the local   authority  shallsend a copy of the  notice to  every  registered medical practitioner who isfound to  be residing in the district  as well as to those who practise there,It is not easy  to ascertain  the names  of  those   who reside but do  notpractise  and there seems  to be no  advantage  in  sending a notice to a  non-practising doctor.   Clause  148  reproduces  Section 126 of the  Act  of 1875 (as amended bySection 62 of the  Act  of  1907) except as regards public conveyances, whichare  dealt with in  Clause 159.   For  reasons indicated  in paragraph 95 ofthe  Report it  is drafted  in terms of notifiable disease and  not,  as in  theoriginal section, in terms of dangerous infectious disease.   The words &quot; wilfully exposes himself  without proper precautions  againstspreading the disease &quot; have been replaced by  &quot; exposes other persons to therisk of infection by his presence or conduct &quot;,  and a reference to places of entertainment and  assembly has been added.  In  drafting  Clauses  148-170 of the Bill we found that  in  some of the sections  reproduced  an offence is  only committed  if  the defendant actedknowingly,  whereas  in others  this limitation does  not appear.   We coulddiscover no  good ground for the distinction and have accordingly  introduced the  element of &quot; knowledge &quot;  into all these clauses.   The change is likelyto prove to be  a slight one in practice.  Clause  152.-Subsections (1) and  (2)  of this clause  represent  Section 8of the  Act  of 1907.   Subsection  (3),  which  requires the  occupier of a building in which  there is a  person suffering from a  notifiable disease tofurnish, on request, the medical officer of health with the  name and addressof any laundry to  which articles  from  the  house are  sent,  is  conimoiin local  Acts  and  has been  added  to the clause  as a necessary ancillarjpower.  Clause 153 reproduces Section 110 of the Factory  and  Workshop Act, 19(5The  central administration of  this and  certain other provisions of  the A3was  transferred to the Minister of  Health  from  the  Home Office by J&apos;
Order In  Council  (S.R.  &amp; 0. 958y 1921)  made under the Ministry of  HealthAct, ,1919,  and the  subject  matter  of  Section 110  makes  it  more  appro-Jpriate  for publio  health than for factory legislation.   (See also  Clause 205in Part VII). Subsection  (3)  of  Section  110 has been omitted  in view  of the general power  conferred  on local  authorities by Section 85  of  the Local  Govern-ment Act,  1933,  to  appoint a  committee for any  such purpose as  in theopinion of  the  local authority would be  better regulated  and managed bymeans of a committee. The  clause as  drafted  sufficiently covers  the  cases of  scarlet fever  and small-pox  which  are specially  dealt  with in Section 109  of the  factory and Workshop  Act, 1901, and  that section has  accordingly been repealedtrithout re-enactment. Clause  154 substantially reproduces  Section 73 of the Act of 1925, withthe  following alterations :   .                       ....     (1)  The section prohibits  the sale or distribution  &quot;from any cart,    barrow  or  other vehicle used  for  the  collection of rags, bones, or    similar articles,  or  in  or from any shop  or premises used for or  in  con-    nection with  the business of  a rag and  bone merchant&quot;.   It has been    brought to our notice that the reference to a  cart, barrow or other    vehicle has  given  rise to  difficulties and  that  summonses have been    dismissed on  the  ground  that the actual  sale  or  distribution took    place not from  a vehicle but from  a bag which the dealer carried in    his hand and replenished from his  cart.  To  avoid this difficulty we    have  substituted the more  general  language  of the clause.      (2) The question whether the words  &quot;or  other toy&quot;  includes  such    things  as school exercise  books, pencils, children&apos;s  necklaces,  and  so    forth,  has  been  raised  and  has been the  subject of  litigation.  The    object  of the section  seems to be two-fold:-partly to prevent the sale    to  anyone  of  articles of  food,  since contaminated  food  is specially    dangerous,  and  partly  to prevent  the sale of  articles  likely  to be    bought  by  children,  for the reason  that children are naturally less    discriminating in these  matters than adults.  It is not practicable to    enumerate  exhaustively these latter  articles, and we  think that the    true  intention of  the section is  best  secured  by prohibiting  in the    circumstances  mentioned   (a)  the&apos;  sale  or  distribution  to  anyone    of articles of  food  or  drink and (b)  the sale or distribution to  a ,ehild    under  the.  age of  14  of any  article whatever.  Clause  155 reproduces Section  59. of  the  Act  of  1907 but reverses the order  of  Subsections  (4)  and  (5)  and limits the  latter subsection (now Subsection (4) of the clause) to a contravention of the foregoing provisions. It was clearly not the  intention  of the section  that a failure on the part of a local authority to cause a book to  be  disinfected should render them liable to  a prosecution as regards Section  59 (4), relating  to compensation, see the note on Clause 275.  &apos;  Clause  158 reproduces part of Section  7 of the Infectious Disease (PrevenT tion) Act, 1890.   The* maximum fine has been increased from ten pounds to twenty pounds, which corresponds with the maximum provided in Section 128 of the  Act of 1875  (Clause  157 of the  Bill),  and in the case  of a  person knowingly  making a false answer  to  a  qnestion the penalty of imprison- iient for a period not exceeding  one month  has been inserted following the similar provision in Section 129  of  the same Act (Clause 157 of the Bill).   Clauses 159 and 160 which deal with the conveyance of infectious persons  in vehicles,  replace  Section 126 (in  part)  and  Section 127 of the Act of 1875,     Sections 62  to  64 of the Act of  1907.  :  The  first  clause absolutely Prohibits  a person  suffering &apos; from  a. notifiable ^disease entering a  public    33141                                                        *      E
conveyance used for the carriage of persons at separate fares, and prohibitshis entry  into  any other  public  conveyance without previous  notice  ofthe disease to the owner or driver.  The second  absolutely  prohibits the  owner,  driver or conductor of apublic conveyance knowingly carrying an infectious person in a conveyanceused  for the carriage  of  persons at separate  fares, and  confers  on him aright to refuse  to carry an infectious passenger in other public  conveyanceswithout  a  deposit  to  cover loss  or, expenses of disinfection.   It  furtherimposes on him  a duty to give notice to the local medical officer of health and  to have the vehicle  disinfected.  Clause 161 reproduces  Section 9 (b)  of the Registration  of  Births andDeaths Act, 1927.  We  understand  that no  regulations  have as yet beenmade  under the section.  Clause  162  reproduces   Section  10 of the  Infectious  Disease  (Preven-tion)   Act,  1890.    The  earlier code relating  to  the  removal  of bodies(Section 142 of the Act  of 1875)  is repealed without re-enactment.  the reference in Section 10  of the Act  of  1890 to  the bodies  of persons whohave  died  from infectious  disease has  been omitted on  the ground that,whether the death  has occurred  from  infectious disease or  not, the realground for  ordering  the  removal  of the body is  that  of  danger  to the health of  other persons.    For similar  reasons  the reference to a periodof -48  hours after death  has been omitted.  A  reference to cremation has  been  inserted.  The clause provides  for an  order being  made  on a  certificate  of themedical officer of health and not necessarily on his  application.   This more convenient  procedure  was  adopted  in  Section  89  of the  Public   Health(London)  Act, 1891. - .  Clause 163. Section 9  of the Infectious Disease  (Prevention)  Act, 1890,uses  the  words &quot; in  order to  prevent  the  risk  of communicating atijinfectious  disease  or  of  spreading  infection &quot;.    The  words  In  italicshave  been  omitted as having the same meaning  as  &quot; spreading  infection&quot;.  Clause 166. Secton  122  of  the Act  of  1875 enables  a  local  authorityto  provide  &quot; attendance &quot;.   The  word is  omitted  here  and  !in  other similar passages in  the  Bill on the ground  that  under Part  IV of theLocal  Government  Act,  1933,  local  authorities have  a  general  power to employ the  necessary officers  and  servants.  Clause 167 represents  a  combination of  part of  Section  46  of  the act of 1875  (the remainder  of the section  being  reproduced in  Part  II ofthe Bill),  Sections  120  and 121   of  the same  Act,  Sections 5 and 6 ofthe  Infectious  Disease (Prevention)  Act,  1890, and  Section  66   of theAct  of, 1907.  On  the  question  of  the payment of compensation,   see  the  note onClause 275.   Clause 169 reproduces Section 124 of the Act of  1875,  but the languagehas been to some extent assimilated to that of Clause  172 which representatives-duces  Section  62 of the  Act of 1925 dealing, with  the removal  of  persons suffering  from   tuberculosis.   The wide distinction between  tuberculosisand other  infectious  diseases as  regards  length of  treatment)  makes iinecessary to retain  the  two  separate provisions.   Following the  existing law, the clause  differs from the provision relating  to tuberculosis  patients in not enabling  patients to be detained  under the removal  order.  Clause  170. Section 12 of  the  Infectious  Disease  (Prevention) Act,1890,  provides   that  a  justice  of the  peace  &quot; acting  in;  and   for thedistrict of the local authority &quot; may make an  order directing the detentioein hospital &quot; at the cost of the local authority &quot;  of an  infectious  patiei&apos;whose discharge might be  dangerous.   This  apparently  enables  a justice in any part of  the  country to make an order  directed  to  a patient at&apos;
to a hospital in any  other part  of  the  country.  This jurisdiction  wouldbe unsatisfactory^  if not impracticable, and the clause accordingly providesthat the justice must be  one  acting in and  for the district in which thehospital  is  situate.  It is  not  clear  under  the  original section upon what local authority the cost  is  to fall.  If  the home of  the  patient and the hospital  are inthe same district,  no difficulty  arises.  If,  as will  often  be the case, the patient  lives  in  a county and  the hospital  is in a  neighbouring  countyborough, the  application for detention may be  made either by  the  county or by the county  borough authorities.  Subsection (1) of  the  cla\ise  placesthe financial  responsibility on  the  applying  authority,  but the  provisosecures  that  this  is  not  to  affect  any  contractual arrangements  made between  the  two  councils.  Thus, if  the patient whose home  is  in thecounty is,  by arrangement, accommodated in  a hospital  belonging  to thecounty borough, the liability of  the county or district council  will continuenotwithstanding that  the  application  to the  justice is made by  the  countyborough  council.   Clause 171.  Section 1  of the Act  of 1921, which is  reproduced in  thisclause, contains  an elaborate provision  designed to secure  that arrange-appointments made with  the approval of the Minister  prior to the commencementof the Act  (including in  the  case of Wales arrangements made  with theKing  Edward VII  Welsh National Memorial Association) are to be regardedas adequate arrangements for  the purposes of the Act.   It further contains a special default power  enabling the Minister,  if not satisfied  that the arrangements in any  area  are  adequate,  to make  the  necessary arrange- ments himself and recover the  expenses  from  the council.   We are  satisfied that in view  of the time which  has  elapsed since the passing of that Act both  the  special  saving  and  the special  default  power may now be regarded as unnecessary.  Moreover the beneficent work  of the King Edward VII Welsh National Memorial Association  is so well known that it is superfluous to  state that arrangements may be  made with it under the Act.  The clause has  accordingly been  drawn in a much shorter  and simpler form than  the original section.   Clause 172 reproduces Section  62 of  the  Act of 1925, with the substitution of the  phrase  &quot;tuberculosis  of the  respiratory  tract&quot;  for &quot;pulmonary tuberculosis &quot;.  The  former  phrase   is that used  in   the  Public  Health (Prevention of  Tuberculosis)  Regulations, 1925.   Under subsection (4) of  this section, if  an  order is made for the  removal  to hospital  of a tuberculous patient,  the  local authority or county  council must  bear the  cost of his  removal and   maintenance.   Further, the local  authority or council may, and,  if required by the court,  must,  make such  contribution towards  the  maintenance of the  patienfs dependants  as the  authority or  council think fit or as the  court  may direct.   On the other  hand, under Clause 184 of the Bill a local  authority or county  council main-  taining a tuberculous patient in a hospital  or sanatorium  have power to  recover from him or the persons liable  to maintain  him,  the whole or  such part of  the  costs of  maintenance  as is treasonable in  view of  his or  their financial resources.   Thus Section  62  of the Act  of  1925  places  a  patient who is compelled to enter a hospital  in a much more favourable  position  than  one who enters  voluntarily,   since in the former  case the  iuthority are required to pay the cost of the maintenance of the patient  and may be called upon  to maintain his relatives, whereas  in the  latter  they have power to recover from  him or  his  relatives the  cost of his main-  tenance.  This  curious  situation no  doubt  arises from  the  fact  that in  framing Section 62 (which  was  based on  local  legislation) Parliament was  ^pressed  by  the  consideration  that the   patient  would  in  the  public  interest  be deprived  of  his  liberty   and  earning power,  and  accordingly  Wnsidered that the public should pay.  It seems hardly possible,  however,  to reproduce  in the  same  Bill  provisions the  joint&apos; effect  of which  is to:    33141                                                            E 2
put  at a plain  disadvantage the  person  who  recognises that  his  proper course is to  enter a  sanatorium.  . Accordingly,  in  order  to  reduce  theinconsistency,. Clause  172 is drafted so as  to  place the cost of removingand  maintaining a person who  is compelled to enter a sanatorium  on thesame footing  as  the contribution towards  the  maintenance  of dependants,that is, to leave the matter to be dealt with hy the order of  the court or,if the court  prefers not to deal with it,  to  the  discretion of the  localauthority or  county council.  Clause 174.  Section 3 of the  Public Health  (Prevention  and Treatmentof Disease)  Act, 1913,  enables,  but does not require local authorities  and county councils to  make such  arrangements as may be  sanctioned  by theMinister for  the  treatment of  tuberculosis.   We  understand  that  sincethe  replacement of the percentage grant by  the  block  grant  provided under  the Local  Government  Act,  1929,  the  Department  do  not  attach importance  to the power of sanctioning  arrangements,  and it has  accord-ingly been omitted.  The requirement of  Ministerial approval  of  institu-tions for the treatment  of  tuberculosis  is  retained  in Clause 171.  Clause 175,  which reproduces Section 7  of  the  Act  of 1921, has  beenslightly  redrafted,  as  the  governing body of  the  seamen&apos;s pension fund.constituted under  Section 64 of  the  National Health Insurance Act, 1924,as  amended  by the   National   Health Insurance  Act,  1928,  no  longercomprises representatives of  approved  societies.    It has therefore  been necessary to omit  the  provision that this governing body are  to  appoint&quot; from among their own members &quot; representatives of such societies.  Clause 176.  For the  reason indicated in  the note on Clause 174, the words&quot;with the consent of the Minister &quot;  have been omitted.  Clause  177 reproduces Section 133  of  the   Act  of  1875.    The  words&quot; or contract  with any person to provide &quot;  have been omitted  as  un-necessary in view of Section 266 of the Local Government Act,  1933.  Apartfrom this, the language of the section has  been reproduced unaltered, not-withstanding that the section, and in particular the word  &quot; temporary,&quot; has given rise to some  difficulties of interpretation.   Any  attempt to  redraft thesection would necessarily involve large problems  of medical policy.  Clause 179  reproduces  Section 67 of the Act  of  1925, a  reference tocinematograph films being  added.       *  Clause 180.  Section  59 of the Act of 1929 which is  reproduced  in thisclause does  not provide  for the  regulations  being  laid  before Parliament.For  the  reasons stated  in paragraph 15 of the Report we have inserted this requirement.Part VI.                 HOSPITALS,  NURSING HOMES, ETC.  Clause 181 reproduces Section 131 of the Act  of  1875, with  certain lateramendments  and extensions  of  that  section.  The following points shouldbe noted &apos;  (a)  The words  &quot; the inhabitants of  their district &quot; have  been replaced hya reference to  persons in the district.  The  meaning of  the  word &quot; inhahi-tant &quot; has given rise  to  a  good deal of doubt,  and  in  our  opinion the power to provide hospital accommodation  should  be  granted in terms of fpersons who are  for the time being within the district,  whether inhabitantsor not.  We believe that in general this will bring  the  law into conformitywith practice, since it is well known that  in  seaside resorts and other placeswhich at times have a large non-resident  population, no  distinction  is madein this  matter between residents  and non-residents.  We  understand thaiin a  few  areas,  notably  those  frequented by hop-pickers, some difficulties
have arisen, and that to  meet these an order has recently been made  nnderSection 130 of the  Act of 1875  (S.R.  &amp;  0.,  1934, No. 674),  the effect ofwhich  is to place residents and  non-residents on the same footing in thematter of accommodation for  infectious disease.  The present  clause  which applies to hospitals of all  kinds  carries this principle slightly  further.  Itwill not  affect the further and more important question, which we under-stand is  now  under consideration, whether  the  existing law of settlement should be altered as regards the duty of public assistance authorities to giverelief by way  of institutional treatment.  (fj)  The words  &quot; temporary  places  for the reception  of  the  sick,&quot;  whichhave given rise to a good deal of misunderstanding, have  been replaced bya reference to clinics, dispensaries and out-patient departments.  We under-stand that the view  was  adopted by the Local Government Board,  and has since  been maintained without  challenge, that  the powers of Section 131of the Act of 1875  are sufficiently wide to cover not only  hospitals in theordinary sense but also out-patient centres or clinics where persons attendfor diagnosis and  treatment.  (c) Subsection (3)  reproduces  Section  64  of the  Act of  1925,  but with-out the words :      &quot; if the local authority are satisfied that by so doing they will maintain    or extend or  increase the efficiency of hospital accommodation for the    sick inhabitants of their district.&quot;It need not be anticipated that a local authority will make a subscription,unless  they  are satisfied  that it  is advantageous  to  do so, and  the  wordshave accordingly been omitted as unnecessary.  (d)  The latter half of subsection (3) of the clause represents Section  64 (2)of the Act of 1925, as amended by Section 75 of the Local Government Act,1929.   Orders  under  the latter section must be laid before  Parliament  andare subject to  annulment by resolution.   In considering  an identical pro-vision with respect to the expenses of parish councils and  parish meetings,the Joint Select Committee on the Local Government Bill of 1933 struck outthe provision requiring orders of  this type to be  laid before Parliament onthe ground that  the  orders  were executive  rather than legislative  in character. Following this principle we have omitted the similar  requirement.  Clause  182.  Section 13 of the Local Government Act, 1929, provides that&quot; The council  of  every county or county borough shah, when  making pro-vision for hospital accommodation in discharge of the functions transferredto them under this Part  of this Act, consult such committee or other bodyas they consider to represent both the governing bodies and  the medical andsurgical staffs  of  the voluntary hospitals  providing services in or  for thebenefit of the county or county borough as to the accommodation to be pro-vided  and as to the purposes for which it is to be used.&quot;  The functionstransferred to counties and county boroughs under Part  I of the Act of1929  related to poor law,  infant  life  protection  and vaccination.   Of these functions, hospitals   are  required  for  poor  law purposes   only,  but  thesection was in fact repealed so far as it related to poor law functions, bythe Poor Law  Act,  1930, and  reproduced  in  that Act.  In these  circum-stances it appears that,  strictly speaking,  Section 13 could be repealed asspent.  Our  attention was, however,  drawn to the following  extract fromthe Circular on the  Act of  1929 issued by the Ministry  of Health in April,1929:-      &quot; The provisions of Section 13 of the Act have been designed  . .   .    to  secure  that by consultation between  the  local authorities  and  local   bodies representing voluntary hospitals the provision and use of hospital    accommodation in every area is not achieved to the accompaniment of    any unnecessary and wasteful competition between public and  voluntary    bodies .  .  .:J3Hi
       &quot;It  is  the confident  hope and expectation of the  Minister that as     procedure under Section  13 becomes  established and regular, it may     lead  to wider  arrangements for the  fullest consultation between  the     local authority  and  the medical profession, not merely in  regard to     institutional  accommodation  and its  use,  but also  in regard to those     numerous  developments  in the health provision of the  people which are     implicit in the new organisation laid down by the Act.&quot;   In view of this expression  of opinion,  we have thought it right to include in the Bill a provision requiring  consultation  with hospital  authorities whenever a local  authority  or county  council  propose  to provide  hospital accommodation,   except  where  the  accommodation  is  required  for  the treatment  of  infectious  disease.   As  voluntary  hospitals  make little or no provision for infectious diseases,  consultation in this  case appears to be unnecessary.   Clause  183 reproduces Section 65 of the Act  of  1925,  but  enlarges  it by conferring the  power on county councils  as well as on local authorities.   This is not a substantial extension of the law, since county  councils  have a general power  under Section 72 of the Housing Act, 1925, to  provide  accommodation for any of  their employees.  It may, however, be convenient in  some cases that the  accommodation should  be  provided,  not under  the  Housing Acts, but as part of  the expenses of the provision of the hospital.   Clause 184.   See paragraphs  101-3  of the Report.   Clause 189 reproduces Section  3 of the Nursing Homes Registration Act,1927, but omits from subsection  (3) the  provision with  regard to an appeal from a court of summary  jurisdiction, since the matter is dealt with in the general Part of the Bill (see Clause 293).   Clause 194 reproduces Section  9 of  the Nursing Homes Registration Act,1927, in  a somewhat amplified  form so as  to make  it clear  that if a countycouncil delegate their  powers  under the Act  to the council  of  a county district,  the powers  of  the  county medical officer of health  under the Actare transferred to the medical officer of health of the district.   Clause 196.   See paragraph 104 of the Report.   Clause 197.   Under Section 123 of the Act  of 1875, local authorities areempowered  to  provide  ambulances for persons suffering from  infectious dis-orders, and to pay  the expense  of conveying such  persons to a hospital orother destination.  Section 50  of the  Act  of 1907, enables  a local authorityto provide an  ambulance for  use in the case of accidents  or other sudden or urgent disability, and to  allow it to be used by other local  authorities or persons on  terms to be agreed.  Section 13 of the Isolation  Hospitals Act, 1893, requires  an isolation hospital to be provided with an  ambulance  for conveying patients to the hospital.   Section 63 of  the Act of 1925, enables ambulances  provided either under the Act of 1875  or the Act of  1893 to be used for the conveyance of persons discharged from a hospital, and  also  forthe conveyance of sick persons  not suffering from infectious  disease,  and enables reasonable charges to be made for their use for these purposes.  This clause replaces these provisions with a power in general  terms and  extends it to county councils.   Clause  198.    Under Section 141  of the Act  of 1875, a local  authority may, and if required by the Minister of Health  shall, provide  and fit up a mortuary,  and may make byelaws  with respect to  the  management,  and charges for  the use,  of the mortuary.  They are also empowered  to provide for the decent and  economical  interment of any dead body received in the mortuary.   Under Section  143 of the Act of 1875 a local authority may provide a proper place (otherwise than at  a workhouse or  at a mortuary) for the re- ception of dead  bodies  during  the time required to conduct  a post-mortem examination ordered by a coroner or other duly constituted  authority, andmay make regulations with respect  to the  management  of  such, place.
 As regards mortuaries, section 42 of the Burial Act, 1852, provides that &quot;&quot; It shall he lawful for any  burial board, with the  approval of the  vestry,and subject to the provisions of this  Act and the regulations to be made there under, and  for  the churchwardens and overseers  of  the poor  of  anyparish  .   .  .  for which  a burial board shall  not have been  appointed under  this Act, by the  direction of  the vestry and  subject as aforesaid, tohire, take  on lease, or otherwise to  provide fit and  proper places in whichbodies  may  be  received  and taken care  of previously to interment,  and tonake arrangements for the reception and care of the bodies to be depositedtherein.&quot;     The  operation of this  section was  extended throughout  thecountry by section  7 of the Burial  Act, 1853. In many urban areas,  the  borough  or  district  council are the  burialboard,  and in rural parishes  having  a parish council the parish council arethe burial  board.   Moreover,  under the Overseers Order, 1927, the  powersof the churchwardens  and overseers under section  42 of the Act of 1852irere transferred to the rating authority in urban areas, and to the parishcouncil in  rural  parishes having a parish council. It will be seen therefore that mortuaries  can be provided      (a) in  boroughs  and  urban  districts,  by  the  borough  or district   council either (i) under the Public Health Acts, or (ii) as burial board   under  the Burial Acts,  or (iii) as  rating authority under the  Burial   Acts,  if there is no burial board for the borough;     (b) in rural districts, by the district council under the  Public  Health   Acts;     (a) in rural parishes having a parish council, by the  parish  council   either  as  burial  board  or as successors  to  the  overseers under  the   Burial Acts;     (d) in rural parishes not having a parish council, by the burial board   under  the  Burial Acts. This clause, so far as  it relates to  mortuaries, amalgamates the provisionsof the  Act of 1875 and  those of the  Burial Act,  1852, by enabling  a localauthority  or a parish council  to provide  a mortuary,  and requiring them o do  so,  if directed by the  Minister  of  Health.   Section 42  of the  BurialAct, 1852,  will remain in  force for  elected  burial boards only. As regards  post-mortem  rooms,  the clause reproduces section 143 of  theAct of 1875,  subject to  the following alterations:  -     (a) a power to provide a post-mortem room is conferred on a parish   council;      (b) the  local  authority  or  parish  council  may  be  required by  the   Minister of Health to provide  a post-mortem room.     (c) a power to charge for the use of  a  post-mortem room is conferred;     (d) a power to make  byelaws is substituted  for a power  to make   regulations;     (e) the  words  &quot; otherwise  than  at  a workhouse or mortuary &quot;  are   omitted.  The most convenient  place for  a post-mortem  room is at a   mortuary,  and provided  that the  room  is properly separated from  the   rest of the mortuary there appears to be no good reason  why it should   not form  part of the  same building.                               Part VII.Notification of Births;  Maternity and Child Welfare and Child Life                             Protection. Clause 200.  See paragraph 106 of  the  Report.  The provisions in Section60 of the Local Government Act, 1929, with regard to  transfer of propertylid liabilities, and transfer, superannuation and compensation of officers arelot reproduced in  the clause as they  are  covered  by general  provisions(Clauses 312 and 313) in Part XII of the Bill.  33141                                                           E 4
   Clause 201.  See paragraph 28 of the Beport.   Clause 202.  See paragraph 108 of  the Report.   Clause 203.  Under Section 1 (2) of the Notification of Births (Extension)Act, 1915, a district medical officer of health  is required to send duplicatesof notices to the county  medical officer  of health only in cases where  the notification  of  Births Act, 1907, came  into force by virtue of the Act of1915.  Thus, medical  officers of health of county districts which had volun-voluntarily  adopted the earlier Act were  exempted from  this duty.  [We under-stand  that  there  are  about  60 cases  to  which  this  exemption  applies.Whatever  the ground for inserting this exemption may have  been in 1915,we are clear that at  the  present day it would  be unfortunate to maintain an arbitrary distinction between authorities which adopted the earlier  Actvoluntarily,  and those which did not, and  accordingly subsection (6) of  theclause which re-enacts Section 1 (2)  of  the Act of 1915  omits the limitingwords  and imposes the duty on the medical officer of  heaitb of every county district.   Clause 204.  The combination of Section 2 (1)  of the Notification of Births(Extension) Act, 1915, and Section  1 of the  Maternity and  Child AVelfareAct,  1918, presents   some difficulty.   Under the earlier section  a  localauthority is  empowered, for  the purpose of the care of expectant mothers,nursing mothers and young children, to exercise  any powers which a sanitaryauthority has under the Public Health Acts, 1875  to  1907.  Under the latersection a  local authority is empowered to make such arrangements  as maybe  sanctioned  by the Minister  for  attending to  the  health  of expectant mothers and nursing  mothers,  and children who have not  attained the  ageof five years and are not being educated in schools recognised by the Board ofEducation.   The earlier section  uses  the word  &quot;  care &quot;, which  appears  tobe  wider  than  &quot; health &quot; in  the  later  section,  but limits  the power  by reference  to the powers of the  Public  Health  Acts. Further,  the earliersection, unlike the later,  does  not require  any sanction  or approval on  thepart of the Minister.  We understand  that Section  2 (1) was inserted in  ;he Act of 1915 mainly to enable, local authorities to exercise the powers of the Public Health Actsfor providing premdses for maternity work, and for  that purpose  acquiringland, borrowing money, etc.  The Act of 1918  which confers a general powerto make such arrangements as may he sanctioned by the Minister is probablyw-ide enough for these purposes, and  accordingly if it were not  for  the  nseof the word &quot; care &quot; the  section might safely  be repealed without repro-duction.  We understand, however,  that  a good  deal  of importance  hasbeen attached to the distinction between this word  and the word &quot; health&quot;,and that  for that reason  the mere repeal of the section  might give rise to difficulties.  It has  also been  brought  to our  notice  that since the abolition of  thepercentage grants for maternity and child  welfare work and  their replace-ment by the block grant  provided under the Local  Government Act,  1929.the policy of the Ministry has been to relax the  minute control of maternity and child welfare arrangements which  had previously been  in operation,To meet these points  we have  redrafted the provisions by  omitting section  (1)  of  the Act of  1915 as  a separate  power  and slightly  altering  the language of the Act  of 1918 so  as to empower  a  local authority or countycouncil,  subject  to  the  general approval  of the  Minister,  to  make suckarrangements  as  they  think  fit for the  care  of expectant and  nursing mothers and of the children  referred to  in  that  Act.   Section  59 of the Act of 1929&apos; which is reproduced  in this clause does  not provide for  the regulations being laid before  Parliament.  For  the reasonsstated in paragraph 15 of the  Report we have inserted this requirement.   Clause  205 reproduces Section 61 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901.The central  administration of this provision was transferred to the  Ministrjof Health from the  Home  Office by  an  Order  in  Council (S.R. &amp;  0. 958,
1921) made under the  Ministry of Health Act, 1919, and  its subject  matterEiakes it more appropriate for public  health  than for factory legislation.(See also Clause 153 in Part V.)  In incorporating the provision in  the Bill the opportunity has been takento substitute a maximum for a minimum  penalty in respect of a  secondoffence,  while the distinction  between  offences committed during the  day and during the night has been abandoned.  Clause 206  reproduces Section 1 of the Children Act, 1908,  and Section 65of the Children and Young Persons Act, 1932.  The preceding  clauses in this Part dealing  with  maternity and  child welfare relate to mothers and to children under five.  This and the followingclauses reproduce provisions of the Children Acts,  1908 and 1932, which arein terms of  infant  life protection though they apply  to persons under theago of nine.   In reproducing them in the Bill &quot; child &quot; has been substitutedfor &quot; infant &quot;.  The provision that it  shall  he a good defence  against a charge of  failure to give  the  required notice to prove that  the child was  received  upon anemergency and that  notice was given within twelve  hours thereafter hasbeen amended so as to allow  of such emergency notices being given within twenty-four  hoiirs.  Our attention was called to the fact that occasionally  children  to whomthis Part of the Bill applies are lodged in one house by day and in anotherby night,  and that  doubts  have been expressed  whether  under the present law the notice must state the address  of both premises.   Subsection (2) of the clause introduces words to make this point clear.   Clause 209.  Section  2 (3)  of  the Children Act, 1908, which  empowers welfare  authorities to  combine, has  been  omitted  as  being  unnecessary in view of  the general powers  conferred by section 91 of the  Local Government  Act, 1933, and by Clause 270 of the Bill.   Clause 215.  The section reproduced in this  clause makes it an offence to  advertise  that a person will  undertake the nursing and  maintenance  of a  child  under  9  years  of  age without publishing  the advertisers name and  residence. It has been brought to our notice  that the section can be and some-  times is evaded by the publication of advertisements  which indicate  plainly  enough that  the advertiser keeps a home of the kind at which the section is  aimed but do  not in terms  mention the  age of the children.   We  have  accordingly omitted the italicised words. The effect will be slightly to widen  the section,  but the requirement that the advertiser shall publish his name  and address  is not  an onerous one,   even in the case of a home intended to  receive older children.   KfTO.se 216.  The provision in section 8 of the Act  of 1908  specifying  the manner  in which notice is to be given to a welfare authority is omitted  in view of the general provision with regard to notices to local authorities  in section 286 of  the Local Government  Act, 1933.  In  the  case of  notice  to a  coroner the obligation  to send notice  by registered letter has been  replaced in  the general Clause 279   by  an  obligation  to send it by prepaid   etter.  This  accords with the procedure of section 286.   Clause 217.   Section  98 (1) of the Children  and  Young Persons  Act,   1933,  enables proceedings to be taken for offences under  that Act  or under   fart  I  of the Children Act,  1908,   either by  the welfare authority or the   Poor  law authority   Part I  of the  Act of  1908 is reproduced in this Part   *f the Bill,  and accordingly the subsection so far as it relates to  Part I   wrald,  on a true  consolidation,  be  reproduced here.  It  seems,  however,   &apos;hat  offences under Part I  of the  Act of  1908  are of a kind that  cannot   wnveniently  be  dealt  with  by any  authority  other   than the  welfare   authority, and for this reason the  reference to  Part  I in section 98 (1)  is   Sealed by the  Bill  without re-enactment.
  Section 9  of  the Children  Act,  1908,  provides that a  person guilty  ofan  offence under the provisions  reproduced  in  the Bill  shall he liable  to imprisonment for a term not  exceeding six months or to  a fine not exceed-ing twenty-five  pounds.  The clause, following the usual  modern  practice,provides,  as  maximum  penalty,  that  a  person  guilty of an  offence shallbe liable both to imprisonment and to a fine.  The  clause omits the  requirement that fines shall be paid to the welfareauthority. On this point see paragraph 122 of the Report.  Clause  218.   This  clause  is new.   It seems reasonable  that the welfareauthority should be  empowered  to  defray  the expenses  of  maintenanceof child removed to a place  of safety.  Clause&quot;2l9.   Paragraph   (c) excepts  from  the provisions  of this Partvoluntary homes under the Children and  Young Persons Act, 1933,  providedthat they are supported wholly or mainly  by voluntary  contributions.  Underthe  Children and Young Persons Act,  1932, the  exception extends to a voluntary home supported wholly  or partly by voluntary contributions.  Thiswas an amendment of the earlier law which provided  for  exception only ofinstitutions &quot; conducted in  good  faith for religious or charitable purposes.&quot;We understand that since  the passing of the Children and Young  persons act, 1932, instances have come to light where homes which are in fact con-ducted on a commercial  basis have  been able  to register  themselves  asvoluntary homes,  and thus escape control, by proving that  they  have receiveda  trifling number  of voluntary  contributions.   The  substitution  of  thewords &quot; or mainly &quot;  for the words of the Act of 1932  is designed to prevent this evasion.  Clause  220.   The provisions in the Bill relating to  child life protectionhave been amended by bringing within the definition of &quot; relative &quot; personswho are relatives by  adoption under  the Adoption  of  Children Act, 1926.Part VIII.

Under Section 24 of the Baths and Washhouses Act, 1846, thebaths authority were empowered to purchase or lease land in the area of theauthority, and under Section 27 of the same Act trustees were empowered tosell or lease to a  baths  authority baths  in the  area of the authority. TheAct  of  1882  extended these powers by inserting  the words &quot; or in theimmediate neighbourhood of &quot;.  For the reasons indicated in the note  onClause 271 references to the area of  the  authority have been omitted.  The words &quot; either open or covered &quot; have been inserted in  paragraph (i)of the clause  in order to make  it clear that open-air baths can be  providedwhether  as forming part of  a recreation ground or not; see paragraph 111of the Report.  Clause 222 reproduces Section 85 of the Public Health Act, 1925, but adopt-ing the more modern and less expensive procedure replaces an obligation to publish the proposed scale of charges in a local newspaper by an obligationto deposit it and advertise the place  where it may be inspected.  Clause 223 reproduces the  existing  byelaw-making powers for the regulationof baths and. washhouses, but slightly extends them by enabling byehws tobe made providing for the exclusion  from baths of undesirable persons. T&apos;&quot;!power is common  in local Acts  and is advisable on grounds of public hea*
  Clause 225 represents provisions common in local  Acts enabling tbe localauthority  to close baths  temporarily for the use of  clubs  and schools andfor regattas and the like, and to make charges for  admission to,  or  for theuse  of,  the baths at these times.  The local Act clauses frequently limit the periods during which the bathmay be closed to the  public, e.g.  for not more than three hours in the day.The  number of baths  belonging to different authorities,  and other  circum-stances, differ so widely that it would be unnecessarily hampering to insertany  such limit in a general Act.  Clause 226 reproduces  Section 2 of the Baths  and  Washhouses  Act, 1899,and Section 87 of the Public Health Act, 1925.  Section 3 of the former Act,which provides that in places in  which the Disorderly  Houses Act,.  1751, isin force a licence for  music or dancing under that  Act may be granted  tothe baths  authority,  is repealed  without  re-enactment.   The Act  of 1751applied only to the Cities of London and Westminster,  and to places within20 miles thereof.  The combined  effect of the Music and Dancing Licences(Middlesex) Act, 1894, Part VI of the Surrey County Council Act, 1925, andthe Home Counties (Music and  Dancing) Licensing Act, 1926, appears  tobe to repeal the licensing provisions of the Act  of  1751 except in so far  asthey relate to London itself.  In providing that swimming baths may be closed during the winter andwhen so closed may be used for  entertainments, Section 87 of the Act  of1925 restricts the type of entertainments which  may be provided by a local authority,  inter alia,  to cinematograph  films illustrative of questions  relating to health  or disease.   In reproducing this provision the phrase functions of the local authority has been substituted.  Clause 227 : See  paragraph  19  of  the Report.  Clause 229 reproduces Section 28 of  the  Baths and Washhouses Act, 1846. but  with the addition of a  reference to electricity undertakers.  Clause 230: See  paragraph  111 of the Report.  Clause 231  reproduces  provisions  of  the Towns  Police Clauses Act, 1847 (which  are  incorporated  in the public health law by  Section 171  of  the Act of 1875, as extended  by  Section 92 of the Act of 1907).  In paragraphs  (b) and (c) of the clause references to bathing huts  and tents have been added.Part  IX.                    COMMON LODGING-HOUSES. Hawse 234:  See paragraphs 114-7 of the Report. Clause 235.   Proviso (a)  of  this  clause is  new.  By continuing  for  threemonths after the commencement  of the Bill the registration of  any personregistered at that date it will allow a necessary interval for registration tobe effected under the provisions of Clause 236. Clause 237.  Subsections  (1)  and  (2)  of this  clause  combine  Section 78of the Act of 1875 and Section 69 of the Act of 1907 together with local Actextensions  of  these  sections.  Under the  earlier Act a house must  beforeregistration be inspected and  approved, and the local authority  may refuseregistration, if  the  applicant  does  not produce  a certificate of  charactersigned by three persons having a specified property qualification.  Registra-tion, if effected, continues  indefinitely during the life  of the  lodging-housekeeper, but if he is  convicted  of  a  third offence, the  court may  decide thathe is  not  to  keep a  common  lodging-house within five years without thelicence of the local  authority.
   Under  Section 69 of the later Act the local authority may  at  their dis-cretion refuse to register a person as a  common lodging-house keeper, unlesssatisfied of his character and his  fitness for the position.   The registrationremains in force for a period, not  exceeding  one year, to be  fixed by theauthority, but may be renewed.  The latter provision, however, only applies to persons newly registered &quot; after the  commencement of this section,&quot; i.e.,after  the  date  when  the section  is put in  force  in the  district.   UnderSection 72  of the same Act on a third  conviction the court may cancel the registration.   While Section 69 of the Act of 1907 placed the registration of keepers onan annual basis, it made no  change in the registration  of  the  houses; and,under the Act of 1875 these,  when once registered,  continue on the registerwithout  renewal, save  that  the  local  authority  may suspend  registrationuntil  a proper supply of water is provided.   In local Acts,  however, it  iscommonly provided  that the registration of a house  shall  be  for a  period not  exceeding  a year.   The clause  combines the  sections of  the Acts  of1875  and  1907  with these local  Act precedents.   It  also  assimilates the language  to  that  of Clauses 187  to 195 of the  Bill which  reproduce theNursing Homes Registration Act, 1927, a more modern code,  by providing forthe  registration  of  a specified  person  in  respect of  a specified commonlodging-house and enacting that this single registration  of both keeper and house  shall  be for a period not exceeding a year.   It also provides for the registration of  any deputy keeper.  Local Acts usually make it  a  condition of  registration that  the houseshall  be suitably equipped.   Sections 81 of the Act of 1875 and  74  of theAct of 1907 contain  detailed  provisions with regard to the  supply of water and to sanitary conveniences.  These latter provisions can without loss beshortened and simplified, and they are replaced by  proviso (b) (ii) to sub-section (1) of the clause.  A reference to means of escape in case of fire has been added  and for this reason common lodging houses have not been included Jin Clause 59  of  the  Bill.  Subsection  (3) which requires the  local authority to state the grounds of their refusal  to register, if  called upon to do so, follows local Act precedents [and also  corresponds with the Nursing Homes  code.  Clause 238.  No right of appeal against a refusal  to grant or  renew regis-tration is expressly  conferred by the sections in the  Acts of 1875  and 190!dealing with  this subject, but as regards the latter Act it would appear thatthe case falls under Section  7  (1) (b),  and that  an  appeal lies to a courtof quarter  sessions.   The  clause, following  the precedent  of  Section 3 (3)of the Nursing Homes Registration  Act, 1927  (Clause 189 of  the  Bill) pro-vides for  an  appeal  to a  court of  summary jurisdiction.   The further rightof appeal to  quarter sessions conferred by  that subsection  is omitted fromthe present clause  and dealt with generally in Clause  293 of the Bill.  Clause  239. Under Section 80  of  the Act  of 1S75 there  is  an absoluteobligation on every local authority to  make  byelaws relating to commonlodging-houses.  There are many districts in which no such houses exist, andthe clause following the  principle  adopted in other parts of the draft Bill,imposes an  obligation only if  the Minister so requires.  Paragraph  (b) takes the place of  Section 82 of the Act of 1875.  Details!as to lime washing can he more conveniently dealt with by byelaw than in thejstatute itself.  Clause 246 : The power to cancel the registration of the keeper  of a commoillodging house is taken from Section  72  of the Act of  1907.  A provision 1been added erabling the court to disqualify the keeper for such period as ijlthinks fit for  further registration.  In the absence of this provision it  wo &apos;he  possible for  the  local  authority  under  Clause  237 to register again &apos;jperson whose previous registration had immediately before been cancelled.
                                 Part X.                            CANAL BOATS. Clause 250.  Section 9 of the Act of 1877 provides that  before coming intooperation regulations must be laid  before Parliament for 40 days.   In sofar as this  requirement is aimed  at giving the public reasonable notice ofthe regulations before they take effect it has virtually been superseded bySection 1 of  the  Bules Publication  Act, 1893,  which  provides that  in thecase of regulations which are required to  be laid before Parliament, 40 days&apos;notice must be given  of  the Departments intention  to  make  the regula-tions, and the draft regulations must be made available to the public  during that period.  The clause is  accordingly limited to the requirement that theregulations  shall be  laid before Parliament. Section 9 further requires the Local Government Board to take steps for enabling  persons  interested in  the  Regulations under the  Act  to  obtaincopies at  such places in the neighbourhood of canals  as the Board prescribeon  payment of a prescribed sum  not exceeding 6d.   In view  of the factthat all  regulations of general application are  now  required to  be put onsale this provision has been omitted as unnecessary. Clause  251.  Subsection  (3) reproduces  the  provision in Section 3  of  theAct of 1877 that  the master of the boat is to  have the  custody  of  one ofthe  certificates of registration,  but elaborates  it by providing that if heceases to be master, or if the boat ceases to be registered,  he must handover the  certificate  to the owner.   This  was no doubt the intention  of theAct of 1877, which refers  in Section 10 to the case of  the master  of  a boatillegally detaining a certificate. Subsection (5) of the clause, which confers a right of appeal to a court of summary  jurisdiction,  is new,  but  follows  the precedent of  the provisions relating to  common lodging houses :  see  the  note on  Clause  238. Clause 254.  In addition to the  provisions reproduced in this  clause, Sec-tion 4 of  the Canal Boats  Act, 1884,  requires the Local  Government  board to present an annual report to Parliament as  to the  execution of  the  CanalBoats Acts  and also to cause enquiries to be made by inspectors  appointed for the purpose.  We understand that for a number  of years the Ministryof Health have included this report in the annual report of the Department,though it would appear that as the latter  is a Command Paper this  proceduredoes not fulfil the literal requirements of the section.   However that may be, it seems clearly convenient that the report dealing with canal boats  should form part  of  the  more  general  document, and we  are  satisfied that  the requirements of the Act of  1884 with regard  to  a special report and  special investigation are  no longer necessary.  Clause  257.  By Section  14 of the Act of  1877  &quot;  canal boat &quot; was  de- foed as meaning  any vessel used for the conveyance  of goods along a canal (Kept ships registered  under the  Merchant  Shipping Acts.   Section 10 of the Act of 1884 enabled the Local Government Board  to make orders  apply- ing the Acts to classes  of vessels  which  would,  if not registered under the Merchant Shipping Acts,  have  been  within  the scope of the Canal  Boats lets.  In 1922 owing to  the increasing practice of  registering under  the Merchant Shipping Acts  vessels  which were in fact  plying  on canals,  the Minister  of Health made an order  under the last-mentioned section  (Canal Boats Order, 1922;  S.R.  &amp; O.,  1923, No. 451)  bringing within  the scope   the Acts all vessels registered under the Merchant Shipping Acts  which rould otherwise have fallen within  the definition of canal boats except  sea- Siing ships and Thames sailing barges.  The present definition gives effect  to  this Order  but,  in  order to  make  I abundantly clear that the code is  only intended  to apply to commercial  &quot;vessels, adds to the excluded classes vessels used for pleasure purposes only.   In the circumstances it  has been  thought unnecessary to re-enact Sec-  * 10 of the Act of 1884.
                                 Part  XI.                           MISCELLANEOUS.  Clause  258.  Paragraph  (o)  of  this  clause  reproduces  paragraph 2  ofSection 91 of the  Act of 1875,  but without the reference  to  privy,  urinal,cesspool,  drain, or  ashpits.  If  any  of  these are so  foul  or in such a state as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance, action can and should  be taken under Clause 38 or 44 or (so far as ash pits are concerned) under Cl. 91 (1)(a)  or (c).  Clause  259 reproduces part of  Section 8  of  the  Local Government  Act,1894, a provision conferring powers on  parish councils.  It is complementary to other powers possessed by local  authorities to prevent conditions  arising in connection with  watercourses which  may be prejudicial  to health, and ithas therefore been extended so as to apply to local authorities as well as toparish councils.  Clause  261 reproduces Section  51 of  the Act of  1925.    Under Section 7of the Act of 1907  (as applied by the Act of 1925) there is an appeal against any requirement made under this provision to quarter sessions.  In  accord-ance with the general principle adopted in the Bill this appellate jurisdictionhas been  given in the first instance to a court of summary  jurisdiction,  witha further right  of  appeal to quarter  sessions.   The clause does not applyClause  283 of the  Bill,  as the  procedure  under that  clause of  the local:authority executing the works in default and recovering the expense fromthe owner would be inappropriate.   If the owner omits  to do the requiredworks, the only necessary sanction is that building  operations begun in theabsence of the works will expose him to a penalty.  Clause  263 reproduces Section  53 of  the Act  of 1925 but provides for anappeal against the  notice in accordance  with the general appeal machineryof the Bill.  See paragraphs 61 to  63 of the Report.  Clause  265: See  paragraphs 123-4 of  the Report.  Clause  266 replaces Section 110 of the  Act of 1875 and  the whole of  thePublic Health (Ships,  etc.) Act,  1885,  which extends a  number of sectionsof the Act of 1875  to ships.  The provisions of subsection  (3)  of the clause,applying certain  clauses of Part II of  the Bill to ships,  are taken fromSection 50 of the Act of 1925.  Under  Section 2  of the Infectious Disease (Notification) Act, 1889, a  porthealth authority could adopt the Act.  When the Act was made of general application by the  amending Act of  1899, a port health authority became  oneof the authorities for administering the Acts.  Thus a port health authorityderives its functions in the matter of notification of infectious disease direct from  the Acts of  1889  and 1899  and not from the order by which it isconstituted.  The position in this respect is  the  same in London.  The provisions of the  Acts of 1889 and 1899  are now replaced by  Clauses144-147  of Part V  of the Bill, and it has been thought  convenient to treatthem  in  the same  way as  other public health functions  and to enable then to  be assigned  to  a port health authority by  order.  It is, however, to benoted that  the  Acts have been largely superseded, so  far as port health authorities are concerned,  by the  Port Sanitary  Regulations, 1933, madeunder Section 130 of the Act of 1875.   Clause 267 reproduces a number  of enactments  relating to tents, vans,sheds and similar  structures used for  human habitation.   Subsection (3) of the clause  is  new  and  has been  inserted  to meet ipractical difficulty arising  from the doubt whether proceedings in  respectof  a  nuisance  arising from the use  of  a  tent or van could successful?be instituted  against the occupier of the  land on which the tent  or  TSJ
is placed.  The subsection provides  in  effect that  where  a  nuisance  iscaused by  the occupier of a tent, van,  etc., proceedings  may be  insti-tuted  against  the occupier of the land on which the tent or van  is pitchedor standing, but that  it is to be a defence that the tent or van was upon his land  without his authority.   The subsection does  not  exempt the tentor  van dweller himself  from his liability, but it is well known that the enforcement of the  provisions reproduced in the  clause is difficult, if not impossible,  in  the case of persons who are constantly moving from place toplace.   The letting  of  land as pitches  for tents, caravans, etc., by  farmersmd others has now become  a well-established practice,  and it  seems not unreasonable  that  the  persons  who profit by the letting should be held responsible  for the  conditions thereby created.  At the same time, the sub-section imposes no liability  on a farmer  merely because people  campwithout permission  from him on land  such  as roadside margins of  whichhe may legally be the occupier.  We  have  had under prolonged consideration the question of further powersto control  camping.  There  are  two distinct problems:  first,  that of en-campments of  a semi-permanent  kind,  generally on the  outskirts  of  a town,  in  which persons live for long periods  of time and often create slumconditions; and second, that of the  holiday maker,  whether  a motorist,caravan-user,  or walker, who camps for short periods, generally in rural areas.  As  regards  the  latter problem  we understand that negotiations arebeing  carried on with  a  view  to  agreement on  a Bill designed  to givelocal authorities some measure of control  without   unnecessary interference;but until substantial agreement between the  interests  concerned is reached,the matter  appears  to us to be too controversial for the present Bill.  As  regards  the   semi-permanent encampments, the  case  is  somewhat different.   There are  a substantial number  of  provisions  in local  Acts* which prohibit the  use  in  the district  without the consent of the authority of a tent or van for human habitation for a  period exceeding three months (or in the  more recent  provisions,  six  weeks) and require  the approval  of the authority  for any letting of land for the purpose, unless  the land  is provided  to the satisfaction  of the authority with sufficient  roads, sewers, water  and sanitary accommodation.  A right of appeal to a court of summary jurisdiction against a refusal of the  local authority  to approve  an application is conferred.  The clause  contains,  as  a  rule,  a number of  exemptions in  favour  of shepherds,  roundabout  proprietors, travelling showmen,   certain  associa- tions,  etc.; some at any  rate  of these savings  would appear  to be un- necessary  and  probably were introduced  as  being harmless  and likely to disarm criticism.  As  an urban power, which  could  be  applied by the  Minister  to a  contri- butory place in a rural district under Clause 13 of the Bill, we should favour the inclusion  in the general  law of a provision on these  lines.  The local Act clause, however, in  its present form,  presents a number of difficulties,. not the least being the fact that it is necessary in most  cases for  the prosecu- tion to prove in advance  an intention to use the tent or van  for human habitation  for a specified  period.   If  a  more practicable form of clause can be devised before the introduction of the Bill, we should  welcome its inclusion.  Clause  268 reproduces Section  314  of  the Act of  1875  and  Section 2 of the Public  Health  (Fruit Pickers Lodgings) Act,  1882, and is  extended in &quot;ew of developments in recent years to cover persons temporarily engaged in the picking or lifting of  flowers, bulbs and roots.  &apos; e.g. Bury Corporation Act, 1932, Section 143 and Easington Rural  District Councillw, 1935, Section 63.
Part XII.                               GENERAL.   Clause  269.  The  enactments  reproduced in  the Bill  contain a  greatdiversity  of language as regards providing and maintaining hospitals, ambn-lances, baths, and the like.  In some cases an express power to &quot; maintain&quot;and to  &quot;equip&quot; or  provide &quot;apparatus&quot;  is conferred;  in  others not.Again, sometimes, as in Section 131  of the Act of 1875 dealing with hospitals,provision is  made for  contracting for the use  of the subject matter  of thesection.   Throughout  the Bill  a  simple power  to &quot; provide &quot;  has  been inserted  in reliance upon the present clause.   In view of Sections 105,and 107  of the Local  Government  Act, 1933,  there is no need  to  empowera  local authority to  appoint the officers required to secure the  dischargeof the authority&apos;s functions.   An express power to &quot; maintain &quot; is unneces-sary and, if inserted, would cast doubt  on  similar  provisions   in  otherstatutes.   A  general power  for  a  local authority to enter  into  contractsnecessary for the discharge of any of their functions is contained in Sec-tion 266 (1) of the L.G. Act,  1933.  Clause 270 replaces the part of Section 285 of the Act of  1875 which dealswith combinations of local authorities.  The  clause  is however drafted insomewhat wider language, since the Section  is limited to  combinations &quot; forthe purpose of executing and maintaining any works.&quot;   There may well bepurposes under the Bill which involve no works but in which a combinationmay be of  value.    The  clause is  inserted by way of supplementing thegeneral power conferred  on   local  authorities  by Section  9&apos;1 of the  LocalGovernment  Act,  1933, to appoint joint committees, for  the reason  thatsome functions  can be successfully  discharged in combination  without thenecessity  for  establishing  a  joint committee.  Clause  271.  This  clause,  which  takes the  place  of part of Section 285of the  Act of 1875,  has called for a good deal of consideration.  That Sec-tion provides that  a local  authority may,  with  the consent  of  the localauthority of any adjoining district,  execute and do in such adjoining districtall  or  any of such works and things as they  may execute and do within their own district, and on such terms  as to payment or otherwise as may beagreed on between them and the local  authority  of the  adjoining district.At  first sight the section appears  to  prevent a local  authority executingany works outside their own area  except with the consent  of  the councilof the  area in which the works are executed.   The well-known decision ofthe Court of  Appeal in Withington Local Hoard  of Health v. manchester corporation  [1893]  2 Ch. 19, established,  however, that this was not thecase, and that an authority may erect a hospital outside their district witk-out consent.  The reasons for this  decision are  elaborately set out in thejudgments and need  not be here repeated, but we may point out  that the reference  to &quot; such terms as  to payment or otherwise as may be  agreed&apos;&apos;between  the  authorities suggests  strongly  that Parliament had  in  mindsome form of joint  action by authorities and was not intending  to enableone authority to levy something in the nature of a blackmail upon another.!This view of the section is   confirmed  by the  later words  of  the section!which  proceeds:  &quot; Moreover, two   or more local authorities may combine!together for  the purpose of executing and maintaining  any works  that may!be for  the benefit of their respective districts  or any part  thereof.&quot;  TbeseBwords, and in particular the  word  &quot; moreover &quot; which links the two limlsBof the section, make  it in our view reasonably clear  that the section w*Bintended to provide for joint  action  in one of two ways either by  authoritijA  carrying out an undertaking in  the area  of authority  B and allowing Mon terms to make use of it, or by the two authorities acting in combinationfThe final  sentence of the section &quot; All  moneys which any local authority may agree to contribute for defraying  expenses incurred under this section,!
etc., applies not  only to authorities  in combination but  to  contributionsmade by one authority to the other under the first limb of the section, and provides yet a  further  indication  that the section as a  whole deals withcombined action. The Act of 1875 expressly provides for sewerage works and works of watersupply being executed outside  the  area of the authority subject to certainrequirements as to  notice, and in  view of the decision in the  Withingtoncase and. of the  explanation of Section  285 suggested above,  we believethat  the  existing  law   will  be  faithfully  reproduced   by  the  presentclause, which provides that,  subject to the special  requirements of the Billivith regard to  sewerage works and waterworks,  an authority may executeany works outside their area which they are entitled to execute inside.   Ofthe various purposes  dealt with in the present Bill,  those which  commonlycall for  works  outside the authority&apos;s  area  are water  supplies,  sewers andsewage  disposal works,  and  hospitals.   Other possible  examples  are baths,ambulance  stations, maternity and child welfare centres,  and  mortuaries. Clause 272 takes  the. place of Section 38  (5) of the Act of 1925, which enables a local authority to act on behalf of the owner in making  communica-tions between sewers and  drains.  The  clause extends the provision to coverrater pipes. Further it enables  similar arrangements to be  made for the  executionof  any  works which  an owner or occupier is required under  the Bill  to execute. Clause 273 is  a generalisation of three provisions      (1) Section 78  of the  Towns Improvement  Clauses  Act,  1847, which   deals with the materials of houses  pulled down under  the  powers of the   Act;     (2) Section 49 of the Act of 1875, which deals with the sale of manure;   and     (3) Section 101 of  the same Act, which deals with the  sale of any   matter or thing moved in  the  course of abating  a  nuisance. In  all three sections the obligation to repay to the owner any  surplus isqualified by the words  &quot; on demand &quot;.  The clause omits these words  as  ,there seems no  reason why repayment should not  be made  whether  theowner demands it or  not (cf. Section  2  (4) of the Housing Act,  1930). Clause 274 replaces, in a widened form, the third paragraph of Section 306of  the Act  of 1875,  and follows the lines of Section 42 of  the Housing Act,1930.  As a matter of  administration  it is essential that local  authoritiesshould  be  in a position  to know who is the  owner (as defined  in Clause 332of  the Bill) of premises within their area.  Further, since a  charge represent-ing the expenses incurred by a local authority acting in default of the ownerranks in priority to all mortgages, it is a practical convenience  to mortgageesif  authorities are made aware of the  existence of  mortgages.   Negotiationswith  a  mortgagee  frequently  lead to the work  being  done without  thenecessity for the exercise of default  powers.  Clause 275 differs from Section  308  of the Act  of 1875 in the followingpoints       (1)  the limit of jurisdiction  conferred  by  the section on a court of    summary jurisdiction  at the option of either party  is increased  from     20 to  50;      (2)  the jurisdiction of the court is extended to oover the question of    liability, as well as the questions of the fact of damage  and the amount of    compensation.      (3)  As regards Subsection (3) see paragraph 38 of the Report.   The    latter  words  of the subsection Tefer to the discretion  conferred on  local    authorities by Clause 167  (4).
       (4) Subsection  (4)  provides  that any enhancement of the  value of    land belonging to  the person  claiming compensation is to be  set  off    against compensation.  This provision for set-off is now common in local    Acts and has a number of  precedents in the general  law :  e.g., Section    5  (5) of the Roads  Improvement Act, 1925, and  paragraph  2 (c) of the    Schedule to the Development and Road Improvement Funds  Act, 1909.  Section 308 has been  the subject of a number of  judicial decisions,  and inview  of the case law we  have  thought it advisable, subject to the points noted  above, to  reproduce the language  of the  section  without materialalteration.  In  addition to  Section 308  there are throughout the Public  Health Actsa  number of  provisions  either  enabling  or requiring  local authorities topay compensation.   (See Section 121  of  the Act  of 1875;  Section  6, In-fectious Disease (Prevention) Act, 1890; Sections 56, 59 and 66,  Act of 1907;Sections 37, 45 and 59, Act of  1925.)   Some of these were  probably intro-duced  owing  to a doubt whether the  provision in the  later Acts  directingthem  to  be construed  with the Act  of 1875 oould  safely be  relied on asincorporating Section 308.  We  have proceeded on the footing that wherevera provision in a later Act requires compensation to  be paid, in circumstances where there is no question of  default on the part  of  the owner or otherclaimant, the provision  should  be omitted as being covered  by  the presentclause.  To insert special provisions  of  this kind would merely tend to createuncertainty.  A special case which  presents  some  difficulty is that of  com-pensation for destruction of infectious  bedding and clothing.  Section 121 ofthe Act of 1875 provides that  a  local authority may direct the destruction ofsuch bedding and clothing and &quot; may &quot; give  compensation. Section 6 of theInfectious Disease (Prevention) Act, 1890, empowers  the  local  authority torequire the owner to hand over infeptious  bedding and  clothing for disintegration-fection and to compensate him  for any unnecessary damage.  It is not easy to discover what the policy of the legislature has been in this matter, but itseems  that  it was intended to give some  measure  of discretion  to  the  localauthority, and  in that  respect  to distinguish the case from  a claim  fallingunder Section 308.   We have adopted  this principle  in Clause  167.  Clause 276.  See paragraph 19 of the Report.  Clause  277.  Following  the principle adopted in the Local  government act, 1933, we have substituted  for  forms  scheduled to the Bill  a power forthe Minister  to prescribe the  form of any necessary notices, advertisements,etc.  Clause 278  takes  the  place  of Section 266  of the Act of 1875, which  pro-vides  that  notices, orders, etc.,  which require  authentication  by a  localauthority may  be authenticated by the signature of their  clerk,  surveyoror  sanitary inspector.   Subsection (1)  somewhat elaborates this and intro-duces  the medical officer of health and  chief  financial  officer, who in practicesign many  notices  connected with  their  respective  departments.  Subsection (2) is new  and deals with  a point of practical difficulty.  A pro-vision will be found in Section 159 of the  Education Act,  1921,  to the effectthat documents purporting to be signed by  the clerk of  a local educationauthority or  education  committee  shall,  until  the contrary is   proved, bedeemed to have been so signed  and may be  proved by  the production  of acopy purporting to be  so  signed.  This provision enables  the clerk to  sign the original document  and to have his signature  mechanically   reproducedon  as  many copies as are required.  But in the case of large  authorities the signing of  the original document may well make heavy  demands on thetime of the principal officers.  It is  not uncommon, for example,  for fifty ora hundred notices in respect of insanitary houses to  be  issued simultaneously.Under Subsection (1) of the clause. this difficulty,  could be avoided by thfcouncil delegating the power to  sign notices to minor  officials.  The question:which  presents  itself is  whether from  the point of view of the  public it ii
more satisfactory  that notices  should bear a facsimile signature of a well-known officer of the council such  as the town clerk or  medical officer  ofhealth,  or  that it should bear the  actual signature of some minor  ofhciialwhose name  might convey  nothing to the persons  reading the notice.  we feel no  doubt that a facsimile  signature  of a well-known  officer lends moreweight to the document and&apos; is more intelligible to the public; and we con-sider that such  a  signature should  be presumptive,  but not more than pre-sumptive, evidence that the document has been dulyi made and issued, not-withstanding that it is not a  copy  of  an original  document signed  by theofficer with his  own hand.  Clause 279 takes the place of Section 267 of the Act of 1875 but has been drafted  on the model of similar provisions in more  modern legislation.  Theprovision in Section 267 that a  notice served by post is to be deemed to havebeen served  in the  ordinary  course of  post  is  rendered  unnecessary  bySection  26 of the Interpretation Act, 1889.  In the case of notices to a medical officer of  health and to a coroner, theclause authorises service  either at his office or his  residence, since many  ofthese  officers, more particularly in  rural areas,  have no  separate office.Notices  to  other officers must be  served at their offices.  The clause also differs from Section  267  by limiting  the procedure  ofaffixing  a notice to the premises to cases in which the name or address of theowner or occupier cannot  after  reasonable  enquiry  be ascertained.  Clause 280.  The public  health law contains  a wide variety  of  provisionsconferring  powers of  entry.  In the portions  of the Act of 1875 with whichthe present Bill deals, there are four powers (Sections 41, 102, 137 and 305).A further  power  in  the same Act provides for entry  for  the purpose  ofinspecting  meat, and  no less than eight  further powers are to be found  inthe Public Health (Water) Act, 1878, and the Public Health Acts of 1890,1907 and 1925.  In matters of detail  the provisions differ considerably, but in general they are framed on one of two  different  principles.   One  type  of provision is  ineffect a right  of  members and officers of local authorities to be admitted coupled with a  penalty on the occupier  for refusing admission.   The other type is  a right of entry qualified by a provision  that,  if entry  is refused, application for  an order of admission may be made to a justice or (in some cases)  to a  court of  summary jurisdiction:  in this type of case  refusal of  admission is not  an  offence, unless  such  an order  has  been obtained. Sections 41  and 118  of the  Act of 1875  are examples of the  former type, Section 305 of the same Act of the latter.  For the sake of shortening  and simplifying the  legislation, it is  clearly desirable, so far as possible, to substitute a  single code for these numerous provisions, and  the present clause is  intended to cover the whole  Bill except  n three cases,  where special powers are  necessary,  namely       (a) a power to  enter and inspect registered  nursing homes,  provided    in Clause 191;      (b) a power to  enter common lodging houses  (Clause  240 (4) ); and      (c) a power of entry on  canal boats provided in Clause 254.   In all these  cases  the existing  law confers  an  absolute  right of entry and this has been preserved.   The  effect  of the  present clause  is to  enable  any authorised officer  to enter premises  at all  reasonable hours for the various purposes for which entry is required  under the Bill.  It provides, however,  that the officer is not to  demand admission i.e., demand it  from  an  unwilling  occupier  (except where  the premises are a  factory,  workshop  or  workplace) unless 24 hours&apos;  notice  has been  given  and  he  produces on  request a  formal document  showing his right to enter.  Refusal  of admission  in  these circum- stances constitutes an  offence under Clause 281.  Further, power  is given to  ipply  to  a  justice for  a warrant  which will authorise  forcible entry if
necessary.   The  justice must  be satisfied that  notice  of  the  intentionto make  the application  has been given, except  where  the premises areunoccupied or  notice would defeat the object of the  entry.   The  medical officer,  surveyor  and sanitary  inspector  are made  &quot;authorised officers&quot;ex-officio  for matters within their respective provinces and the council areempowered to authorise other officers either generally or specially  (see definj.tion of &quot; authorised officer &quot;  in Clause 332).   A provision, common  in local acts, that an  officer who  has  entered must leave  the premises  properlysecured has been inserted.  Clause 283.  See paragraphs 61-3 of the Report.  Clause 284 takes the place of Section 257 of the Act of 1875.  That sectioncontains a number of references  to  works of private  improvement and inview of the  fact that, for the  reasons  stated  in  paragraph  126 of theReport,  the  procedure of private  improvement  expenses  has not beenreproduced in the Bill, the  language has required considerable  alteration.Attention  may be called to the following points:        (1) Subsection (1) provides  for the recovery of expenses either from    the  person  who  was  the owner at  the date  when  the works were    completed, or from  the owner  at the date when the demand for expenses    is served.   In the great majority of cases these two persons will be the    same,  but occasionally  a  change  of ownership occurs  between   the tw    dates, and in that case it  may sometimes be convenient  for the authority    to recover from  the first  owner and sometimes from the  second. From    the point of view of the owners this alternative right of recovery  involves    no inconvenience, for the purchaser has ample notice of the prospective    liability and  the position as between  him and his  vendor is  covered ii    every  properly drawn contract of sale.      (2) Subsection  (2)   provides   for   instalments   being  payable  at     any fixed interval  and  not  merely at annual  intervals.  This has been    found convenient for owners.  Further,  the  subsection enables a local    authority who have served  a   demand for the whole cost to adopt the    alternative  procedure  of  declaring  the expenses to be  recoverable  By    instalments.  In  subsection  (3) of the clause  a slight amendment  of  Section 77 of tieAct  of 1925 has been made.   Under that section the  Minister is empoweredto fix a  rate  of interest.    It has  been suggested  to us that  owners olproperty  are  fully protected,  if the  Minister fixes the maximum rate, andthat  it is convenient that local authorities should have power within thismaximum to  adopt such rates as  they think fit.   The  subsection is  draftedaccordingly.  Clause 285 enables a  local authority to recover a sum not exceeding 5 percent, of the expenses incurred by them as establishment charges  in  connee-tion with works executed  in default  of or on behalf  of owners or occupiers,Such a power is contained in  Section 9 (2) of the Private Street Works Act,1892, and  has occasionally been  conferred on local  authorities by parliament in local  Acts.  We recommend that it should now form part of the generallaw.  Clause  286.   Section  261  of  the  Act  of  1875  enables  sums  which anrecoverable by a  local authority summarily to be  recovered at their optioiin the  county court, if they are  below   50.  The  clause extends  this bfenabling  the  authority to recover in  any court  of  competent  jurisdictiiiand  thus  introduces the  normal county court  limit  of  jurisdiction  ( lOO)-  Clause 287 takes the place of  Sections 240 and 241  of the Act of 1875, to&apos;has  been  extended so  as  to  cover not  only a person who has advance!money for the execution of works, but a  person  who has himself expendeimoney  for this  purpose.   The  language  of  the  clause has  been to  someextent based on Section 16 of the  Housing Act, 1925.  The provision  in thai
section requiring a  copy of the  charging order  to  be deposited with the clerk of the peace  of  the county  has not been  reproduced, as the  charge is registrable as a local land charge.  Clause 288 reproduces in shortened form Section 251 of the Act  of 1875md similar  provisions in the Acts of 1890 and 1907, so far as they  relateto  offences and  fines.   The summary recovery  of money spent  by a localluthority on behalf of a defaulting owner is dealt  with in Clause 286.  Clause 289 is new.  It is only reasonable that where the execution of theorder of a  court will take some time, e.g. the demolition of a building erectedin  contravention  of  byelaws, lia,bility to a daily  continuing penalty shouldnot arise until after a time fixed by the court.  Clause 290  reproduces Section   253  of  the Act of  1875 but  extends itslightly by  providing  that whichever council or  body has  the function of enforcing  the  provision  in  question may prosecute.  Clause 291 takes the  place of Section 8 of the Act  of 1890 and Section 8of the Act of 1907, but has been redrafted  so  as to bring it into  conformitywith the language used in modern local Acts.  Clause 293 reproduces a  portion of Section 269 of  the  Act of 1875  and corresponding  sections  in the Acts of 1890, 1907 and 1925 enabling appeals tobe made to quarter  sessions.  These sections have become unnecessary in sofar as  they deal with  persons  aggrieved by  a rate,  since for the reasonspointed out in paragraph 129 the only rate &quot;for which the Bill provides isa  water rate based  on net annual value  and provision for  appeals  on thequestion of net annual value is now made in the Rating and Valuation Act,1925.  The clause accordingly is limited to persons aggrieved  by orders or determinations of courts of summary  jurisdiction.  On the general question of appeals  under the Bill see paragraph 18  of  the Report.   Clause  295  reproduces Section  179 of  the Act  of 1875, but with the difference  that it provides for  a  single arbitrator to be appointed  by the parties or, in  default  of agreement,  by the Minister  of Health.  The pro- cedure under Sections  179 and 180, by which, unless both parties concur in the appointment of a single arbitrator, each party  appoints an arbitrator and the two nominate an umpire, is notoriously cumbersome and expensive and was strongly criticised  on these  grounds in the Report  of a Departmental Committee on the  Law of Arbitration  under  the  Chairmanship  of  Mr. Justice Mackinnon (1927, Cmd. 2817, paragraphs  23-26).   In view of the code  provided by the Arbitration Acts,  1889 and 1934, the whole of the detailed provisions of Section 180 of  the  Act of 1875 have been omitted.   Clause 296.   Under  Section 2  of the Justices of the Peace  Act,  1867, a justice is not to be incapable of acting at any petty or special  or general or quarter sessions  on  the  trial of an offence arising under an Act to  be put into execution by  a  municipal corporation,  or  other local  authority,  by reason only of his being  as  one  of  several  ratepayers liable to contribute to or  be benefited by any fund to the account of which the penalty  will be carried.  Section 258 of the Act of 1875 goes further by providing that mem-  krship of a local  authority  is not to  be  a ground of disqualification.  It  &apos;lso applies to both civil and criminal matters.  The present  clause  repro-  duces the  latter  section in so far as  it extends  the  protection to all cases,  whether civil or criminal, arising under the Act, but does not reproduce the  provision  under which membership of a local authority is not to be regarded  is a disqualification.   The case law which is collected in Lumley&apos;s  note to the section shows that,  notwithstanding  the language of  the section,  a justice who as a member of  * local authority  has taken  any active  part in  the proceedings  of the  authority  under review will be held to be disqualified from acting in the case.  Further, we doubt whether, even if the justice has not been actually concerned
with  the  matter when it came before the local authority, it  is  consonantwith  present day opinion that he should sit  on the bench  to deal with thecase.   We understand  that  the usual practice  is for the justice to  take no part in the proceedings,  notwithstanding the existence of the section.  It isalso to be observed that the section, in so far  as it  deals  with membership of the local authorities, has  no counterpart in any of the later  codes dealingwith  local government  services other than public health.  The language  of  the clause  follows generally that  of Section  122 of thePublic  Health  (London) Act,  1891.  Clause 297 reproduces section 265 of the Act of 1875 which protects mem-bers and officers from personal responsibility in  respect of acts done bona fidtin the execution of the Act.  When we prepared the Local Government Billwe considered whether a clause on the lines  of the section in  a  generalisedform  should be  inserted in  the Bill.  AVe eventually decided  not to  adopt this course, partly on the ground that the  framers of the Public AuthoritiesProtection Act,  1893,  which re-enacted  in a more general form  the closely connected  section 264  of the  Act of 1875, refrained, for  reasons which wecould not  trace, from  taking a similar  course  with  section 265,  and partly because the absence of a similar provision in more modern codes,  such  as thoseof education and housing, has not,  so far as we are aware,  given  rise to any difficulty.    Moreover,  it is well  known  that  the  section  which is  a  re-enactment of a section in the Public Health  Act, 1848,  was mainly  requiredin  the  days when  the bodies  exercising  public health functions were notcorporate  bodies and when the members of the body  were accustomed  them-selves to perform many executive acts which would under modern conditions beleft to  the staff.  The section  cannot, however,  be  regarded  as obsolete,  at  any  rate asregards the officers  of an authority, and the  case of G. Scammell  &amp;  NephwLtd. v. Hurley &amp; Others  [1929] 1 K.B. 419 suggests that the section may still have  some practical application even in the case of members. Whether or notthe protection goes too  far involves questions of principle of  far reachingimportance.   We understand  that the Law  Revision Committee  appointedby the late Lord Chancellor has within its terms of reference the considerationof  the  Public  Authorities Protection  Act, 1893, and having regard to tbeimportant and difficult legal issues involved in a redrafting  of section 264 wehave  thought it right to suggest to that  Committee that they might pos-sibly  regard their terms of  reference  as  covering the  cognate question ofthis section.  In the meantime we have reproduced the section in substanceunchanged.   Clause  298 takes the  place of  Section  159  (2) of  the Local government act,  1933, which is repealed.   The reason  why this subsection was  insertedtemporarily  in  that Act is  stated in  the  note  to Clause 156 on  page 85 ofour First Interim  Report (1933, Cmd. 4272).   Clause  299.  Subsection (1) reproduces Section  57 (1) of the Local  Govern-ment Act of 1929 but extends it to cover the  provision of hospitals.  Thisfollows Section 2  of the Isolation Hospitals Act,  1901, which empowers a county council to  contribute  towards the cost  of hospitals  for  infectiondiseases.   The words  in italics have been omitted on  the ground  that ascounty councils  are now hospital  authorities for all purposes, there  is noreason why  their  contributions  should  be thus  limited.   Subsection (2)  is new and is intended  to make it clear that a countycouncil may contribute to the expenditure  of a district council, whether tbeexpenditure is incurred directly or through the agency of  a joint board.   Clause  300 reproduces so much as remains of Section 229 of the Act of1875.  The language of paragraph (o) has  been brought into line with thaiof  Section 57 (1) of the  Local  Government Act, 1929  (reproduced in Clause299) by inserting a reference to sewage disposal works.  Further,  it  is iM*clear in subsection  (2) that expenses incurred  by a rural  district  council n
contributing through a joint board to the construction  and maintenance ofsewerage schemes,  sewage works or waterworks are to  be special, no  lessthan if  they were incurred directly by the council themselves. Subsection (3)  has  been inserted to remove  a difficulty  which has arisenunder Section  56  (1) of the Local Government Act,  1929  (now Section 190 (4)of the Local  Government Act,  1933).  That section provides that a  ruralmthority may contribute as part of their expenditure for general purposesto expenses payable  as special  expenses  and treat the  remainder, if  any,as special expenses.  It appears that, where under this provision the wholeof the expenditure falling to be met  from rates is  contributed as generalexpenses, it is still necessary to keep  separate  parochial accounts althoughfor all purposes other than  accountancy the undertaking is treated as one.The  subsection will dispense with this necessity and secure a  considerablesimplification  of  the  account-keeping. Clause 301 reproduces Section 283 and the first two paragraphs, of Section284 of the  Act of 1875.  The  last two  paragraphs  of  the latter Section,together with  the whole of Section 292 of the same Act, all of which relatefo the procedure for securing payment of precepts,  are rendered unneces-sary by Section 13  of the Rating and Valuation Act,  1925, and are repealedwithout re-enactment. Subsection  (4)  extends the clause to joint committees constituted under clause 8 of the  Bill. Clause 302.   A  general power  of  borrowing for  any  statutory purpose for which borrowing  is permissible is now conferred  on  county councils  andlocal  authorities  by  Part IX of the  Local Government Act,  1933.    Thepresent  clause, reproducing Section 235  of the Act  of  1875,  confers  anadditional  power on  local authorities of  raising money on the  security oflaud and works for sewage  disposal.  It  is not necessary for  the authority,as under the  Local  Government Act, 1933, to obtain   the  consent of  theMinister to a  borrowing.  We have felt  some doubt  whether it is necessary or desirable to retain this  exceptional power.  This method of borrowinguncontrolled by  the  central  department  bears  little  or no relation to the size or importance of the local  authority  concerned, for  owing to differences of local circumstances a small district may have more sewage property  and plant available as  a  security than a larger and wealthier  one which owing,for example,  to its proximity to the  sea, can  dispose of its  sewage withouttreatment.  Some  of  our members, however,  felt  strongly that  the power has  in the past  proved  useful  and  that,  notwithstanding  its somewhatanomalous character, it would be  a  mistake to repeal  the  section withoutreproduction.   A limit of 3&apos;0 years for repayment of loans has been inserted.  The second  paragraph of  the section is no  longer necessary  and has notbeen reproduced.  Clause 303.   Sections 242  and 243 of the Act of 1875 empower the Public Works  Loan  Commissioners  to lend money to  local authorities  for the pur- poses of the  Act.  At the date when the Act  was passed, the powers  con-ferred by these sections on the Commissioners  were substantially wider than those which they had \rnder  the Public Works Loans  Act, 1875, in particular with regard  to the  term of the  loan.   Under the  last-mentioned Act  the maximum  term  was 20 years,  whereas  Section 243  permits of  a term  of 50 years.   By a series of Public Works Loans Acts passed  since  1875  the general powers of  the Commissioners to  lend to local authorities have been so enlarged that they  are  now substantially the  same  as under  these sec- tions.   The  only  difference which need be noted  is  that  whereas under Section 242 the Commissioners may lend for  any of the purposes of  this Act, under Section 2 of the Public Works Loans  Act,  1896,  they may  lend for any work for  which the borrowing authority  are authorised to borrow. Ihe  clause  accordingly  enables  the Commissioners to  lend  under  their irdinary powers for any purposes for  which borrowings may be effected under the Bill.
   Clause 304 replaces  so  much of  Section. 184 of the Act  of 1875  as  is left outstanding by  the  Local Government Act, 1933.  The  form of tbe  clause is determined by Section 250  (10)  of the last mentioned Act, -which defines the term &apos;&apos; the confirming authority &apos;&apos;.   Clause 305.   The  effect of the Bill on local  Acts gives rise  to  questions of difficulty.   In previous Public  Health Acts  and  legislation  of  a similar kind,  the  difficulty  has been met  in  various  ways.  Thus,  under  Sec- tion 3 (1) of the Act of 1907 the Local Government Board were empowered on the application  of  a local authority to make  an order putting Parts or sections  of the  Act into force and  to  declare  enactments  in local  Acts which appeared  to  them to contain provisions  &quot; similar to or inconsistent with  any such Part or section &quot; to be no longer  in force in the district.   In  Section  6 of the Act of 1925,  the Minister is empowered, on the appli- cation  of a local  authority,  to make an order  making  such  amendments or adaptations of a local Act  as appear  to him  necessary for the purposes of bringing the  provisions  of  the  Act into conformity with the provisions of the Act  of  1925.   Section 65 of the Rating  and  Valuation Act, 1925,  contains a  similar provision, the order in that  case  being required to be  laid before  Parlia- ment.   Some  other Acts,  e.g., Section 21 of the Milk and Dairies (Consolidation) Act, 1915, repeal so much of  any local Act as deals with the matters  dealt with  in  the Act  itself  (cf. also Section 122, Road Traffic Act, 1930).  In  certain clauses of the  Bill, special provision is made for the  repeal o&apos;f local  Act enactments  (see  Clauses 54 and 55),  but we  are satisfied that any  general  repeal of  these  enactments on  the  ground that they  deal with  matters dealt  with in the present  Bill is  likely  to give rise to great difficulties of interpretation and should be avoided.   We  have accordingly followed the procedure of Section  6  of the  Act of 1925 and empowered the Minister to make orders.  Subsection  (2), which is new, is  necessary to meet  a case which has given rise to difficulties in  practice,  where the autho- rity  who apply  for  the amendment  of the local  Act  are  the successors of the authority who promoted the Bill.  Clause 306 is drafted on the lines of Section 293 of the Local  Government Act,  1933,  and  enables the Minister  to  substitute  provisions  of  the  new public health law for  the corresponding repealed provisions in orders con- stituting joint boards and port sanitary authorities.  As in Section 293 the power may  be exercised by  means  of a simple order within two years  from the commencement of the Act.  After the expiration of that time the order must  be provisional.  Clause 307  provides  machinery  for  the dissolution  of isolation  hospital committees, see  paragraphs 99 and 100 of the Report.  Clause 308.  This  clause  is  necessitated by the fact that the procedure for making provisional orders laid down  in Section 285 of the Local  Gov-ernment Act, 1933,  assumes that there is an applicant for the order and requires him to  give notice by advertisement of  his proposals.  Clause 309 :  See paragraph 134 of the Report.  Clause 312  provides  for  the transfer  of  properties and liabilities,  thetransfer  of officers and  the superannuation of officers transferred.  Section 150 and  the  Fourth  Schedule of the  Local  Government Act,  1933, deal  withcompensation to  officers, and Clause 313 accordingly provides for  the applioa- tion of these provisions.  The Local  Government Act, 1933, however,  does not deal with the transfer  of  property and liabilities  nor  with the super- annuation  of  transferred  officers.   As  regards these  matters  therefore Clause 312  applies the  provisions of  the Local  Government Act, 1929.
 Clause 313 takes the place of Section 309 of the Act of  1875.  It  covers the various classes of case in  which a local government officer might loseoffice  or suffer  a diminution  of salary as  a  consequence  of  action  taken under the  Bill. The  clause  follows  the general  lines  off Section  51 of  the Town  and country Planning  Act,  1932,  but  the existence  of  the compensation codein the  Fourth  Schedule to the Local  Government  Act,  1933, which thetlause incorporates, enables it to be drafted in a shorter form. Clauses 315  and 316. The existing law with regard to defaulting a localluthority is to  be  found in Section 299  of  the Act of 1875, Section  16 oftlie Local Government Act,  1894, Section  1 of the Public  Health (Tuber-tnlosis)  Act,  1921,  and Section  57  (3) of the  Local  Government Act,  1929.The  first-mentioned section was repealed  by the Act of  1929  except asregards county borough  councils.  It enables the  Minister,  if satisfied afterdue  inquiry that there  has been a default, to make  an order limiting atime for the  performance of the duty and, if the  duty is not performedwithin  the time limited, to apply for  a  mandamus  or to appoint  some person to perform the duty.  Section 16 of the Act of 1894  enables  a parishcouncil  to  complain  to  the county  council  that some provision of thePublic  Health  Acts  has not  been  properly put into force by  the  rural district council,  and  enables the county council  after inquiry to  transfer the function in  question to themselves.   Section 1 of the Act of 1921 relatesio failures on the part  of  county  and  county borough councils  to makeidequate arrangements  for the treatment  of tuberculosis  and enables theMinister to act  in default.    Section 57  of  the Act  of  1929 enables theMinister, if satisfied after inquiry that a borough or district council  are indefault in  discharging any function  relating to public health, to make anorder limiting a time  for the discharge of the function, and if the  functionis not discharged within the time  so limited, to  transfer it to the countycouncil.  So far as we can ascertain, there is no case on  record of  a county council having  exercised their powers  under Section 16  of  the Act  of  1894, and ia view of the new  powers of default conferred on the Minister by Section 57 of the Act  of 1929,  we recommend that Section 16  should be  repealed without re-enactment and that, while the county council should have the power (and duty) of calling the Minister&apos;s attention to alleged  defaults on the part  of a county district council, the actual weapon of default should be exercised by the Minister alone.  Clause 315  accordingly provides for the county council making complaint to the  Minister  and requires the Minister to hold a  local  inquiry.  Clause 316  combines Section  299  of the Act of 1875 and Section  57 (3) of the  Act of 1929.   The language  has been to some extent assimilated  to that of a more  recent default code, Section 52 of the Housing Act, 1930.  The default powers have been extended  to  cover port health authorities, ijoint boards  and joint  committees.  As regards  county  councils, the clause takes the place of and  generalises Section 1  (2) of the  Act of 1921.   Clauses 317 to 319. These clauses,  which are based  on Section  63  of the  focal Government Act, 1894,  and  Sections 54 and 56  of the Housing Act,  1930,  provide the  necessary machinery for the  performance by the  county  touncil or Minister  of  duties  and  powers  transferred  to  them or him on  default and for the  revocation of  a  default order  and the necessary re-  unsfer of property,  debts and liabilities.   House 320: See&quot; paragraph 136 of the  Report.   Clauses  324,  325:  See paragraphs 21 and 22 of the  Report.
  Clause 330.  Under  the existing  Public Health law  reference  is  madeto Crown property or to property belonging to Departments  of the Crownin the following  enactments:        Section 327 of the Act of 1875 provides that nothing in the Act is to    authorise a local authority to interfere with sewers  (sea defences, etc.)    made by Commissioners of Sewers appointed by the Crown, or to inter-    fere with  property belonging  to  the Admiralty  or  War Department    except with the consent of the Commissioners of the Admiralty or War    Department.      Section 9 (7)  of  the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1885, pro-    vides that nothing in  the section (which deals  with tents, vans, etc.) is    to apply to any tent,  van, etc., used by H.M. Forces.      Section 15  of  the Infectious Disease (Notification)  Act,  1889, provides    that nothing  in the Act  is to extend to any building, tent,  van,  shed,    or similar structure belonging to His Majesty, or to any inmate thereof.      Section 5 (b)  of the Local  Government  (Emergency Provisions)  Act,    1916,  qualifies  the last-mentioned  section by requiring the medical    attendant  to  notify cases of  notifiable disease  in  buildings, tents, etc.,    in the occupation of  H.M.  Forces.      Section 12  of  the Act of 1907 declares that nothing in the Act  affects    prejudicially  any right of the Crown, and,  in particular, nothing  in  the    Act  authorises  a local authority to  make  use  of  or  interfere with  any    portion  of the  shore  or  bed  of  the sea, etc.,  &quot; or any land, heredita-    ments, subjects  or right of  whatsoever  description  belonging to  His    Majesty in right of His Crown and  under  the  management of the Com-    missioners of  Woods or of the Board of  Trade &quot;  without  their consent,    which they are  authorised by the  section to give.      Section 10  of the Act  of 1925 contains  a saving for the  Postmaster-    General under the Telegraph  Act, 1869, and for powers conferred on the    Minister of Transport by the London Traffic  Act, 1924.      Section 11 of the Public Health (Smoke Abatement) Act,  1926, requires    a local authority to report a smoke nuisance on Crown premises  to the    Head  of the Department and requires the latter  to take  steps to  abate    the  nuisance.      In addition,  Section 110 of the  Act of 1875, and Section  15  of  the    Infectious Disease  (Notification) Act, 1889, exempt H.M. ships  from the    operation  of  the Acts.  Of these enactments the following are reproduced in the Bill:        Section 15  of  the Act of 1889  and Section 5  (6)  of the Act of 1916 in    Clause 146.      Section 11  of the Act of 1926 in Clause 105.      Section 110 of the Act of 1875 (relating to  ships) in Clause 266.  As  regards the general question of  the application of the public  healthlaw to  lands belonging to the Crown, we are aware  that some difficulties have  arisen in the  past and that there  is a substantial amount of case  lawon  the subject.   We understand  also that the various Departments havefrequently  consulted the  Law  Officers  of  the  Crown on  this matter.   Thequestion is one of general importance and we have thought it  right to re-produce the three  enactments referred to  above  as  they  stand, and  forthe rest, to follow the  principle laid down in Section  327 of the Act of 1875and Section 12 of the Act of 1907,  that the Bill  should not affect houses,
buildings or other property belonging to the Crown except with the consentof the  Department concerned.   We have, however,  amplified the law  intwo  respects       (1) the clause covers Crown land of every description and  (following     Section  77  of  the Land Drainage Act,  1930)  defines the appropriate     authority for giving consent in any particular case;      (2) adopting the principle of Section 33 of  the  Town  and Country     Planning Act, 1932, the clause enables the Department  concerned  to     enter  into  agreements with the  local authority  with  regard to the     application  of  any particular provision of the  Bill,  and provides that,     with the approval of the Treasury, the agreements may contain provi-     sions of a financial  character.  Clause 331 contains borrowing powers in connection  with provisions of theBill  applied to  London.  The clauses of the Bill so applied  are 5, 28, 143,175  and 248-257.  Clause 332. Subsection (1) contains  a number of  definitions,  out of whichit is only necessary to refer to  two.  The definition of &quot; workplace &quot; occursin Clauses  42,  45, 91 and 280  of  the Bill  in  juxtaposition with factories and  workshops.   In the  enactment (Section 22 of the  Act of 1890) which isreplaced by Clause 45 the words used are &quot; every building used as a work-shop  or manufactory, or  where  persons  are employed  or  intended to  beemployed in any trade or business.&quot;  This  language is clearly wide enough  tocover the case of an  office forming part of a  business establishment, but ithas been doubted whether it would cover an office such as that of a non profit-making  society, or one  in  which the  work can-ied on is of a professionalrather than a commercial character.  There appears to be no reason why a distinction in this respect should be drawn between those different types  of offices,  and we  have come  to the  conclusion that the  true distinction  is between work in the nature of domestic service and other employment.  The definition of &quot; street &quot; has been slightly  altered from  that  containedin Section  4  of the  Act of 1875 so as to include the  highway  over anybridge.   Under  the definition in  section 4 &quot; street &quot;  includes  &quot; any publicbridge (not being a county  bridge) &quot;.  The exclusion of county bridges willrequire   consideration  in connection  with any Bill  reproducing  the  pro-visions  of,  the Act of 1875  dealing with  streets, but  is  not of importancein connection with the subject  matter of  the present  Bill, and there  is noreason whj, for  the purpose of  laying  sewers  and water  pipes,  the roadwayover  a  county  bridge  should  not&apos; be  in  the same position as any  otherlength of the street in question.
