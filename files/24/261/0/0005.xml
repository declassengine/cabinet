SECRET                                              COPY NO,   *c.p.. 75 (36)             CABINET                PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY DEER  (SCOTLAND) BILL.              Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of  State for Scotland.     The damage done by deer to the agricultural industry in scotland has been a serious problem in some districts  for many years.  Proposalsfor legislation for the purpose of protecting occupiers of  agricultural land from damage by deer were made by a Departmental Committee  inNovember, 1921, but owing to the difficulties of reconciling conflictinginterests and to difficulties in framing a workable measure, no progress was made.     At intervals during the last six years conferences have taken placefas the result of which the landlords&apos; and farmers&apos; representatives arein substantial agreement as to the form which legislation should take.     The proposed Bill would authorise the setting up of regional commitees who weuld advise from time to time what lands might  and might Inot be used wholly or partly as deer forests.   The committees might -:&apos;also be authorised to supervise, or take, the action necessary  to keepthe number of deer under control and to prevent undue encroachments ofdeer on agricultural land.   The Bill  -would  further authorise  incertain circumstances the killing by farmsjrs  and smallholders of deerfound on such land.     The proposals have been agreed to by the Treasury.     A Bill on the lines proposed may meat with some opposition by the  ILabour Party on the ground that the State is  recognising for the first  1time certain tracts of land as &apos;&apos;deer forests&quot;.   There may  also be some 1criticism from landowners, though their representatives have acceptedthe proposals.   The main points on whioh critics of the proposals are  Ilikely to fasten are -(l)   Owners  of lands not  certified as deer forests  will have no olaim    for compensation for  loss of sporting values.    But on such    properties deer are damaging agricultural and pastoral interests    for many miles around.    Moreover, ample provision will be made to    ensure justice in every case.    The regional  committees will ,  as    agreed in the negotiations which have taken place, have an    independent chairman and include representatives of landowners and    tenants;   and it is proposed to add also representatives of local    authorities.    Provision is also made for appeals to the Department    of Agriculture for Scotland.                                      \(2)   Regional committees  , with the approval of the  Department, will    have pov/er to enter lands for the purpose of killing surplus deer, i    But the  power will not  be exerciseable unless the owners , after    personally stating their case, have shown that  they are not them-  g    selves prepared to deal with the problem, and in no case will    operations be proceeded with in the shooting season.Is      While  it  is likely that the above points and others will arise in  discussion  on  any Bill dealing with so controversial a subject,  I think  that the Government will find it difficult to decline to prooeed with  legislation when so large a measure of agreement has been reached betweaff  the interests  primarily concerned.      I  accordingly ask for authority to prepare and ciroulate to the  Committee of Home Affairs a draft Bill embodying these proposals.COTTISH OFFICE,                                       \ n P P  WHITEHALL ,  S.W.1.
