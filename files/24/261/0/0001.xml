THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1936.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.CP. 71  (36).CABINET.EGYPT.                        PROTECTION  FOR FOREIGNERS.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    &apos;    IN accordance with the decision taken  by the  Cabinet on the 6th March(Cabinet Conclusions  15 (36)), I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum onthe protection of foreigners  in Egypt.  I trust that my colleagues may see their way to  adopt the  recommendations made  in the last  paragraph  of  thememorandum.                                                                    A. E.    Foreign  Office, March 9, 1936.                                 EGYPT.                        PROTECTION  FOR FOREIGNERS.    IN a paper circulated to my colleagues on the 29th February (CP. 66 (36)),.I urged the desirability of revising Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s instructions with regardto a treaty  provision  dealing with the  protection of foreigners in  Egypt.  I suggested that the purposes  aimed at in the  original instructions could betterbe achieved by reverting to  article  3 of the draft  treaty of  1930  alone  (see annex I).  On discussing this suggestion the  Cabinet agreed that the previousproposal for dealing with the protection of  foreigners in Egypt by an exchangeof notes would not be satisfactory;  and  they considered that  the Foreign Officesuggestion  that the matter should be dealt with by  an  article- on the lines ofarticle 3 of the 1930 treaty was preferable; objections, however, were raised tothe wording of the article on the ground that it did not impose on the egyptian government any obligation to call in the assistance of  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the event of disorder which the Egyptian authorities  themselves were unableto control, and that it  did not specifically debar the Egyptian Government fromcalling  in  the assistance of  some other nation.  Amongst  other  alternative suggestions made was one that article 3 should appear in the treaty in its originalform, but that elsewhere in the treaty it  should  be made clear that  in  any emergency requiring outside aid the Egyptian Government would apply  for theuse of the forces of the United Kingdom, and of  no other nation, and that  this limitation should not be confined to the case of external aggression.    2.  As the Cabinet no doubt appreciate, it will be clearly impossible for anyEgyptian Government to say in terms in any published document that, if law andorder broke down in Egypt and foreigners were endangered, they agreed that HisMajesty&apos;s Government  could intervene or that Egypt would invite His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and no other foreign Power to assist  in the protection of foreigners.      8453   r128741
The matter must be covered in a disguised form in some more general provisionfrom which these things can  be deduced; such a provision, however, can do no more than  give  His Majesty&apos;s Government a political and legal .case strong enough to  justify action  in an  emergency.   This should  suffice because the propriety of His Majesty&apos;s Governments action in a matter of this  kind is unlikely to  be submitted to any legal tribunal such as the Permanent Court ofInternational Justice, though conceivably it might be raised before the  Councilof the League of Nations.     3.  With these considerations in mind therefore I have, with a view to giving effect to the desires of the Cabinet, considered the following courses :       (i) To add to article 3 of the 1930 draft the words  &quot;  and will consult with           His Britannic Majesty should circumstances arise likely to threaten           the lives or property of foreigners in Egypt.&quot;-     (ii) To insert in the treaty near the article establishing the alliance (article 5           of the 1930 draft, Annex  II) (article 2 of the 1933 draft, Annex III)           a provision to the  effect that &quot; His Britannic Majesty undertakes to           oppose all intervention in the internal affairs of Egypt by any third           Power.&quot;     (iii) To add to the end of an article in the treaty in the terms of article 7 of           the draft treaty of 1930 (see Annex IV) a sentence in the following           sense:                     &quot; The  high contracting  parties would  also consult together               if circumstances  should arise involving  the  possibility  of  any               intervention into  the internal  affairs  of  Egypt  by  any  third               Power.&quot;  &apos;Since the protection of foreigners is primarily the domestic duty of every State,and since the first part of article 3 of the 1930 draft (which it was contemplatedshould  figure in the  new  treaty) states  that this is Egypt&apos;s  responsibility, it follows that an intervention by a third Power for the protection of its nationals in Egypt is an intervention into the internal affairs of Eg3^pt within the meaning of the text proposed in (iii) above.  That text consequently has the effect (a) of placing the Egyptian Government under an obligation to consult  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment if there is any possibility of any foreign inteiwention, a fact which,coupled with the undertaking forming the second half of  article 3 of the  1930draft,  makes  the  special  position of His Majesty&apos;s Government very evident;(b) that third Powers having the text of the  treaty  before  them would  have adequate notice  of the special position of His Majesty&apos;s-Government, who willhave a  very good justification for relying on that special position in order to oppose any inclination on their part to interfere for the protection of foreignersin Egypt themselves.     4.  I fully recognise that this proposal may not be welcome to the Egyptiannegotiators.   I  feel,  however,  that  it would be  easier to  negotiate   thansuggestions (i)  and (ii),  which  I have  rejected  as being both  impossible  of negotiation with  the  Egyptian  Government, and, so  far as  concerns  (ii),  aspossibly imposing upon  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  an   obligation  whichmight  conceivably be inconvenient.   (Egjqot might, for example, consider  thatshe had the right under that  article to call upon His Majesty&apos;s  Government todo more than she intended, for instance  should Egypt choose to try to repudiate,unilaterally, the  Capitulations.)  I feel bound to say,  however; that  I fear theadoption  of any  suggestion  on  the lines  discussed in  the  Cabinet will  verymaterially increase the difficulties of negotiating a treaty with  the  egyptian government, and that it may  be impossible to secure Egyptian agreement at all.Moreover, I may  perhaps  again point out that in my opinion article 3 of the1930 draft  in effect  gave His Majesty&apos;s Government all that was  reasonably necessary for their purpose :      (a) Because  in  that  article  an  undertaking was  given  by  Egypt  to His           Majesty&apos;s Government for the adequate protection of all foreigners           (an undertaking given to no  other Power), and this undertaking           established, for His Majesty&apos;s Government,  a  special position in this           matter, furnishing them with a  reasonable case for intervention if           this obligation were not fulfilled; and
Foreign Office, March 7, 1936.     (b) Because, if it appeared that any foreign Power was not recognising or:           realising this fact, and that such Power was likely to send troops to           Egypt to protect  its nationals, the  article would give His Majesty&apos;s           Government the  necessary locus standi for stating that they still           retained a special position in this respect, and therefore would oppose           such action on the part of that Power.  Further, this article would           not  make His Majesty&apos;s  Government responsible, vis-a-vis the third           Power, for injuries suffered  by its nationals on Egyptian territory,           except in a case where that Power had wished to send troops to protect           its nationals and  His  Majesty&apos;s Government had opposed this.     5.  I have  consulted Sir M. Lampson on this matter  to obtain his viewsgenerally, and in particular  on the course suggested in paragraph 3 (iii)  above,but unless he replies that it has fair prospects  of  acceptance by the egyptian government, I  hope that His Majesty&apos;s  Government can accept as adequate forthe purposes they have in mind  the  inclusion in an Anglo-Egyptian treaty  ofan article in the terms of article 3 of the 1930 draft, without the insertion of anyfurther provision.  In any case I hope my colleagues will  agree that, should itprove impossible to  secure Egyptian agreement  to  any provision additional to article 3 of the 1930 draft treaty, Sir M. Lampson may have authority to accept that article as adequate, rather  than allow negotiations to  break down on thispoint.
