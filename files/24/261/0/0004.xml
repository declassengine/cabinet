(THIS  DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).S EGRET.       ALTERATION OP ROYAL STYLE AND TITLES.  Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the     Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.       Official representations have recently been made onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union of SouthAfrica that the words &quot;terrarum Britannicarum trans mare&quot;should he substituted for the words &quot;terrarum transuarinarumquae in ditione sunt Britannica&quot; in the inscription on thenew Seals now to he designed.    It has for some years past been apparent that the Union Government do not like the Latinversion of the King&apos;s Style and. Titles, as at present authorised,on the ground that the words &quot;terrarum transmarinarum quaein ditione sunt Britannica&quot; are neither an accurate nor an aptrendering of the phrase &quot;British Dominions beyond the Seas&quot;which now forms part of the approved English version.   their view is that the Latin phrase does not represent the trueconstitutional position.       The present Style and Titles were established by a proclamation issued under Section 1 of the Royal and ParliamentarlTitle by proclamation within six months from the passing.of theAct;  the period of six months having elapsed, the power is nowspent and any amendment of the present Title would require fresh&quot;legislation.       The second preamble to the Statute of Westminster declares that &quot;it would be in accord with the established constitutionalCP.  74 (56).COPY NO.  4-3C A B I N E ToTitles Act, 1927.That Act conferred a power to alter the-1-

It would appear  to       follow that any further legislation with a view to the       alteration of the King&apos;s Title, whether in the English or  the       Latin version., would require the  assent of the Parliaments of       the United Kingdom and all the Dominions,              The words to which the Union Government take exception       are not a very satisfactory rendering of the English  version of       the Title, and if the Union Governments suggestion is amended       to read &quot;terrarum Britannicarum trans mare jacentium&quot; this       would he an improvement,   The full title would then he       &apos;&apos;Edwardus VIII Dei Gratia Magnae  Britanniae, Kiherniae et       terrarum &quot;dri tannicarum trans mare nacentium Rex,  Pidei Defensor,       Indiae Imp era tor., &quot;   We suggest accordingly that it would  he       right to inform the Union Government that, if they find       on enquiry that the proposal now made commends itself to  all       the Dominions and that all the other Governments concerned are       prepared to take such parliamentary action as is needed on their       part to permit of an alteration being made, we should be  quite       willing to take whatever parliamentary action might he necessary       on our pax^t.              &apos;&quot;e should, however, make it clear to the Union Government       that, as the work of preparing new designs for the Seals must he       taken in hand at the earliest practicable date, considerable       embarrassment would he caused if  discussion of the question now       raised were to result in any substantial delay..
