      secret,Copy NoCAB INET.CP. 90 (36)BETTING (N0.1) BILL.Joint Memorandum by the-Home. Secretary and the_Secretary of State for Scotland._1.We should be glad to obtain the views of our colleagues as to the attitude which the Government should adopt towards this bill, the object of which is to  prohibit off-the-course bettingon the pool or pari-mutuel principle .pool or pari-mutuel betting is  as  follows:-     (a)   On-the-course Betting.          Betting on the pool or  pari-mutuel  principle is lawfulon a track (that is premises on which races of any description,athletic sports or other sporting  events  take place),  only ifit is conducted either -     (l)  on approved horse racecourses by,  or by authority of,          the Racecourse Betting  Control  Board under the          Racecourse Betting Act,  1928, or     (2)  on a licensed track, being a dog racecourse,  in          accordance with the provisions  of the  Betting and          Lotteries Act,  1934.    (Section 3 of the Betting          and Lotteries Act,  1934).     (b)   Off-the-Course Betting.          Pool or pari-mutuel betting off the course appears  notto be unlawful provided that -     (l)  there is no resorting  to  premises  for the purpose of2 .The general effect of the existing law relating toeffecting pari-mutuel or pool betting transactions(Section 3(2) of the Betting and lotteries Act,1934).   (In other words the bets must be effected by means of the postal,  telegraph or telephone
           services);   and     (2)   the betting  is conducted on a credit  and not  on a.           cash basis;   (see Section 1 Of the Betting Aot,           1853, as  interpreted by the High Court in the case           of Shuttleworth v. Leeds Greyhound Association           Limited and others:   1933 1 K.B. 400) .          Credit bets  made off the course may be  transmitted by bookmakers or commission agents to approved  horse race-courses for the purpose of such bets being made through theRacecourse Betting Control Board&apos;s totalisators,  and the board are entitled to pay commission in respect of bets sotransmitted:  (see Section 18(2)  of the Betting and LotteriesAct,  1934) .3 .        The Royal Commission on Betting and Lotteries consideredvery carefully the whole question of office pari*-mutuel or poolbetting,  and came to the conclusion that this  type of bettingshould be entirely prohibited.    The Commission pointed outthat enormous opportunities for fraud are inherent in the pari-mutuel system of betting,  and that the frauds  inherent  in thissystem are difficult to detect.   These difficulties areenhanced in the case of office pari-mutuel betting, where thereis no occasion to reveal to backers the details of the  poolsbefore the event is decided, and where calculations can be made after the result is known.   The Commission took  the view that,while it is no part of the duty of the State to take steps toensure that the backer is offered a safe and trustworthy bettingfacility, it was undesirable and contrary to public policy toallow bookmakers to employ a facility which admits of fraud ona large scale, where this fraud may easily go undetected.These considerations led the Commission to the  conclusion thatit was desirable either to regulate or to prohibit the  use ofthis betting facility,  and the Commission saw no  reason in thepublic interest why the State should be called  upon to  set up
the elaborate machinery which would be necessary for effectingsupervision over the activities of bookmakers&apos; who choose to conduct this type of betting.4.        In pursuance of the recommendation of the RoyalCommission, the Betting and Lotteries Bill of 1934, as originallyintroduced, contained a provisiOH,&apos;the effect of which would have been to prohibit all betting on the pool or pari-mutuel principle(whether or not a machine is used and whether on or off the course)except in the case of totalisators operated on approved horse-racecourses or on licensed dog racecourses.5 .        This provision in the Bill excited considerable opposition and the Government decided to withdraw it on the ground that thiswas the only feature of the Bill which proposed a change in thelaw relating to off-the-course betting.   While there wereadvantages in dealing comprehensively with betting on the pari-mutuel principle, there were disadvantages in isolating andsingling out for special restriction one method of off-the-coursebetting while leaving untouched the question of street betting,which dominated the whole problem of off-the-course betting.          In moving the Second Reading of the Bill Lord Londonderryaccordingly announced (House of Lords Official Report of 26thApril, 1934, col. 779) that the Government would move amendments in the Committee Stage for the purpose of allowing the continuanceof office pari-mutuel betting, in the forms in which it was thenlawfully conducted in connection with such sports as horse racing,or foothall matches;   but he said that the Government realised that the decision might leave a loophole for undesirable andpossibly fraudulent practices, and that if ahuses on a large scale, involving serious social consequences,  were to arise as aresult of this concession,  the Government must reserve to them-selves the right to propose such amendments of the law as experience might show to he necessary.
                                                           2 8 b6.        Opponents of the Bill,  who were interested in greyhound racing or in lotteries,  took advantage of the decision to argue that the Bill left untouched the  form of gambling which was mostwidespread and caused the most harm, and those opposed to all forms of gambling, while welcoming the Bill as a whole, weredisappointed at the dropping of the provision.   Attempts were made                                                                   &apos; 1to induce the Government to reverse their decision but were successfully resisted.   Mr. R. J. Russell put down an amendment in Committee in the House of Commons which would have had theeffect of prohibiting all off-the-course pool betting and which led to a debate on the question of football pools (House of CommonsOfficial Report of 5th November,  1934 - col. 683).   The amendmentwas rejected on a division - by 250 to 68 votes.7.        Again, during the Report Stage, a new clause was moved by Mr. Isaac Root for the purpose of controlling, subject to conditions,  pari-mutuel or pool betting business concerned withfootball.   Sir John Gilmour pointed out that the clause would notbe effective since it provided no adequate safeguards against thefraudulent conduct of these businesses, and that it would not be satisfactory to limit the cla.use  to football pool betting.   Herefused to give any assurance that the Government would introduce a Bill to deal with the problem,  but said &quot;the Government reserve to themselves the full right to deal with the problem as and  whenthey find it possible to do so as circumstances demand it&quot;.   he also said that &quot;if and when a private Bill is produced then Ishall be prepared to consider it  and consult with my colleaguesupon this matter&quot;.   The clause was withdrawn by Mr. Root (seeHouse of Commons Official Report  12th November, 1934, col. 1581et seq.).8-        Since the passing of the Betting and Lotteries Act,  1934,evidence has accumulated as to the increasing popularity of footballpool betting and the enormous amount of money which changes handsweek hy week, and the large profit made by the promoters of the
pools.    A Parliamentary Group,  of which Mr.  R.  J.  Russell,  M.P.,appears  to he  the  driving force,  has  prepared a pamphlet entitled&quot;The  Peril of  the  Pools&quot; and  has  put  it  on sale.   It  is estimated in this  pamphlet  (page  39)  that  the total amount of money laid outby the public  on  football pool betting during the 1934/1935  seasonwas in the neighbourhood of  6 -  700,000 a week, amounting to over 20,000,000 for the  season, yielding  a total  rake-off  to promoters of about  6,000,000  and a personal profit to  promoters ofapproximately   2,000,000 or more  per  season.    It has  been represented by a  deputation of the Christian  Social Council  Committewhich the Home Secretary recently received that, judging by  themeasure  of increase  in  the  size  of the pools,  the increase inpostal communications and in  the  number  of postal orders issued,the amount involved  for the present football  season will probably benot very much  less than  50,000,000,  with corresponding increasein the profits derived  from these pools.9.        An attempt has been made to estimate the  volume of officefootball pool  betting by reference to the volume which passesthrough  the postal services.   The Post  Office have suppliedinformation based  on a  special investigation  up to  about the middleof last  December.    This investigation,  supplemented by some later information, shewed  that the  business had been growing throughoutthe season, which  lasts for about 35  weeks.    The number of individual participants or syndicates has averaged each week throughout the  present season  about  3,800,000,  while the number of  postalorders  issued  weekly in connection with  football pools has beenapproximately  3 millions,  bought  by participants and remitted topromoters, and approximately  165,000  bought by the  promoters and presumably remitted  to  winners.    The average value of orders sentto promoters is about 2/6d.  Remittances of  l/-,  l/6d,  and  2/- arethe most common,  covering about  58% of the total.    Remittances of2/6d. to 5/- are  also a fairly substantial proportion.    Theaverage  value  of  orders remitted  by promoters,  i.e.  winning,  is
12/6d.   Larger winnings are , doubtless paid by cheque-.  .  -10.       On the basis of these figures the total sum remitted bypostal orders to the promoters during the present season would bein the neighbourhood of 13 or 14 million pounds.   Otherremittances are no doubt made in the form of stamps, cheques, orbank notes, and, while the estimate of  50,000,000 put forward bythe Christian Social Council Committee is probably an overestimate,it seems clear, in the light of the figures supplied by the PostOffice,  that the volume of office football pool or pari-mutuelbetting is considerable and is growing rapidly.   It may wellamount at present to more than  20 millions a year.   In addition,of course, office pool betting is carried on in connection withother sporting events, e.g. horse races,  and attempts have beenmade to introduce this form of betting in connection with the movements of shares on the Stock Exchange, but it is not possibleto estimate the amount of office pool betting on sports other thanf ootball.11.       The Bill does not single out football pool betting for exceptional treatment but deals with all forms of office poolbetting on equal terms.   This is clearly right since,  if officepool betting involves evil social consequences to such an extent as to require legislation to deal with those mischiefs,  thelegislation should apply to all sports alike.   Pootball poolbetting is the craze today;  tomorrow,  if that were prohibited,the ingenuity of the pool promoters would soon be directed toexploiting other forms of sport.12 -       The supporters of the Bill will no doubt advance thefollowing arguments:-     (a)  that the promoters of office pool betting are engagedin a mass exploitation, for private gain,  of the betting propensityof the population and that this form of gambling has now reachedsuch proportions that serious  social consequences are involved,
II Ip f)and that legislation is necessary to deal with the evil, which is all the more mischievous because it holds out the prospect ofglittering prizes for a small initial outlay:     (b) that the&quot; Bill gives effect to the recommendation of theRoyal Commission on Betting and Lotteries that off-the-coursepool or pari-mutuel betting should not be allowed:     (c)  that the Bill would amend the law in the sense proposedby the Government in the Betting and Lotteries Act, 1934, as originally introduced:     (d)  that the policy of the Bill is in keeping with thegeneral principles embodied in redent legislation which recognise the necessity of interference in some form or other with poolbetting.   All such betting on the course is now prohibitedexcept on approved horse racecourses and licensed dog racecoursesand Parliament has thought it necessary to set up elaboratemachinery for controlling pool betting on the course in the cases in which it is permitted.   In view of the possibilities of fraud,pool betting off the course ought not to be allowed except understrict supervision by independent persons.          The arrangements made by Members of the Football PoolPromoters Association for the certification of the dividents by independent accountants, do not provide any adequate safeguard against fraud.   Nothing but control of the firm&apos;s post, in and out, could do so.   The form of certificate given in the case ofone of the largest firms is as follows:-          &quot;We have examined and checked the total amount to be     received from the pools conducted by Messrs ......  for     the week ending ...... and we certify that after providing     for commission as allowed by the rules and such expenses     as we have certified to be properly chargeable,  the whole     of such amount has been divided amongst the winners,     resulting as follows, subject to further claims being     received in accordance with rules&quot;.
          The accountant issuing the certificate cannot of coursecertify how much money has been staked unless his staff open andcheck all coupons;   nor is he in a position to certify thatentries are not made by, or on behalf of, the promoters after theresults are known;   nor can he guarantee that the winners are bonafide winners and not the nominees of the promoters.          On the other hand there is no reason in the public interestwhy the State should be saddled with the responsibility for the supervision of pool betting in offices .     (e)  that it is anomalous to prohibit large scale lotterieswhile leaving untouched - betting schemes which have many of the characteristics of lotteries.   Where a person has to forecast the result of 12 or 15 matches admitting of hundreds or thousandsalternative solutions, the contest becomes a mere guessingcompetition, and is in substance, though not technically,  a lottery:     (f)  that the Bill has the support of the Football association the Council of which has expressed itself as gravely concernedwith the growth of this form of betting, and its potential evileffect on the sport of football;     (g)  that the prohibition of pool betting would not deprivethose who wish to bet on football of all opportunities of betting.It would still be open to them to bet at fixed odds and indeedfootball betting on the pool or pari-mutuel principle is only a modern development.13 -       On the other hand, the opponents of the Bill will argue -     (l)  that the Bill is an unwarrantable interference with the liberty of the individual:     (2)  that the social consequences are not of such a character as to call for interference.   The average stake of the individualbacker is only about 2/- a week, and there is no reason why heshould be deprived of the interest and amusement which he  derives from this form of betting.   He prefers the pool system to the fixed odds system because for a comparatively small outlay he hasthe chance of winning large sums:
     (3)  that the Bill is class legislation,  since in this form of betting: the stakes are small and its patrons belong mainly to the poorer classes of the population:     (4)  that office pool betting is now a large scale employmentindustry and that prohibition would involve the loss of thecapital invested in it and would turn many thousands of personsout of employment:     (5)  that there is no proof that pool betting has caused anyinjury to the sport of football, and that on the contrary it has reserved to stimulate interest in football:     (S)  that the pool system is fairer to the backer than the fixed odds&apos;system.   The pool promoters have no interest in theresults of the matches and the system does not offer the sameinducements  to the promoters to engage in fraudulent practices:     (7)  that,  if it is necessary for the State to interfere withthis form of betting, it should not be prohibited but should be controlled:     (8)  that it is not desirable to deal with betting off-the-course piecemeal,  and that,  if Parliament is going to legislate,it should do so on a comprehensive basis and should simultaneouslydeal with the problem of street betting and off-the-course  cashbetting.14.       It will be seen that the Bill is likely to be very controversial,  and the cleavage of opinion will not be  on partylines.          Parliament will no doubt expect to receive someguidance from the Government,  and,  since unreserved support  of theBill is politically impossible,  the  choice lies  between thefollowing three  courses:     (1)          to advise Parliament to reject the Bill  on the  groundthat the Government are not  satisfied that a case  has been made out to justify so drastic a  proposal  as the total  prohibition
                                                          2^9                           -10-                           **iJ 6          It would be difficult for tbe Government to adopt thiscourse since tbe Act of 1934 as originally introduced, proposedto prohibit this form of betting and the reason given for thewithdrawal of that proposal was, not that the Government had changed their mind as to its merits, but that it was better toleave office pool betting to be dealt with later in a comprehensivemeasure regulating off-the - course betting generally:     (2)  to promise that comprehensive legislation dealing withoff-the-course betting would be introduced by the Government atthe first convenient opportunity, and to advise Parliament onthis ground not to give a Second Reading to this Bill.          This course could not be adopted unless there was some prospect of time being found in the near future for a furtherBetting Bill.   Such a Bill would be a first class measure andwould necessarily be very controversial.   It is too soon afterthe Act of 1934 to consider introducing fresh legislation to dealwith betting, and there are other problems of much greater importance which will engage the attention of Parliament for sometime to come.   Legislation on the subject of gambling is alwaysunpopular, and, from a political point of view,  it would probablybe unwise for the National Government to saddle themselves withthe responsibility for fresh legislation unless it was clear thatthere would be a very substantial measure of support in the countryfor a Government measure:     (3)  to accept no responsibility for the Bill and to leave it to a free vote of the House of Commons.   The arguments forand against the Bill are clearly set out.   There is scope for a variety of opinion, the issues are plain, and the question whetheror not this Private Member&apos;s Bill should proceed further mightwell be left to the uncontrolled vote of the House of Commons.15 *       This last course is  not heroic,  but in view of the
