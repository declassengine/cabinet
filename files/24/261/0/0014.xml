(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OE HIS BRITANNIC             MAJESTY 1 S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO.SECPjiTCP. 84/36                 CABINET                    INDIA.     Appreciation of the Political Situation,  by  theGovernment 0.1&quot; India, dated 16th March, 1936.     Circulated for the information  of the Cabinet  bythe Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political Situationin India,  dated the 16th March 1936, issued on the    authority of the Secretary of State for India.          There is little of major interest to record forthe month of February, 1936.  Both at the centre and in theprovinces the Legislatures have been in session, but theproceedings of these bodies call for no special comment.  Inthe Assembly, the Congress opposition, in pursuance of theirpolicy to repeal all &quot;repressive&quot; legislation, endeavoured to carry a bill to repeal the Criminal Law Amendment Act of1908, which enables the Government to declare associationsunlawful and is one of the mcs t useful weapons for dealing withany subversive movement, but the bill was thrown out&apos; at thesecond reading by the casting vote of the President.  On two previous occasions, in 1927 and 1924, a similar bill had&apos;been passed in the Lower House by large majorities, and the factthat Congress failed to obtain adequate support from indepen-dent members to carry it on this occasion goes to show thatthere is growing recognition of the dangers of communism and ofthe necessity of providing future local governments with ade-aute powers to carry out duty of maintaining peace andtranquillity in the Provinces.          Though in the Provinces the reduction of revenuecaused by agricultural depression has forced practically all local Governments to introduce deficit budgets,  theGovernment of India1s Budget estimates show a brighterpicture.  The surplus both for years 1934-35 and 1935-36,thanks to increase in customs and excise  revenue,  has proved considerably larger than was anticipated,  andhas enabled the Finance Member, not only  to allot  more funds
&apos;1 n*s Clfunds to the provinces for economic development of ruralarea and for objects connected with the amelioration ofvillage life, but also to meet from revenue the initialexpenditure to be incurred on the 2 hew provinces ofOrissa and Sind, as well as charges already incurred overQuetta, and further to keep in hand funds to meetadditional liabilities which will be imposed on thecentre by introduction of provincial autonomy.          The anticipated surplus in the coming year, 1936-37,after making further subventions to Sind and Orissa, willbe used to reduce taxation and it is, in particular,satisfactory that income tax on incomes below Rs.2,000 hasbeen wholly abolished.  The increase in customs receipts,the slight increase in income tax receipts, and signs of anincrease in the price of agricultural products, all go to showthat India has successfully weathered the storm of theeconomic depression and may look forward, if nothing unforeseenoccurs, to a period of increase in prosperity.  The fulfilment of these hopes will do much to facilitate smooth working of newconstitution.          Situation at Lahore has shown welcome improvementduring the last month. Irresponsible Muslim agitators werepursuing a policy of &quot;civil disobedience&quot;,  i.e.,  obstinate and concerted defiance of law and of all measures taken by Govern-ment to maintain order.   Thanks partly to  the intervention of a Muslim leader from outside province, that policy has nowbeen abandoned and Muslims of all classes have decided toadopt only constitutional methods.  Whether dispute withSikhs over Shahidgunj mosque will be settled,  is however by no means certain.
