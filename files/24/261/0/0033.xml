Memorandum by gone First Lord of the, Admiralty.                The following is the New Construction Programme which           I ash the Cabinet to approve for inclusion in the Navy           Estimates for 1936:-                            2 Capital Ships                            5 Cruisers                            9 Destroyers                            4 Submarines                            1 Aircraft Carrier                            6 Sloops                            A number of small craft viz:-                                1 River Gunboat                                1 Trawler                                2 Motor Minesweepers                                2 Small Surveying vessels                                5 Boom Defence Vessels                                2 Special Service Vessels                                6 Coastal Motor Boats                                  (in future to be called Motor                                   Torpedo Boats)                                3 Tugs           2.   This Programme has been formulated in the light of           the enquiry of the Sub-Committee on Defence Requirements           and provides for:-                (a) Commencement of replacement of the Battle Fleet.                (b) An increase in the rate of replacing old Cruisers, i(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT).
Capital Ship si.3.     With the expiry  of the London Naval Treaty 1930, onthe 31st December. 1936, we are free in 1937 to begin the replacement of the Battle Fleet,4.     It is therefore proposed to include 2 Capital ships in the 1935 Programme and lay them down early in 1937.Cruisers.5.     Under the London Naval Treaty 1930, we have available for 1934, 1935 and 1956, 86,350 tons of 6&quot;Cruiser tonnage.     Of this the 1934 Programme absorbed32,050 tons and. the 1935 Programme 27,300 tons, leaving27,000 tons which may be laid down in 1936.    The 1936Programme, however, need not be limited to this figuresince it can include ships to be laid down on or afterthe 1st January,  1937, when the restrictions of the london naval Treaty will no longer be in force,6,     Our aim is to reach by 1942 a total of 70 cruisersincluding 10 over-age, and in order to achieve this itis necessary to include 5 in the 1956 Programme.7.     To meet the Japanese programme in similar largecruisers, we need 10 6!l cruisers of the SOUTHAMPTON class;8 of these are already provided for,  and it is accordingly proposed, to include the remaining 2 in the 1936 Programme,8.     The 3 other Cruisers will be of a much smallertype (probably about 5,000 tons) which is intended forwork with the main Fleet as  opposed to Trade protectionduties.
9.Underthe London Naaval Treaty1930,  we have available for Leaders and. Destroyers in 1930 and 1936a total of about 51,000 tons.10.The 1935 ProgrProgramme,  as originally api:approved bythe Cabinet,  included a normal Flotilla of a Leader andsubsequently decided, for the reasons stated in CP. 42(35),to substitute for this Flotilla one of 7 Leaders, with7 in order to avoid any substantial increase of cost.Eventually, for reasons stated In CP.193(35), it wasdecided to include both Flotillas, which will absorbabout 25,310 tons.110      Our aim is to possess 12 under-age and 4over-age Flotillas.    &quot;When the 1935 Programme Is completed,we shall have 10 Flotillas of post-war design.12.      We propose in 1936 to lay down a flotilla of9 vessels similar to the Leaders added to the 1935Programme, which will absorb about 16,650 tons of the26,690 tons remaining to us under the 1930 Treaty, andwill give us two Flotillas of 8 such vessels each.It has been approved that all these vessels shall begiven names of tribes (e. g.  NUBIAN&quot;) and known as Tribal01a s s Lestro ye rs*Submarines.13.      Under the London Naval Treaty 1950, we have available for 1954, 1955 and 1936 a total of 10,486 tons.8 Destroyers,which absorbs 12,250 tons.it wasa total tonnage of 12,810 tonsThe number was kept to-3-
 Of this,  the 1934 Programme has absorbed 2,860 tons and the 1935  Programme 3,200 tons,  a total of 6,060 tons. This leaves about 4,400 tons which may be laid down before 31st December,  1935. 14.     The minelayer submarine which it is proposed to include will tiring the total number of this type to 6, the number which we require.    The patrol submarine will be a second vessel of the  1,000 tons &apos;T&apos; type, which will probably be the standard patrol submarine for some years to  come.    The remaining  2 submarines will be of a new small type of about 500 tons intended to replace the &apos; H&apos; class vessels,  which were completed in 1919-20. These 4 vessels will absorb about 3,600 tons of the 4,400 tons available. Aircraft  Carrier. 15.     The Aircraft Carrier proposed may be of less tonnage than the maximum (23,000 tons) allowed by the London Naval Treaty 1936,  but the design is  still under  consideration. Sloops. 16.     The 6 sloops comprise 5  Sloop  Minesweepers, 2  Convoy  Sloops,  and a  Coastal Sloop.    The  3 Sloop Minesweepers  are  necessary as an instalment  of  a programme for  replacing  the  Twin Screw minesweepers constructed during  the  war,  before  their  lives expire. 17.     Convoy Sloops will be used  in  war  time  for escorting Merchant  ships  in  eonvoy, but can be  employed in peace on  the same duties  as the  standard &quot;Patrol&quot; Sloops and  also,  when specially fitted, as surveying ships.We require  some 10 vessels of this  type, and the 2 whicih
                                                  &apos;3 &quot;* &quot;                                                  A ( mlit is proposed to include in the 1936 Programme will bring the total built and building up to 5..   It isproposed;  in future, to classify these vessels as&quot;Convoy Escorts&quot;.18.     The Coastal Sloop and one Trawler  (included under Small vessels) are required to replace oldFishery Protection vessels.Small vessels.19.     The Piver Gunboat represents the first instalment of a programme for the necessary replace-ment of the 11 old Fiver Gunboats in China.20.     The recent purchase of 20 Trawlers for anti-submarine and minesweeping duties makes it unnecessary to continue the replacement programme of 2 Trawlers  ayear begun in 1935 for these purposes, but one Trawlerrequires to be built for Fishering P.rotection purposes,as explained in paragraph 19.21.     The function of the proposed 2 Motor Minesweeperswhich will be wooden vessels of lifeboat type is that of auxillary minesweepers, a large number of  which would berequired in war.   A large proportion of the vessels which would be hired or requisitioned would necessarily be old or lacking in speed, and it is therefore desirableto acquire a number of vessels specially designed for thepurpose, which could be rapidly produced in an emergency.22.     The 2 small Surveying Ships are intended toreplace 2 vessels whose hull lives will expire in 1938.1 of them will be so constructed as to be  suitable for employment as a  sloop minesweeper in time  of war.                    -5-
*   /*a i w        23.   The policy hitherto in regard to  Boom Defence        Vessels has been to build 2 Gate vessels and 1 Boom        Working vessel a year, but in view of the acceleration        of the Naval Deficiency Programme it is necessary, in        order to keep step with the provision of boom material,        to build 3 Gate vessels a year and 3 Boom Working vessels        in two years, and the present proposals in regard to        these craft are made on that basis,        24.   One Special Service Vessel is required as a tender        to H.M.S.  VERNQN, the Torpedo School at Portsmouth and        the  other, for laying indicator loops,  is an essential        part of our preparations,  if we are  to  have it in our        power to establish a Mobile naval base  to meet immediate        strategical needs in case  of emergency.        25,   Coastal motor boats are small very fast vessels of        great value in making or repelling raids in restricted        waters such as the Mediterranean,   Six boats were ordered        as an addition to the 1955 New Construction Programme,  and        it is desired to obtain six more as  early as possible in        the  new financial year.    It is proposed in future to        call these vessels Motor Torpedo Boats.        26.   A financial statement, shewing  the total estimated        cost of the Programme and the probable  spread of the        expenditure over the financial years affected,  is appended.
