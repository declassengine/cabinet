THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1936.SECRET.                                                          Copy No.CP. 78 (36).CABINET.EGYPT : PROTECTION  OF FOREIGNERS.        1      Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a copy (Annex I) of a telegram from His-Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner in Cairo dealing with the suggestion that, besidesincluding in the  proposed  Anglo-Egyptian Treaty an article in the terms  ofarticle 3 of the 1930 Draft Treaty (Annex II) an addition should be made to  anarticle in the  terms  of article 7 of the  1930 draft (Annex III) to the following effect :           &quot; The high contracting parties would  also consult together if  circum-    stances  should arise involving the possibility of any intervention into  the:    internal affairs  of Egypt by any third Power.&quot;    Sir M.  Lampson&apos;s telegram tends to show  that His  Majesty&apos;s government cannot hope to secure from the Egyptian Government on this point undertakings in any appreciable degree greater than those contained in article 3 of the 1930Draft Treaty.  At the same time, I consider that, if His Majesty&apos;s Governmentinsist on an article  in the same terms as article 3 and limit their insistence tothis, there is justification for expecting that they could secure it on this occasiontoo.  I  would therefore once more urge my colleagues to  accept article 3 of the1930 draft without addition.    If, nevertheless, my  colleagues do not feel able to agree to this course, therewould,  judging from  Sir  M.  Lampson&apos;s  telegram, be no serious objection  to^attempting to secure Egyptian agreement to the suggested addition to an article in the terms of article 7  of the 1930 draft.    As regards the  suggestion in the last sentence of the High Commissioner^telegram,  I consider that His Majesty&apos;s Government should refuse to  accept anytext weaker than article 3 of the 1930  draft and, unless  the chance of securing&apos;something stronger should unexpectedly present  itself, should insist on retaining the same text  as in 1930.                                                                    A. E.    Foreign Office, March 14, 1936.8473   [12898][ANNEX I.
ANNEX I.                        Sir M. Lampson to Mr. Eden.(No. 214.)(Telegraphic.)                                       Cairo, March 11,  1936.     YOUR telegram No. 131.     We all here feel that proposed addition is really superfluous.  But  that, ifthe idea is to be  pursued, proposal formula in your telegram is, prima  facie, agood one.     2.  It seems to me that by putting it at the end of article  7 of 1930 draftit should be more  easily acceptable by the Egyptian side.  But  we  must alwaysremember that we ourselves having formally refused to admit the principle  that.a draft unsuccessfully negotiated necessarily applies later  (Egyptians may  noweasily jib at the wording of article 3 of 1930 draft regulations,  which was  onlywrung  from them with  the  greatest difficulty).  Four of the present  Egyptiannegotiators  are the same men as in 1930;  and will thus be personally aware of points on which they then  gave way.  It follows  that we  cannot now bank on egyptian side necessarily agreeing to  the same terms in any article  that  theydid in 1930.ANNEX II.                   Article 3 of the Draft Treaty of 1930.    HIS Britannic Majesty recognises that the responsibility for the lives andpropert)&apos; of foreigners in Egypt devolves exclusively upon the Egyptian  Govern-ment, who will ensure the fulfilment of their obligations in this respect.ANNEX III.                   Article 7 of the Draft Treaty of  1930.    SHOULD any dispute with a third State produce  a situation which involves a risk of  a rupture  with that State, the high contracting parties will consulteach other with  a view to the settlement of the said dispute by peaceful means,in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations andof any other international obligations which may be applicable to  the case.
