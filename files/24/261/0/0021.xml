SECRET.                                                          Copy No.CP. 91 (36).CABINET.MALTA:  PROPOSED  LEGISLATION.       MEMORANDUM BY  THE SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR THE COLONIES.    I DESIRE to obtain the authority of  the Cabinet for the early introductionof the proposed Bill for the repeal of the Malta Constitution Letters Patent.    2   No new question  of policy is involved in this proposal.  The matter hasalready been brought by my predecessors several times before the Cabinet, which on the 31st July last authorised the preparation of a Bill* to deal with the subject.The draft Bill prepared in accordance with this decision has been in readiness forsome time.  But there has been a delay  in its introduction, as, in their considera-tion of the general legislative programme  for the present session, the Cabinet inDecember last decided that it might be held over for the time being.t    3.  I am now advised that the passage of the Bill at an early date has becomeimperative.  I must, therefore, ask for authority to proceed without further delay.I need not rehearse the reasons of policy which underlie the Bill: they  have been set out in detail in my predecessors&apos; memoranda referred to above  and  have been endorsed by the Cabinet.  It is sufficient to say that I am advised that, whatever may be the legal position, it is as a  matter of policy most undesirable that thepresent provisional form of government in Malta should be allowed  to continue.I feel, therefore, that, if we are not prepared to legislate, we shall have to restoreself-government in the Island.  My colleagues, and particularly those  in charge ofthe Defence  Departments, will readily agree that that alternative is impossible.Legislation by Imperial Act is the only course; and it has become  additionallyimportant to obtain  it at an early date,  as Lord Strickland has recently beengranted leave to appeal to the Privy  Council in a case which impugns  the  wholevalidity of.the present form of Government.  It is desirable that before this casegoes further the position in the Island should be properly regularised.  It may beadded that the Foreign Office, who have been consulted, have expressed the viewthat, from their point of view, the sooner the Bill is introduced the better.     4.  The Bill will be only a short, three-clause measure.  Its main object is to restore to the Crown the full power to  legislate for Malta by prerogative legisla-tion, which was lost  when self-government was established in 1921.  When that power is regained it will be possible  by the issue of Letters Patent to  repeal thepresent Constitution and to set up a  form of &quot; Crown Colony &quot; Government.  Itis proposed that for a period of some years at any rate the full administrative and legislative power should be placed in  the hands of the Governor, who  will have an    * See CP. 110 (34), CP. 244 (34), and OP. 156 (35):  and Cabinet 17 (34),  Conclusion 8;Cabinet 39 (34), Conclusion 11; Cabinet 5 (35), Conclusion 6; and Cabinet 41 (35), Conclusion 3.    f Cabinet 51 (35), Conclusion 4 (c).

advisory council of officials and nominated unofficials.  It is not anticipated thatthis form of government can be maintained indefinitely; and the ultimate aimproposed is a more liberal variant of the &quot; Crown Colony &quot; system with repre-sentative, though not responsible, institutions.     5.  The proposed Bill should, I consider, be introduced as early as possible after Easter, and, if practicable, be brought first before the House of Lords.                                                  (Initialled)      J. H.  T.     Colonial Office, Downing Street,            March 27, 1936.
