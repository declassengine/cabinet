MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR  WAR     1. The  Cabinet at their meeting on 31st July, 1935,  reached  the  following    70decisions on the report  of  Mr. Hacking&apos;s  Committee on the Removal  of  the Roj^al  GeneralOrdnance Factories :                                                               8341     (a)  To  accept  the following recommendation by the Committee of ImperialDefence, namely :                &quot; (a) To approve in principle the recommendations of the Report of the           Committee on the Removal of the  Royal  Ordnance Factories forwarded           with the  memorandum  by  the  Secretary of  State  for  War  (C.I.D.           Paper 20S-A).&quot;     (b)  That  the  Secretary  of  State for  War should have  authority, after such           examination  of the Chorley  site as he  might  deem  necessary  having           regard to the risk of  leakage if there were too great delay, to proceed,           subject  to Treasury consent, with the purchase  of  the site  at  Chorley in           Lancashire.     (c)  That the Secretary of State for War in consultation with the Minister of Health           and other  Ministers  as  required,  should  form  an  interdepartmental           Committee composed of representatives of                 The War Office,                The Treasury,                The Ministry of Health,                The Ministry of Labour,                The Scottish Office,           with instructions to consider (on  the assumption that the  principal part of           the Establishment concerned would  be removed to Chorley)  the following           questions :             (i) The possibility and desirability of establishing some part of  the filling                  factory at some site in South Wales.           (ii)  The best site for the Cordite factory at  Waltham whenever it should be                  decided to move it.           (hi)  The best means of mitigating the social consequences of the  removal                  in the  Woolwich  Area, including such  matters as  the  effect on                  housing and the Woolwich Co-operative Society.     2. Consequent on these decisions the War Office appointed a Committee  under thechairmanship of Sir  Arthur  Robinson, and their report dated 12th  February, 1936,is appended.     3. As regards the  site in  South Wales,  the  Lord  President  of the  Councilannounced in the House of  Commons on 2nd March that the Government had come toa definite decision that a new Government factory will be located in  South Wales.     As regards the  site at Chorley the War  Office  have had this examined, but havenot yet sought  Treasury sanction  for purchase, pending the  approval  of the Report ofSir Arthur Robinson&apos;s  Committee by the Committee of Imperial  Defence,  to whom now refer it.

TERMS  OF PEFEPENCE   To consider  (on  the  assumption that the principal  part  of  the establishments concerned would be removed to Chorley in Lancashire)     (i) The possibility and desirability of establishing some part of the           royal Filling Factory at some site in South Wales.    (ii) The best site for  the  Cordite  Factory at  Waltham whenever           it should be decided to move it.

                          REPORT                     THE FILLING FACTORY    1.  General.&apos; :Clause (i) in our Terms of Reference is on the basisof simple transfer of  the Royal Filling Factory to a new site, withoutexpansion of filling provision.  Accordingly we began our work on that basis and investigated the question whether, on removal from Woolwich,the existing filling capacity could suitably  be located in two  factoriesinstead of one.   We u ere, however, advised  at an early stage that,  inconnection with,  the general  proposals for  making good deficiencies  inthe defences of the country, it was  considered necessary to provide fora considerable expansion of filling capacity.  Certain proposals to thisend have been submitted by the Director of Ordnance Factories to theArmy Council, and it appeared obvious to us that, in considering theproblems remitted to us, we were bound to take account  of  theseproposals, since  otherwise our  work might be  largely thrown  away.We have been confirmed in this view by the  progress made since ourappointment in  regard to giving effect to the  general  proposals for making good the deficiencies  in the  defences of the country.   The sameconsideration is relevant to the question of the  contingent removal  ofthe Cordite Factory at Waltham arising under clause (ii) of our Termsof Reference.   There is a general consideration to  which we would draw special attention.  We are advised that a period of approximately  two-and-a-half to three years must  be  expected  to  elapse between  the date onwhich  access is obtained to the  site  of  a new factory and  the date  ofactual  transfer of operatives to  the  factory.  This has  the advantage that it gives time to consider, for example,  the problem of new housing,if necessary, and how provision for it can  best  be  made.   It has the disadvantage that, at the date of actual transfer, the conditions  inregard to numbers employed  may by reason of variation in volume  ofwork, be widely  different from the  conditions now prevailing, and thisintroduces  hypothetical factors into the  problem for which at themoment there is  no solution.   We would add that we have necessarily considered the problem onthe  basis  that  it is  not our  function to determine what output isrequired from  the filling factories as a  whole;  nor  the technical questions of how they should be laid out ;  nor how the different filling-operations  should be  allocated between  different  factories.  these factors affect, however, both  the desirability  of  having a third fillingfactory in addition to the existing reserve factory at Hereford and that proposed at Chorley, and the possibility of finding a  suitable site forsuch a factory within the Special Area  in  South Wales.   We  have,therefore, found it necessary, in  regard to such  matters as these, toproceed on various assumptions which have been furnished to us andwhich  are  explained  below.  If these  assumptions  are accepted,  it becomes  clear that the provision of  a third  factory is  required to  solve the problem.
   We have carried out a search for a suitable site in South Wales andhave directed our attention in particular to the following matters :-    (i) The technical suitability of the site for the explosives processes            to be carried out.    (ii) The safety of the site from hostile attack.   (iii) The question of the location  of the factory in a Special Area&apos;,            and   (iv) The suitability from a housing point of view, &amp;c.    2.  The desirability of having a third filling factory. -Under the pro-posals of the Director of  Ordnance Factories  to which  reference ismade above, certain units at the Hereford Factory would be convertedfor other types of filling and the balance of capacity needed would beprovided in two other factories, i.e.,  Chorley and that contemplated inSouth  Wales, the arrangement  being such that capacity for  eachimportant  class  of  filling  would be provided in two factories,  thusavoiding reliance on one  factory for any important class  of  filling.Under this arrangement the factory  in South Wales would be engagedin the filling of minor components, i.e., fuzes, pyrotechnics,  primers  andfilling  of 13.L. cartridges  with  cordite.   Provision  for this class offilling (other than pyrotechnics) would also be made to a certain extentat the factory  at Chorley, but  none would be made at  Hereford.Hereford is primarily a factory  for H.E. filling, with which, underthe conversion referred to above, certain  cordite filling and assembly will be associated.  There  will, we are informed, be no possibility ofmaking provision there  for the  filling of minor  components.   On thebasis   of the  scheme  above, the factory  in South  Wales would berequired in addition to that at Chorley, partly because of the difficultyof providing the balance not accommodated at Hereford on one site atChorley, having regard to the necessity for complying with externalsafety distances (referred  to below), and  partly  because of  the desir-ability of providing an  alternative capacity for  those  types of fillingwhich will exist at Chorley, but not  at Hereford.    3.  The  site for the filling factory in South Wales. On the  site inSouth  Wales it will be necessary to  construct magazines to hold largequantities  of cordite for B.L. filling, and magazines to  hold smallerquantities of the sensitive powders for fuzes, &amp;c.  These  holdings arerequired to provide a working stock reserve for  factory operations inwar,  i.e., of the order of  two weeks&apos; factory requirements in war  ;they  are not required to  store large war reserves of explosives, theprovision for which would need special  separate consideration.  Thearea  of the  factory  in  South Wales  is  largely determined by  thenecessity of siting the magazines, at certain safety distances (externalsafety distances)  from public  roads and  dwellings.   These distancesare  considerably larger than  the  internal safety  distances  neededbetween magazines and shops.   We do not feel called upon to expressany opinion on  the  question  whether  the  external  safety distancescustomary for peace-time operations  must of necessity be observed  alsounder  war-time conditions.   Assuming,  however,  that  peace-timeexternal distances are to be observed in war, and that the necessary provision has to be made for holding within the factory area the large
 quantity of  explosives needed as  working stocks in war, it seems probable that 900 acres approximately will be needed for the site  in South  Wales.  At our request, the  officers of  the  Royal  Ordnance Factories, in  conjunction with  an  officer of the Lands Branch of the War Office, have  visited South Wales and examined a number of sites. They advise us that in a hilly country like South Wales, and particu- larly in the mining- valleys, it  is impossible to  get a suitably level site of sufficient size,  except near the coast, and they have put to us for consideration  two  sites  both of which are within the Special Area  of South Wales.     (i)  A site (a) of 500 acres approximately near  Bridgend, south  of            the Bridgend Coychurch Road and north of  the  river            Ewenny;  adjoining this is a further site  (b) between            Bridgend  and   Coity  (in the vicinity  of  Brackla)   of            400 acres, not suitable  as a detached  site, but useful as a            supplementary site to the former, thus making a total area            of  900 acres.    (ii)  A site also near Bridgend of 1,200 acres approximately  on            the sea shore  to  the south  of the  Llantwit  Major             GHleston road.    Both sites are  in use as agricultural land, the Glamorgan County Council having  recently  started a  number  of  small holdings  on site (ii).    Site (ii) has advantages  in  respect of probable cheapness of land, cheapness of railway connections, absence of any roads across it, and cheaper magazine construction.   It  is,  however, on  the  sea  shore. Site (i) is  four miles from the sea and nearer a  town, which is an advantage from a labour-supply point  of  view, and also   probably from the point of view of attractiveness to  the workmen  transferred. The question  of  relative safety in time  of war is obviously of the first importance and we have  referred this  question to the General Staff  and the  Air Staff.  Both staffs agree in  preferring site (i) on grounds of safety.   Their reports  are given in  the Appendix.  We remark that when  the Hacking Committee *  held that the location of the new filling  factory in South Wales was unsuitable, there was  in contemplation only one factory to replace that  at Woolwich,  and  that for certain classes  of  work full reliance would therefore have to be placed on that factory.   Under our Terms of Reference the factory in South Wales would supplement that at Chorley and the duplication of activities enables  somewhat less favourably situated  localities to be considered.  We recommend accordingly that the  Filling  Factory supplementing that at  Chorley should be located at site (i).  The  areanecessary to  be purchased will depend  on the factors  of  outputrequirements and  safety distances  to which we have referred  above and in the situation at Bridgend the 900 acres will be  barely sufficient for this purpose.  The cost of  land is relatively so small a part of the   *  Report of the Committee oa the removal of the Royal Ordnance Factories(Woolwich, Enfield, Waltham, &amp;c.) dated  22nd  December, 1934 (A 3918), andappended to CI.D. Paper 208 A.
total cost  of  transferring  the Royal  Filling Factory that we  should recommend on the information before us, that the  full  900 acresshould be  purchased.   4. Effect on local employment, and the necessity to transfer men fromWoolwich. -We have endeavoured to obtain  an approximate idea ofthe reduction of employment at Woolwich  which would  follow  theremoval of the filling work and the numbers  who would  be employedin the two new factories at Chorley and Bridgend.  The numbers inthe latter  two factories will depend on the allocation in peace of fillingwork between them and Hereford, and also on the new  general levelof work orders that may obtain in the future.   We have ascertainedthe numbers employed  in August last at  Woolwich.   These numbers are a  little in excess of the average number employed in the last10 years, but  the  difference  is not large  enough to be of importance for our purpose ; on the other hand they are smaller than the numbers employed  now for the exceptionally large  orders in hand.   In  the Filling  Factory proper (excluding  the S.A.A. filling whichwill  remain at Woolwich) there were in August  770 employees58 ; inthe Tailor, Paper and Leather Shop (an  associated  shop) there were234 employees ; and in the  Engineering  Department  there were  151on Filling Factory services a total of about  1,150 (men and boys).On the other hand the  numbers who would be required at Chorleyand  Bridgend to  produce the same output as the 1,150  at Woolwichwould  be  about  1,250, this larger number arising from  the necessityof duplicating certain ancillary and supervisory, &amp;c, services. 	Numbers required at the new factories on the basis above.	Pivotal men included in Col. 2 to be transferred from Woolwich.	Employees to be taken on locally.(1) Ckorley South Wales	(2) 750f 500i	(3) 250 190	(4) 500 310Total	1,250	440	810   Eventually, as  the pivotal  men are replaced,  as  the  result  of wastage, by local  employees, the  number  of  employees  taken  onlocally would be  those  in Column 2.  In an  emergency the  numbers to be  employed would  of  course be  increased  very  largely.   Theforegoing figures  do not take into account the  labour  which will  beemployed in building  the factory, and relate  only  to  the employeesengaged in the factory on filling work and its ancillary services whenthe factory comes into operation.  The pivotal men  to be transferred   *  The Report  of  the Hacking Committee gives  700 as the  normal peacenumbers including those on S.A.A. tilling.   f  Includes about 80 boys.
 from Woolwich will be required in  order to carry  with them the technical knowledge and  practical experience in the many different classes  of filling operations and to  instruct  the locally engaged employees.   We are assured that it will  be difficult to reduce these numbers, at least to any material  extent.    As regards the employees to be taken on locally in peace and in an emergency the  following  extract from the History of the Ministry of Munitions3, describes the characteristics to be sought :         &quot; The   work at the  Filling  Factories  was  marked by  two     characteristics,  it was unskilled and it was all to a greater or less     degree,  according  to  the nature of the work, dangerous.  While     the first of  the characteristics  widened  the  field from which     labour could be drawn beyond the limits set by the requirements     of  the  more  highly skilled engineering processes,  the  second     confined  the choice of  workers   to  the  most conscientious  and     accurate procurable    .   .   .&quot;    &quot; Generally  speaking,  little     difficulty was  experienced in obtaining  the  large  numbers of     unskilled workers needed for these factories.  Such  shortage as     did occur was  attributable usually to extraneous circumstances     such as a  deficiency of housing  accommodation  or  great local     competition for labour   .   .  .   The  numbers employed in all     the factories in March, 1917, were 92,000, of whom 81 per cent..     were women.&quot;    We  would  add  that the situation of  Bridgend,  near the main railway,  reinforced  by  the facilities  which  motor  transport  now affords, should make it  possible  to obtain the employees required in an emergency without difficulty.    5. Effect of  removal on the Woolwich Area. The third part of  our Terms of Reference directs our attention to this problem and we have duly considered  it.   As we have  already  observed, it is impossible at this date to forecast what  the position  as  regards numbers employed will be when actual transfer of the Filling  Factory takes place on the completion of the new  factories.  In  such circumstances we can only approach the problem on the basis of normal conditions as set forth in. the preceding paragraph of our Report.  Thus we should be required to take account of  1,150  persons employed directly or indirectly on filling work  at  Woolwich.  Of  this  number  about 440  would, as explained, be transferred to the new factories  and the  balance of 710&apos; (of whom a proportion  would  be boys) would cease to be employed on filling work at  Woolwich.   It  is not possible  to say to what extent employment  will be possible  for this balance in the Royal Ordnance Factories and   other departments at  Woolwich, but  assuming the worst,  viz.,  that  no employment can  be found  for  this  balance, there would  be a &quot;normal&quot; reduction of 1,150 in the numbers at Woolwich.  This  represents  a fall of about 15  per cent,  on thefactory  employees, and  about 10  per  cent, on the total employees inthe Arsenal  area.   This reduction of  1,150, though considerable, is(9383)* Volume VIII. Part 2, page 150.B
-much less than the heavy reductions made after the war in the Ordnance Factories.  As late as  1922 the numbers employed in the factories at Woolwich fell from 10,592 in  April, 1922, to  7,413 in  April, 1923. Again  in the economy  period  the  numbers   fell  from   7,876  in April, 1930, to 6,742  in April, 1933.  Relative then  to the general employment problem at Woolwich, a fall of  1,150 does not appear to us to be sufficiently serious  in  its effect on the social consequences at Woolwich or on the Woolwich Co-operative Society  to justify any special measures beyond those  which would normally be taken by the Royal  Ordnance  Factories, namely, to find employment  whenever possible for the men and boys displaced either in the Royal  Ordnance Factories or other  Government departments.    6. Re-housing, $c, of transferred  men in  new areas. This problem is not specially mentioned in our Terms of Reference, but it is obviouslyimportant and some observations in. regard to it seem to be appropriate. The question of the wage rates, whether of pivotal men transferred or new employees to be locally engaged, will have a bearing upon it.   We cannot, however, do more than refer  to the point since it is clearly not within our competence to deal with it.   We may perhaps further note that, in the case of the  pivotal men, questions will arise  as to housing and temporary allowances during the period of settling in at their new stations.  We understand that,  as regards the latter question, there isthe precedent of the transfer of some 160 employees from the Clothing Depot at Pimlico to Didcot in 1933, who received, temporary  allowancesunder the &quot; Travelling Regulations for Civilians/&apos;    In selecting men who are to be offered transfer as pivotal men, the efficiency of the new factories will  be the  first  consideration ;  but, subject  to that, endeavour  will  no doubt be made not  to select those who find difficulty in disposing of houses  which they  either own or on which they have paid a  certain number of instalments of purchase price.    The conditions  of secrecy attaching to the proposed transfer make it impossible at thrs time to ascertain the exact position in this matter of men whom it will be  desirable to transfer.  Some men falling withinthe categories above may  have to be  selected for transfer when thetime comes.  In any such cases it will  be  possible to give long notice of transfer.  Whether any special assistance for  them will be requisite is a question more  appropriately to be considered nearer the time of transfer and with knowledge of the extent of the problem.    The question of new housing for  men imported from Woolwich to Bridgend and Chorley is one which may require further consideration. A very few men will be required, as  part of their duties, to reside in quarters forming part of the factory, but the pivotal men transferred will not be required to reside in special quarters  in or near the factory in fact, it will be better  if they reside at some distance.  As the Chorley factory will be reasonably near the urban centres of Chorley, Preston  and Leyland, it is more likely that it will be possible to findsufficient houses for the  transferred men  than  will be  the case  at Bridgend.   The question  of  housing,  however,  is one which  shouldbe the subject of detailed examination nearer the time of transfer in the  light of the adequacy  of local housing conditions.   The relation
of economic prices or rents of  houses to the wages of the  transferredmen is  a factor  to be taken  into account.  New  housing could beprovided either     (i)  By  the local  authority,  under  suitable  financial arrange-           ments, or    (ii)  By a Housing Association set up specially for the purpose, or   (iii)  By  builders either for sale, financial facilities for purchase           being provided by the local authority, or for letting with           the aid  of a guarantee under the Housing Act,  1933.   Apart from the question of housing, it does not appear to us thatthere  is  need for  special  action in the  matter of  social conditionsgenerally.  Transfer from a large centre of population like Woolwich,part of  the still  larger aggregate  of  London,  may not  in itself be popular.   But in  so far as  Chorley is concerned, there are either in thetown or in the neighbourhood, facilities and amenities to a very&apos;reason-able extent.  At  Bridgend the  position  will be less favourable, but until the exact locality of any new houses to be provided is determinedand  the  arrangements for  their  provision made,  we  think  that consideration of specific action can be left in abeyance.                    THE CORDITE FACTORY   7. Site. Clause  (ii)  of our  Terms  of  Reference directs us to-consider the best site for the Cordite Factory at Waltham, whenever itshould be decided to remove it.   In regard  to this contingent problem,  we have also, as noted inparagraph 1 above,  been compelled to take  account  of developments since we were  appointed.  Thus,  whereas the capacity of the Walthamfactory is 240  tons a week, the 3rd Report  of the Defence Require-ments Sub-Committee (D.R.C. 37) envisages cordite capacity of  500tons a week and it  has  seemed  to us necessary to take capacity ofthat order into account in considering how  the  contingent problem.remitted to us can be solved.  For a factory of  such a capacity, it  isestimated that subject to any special local  conditions an  area of some,500 acres of  land is requisite.   We have thought that we should  bestmeet the needs of  the situation by endeavouring  to see whether a site of this kind, in other respects suitable,  could not also be found  in aSpecial Area,  and  we have, with  this object, had  the  Special Areas in.Scotland carefully examined.   The Superintendent  of  the  Royal  Gunpowder  Factory  and  theLand Agent of the Scottish  Command, after an examination of  thearea, have recommended a site which meets with the approval of  theCommissioner  for the Special Areas in Scotland.   The site consists of1,950 acres and lies to the west of, and adjoins, the 2f miles of railway from Georgetown  to Bishopton, Bishopton  the  further  point beingabout 12 miles N.W. from  Glasgow by rail.  The acreage necessary is somewhat larger than the 1,500 acres estimated  to  be needed  for theoutput desired,  but  we  are advised  that  the area  has  been largelydetermined by the desirability of observing external  safety  distances   (9383)                                                     B 2
from the  large stocks in relation  to  the  quantities  of  explosiveshandled.  Moreover the acquisition of the larger area is recommended in order that a certain control may be obtained over the  water supplyand that the site may have boundaries convenient from a purchase pointof view.   It will be realized that the cost of  land is relatively a small part of the total cost of the factory.   8. Facilities and  safety. The main  railway  from  Glasgow toGreenock forms the eastern boundary of the site, and therefore goodtransport facilities are  available.  JV,ost of  the  other boundaries are formed by public roads.   Water supply  is available from Paisley andfrom the  Dargavel  Burn, which  runs through the site  and is  satis-factory for the technical  purposes.   The Dargavel  Burn will enableeffluent  to be disposed of through  the  River Gryfe into the Clyde.The site is agricultural land, with some plantations of fir and spruce.Certain public roads cross the site, but they appear to serve  only thefnrms, &amp;c, which  form part of  the  site,  and  there  should not, it  isthought, be  any  serious  difficulty  in  closing  them.  The  averagetemperature conditions of the coldest months, which are  of importancein operations involving  nitro-glycerine, are generally comparable withthose of Waltham.   The General Staff and the Air Staff have furnished us with theiropinions as  to  the  safety of the site ; their reports  are given in theAppendix.  Although the site is considered suitable from the safetyaspect, it is of importance, as the Air Staff&apos; point out, that all passivedefence precautions should be taken, and  it  is therefore necessary, ifthe site  is purchased, that trees  should  be planted early, partly as a defence precaution and partly  as a screen to  localise the effect ofexplosions. The present Cordite Factory at Waltham in the neighbour-hood of Epping Forest is  naturally well protected in this way.   Thereis an R.A.F.  aerodrome at Abbotsinch and  a  civil  aerodrome atRenfrew,  and it will be  necessary  to include the factory site in theschedule of explosive areas to be avoided by air pilots.   The same needexists in the case of the site for the Filling Factory.   9. Labour. The  number  of employees  at Waltham during the9 years  1925-1933 ranged from 253  to 288, but since then the numberhas increased, being 488 in April  1934, and.  641  in August 1935.  Ifthe conditions which obtained in 1925-1933 are  representative of thefuture,  it may be expected that the numbers  employed will rangebetween  250 and  300.  It will, however, be necessary  to  transfer anumber of men from  Waltham as pivotal men to  carry the technicalkn wledge and experience with them, probably  about 200  or a littlemore, leaving a balance under the assumed normal conditions of about50 to 100 men to be taken on locally.   In war-time the numbers that will be required to produce an outputof 500 tons a week of cordite would be of the order of 10,000.  At theCordite Factory at Gretna about 70 per cent, of the war-time employeeswere women.   There were  great difficulties at  Gretna in  obtaininglocally the women required, and serious problems of accommodation and welfare had to be overcome.  The site now recommended is 5 milesfrom Clydebank, 4 miles from Paisley, 3 miles from Johnston, 4 milesfrom Renfrew, 7  miles from Dumbarton and 10 to 12 miles  fromGlasgow, and labour should therefore be obtainable without difficulty.
    Part of the site selected  is in fact that on which the war-timefilling factory (250 acres) at Georgetown  existed  which  employed.13,000 persons, 85 per  cent,  of whom were women obtained chieflyfrom Glasgow and the neighbouring towns.    10. Housing,  Sfc, of transferred men. The general consideration as to the transfer of pivotal men set out in paragraph 6 apply equally-here.  Although, as noted above, there are  several towns around the site,  housing  accommodation  for  the pivotal men when  they  aretransferred, may present some difficulties in this area.    11, Cost. In view of the form which, in the changed circumstances,our enquiry has taken, it appears proper that we should append somefigures of cost.  The Hacking Committee estimated the cost of thenew  filling factory at  2,100,000 and of the new  cordite factory at 2,600,000, but these estimates were  based  on different assumptionsfrom those on  which  we have worked.   We  are  advised by  theDirector of Ordnance Factories that an estimate of the cost of the  newFilling Factory at Chorley, given without a detailed survey of the  site,would be of the order of  4,500,000 ;  and  that no estimate has yetbeen worked out for the new filling factory at  Bridgend, but  that the-cost would probably be  of the order  of  2,500,000.   We  note  that schedule  II  in  the 3rd Report of the  Defence Requirements Sub-Committee (D.R.C. 37) shows the cost  of the Army share of the  newfilling provision  there  contemplated  as  3,000,000.   This  sum, weunderstand, represents the cost of the additional capacity required bythe Army over that which now exists at Woolwich, Hereford and inthe  trade.  As Woolwich is to  be  abandoned,  that figure  must obviously  be  increased.   Moreover  it takes no  account  of  fillingcapacity for the Services other than the Army.    We are similarly advised by the. Director  of Ordnance  Factoriesthat the estimated cost of the  factory at Bishopton, suggested to meetthe  contingency  of  the removal  of  Waltham, is of  the  order of 4,500,000, again  given without  a  detailed survey of the site, whichcompares with a figure of  4,200,000 in D.R.C. 37, the Army share in this case representing practically the whole cost.                   Summary of Recommendations    12. (i) On the basis of the assumptions stated in paragx-aph 1, werecommend that  a part of the Filling Factory should be establishedelsewhere than at  Chorley, and that it should be  established on the site of 900 acres at  Bridgend, within the South. Wales Special Area,described, at (i) of paragraph  3, as a suitable site.    (ii) In the case  of the pivotal men who will have to be transferred from Woolwich to Chorley and Bridgend, we understand that, subjectto considerations  of efficiency, every endeavour will be made to selectmen who do not own their own houses, or  are in  process of payinginstalments of purchase money.   Where men of  this type  must betransferred, we are  disposed to think that in view of the long notice of transfer no  special  action need be  taken, but we would  add that  thismatter can more appropriately be considered and decided nearer the-date  of transfer, when the  extent of the problem is known.
   (hi)  Having- regard to the  extent o  the reductions that may benecessary, as explained in paragraph 5, which will be considerably lessthan reductions previously made in the Royal Ordnance Factories, wedo not recommend  any special  local action, whether in regard  to theWoolwich  Co-operative  Society  or otherwise,  beyond  the  measureswhich would normally be taken by the Royal Ordnance Factories tofind  employment  for men  and boys  displaced,  but not transferred,either  in   the  Royal Ordnance  Factories or  other  Governmentdepartments.   (iv)  As regards  housing accommodation for transferred men in thenew areas,  we think that  no special  steps are likely to be necessary atChorley, but that the position  in this  matter at Bridgend will needexamination at  a later stage when the data  of transfer  are definitelyknown.  Apart from this  question of  housing, we see no  need forspecial departmental  action in the new areas as regards conditions ofliving.   (v) If   it should  hereafter be decided  to  remove  the  CorditeFactory at Waltham, we recommend, as  suitable, on the assumptionsstated in paragraph 7, the site  at  Bishopton, situated in the scottish special Area and lying to the west of  the Railway from Georgetownto Bishopton,  10  to 12  miles north-west  of  Glasgow.  In  thisconnection  we  draw  attention to what  we have  stated  as regardshousing, &amp;c, in paragraph  10.   13. We would add an expression of our very high appreciation ofthe services  of our Secretary,  Mr. Hills, who has special knowledgeof these matters derived  from his work on  similar  earlier committeesand whose  assistance to us throughout has been of the greatest value.

                               APPENDIXREPORTS BY THE GENERAL  STAFF  AND THE AIR MINISTRY  ON                              CERTAIN SITES                                SOUTH  WALES                                       1.M.O. 2.  (War Office).   I am directed by the inter-departmental Committee under the chairmanship ofSir Arthur Robinson (the terms o  reference of which are enclosed)  to say that  theCommittee has under consideration two sites in South Wales for a  filling factory,(i) near  Bridgend (north of the River Ewennv at tbe mouth of which there lies theTusker rock and in tbe vicinity of Brackla Hill and  distant 4 miles from the seacoast ; (ii) on the sea coast near Llantwit Major (about 8 miles west of Barry) andwould  be glad to be furnished with the views of  the General Staff whether, havingregard to the special features of their location, these sites are liable  to special risks of attack in war such as to make st unwise to construct a filling factory at either ofthem.   It should be explained  that reliance would not be put solely on this fillingfactory but that additional filling capacity of the kind to  be carried out there willexist either at Hereford  or at another factory further north.   If  in the circum-stances both sites can be regarded as acceptable the Committee would be  glad to  be furnished with the views of the General Staff as to the relative advantages of  thetwo sites from the point of view of safety from attack.                                 (Sgd.)    G. F. S. HILLS,                                                    Secretary of the Committee.  9ih November, 1935.   (A similar question is  being addressed to the Air Staff.)                                      2.   Note supplied by the General Staff, War Office (M.O. 2), 12th November, 1935.   We consider that neither of these sitea is liable to special  risks of attack in  war.Of the two, we prefer the first site, i.e., the one near Bridgend, on the grounds that,being inland     (a) It would be less easy to locate by hostile aircraft ;    (i) It is immune from bombardment by any hostile vessels ;    (c) It will be easier to defend against air attack if this should ever prove to be           necessary.                                       3    Note supplied by the Air Staff,  Air Ministry (D.O. 1), 12*7?, November, 1935.   1.  South Wales is well placed in respect of air attack from Germany on accountof the range of attack and the depth of enemy country which  the German bomberswould have to penetrate.  In respect of attack  from  France. South Wales is more vulnerable as it is approximately 150 miles from the nearest part of France, and ofthat distance French bombers would  traverse only  50 miles of enemy territory, theremainder being over the sea or the Bristol Channel.   2.  South  Wales need not, however, be excluded as  a possible area for a fillingfactory on account of its possible vulnerability to French attack, if a site is selectedwhich cannot readily be located  from the air  and is remote from existing easilyidentified important target areas and provided all possible precautions to reduce theeffect of bombardment are embodied in the lay-out of the factory.  These precautionscomprise dispersal, inconspicuous buildings, concealment and suitable types of  con-struction in respect of splinter and fire-proofing.
   3. Llantwit Major owing  to its proximity to the coast would appear  difficultto protect with anti-aircraft defences, and is also  probably easier to locate from the-air than is  Bridgend  despite the  landmarks of the  Tusker  Rock  and the riverEwenny.  The Air Staff consider,  therefore, that of the two sites Bridgend wouldbe the least vulnerable.                                   SCOTLAND                                       4M.O. 2.  (War Office).   At the request of the Committee on the removal of the R.O.F., &amp;c, under  thechairmanship of Sir Arthur Robinson (the terms of reference of which are enclosed),Dr. Bowden, the  Superintendent of the R.G.P.F., has visited the Lanarkshire, &amp;c,district of Scotland in  order to select a suitable site for a cordite factory.   Dr. Bowden, after  the  examination of 21  sites, has suggested the following siteas the best within the defined area and as prima facie offering a satisfactory site fora cordite factory an area  of about 1,900 acres lying within the triangle formed  byBishopton, Georgetown and Houston, some 7 miles west and northwest of Glasgow.   My Committee would be glad  to be furnished with the views of  the  GeneralStaff as to the safety of  the site from air attack.   A very early reply is requested.                                  (Signed)   G.  F. S. HILLS,                                                    Secretary to the Committee   &amp;th December, 1935.                                       5.   Note supplied by the  General  Staff, War Office (M.O. 2), 9i/i December, 1935.   We think the R.A.F. should be  consulted.   We cannot say that the Glasgowarea is out  of range of air attack, but this will apply to  practically anywhere inGreat Britain.  Safety from attack will depend more on concealment, &amp;c, thoughdistance is of  course a factor,  as also the length of warning likely to be received.   Glasgow may  eventually be covered by defences.   Our view  is that unless the site is a particularly conspicuous one, the risk from air attack does not  appear very great, in fact not sufficient  to outweigh the other advantages.   The lay-out should be based on expert advice as regards Air Raids  Precautionsmeasures.                                      6.   Note supplied by the Air Staff, Air Ministry (D.O. 1), 10th December, 1935.   1. Bearing in mind the necessity for good communication facilities (road, rail and  water) and  the desirability of an adjacent  source  of  labour for  emergencyexpansion, it is considered  that the proposed  site is  one of the most suitable inGreat Britain from the point of view of  security from air attack.   2. The Air Staff desire, however, to  emphasize that in view of the increasingranges of  aircraft and the  important  targets which are already  in the Clyde area,the  risk of  sporadic  air  attack  exists.   They, therefore,,  recommend that  allpossible passive  defence precautions to reduce the effect of bombardment shouldbe embodied in the lay-out of the factory and  that the buildings should, where practicable, be so sited that they cannot readily be located from the air by referenceto any prominent landmark.   3. There  will be no objection to including the site in the Schedule of ExplosivesAreas, and thereby warning pilots  to avoid flying over it.   This  procedure will,however, necessitate notification of  the locality in the &quot;Air Pilot&quot; (Great Britainand Ireland).(B36/4)  120  3/36  W.O.P.  9383
Printed for the  Committee  of Imperial,  Defence.  March 1936.3SECRET,                                                         Copy No.COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the 275th Meeting held on March 26, 1936.        f          *           *          *           *          *         (3) REMOVAL OF ROYAL ORDNANCE FACTORIES.               (OLD. Paper No. 223-A; 210-A; and 211-A.)    (Previous reference :   OLD. Minutes of the 269th Meeting, Minute 4.)    THE  COMMITTEE  had  under  consideration  a  memorandum  by  theSecretary of State for War covering  the  report of the  Inter-DepartmentalCommittee on the Removal  of Parts of the Royal Ordnance Factories (C.I.D.Paper No. 223-A).    MR.  DUFF COOPER said he had  little to add to his  memorandum.  TheWar Office wanted authority to go ahead with the factories under consideration.In reply  to a question by Lord Zetland,  he said that it was  the intention of theWar Office to establish factories both  at Chorley and at Bridgend in Wales.  TheBridgend factory  would  not supersede  the  Chorley factory,  but would be anadditional source of supply.  He  stated that the War Office had not yet obtainedauthority to proceed with the Chorley factory.    SIR THOMAS INSKIP, referring to O.I.D. Paper No. 211-A, said thatthe Cabinet had given  authority for  the Secretary of State  to proceed  with thepurchase of a site at Chorley, subject to Treasury  consent.   He asked whetherthe proposal regarding a  site in South  Wales at Bridgend superseded this authority.    SIR WARREN FISHER pointed out that the two proposals were parallel.Purchase of the Chorley  site had been  approved,  but the purchase  of  land atBridgend had not yet been approved.    MR.  CHAMBERLAIN agreed that the purchase of a site at Chorley hadbeen approved.  He understood that the proposal was limited to the purchaseof a site  at Bridgend.  The question  of constructing the factories would require futher consideration.    LORD  SWINTON referred  to the  two alternative sites specified  in  para-graph 3 of the report.  He understood that site (i) was the more suitable for theerection  of the War Office factory.  The Air  Ministry had been urged to putinstallations in South Wales if possible, and in that  regard, site (ii) would be suitable for the establishment of an Air Force Depot at  which would be storedair frames, engines, &amp;c. It would  be impossible to establish a  strategic aerodrome&apos;in that area, but the establishment of a depot would alleviate to some extent the&apos;problem of unemployment.    MR.  RAMSAY MACDONALD said that he understood  that site (ii) was agood Land Settlement area and it would be a pity if anything  was done to prevent it being used for that purpose.       [12969-1]
    SIR THOMAS INSKIP remarked that this was  not a thickly populatedarea.   He had had an interview with the Commissioner for Distressed Areas,who had been anxious to have the factories constructed in more thickly populated areas and had suggested Pontypool.   . LORD  SWINTON said that an examination  of the whole  area  of  SouthWales had been made, and the Bridgend  area was the only suitable one for thepurpose of the Air Ministry.   - MR. CHAMBERLAIN,  quoting from the report, said that both sites werein use as agricultural land, and that the Glamorgan County Council had recentlystarted a number of small holdings on site (ii).    LORD  SWINTON thought the Land Settlement Scheme was on site (i) andnot site (ii).  He considered that the War Office should take whichever site was most  suitable for their purpose.    SIR THOMAS INSKIP then referred  to paragraph 3 of the memorandumof the Secretary of State for War (C.I.D. Paper 223-A) in which it was  statedthat the War Office had  not yet sought  approval  for  purchase  of the site atChorley,  pending the approval of the report of Sir Arthur Robinson&apos;s committee by  the Committee of Imperial  Defence.   In paragraph 12 (i)  of the report,Sir Arthur Robinsoifs Committee had recommended that a filling  factory shouldhe established on the site of 900 acres at  Bridgend within  the South  WalesSpecial Area described at (i)  of paragraph 3.  He asked whether  the committee approved of this recommendation.    In the ensuing discussion, MR. RAMSAY MACDONALD raised the questionof the Political difficulties which would arise by the displacement of the regularemployees from  the  Woolwich area.  If the Committee were asked to approve of the report as a whole, he would be bound to enter a caveat on this question.  Itwas decided that the approval of the Committee of Imperial Defence  should belimited to the question of erecting the Ordnance Factories and that the political considerations were not the concern of the  Committee of  Imperial Defence at thisstage.    Reference was also made to the recommendation  contained  in  para-graph 12 (v) regarding the site  at Bishopton situated in the  Scottish SpecialArea, which was considered suitable for the erection of a Cordite factory, should-it be decided to remove the Cordite factory at Waltham.   It was generally agreedthat the  Committee of Imperial Defence should approve in principle the recom-mendation  to  establish part of  the filling factory at Bridgend contained inparagraph  12  (i) of the  report and  the recommendation  contained  in  para-graph 12 (v) regarding the site for the Cordite factory at Bishopton.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN, referring to the proposal to  erect a factory atBridgend, said that this question would require further consideration  when the size of the factory had been decided on.    SIR MAURICE  HANKEY suggested  that. as   the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee on the Removal of Parts of the Royal Ordnance Factories had been setiip by the Cabinet, their report should be referred to the Cabinet for approval.                           CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed to recommend- (a!)  That approval  should be  given  to  the  recommendations contained  in      paragraph 12 (i) and 12 (v) of the report of the Inter-Departmental      Committee on the Removal of  Parts of the Royal Ordnance Factories      which  are  as  follows :            &quot;  12 (i)  On the basis of the  assumptions stated in paragraph 1,      we recommend that a part of the  filling factory should be established      elsewhere than at Chorley, and that it should be established on the      site  of 900 acres at Bridgend  within the South Wales Special Area,      described, at  (i) of paragraph  No. 3, as a suitable site.
3-398          12 (v)  If it should hereafter be decided to remove the Cordite      factory at Waltham, we recommend, as suitable, on the assumptions      stated in paragraph 7, the site at Bishopton situated in the Scottish      Special Area and lying to the West  of the Railway from Georgetown      to Bishopton,  10 to 12 miles North-West of Glasgow.   In this con-      nection  we  draw  attention to what  we  have stated as  regards      housing, &amp;c, in paragraph 10.&quot;(b) That the  memorandum  of  the  Secretary  of State  for  War  and      the report  of the  Inter-Departmental  Committee on  the Removal      of Parts of  the Royal Ordnance Factories (OLD. Paper No. 223-A)      together with the  above Minutes  and recommendations  should  be      referred to the Cabinet.:2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,      March 26, 1936.
