THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT                                                                          265SECRET.APPENDIX I.                            CABINET  PROCEDURE.                 Instructions to the Secretary of the Cabinet.    THE Prime  Minister will instruct the Secretary as to what subjects are tobe placed on the Agenda Paper of each Meeting of the Cabinet.  It is contraryto the usual practice for the Cabinet  to  consider  other  subjects.   In cases,however, of very exceptional urgency such subjects may be raised with the consentof the Prime Minister, which should always  be  obtained prior to the  Meeting.The  Secretary will give Ministers as long notice as he can regarding subjectslikely to be discussed, and will issue to members  of the  Cabinet a weekly list of subjects awaiting consideration.    2.  The Secretary will attend meetings of the Cabinet, unless instructed tothe contrary, for  the purpose of recording the conclusions.    3.  It is an  instruction to the  Secretary in drafting Cabinet Minutes, sofar as practicable, to avoid any reference to opinions expressed by any individual and to limit the Minutes as narrowly as possible to the actual decision.    4.  One copy of the draft conclusions will be sent to the King as heretofore&quot; with Humble Duty &quot; from  the Prime Minister.    5.  The conclusions of  the Cabinet  are to be transmitted by the  Secretaryto all Cabinet Ministers and, subject to the authority of the Prime Minister, theSecretary shall transmit to Ministers who  are not members of the Cabinetrelevant extracts  of  Conclusions on particular items with which such ministers are concerned.  The Lord Chancellor, however, is responsible for communicatingto the Law Officers of the  Crown such decisions as concern  them,  subject  to consultation with the Cabinet at the time the decision is taken, or subsequentlywith the Prime Minister if  he deems necessary.    6.  Ministers are responsible for making  such communication as they deem necessary to their respective Departments in regard to the conclusions  of theCabinet.    7.  The Minutes of the Cabinet are always to be available for consultationby Cabinet Ministers, either in the Secretary&apos;s Office, or, during meetings of theCabinet, in the Cabinet Room.    8.  The Secretary is to take all possible precautions for ensuring that in thereproduction of Cabinet  Conclusions the minimum staff  is employed.    9.  The rule  is maintained under which Memoranda, Draft Bills and otherconstituents of the  Agenda Paper of  the Cabinet are  sent  to the  cabinet secretariat for circulation only after their subject-matter has been fully examinedbetween the Department from which they emanate, the Treasury, the Law Officerswhere contentious Bills are involved, and any  other  Departments  concerned.(See attached Treasury Circulars of the 25th February, 1931, and the 28th April,1924.)  In January  1932 the Prime Minister asked that his colleagues  shouldmake it a regular practice before circulating Memoranda to the Cabinet to  passthem  through his hands.  Since that time it has become usual for the minister concerned, before  circulating a Memorandum to the Cabinet, to consult with thePrime Minister and  to send him an advance copy.    10.  Subject  to the above and to  any instructions in  regard to any particularpaper he may receive from the Prime Minister or from the Minister from whomthe document originates, the Secretary is to circulate to  Members of the Cabinetall Memoranda and other documents prepared for the use of the Cabinet.  Subjectto reference in case of doubt, to the Prime Minister or the Minister from whom a document is received,  the Secretary has discretion to circulate Cabinet papersto Ministers outside the Cabinet whose  Departments are affected.  He is  alsoauthorised to send additional copies to Ministers at their request.       [12953-2]
    11.  Subject to any  special instructions he  may  receive from  the  PrimeMinister, the Secretary, as soon&apos; as may be after the termination of every meetingof the Cabinet, will issue a press  communique containing the names of those present.    12.  Departments will  reproduce their  own  memoranda and forward  the requisite number of copies to the Cabinet Office for circulation at least five days before the Meeting of the Cabinet at which the memoranda are to be  considered,but this rule may be waived in cases of special urgency with the Prime Ministerssanction.    13.  It is the duty of all Cabinet Ministers on vacating office to return forth-with to the Secretary to the Cabinet all Cabinet  Conclusions and Papers issued to them while  in office, and it is&apos; the duty of the Secretary  to  the  Cabinet to recover all such Papers.  The same procedure is  to be followed in the case ofMinisters outside the Cabinet on vacating office.    Ex-Cabinet Ministers retain the right of consulting  at  the Offices  of  theCabinet the record copies of all  Cabinet Conclusions and Papers issued to them during the time that they were members of the Cabinet.    14.  The  procedure as regards  Cabinet Committees and  Conferences isattached.(G. 3647.)       &apos;                                                  No. 8/31.                 SUBMISSION  OF BUSINESS TO  THE  CABINET.                      Cabinet Decision as to  Procedure.                                   Treasury  Chambers,Sh,                                     Whitehall, S.W., February 25, 1931.    I am directed by the  Lords Commissioners  of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury to acquaint you, for the information ofthat His Majesty&apos;s  Government have recently  had under consideration thearrangements  regarding the  submission  of business to the Cabinet, and inparticular have had before them the Circular No. 11 /24 of the 28th April, 1924,on this  subject,  the main provisions of which Avere approved by  the Cabinet attheir Meetings on the 10th and 21st June, 1929.    A copy of that Circular  is printed hereunder, and I am to state that HisMajesty&apos;s Government have reaffirmed their decision  that the procedure thereinindicated shall continue to  be observed in its entirety.    In this connexion I am to emphasise the importance of securing that all draftBills are fully examined by the Departments concerned before they are circulatedto the Committee of Home Affairs.  A Department originating legislation should,in any case, arrange for the circulation to that Committee of the draft Bill aslong in  advance as possible, and in every case the covering Memorandum to theBill should, in accordance with the requirements of the Circular, contain a specificstatement that the draft Bill has been examined  by all  Departments which are,or may be, affected by its provisions.                                  I am,  Sir,                                      Your  obedient  Servant,                                               N. F.  WARREN FISHER.                                                                 No. 11/24.                 Copy of Treasury Circular, April 28, 1924.Sir,    I am directed  by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury to acquaint you, for the information ofthat His Majesty&apos;s  Government have  had  under careful consideration  thequestion of insuring that the Cabinet-and Cabinet Committees shall be invitedto reach decisions  only after  the subject  referred to  the Cabinet has  been thoroughly examined between each of the various Public Departments concerned.
    This elementary  rule  of business is essential  if  the  Cabinet and its committees are to have available all the facts and points of view requisite for anenlightened decision and are  to be saved the possibility of hasty or uninformedconclusions.    The observance of the rule is the more obligatory under modern conditionswhen the mass of Government business has so enormously increased, and as  a consequence Governments can only get through it efficiently if the issues presented for decision have been carefully investigated beforehand  by  the Departments in collaboration.    The Cabinet feels  sure that Departments are anxious to  assist it in securingthe observance of this rule, and has come to the conclusion that the desired objectwill be facilitated by the following procedure.   In future all memoranda, draftBills and other constituents of the Agenda Avill be sent to the Cabinet Secretariatfor circulation only after their subject-matter  has  been fully examined betweenthe Departments from  which they emanate, the Treasury,  the Law Officers wherecontentious  Bills are involved, and any  other Department concerned,  and these documents will bear on the face of them a specific statement that this examinationhas taken place.   The documents  should  be  made as  complete as possible bycontaining the various  arguments and criticisms which might be brought againstthe proposals  advocated.  To  enable the members  of the Cabinet (and cabinet committees) to have time to consider proposals intended for Cabinet decision andin view  also of  the possibility that such inter-Departmental  examination may result  in definite differences of  opinion  necessitating the preparation of memoranda  by the dissenting Department or Departments, no memoranda, draftBills,  &amp;c, which originate proposals for Cabinet decision will be placed on theAgenda until an interval of at least five days has elapsed after circulation, except on any occasion when  the Prime Minister expressly authorises a relaxation ofthe rule.                                  I am,  Sir,                                       Your  obedient Servant,                                              N. F.  WARREN FISHER.
SECRET.APPENDIX II.  Existing Instructions as regards the Procedure of Cabinet Committees and                                Conferences.    THE Secretary to the Cabinet and Secretaries of Cabinet Committees are to conform to the following instructions :      (a) The Secretary will take the  Chairman&apos;s instructions as to the  form of          record.  The procedure should approximate to that of the Cabinet, but          a somewhat fuller record of  the proceedings is permissible in  the case          of Committees than in that of the Cabinet.    (&amp;) The Minutes of  the Committee on Home Affairs will be circulated to all          Members  of  the Cabinet, and will not be regarded  as final until          approved by the Cabinet.    (c) The Reports  of  other  Cabinet  Committees will be circulated to  the          Cabinet.  Conclusions in  regard to matters of high policy  will be          reserved for  approval by  the Cabinet.   The Chairman will be  the          judge of what questions should be so reserved.    (d) In cases where Secretaries of Cabinet Committees are not members of the          Cabinet Office, they will place themselves in communication with the          Secretary to the Cabinet with a view to the necessary arrangements as          regards circulation and distribution of the Committee&apos;s documents.o
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET.APPENDIX  III.                     COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Origin.     1.  THE  Committee  of Imperial  Defence  was  formally  brought  into existence by a Treasury Minute dated the 4th May, 1904.  The decision was takenby the Prime Minister of the day, Mr. Balfour, on the recommendation of theWar Office (Reconstitution) Committee, presided over by Lord Esher. The object in view is stated in the following passage of Lord Esher&apos;s Committee report:           &quot; The British  Empire  is pre-eminently a  great Naval, Indian  and     Colonial Power.  There are, nevertheless, no means for co-ordinating defence     problems for dealing with them as a whole, for defining the proper  functions     of  the  various elements and for ensuring that, on  the  one hand, peace     preparations are carried out upon a consistent plan, and, on the other hand,     that, in times  of emergency, a definite war policy based upon solid data can     be  formulated.&quot;     It was to supply this deficiency that the Committee of Imperial Defence was brought into existence.Constitutional Position.     2.  The essential point  to  bear in  mind in regard  to the  constitutional position of  the Committee of Imperial Defence is that  it is  consultative  and advisory, but possesses no executive power.  Decision on policy rests in the last resort with the Cabinet; execution with the Governments Departments.     3.  In practice, the  whole of the conclusions and recommendations of theCommittee of Imperial Defence are not referred to the Cabinet.  On any mattersof higher policy the Committee&apos;s recommendations and  conclusions  are  usuallyreferred to the Cabinet, who then take their decision.   On any matters of less important  character,  recommendations and  conclusions  are  reported  to  theGovernment  Departments  concerned,  who then  take  action  on  ministerial responsibility.Composition.     4.  According  to strict  constitutional theory,  the Committee of  ImperialDefence consists only of the Prime Minister and such persons as he may decide to invite to the meetings.  In the absence of the  Prime Minister the Chair is takenby the  Minister for the Co-ordination of  Defence.   In  practice each PrimeMinister, on  assuming office,  has decided what other persons shall be invited tothe meetings.  At present, invitations are regularly sent to the  following :          The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.        The Lord  President of  the Council.        The Chancellor  of the  Exchequer.        The Secretary of  State  for Foreign  Affairs.        The Secretary of  State  for War.        The Secretary of  State  for Dominion Affairs.        The Secretary of  State  for Air.        The Secretary of  State  for India.        The Secretary of  State  for the Colonies.        The First  Lord of the  Admiralty.        The Chiefs of  Staff of the three  Fighting Services.        The Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, as Head of the Civil Service.        The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign  Affairs.Other persons are invited according to the nature of the business.  For  example,.the Chairman of any Sub-Committee whose report is being discussed is invariablyinvited  to  attend,  and Ministers  or High  Commissioners from Dominions,Ambassadors, Governors of Colonies, Officers of the Indian Army or Officials of      [12953-^3]                                                   B
the Government of India, are often present for the discussion of some particularsubject.  After  the Imperial Conference, 1930, the Prime Ministers of some ofthe Dominions attended a meeting of the Committee, and during the ImperialConference experts from the Dominions and India were associated with the workof several of the Sub-Committees.     5.  In accordance  with  a Statement made by the Prime Minister on  the27th February, 1936, the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence is entrusted with the following general duties, delegated to him by the Prime Minister :          The general, day to day supervision and control, on the Prime Ministers    behalf, of the whole organisation and activity of the Committee of Imperial    Defence.         The co-ordination of executive  action and of monthly progress reports    to the Cabinet, or  any Committee  appointed hy  them,  on the execution of    plans for reconditioning the Defence Services.         Discernment of any points which either have not been taken up or  are    being pursued too slowly, and (in consultation with the Prime Minister or    other Ministers or Committees as  required) of appropriate measures&quot; for their    rectification.Procedure.    6.  The Committee of Imperial Defence includes so many busy men that itcannot meet very frequently, except  in times of crisis.  In normal times  the meetings average about one month.  Detailed  inquiries are entrusted mainly to sub-Committees, some of which are  permanent, Standing  Committees,  othersbeing appointed ad hoc.Sub-Committees.    7.  A diagram of  the Sub-Committee  organisation is  attached.   broadly speaking, the work of Sub-Committees divides  itself very approximately into two main groups-military and civil, though this cannot be interpreted rigidly.  Inthe diagram,  those Committees that are predominantly military are on the left-hand  side of the plan, and those that  are predominantly civil on  the right-handside.  In the centre they tend to merge.  In addition, some of  the Sub-Committeehave been  established  as permanent  standing organisations, while others  are merely appointed ad hoc and are dissolved on  completing  their work.    8.  The strategical side of the work of  the Committee of Imperial defence is looked after mainly by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee  (see paragraph 11),but there is a  small group of satellite Committees working in its orbit.The Defence Policy and Requirements Committee.    9.  This is  a Ministerial body with the three Chiefs of Staff as technical advisers.  Its Chairman is the Prime Minister, but, in his absence, the Chair istaken by the  Minister  for the  Co-ordination of  Defence.   The role  of  theCommittee is to  keep the defensive situation as a whole constantly under review,so as to ensure that our  defence arrangements and our foreign policy are in lineIt reviews  and co-ordinates programmes  submitted to  it for meeting the general needs of the three Services and watches over their fulfilment.Defence Requirements (Official)  Committee.    10.  This Committee consists of the  Secretary to the Committee of ImperialDefence,  the  Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign  Affairs, the permanent secretary to the  Treasury, and the three Chiefs of Staff.  It is-entrusted with thepreparation of co-ordinated programmes, when  these are called for, for remedyingService  deficiencies,  and reports to  the  Defence Policy   and  requirements committee referred to above.The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.    11.  The Chief of the Naval Staff.         The Chief of the Imperial General Staff.         The Chief of the Air Staff.
The Committee is normally presided over by one of the above.  The Minister forthe Co-ordination has the duty of personal  consultation with the Chiefs of Stafftogether, including the right to  convene under his chairmanship the Chiefs ofStaff Committee whenever he or they think  desirable.     The Chiefs of  Staff Sub-Committee  advises  the Committee of  ImperialDefence on the strategical aspects of all problems of Imperial  Defence affectingmore than one of the Service Departments,  as well as on any matters relating to imperial Defence,  on which, in  their opinion, further enquiry or investigation is necessary.  They submit a review of the whole defensive situation once  a yearto the Committee of Imperial Defence.     12.   The Joint  Planning Sub-Committee works under the direction  of  theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee in the preparation of strategical plans.  It  under-takes &quot; long-range planning &quot; as well as the ad hoc investigation of any current problems which may be referred  to it by the Chiefs of Staff.  It is composed ofthe Directors of Plans of the Service Departments and  three other officers,  one from each Department, specially nominated and appointed for the purpose.Oversea Defence and Home Defence Committees.     13.   These are two Sub-Committees which existed before the War and long before the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee came into being, and which now work within the orbit of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.     The Oversea Defence Committee is concerned with questions relating to  thedefence  of the Dominions, Colonies, Mandated Territories, &amp;c, referred to it by government Departments or by the Committee of Imperial Defence.     The Home  Defence  Committee deals  with questions  connected with  thedefence  of Great  Britain,  referred  by Government Departments  or by  theCommittee  of Imperial  Defence,  and has a Sub-Committee  which considersproblems concerning the Air Defence of  Great Britain.     14.   The Joint  Defence Committee is the name given to  joint meetings between the Oversea Defence Committee and  the Home  Defence Committee  forthe consideration of questions common to the two  Committees for example,questions of principle governing local defences of ports, &amp;c.  The Secretary to theCommittee of Imperial Defence usually acts as Chairman.The Man-Power Sub-Committee.     15.   Chairman: The Secretary of State for Air.     This Sub-Committee  deals with questions of man-power in time of war.     It has five Sub-Committees  studying different branches of the  man-powerproblem.The Principal Supply Officers Committee.     16   Chairman: The Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence.     This Sub-Committee and its subsidiary bodies deals with  the organisation in time of peace of supplies of all kinds for war, including both raw materials and manufacture.     The Supply Board, which has a permanent Chairman and consists of  repre-sentatives of the Departments concerned, as well as the Board  of Trade SupplyOrganisation which  deals primarily with the  question of raw materials, besidesseveral subordinate  Sub-Committees,  are included in the  organisation of  thePrincipal Supply Officers Committee.Oil Board.     17.   The co-ordination between the three Services and the civil  populationof  Oil  supplies has been  taken  away from  the Principal  Supply OfficersCommittee at their own request and handed over to an Oil Board.     Chairman: The  First Commissioner of  Works.Imperial Communications Committee.     18.   Chairman: The Secretary of State for the  Colonies.     The Imperial  Communications Committee considers questions of policy inregard to overland  telegraphy,  wireless telegraphy  and telephony,  submarinecables and visual signalling.

The Co-Ordination Committee.    19.  This consists of the Civil Heads of nearly all the Departments of State,with  representatives  of the Staffs  of  the three Service Departments.    TheCommittee is responsible for co-ordinating and  allocating the responsibility for action by Government Departments  on  the outbreak  of war.  It is responsible,inter  alia,  for the War  Book, a description of which has been published in theOfficial History.  (Corbett, Naval Operations, Vol. I.)Middle East &quot; Ministerial &quot;  Sub-Committee.    20.  This Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Secretary of State forthe Colonies, has been formed to consider any questions of policy regarding theMiddle East,  which  must necessarily affect  several other Government Depart-ments.  Its composition accordingly consists of :          The Chancellor of the Exchequer.         The Secretary  of State for Foreign Affairs.         The Secretary  of State for War.         The Secretary  of State for Air.         The Secretary  of State for India.         The First Lord of the Admiralty.    This Sub-Committee is assisted by a standing  &quot;Official&quot;  Middle  EastCommittee, which consists of representatives of the  above Departments.   ThisCommittee deals with all minor questions  of policy and  the preliminary inter-departmental  investigations  and  discussions  that  may  be  required  beforepresentation of a major  question to the Ministerial Committee.Defence of India Sub-Committee.    21.  This Sub-Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Secretary of Statefor India,  with  the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State as Vice-Chairman,considers all questions of the defence of India and its implication. The following ministers are  members :          The Chancellor of the Exchequer.         The Secretary  of State for Foreign Affairs.         The Secretary  of State for War.         The Secretary  of State for Dominion Affairs.         The Secretary  of State for Air.         The Secretary  of State for the Colonies.The Chiefs of Staff  of  the three Fighting Services and  the  Secretary, MilitaryDepartment at the India Office, are also members.Other Sub-Committees.    22.  There  are  other standing  sub-Committees  on such matters as trade questions  in  time of  War; Insurance  of Shipping;  Air  Raids  Precautions(executive action for which is vested in the Home Office);  Emergency Legislation;Censorship; Industrial Intelligence in Foreign Countries;  Distribution  ofImports in time of war; Air Defence Research;  and the Official Histories.  Inaddition, sub-committees are appointed  ad hoc  for the study of any particularquestions of policy or detail.Distribution of  Papers.    23.  Outside the Office of the Minister  for Co-ordination  and Secretariat,files  of  the Committee of  Imperial Defence are  kept permanently by thefollowing :           The King.         Admiralty :  Chief of the Naval Staff and Deputy Chief.         War Office: Chief  of  the Imperial  General  Staff  and  Director  of             Military Operations and Intelligence.         Air Ministry:  Chief and Deputy Chief  of the Air Staff.         Treasury : Permanent Secretary and Sir Richard Hopkins.         Foreign Office  : Permanent Under-Secretary of State.         Dominions Office :  Permanent  Under-Secretary  of State.         Colonial Office :  Permanent Under-Secretary of  State.         India Office : The  Military Secretary.
    Cabinet Ministers and others whose papers are sent for a particular meetingreturn these papers on the understanding that they can always have access tothem even after they leave office.    Under arrangements carefully drawn up with the Dominions Office, certainCommittee of Imperial Defence papers, including those relating to meetings atwhich  the  Dominions High Commissioners  have  been  present,  are sent  to thePrime Ministers of the Dominions.  Mr. Keith Officer, the Australian liaison officer in London, has been  given  access to  all Committee of Imperial defence papers, and, subject to permission in each case, is allowed to send some of these papers to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth.  Every paper issued fromthe Committee  of Imperial Defence has a  number  and is charged  up  to theindividual  to whom it is sent, until its return, when it is taken off his charge.The responsibility for any particular paper can therefore be fixed at a moment&apos;notice.    Agenda papers are issued  under the authority of  the Prime Minister andthe Minister for Co-ordination of  Defence.o
                                                                      270SECRET.APPENDIX  IV.        Composition and Functions of the Economic Advisory Council.    THE Economic Advisory  Council is a standing  body,  reporting  to theCabinet.   It was established by Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, when Prime minister in January 1930. As its title suggests, the Councils main function is to advise his Majesty&apos;s Government in economic matters.   The  Council is also chargedwith the duty of making continuous study  of developments in trade and industryand in the use of national and imperial resources, of the effect of legislation andfiscal  policy at home and abroad,  and of  all aspects of national,  imperial and international economy  with a bearing on the prosperity of the  country.   TheCouncil,  on its  appointment,  took over  the functions  of an earlier standingcommittee of the Cabinet called the Committee of Civil Research.  This had been set up by Mr. Baldwin when Prime Minister in 1925 under the  chairmanship of the late Earl of  Balfour.  The  latter body was concerned mainly with  long-range  investigations  of  &quot;scientific,&quot; as opposed to  &quot;economic&quot;  problems,e.g., sleeping sickness, human and  animal  nutrition and cognate matters.    2.  The Prime Minister is ex officio  Chairman of the Economic AdvisoryCouncil, which consists of four other Ministers (who include the Chancellor of theExchequer and the  President of the Board of Trade) and a number of personschosen by the Prime Minister in virtue of their special knowledge and experience in industry and economics.  In annex 1 to  this note is given a list of the fourteenpersons who at present constitute the non-ministerial element of the Council.    3.  The committees of the Council are of several kinds. In  the first place,there are  two main  standing committees dealing respectively with the two broaddivisions  into which the work of  the Council  falls.   These are  the  Standing-Committee on Economic Information, and the Standing  Committee of scientific research.  These bodies keep a  general watch  on the two sides of the work ofthe Council,  and, in addition, prepare periodical reports on points  of  special interest.   Thus, the Standing Committee  on Economic Information submits, forthe consideration of the Government, a report on the economic situation  every two or three months.    4.  In the next class of committee are those which may be called specialiststanding  committees.   In  this class  falls the  CounciPs Committee  on  LocustControl, which was  appointed in 1929, and their Tsetse Fly Committee, which wasappointed in 1925.   The former is responsible for a  scheme for  the  systematicinvestigation of the locust problem, which has received international recognitionat the International Locust Conferences  held in Rome, Paris, and London, in1931, 1932, and  1934.  Similarly, the Tsetse Fly Committee of the  Council keepsunder continuous review progress  in the diagnosis and treatment of human andanimal trypanosomiasis, and developments in the technique of tsetse fly control.     5.  Finally, there  is a third class of committee, the pui&apos;ely ad hoc  committee. Committees of this type  are appointed to  consider particular problems on whichthey  submit a report, and then pass out of existence.  Examples of this kind ofcommittee are the  Committee on the  Cotton Industry,  which  reported in  1930,the Committee on Empire Migration, which reported in  1931, and the. Committeeon Cattle Diseases,  which reported  in 1934.     6.   The members of the two main standing committees are almost exclusively drawn from the personnel of the Council itself, while those of  the  specialist standing committees and the ad  hoc committees consist partly of members of the Council  and partly of other  persons having  special knowledge or experience of the subject-matter of the inquiry.  The latter are selected from a panel of persons prepared by the Council for the purpose.       [12953-4]
     7.  The reports and work of the Council and of its committees are confidentialexcept in such cases as the Council may advise the Prime Minister otherwise.A number of reports, including those of the Committees named in paragraph 5above, have been published in this way.     8.  The Council, as its name indicated, is  purely advisory, and  any actionarising  out of its. work is  taken on the  sole responsibility  of  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, which is advised by whatever may be  the appropriate GovernmentDepartment.  The Council has  no administrative functions (other than the dutyof advising the Prime  Minister in regard to the  appointment  of government representatives at international scientific congresses  held in foreign countries andthe Dominions). The Secretariat of the Council work in the closest collaboration with the  departments  interested  in the matters  which form the  subject of investigations  either  by  the  Council  or  by  its  committees.   By  such  close collaboration,  the Council aims at  securing a concerted  study of economic and scientific problems of national interest, without in any way interfering with thefunctions  or responsibilities  of  Ministers or of the departments over which theypreside.     9.  The functions of the Council are set out in a Treasury Minute, dated the27th January, 193Q, a copy of which is attached hereto as annex 2.  The functionsof the (earlier) Committee of Civil Research which, as has  been  explained, hasbeen  absorbed  by  the  Council,  are set  out  in  a Treasury  Minute  dated the13th June, 1925, a copy of which is attached hereto as annex  3.ANNEX 1ECONOMIC ADVISORY COUNCIL.
