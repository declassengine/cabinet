     Part I of the Coal Mines Act, 1950,&apos; authorised themaking of schemes for regulating the production, supply and sale of coal by owners of coal mines.  The schemes fororganised selling now being prepared by the coal industry inaccordance with the undertakings given as part of the settle-men t in the recent dispute will also be put Into force underPart I.     In 1932, Part I of the Coal Mines Act, 1930, (which wasto expire at the end of 1932) was continued until the end of1937.     Under present legislation, therefore, the schemes fororganised selling cannot be given a longer statutory life than18 months.  The colliery owners have pointed out that It isvery difficult to make proper plans to set up and workorganisations which may come to an end in so short a time.Moreover, in a number of coal mining districts the ownersintend to appoint full time independent officers of somestanding to administer the selling schemes.  If it is notpossible to offer them a certainty of employment for more than18 months there will be considerable difficulty in securingthe right type of man.     The Secretary for Mines accordingly suggests that Part Tof- the Coal Mines Act, 1930, should now be extended for afurther period of five years from the end of 1937.  I agreewith this suggestion.     A convenient opportunity for this extension will be afforded by the Bill to make effective the  -reorganisation1 sjjgCUMENT IS  THE&apos; PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVTIRNMENT.SECRET.
