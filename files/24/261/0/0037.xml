This document is  the  property  of His Britannic Ma,test ,y&apos;s Government                  Printed for the Cabinet, April, 1936SECRET.                                                                     COPY No. 4 4CP. 107 (36).THE CABINETREMOVAL  OF  PARTS   OF  THE  ROYAL   ORDNANCE                             FACTORIESGeneral 8341      MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR WAR     1. I desire to call the attention of my colleagues  to two points  arising out of the    7^discussion of CP. 93  (36) at the meeting of the Cabinet on 1st April (Cabinet 25 (36),item 8).     2. It is to be remembered that the origin  of the proposal to remove  the  filling factories  from  Woolwich was the incontestable  danger in war of retaining theseinstallations  in  this  very vulnerable  and  crowded  area.   To  operate  the  filling factories in war several hundred tons of high explosive would have to be kept withinthe Factory limits.  It is obvious that to retain a bulk quantity of this magnitude is to endanger lives and property  to an indefensible  extent  and  to imperil the supply ofmunitions to  the Forces.     3. If the Filling Factories are removed from  Woolwich, such removal  cannotbegin in regard to employees until two  and a-half to three years have elapsed.  Thenumber of pivotal men who will be removed is shown in paragraph 4 of the RobinsonReport as 440.  The  number of  semi-skilled personnel who will be thrown  out ofemployment is, on the figures  obtaining at the time  the Report was written, 1,150-440 = 710,^.6., 10 per cent, of the  total of the  Factory  hands.   Since the Report was written the number of employees in the Filling Factories has increased, but it is fair tosay that whatever the number of employees in the  Filling Factories may be at the timeof removal, the percentage of the total Factory employees who will stand to be put  outof employment will be between 10 per cent, and  14 per cent.  It is hoped that manyof these men could be absorbed in the remaining parts of the Factory, especially in viewof the fact that between  3 and 4  per cent, of  the total of employees are turned overannually.   Further, it is to be noted that a  subsidiary object in moving Filling Factorieswas to create employment in areas which  are depressed, and it seems inevitable that iffresh employment be created  in one place by such a removal, a measure of unemploy-ment in the other must be anticipated at any rate for a time.     4. The social effects of the removal of pivotal men  are set  forth in paragraphs 5and 6 of the  Robinson Report and attention is drawn  to the last lines of page 8 of  theReport which reads as follows :          &quot; The question of  housing, however, is one  which should  be the  subject of     detailed  examination nearer the time of transfer in the light of the inadequacy of     the housing conditions.&quot;That will be  in some  two years&apos; time.     It may be noted, as regards the employment of men who stand  to be  dischargedon the removal of any portion of the Factories, that there are very large fluctuations inemployment  quite apart  from any  causes of  removal,  e.g.t in  the  last two yearsemployees have been increased by some 3,400.     5. A decision in regard  to the removal of the  Cordite Factory from WalthamAbbey is urgently required.   The Hacking Report which stressed the early removal inthe following words :  &quot;We should without hesitation recommend that  no manufacturing
activities should remain at Woolwich, Enfield or Waltham &quot; was before the Committeeof  Imperial  Defence   and  approved in  principle  by them on 16th  April,  1935(269th Meeting).   It was before the Cabinet on 31st July, 1935 (CP. 145 (35)).     The Cabinet  did not approve the removal  in  principle, but directed the RobinsonCommittee to report on &quot; the best site for the Cordite Factory at Waltham whenever itshould  be decided to  move  it.&quot;    The Robinson Committee has  made a  definiterecommendation in this respect ; and in paragraphs 9 and  10  have made recommenda-tions with regard to  the  personnel.   It is to be observed that  the  vulnerability  ofWaltham in war is almost equally as great as that of the Filling Factories at woolwich and the danger involved no  less.   Further,  unless  a very early  decision  to  removeWaltham be reached, a capital outlay  of some   117,000 on  existing buildings,  &amp;c,which has been postponed during these discussions will be required.   In war, Walthamcan only produce  200 tons of cordite W a week as against the  500  tons calculated to  berequired from  the new Factory and  there is no possibility of extension  at Walthamitself.     6.  I hope that the foregoing information will convince my colleagues that no unduehardship will be caused by the proposed removal from Woolwich and  I also ask  thatthe War Office may be authorized to take steps to carry  out  the recommeudation  tomove from Waltham to Bishoptou.&apos;                                                                        D.  C.THE WAR OFFICE,       6th April, 1936.CB36/8) 70 4/36 W.OJP. 9434
