Augusty 1981 at 5op,m0)MY LOIDS AHD 1EBUBSR8 021 THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,The Session of Parliament which closes today has been marked by events of great importance for tho welfare of the British Empire and the peaoe of the worlds   It is not yet possible to say that peaoe is firmly established in Europe, and it must be long before the world can recover from the strain and sacrifice of tho War; but good progress has been made towards the solution of the most critical problems of hrome and foreign affairs*I have welcomed with deep satisfaction the Prime Ministers of the Dominions and the Representatives of India who have been in conference with my Advisers here6 They had questions of great moment to discuss in common and grave decisions to malce. Their presence for that purpose has been invaluable, and I trust that it may be found possible to arrange regular meetings of a lite character for the exchange of views and the discussion of common interests*Thoir deliberations on foreign policy doalt in particular with tho problems of tho Pacific and Far Bast and with the questions arising out of the Empire^ obligations under the Treaty of Versailles and the other Treaties of Peace,
I am happy to know that on all the30 issues My Governments horo and oversea are in close accord.The Conference gave serious attention to tho defence of the Umpire and the maintenance of an adequate measure of sea-power.   It ma unanimously decided that the. naval strength of the ^pire should be equal to that of any other Power*With regard to the Pacific, communications have passed between My Government and that of Japan,   The Anglo-Japanese Agreement remains in force until one year after notice of denunciation has been given.   To bring the Agreement into harmony with the League of nations, formal notification ha3 beon made by the two Governments to the League to tho effect that wherever the terms of the Agreement are inconsistent with those of tho Covenant of the League, the latter shall prevail0My Government regard the maintenance of their close and intimate relationship&quot;with the Japanese Government, their Allies of so many years standing, as a powerful element in theiijpolicy of maintaining the peace and political stability of the iar East,   But this attitude is   consistent with an. equally firm conviction that the aims which they have at heart can be more effectually achieved by the cordial co-operation of the Government of the United States of America.It was therefore with particular satisfaction, as tending towards the same goal of international amity, that I learnt of the invitation extended to My Government by the President of the United States to attend a Conference at Washington in the forthcoming autumn to discuss the limitation of armaments together with the question of the Pacific and of the Jar East. Any measures tending to promote the reduction of armaments
and of the burden of taxation must command the fullest sympathy both of myself and of My Government.    It is a source of gratification to me that My Government have been able cordially to accept President Harding!s invitation, and it ., will be their sincere desire to contribute to its success.The situation in Upper Silesia, vhich after&apos;the.result of tho plebiscite-awaited:the final decision of tho Powers, was, unfortunately, complicated by a serious insurrection oh tho part of the Polish inhabitants of that region.   Tho return of the British troops, vhich had been temporarily withdrawn^ helped in the suppression of this movement and in tho vindication of the authority of the Allied Commission. In the Conference which took place last week in Paris My Ministers endeavoured, in conjunction with their Allies,- ; to arrive at an equitable determination of the frontier line. But in viow of the difficulties that presented ther.bC Ires, it was decided to remit the entire question to the Council of the League of Nations, upon whose competence- and:authority, the Ailied Powers were unanimously content to rely.The efforts made by My Government at the Allied Conference in March, arid renewed in June, to establish peace in the Near East were in eaoh case rendered fruitless by the renewal of ... hostilities between the Greek and Turkish forces in Anatolia. It is My earnest desire to see these hostilities followed by an early and Just peace, and My Government may bo relied upon to take the hrst opportunity of furthering this end.The Treaty of Peace between the Allied Powers and Hungary has been ratified,Negotiations are now in progress between My Government and a delegation nominated by H.H, the Sultan of Egypt with a view to determining, the future relationship ofthtt^3-
country with Great Britain.   It is My sincere hope that those negotiations will result in an agreement equally satisfactory and honourable to both countries.Progress is beinff made in the reduotion of expenditure In Meacpstamia in accordance with tho policy whioh has been explained in the House.MEMBERS OF *CH3 HOUSE 0? COMMONS.I thank you for the provision made for the public service and the redemption of debt.   Although trade and commerce have been undergoing a period of unexampled depression, 1 learn with satisfaction that the revenue of the country has shown remarkable steadiness, and in spite of the very exceptional loss and expenditure caused by the coal stoppage it is anticipated that, while the estimated Burplus will not be realised, the financial year will end without a deficit on the Budget.Our  ebta, however, are great, our taxation heavy and burdensome to industry, and revenue cannot be main-tained on tho scale of the last three years.   It is, accordingly, of vital importance to the financial stability of the country that expenditure should be still further restricted in every department of life, both public and private.   The Government Will oontfnua t* take advantage of every possible means to achieve this essential object in the field of public expend!turo,and I confidently rely upon my people in their own practice to support the efforts cf My Ministers-.-MY LORDS AND MBMBSRS OP THS HOUSE OB1 COMMONS.Ihe situation in Ireland still causes ma great anxiety.-, I earnestly exhort the leaders of all Parties -in Ireland and all those in whose hands lies the p*wer to influence the negotiations......
Illand discussions now proceeding to exercise, patience and moderation with the object of establishing friendship- and loyal co-operation between my peoples.   It is my firm belief, as it is my earnest prayer, that with forbearance and good-will and with an honest resolve to tread the paths of oblivion and forgiveness, an enduring peace will finally be achieved.The past summer has been notable for the occurrence of the greatest industrial conflict which has ever menaced the prosperity of the realm.   I take pride in the calm and serene spirit with which the trials of the coal stoppage were mot by My people, and the freedom from strife and; violence which Characterised its course.   And X derive great hope from the form of settlement which ultimately brought this great calamity to a close   a settlement which,- in the greatest industrial occupation of the country, makes the workman for the future a sharer in the prosperity of the industry and identifies tie success of the colliery with the progress and advancement of the miner.This dispute unhappily aggravated the adverse effect of the sudden world-wide trade depression, but the timely measures which you have passed relating to -Unemployment Insur-ance have mitigated in no inconsiderable degree the conse-quent distress.   The peaceful settlement of many other dis-putes by mutual negotiation between employers and workpeople, together,with the indications of a revival of trade, encourage My hope that the worst is over and that the state of employ-ment will continue to show steady improvement.   But the position is still full of anxiety, and My Ministers will continue to devote to this problem their vigil and care.
The legislation of the session has been dominated by the difficult financial condition of the time. The imperative need for the avoidance of all fresh burdens and for the further curtailment of expenditure has required the modification of some measures already passed and the post ? to happier times of the completion of other reforms.

An Act has been passed for the re-organisation of the railways on terms conducive to their more efficient and economical working as well as to the avoidance of Labour disputes and the satisfaction of the travelling and  commercial public.

A measure has been passed to deal with the safeguarding of essential key industries of the country and with certain aspects of unfair and abnormal industrial competition.

An Act for the reform of the Licensing laws was passed with an unusual and gratifying measure of agreement.

I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your labours.
