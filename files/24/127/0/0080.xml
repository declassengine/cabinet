Their lead is &quot;beginning to be followed in the provinces, where the &quot;Unemployment Committees&quot; are linked to London headquarters.This development is largely the outcome of George Lensbury&apos;s advice to &quot;Go to the Guardians&quot; which has b*on preached by him and by his paper since January,There appears to be no power to check the ruinous extravagance of Labour Guardians, unless the ratepayers themselves^ organise an opposition.The Poplar Councillors, who concluded their business last night by singing the &quot;Red Flag,1&apos; expect to go to prison to-day arid it is possible. that a rent strike of the Borough will follow. There can be no doubt that Lansbury, Vaughan and other extremists hope to effect, through wild finance, that chaos which Is considered a nooeeeary prelude to a revolution.The Communist &quot;Famine Week&quot; was a failure.Extracts are given from an interesting letter written by Sylvia Pankhuret.Most of the shares in the victoria Printing House Company will shortly be taken over by Mr. Lansbury or his nominees.Indications now point to. acceptance of the Government offer by Sinn Fein after the usual attermptat bargaining.
THE) UMBI-tPLOYBDIn London tho situation created by extremist influence on the unemployed is becoming grave,     It will be remembered that on January 22nd, George Lansbury published an article in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; in-which ho advised the unernployod to &quot;Go to the Guardians&quot; (vide my report Ho. 90), which was subsequently reprinted in leaflet form and widely distributed. This advice has beon consistently preached by Lansbury in his paper and on the platform, ha3 been practised in Poplar and adopted by the London District Council of Unemployed. The result is now apparent in Bothnal Green, Camberwoll, Islington, Berraondsoy, Hoi bom, r&apos;insbury, and Clerkenwell, whero the organised demands of the unemployed have resulted in increased reliof which must provo an intolerable burden to. tho ratepayers *     To-day similar demands will be made in Woolwioh and Hammersmith:     the relief granted amounts to  4.8,0. per week in Bermondsey; in Pinsbury and Clerkonwell no limit appears to have beon made and in other boroughs relief amounts to more per family than would be earned in many cases by unskilled labour and its demoralising effect needs no emphasis.The following is a summary of the claims made upon the guardians of which three have been conceded.     It applies to the scale for man, - wife, and size children.AdoptedCamberv/ell Islington ,BermondseyDemandedHackney Shoreditoh Holborn  .

Although the circulation of tho &quot;Dally Herald&quot; has fallen,tho paper reaches most of the poorer districts of London and its influence is all in th* direction of incitement:     the following extract is taken from an article published on August 27th bythe &quot;Special Commissioner&quot;f who is responsible for tho articlesmentioned in my last report?&quot;Strong, willing-1o-wOrlc rwn and women, with nothing&apos; to do, no food and no hope, cannot be lightly disregarded, They aro on the verge of despair.&quot;Will the 30,000 of Glaphara, Brixton and the Borough, tho 16,0^0 of Cwaoerwoil, tho 20,0X) Of Poplar, tho 20,000 of Shoroditoh, the 22, 000 of Stepney, and the tens of   &quot; thousands from Vaiham Green to Woolwich, Shop herd&apos;a Bush, Bdgware, St* Pancras, Marylebone, Islington, Holloway, and Hacknoy, remain in their homos stifforing the pangs of hunger and calmly await death?&quot;17111 thooe thousands be silent, or will they rise in thoir mighty battalions end assert their right to live?&quot;I have boon permitted to visit scores of poverty-striken hones in London, north, south, oast and west, whoa 1 have seen the unemployed bravely trying to exist en 15s. par wook,&quot;1 have heard pathetic stories of the ghastly struggli against adversity, and I have gathered thoir opinions on&apos; those whom they blame for thoir troubles.15Every day the problem grows more serious and if the Government does not immediately prepare a sohome to 1 ameliorate the conditions of the London unemployed, very serious oonsoquonoos aro to bo foarod0&quot;It scorns clear that Mr. Lansbury has committed an offense by inciting to the commission of a breach of the law and tho question of prosecuting him will doubtless be considered.There is ample evidence to show that the communists, throt the medium of the London District Council of Unemployed, are largely responsible for the present unrest. There is reason t believe that the London District Council is a branea of th&amp; International Federation of Unemployed which has groups in ltd Franco, Switzerland, Belgium and Germany: the Federation taJfli its orders from Soviet Russia and its ob^eot is &quot;to prepare W unemployed for the World Revolution.nKannlngtoa/
Banning ton, a member of tho Communist Party, and London Organ! sex* of tho Unemployed, stated at Ho:cton on August 24th, that the unemployed v/ero now boooming organised in almost every London borough:   thoso borough organisations v;ero linked up with the London District Unemployed Federation and recently a national Administrative Council of Unemployed was formed, which takes &quot; in boroughs 300 and 400 miles apart.     who demonstrations in Sheffield a few days ago, emanated from the deliberations of this council.     He then instanced, two oases where organisation had obtained for tho unemployed advances in wagos and out-door relief. At Bi-.3ingstoke, where the unemployed were receiving Is.       , per hour on work for tho borough council, they had their wages advanced to Is. 7d. per hour (the recognised trade union rate) as a result of their organising and making a consolidated demand upon the Counoil.   At Bethnal Greon, whore tho out-door relief had been reduced by the Guardians, a deputation of the local unemployed organisation waited upon the Board of Guardians last week with the result that the scale of out-door relief has been considerably Increased.Harming ton and Jennott, who obtained notoriety in the Islington riot last year, were two of tho deputation who successfully interviewed tho Islington Guardians on August 26th;     Jennett said at a preliminary meeting, that he was afraid the unemployed were not yet hungry enough to make themselves a nuisanooj    it was, however, apparent that in the event of tho Guardians not giving either work or adequate relief vigorous efforts would be made during tho winter months, He added that it was up to the men to hold themselves in readiness if thoy wished, to succeed.   About 2,000 people assembled during the interview with the Guardians and were subsequently addressed by Honing ton in his capacity as London Organiser;   he urged them not to break away from.tho organisation, but. to stand by the men who are fighting for them.Unemployed moetings have been reported from Bethnal Green;-;     -       &apos; sea-------So mop,&apos;k-&amp;s* &amp;c**a -&quot;*:**4g$[iyfe/ -

On August 29th, at Highbn the speaker, Marsden, said that ho was a member of the Coamuti Party and that the unemployed should know that the comnunlata leading thomj   the chairman stated that bills announcing futii meetings would be posted at the Labour Srohaage,     On August it was announced at a meeting hold at Yfestcrham Hoad that the Leyton and District Unemployed Committee intended to organise march to the local authorities to demand the same scale of re as had boon granted in various London boroughs*   The attendaa these meetings has varied from 100 to 500*Prom the provinces there arc indications that the osganii of the unemployed by extremists Is proceeding apace;-   at She fa which has already otme into prominence, a few single men, inoll the Rev. - Pickering, have gone into the workhouse, but offortj to demonstrate were frustrated by the presence of the police: August 24th, Northampton unemployed demonstrated. In connection relief work and there have been demonstrations in Colchester a Bristoln     My correspondents are of opinion that the digturban at Sheffield were the forerunners of trouble in other large industrial centres:   in Coventry the unemployed are again beginning to meet in large numbers on Pool Meadow and a oommil is being organised,     Dingley and Ode11 have refused to offiol on the ground that the unemployed were &quot;too apathetic&quot; last wlij hut other extremists have been found and tho crowds are in an mood.     In Nottingham many of the unemployed have exhausted th] period for unemployment benefit and are said to be faced with starvation unless tho Guardians afford rollsf* In Birrnlngfcfim, Wolverhampton and Smethwiok also the number of unemployed v/HG exhausted their benefit is increasing:   men are still being dismissed from sections of the engineering trade.    At Smethflfilast/

Tho situation was easod when it was announced in: at the Ministry was prepared to roooive a deputation.is      The Birmingham communists aro doing their best to exploit tho^employed, though their efforts can scarcely be said to be aaancial suocoss:   on August  8th tho first co Hoot ion at a meeting a lallsed 7d* and the second Id.

I want to warn you that there will be no work for you this coming winter and the &apos;ff     Capitalists are stopping your do Los.   What are you going to dothen?   Are you prepared to starve?

On the other hand, there is groat satisfaction at the settlement of the joiners1 strike and the prospects of Mersey side are considered very &apos;Sood.     In Newcastle, although trade is bad, unemployment has slightly decreased and&apos;there have been no demonstrations recently.The Glasgow unomployed are showing signs of activity, thaspjes to the propaganda of John McLean find his Unemployed Committee: &amp;a August 28th the largest orowd (about 000) my correspondents, have, soon for some time, assembled on Glasgow Green to hear &quot;Sandy&quot; Boss, Peter Marshall and others.

HPOPLARDuring the week several well attended meetings have bjaddressed by the Poplar 3orough Councillors, with GeorgeLansbury well to the fore.,   The case for the Council has bset out In detail and in almost identical terms at eachmeeting, great stress being laid upon the necessity for&quot;equalisation of rates&quot;.,     The councillors evidently intendgo to prison and have advised their electors as to the couibe followed in their absence,     John Scurr said at Cubitt ion August 24th:-&quot;When Tie go to Brixton no authority can legally collect rates Tie have not levied, and If anyone tries collect the; Central Authorities&apos; rates from you &quot;it is1 to you to refuse., There is just one provision,&apos; howeT and that -is &apos;tho Metropolitan Police; the Commissioner the Metropolitan Police may legally appoint two- person to collect rates, but this would be a slow joS7 s*nd I think you would find a way of escaping that.&quot;George Lansbury&apos;s advice goes further. &apos; He was one ofspeakers at the Tower Hill deignstratiOn on August 28th wheaccording to his own papert he said:&quot;When we are inside, don1t get up to any monkey I /-tricks by breaking tho law.   Theresa one perfectly siil way to back us up.   We are going to strike against rail you -start a gigantic strike against rent.v.-&quot;Every employed and unemployed man- should refuse pay rent till we come but  and have won this fight.

in procession from Bethnal Green, Stepney and Shoreditch, to the rendes-vous.     The chairman (Sam March, Mayor of Poplar) said that they were making a stand against the Government in its attitude towards the unemployed.   Immediately the question of unemployed he came acute the Borough Council put work in hand to employ as many as possible, and the Board of Guardians paid relief to the others:    in July last 15,335 unemployed were on the relief list-   They had to find the money to meet these calls and it is impossible to raise the rates in order to be able to pay the precepts of the Metropolitan Water Board, Metropolitan Asylums Board, L.C.C. and the Metropolitan Police. The Council are the people responsible for collecting themoney and although they pointed out to the Government months.- ::-&quot;:./;,     .        .  &quot;        -they -ago that the present situation would arise  /   received nothing in amelioration.   The amount due is approximately  300,000,the Council could not get  100,000s, but if it were only  3   \they would not raise it.    &quot;Wo are receiving letters ofencouragement from all over the country and we hope, by our action, that other boroughs will fall into line and follow ourexample.&quot; Ysughah, Mayor of Bethnal Green, said that now Poplar had taken the lead he hoped that the other London boroughs would follow suit.    He was with them in spirit and itthe people stood behind their leaders, victory would&apos;ensue.The movement to resist the payment of rates ispotentially-mischievous:    the. Poplar councillors have undoubtedly a large following in their own borough and it ispossible: that their advice regarding the;,non-payment- of rent and.. taxes will -be.--followed.    There is, moreover, a good deal ofsympathetic feeling in other east-end boroughs and the situation may become,extremely difficult *..COMMbTgIST3Despite an abnormal number of meetings the &quot;RussiansWorkersT/
Workers&apos; Week&quot; organised by the Conmtunist Party has failed: the collections, though more in many cases than those resulting from ordinary meetings, have in the provinces rarely amounted t  1 per meeting.   The London campaign culminated in a meeting in Trafalgar Square on august 20th when about  20 was thrown on tb plinth:    the audience varied from 500 to 2,000 but only about 300 appeared to sympathise with the speakers, who included E. Bishop, J.J. &quot;Vaughan, W, MeL&amp;ine, and Bert Joy*In London and In the provinces the speeches wore evidently taken from a &quot;model&quot; supplied from headquarters, which eulogised the Soviet regime, and exonerated the Bolsheviks from any responsibility in connection with the famine, the blame for which was laid at the door partly of the dreught but mainly of the Allied Governments..     In a great many cases, moreover, the appeals for money were half-hearted, and in seme,almost apologel There seemed to be a general  ealing that charity should begin at homa and that hungry Britishers should take precedence of starving Russians..   On several occasions the audience voiced til sentiment in unmistakable terms *Among some documents intercepted abroad Is an interestingletter written by Sylvia Pankhurst:   dealing first with her own affairs she says;&quot;We can*t pay anyone fer anything.   We sell the Mo scows instead of giving.     It was always a hard struggle: We were driven away from printer after printer by Government interference.   We g$t together money to buy a Press.     The machinery cost aver  4,000, I paid  20 the otl day.     There is still another  60 owing, the last machine &apos; be paid for, and I owe about  80 for type.^ 500 had to he found to stop a crash. 1 had heen premised  5,000 for propaganda by the Third International. I borrowed the  500 en the security of the machinery.   The man who lent it, a good man, lent it for four months.    TH time expired while I was in prison.     He still waits hut he grumbles and threatens and some day he will cease to wait,    A friend promised 7 per cent interest on the money if I could borrow it for two years.     He even has bought a policy for that amount enabling the holder to draw the interest half yearly, but so far I have not been able to draw the  500.&quot;Meanwhile/&quot;
&quot;Meanwhile tho Communist Party has organised a &quot;boycott of the Dreadnought a *&quot;At home the gas is cut off, the rates are not paid and the water will be cut off any day.

Communist. Party of GreatBritain are Illuminating and oan be accepted as correct, althoughdoubtless the writer&apos;s mind Is warped by jealousy:&quot;In this country the Cowamnist Party has largely fallen into the hands of the *Daily Heraldv group, which le not Communist and will certainly fail in a crisis.. &quot;I think it is a scandal that officials of the Communist Party should be paid far higher-salaries than they could possibly ever get outside;     that there should , be a paid cartoonist besides tw paid editors *   That is &apos;&apos;&apos; hut-&apos; one: feature - of a movement that is built up too largely with foreign money *     If Russian money wrs to cease there would he a most terrible collapse in the Comtsunlst Party.&quot;Yet&apos;wa&quot;have faithful readers, even to-day our circulation is larger than that of * The Call *, when the United Party was formed - but they were then subsidized by -Russian money *-*As for the general situation, unemployment is very grave, rents are -rising, food prices remain high.     The situation has possibilities but the work Of preparation is very scanty.,     If the  1000 the Communist Party spent in the last six months in subsidising what is to a large extent a mere&apos;drinking place called the International Socialist Club, had been put into propaganda amongst the unemployed, the money would have been better spent.&quot;Preparations are still being made for the &quot;Red Week&quot;(September 7th - 15th) of communist agitation and propaganda which Moscow has ordered, but ,there is..little reason to suppose that it will be more -successful than &quot;famine.

In spite of discouragement last week, when Sovietbuttons proved almost unsaleable although reduced from 3d. toEd., has ordered 200.000 leaflets;    the local officials suggestthat 50,000 shall apply to the unemployed, 75,000.to theengineering and shipbuilding workers, and 75,000 to the miners:alternatively/
- io -alternatively they propose that the numbers for the last two categories shall be reduced, and the residue devoted to railway workers and municipal employees.   .Jack Lcekie, who v/as liberated on August 18th, has offered his services to the&quot; Coaisuniat Party in any capacity: he stated in an appreciative letter that, although his health was not good, he felt that he must start work at once in order to repay the kindness shown to him by the Party during his impri sonment.The Communist attempt to keep out the labour-candidate... at Caerphilly was unsuccessful..

VBefore the poll the Welsh District Council of the CommParty sent to headquarters a series of suggestions.in regard.   to Parliamentary activity, the last of which bears quotation&quot;The Committee recommends to. the E.C. that it should consider the advisability of issuing some statement to the Press and Public of the number of seet to be fought by the Party at next general, election, and the advisability of exaggerating the number   to be fought for advertisement and publicity purposes.&quot;THE BSD TRADE TJtLTON INTERNATIONAL -The officials of tho British Bureau are endeavouring tn make the most of the funds still at their disposal and have arranged to hold 15 meetings, to be addressed by &quot;star&quot; speakers, during September.

fails, as the estreiaiWs know quite woll that the feolingof tho country is overwhelmingly in favour of accepting Dominion status.Tho drawing out of the negotiations is welcomed hy the &quot;Republic1 not only because it gives time to re-organise their civil and military departments, but beoause it is hoped that England will drift into tho way of acknowledging a Sinn Fein Republic, as it is claimed she has dona at the present by acknowledging a Government and an ,Army.Another example of the effect of Communist propaganda from Moscow has appeared at Bruree, County Limerick, where the bakery and mill, belonging to Messrs. Oleeve have been seized by workmen, members of the IrishTransport Workers&apos;.. Union vho have hoisted a Red Flag over the entrance and are selling bread at a Id. less than tho market price. .. Over the entrance is a.notice &quot;Bruree Soviet Workers&apos;v Mills.. We make bread, not profits&quot; and a poster informs the public, that mill and bakery &quot;are now the property of the workers.&quot;
