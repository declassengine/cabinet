As was to be expected a large part of the early proceedings was devoted to the consideration of the unemployment position, but no new constructive proposals emerged from the discussion. Some time was also spent on an attack upon the Ministry of Labour&apos;s index number. A noteworthy circumstance was the presence of delegates from the National Union of Distributive and Allied workers (the successor of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees) which is now affiliated to the Congress. An unexpected demand at the Congress for a shorter working week, coupled with Mr. Thomas&apos; plea for the retention of the 48-hour week on the Irish Railways, and Mr. Hicks&apos; recent call to the defence of the 44-hour week in the building trades, point to the likelihood of a stronger resistance on the part of labour to an &quot; attack on hours &quot; than to the &quot; attack on wages.&quot;The agitation on the part of the unemployed for increased poor relief, which was referred to last week, has now spread from London to other parts of the country. Apart from this there is a marked absence of serious labour troubles, and the printing trade remains the sole important centre of unrest, although no stoppage has yet developed.The improvement in the unemployment position, as shown by the live register totals, is steadily maintained. The estimated total of the live register of all Employment Exchanges on 2nd September was 1,527,500 as compared with 1,575,800, the^ corresponding figure for the previous week.(34599-31)  Wt. 78   300 9/21  H.

10.9.21102FEATURES   OF   THE   WEEK.General Topics.Unemployment. During the past week the unemployed in London and the provinces have been very active, and there have been many demonstrations and deputations to Boards of Guardians in various parts of the country. These demonstrations and deputations recall those held in September and October, 1920, in the London Boroughs and in various industrial towns, which culminated on 18th October, 1920, in a deputation of London Mayors to the Prime Minister and a demonstration in Whitehall.* The Trades Union Congress, to which reference is made below, have also received a deputation of unemployed men, and held a long debate on the subject.A Committee of the unemployed at Shoreditch have decided to recommend the acceptance of an offer made by the Guardians last week for out-relief on a scale not exceeding AH a week for a man and his family: A similar scale is also to be accepted by the unemployed at Woolwich. Camberwell Guardians have refused to accede to the demand that relief shall be paid at the rate of  1 per week each for a man and his wife and 7s. Gel. for each child, and a protest meeting was held at which the unemployed threatened to claim admission to the workhouse-. A town&apos;s meeting was held on 6th September at Bermondsey Town Hall to discuss the question, and a resolution was passed declaring that a solution of the unemployed problem could only be furnished by the State. At Greenwich and at Hammersmith, the Boards of Guardians could only offer relief at much lower scales than those offered by the Shoreditch and Woolwich Guardians, and this has caused considerable discontent, though no action has yet been taken by the unemployed.At Bristol, the Gtiardians offered relief at the rate of 25s. per week for a man and his wife, 5s. for each child to a maximum of 40s. per week, 15s. for a single man and 12s. 6d. for a single woman, and this offer was accepted by the unemployed. At Walsall the Guardians have offered relief on a scale not exceeding A3 5s. per week, and have asked the Ministry of Health for their sanction. The Middlesbrough Guardians have received a demand for relief as follows :-15s. each for a man and wife, 5s. for each child, 1 cwt. of coal for each household, rent to be paid out of Poor Law funds, and no one to be sent to the workhouse.A deputation representing the Smethwick Town Council and the Birmingham Board -of Guardians has visited the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Health. The increased allowances proposed by the Birmingham Guardians are stated to have been approved by the latter Department.At a meeting of the Welsh Coal Conciliation Board, held at Cardiff on 2nd September, the question was raised of a deduction being made from the wages of the workmen to assist -unemployed workmen. The owners stated that this could only be done if each individual workman signed an authority showing his willingness to consent to the deduction, and the workmen&apos;s representatives intimated that they were unable to accept this condition. Further consideration of the matter was therefore deferred. It will be remembered that the special unemployment levy scheme of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, first outlined in March this year, included a provision that, if possible, the contributions from the miners in work should be collected from their wages at the colliery pay offices, apparently on. the authority of district conference resolutions.A mass meeting of unemployed was held at Dundee, and a visit was made to the Parish Council offices, but no deputation was received and some disturbance ensued. The position in this town is reported to be very serious as the Relief Committee is now practically without funds. Considerable distress is also reported among the Fifeshire miners, many of whom are unable to find employment owing to the flooding of mines during the recent stoppage, and a deputation visited the Scottish Board of Health on 2nd September to make a request for special measures of relief. The Board promised that the representations made by the deputation should be forwarded to the proper quarter, and that steps should be taken to place the facts before the public authorities concerned.The Use of Lead Paints. The Home Secretary has appointed a Committee to re-examme, in view of further information which has become available since the enquiries* See this Report, Vol. II, Nos. 14-17, 2nd to 23rd October, 1920.
of the Departmental Committees appointed in 1911, the question of the danger from the-use of lead paints to workers in the painting trades ; the comparative efficiency and cost, and the effect on the health of the workers, of paints containing lead and leadless paints,, respectively ; and to advise whether any modifications of the conclusions and recommenda-tions of those Committees have become necessary. The Committee consists of the-following members Major the Right Hon. Sir Henry Norman, Bt., M.P. (Chairman), Mr.Gerald Bellhouse, C.B.E., Mr.O. J. Kauffman, M.D., Mr. Thos. M. Legge, C.B E.,M.D., Mr. A. Munby, F.R.I.B.A., Mr. A. Scott, F.K.S., D.Sc, and Mr. H. C. Weller.The question of the prohibition of the use of white lead in-painting is to be con-sidered at the International Labour Conference, which meets at Geneva on October 25th. In this connection the London Chamber of Commerce have issued a statement of the &quot; Case against Prohibition.&quot;Industrial Organisations.Trades Union Congress. The Trades Union Congress opened at Cardiff on 5th September under the presidency of Mr. E. L. Poulton. In his address Mr. Poulton somewhat unexpectedly advocated shorter hoars of labour on the ground that facilities for producing goods were never more abundant or efficient than to-day. He referred to the adverse effect of the industrial depression on the. finances of trade unions, and warned the unions to expect an even more trying time during the coming winter. He suggested, that the workers would be well advised to make the fullest use of the co-operative move-&apos; ment, and recommended that the General Council should always be consulted when a dispute on a large scale was expected.The proceedings of the first two days were overshadowed by the unemployment problem. On Monday afternoon the Congress received a deputation from the unemployed. Speeches were made by J. W. Holt, Edwin Pitt and W. Maclean, the latter of whom advocated a general strike as :&apos; the only lever.&quot; The speakers were emphatic that unless the unemployed received help from the organised workers they would take direct action. The. debate on unemployment and the position in Poplar was taken on Tuesday afternoon by special arrangement. The president moved a composite resolution embodying the main points of a number of resolutions on the agenda. In the terms of the resolution, Congress viewed with grave apprehension the increasing extent of, and conditions of&apos; unemployment, reaffirmed the principle that it -was the duty of the State to provide work &quot;or maintenance, and considered that the burden of unemployment, mainly due to the war, should not. be placed on the ratepayers. &apos; The resolution called upon thef Government immediately to summon Parliament, to introduce practicable schemes of work without delay, and to remove the inequalities of rating obtaining in the London area. Finally the resolution instructed the new General Council to co-operate with the National Executive of the Labour Party and with the Parliamentary Labour Party in action to secure the objects of the resolution.The resolution was seconded by Mr. Gosling who wanted the Government to use the machinery of the Unemployed Workmen Act of 1905. Mr. Bevin, while giving due weight to world-wide causes, diagnosed the fundamental cause of the trouble as the-financial basis of the capitalist system. Messrs. Jack Jones, M.P., Ben Turner, J. R. Clynes, M.P;, and Ben Tillett, M.P., also spoke. Mr. Clynes speech was in effect a call&apos; for organised demonstration and demand on such a scale as to compel the attention of Parliament.The resolution was carried unanimously.Much attention was given on Tuesday to the cost of living and the relative merits of the Ministry of Labour&apos;s index number and that, of the Labour Joint Committee. Mr. Bowen (Post Office Workers), who initiated the discussion, hinted that in endeavour -ing to show the inaccuracy of the official figure the Labour Joint Committee had under-taken a big task, and asked whether the Cornmittee&apos;s Report was based upon conditions sufficiently stable to allow of the official figure being challenged with confidence. The resolution, which was moved by Mr. J. H. Thomas, called attention to the high cost of living, and the discrepancy between the index number of the Labour Joint Committee and that of the Ministry of Labour. It condemned the Government for refusing to publish the results of important inquiries into profits^ demanded legislation to deal with the &quot; continued growth of uncontrolled trusts and combines,&quot; and expressed the opinion that the exploitation of the consumer was inevitable under1 the present industrial system3459a A 2
Mr. Thomas said that the movements shown by the official cost of living figures were contrary to the experience of the great mass of the people in the country, and Mr. A. Shaw (National Society of Dyers), who seconded the resolution, criticised the method of the Ministry of Labour in obtaining data through the employment exchanges.The resolution was carried.Other resolutions passed on Monday and Tuesday supported pensions for mothers ;, demanded the repeal of the Emergency Powers Act, the nationalisation of railways, and the removal of the embargo upon the importation of Canadian and foreign cattle ; and recommended all affiliated unions to consider proposals that entrants into their trades should be apprenticed to unions instead of individual employers.Earlier in the proceedings, a demand for an inquiry into the breakdown of the Triple Alliance was withdrawn by tlie Building Workers on the ground that the control of the working class movement would in future be vested in the General Council ; while later, a motion instructing the Parliamentary Committee to take the necessary steps to amend the rules of the Joint Committee of Trade Unionists and Co-operators so as to eliminate the principle of compulsory arbitration was shelved, after a somewhat acrimonious debate.It was announced on Tuesday that the work of the Women&apos;s Trade Union League had been taken over as a Department of the new General Council.National Federation of Colliery Surface Workers. The annual meeting of this Federation was held at Sheffield on the 31st August, when the following officers were elected :-Mr. W. Wood (Leeds), Chairman ; Mr. W. H. Proudler, Vice-Chairman ; Mr. A. J. Bailey, Secretary ; Mr. C. H. Blackburn, Treasurer.It was reported that each union in the federation has been able to pay benefit for the whole period of the coal trade dispute in spite of the very heavy expenditure entailed.The unions represented by the Federation were : The National Amalgamated Union of Enginemen, Firemen, &amp;c, the National Union of General Woi*kers, the Workers Union and the National Amalgamated Union of Labour.National Association of Colliery Managers. The annual meeting of the Colliery Managers Association opened at Cardiff on Wednesday, 31st August. The retiring President (Capt. Muschamp) reported that during his period of office the Association had considered, and rejected, proposals to reconstitute itself as a trade union. Following this ^decision the qwners were approached, and a National Joint Council of Coalowners and Colliery Managers was established, and joint committees were set up in every coalfield, with one exception, in the United Kingdom.Mr. John Kane, the new President, gave a survey of the present position of the industry, in which he made one or two interesting points. He said, that allowing for the shorter working day, the output per person since the strike was nearly as high as in 1913. He^remarked also that a reduction in wages alone would not assist in lowering prices, and that to effect any substantial reduction in this direction it was necessary that excessive transport and royalty charges should be reduced. It was also stated that although the Association as a whole had agreed to be represented on the Pit Committees to be set up under the Mining Industry Act, 1920, the South Wales Branch had passed a resolution Tefu&amp;ing to take any part in their establishment or activities.. N.U.R. Signalmen&apos;s Council. The annual conference of the Signalmen&apos;s National Movement was held last week at Bristol, under the chairmanship of Mr. W. J. Richards, The signalmen&apos;s recent settlement was reviewed, and while general dissatisfaction was expressed with the terms, it was realised that they would have to be accepted for the time being. Mr. VV. J. Hichards (Eastleigh),. was re-elected President, Mr. W. H. Pritchard (London), was elected Secretary and Mr. W. Pullinger (London), Treasurer.NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Railwaymen (Ireland). The public proceedings of the Arbitration Tribunal inquiring into the question of standardisation of pay and hours of duty as applied to railway

No. 23.   4th June, 1921.   p. 466.workers were concluded on 31st August.   At the final session of the Tribunal Mr. J. H. Thomas made a strong plea for the retention of the 48-hour week.Tramwaymen (Manchester). The resignation of twenty-one inspectors from the United Vehicle Workers&apos; Union in order to join the National Association of Local Govern-ment Officers threatens to lead to a serious situation on the tramways at Manchester and Salford. By an overwhelming majority the rest of the tramwaymen have decided to withdraw their labour if the inspectors insist on remaining outside the Union. A mass meeting, which the seceding inspectors have been asked to attend, is to be held on the 10th hist, to decide upon the course of action to be taken by the workers.Printers (National).* The Administrative Council of the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation met on 31st August, but was unable to decide upon united action. It is possible, however, that a common policy will be pursued by the skilled unions. A meeting on 1st September of the Federation of Master Printers and representatives of the Newspaper Society, which covers newspaper printing in the provinces, decided to post notices at once intimating a reduction of 7s. 6cl. a week on 24th September for all adult male members of unions with which agreement has not been effected. The proprietor of certain important Birmingham newspapers is stated to be opposed to the reduction.The Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association, with which the London daily papers are associated, is not affected.Bakers (Bolton). A proposal by the employers to reduce the wages of operative bakers by 6s. per week was submitted to a general meeting of the workers concerned on 30th August, when it was decided to inform the employers that under no consideration could a reduction of wages be considered at the present time. The employers have decided to postpone action until the 17th instant, when it is intended to serve notices of the reduction on the workers. A meeting of the employers has been arranged to formulate plans for ensuring the supply of bread to the townspeople in the event of a strike.Co-operative Wholesale Society Employees (National). Although the revised terms offered by the Co-operative Wholesale Society f were rejected by the unions, the first of the two reductions of 5 per cent, was put into force by the Society on the 22nd August without serious opposition. A further meeting on the 30th and 31st August, between the Directors of the Society and representatives of the unions involved did not result in settle-ment, and the Directors have announced their intention of adhering to their revised proposals.   The second reduction of 5 per cent, is due as from 26th September next.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Plasterers (Manchester). The local branch of the National Association of Plasterers refused to accept the reduction in wages due in accordance with the decision of the National Wages and Conditions Council for the Building trade, and the men ceased work on the 19th August. The employers refused to give the plasterers preferential treatment, and threatened a national lock-out. Work was ultimately resumed on 29th August at the reduced rate of 2s. Id. per hour, applicable to tradesmen in federated firms in the North Western Area from 1st August. This rate is subject to a further reduction of \d. per hour from 1st September.Boilermakers (Mersey). The Mersey Shiprepairers&apos; Federation decided to rescind :a local rule requiring the employment of 25 men upon an oxy-acetyleiie burner -which, it is stated, could be worked by two men. The employers contend that this rule is not in operation in other centres.As a result the boilermakers concerned, on the instructions of their Union, have -eeased work.Sheet Metal Workers (Halifax and District.) With a view to terminating a strike of sheet metal workers which began on 18th July last, a conference was held in Halifax
Settlements and Agreements.Building Trade Operatives (Scunthorpe). -The dispute between Messrs. Tarrants, Ltd., of Byfleet, and the bricklayers and other employees engaged on the Scunthorpe Housing Scheme (see last week&apos;s Report, pages 98-9) is now settled. An agreement has been reached whereby the firm undertake that no piecework shall be worked. By their interpretation of the agreement, however, they reserve their right to pay a wage in excess of the local rate as an encouragement towards efficiency.An important factor in the dispute was the attitude of the labourers who had received no recompense for the additional work devolving upon them as a result of the-increased activity of the bricklayers.Limestone Quarry Workers (South Wales). Wages in the limestone quarries in South Wales are regulated by joint conferences between the -South Wales Lime-burners&apos; and Quarry Owners&apos; Association and the Workers Union, the National Union of General Workers, and the National Amalgamated Union of Labour. At a joint meeting held on 29th August to consider the employers&apos; proposal of a reduction of 4d. per hour, it was ultimately agreed that a reduction of 2d. per hour, making a minimum rate of&quot; Is. Id. per hour, should operate as from the first pay day in September. It was also agreed that a further meeting to reconsider the question of wages should be held on 17th October.Moulders (Messrs. Fodens, Sandbach).  A strike of moulders and apprentice moulders, which began on 16th April as the result of a reduction in wages imposed by the employers, has now ended, and the men have returned to work on the employers&apos; terms.Hatters (National). The result of the ballot of members of the felt hatters&apos; unions-on the proposed reduction in bonus (see last week&apos;s Report) shows a majority for acceptance.   It is stated that 70 per cent, of the members voted, and all districts have returned substantial majorities.   The first reduction of 15 per cent, comes iuto force immediately, and a further reduction of 15 per cent, in November.Carters (Exeter). A dispute arising out of a proposal that the wages of carters should be reduced by 5s. per week was referred to the local Conciliation Board, which decided that the reduction was not justifiable. Both sides have accepted the decision,, and the wages of carters (horse transport only being concerned) will continue as follows : Coal carters, 56s. 6d. per week ; local railway contractors&apos; carts, &apos;55s. 6d. ; general carters, 54s. Qd.Saltworkers (National). The strike in the salt trade * terminated on the 30th August, work being resumed next day. The settlement provided, for an immediate reduction^of \\d. per hour for time-workers and 8J per cent, for piece-workers, to be followed byja further reduction of a \d. per hour and 2f per cent, respectively in October.* See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 10, 3rd September, 1921, p. 99.on 1st September, between representatives of the employers and the Sheet Metal Worker&apos;s. Union. The employers wish to reduce wages to Is. 9d. per hour, which approximates to the engineers&apos; rate for the district, and as a compromise they suggested a reduction from the present rate of Is. 10^d. per hour by instalments of %d. in September, JcZ. in October, and %d. in November ; these rates being subject to whatever reduction might be-effected as a result of the national negotiations in the engineering trade on the 12J per cent, bonus (See last week&apos;s Report.) The proposal was declined by the men&apos;s. representatives, who offered to recommend a rate of Is. 9^d. subject to any reduction in the 12^ per cent, bonus. This in turn was declined by the employers, and the meeting closed without a settlement.It is stated that attempts are being made by employers throughout the country to-bring sheet metal workers&apos; rates down to the level of the engineers&apos; rates. Acceptance of the engineers&apos; rate at Halifax would prejudice the sheet metal workers&apos; negotiations else-where, hence the determination of the Union in this case.
Employees in War Office Building Works Departments. A decision dated 5th, September has been given by the Industrial Court concerning rates of wages to be paid to certain workmen employed in the Building Works Department of the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich (including the Army Clothing Department, Pimlico), the Royal Gunpowder Factory, Waltham Abbey, and the Royal Small Arms Factory, Bnfield. The difference arose between the Trade Union side of the Building Trade Joint Council for Govern-ment Industrial Establishments and the War Office over a claim on behalf of skilled tradesmen and labourers, employed on building alterations, repairs and maintenance work generally in the particular War Office establishments, that their rates of wages should be those in force for the building industry in the district in which the various works are situated.In support of their claim the unions submitted that it was the practice for building trade&apos; rates to be paid for similar work by engineering establishments in the London district and by contractors undertaking building constructional work in War Office establishments. The War Office contended that it is the exception and not the rule for engineering firms to pay the building trade district rates for this, kind of work, which is not comparable with the building trade proper, and they held that when certain special advantages which their employees enjoy are taken into account, the rates now paid are fair.The Court held that it had not been shown that the practice of engineering&quot; establishments in the London district is to pay building trade rates to builders&apos; tradesmen and labourers engaged on maintenance work, and, having regard to the special circumstances -attendant upon the men&apos;s employment, the Court found that the claim had not been established.      -
STATISTICAL   APPENDIX.Employment Exchanges.The Unemployment Position. On the 26th August, in the United Kingdom 1,603,370 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and out-of-work donation policies, remained &quot;lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,276,246 were lodged by males and 327,124 by females.
