Is increasing and demonstrations hare occurred in many provincial towns.*Somewhat serious rioting occurred last night at Bristol, and looting at Dundee, where there had been disturbance on the previotis day;   in each oase the police were forced to make baton charges.   Disturbances also occurred yesterday in Sunderland and Liverpool.The National Administrative Counoil of Unemployed Organisations, with headquarters at the International Socialist Club, Is working feverishly to organise the unemployed;   members of the London District Council are aotive in all parts of the Metropolis.,There have been numerous demonstrations in connection with the arrest ot the Poplar Councillors;   meetings are hold each night outside Brlxton Gaol and a demonstration has been planned for Trafalgar Square on Saturday next.The Communist Party had raised, by September 1st, only  2530 for tho Famine Eund.The &quot;Workers1 Dreadnought&quot; expects to close down shortly.Complete reports of the Trade Union Congress have notyet/^     3330 RETReport Np.l3S
yet been received, &quot;but will be stanmarisod in my next repor&quot;^The Sinn Feiners are serioixsly alarmecl at the-independent attitude of labour in Cork and. elsewhere.   They tfear that the Soviet movement may spread.   While a great effort is to be made to force the Government into the position of coercing Ulster it is still doubtful whether the extremists are ready&apos;to faca a resumption of hostilities.
THE -TJBKMgliOYBD .-The demeanour of the unemployed la dealt with in a Special Report attached hereto.POPLAR.  The Poplar councillors who were indicted for contempt of Court aye, with one exception, now in prison and, although they derived unusual advertisement from their delayed arrests they do not appear to find prison life as easy as they had anticipated.     Numerous meetings have been held during the week at ^&quot;j&apos;hich monotonous explanations of their positions were given,.     On September 2nd. however, Councillor Charles Key stated in Poplar Toxvn Hall that the Councillors still at liberty had decided&apos; to levy only the rates necessary for the essential work inside the&apos; Borough and refused to levy rates for outside authorities until the demand for equalisation had been granted.   They must, however, remember that if they put the no-rent strike into operation at once it would mean that no rates would be paid and that the Council %&quot;ou!d be unable to carry on the work of the Borough.     The Councillors hoped that they would be In a stronger financial position next month and     they   had therefore decided not to put the no-rent strike into operation unless the Government attempted to collect the rates over the&apos; heads of the Council.     In the meantime the Ward Committees of the Labour Party would form the , nucleus of an organisation that would go from house to -house and explain the&apos;situation to the householders.On the same day a crowd of-aibout 500 escorted Lansbury to his home and upon their return to Poplar the Police had some trouble in dispersing, them with the result that five men ^ere arrested;   four were subsequently fined 20/- for insulting behaviour,.two in addition  3 each for obstructing and assaulting the police and the fifth was dismissed under the   Probation of Offenders Act .The/
g     mThe Poplar Trade a Council and the Bow and Bromley and South Poplar labour Party Joint Publicity Committee which ha^ apparently   .ensured the advertisement of the Councillors, baa issued on appeal for subscriptions for the maintenance of the councillors1 families which has been sent to every member of the Trades Union Council, overy trade union, co-operative society and local labour and Trades Council in the country.Meetings are held outside Brixton Gaol every night, at which the Red,Flag,is sung to cheer the imprisoned Councillors;    yesterday there was a. march to Holloway, preceded.by meetings at Poplar Town Hall and at the Obelisk, Bcw;   arrangements are being made to hold a demonstration in Trafalgar Square on September 10th.On September 6th a tenants League was formed atPoplar with the following, aims:-&quot;To support all movements having for their object the national&quot; right to work or full maintenance for the unemployed;    and: the equalisation of. rates.&quot;To give advice and legal assistance to members on all matters relative to their rent and rates.&quot;To give advice and assistance on compensation and other matters affecting-tLfc-Interests of members and their families where vsracLe union rules do not apply.&quot;It was resolved to establish the League on a permanent basis;   officers are to be appointed by members at massmeetings.THE COMMUNISTS&apos;......... ,The following extracts taken from a report compiled byWhitehead, &quot;Famine Department Manager&quot; for the CommunistParty of Great Britain, and dated September lst8 throwintoresting light upon the communist activities in connectionwith the famine in Russia:&quot;Our Famine Weak was a week of very intense party activity and&apos; -bo.&apos;*date the&apos;party has raised  550cCO. for the l^&amp;iaine Funds and there is every indication of- considerable/
-   -  -considerable sums in addition still to come In,..&quot;On receiving the call from the Third International relative to the Famine position in Soviet Russia, the Communist Party, B.endeavoured, to get a united conference of all working olass political and industrial organisations to set on foot a united Labour Effort for&apos; Famine Relief,     Other counsels than those of the Party, however, prevailed, and the Labour Party took other steps as detailed further on In the report.&quot;Secondly the Executive decided as a preliminary step to devote the week August 21st - 28th as a special RUSSIAN fami3je3 WBE2..,In organising this Famine Week, the Party printed a quarter of a million Famine Leaflets (three varieties) and a thousand special Famine Posters.     The Branches and Divisions arranged&quot;as many open air propaganda meetings as possible, amounting to over a thousand meetings all over the country, 467 cf these being In London alone,   The Party also devoted a special number of the Communist almost exclusively to Famine Propaganda with special articles and cartoons.     Further weekly notes for propaganda&apos; specially dealing with the Famine question were prepared and issued and*are being continued.. .A special Famine Pin was prepared, which is being, sold at 3d., 40,000 of those hate been dealt with to commence with;   Local branches are arranging Draws, Concerts; Dances, and looal activities as convenient.     Subscription sheets have been prepared for use In Trade Union Branches and other Labour bodies...Famine activity outside the Party^&quot;The Imperial War Relief Fund, which was latterly occupied with providing relief for War sufferers in Central Europe has taken up the Famine Question.     The heads of the Labour Party have lent their names and support to this organisation, which operates as regards the Russian.Famine through the Joint Red Cross at Geneva.   The Executive of the Russian Famine Department of the liixperial War Relief Fund is dominated by a good working majority Of liberal bourgeois elements, who in the words of Lansbury, can guarantee that ho conditions are imposed unpalatable to Soviet Russia&quot;.   Wedgewood Is chairman of this &apos; executive, Brailsford, vice-chairman, and Lansbury, Ruth Fry, Hagberg Wright, and other liberals are on it. &quot;Prominent capitalist politicians such as Lord Chancellor, Asquith, Curzon, have lent their names for advertising the Fund, but are not on the Executive Committee.&quot;The Save the Children Fund, controlled by the Quakers Is also operating through the Red Cross at Geneva.&quot;The I.L.P., S.D.F., have both started separate Famine Funds but these parties are undertaking very little Famine Propaganda or&apos; publicity.&quot;I saw Lansbury on Wednesday, and while there he rang up the Labour Party, who informed him that while agreeing&apos; with&apos;the Berlin Conference, lack of time to get passports, etc., would prevent them from being actually there.&quot;Further I had an interview with the Secretary of the Imperial War Relief Committee.     He stressed the point that they were absolutely non-political, and after some discussion he made the offer that to secure unity of effort he would guarantee that if we would pay In our fund to him, he would hand it on by cheque to Munzenberg in Berlin atonoe/
once, all our monies to be so earmarked.   He also promised to consider the question of also working through Berlin, and , expressed the hope that Berlin snd Geneva would come to an  t amicable arrangement so as to Fight the Famine from a 1 unity;&quot;of- command&apos; (as with the Allies in the War).     That is the position at the moment.   Deoisions taken at Berlin and developments in the next few days will without doubt clarify the position.     Meanwhile the Communist Party is making the keynote of its propaganda - RELIEF FOR SOVIET RUSSIA FREE FROM ALL CONDITIONS.&quot;Individual donations, so far acknowledged in the &quot;Communist&quot;, amount to  69.1,0.     The Hull communists collected  4.1.3-1- but only sent In  3, the balance having been swallowed up by expenses, Whitehead agreed under protest to print an acknowledgment for the first sum.&quot;Red Week&quot; is now In progress &quot;but there is, as yet, no indication as to its success.The largest meeting reported this week was held at Manchester on September 4th, when 2^000 people were present.   The speakers were Dlxon and Towns, who delivered stereotyped, addresses which call for no comment.On August 30th, Arthur MoIvlanus and R.C, Wallhead,: chairman of the Independent Labour Party, debated &quot;Which is the better policy for the working class - that of the Communist Party or the Independent Labour Party?&quot;      About 2,300 people attended, mostly Clyde workers and communists.   MoManus.took the line that subtle industrial propaganda was preferable to constitutional methods as a means of affecting the dictatorship of the proletariat and that a strong revolutionary minority, imposing a &quot;rigid&quot; dictatorship, could lead the masses and stabilise their power onoe the revolution had been started by the stress of economist conditions:   communists would work to that end by means of every Industrial dispute.   Wallhead argued that it was necessary to capture, political power arid that until the electorate was sooialistically educated and a Labour Government returned, a revolution of force would he frustrated by the Army, Navy and Police.   No questions were allowed and no vote was taken
* 657- 5 -but communists consider the debate to have been successful &quot;financially and otherwise.&quot;Pol levying upon their expulsion from the looal Labour Party, the communist members of the Edmonton district council, who became notorious on Empire Day, have resigned.Tom Bell has returned from a lengthy visit to Russia and the Continent and Tom Clark expeots to return to Glasgow shortly,William Paul is now editing the &quot;Communist Review&quot;; 10,000 copies of the August number, which contains 96 pages were printed;   the paper is sold for 6d., a sum whioh does not represent the oost of production.   The August number was submitted to tho Direotor of Public Prosecutions who considered!, however, that under the existing legislation he had no power to prosecute:   communists are fully alive to the expiration of the Defence of the Realm Regulations and think that the authorities will have no power&apos;to Interfere with their meetings even   if the speeches be seditious.According to a statement made by Norah Snyth on September 2nd, the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; is about to cease publication owing to financial difficulties.Ths first public demonstration-in England of the Young Communist League was held in Trafalgar Square on Septen&amp;ber 4th.     The Young Communist International ha3 ordered a Special propaganda week in all countries from September 4th -September 10th but there has been little response in this country.THE SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTYThe finances of this Party are practically nil and\ a special meeting of the Scottish members of the National,,.Executive/
Executive Committee 1s to bo hold to consider the situation. Efforts are being made to levy all members in order to wipe off the party1e liabilities.LABOUR, AND A GMERAL SLEPTION    .ThQ Labour Party is of opinion that a general election is imminent and organisation conferences wore held at Dundoo and Birmingham on September 3rd.     About 1.000 delegates wore present in Dundee and a subsequent meeting of   4,000 people was addressed by Ramsay McDonald, R.C. Wallhead, E.D. Morel and others.     At Birmingham, Mr. Arthur Henderson spoke on unemployment and Ireland and claimed that the Labour Party had played a big part In bringing about the present truce,NATIONAL LABOUR HOUSING.ASS00IATI0NThe annual conference of this body was held at Cardiff on September 3rd, when, in response to 1,800 invitations, 184 delegates, representing 106 societies, were present.   The chair was taken by E.L. Poulton, J.P., and other speakers were Councillor Jenkins 6f Noath, G. Hicks and Gilchrist, of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives and D. Roes, of the National Union of Agricultural Workers.   Five resolutions dealing with housing problems were passed and it was decided that a deputation should present these to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Health.ARRESTSOn September 1st &quot;Sendy&quot; Ross, the Glasgow communist, was arrested for a seditious speech, made on August 2nd, the day of hie release after serving a sentence of three months1 Imprisonment.   Ross said:%&quot;I have got into trouble before forsaying this, and I don1t give a d-- if I get intotrouble again.     I am going to repeat it now, and ; that is - If you workers are hungry and oannot get foodif lt*s there, you can b------well take It and be d-----to them.   The Prince of Wales is going to India, and is t*,    get/
get  25,000 to pay his expenses. Wall, all I ean say is - Curse him. If he wants to go to India, let him go as a stowaway.&quot;Ball was refused.&quot;THE DAILY HERALD,fOn September 6th it was announced at a meeting of tho first debenture holders in the &quot;Dally Herald&quot; Limited, that the prioe of the paper will be reduced to one penny as soon as possible.   Debenture holders approved a plan for raising  100,000 by the issue of small debentures and it was agreed that the unit of investment should  be reauoed from  100 to  5*    Messrs. Arthur Henderson and J.H. Thomas were re-appointed trustees for the debenture holders and John Twomey was appointed third trustee in the place of Robinson who resigned on bis election to a directorship.It is reported that the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; was recently distributed gratis at Sheerness in barracks and ships by newsboys.&quot;THE   WORKER&quot;The open contempt of Parliament, whloh this year has been a feature of labour speeches, Is becoming increasingly marked in extremist papers.   The followingextracts taken from the current issue of the &quot;Worker&quot;indicate the extent to which the license hitherto allowed in. this respect Is being abused:&quot;The British House of commons I   Poor old Guy Jfawkesl   God forgive him.

There is no limit to/the nauseating cant of these arch-hypocrites, these sorry&quot;tricksters, who sit in that house of sham and shame up there In the Metropolis!&quot;*.....   iSIHN FJSIN IN GREAT Britain there has been comparatively little activity in Sinn Fein circles during the week:    the leaders are puzzled as to the next move and admit that many of their supporters are young and irx-esponsible. -Arms are in great demand in Ireland and it Is thought that Sinn feiners may be responsible for the theft, of 19 rifles from the store room at Assaye Barracks during the night of August 28tlij On September 2nd a case of pistols was landed at Tilbury docks and put in a shed;    it was found on the next day that 16 pistols of different make were missing.The &quot;Catholic Herald&quot; has published an article strongly advising acceptance of the peace terms which was possibly inspired by the peaco party, with a view to,obtaining the support of the Irish in England as a check to the extremists in - Ireland..- -   ,-.       - - . 1       --   On,August 27th a congress of Irish Societies.was held In Liverpool at which James Moran, president of the United Irish Societies in Liverpool, suggested that the advent of an Irish settlement would make feasible the organisation of Councils, sue as-existed In,Liverpool, in every big centre of:Irish people in Great Britain,   . The proposal was weloomed by the Rev. F.: Q&apos;P&apos;. Gerrardwho said that&apos;, although Liverpool had &quot;done well, too many Irish were, as yet, untouched;   those must 1)&apos; roped/
roped In and &quot;Irelandlsed&quot;.The recently released Glasgow prisoners were warmly welcomed on their return from Edinburgh?, their defence cost  6^000 :nd efforts are being made to collect the whole of this sum in GlasgowOn September 10th the Scottish Sinn Fein Executive will meet at tho Connolly Club and will be attended for the last time by Jack O^Sheehan, who is returning to Ireland;   his successor will probably be announced at the meeting.Moderate opinion is said: to be making headway in the Glasgow area and this fact is causing alarm among the extremists who are standing out for a Republic&apos; or a renewal of hostilities.1.ATT)There is very little fresh information about Ireland to reoord this week.     The situation remains much the eano, but the tension is greater and two uncertain factors might easily preoipitato the crleis.Irish labour, as represented by the Irish Transport Y/ori-ers&apos; Union, is 5:ettinf very restless owing to the .. reduction in.wages, and Sinn Fein has had to ask the loaders to tide things ovor until the peace question is settled.The employees of the Cork Harbour Commissioners&apos;, who are members of tho Irish Transport Workers&apos; Union, went on strike on September 6th, took over the Board and hoisted tho &quot;Soviet&quot; rod flag.   The Board is practically Slim Fein anfl their action as such was a threat to the Sinn IPein Government.   The dispute arose over e refusal on the part of tho men to acceT)t a minimum wage of  3,10.0 per week.    A. o oof or once was held and arfongfit those present was a representstive of the Dail Sire&amp;un Fiuistry of labour.The farmers in the 3ov,tb are being asked to meet &amp; demand for increases wages, whioh es they have been forced repeatedly to pay contributions to local bands of the Irish Republican Army, placeo ^ew in a deplorable position.The/
The other factor is tho uncertainty that exists as to the intentions of the extremist-loaders,   These Irish Re pub 11 oan Brotherhood and Irish Republican Army hot-heads, might any moment take action on. their own and throw over&apos; tho leaders who are now negotiating for. the Dail Eireanna     The feeling in Kerry, Cork, Clara, and Longford .is all. for.no surrenders and loss talk, and there is a general ^mistrust1..   What may hold back the extremist leaders Is the fact that the opinion of tho World, and America in particular,.. is known- to &quot;be &apos;&quot;favourable to an aooeptanco of tho offer made by the British -Government.. and that, if they break out thoy may loso all sympathy from America, and what is more serious funds from that source may be cut off.If a plebiscite is called the result is sure to be in accordance with the wishes and directions of extremists as long as these are in tho strong position thoy now occupy, and if the young men of the Irish Republican Army are   called upon to take the field, in spite of the reluctance of a fairly largo number to undergo tho risks again, it seems probable that tho order will be fully obeyed.     The consequences of not obeying   are woll knowneThe odds aro still slightly in favour of the moderate party being able to induce an acceptance of tho proposals, birfe. the atmosphere is highly charged with electricity.     The   . appearance of five aeroplanes over some Irish Republican Army camps the other day resulted in a dash for cover, and the apprehension that the attack had coma.     This attack&quot;of nerves was displeasing to some of the older members.
