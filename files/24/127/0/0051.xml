They have no statutory power to do so.   The Commiit-e are of opinion that, the machinery of the Poor Law Guardians is available and, so far,  adequate to meet the crisis;    and although the situation wants very careful watching there appears no reason to apprehend that the Poor Law Guardians wil not be able by the usual machinery of loans which is at their disposal to meet the situation in the next few weeks.- 1 -
It has been represented to the Committee that so serious a situation may develop in respect of some of the Poor Law Unions as to constitute a serious emergency*The Committee accordingly recommend that, in the event of an emergency arising, the Ministry of Health in consultation with the Treasury and Ministry of Labour be authorised to take such measures as may be necessary to enable the Poor Law Guardians concerned to secure loans.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, 19th August,  1921.
