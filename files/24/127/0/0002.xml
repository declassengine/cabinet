Attention may be drawn, however, to the decision of the National Sailors and Fire-men^ Union to withdraw from the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, and to the movement on foot in South Wales and Monmouthshire to place colliery crafts-men once more outside the sphere of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation. In London, amongst shop-assistants, and in Lancashire, amongst road transport workers, the position of the workers is being adversely affected by the competing interests of unions. In the first case, the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks and the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers are concerned; and in the second case, the United Vehicle Workers and the United Road Transport Workers&apos; Association. These facts are sympto-matic, and would appear to point to the conclusion that the stress of the present time is tending slightly towards disintegration of the trade union movement, or, at least, is putting a stop to the consolidation movement which has been so pronounced in the past two years.The August Bank Holiday week-end has been the occasion of the annual meet-ings of a few trade unions. The most important trade union conference in the near future is the postponed annual meeting, on the 17th August, of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, in preparation for which the National Union of Scottish Mine-workers are to hold their conference on the 12th August.The position with regard to disputes in progress or threatened continues to be remarkably quiet, while the decrease in the number of unemployed, as shown by the live register totals, continues. The estimated total of the live register of all Employ-f\ ment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 29th of Julv was 1,788,500, being approximately the same as that of the 22nd April at the end 01 the third week of the recent coal dispute.The President of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, Mr. James Winstone, died on the 27th July. Mr. Winstone was one of the representatives of the Federa-tion on the Executive Committee of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.(34295-31) Wt.7J-b 5 300 8/21 H.St. Qp. 99/3
features  of the  week.General Topics.Compulsory A rbitration in Industrial Disputes. The possibilities of bringing into operation some plan for the settlement of industrial disputes have been con-sidered by the Executive Committee of the Imperial Commercial Association. A scheme has been drawn up and forwarded to the Prime Minister and to members of both Houses of Parliament. The scheme is based upon the principle of compulsory arbitration and conciliation, and under it all strikes and lock-outs would be illegal until three definite statutory processes had been tried without success.Some general features of the scheme are that it relies upon judicial, rather than administrative,, machinery; the intervention of a government department will only take place in the last rebort. Secondly, it incorporates the views of trade union activities which prompted the Trade&apos; Union Ballot Bill. The machinery proposed to be established is obviously expensive; but there is no reference to the question of costs, though, in the application of legal ideas to industrial relations, this question must inevitably be a stumbling-block.The details of the scheme are as follows: In the first place, a Conciliation Commissioner should be appointed for a fixed term, and it should be compulsory for all employers and employed to put before him a statement of any matters which they wish to raise. The Conciliation Commissioner would call upon the responding party to put forward, within seven days, a statement in reply. He would then summon both parties to a conference, over which he would preside, and which wTould be attended by an equal number of representatives of both sides. If an agreement were arrived at by this means, the Conciliation Board would seal and register it as an award for a given time.If an agreement were not reached, both parties would be required to furnish, within forty-eight hours, to the commissioner statements showing the grounds upon which they differ, and all the statements, showing the nature of the dispute and the reasons for the failure to reach an agreement, would be published daily, for ten days, in the public Press. At the end of ten days the dispute would automatically come before a specially constituted Arbitration Court, consisting of a permanent presi-dent, who should be a High Court judge, and four assessors, two of whom should be nominated by each of the contending parties. This court would have power to enforce its decisions, in the case of employers, by fines or by cancellation of the registration of the employers&apos; association; and, in the case of trades unions, by fines inflicted upon the funds of the union, or by cancellation of the registration of the union. It would also have power to deal with individuals who act contrary to the law without the authority of the body to which they belong.Should either party to the dispute be dissatisfied with the award laid down by the Arbitration Court, such party would have power to refer the award to its mem-bers for acceptance or rejection, and the members would vote upon the question under a secret ballot to be conducted by officials of the State. Should the award be rejected, a strike or lock-out would become legal and then, but not before, the direct intervention of the Government could be invoked.The Cost of Living. The special committee of inquiry, representative of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party and the co-operative movement, together with some of the greater trade union bodies,* has now issued the final report of their investigations into the cost of living. The com-mittee point out that the report should be considered in conjunction with their interim reports on the financial and monetary aspects of the case,t and the relation between taxation and the cost of living. \Part I of the report deals with the estimation of the increase in the cost of living since the, war. The methods for determining the Ministry of Labour index number are. investigated in detail, and it is concluded&quot; that the figure is defective for the following main reasons : It &quot; weights &quot; rent and rates too heavily, it under-estimates the relative importance of clothing, and it attaches too little importance* See this Report, New Series, No. 22, 20th June, 1920, p. 759. t See this Report, Vol. II, No. 12,18th September, p 359. X See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 7,- 12th February, p. 152.
6a6.8.21* These criticisms of the Labour Gazette cost-of-living statistics are now being examined by the department.t This conference arrived at various decisions with regard to agricultural policy, which have not yet been made public. A special Committee was appointed to co-ordinate the decisions and to-prepare a draft policy, which is to be considered at a further conference, to be held at an early date.34295to the group of &quot; other items.&quot; The committee estimate that the cost of living in September, 1920, was 189 per cent, above the level of July, 1914, and this estimate is contrasted with the corresponding Labour Gazette index number of 161.*Part II of the Report is an examination of the causes of the high cost of living. Profiteering, combinations and monopolies, inefficiency in industry, and restriction of output, are considered in all their bearings upon the question, and, from the conclu-sions made in this part of the report, certain constructive proposals are put forward in Part III. Stress is laid upon the necessary subordination of industry and com-merce to the common weal, which should be brought about by (a) public ownership  national and local, (b) voluntary co-operation, (c) public regulation of the economic system.Corn Production A cts (Repeal) Bill. The opposition to the decision to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board still continues and demonstrations of agricultural workers throughout the country have been held to protest against the Governments action. Meetings organised by the, National Union of Agricultural Workers were held on the 31st July, at Milverton, in Somersetshire, and at Colchester, where resolutions protesting against the abolition of the Board were carried. A series of meetings, under the auspices of the Workers&apos; Union, with the support of the Kirkham, Poulton and Lancaster Trades Councils, have been conducted in the North-Western area, and the Workers&apos; Union also organised, on the 26th July, a demonstration at Faringdon, in Berkshire, which was attended by 2,000 agricultural workers, at which a resolution was adopted calling upon the Government to provide machinery to secure for the agricultural worker a living wage. Similar demonstrations were held on the same day, at King&apos;s Lynn, Rugby, and North Walsham, in Norfolk, where the chief speakers were, respectively, Mr. R. B. Walker, secretary of the National Union of Agricultural Workers, Mr. W. R. Smith, M.P., and Mr. George Edwards, M.P.A conference was held at the Central Hall, Westminster, on the 28th and 29th July, of representatives of the unions catering for agricultural workers, Labour members of Parliament and candidates for agricultural constituencies, with delegates from the Land Nationalisation Society and the Society for the Taxation of Land Values. The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress was also represented. The question of a policy for agriculture was discussedt and it was decided, inter alia, to press for the continuance of Wages Boards and Agricultural Councils in the various districts.Industrial and Other Organisations.National Federation of Building Trades Employers of Great Britain and Ireland. The half-yearly meeting of the National Federation of Building Trades Employers of Great Britain and Ireland was held in Sheffield on the 26th July and following days. At a private conference a letter from the Ministry of Labour was read desiring the fulfilment of the pledges of the Federation to give employment to ex-Service men. After discussion, the Federation unanimously passed a resolution expressing regret that circumstances had prevented the success of the scheme for the employment of ex-Service men and a determination to put the scheme into working order at once.Another resolution wras also passed protesting against the action of carpenters in refusing to fix imported doors, and pledging support to builders in upholding their right to buy materials without interference from the operatives.Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations, Ltd.-At a special meeting of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations, Ltd., held in Manchester on the 26th July, Mr. Fred Holroyd, of Messrs. R. &amp; J. Holroyd, Ltd., Halifax, was elected president and Mr. Wm. Howarth, of Bolton, at one time secretary of the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners and Twiners, vice-president in Mr. Holroyd&apos;s place.A meeting of the executive committee was held on the 29th July to receive the results of the ballot of members in the American section on the continuance of
short time. It was announced that, as the necessary 80 per cent, of employers had not been found in favour of continuance of short time, the members were at liberty to work their machinery the full hours if they wished. The members of the Egyptian section discontinued organised short time about a fortnight ago.Industrial League and Council, The president, Yiscount Burnham, and the Rt. Hon. G. H. Roberts, M.P., and a special committee of the Industrial League and Council are issuing a public appeal for funds to carry on their work. In order to make the league of real national value it is stated that branches must be set up throughout the Kingdom, and its educational and propaganda work systematically organised. A great measure of success is claimed for the branches already estab-lished in the larger industrial centres.Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress. The annual meeting of the Irish Trades Union Congress opened in Dublin on the 2nd August. Mr. Foran, the president, said that the Labour Party hoped that peace negotiations would mean peace and freedom for Ireland and that, whatever occurred, the negotiators would have the co-operation of Labour. The meeting was visited by Mr. De Valera, who spoke of the value to his cause of the support of Labour.Some discussion took place on the railway position, as regards both the Irish Railways Bill and the alleged failure of the Great Northern Railway of Ireland to reinstate some 15 of the men concerned in the munitions of war strike last year.It was suggested that a general strike might be declared against proposed reduction of wages to accord with the decreased cost of living.trade union topics.National Transport Workers&apos; Federation. The National Sailors and Firemen&apos;s Union has given the necessary three months&apos; notice of secession from the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation. This decision was arrived at at a recent meeting of the Executive Council of the union, and was not unexpected. Relations between the two bodies have been strained for some time as the sailors and firemen&apos;s union are extremely hostile to the &quot; direct action &quot; policy underlying the Triple Alliance. The ostensible reason for their withdrawal is, however, the passing of a resolution at the annual conference of the Federation last June, which called for the provision of adequate machinery to give effect to decisions of the Triple Alliance, and recom-mended that, on a decision of any section, the Alliance should become a consultative body with full executive powers. The seamen were afraid that this decision might commit them to strike action without the power to take a preliminary ballot.The matter will be discussed further at the annual conference of the union in September.South Wales Miners&apos; Federation. A movement is reported among South Wales underground craftsmen, enginemen and surface workers, to break away from this Federation.It will be remembered that, until January, 1921, there existed the Monmouth-shire and South Wales Colliery Enginemen and Craftsmen&apos;s Association, which, however, a few months ago merged their identity in that of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation. It is now proposed to resuscitate the old organisation under a new title &quot; The Enginemen, Stokers, Surfacemen and Craftsmen&apos;s Association &quot; and to extend the right of membership to surface workers generally.The movement would appear to be due mainly to the existence of considerable dissatisfaction with the attitude of the federation towards their craftsmen members during the recent strike. There is also a great deal of opposition to the revolutionary policy of the South Wales miners Federation, especially as evinced by their recent decision to recommend the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain to affiliate to the Third International.Trade Union A malgamation.-A preliminary ballot has been taken on the pro-posed amalgamation of the United Society of Boiler Makers and Iron and Steel Shipbuilders, and the Associated Blacksmiths and Ironworkers&apos; Society. Both associations obtained a majority in favour of empowering their executives to pro-ceed with the drafting of an amalgamation scheme : this scheme, when prepared, will be submitted to members before being put into operation.
These negotiations are the result of the breakdown of the scheme for amalga-mating the blacksmiths&apos; and boiler-makers&apos; associations with the Ship-constructors&apos; and Shipwrights&apos; Association.^National Amalgamated Labourers&apos; Union.-The annual conference of the national Amalgamated Labourers&apos; Union was held in Cardiff on the 2nd and 3rd August, under the presidency of Mr. T. J. Wilson, who, in his opening address, referred to the fact that their organisation would cease shortly to exist as a separate union. In October, the National Amalgamated Labourers&apos; Union will be merged in the new &quot; Transport and General Workers&apos; Union.&quot;! He described the past year as the most disastrous in the trade union movement, culminating in the failure of the transport workers and railwaymen to strike with the miners on the 15th April. He concluded with an appeal for unity in the face of further attacks. The rest of the proceedings were held in private.Scottish Union of Dock Labourers. The annual conference of the Scottish Union of Dock Labourers opened in Greenock on the 1st August. In his presidential address, Mr. David Marshall, of Glasgow, dwelt upon the problem of unemployment. He advocated the reorganisation and consolidation of the trade union movement; his opinion was that the immediate future would prove a testing time.negotiations and disputes.demands and negotiations.Freestone Quarrying Workers (Yorkshire). At the annual meeting of the Yorkshire Area Joint Council for the Freestone Section of the quarrying industry, which was held at Brighouse on the 25th July, it was agreed that the local agree-menU should stand for six months from the 25th July, and that either side should give two months&apos; notice of withdrawal.Some discussion took place, as to the operation of the sliding scale. This scale operates from an index number of 170, and for every 6^ points fall there is to be \d. per hour reduction. The first revision was due on the 29th June, when the cost-of-living index number showed a fall of 51 points from the basis line. Taking into account the reduction of 3d. per hour which was effected on the 16th June, the em-ployers contended that there should now be a further reduction of Id., but the operatives claimed that the reduction should only amount to \d. The meeting was adjourned until the 2nd August, in order that the employers might consult their Federation in the matter. This disagreement, i.e., as to whether the nearest interval, or the nearest interval above or below, should count, is typical of the differences which occur in connexion with the interpretation of sliding-scale arrangements.At this annual meeting the operative masons&apos; union claimed better representa-tion on the council, and threatened to withdraw if this was not granted. No agree-ment was, however, arrived at on this question.Shipbuilders (National). It will be remembered that, as a result of the con-ference of representatives of the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the trade unions covering riveters, slaters, shipwrights, blacksmiths, &amp;c, held at Montagu House on the 8th July, it was agreed that the claim of the employers for the with-drawal of the &quot; standard ship &quot; cycle of advances should be referred to a special board of arbitration appointed under the provisions of Section 2 (2) (c) of the Industrial Courts Act, 1919.5This board has now been set up, with Sir William McKenzie, K.B.E., K.C., as chairman. The other members are Mr. James Fullerton, C.B.E., nominated by the employers, and Councillor G. J. Rowe, nominated by the workpeople.Arrangements have been made for the hearing of the Scottish case at Glasgow on the 9th August.Furniture Warehousing and Remowing Industry (National). A meeting of the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee for this industry was held in London -on the 27th July, when the labour side of the committee reported that the employers&apos; proposal to increase the working week from 48 to 54 hoursll had been put before the* See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 4, 23rd July, p. 47, and also, Vol. Ill, No. 24, 11th June, p. 479.i For an account of this new organisation, see this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 21, 21st May, p. 434.i See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 1, 2nd July, p. 8.\ See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 3, 16th July, p. 40.i See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 26, 25th June, p. 520.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.men, but they had refused to accept. After considerable discussion it was recom-mended that an alternative scheme should be drawn up, to provide for a basic wage and a sliding scale based on the cost-of-living index number. It was agreed that this recommendation should be placed before, the unions and the employers&apos; associa-tion represented on the Committee and, if found to be acceptable, that a sub-committee should be appointed to produce a workable scheme.Leather Belting Workers (National). At a meeting between representatives of the Federation of Leather Belting Manufacturers of the United Kingdom and the National Leather Trades Federation, held recently in Leeds, the employers gave three months&apos; notice, under the existing agreement, of their intention to reduce wages. The proposal is that after the 12th October the 12^ per cent, and 7  per cent, bonuses shall be discontinued. The proposal is being considered by the unions con-cerned, and a further joint meeting is to be held in Leeds in the near future.settlements and agreements.Crucible Steel Workers (Sheffield). An agreement, to come into operation on the 2nd August, has been reached between the Crucible Steel Makers&apos; Association and the Sheffield and District Engineering Trades Employers&apos; Association on the one hand, and the, Iron and Steel Trades Confederation on the other.With regard to conditions of work, it has been agreed to revert to the &quot; three-round &quot; system,^ where desired.   This arrangement is conditioned by three provisos :(1) It is recommended that a workman shall spend only half his time on the &quot; three-round &quot; system, and the other half on two rounds per day ;(2) The employers have guaranteed that the working day shall not exceed 11 hours ; (3) Either side may reopen the question after three months.Wages of shift workers will be reduced by Is. 2d. per shift off the present con-solidated war bonus, and those of men working a 47-hour week by 65. per week, plus 12J per cent.   The &quot; stint &quot; is to remain as at present at 14 cwts.Cutlery Workers (Sheffield). An agreement has been reached between the Sheffield Cutlery Manufacturers&apos; Association, on the one hand, and the National Amalgamated Union of Labour and the Cutlery Union (Sheffield), on the other, to reduce wages, as from the 25th July, by 5s. Qd. per week for datal men of 21 years of age and over, and 5s. per week for youths of 18 to 21. Piece-workers are to be subject to a reduction of 15 per cent, on war bonus. With regard to women workers, a reduction is to be made of 3s. per week for those of 18 years of age and over, and 2s. a week for those under 18.Spring Trade Operatives (Sheffield). An agreement, to come into operation on the 1st August, has been reached in the coil spring section of the industry between the Workers&apos; Union and the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, on the one hand,, and the employers on the other, whereby wages are to be reduced by 8s. per week, in the case of piece-workers and engineers, and by 6s. per week plus 12^ per cent., in the case of datal workers.Bobbin and Shuttle Making Industry (National)-A meeting of the Joint Industrial Council was held on the 26th July, when the following reductions in wages were agreed upon, to take effect from the 1st August: 3s. per week for skilled and semi-skilled men; 5s. per week for labourers, 4s. per week for women, and 10 per cent, for juveniles. A further meeting of the Council will be held early in September to discuss proposals by the employers for further reductions.Tailoring Trade (Manchester.) Negotiations between the Manchester branch of the National Federation of Merchant Tailors and the Amalgamated Society of Tailors and Tailoresses have resulted in a settlement whereby the agreement of the 10th May, 1920, has been cancelled, and reduced rates substituted. By the new terms a minimum of Is. Id. and Is. per log hour on the London log will be paid to male log workers in first-class and second-class shops, respectively, in lieu of the previous rates of Is. 3d. and Is. 2d. Rates of male piece-workers are to be reduced by 12  -per cent, and the rates for female log workers are fixed at 10^d. per log hour, with a reduction of 10 per cent, on piece-workers&apos; rates. The new time rates vary from  4 2s. to  3 16s. for male workers, and from  2 10s. to  117s. for female workers.The agreement will come into operation on the 1st August and will remain in force until lower rates are fixed by the Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board or a new arrangement is come to by the Conciliation Board for the East Lancashire Area.* i.e., the crucibles will be changed and teemed three times per day.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.Bakers (North Staffordshire). An agreement has been reached between the North Staffordshire Master Bakers&apos; Association and the Amalgamated Union of Operative Bakers, Confectioners and Allied Workers, whereby wages have been reduced by 5s. per week, as from the first pay-day in July, with a further reduction of 5s. per week, to take place on the first pay-day in August. Thereafter there is to operate a sliding scale variation of 2s. Qd. per week for every 10 points rise or fall in the cost-of-living index number above or below 120 points.The minimum weekly wage for males over 21 years of age will be  3 lbs. per week, as from the 1st August, and the agreement stipulates that when that figure shall have been reduced to  2 2s. Qd. per week, there shall be no further reductions on account of any further decreases in the cost of living.Co-operative Employees (Scotland). With reference to the negotiations between the Scottish Co-operative Wages Board and the National Union of Dis-tributive and Allied Workers on the question of the modification of Sheriff Fyfe&apos;s Award,* about 900 employees of 11 societies in the eastern counties ceased work on the 25th July. The societies concerned, without waiting for the result of negotia-tions, notified the union on the 15th July that it was intended to reduce wages to the 1920 basis, as from the 23rd of that month. The union endeavoured to secure a withdrawal of the notice, but, as no reply was received from the societies, the position was regarded as being a lock-out. At the outset the union endeavoured to negotiate with the East of Scotland Wages Board, but dissension amongst the members of the Board rendered negotiations impossible, and accordingly the union were obliged to negotiate with the individual co-operative societies involved. As a result, it has been possible to enforce the demand that the provision of Sheriff Fyfe&apos;s Award shall be maintained, and work was accordingly resumed by all the societies on the 26th and 27th July.Co-operative Insurance Society Employees (National). The strike of district managers, agents and office clerks employed by the Co-operative Insurance Society which began on the 14th July,t owing to the alleged victimisation of a trade union official, has now been settled. The District Managers&apos; Fraternal Association and the district manager directly concerned expressed regret for their action, and the society agreed to reinstate the manager with the result that work has been resumed.The settlement was made on the 28th July, following upon discussions between the general manager of the society and representatives of the National Union of Dis-tributive and Allied Workers and the National Amalgamated Union of Life . Assurance Workers.n* See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 3, 16th July, p. 41. t See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 4, 23rd July. p. 50.
