Before we separate it is my duty to invite theCP.3216. attention of my oolleaguos to the unemployment position.If we look baok upon the Industrial events of the last nine or ten months, with the heavy trade depression that set in last autumn and the prolonged struggle with the miners, culminating in the unprecedented unemployment figures of June, the almost complete absenoo of oivll disorder is rom&amp;rkable.   During June the Smployment Changes were paying Benefit to over three millions of wholly or partially unemployed workers and in addition over a million miners, ineligible for Benefit, were idle.   In fact, if account is taken of the short time workers who oould not qualify for Benefit, it is probably true to say that in June not more than one out of every two Industrial workers in the country, for a working population of over 12 millions (excluding Agriculture and Domestic Servioe), was engaged in whole-time employment.That the oountry oould have passed so quietly through a orisis so severe is due in the main to the timely provision of the Unemployment Insurance Aots supplemented by the special measures adopted by the State to provide, or to assist in providing, work.But it must also be remembered that throughout this period Trade Union funds and private resources were available to eke out the Insurance Benefit and to enable the workingH olasses to maintain life.   Trade Union funds and privateresources are now to a large extent exhausted,the amount of the Benefit Itself has been reduced from 20/- to 15/-, and itwould be unsafe to assume that if we are confronted this next winter with widespread unemployment, the country will remain as quiet.*.      1     M
It will be within the knowledge of my colleagues that the finance of the Unemployment insurance Act of last March .1s based upon the assumption that the numbers of unemployed persons qualified for benefit will average 1,250,000 week by week throughout the period July 1921 to June 1922,(inclusive).There are signs of a trade revival, and since the Miners returned to the pits, the unemployment figures show a steady though slow decline week by week.    It is my expectation that the number will drop to 1,250,000 by the end of December, but judged by normal industrial experience this is &amp; grave figure and gives ground for anxietyI ought also to say that at this moment there is aAm.recq&amp;desoence of the pressure for assistance for unemployed persons, with which I was very familiar in the fall of last year and before the Amended Insurance Acts were torought to bear upon the situation.Between now and the end of October this m&amp;y, and probably will, seriously develop.   It is due to the fact that the 16 weeks benefit to run from last March to the end of October (provided by the Act of last March) plus the additional 6 weeks of the Act of July 1st, is being exhausted week by week for increasingly large numbers of persons.Further,the number of men employed ori Relief Works is steadily declining.    And, finally, the expenditures of Poor law Guardians during the past 10 months have made it increasingly difficult for them to continue the-relief whioh they have been giving either in supplement of Unemployment Benefit or to those not receiving it,I bring this matter before my colleagues before we break up.     I know the difficulties with whioh the Chancellor  -of the Exchequer is confronted.   But it is my duty to ask the Cabinet to give consideration to the problem; and, at least
to decide that the Unemployment Committee of the Cabinet for whioh a Chairman will have to be appointed   -   should remain in being in order that collective attention may &quot;be concentrated upon the problem   -   and concentrated quickly if &amp;nd when the need arises.(Signed) *D.J.
