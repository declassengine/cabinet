KIS DOCUMENT IS TIES PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT AMI C MAJESTY1 S GO VliRMlCTT).g 0 R S T.cp. 3219*CABINET.REPORT BY THE GENERAL OFFICER COMAHDING-IN-CHIEF ON THE SITUATION 1ST IRELAiTD FOR WEEK ENDING 6th AUGUST, 1921.(Circulated by the Secretary of State for Tar) t[1* GENERAL^SITUATION^   During the period under review the agree-ment has been well kept on the whole.   There have been a few cases of persecution of loyalists and one case verbally reported, but unconfirmed, of a man being warned out of the country by the I.R.A.   On the other hand I.R.A. activity has been intensi-fied everywhere and in consequence there has been a decrease in the optimism felt by all classes when the agreement first came into force.As regards the progress and trend of the present conversa-tions information is vague and contradictory and nothing of a definite or accurate nature has been received.   Opinions vary according to the political, temperamental   or religious view of the informant.   The secrets of the terras offered and the course of the negotiations have been extremely well kept, pre-sumably because very few people know then.   There are some indica-tions that there is a division of opinion among the leaders and that de Valeraj Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins are in favour of acceptance and that Richard Mulcahy, Austin Stack and Erskine Childers wish to obtain still more liberal terms or continue hostilities.   This opinion however is given with reserve.There is little doubt that the majority in the 26 counties wish for peace and acceptance of the terms which are generally believed to be unexpectedly generous - though this generosity is not admitted.   Publication of the terns would probably strengthen this wish and possibly the hands of the moderate leaders.   Meanwhile though the people want peace they take practically no public action to impress their views on their leaders. - 1 -
- .    . 77It is evident that-&amp; the- present time BubLin is the centre &apos;r\f-interest,&apos; but the attitude of Belfast is also- extremely important and there are signs that the I.R.A. in general look with interest on the attitude adopted in regard to peace by their units in Cork and the South-We stern counties, which is regarded as the battle front, and where the I.-R.A, are perhaps regarded as &quot;storm troops&quot;. The Roman Catholic Church have given no open sign of their atti-tude, but will probably exert&quot; what influence they have in the direction of peace,2&apos; ACTIVITIES-Off IAAr   From ail parts of the 26 counties there are reports that the I.K.A.- are extremely active at present.   At first the men &quot;on the run&quot; all came back to their homes and, in some cases they drank heavily, made themselves generally conspicu-ous and were inclined &quot;to trail their coxts&quot;.   A considerable pro-portion of these men has now been recalled, partly perhaps because they talked too much but also no doubt to assist in the drill and training of recruits and conscripted men.   It is not known whether the men so engaged received &quot;on the   run&quot; pay; which apparently ceased when they returned, to their homes and to the lack of which and the good time they had when they lived on the country may be attributed&apos; the reports that in some areas the extremists are already tired of the truce.I.R.A.- activities consist in:-(l) Levying money.-(2) Recruiting.(3) Importing arms into the country, (4) Training.(5/ Individual and local propaganda,-(6) Police duties by I.RvA.Reports of importations of arms come from various parts of the country, and there is little reason to doubt their accuracy.   The precautions taken in the English ports are ludicrously inadequate and ineffective, and unless&apos; the control and searching at the ports is greatly improved there is no reason why the ivR,A* should not bring in as many rifles as they are able to buyVfurther information has now been received about the &quot;Liaison^ officers,&apos; and the &quot;principle on which they were selected seems to have been to choose men with local influence but not the mostimportant/
important men of the I*R.A. who are probably- required for re-organization purposes.3* ZS2I,4 TM2^* s*-nn Fein Propaganda compalgn-continues-with,.greet vigour.    The Crown Forces are still maligned with bril-liant disregard of essential facts.     There have been one or two signs that a hand is being held out towards Ulster.     In a recent Bulletin it was written that &quot;we believe that free agreement between the North and the South will be reached....,........... as soon as the decision rests in the hands ofIrishmen alone&quot;, and there is little mention of recent events In Belfast,    Propaganda is also aimed at allaying the fears of those who fear the strategical results of an Independent Ireland, and in one number of the Bulletin there is an Inter-esting dissertation to prove that there could not be an Irish army or navy which would be a danger to the Empire in time of war.Above all, propaganda is directed towards the raising of the moral of the I.R.A. and towards proving that the methods of the I.R.A. are legitimate.    This may indicate that a renewal of hostilities is imminent, but it also shows that a continuance of the truce is regarded with anxiety as likely to weaken the bonds of discipline and to decrease the efficiency of the Irish irregular forces.Everywhere the people are taught to believe that a victory has been won over the Crown Forces.    This stimulates support of the I.R.A. and would at tho same time enable the leaders t;o&apos; persuade their followers to accept terms which fall far short of the independent republic, which has been so persistently held out as the goal of their endeavours. In one county at least they are told that what brought the Government to their knees was the burning of the houses of loyalists, and plans are being made to carry out such burnings on a larger scale if no agreement is reached.     It is also generally believed that de Valera can and will extract
better terms if the present ones are not good enough end it is conceivable that an attempt will be made to show that, if they are accepted, they have been improved during the con-versations.4* CONCLUSIONS.     On the whole the prospect is that a settle-ment will be reached and the moderates among Sinn Fein will carry the day against the extremists, but there Is real danger that any loss of vigilance or alertness by the Crown Forces might tempt the extremists to some precipitate action or to an attempt to force a quarrel on them, so that it could be claimed that they and not the I.R.A. were responsible for a renewal of hostilities.    There is also reason to believe that the I.R.A, are afraid that they have 1,given themselves away&quot; during the truce and that they will make, and are making, efforts to find out all they can about the Crown Forces,     It is reported that the Cumann-na-mBan are in charge of this branch of secret service and will fraternise to this end, possibly to the extent of being more than sisters to some members of the Crown Forces.5. RKLIASFS OF PRISONERS AND INTSRN2ES.     In no spirit of criticism of the action thought necessary by the Government I think it ia well to record, events that have taken place during the period under review from a purely military stand-point .Some weeks ago I pointed out that one of the greatest anxieties felt by the troops wag &quot;lest the snorball of con-cession should develop into an avalanche&quot;.    The more the policy of &quot;concession by instalments&quot; is followed, the greater the danger of the avalanche.     In this connection, it is interesting to study the sequence of events which has now resulted i&quot;-. the release of all the members of &quot;Dail Eireann&quot;,
including those nominated at the election in May, who have yet &quot;taken their seats&quot;.On 30th June, without any reference to G.H.Q. the Irish Government ordered the release of Arth .? Griffiths and Professor McNeil, and later on the same day of E.J. Duggan and Michael Staines.    On the following day Robert Barton was released from jail in England, presumably on orders received from the Home Secretary,Shortly after preparations commenced for the release of Desmond Fitzgerald, the reason given that Erskihe Childere, the new &quot;Minister of Propaganda&quot; was so extreme that he was embarrassing his leaders in their efforts to create the atmosphere necessary for a peaceful settlement.    Accordingly on 15th July, in order to control his subordinate, Desmond Fitzgerald was released from RATH Internment Camp at the Curragh.    This man is a weak Idealist and dreamer, whOj once he found himself again in the limelight, was unable to control even himself,    His release has led to no noticable moderation of the tone of SinnFein propaganda.On 24th July, the Irish Government directed that the Countess Markienictz and Jossph McGrath should be released. The reason given for the selection of these two individuals was that they held &quot;cabinet rank&quot; In Dail Eireann&quot;, and would assist in the negotiations owing to their influence with the women and with labour respectively,    Simultaneously a compaign was started in the Irish Press for the release of all members of &quot;Dail Eireann&quot;, whether in jail or In lntem-ment camps.Meanwhile as the result of the decision of the master of the Rolls, and of the attitude adopted by the IrishGovernment, two men, Egan and Higgins, who had been condemnedto death in the Martial Law Area, were released.    This was referred to in my last report.-5-
On 4th August Mr, de Valera issued a notice, summoning all members of the Dail Eireann to meet on 16th August. On Saturday, 8th August, the Cabinet decided in order to facilitate negotiations, to release the 37 members of the Dail Eireann in prison and in internment.I have been informed that the Castle Authorities were acquainted a week before of the fact that these releases were in contemplation.    It might have been useful had I been also Informed.(Sgd)   C.F.N. Macready.General,G.H.Q. IRELAND.Commanding-in-Chief, IRELAND.9th August, 1921,-G-
