123THIS DOCUMENT IS THS PROPERTY 0* HIS BRITARIJIC MAJfiSWS OOVERMEHT).S B 0 E E f iCP.-3229.CABINS T.(Ilote by Mr. Churchill).In my capacity as Chairman of the Imperial Communications Committee, I desiro to call the attention of the Cabinet to the urgent necessity of now authorising the funds required for erecting tho Stations of the Imperial 7/ireless Scheme.If the promise of expediting this work, which was made at the Imperial Conference is to be fulfilled, no time can be lost.        The undertaking is a very large and difficult one, and it is imperative that such arrangements should bo made now as will minimise tho possibility of extended delays *The total estimated cost of the scheme is  1, 50,000. Of this about  050,000 falls to be borne by the Home Govern-, ment, the balance being contributed by Australia, Africa and.India.      I understand that orders for about &amp;500.000 will require to be placed before tho end of the financial year.      I propose that this should be charged to the Colonial Office Vote.It is my intention to set up an &quot;Erecting Authority&quot;, incorporating the existing Wireless Commission (i.e* the experts who have been engaged in the design and research experimental stage) and adding to their numbers an independent Chairman and the permanent Head of the Crown Agents for the Colonies, whose extensive erganisatioi I desire to utilise for the placing of the contracts, and the engineering knowledge required.The Crown A rents have already had considerable experience in the erection oJ ?/ireless Equipment, and as
I understand that the Post Office engineering departments are already almost over-burdened with work:, and are likely to he taxed in the near future beyond the limits of their ability to cope with telophonio extensions, I anticipate that the work will be more seditiously carried out if it is brought directly under my immediate control.My colleagues will remember that they are already committed to the adoption of tho scheme recommended by the Borman Committee, while the only money yet authorised is the sum of  80,000 on the Post Office Vote of this yeei       some of whioh is expended un&amp;er my authority by the V/ireless Commission on their experimental work.All these proposals have been most carefully considered, by Sir James Stevenson who is of opinion that they constitute the best means of expeditious progress.(Initialled)     9.3*0&apos;*OOMIAL OFHCE.August 15th, 1921.
