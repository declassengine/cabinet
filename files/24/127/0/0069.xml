This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECBET.CP. 3267.THE CABINET.THE TURKISH GENDARMERIE.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith a memorandum by the General Staff on the Turkish Gendarmerie.L. W.-E.The War Office,29th August, 1921.I.-THE TURKISH GENDARMERIE ACCORDING TO THE TREATYOF SEYRES.1. The Turkish Gendarmerie was formed and organized in 1904 by the Italians. It was not until 1912 that the French came upon the scene, when General Bauman took charge.   He effected many reforms and was succeeded by General Foulon in 1913.2. After the Armistice, General Foulon appeared ,at Constantinople on the French Staff, and obtained authority from the Grand Vizier to get in touch with the Turkish Gendarmerie departments His idea was to exert an influence indirectly, with a view to ensuring French control of the Gendarmerie eventually. Several French officers were employed under Foulcn, who induced the Turkish Gendarmerie authorities to issue instructions that the orders of French officers were to be obeyed.These officers were never officially recognized either by the Turkish government or by the British Commander-in-Chief.When Colonel Foulon died in 1920 the Turkish Minister of the Interior wrote to the Turkish Commandant-General of Gendarmerie pointing out the unofficial position which General Foulon had occupied, and directing that an Italian, Colonel Caprini, should be recognized as Inspector-General until the inauguration of the Commission of&quot; Control and Organization.A French officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Viet, however, continued to issue orders to the Gendarmerie and appears to have been appointed by the French to succeed Foulon. He delivered a lecture in Constantinople claiming that the French had done much good work in helping the Gendarmerie since the Armistice, and that they should have full control of the Turkish Gendarmerie.3. The organization of the Gendarmerie is dealt with in the military clauses of the Treaty of Sevres, vide Appendix A.4. It was originally decided that the President of the Inter-Allied Commission of Control and Organization should &quot;be British.   As regards the Sub-Commissions, the President of the Sub-Commission of Control was to bp Italian and the President of&apos; the Sub-Commission of Organization was to be British.General Franks was nominated to be the British President of the Sub-Commission of Organization in accordance with the above decision.5. General Harington. on his * arrival at Constantinople, submitted certain proposals regarding the Inter-Allied Commission of Control and Organization (Appendix B).-(b21/278)   70   8/21   h&amp;s, ltd. .9419vro
Paris, 386, dated6. From the beginning the French made every effort to obstruct the decision in paragraph 4, although they had been allotted the chairmanship of the Financial Commission and the presidency of the Naval Commission.It was finally decided that the whole question should be settled as follows : (1.) The Allied Commander at Constantinople to be British and to be President of the Inter-Allied Commission of Control and Organization.(2.) The Sub-Commission of Control to be presided over by an Italian.(3.) A Sub-Commission of Special Elements to be presided over by a British officer.(4.) The Sub-Commission of Gendarmerie to be presided over by a French officer. (5.) The permanent Secretary-General of the Financial Commission to be French. (6.) The Inspector-General of Customs to be British.(7.) An appointment of a similar nature to be given to an Italian to maintain the principle of equal distribution.F.O.,E. 13500/ 9075/44, dated 11.11.21.F.O.,E. 14536/ 9075/44, dated 25.11.21.F.O.,15597/9074/44,dated14.12.20.E. 66/22/44, dated&apos; 8.1.21.N.B. It will be noted that the above involves separate sub-commissions for the Gendarmerie and for the &quot;special elements&quot; which were originally to be dealt with by one sub-commission, vide Article 200 (2) of the Treaty.7. The Italian Government have put forward a proposal that the presidency of the Sub-Commissions should be held by the British, French and Italians in rotation. This is natural from their point of view, since the Sub-Commission of Control, over which they preside, should cease when the disarmament of Turkey is complete, six months after the ratification of the Treaty. The French Government might not be prepared to give up the Gendarmerie Sub-Commission after a period of two years. This question is now under consideration by the War Office.8. As regards the spheres in which the Gendarmerie were to be allotted to the British, rTrench and Italians, it was originally intended to allot to the French and Italian authorities the control and organization of the Gendarmerie and other, special military elements in the spheres of economic privilege allotted to them under the Tripartite Agreement, while the British would exercise the same functions in North-West Anatolia.Both the French and Italian Governments objected to this proposal. They proposed that North-West Anatolia should be. divided info a British, French and Italian zone.The Foreign Office agreed to the above and suggested that the division of North-West Anatolia should be decided by the military.9. The only questions which remain to be settled in connection with the Turkish Gendarmerie which is to be established according to the Treaty of Sevres are (i.) Whether the presidency of the sub-commission of Gendarmerie is to be heldin rotation by representatives of the three Powers concerned, (ii.) How North-West Anatolia shall be divided into three territorial areas in which shall be employed the Gendarmerie organized by officers of the three countries concerned.This question is to be left to the Inter-Allied Military Commission of - Control and Organization to settle.Harington, 179, dated 12.4.21.II.-THE ORGANIZATION OF TEMPORARY GENDARMERIE.1. The question of the organization of Temporary Gendarmerie, as distinct from the organization laid down in the Treaty of Sevres, originated in a suggestion, put forward by the French, that-the Scutari Turkish Gendarmerie should be reconstituted, and that detachments should be sent to Shile and other places on the Ismid Peninsula, where disturbances had taken place. Incidentally they stated that Commandant Yiet carried out the functions of Inspector of Ottoman Gendarmerie.These proposals appear to have been counter-proposals to certain suggestions originally put forward  by General Harington to  raise auxiliaries . in the  Ismid
-    361- 3. &apos; - - &apos;Peninsula which were, obstructed by Sir A. Block&apos;s financial colleagues, and were an attempt by the French to get special consideration in the organization of any Temporary Gendarmerie which might be raised.General Harington replied that he approved on condition that the following points were observed in the British area : (1.) The establishment of this Gendarmerie would not prejudice the future actionof His Majesty&apos;s Government. (2.) General Harington would deal direct with Turkish Chief of Gendarmerie. (3.) He would be entitled to appoint or remove any one he pleased, (4.) All officers to be British, and subject only to such inspectorate as may beappointed by him.2. The War Office asked the Foreign Office to recommend these proposals to the French ancl Italians in order to ease the difficult position in Constantinople. They suggested that if the French objected to the proposal in paragraph 1, then General Harington should be allowed to form his own Gendarmerie in the Ismid Peninsula, as distinct from reconstituting the existing Gendarmerie, which is in the area for which the British are entirely responsible.The Foreign Office a,greed, and asked Ambassadors to sound the French and E. 4596/ Italian Governments accordingly. dated23.4.21.3. General Harington reported on 27th April, 1921, that he had got 150 gendarmes 245, dated working, and proposed-to establish a company at Shile and another at Scutari, with a27-4-21. few Turkish cavalry based on Scutari.He hoped to do the same in the Chanak area later.General Harington sent details of his proposals to the High Commissioner, CE. Constantinople, as well as to the French and Italian Commanders on the 4th May (see ^j^^1&apos; Appendix C). &apos;4. The British High Commissioner submitted the proposals to his Allied colleagues Rumbol(j &apos; and they approved of them. 333,dated 7.5.21. Harington, C.R. 433256, dated 11.5.21.5. The French Government then replied to our Foreign Office note demurring to F.O., the proposals to reconstruct the Scutari Gendarmerie.    The Foreign Office considered l&apos;^79/ that as General Harington had already acted, with the consent of the High Coin- ,ja(e(j&apos; missioners at Constantinople, it did not seem expedient to continue the negotiations.      18.5.21.The organization of the Gendarmerie was therefore continued, and an estimate of    . &apos; cost was sent to Sir Adam Block.6. Commandant Viet then interfered by issuing instructions to Ali Kemal Pasha, CE. Commandant-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie.   These instructions were issued subsequently to the meeting at which the Allied High Commissioners agreed to the formation of the 13,5.21. Gendarmerie (vide paragraph 4).    Viefs action rendered -the position of Ali Kemal impossible as he was receiving instructions from both Viet and the British, and the Gendarmerie inspectorate under Viet bad never been recognized by the British.7. The Allied High Commissioners then protested to the British High Commissioner Eatigan, at what they called &quot;the unjustifiable action of the&apos; British Military Authorities in 381,^ dated interfering with the organization of the Scutari Battalion.&quot;   They objected particularly&apos;9-0,21&apos; to fixing special rates of pay.   The British High Commissioner pointed out that this question originated with the Turks, owing to the difficulty in finding officers.8. After consulting General Harington and others, the British authorities at Constantinople agreed that the only solution, if the French and Italians maintained their present attitude, would he to ask the Ottoman Government to form the battalion under British direction and to offer to find the money for the. payment of officers and men.9. The Army Council, on being informed of the above, agreed to the proposal to 0152/5774, ask the Ottoman Government to raise the battalion.   They pointed out that unless the dated battalion was properly paid and fed, it would be unreliable and. therefore worse than3-0-21, useless, and might even become a reinforcement to the Nationalists when there was nO longer any Greek force between it and the Nationalists.   The present rates of pay in(9419) A 2

It was suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Government should find&quot; a sum not exceeding 3,000 . a month to improve the Turkish rates of pay, but the Army Council were not prepared to find this from Army funds.10. General Harington then reported that, to maintain law and order, a similar Gendarmerie was necessary in the Chanak area. He pointed out that the French were forming Gendarmerie at Chataldja, and that the Italians were doing the same at Pera and on the Bosphorus.11. Officers were asked for to serve in these Gendarmeries, and the Treasury sanctioned the appointment of six.12. Meanwhile, the discussion regarding the Presidency of the Commissions of Control and the Allied Command had been settled by the British, French and Italian Governments as follows : (i.) General  Harington  to   assume command  of all  the Allied  troops in Constantinople.(ii.) Sub-Commission of Control to be presided over by an Italian officer, (in.) Sub-Commission of special elements to be presided over by a British officer, (iv.) Sub-Commission of Gendarmerie to be presided over by a French officer.(v.) Permanent Secretary-General of the Financial Commission to be French, (vi.) Inspector-General of Customs to be British.(vii.) A similar appointment to be found for a,n Italian to maintain the principle of equal distribution.13. The Foreign Office thereupon addressed the French and Italian Governments on the subject of the temporary Gendarmerie, and asked them whether they would consent to the principle that the Ottoman Government should meet the expenditure which would be incurred. They pointed out that this force was formed ,in May, with the approval of the Allied High Commissioners, that the maximum strength would be 600, and &quot;the total cost 3,000z. sterling per month. The British officers would be paid by His Majesty&apos;s Government..14. The Ambassador in Paris, on receipt of this, asked whether the difference in view between the French Central Government and the French authorities at Constantinople which was originally revealed (vide paragraphs 4 and 5) had been overcome, in view of the decision regarding the Allied Command and the constitution of sub-commissions which had now been arrived at (vide paragraph 12).15. The Foreign Office replied that originally the French Government objected on the grounds that the proposal to form this Gendarmerie prejudge-d the whole question of the future organization of the Turkish Army which was closely connected with the dispute about the sub-committee of organization.This latter question had now been settled to the satisfaction of the French, and, moreover, the proposed arrangement for the Ismid Gendarmerie was a temporary measure, to me;et a special local need, and was quite independent of the general arrangements contemplated for the Turkish Gendarmerie formed under the Treaty of Sevres.16. General Harington then proposed that as the French are to have the Presidency of the Gendarmerie Sub-Commission eventually, he should form a small temporary committee under French presidency to co-ordinate the work and organization of the various temporary Gendarmeries that have been formed, namely, under the British at Scutari and Chanak, under the French at Chataldja, and under the Italians at Pera and on the Bosphorus. He hoped this arrangement would ease the friction that existed over the Gendarmerie question, and serve as a set-off to his assumption of command.He gave it-as an additional reason that it would help to alleviate the feeling that the British have now too much control at Constantinople.17. The questions regarding the temporary Gendarmerie which remain to be settled are : (1.) Whether the French and Italian Governments will consent to the principle , &quot; that the Ottoman Government should meet the expenditure incurred on theScutari Gendarmerie; the total cost being 3,000z. a month, exclusive of the pay of the British officers, which is being met by His Majesty&apos;s Government.
(.2.) * Whether a temporary committee should be formed to co-ordinate the work and organization of the various temporary Gendarmeries that have been v formed by each of the three Powers in occupation at Constantinople.   It is to be understood that the President of the Committee will be a French officer and the members will be one British and one Italian officer.general staff, War Office,Ath August, 1921.* The Foreign Office have now agreed to the formation of this temporary committee, subject to the E. 9117/ concurrence of Sir Horace Rumbold, and to the condition that the arrangement shall be limited to the period 22/4=4, of the Armistice.   General Harington has been informed of this decision. da ted17.8.21.89646,dated16.8.2189661,dated18.8.21.

The Principal Allied Powers reservo the right to decide, at the end of this period, whether it is desirable to-maintain or suppress this section of the said Commission.APPENDIX B.C.I.G.S.,1. In view of the forthcoming Conference in London, I am submitting to you my appreciation of the situation in my position as President of the Inter-Allied Mission of Control and Organization responsible for enforcing the military clauses of the Treaty.2. 1 have studied the problem for some time past, and have approached it entirely as a military problem entirely divorced from politics, which are no concern of mine.   .I have no idea whatever as to the views of the Government as to any possible modification of the Treaty, or whether any modification is even contemplated.My statement is merely intended to give you a picture-(a.) Of my views as to how I propose to carry but the military clauses of the Treaty as they now stand,supposing the Treaty is ratified without modification ; (b.) Of my views as to what modification might be made in the military clauses in order to build a morestable Turkey ;(c.) Of how 1 would propose to enforce the military clauses supposing such modifications were made; (d.) Of my proposals for the organization of the future civil, urban and rural police force of Turkey.o. The problem is an intensely interesting one requiring very careful organization. The one essential is for the Allies to work together on uniform lines. Progress will depend entirely ou the terms which are ratified eventually.To enforce the existing- Treaty progress will be slow, as the Turks will be sullen, though docile, as they naturally expect modification.If the Powers grant, modification progress will naturally be quicker, as I think one can then count on the loyal support of the Turks in setting their house in order.4. (a.) (i.) I attach as Appendix 2 my proposals for the organization of the Gendarmerie and special elements as laid down by the Treaty.This organization is under Major-General Pranks, the President of the Sub-Commission of Organization.The proposals are, in my opinion, sound and workable, imd as far as the British section is concerned they could be put into operation at once on ratification.Since I have arrived here I have seen nothing to modify my view that, in light of the few men whom Turkey will be allowed to enrol, the Gendarmerie should as far as possible be organized on practically military lines. I am entirely opposed to any idea of distributing this force in small police posts, who will merely lend themselves to corruption and intrigue.(ii.) Kqually I am opposed to any idea of mixing the nationality of the Allied officers to be employed with the Gendarmerie in the various units. I consider that any such system would inevitably lead to innumerable references to headquarters, possibly necessitaiing further reference to higher authority, which&apos; would hold up any real progress. Each of the Allied nations should have a definite responsibility for a definite area through the President of the Commission. 1 realize that there will be considerable difficulty in defining areas so as to suit all parties, but I am confident that this can be done by mutual arrangement here if the Governments concerned are determined to coroperate.(iii.) For identical reasons I adhere to the opinion that no Council or Committee of Generals should be interposed between the President of the Military Commission of Control and Organization and the.Presidents of the two Sub-Commissions. 1 consider that such a system apart from being opposed to the economical form of supervision dictated by the Treaty would involve endless references and little or no actual progress. Also the future organization should be kept entirely distinct from the Army of Occupation, with which it has no real connection, and which need not have the same length of life. Further, it may be realized that if the Army of Occupation is reduced in size the Entente Powers will not presumably keep General Officers in command of the reduced contingents. In short, the simpler the preliminary machinery the more direct will be the results.(iv.) My idea is to start with raising three battalions locally. The only important outstanding points are: (1.) The definition of the British Zone.(2.) The terms of service and pay of all ranks.I cannot speak for the French and Italians.The former will not discuss pending instructions from Paris, delayed presumably by the fact that they claim the Presidency of the Sub-Commission of Organization. The Italians are now beginning to examine the subject and will, I think, follow our general lines.I attach as Appendix 6 my proposals for the organization of the Sub-Commission of ^Control.
365(9419)General Mombelli, Italian Army, has apparently been appointed President of this Sub-Commission, and I am awaiting his arrival in order to discuss his proposals with him.This Sub-Commission could start work at once on his arrival. &quot;:V\  To. sum up, I am confident that the spado work of the British side of the mission with which I am to be entrusted has been carried out, and that if the Treatv is to bo carried out without alterations, the machinery could be put in motion at an early date, provided :: &quot;,y.-     (1.) Other Allies send their representatives.(2.) My position as the responsible head is made clear, aud Major-General Franks&apos; position also. (3.) The extent of financial support is known.(J.) (i.) It is with diffidence that I put forward any proposals as regards modification of the military clauses as I have not been asked for any, and do not know if any modification is contemplated.It will, however, be realized that the situation has undergone a radical change since the Treaty was drafted. At that time presumably only the measures necessary for the internal security of Turkey were envisaged. Without reintroduciug the question of whether the force allowed by the Treaty might be sufficient for that purpose alone, it will be remembered that White Russia was still in the field, Azerbaijan had not capitulated to the Bolsheviks, Armenia had still to be arnrjd, aud promised to defend herself, and Nationalist negotiations with the Bolsheviks were not so far advanced as is now the case.Since my arrival here I have given this matter my earnest thought, and it. seems to me that if Turkey is to be gisvn a chance of re-establishing her independence she must be given sufficieiit force to make this possible. Ot lerwise there is a grave danger that her protection will some day become a charge against the Entente.(ii.) Viewed as a military problem only, and basing my ar^umente upon considerations of history, geography, communications and man-power, I cannot see that the 35,000 Gendarmerie and 15,000 Special Elements could effectively control the vast area of Turkey and guard her frontiers.When Turkey had an army before the -war of 38 divisions, the role of the Gendarmerie was police work,, and the Gendarmerie was distributed into hundreds of police packets.In the proposals for the new Gendarmerie 1. have departed from this idea and propose more concentration and greater efficiency.My idea is that the 35,000 Gendarmerie should resemble as far as possible the iioyal Irish Constabulary,, backed in this case by the 15,000 Special Elements.(iii.) It is the latter, however, which I consider is inadequate to cope with existing conditions.The area is so vast aud communications so bad that it seems to me that nothing less than an army of 15 divisions could deal effectively with the problem.The attached map shows that Turkey had 10 divisions in the area with which we are now concerned.My proposal is that 15 divisions of 2,000 men each, distributed as shown on attached map, be allowed.1 have suggested&apos;2,000, which is only a nucleus, but its increase to, say, 5,000 or more, would depend-on the good faith or otherwise shown by Turkey.The question of conscription would require re-consideration. It might be possible to raise the proposed peace cadres of divisions by voluntary enlistment if funds were forthcoming, some form of conscription becoming permissible.upon mobilization.If this proposal was entertained, I would then recommend that the role of the 35,000 Gendarmerie be as before the war.My immediate proposal, therefore, amounts to : (i.) An army of 30,000.(ii.) A Gendarmerie of 35,000.Details such as the proportion of mounted troops and artillery could be considered later, (c.) (i.) The above presupposes that both the Army and Gendarmerie would be organized and controlled by Allied officers.On the supposition that each ally would be responsible for certain definite divisions, I am of opinion that; an exactly similar organization to the one which I have put forward in Appendix 2 for the organization of the Gendarmerie would be suitable for organizing the army. The same staff as that contemplated for the Gendarmerie might even be used with slight additions and economy be so effected.lii.) It might even be possible to entrust the formation of the army to the British and entrust the formation of the Gendarmerie to the French, who claim vested rights therein.(iii.) Another point which arises in the Tripartite Agreement. I understand that the Turks are very averse to this agreement on the ground that it splits their country into 3 zones, and they ask for all the Allies to be represented in each zone. \- I am certain that it would be impossible for any progress or executive action to be taken by the Allies conjointly. I would suggest that at each corps and possibly divisional headquarters the other Allies should be represented not executively but as liaison officers or watchers. This would, 1 think, give the safeguard which the Turks want.((/.) (i.) As regards the civil, urban and rural police of Turkey, though the number of these is, in accordance with Article 200, to be fixed by the Military Sub-Commission of Control, it is clearly stated in Article 170 that these are to be quite distinct from the armed forces of Turkey. With this principle I am in absolute concurrence as. I wish to keep all non-military questions free from military interference as soon as they can be disentangled.I am, however, concerned regarding the future of the Inter-Allied Military Police at Constantinople-This body raised, officered and partially manned by the army of occupation as an armistice measure has done invaluable work under its Chief, Colonel Ballard,and by common consent has justified its existence. I consider-that it should be retained as a permanent service and should be open for the employment of military officers-I think, however, that it should pass from military to civil control after the ratification of peace. Its duties are not military and part of the value of the force is the executive magisterial authority held by its officers which at present replaces the capitulations.Its present strength is : Officers. Other ranks.       -  &apos;British..       .. &apos;     ..       13 48French..       .....    10 115Italian......       10 122
(ii.) Article 170 of the Treaty of Sevres allows for a Turkish Police Force with Allied officers in the Turkish service, and it might be possible to retain the present Allied force as a Turkish service with a nominal Turkish head. It must, however, be recognized that as a Turkish service the police might lose some of their present value as their powers over non-Turkish subjects would become restricted.I&apos;do not think that it could be retained suitably under Article 48, which allows for the organization of a special police force under the Straits Commission with foreign officers and which under Article 39 will presumably have powers on shore. I have considered this possibility but feel that it might lead to a clash between the authority of the Straits Commission and the Council of Ambassadors in Constantinople, In any case I feel that the services of Colonel Ballard and his officers should be retained in some form under civil authority. . iC. H. HARINGTON, Lieutenant-General, Commamting-in- Chief,Constantinople, Army of the Blatk Sea.7th February, 1921.APPENDIX C.INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING EMPLOYMENT OF OTTOMAN GENDARMERIE IN THE ZONE OF BRITISH COMMAND DURING THE ARMISTICE PERIOD.I. Policy.(a.) In order to avoid international friction it is necessary, pending ratification of peace or the nomination by the Allies of a definite date upon which peace organizations shall function, to avoid any prejudice to future decisions regarding the organization and control of Ottoman Gendarmerie.(5.) The Conimander-in-Chief has, however, decided in the interests of law and order in the British zone to sanction the co-operation of Ottoman Gendarmerie in the zone under his command commencing with the Ismid Peninsula. The organization of Gendarmerie in the Straits zone is sketched in Appendix 1. The British have never participated in the Allied Commission referred to in the Appendix nor is any Allied Inspectorship of the Ottoman Gendarmerie recognized by the Oommander-in-Chief. The Commandef-in-Chief has, therefore, decided that Ottoman Gendarmerie co-operating with British troops shall be treated as British Auxiliaries in the service of law and order who shall be assisted, guided and controlled by British supervising officers. He has explained his views personally to Ali Kemal Pasha, Commaudant-in-Chief of Ottoman Gendarmerie, who lias promised his loyal co-operation.II. Chain of Command and Channel ok Correspondence. It must be understood that the Gendarmerie are at present administered by the Ottoman Minister of the Interior aud not by the Minister of War, i.e., they are primarily a civil as opposed to a military instrument.   In order to avoid as far as possible the multiplication of channels of correspondence the Commander-in-Chief has decided upon the following procedure: (a.) Questions of policy regarding the employment of Gendarmerie requiring the intervention of the High Commissioner will be dealt with by the Commander-in-Chief through his own staff.(i.) All liaison and correspondence with the Commandant-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie shall be conducted by the British Military Representative at the Ottoman War Office (Colonel Heckwith).This officer will deal directly with the British , Supervising Officers on questions of organization, administration and interior economy of the Gendarmerie and where it is not necessary to refer such questions to General Headquarters he will dispose of them in direct liaison with the Commandant-in-Chief, Ottoman Gendarmerie. Where the assistance of General Headquarters is required such questions should be referred direct to the branch of General Headquarters concerned. The Intelligence Branch of the General Staff will be kept informed of all action for purpose of record.Thus all questions regarding despatch of Gendarmerie from their headquarters into the British zone, their equipment and internal economy will be dealt with, as far as the Commandant-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie is concerned, by the British Military Representative, Ottoman War Office.(c) When once a body of Gendarmerie has arrived within a definite area within the British zone it will be considered for the purpose of civil or tactical employment at the disposal of the General Officer&apos; Commanding, 28th Division, who will issue his orders through and in consultation with the British officer supervising Gendarmerie Battalion Headquarters (Major Whittall). In cases of emergency the local Brigade Commander will issue his orders through the British- officer doing duty with the Gendarmerie in the area concerned. In all cases the British supervising officer concerned will act in liaison between &apos;the British Commander concerned and the local Turkish authority. Thus questions regarding the employment of the Gendarmerie will be dealt with by 28th Division under the Commander-in-Chiefs orders. With a view to administrative requirements, British Military Representative, Ottoman War Office, will be kept informed of all moves authorized.III. Organization.For the present one battalion will be raised. Its headquarters will be at Scutari (supervising officer, Major Whittall), with companies at  NScutari (supervising officer, Captain Armstrong;. Guebze (supervising officer, Captain Le Patourel). Shile (supervising officer, Lieutenant Coghill).IV. Employment.(a.) The Gendarmerie will perform its normal duty of maintaining security under the orders of the local Ottoman authorities subject to the consent of the local British authority which will be conveyed through the British supervising officer concerned.
No obstacle will be placed iu the way of the Gendarmerie performing&apos; these duties and it will be made clear that they are supported by British authority.The British supervising officers will ensure that no action is taken such as to bring into disrepute the employment of Ottoman Gendarmerie in the British zone. If they have cause to interfere with any action on the part of the Gendarmerie the circumstances will be reported to the local British Commander concerned.The principle will be that no move of Gendarmerie will take place at the initiation of either British or Turkish authorities without consultation with the other through the medium of the British supervising officers.V. command and discipline.British supervising officers will permit the Turkish Commanders to exercise actual command over their men, but will retain the right to intervene if necessary, acting on the principle laid down in paragraph IV.The Commander-in-Chief will require the Ottoman authorities to replace unsatisfactory personnel in the Gendarmerie, and he delegates the power to suspend&apos; Gendarmerie personnel from their duties, pending replacement, as follows : (i.) Officers of and above the rank of Kaimmakam to General Officer Commanding, 28th Division, (ii.) o her officers to Brigade Commanders, (iii.) Other ranks to British supervising officers.vi. general.There must obviously be many questions connected with the employment of the Turkish Gendarmerie in co-operatio;i with British forces which are not covered by this memorandum, but the Commander-in-Uhief relies upon the tact and good sense of all concerned to overcome difficulties&apos;.VII. employment of turkish regular cavalry.The same principles at herein hud down will apply to the employment of the squadron of regular Turkish cavalry on the Ismid Peninsula under the supervision of British officers, except that the Ottoman administrative authority for this purpose will be the Ottoman Minister of War, and the Turkish civil authorities will have no direct control over this force..

appendix 2 to General Harington&apos;s Proposals, dated 7th February, 1921, for the Organization of theTurkish Gendarmerie, $c.Minutes of a meeting at the War Office on the 1st November, 1920, in accordance with Foreign Office letter No. E/13438/9075/44, dated the 30th October, 1920, to consider the military details in connection with the Commission of Control and Organization.Present: Lieut-General Sir C. H. Harington, K.C.B., D.S.O. (in the chair).Lieut -Colonel A. Fagalde, C.M.G., D.S.O. (French Military Attache).Colonel V. Riggi, O.M.G. (Italian Military Attache).F. D. G. Osbornk, Esq. (Foreign Office&apos;).B. H. Richardson Esq. (Q.M.G.F., Foreign Office).R. J. G. C. Paterson. Esq. (F. 2, War Office).Lieut.-Colonel W. H. Gkibbon, C.M.G., C.B.E. (M.I. 2, War Office).General Harington explained the principles of his proposals, which are shown in Appendices 4 and 5, copies of which had been given to the Military Attaches on the 29th October, and the Mifitary Attaches were asked if they had any points to bring. to notice upon which it was unlikely that their Governments would agree, or which they would not feel justified in advising their Governments to accept.Colonel Fagalde said that, as regards Special &quot; Elements,&quot; he agreed that it was advisable for them to be placed as closely as possible under the direct control of the Allied Commander-in-Chief, but that it might be considered preferable to echelon them along the railway rather than keep them in the special zone of Constantinople, which is prohibited by the Peace Treaty. Later he agreed that it would be unavoidable that the Special Elements should be raised in the first place in or near Constantinople.As regards the Gendarmerie, he did not think that the French Government would contribute their full quota of officers allowed by the Treaty up to the number of 88. Otherwise he was in entire agreement with the proposals.Colonel Riggi had no criticisms to offer.Neither of the Military Attaches had yet received instructions from their Governments, bat did not anticipate that any difficulty would arise.appendix 1.1. The following is a gist of statements by General AH Kemal Pasha on the organization, pay, &amp;o., of Gendarmerie existing under the Central Government: Bach Vilayet has a Gendarmerie regiment. Each Sandjak has a Gendarmerie battalion. Each Kaza has a Gendarmerie company. Each Nahie has a Gendarmerie platoon.2. The number of battalions in a regiment varies according to the size of vilayet. The number of companies in a battalion varies according to the size of sandjak; e.g., Constantinople has 1 regiment of 3 battalions of varying strengths, comprising : 1 Pera battalion of 1 company of, roughly, 130 men.1 Stamboul battalion of 2 companies of, roughly, 550 men.1 Scutari battalion, at present non-existent, and about 10 mounted orderlies.Chataldja (an independent Sandjak) has 1 battalion of 160 to 180 men. iBrusa has 1 regiment, now of about 250 men; many men have deserted from want of pay, &amp;c. Balikessar has 1 regiment of about 300 men.Chanak has 1 regiment of about 450 men,.covering area Bigha Chanak Ezine.Total strength existing now is, very roughly, 200 officers serving (and about 300 hors de cadre) and 2,400 men.3. Two years ago, AH Kemal Pasha received a letter from the Minister of the Interior saying that the Allied High Commissioners had decided that the Gendarmerie should be controlled by an Allied Commission.4. General Franchet d&apos;Esperey detailed General Fbulon to be the French Representative, and General Charpy ordered Major Viet to take General Foulon&apos;s place after the latter&apos;s death till ratification.5. Italian officers were with the Gendarmerie till some 10 months ago or less.6. There are now about 11 French officers with the Mission, 4 or 5 at Headquarters, Scutari, and the others with the various existing regiments.7. There are also 2 French non-commissioned officers and a number of clerks and typists at Headquarters. 8. The Gendarmerie has been recruited on 3 categories with 3 varying rates of pay (a.) Men liable to militaiy service,.who elect to serve in the Gendarmerie.   Pay Ltq. 2 plus money forrations varying from Ltq. 15 to Ltq. 20 according to the varying cost of certain articles. (6.) Unmarried volunteers. Pay Ltq. 7 plus money for rations as above.(c.) Married volunteers. Pay Ltq. 12 plus-money for rations as above. No rations in kind are issued. A corporal is paid au additional 50 pts. per month. A Serjeant is paid an additional Ltq. 1 per month.For clothing during the past two years, Ltq. 180,000 has been granted. It should have been Ltq. 1,000,000.Officers are paid - Lieutenants, Ltq. 38 monthly ; Captains, Ltq. 54 monthly.A Gendarmerie School for 23 officers from those at present hors de cadre is being run near Fatih Mosque.
It was agreed that the 1st January would be a suitable date from which to start off the new organization in the various areas, aad that by that date each Power should have arranged to have the necessary officers on the spot.It was also agreed that the British War Office should initiate proposals for the terms of service which should be common to.all Allied officers serving with the Turkish forces.Mr. Paterson explained that the terms, as effecting pensions, could not bo similar for all the Allies. The British Government would require the Turkish Government to undertake certain responsibilities regarding the period of service of British officers in Turkey which would count towards pension.Colonel Fagalde pointed out that the titles &quot; Corps,&quot; &quot; Division,&quot; &amp;c, were hardly suitable to Gendar-merie.   This, however, was only a question of designation.Colonel Gribbon pointed out that no mention had been of supervising officers for the special elements ; it would be necessary to have Allied officers specially detailed for this duty.appendix 3.0152/5548.   (M.I. 2.) 9th October, 1920.;Sir,With reference to the Inter-Departmental Committee, held at the War Office on the 8th instant, under the Presidency of Major-General Sir C. H. Harington, K.C.B., D.S.O., I am commanded by the Army Council to forward, for the information of Earl Curzon of Kedleston, a copy of a Memorandum which has been drawn mp by the War Office on lines which were agreed upon at the above Meeting.I am to say that the Army Council understand that, should Lord Curzon concur in the terms of the Memorandum, he will obtain the agreement of the Allied Governments upon the points raised therein, so that the organization, which will be required to carry out the terms of the Turkish Peace Treaty, may be put in hand forthwith.Though it is hoped that agreement maj&apos; be reached at once upon the more important points, such as the date of commencement and length of tenure of the principal Command of the Memorandum (paragraphs 1 (a.) and (6.)) and control of the Special&apos;Elements of the Memorandum (paragraph 5 (h.)), in case the Allied Governments should be unwilling to agree upon all the points raised without reference to their military representative, it is suggested that a saving of time aud general convenience might be effected should the Allied Governments be prepared to detail military representatives to attend an Inter-Allied Committee to be held at the War Office in London on the first date possible. This Inter-Allied Military Committee might consider aud arrive at a definite agreement upon such points of detail as the Allied Governments are not prepared to accept without further examination.When military agreement has been reached it is hoped that the Allied Governments will be prepared to give their formal consent to the details as re-submitted, after which the organization could be proceeded with immediately.Copies of this letter have been sent to General Saokville-West and to the Admiralty.I am, &amp;c,(Signed;   B. B. CUBITT.The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office,Whitehall, S.W.appendix 4.1. In order to be able to proceed with a definite scheme for carrying out the military terms of the Turkish Peace Treaty, the Army Council would be glad if they might receive definite rulings from the Foreign Office on the following points : (a.) Duration of tenure of Supreme Command and Presidency of the Commission of Organization andControl at Constantinople by a British officer.   It is represented that this should not be less than two years from the date of ratification of the Treaty. (5.) Date of commencement of tenure, though this will presumably be the date of ratification of theTreaty, it is recommended that the Allied Commander-in-Chief should take up his appointment asfrom, the 1st November in anticipation of ratification of the Treaty, (c.) Acceptance by Allies of general chain of organization for the Sub-Commission of Organization,indicated on attached table, regarding which the following points should be noted.2. It is proposed that the British President of this Sub-Commission who would probably be a Major-General and would be seated in the Turkish War Office, should work directly under the Allied Commander-in-Chief without the intervention of any further Committee of Allied Generals. The latter, i.e., the Commander-in-Chief, would, in turn, be sub-ordinate to the Council of Ambassadors at Constantinople. The csub-Com-mission of Organization would contain a Senior Military representative of France, Italy and Japan; it is suggested that full Colonel would be a suitable rank for these representatives.3. It is proposed that the President of the Sub-Commission would ordinarily deal direct with the Turkish War Office, but in certain cases particularly in connection with the Special Elements the intervention of the Allied Commander-in-Chief would be required. It should only be necessary for the Allied commander-in-Chief to refer to the Council of Ambassadors in cases of difficulty with the Turkish War Officetor of disagreement between the Allied representatives, which could not be dealt with by him personally.4. It is proposed that Great Britain and the Allies should each be represent cd in the area with relation to the spheres laid down in the Tripartite Agreement, in which they are respectively interested with regard to the formation of the future Turkish Army, by a Senior Supervising Officer (the rank of full Colonel would
again be suitable) located at the Turkish Headquarters in the area concerned. These Senior Supervising-Officers would report to the President of the Sub-Coiuniissioii of Organization through their representatives on that Sub-Commission. The President of the Sub-Commission should be free to carry out occasional tours of inspection as required.5. The above necessitates consideration of (d.) The Tripartite Agreement, under which definite spheres are allotted to France and Italy, but none to Great Britain.   It is presumed that Great Britain would undertake the provision of officers for, and the supervision of the Gendarmerie in, the area from Brusa, inclusive, eastwards, opening up -this area as the situation permits and may be agreed.(e.) If the above is generally agreed, the War Office would propose that in the British sphere the organi-zation should be on the lines of the attached table (see Appendix 5).(/.) Payment of Allied officers attached to the Turkish Gendarmerie, who will virtually be in Turkish 1 Government employ.It will be realised that some of these Gendarmerie officers will probably be serving in a dual capacity: (i.) As Executive officers in the Turkish Gendarmerie, and (ii.) As Supervising officers under the Sub-Commission of organization,in accordance with the provision at the end of Article 159 of the Turkish Treaty, which was inserted with a. view to economy.The British Government should initiate a proposal regarding rates of payments and conditions of serviced which will presumably be equal for all the Allies.((?.) Distribution of Gendarmerie.The number of Gendarmerie allowed to the Turkish Government is 35,000. The War Office would propose to allot one third of this number, or say 11,500. to each of the spheres of interest. In each sphere they could be divided into such number of legions as desired by the Allied Power concerned, but in accordance with the conditions of .the Treaty no legion may contain more than one quarter of the total strength, i.e., 8,500.In the British sphere the War Office would propose to organize the 11,500 Gendarmerie in. two divisions-or legions. It is not expected that the establishment would be filled at once, and officers could be drafted out as units were completed.The actual number of Allied officers who might be attached to the Gendarmerie in each sphere, under the provisions of the Treaty, would be SB.(h.) As regards the Special Klements; these are different from the Gendarmerie in that no Allied officers-would be attached to them, and they are a Regular reserve to the Gendarmerie to be used as required, subject to the proviso that not more than one third of the total 15,000, 5,000 may reinforce any one Gendarmerie Legion. As it might be necessary to reinforce more than one Gendarmerie Legion or division in any one of the Allied spheres, it would not meet the. case to allot these Special Elements arbitrarily in advance at 5,000 to each Allied Sphere, and from the nature of this force it would appear advisable that the Allied Commander-in-Ohief, in his capacity as President of tho Commission of Control and Organization, should keep these Special Elements more closely under his control than should be necessary in the case of the Gendarmerie.In cnses where it was found necessary to reinforce any Gendarmerie Legion in one of the Allied spheres with Special Elements, it would probably be necessary to consult the Council of Ambassadors.Under the provisions of the Peace Treaty the Special Elements are excluded from the special zoue round Constantinople, but from the above necessity of keeping them fairly closely under, the control of the Allied Commander-in-Chief, and because of the difficulty of allotting them arbitrarily to the Allied spheres,-as well as administrative questions in connection with their organization, it will probably, in practice, be difficult to exclude the Special Elements from the Constantinople zone. It is, therefore, suggested that Allied agreement should be reached to ignore this particular restriction, which is contained in sub-paragraph (3) of Article 178 of the Treaty.(i.) Requisitioning&apos;questions arising out of Article 178, sub-paragraph 4. It is considered that the power of requisition shall be restricted to the Allied Commander-in-Chief, although each Allied General Officer Commanding should be- responsible for his own lines of communication and for m iking- the necessary recommendations for housing their own personnel. The Allied Commander-in-Chief would delegate bis authority in this matter, as far as possible. The principle should be. accepted lhat questions of priority affecting lines of communication shall be referred to the Allied Commander-in-Chief.6. The question should be definitely settled as to whether the Commissions of Control are to function in the Smyrna zone which is in Greek occupation. This requires consideration of Articles 68, 69 and 89 in connection with Article 139, which precludes the ex:ercise of only Turkish authority in territory detached from Turkey.7. The above does not touch upon the organization of the Sub-Oomrnission of Control. If any points arise which it; appears may present difficulties in&apos; connection with this Sub-Commission, the War Office propose to bring such points to the notice of the Foreign Office at an early date.War Office,Ht/i October, 1920.

The share of each of the principal Allies may amount to over 80 officers   It is for consideration whether the British officers should be dealt with by the M.S. Branch of Commander-in-Chief, or whether a special section should be formed to assist President &quot; D&quot; in this connection.Note by the General Staff, War Office, dated Wh February, 1921.5 It was agreed between the French and British Governments in September, 1920, that Versailles should take no part in settling questions arising out of the establishment of the various Commissions and-Sub-Commissions in Constantinople. The draft Memorandum, referred to in (7) above, was therefore, never presented to the Council of Ambassadors, and is therefore of no effect. In the British proposals (see Appendix Ib., paragraph 2) handed to the French and Italian Military Attaches, on 30th October, 1920, at the War Office, and which were passed by them to their Governments, it is definitely stated that the President of the Sub-Commission of Organization &quot; should work directly under the Allied Commander-in-Chief, without the intervention of any further Committee of Allied Generals.&quot;  The Military Attaches stated that they anticipated no objections to these proposals from their Governments.
appendix 6 to General Harington&apos;a Proposals, dated 7th February, 1921, for the Organization of theTurkish Gendarmerie, fj-c.0152/5548.   (M.I. 2.)Sir, 9th October, 1920.In continuation of my letter number as above, of to-day&apos;s date, I am commanded by the Army Council&apos;&apos; to point out that the above letter covers questions connected with the Command at Constantinople and the Sub-Commission of Organization only. It takes no account of questions arising from the inauguration of the Sub-Commission of Control, which will also be under the ultimate Presidency of the Inter-Allied Commander-iu-Chief.On the understanding that the first President of the actual Sub-Commission of Control will be an Italian officer, I am to suggest that, at the same time as the points raised in the memorandum forwarded with my letter quoted above are referred to the Allied Governments, the Italian Government should be approached with a view to the nomination of a President for the Sub-Commission of Control, who, it is suggested might suitably hold the rank of full Colonel, unless the Italian Government would prefer to be represented by a General Officer.I am further to suggest that the Italian Government should be invited to prepare a draft proposal for the organization of this Sub-Commission, for discussion by Allied Military Representatives at the Committee which it is hoped may be assembled at the War Office in London, and/ at which it is hoped that the points-of detail in connection with the Sub-Commission of Organization will be discussed, as proposed in my above? quoted letter.Copies of this letter have been sent to the Admiralty and General Sackville-West.I am, &amp;c,(Signed) B.
