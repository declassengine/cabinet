[This Document is tiie Property of His Britannic Majesty &apos;s Goirernntent. ] - -&quot;7/Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1921.SECRET.CP. iJjL ;THE FAMINE IN RUSSIA.I THINK the Cabinet would like to see this letter, of unimpeachable authenticity, written by au official of the Soviet Government in Russia to his brother, also a Soviet official, abroad.It describes the famine area, and the condition to which Soviet rule has brought Russia.C. of K.August 27, 1921.Russia: The Famine.(No. 332.) [BN/21, Berlin.]The following is a copy of a letter sent to Lu.tovin.ov, the acting representative of the Soviet Government at Berlin, by his brother. It gives a graphic description of&quot; the famine situation and of the powerlessness of the Soviet administration to cope with it: &quot; Dear Yury, &quot; Moscow, July 15, 1921.&quot;I have only just returned from an official journey through the famine-stricken areas along the Volga. My journey was undertaken by order of the Central Committee of the party, and I was accompanied by members of the Petrograd Soviet and delegates of Kamenev&apos;s Commission. Our terms of reference were to ascertain how far the local Committees were doing effective work, how far the instructions of the Central authorities were being carried out&quot;, and how far the resources at the disposal of local authorities were sufficient to mitigate in some degree the unparalleled disaster which has affected almost all Russia. In our native Government of Orel the position is not so acute as in the neighbouring districts. I did not fail to pay a visit to our old folk, and at the same time acquainted myself with the position both in the town of Orel and throughout the Government. It was not as bad as I thought, and the inhabitants of the Government would be able to get along all right were it not for immigrants from the famine areas, who flock in hordes to the localities where food is more plentiful.&quot; From Orel we travelled together with Lobodsky to Penza and Samara. In Samara we found ourselves in the heart of the famine area. There is absolutely nothing there. Three months&apos; blazing drought had burnt up everything. There had been no rain, and now the locusts, which had come from the South, are themselves perishing for lack of food, being unable to feed themselves off the half-burnt shoots of the corn. You cannot imagine what is going on in the towns. I made a very careful study of the famine in 1891, but the extent of the disaster which has overtaken us now surpasses by many times everything which took place then,&quot;and it must be remembered that this is only the beginning. What, then, will happen in the autumn, when the question of sowing will have to be faced, when there will be no berries, no foliage, no root crops, with which the majority of the peasants are at present feeding themselves, and on the approach of winter, when the human organism demands additional nourish-ment ? Is it to be thought that the weakened peasantry will have sufficient strength not only to carry out lumber duties, but even to supply themselves with wood ? When one thinks of all this, when one recollects our disorganised transport, the shallowness of our rivers during the present year, and, finally, our clownish administration, then it is awful-awful, both for the people and one&apos;s self. Russia has been fated &apos;to undergo a great trial, but fate is preparing an even greater trial for all of us, who are respon-sible to the people for our powerlessness to help them at this critical moment. It must not be forgotten that in the famine of 1891 we had a well-organised administrative machine, properly functioning railways, and there was finally a Government with authority in which the Muzhik had confidence and which the intelligentsia were were prepared to obey. Now there is nothing of this. At the present time the ruins of Russia are being finally ground into dust. The people will have to look to them-selves through the long, cold winter, and will have to support by themselves the struggle against hunger and cold, disease and universal chaos. Here you have rich Samara.    About   this time  formerly the whole district  was   in  the  fields485   [6853]
gathering in the harvest, and what have we now &apos;? Blackened fields ; abandoned villages, in which only the aged remain to die in their corners. There is complete silence, and it seems as though death had already passed through this once rich - country, gathering an abundant harvest. A crust of bread is what all are asking. It is in exchange for that you can buy anything (even human beings). In Saratov 1 the local Provincial Extraordinary Commission supplied us with information of a new form of speculation, eg., the sale of children into slavery by their parents and the entering of whole families into servitude for a few poods of flour. These facts were true even of former times of famine, but then it-was with the Kalmyks, Tartars and Bashkirs half savage nomads among whom the selling occurred. Now our Russian peasants are asking to be taken -into slavery, seeing in that the only salvation to unavoidable death by starvation. Where are the people gone out of the villages ? Men point to the East in the direction of Orenburg Steppes. We met two or three such hordes on our way. Of course, there was no possibility of having any talk with them ; if they had onh7&apos; known who we were it would have fared ill with us. You can-trace the track of these hordes by the burnt, black lines of the Steppe bodies of horses, remains of bivouacs, and sometimes human bodies. Yury, it seemed to me that I had been carried back into history and that Russia was again passing through the time of the great migration which entirely recast the map of -Europe. I haven&apos;t enough courage to venture a solution. T know there is no solution. The Government has none, and even the immediate future seems bound to me to be appallingly miserable. What can the Government do against the peasantry ? How will it defend itself against the reproaches of this million-headed monster? Who will stand up in their defence? You see it is impossible to depend upon the Vookhra* or upon the Red army. The fact is that all are peasants themselves aud -will soon be starving, just as the villages are starving. And what of the workmen ? Well, it cannot be said that many of them remain. Kamenev has spoken of 20,000. Well,and if there are20,000! this 20,i&apos;00 have to satisfy the demands of 6g- million Soviet officials. This 20,000 have to supply the array, and the first thing is to see that they are well fed, whereas there is no flour and apparently no possibility of expecting any. I feel myself now like a man in a house which has been burnt down, where at any moment part of a wall may give way, or a cornice crush everything which lies beneath it. I can&apos;t get this feeling off my mind, either now when I am in Moscow, or when I travelled along the dead Steppes and the abandoned villages of the dying Volga country. Others in Moscow have the same feeling. Nervousness, confusion, uncertainty of the immediate future are noticeable both in the talk and work of comrades who were formerly among the&apos; most staunch.&quot; The necessity of inviting the co-operation of representatives of the bourgeoisie and the old intelligentsia is regarded by many as the beginning of the end, and it is useless to try and disillusion anyone of the fact that the first consignment of corn from abroad, brought in without the participation of the Soviet Government and distributed by some Red Cross other than the Soviet Red Cross Quakers or anyone you like  will cause a revolution in the whole outlook of the people and transform it from being an obedient executor of the Central Government into its hated and deadly foe. They are always talking among us of the impossibility of accepting the American conditions and of the impossibility of allowing interference by foreign charitable organisations in the work of combating the famine. Those who oppose this do so purely for consideration of their own skins, for the inevitable collapse is clear to all, and besides the inevitable bloody retribution for all our failure to create a system which would have been able to help the people to save themselves from the horror of this unparalleled famine. But one must be honest even in this question. Even now we could forget the petty interests of this Utopian folly on which we have lived for the past three years, and could make a choice either to sacrifice ^0,000,000 starving people to the Utopian folly of a world revolution, and on the bones of a dying people continue to wave our party standard, or to stand together with the people, to bear its burden in order to save from starvation millions of those who are now faced with death. I have made the choice, and I am now going with the people.&quot; Good luck, dear brother.   You will understand me.   I think we will go together.&quot; Yours,&quot; N. LuTOviNdv.&quot;* Note. The Vookhra is a special home defence corps in the Red army. Ii may be described as a garrison force for guarding public buildings, supplies, &amp;c.; guarding communications, convoying trains and -water transport, &amp;c.
