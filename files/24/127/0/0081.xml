DE VALERA&apos; S REPLY TO THE PRIME MINISTER1 SLETTER - DATED AUGUST, 2%th,1921.Previous Paper - Q.P. *s 314-9, 3214.3214A, 32 58 and 3262,.(OFFICIAL TRANSLATION)Dublin. Mansion House.August 30th, 1921.The Rt, Hon. D, Lloyd George, 10, Downing Street,Whitehall, London,Sir,We,too,are convinced that it is essential that some &quot;definite and immediate progress should be made towards a basis upon which further negotiations can usefully proceed&quot; and recognise thefutility of a &quot;mere exchange&quot; of argumentative notes.    I shall therefore refrain from commenting on the fallacious historicalreferences in your last communication.   The present is the realitywith which we have to deal.    The conditions to-day are the resultant of the past accumtely summing it up and giving insimplest form the essential data of the problem.    These data are:-(1) The people of Ireland acknowledgingno voluntary union with Great Britain, and claiming as a fundamental natural right to choose freely for themselves the path they shall take to realise their national destiny, have by an overwhelming majority declared for independence,  set up a republic and more than once confirmed their choice/(2) Great Britain, on the other hand,acts as though Ireland were bound to her by a contract of union that for-bade separation.    The circumstances -of the supposed contract are notorious, yet on the theory of its validity the British Government and-Parliament .claim to rule and legislate for Ireland, even to the point of parti-ttoning Irish territory against the will of the Irish people, and killing or casting into prison every Irxsh citizen who refuses allegiance.
The proposals of your Government submitted in the draft of July 20th are based fundamentally on the latter premises.      We have rejected these proposals and our rejection, is irrevocable.      They were not an invitation to Ireland to enter into&quot;&apos; a free and willing&quot;partnership with the free nations of the British Commonwealth. They were an invitation to -Ireland to. enter in a guise and under conditions which determine a status definitely inferior to that of these free states.    Canada,Australia, South Africa,Hew Zealand,.are all guaranteed against the domination of the major state not only by the acknowledged constitutional rights--which give them equality of status with Great Britain and absolute freedom from the control of the British Parliament and government, but by the thousands of miles that separate them from. Great Britain.    Ireland would have the guarantees neither of distance nor of right.    The. conditions sought to be imposed would divide her into two artificial states,  each destructive of the ether influence in any common council,  and both subject to the Military,Haval and economic control cf the British Government.The main historical.and geographical facts are not in dispute, but your Government insists on viewing them from your standpoint.    We must be allowed to. view them from ours.    The history that you interpret, as dictating union we read as dictating separation.    Our interpretations cf the fact of &quot;geographical propinquity&quot; are no less diametrically opposed. We are convinced that ours is the true and just interpretation,, and as a proof are willing that a neutral, impartial arbitrator should be the judge.    You refuse and threaten to give effect to your view-by force.. Our, reply must be that if you adopt that course we can only resist, as the generations before us have resisted.
2,&quot;&apos;&quot;Whitehall Gardens, S.W. September 2nd, 1921.Force will.-no-t&quot; &quot;soXve^he-prrohLenu- - ^t-.jwtIIX.jaevex- -secure the ultimate victory over reason and right0   If you again resort to force and if victory be not on the side of Justice, the problem that confronts us will confront our successors. The fact that for 750 years this problem has resisted a solu-tion by force is evidence and warning sufficient.    It is true wisdom, therefore, and true statesmanship, not any false idealism, that prompts me and ny oolleaguos.   Threats of force must be sot aside,   $key amst be set aside from the beginning, as well as during the actual conduct of the negotiations.   The respective plenipotentiaries must meet untrammelled by any conditions save the facts themselves, and must be prepared to reconcile their subsequent differences not by appeals to force, covert or open, but by reference to some guiding principle on which there is common agreement.   V26 have proposed the principle of Government by the consent of the governed, and do not mean it as a mere phrase.    It is a simple expression of the test to which any proposed solution must respond if it is to prove adequatej and it can be used as a criterion for the details as well as for the whole.   That you claim it as a peculiarly British principle, instituted by Britain, and &quot;now the very life of the British Commonwealth&quot; should make it peculiarly acceptable to you.   On this basis and this only we see a hops of reconciling &quot;the Oonsiderations which must govern the attitude&quot; of Britain^ representatives with the oonsiderations that must govern the attitude of IrolandTsrepresentatives, and on this basis we are ready at once to appoint plenipotentiaries.I amSir*Faithfully yours,(Sgd.3 EAMOH BE VALERA.
