W 4This Document is the Property of His Britcmnic Majesty^ Government.For Official Use Only.Vol. IV., No. 7.    13.8.21.THE LABOUR SITUATIONWeek ending the 9th August, 1921.Prepared by Intelligence Division, Ministry of Labour.Contents.General Survey of the Week Features of the WeekPAGE69 70Negotiations and Disputes Statistical AppendixPAQfl73 76GENERAL  SURVEY OF THE WEEK.A general absence of notable events continues to be the predominant feature of the labour situation. The shipyard joiners&apos; dispute is still the one trade dispute of considerable magnitude in progress, while the steady decrease in recent weeks of the number of workers unemployed, as shown by the live register totals, continues. The increase, however, which followed the coal dispute has not yet disappeared. The estimated total of the Live Register of all Employment Exchanges on the 5th August was 1,738,300. This figure may be compared with 1,686,900, the corresponding figure for the 15th April at the end of the second week of the coal dispute.On the otherhand, there is a considerable stir of minor movements, none of which at the moment are very prominently in the public eye. In the strictly industrial sphere, the wages reduction movement proceeds in a somewhat underground and exceedingly complex fashion. The tendency towards disintegration, which was noticed last week, is observable this week also with the printing trade unions. Agri-cultural workers and Irish railwaymen are affected by legislation in progress or in prospect. No general results are yet discernible from the challenge the Labour Joint Committee of Inquiry have offered as regards the Labour Gazette cost-of-living index number.The extent to which the coal disputestill dominates the labour situation is shown by the attention which, it appears, will be paid at the annual meetings of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain and the Trades Union Congress to the working of trade union machinery at the time of crisis. Two projects on the part of trades unionists to break away from the wages system through the avenue of productive co-operation are reported below, and are of interest as evidence of the reaction upon the workers of present industrial movements.(34370-31) WU4-R5 300 8/21 H St. Gp.99
FEATURES  OF  THE  WEEK.General Topics.Corn Production Acts (Repeal) Bill-On the 3rd August the House of Lords gave a second reading to this Bill without a division. In Committee, on the 4th August, several amendments to Clause 4 were carried. It was decided to confine the powers of the conciliation committees to regulating wages and hours and to rule out &quot; conditions of employment.&quot; Sub-section (3), stating that a committee of employers and workmen might at any time appoint a new member of the committee in place of an existing member, was deleted. To Sub-section (4), previously Sub-section (5), which states that, when an agreement has been arrived at, an employer shall pay to a workman &quot; wages at not less than the rate payable under the agreement &quot; the follow-ing words were added :-&quot; Provided that wages shall not be recoverable under this sub-section unless proceedings for such recovery shall have been commenced before the expiration of three months after the date when the wages became due.&quot;At the end of Sub-section (5), previously Sub-section (6), the following words were added: , &quot; Provided that a workman shall not be entitled to recover arrears of wages at the rate agreed by the Committee except in respect of a period not exceeding six weeks next preceding -ing the commencement by the workman of proceedings for the recovery thereof.&quot;Sub-section (6), previously Sub-section (7), dealing with the appointment of an independent chairman &quot; with or without power to vote and with such other powers as the committee may determine,&quot; was amended to read as follows : &quot; A joint conciliation committee may appoint an independent person to act as chairman Avithont the power to vote.&quot;During the past week meetings of farmers at Hull, Norwich, and in Merioneth-;shire have adopted resolutions against the establishment of conciliation committees with compulsory powers.A gathering of agricultural workers at Driffield condemned the proposals for reduced wages, two others, in the Lewes district and at Cambridge, protested against the abolition of the Agricultural Wages Board, while at Wortham, Suffolk, and at Ashford. resolutions were passed criticising the agricultural policy of the Govern-ment.Wages ( Temporary Regulation) Acts 1918-1919. On behalf of a working managing foreman of a bakery a firm of solicitors have asked the Ministry for infor-mation concerning a claim for alleged arrears under these Acts. They have been informed that it is not now possible to take proceedings before a Munitions Tribunal.*The Cost of Living. There are signs that the publication of the final report of their investigations by the Labour Joint Committee on the cost of living, which was noticed in this Report last week, may be followed by some agitation amongst those workers whose wages are governed-by the Labour Gazette cost-of -living index number. The Daily Herald reports that the National Union of Railwaymen are being urged by several of their branches to test the accuracy of the official figures. Their contentions-tion is that the price of food-stuffs has actually increased, and some resolutions suggest an application on this ground for increased wages. A resolution is also reported from a branch of the Building Trade Workers&apos; Union, which mentions that butter, bacon, lard, milk, rent, coals and gas all show an advance in prices since the beginning of the year, and urges workers not to accept any further wages reductions based on &quot; sham cost-of-living figures.&quot;The Guild Movement. Two developments of the guild movement are reported. The first illustrates the progress being made towards the re-organisation of the Building Guild movement, which is the outcome of the national conference recently held in Manchester, t The second illustrates the popularity of the guild idea among all grades of workers and its occasional use as a means of combating wages reduction, but is otherwise of transient importance.The first of these developments is the first statutory meeting of the South Wales Regional Council of the Building Guild, held in Cardiff on the 2nd August. Reports on the contracts held by the sixteen constituent district committees were given, and it was decided to extend the scope of the Guild&apos;s activities in South Wales by entering the field of general property jobbing and repair work.* The firm were referred to the cases of Spencer v. Houghton and Eex v. Ellis, t See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 5, 30th July, p. 55.
The second is the setting up by operative tailors in Macclesiield of the &quot; Maccles-field Operative Tailors&apos; Guild.&quot; The guild is the outcome of a demand by the employers for a 25 per cent, reduction in wages. The workpeople offered to accept a 12J per cent, reduction, but this offer was refused. They have, therefore, taken work-shops and pooled their sewing machines and other instruments of their craft.Industrial and Other Organisations.Trades Union Congress. The annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress opens at Cardiff on the 5th September. In accordance with the decisions of last year&apos;s congress, a General Council will be elected on a group basis, in place of the Parlia-mentary Committee, and will have power -to promote common action by the whole trade union movement on general questions, such as wages and hours of labour.The agenda for the conference includes a discussion, on the initiative of the Building Trade Workers&apos; Union, on the &quot; apparent breakdown of the Triple Alliance in connexion with the miners&apos; dispute.&quot; This same dispute has, apparently, led also to an important resolution standing in the name of the Iron and Steel Trades Con-federation, which instructs the General Council to give attention to the consequences resulting from industrial strikes carried out on the present lines. It declares that these results make it imperative that adequate machinery should be provided through the Trades Union Congress so that, in the event of any serious dispute being likely to lead to a stoppage of work on a large scale, the power and influence of the labour movement may be brought to bear to obtain an equitable settlement of the dispute without stoppage of work, and, failing such a settlement, to guarantee that the machinery and resources of the movement generally may be co-ordinated and applied in such a way as to ensure a successful issue.The National Union of General Workers put forward a resolution on unem-ployment condemning the Government for their failure to take action either to diminish or prevent industrial dislocation and depression; protesting against large masses of unemployed being left idle when their services could be organised on produc-tive service of national benefit, and further condemning &quot; the inhuman treatment of the unemployed shown in the reductions of benefit under the Unemployment Insur-ance Act and in persistent refusals to meet reasonable claims for the maintenance of large masses of people wholly unable to secure employment.&quot;Other questions are raised on the Unemployment Insurance Act. There is a demand for its amendment in such a manner that an insured contributor who has lost his employment by reason of a trade dispute in which his union is not directly involved shall be entitled to out-of-work benefit. The Workers&apos; Union voice a demand that adequate representation shall be given to organised workers on com-mittees to be set up in connection with the Health and Unemployment Insurance Schemes; each committee to be given such powers as will enable them to exercise some voice in the management and control of the &quot; immense funds raised from the contributions of organised workers.&quot;A discussion will be initiated by the Building Trade Workers&apos; Union on the advisability of basing wages on a sliding scale definitely related to the cost of living as shown by the ofhcal index figure, and the Miners&apos; Federation will suggest that a National Congress be convened to consider the question of a minimum wage for all workers.A resolution protesting against the action of the Government in their attempt to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board and District Wages Committees is placed on the agenda by the National Union of Agricultural Workers.With regard to the administration of the Fair Wages resolution, the Tinplate, Sheet Metal Workers and Braziers&apos; Society advocate the establishment of a special contracting department, attached to the Ministry of Labour, which shall be respon-sible for the issue of all invitations to tender for Government work.With regard to hours of employment, two resolutions are worth notice. One. is in favour of a 44-hour working week for manual workers, and the other supports the seamen in their endeavour to secure inclusion in the Hours of Employment Bill.The Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union suggest that the General Council should make a serious inquiry into methods of investment and the inflation of capital, and also that the Congress should demand the appointment of a National Committee to investigate trade conditions in view of the evils of industrial interruption and trade dislocation caused by (a) changes in market rates and ex-changes, (6) disputes, (c) &quot; the sordid vagaries of international financiers and monopolists, trusts and trade combines.&quot;34370 k 2
* See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 6, 6th August, p. 64. f See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 6, 6th August, p. 65.Triple Alliance. It is expected that the future of the Triple Alliance will be discussed at the annual conference of the Miners&apos; Federation, at Llandudno, on the 17th August, and again at the Trades Union Congress in September. In the annual report of the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union, Mr. Ben Tillett puts forward interesting views on the collapse of the Alliance during the coal strike. His main criticism is directed against the dissension existing amongst members of the Miners&apos; Executive, which he claims stultified effective joint action. He suggests that the miners need an amalgamated union, and that the Miners&apos; Federation would be well advised to pool funds, machinery and resources in one great national organi-sation &quot; where there would be less of the reckless and irresponsible element to com-mand situations which may be pregnant with menace even to the safety of the community as well as to organised labour.&quot;.He foreshadows also the superseding of the Triple Alliance by the new General Council of the Trades Union Congress, which should have regard to &quot; all political movements of national and international moment.&quot;Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress. The Irish Trades Union Congress continued in session on the 3rd August.* It was resolved unanimously that the Congress should oppose everything in the nature of the partition of Ireland &quot; as destructive of the growing unity and strength of labour, and devised to prevent the Ulster workers from partaking of the fruits of the struggle of the Irish working class against capitalism and landlordism.&quot;A resolution was also passed protesting against the proposed wages reductions announced by the Irish railway companies. The possibility of a general strike against reductions in wages was discussed, and the president of the Congress, Mr. T. Foran, predicted that a great industrial upheaval would shortly take place in Ireland.Scottish Union of Dock Labourers.-At the resumed session of the annual conference of the Scottish Union of Dock Labourers,! it was resolved that the union should affiliate to the Labour Party. This decision cannot become operative until it has been submitted to a vote of the members.There was considerable discussion on a proposal to form a co-operative steve-doring society to be known as the Scottish Transport Workers&apos; Co-operative Steve-doring Society, to carry on the business of stevedoring and coaling and the distribu-tion of cargo at Glasgow Harbour and smaller ports. The resolution was remitted to the new Executive Council for further consideration, a report to be given to the next Congress.Association of Joint Industrial Councils and Interim Industrial Reconstruc-tion Committees. At a meeting of the Convening Committee, at Montagu House, on the 26th July, it was decided not to accept the offer of the Industrial League and Council to undertake the secretarial work of the association.It was decided to hold the next meeting of the association at Montagu House on the 20th September. The following decisions were made in connexion with the agenda of this meeting :-The Committee agreed to receive a deputation of Foremen&apos;s, Managers&apos; and Supervisory Associations on the subject of the relation of foremen to Whitley Councils.It was arranged that a resolution should be moved, by a member of the Hosiery Joint Council, in regard to the Ministry&apos;s attitude towards &quot; contracting out &quot; schemes under the Unemployment Insurance Acts. On the subject of compulsory powers, it was agreed to recommend the association to undertake further propaganda and to approach the Confederation of Employers and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress before communicating again with the Ministry of Labour.The Asbestos Council propose to- lay before the meeting of the 20th September their difficulties with the Admiralty with regard to the recognition of their rates under the Fair Wages Clause. A resolution will also be put before the meeting that the association support the Pottery Council in their effort to obtain for manufac-turers income tax rebatement in respect of money spent on structural alterations and additions to meet requirements of welfare work It was stated that the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer had promised to receive a deputation on this subject.
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Freestone Quarrying Workers, Yorkshire-It will be remembered that, at the annual meeting of the Yorkshire Area Joint Council for the Freestone Section of the Quarrying Industry, which was held at Brighouse on the 25th July, a difference of opinion occurred as to the interpretation of the sliding scale under Clause 4 of the local agreement. The matter has now been referred to the National Joint Council for the Freestone Section of the Quarrying Industry, who are to meet on the 10th August.Road Transport Workers (Manchester&apos;). It will be remembered that represen-tatives of the Amalgamated Horse and Motor Owners&apos; Association have been nego-tiating with the unions concerned, namely, the United Road Transport Workers&apos; Association of England and the United Vehicle Workers, on the question of a reduc-tion in wages * The employers have been compelled to negotiate with each union separately, as they refused to act jointly. On the 27th July, the employers met representatives of the United Road Transport Workers&apos; Association and submitted certain proposals, after which the meeting was adjourned for a fortnight. On the same day the employers had arranged to meet representatives of the United Vehicle Workers, but, when the meeting assembled, it transpired that the workpeople&apos;s side represented the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, of which federation the United Vehicle Workers are a constituent body. The employers called attention to this fact and stated that they expected to meet only the United Vehicle Workers. In reply, the workpeople&apos;^ representatives intimated that negotiations must be, con-ducted through the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation. After a discussion the meeting was adjourned on the understanding that the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation would write officially to the employers, and, in the meantime, the different employers&apos; associations have held meetings for the purpose of discussing the position.The employers have now arranged to meet representatives of the two unions, separately, on the 10th August, but, at the moment, they are not prepared to recognise the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation.Printing Employees (National). As recommended by the Joint Industrial Council for the Printing and Allied Trades, representatives of the Typographical Association, the Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Printers, the London Society of Compositors and the National Society of Electrotypers and Stereotypers and Assistants met, separately, representatives of the Federation of Master Printers and the Newspaper Society, in London on the 3rd August, to discuss the proposed wages reductions in the industry.! In each case the proposed reductions were resisted, and, as a result, the whole question is to be referred back to the Joint Industrial Council, a special meeting of which will be held at Montagu House on the 10th August.Meanwhile, a ballot is being taken by the London Society of Compositors on the question of acceptance or rejection of the wages reduction, coupled with that of pay-ing a special levy of 7s. fid. per week until the wage question be settled. The result of the ballot is to be made known at a mass meeting of delegates to be held on the 10th August.It is reported that the Printing Machine Managers&apos; Trade Society have with-drawn from the provisional settlement which was reached on the 25th July. They have thus taken,their stand with the other skilled unions, and it is reported that the Association of Correctors of the Press may take a similar step.Envelope and Manufactured Stationery Employees (National). It will be remembered that at a meeting of the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee for this industry, which was held on the 11th July, the employers put forward modified demands, which the trade union representatives agreed, to place before their executive.! A reply was received on the 26th July from the National Union of Printing and Paper Workers, which amounted to a rejection of the terms, the union claiming that the total demand should be reduced by 5s., in view of the fact that, on the 25th July, the printing&apos; trade employers reduced their corresponding demand&apos;* See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 5, 30th July, p. 56. t See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 5, 30th July, p. 57. X See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 4, 23rd July, p. 49.
Negotiations and Disputes continued.from 156&apos;. to 105.* The employers, however, were not prepared to accede to this request, and have posted notices to take effect this week, but it is probable that a further meeting with the workers&apos; representatives will take place before the fresh reduction becomes effective.Co-operative Employees (Northern Section). The threatened strike, of em-ployees of the retail co-operative societies attached to the Northern Section of the Co-operative Union has been averted. The point at issue was a demand by the societies, made in June last, that an advance of 10s. per week, conceded in November, 1920, should be withdrawn. On the 21st July, the decision of the societies was announced to put the reduction in force as from the 1st August. Steps were there-fore taken by the Chief Conciliation Officer, Newcastle, to bring the parties together, and eventually a meeting between the Joint Wages Council of the Northern Section of the Co-operative Union and the divisional council of the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers was held on the 1st August. The conference lasted for over six hours, but no settlement on the wages question was reached. Both parties agreed to refer the matter to arbitration.Co-operative Employees (Scotland). A conference of branch delegates of the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers was held on the 3rd August to consider the proposal made by the Scottish Co-operative Wages Board to modify Sheriff Fyfe&apos;s award dated the 17th February, t The following resolution was adopted unanimously : &quot; That this National Conference of representatives of the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers of Scotland cannot see its way to agree to the proposal to modify Sheriff Fyfe&apos;s award before December 31st, 1921. Further, we remind the co-operative movement that yearly agreements have been in operation for a number of years and have been loyally kept by the union in spite of sharp rises in the cost of living during the years 1914 to 1920, and particularly during 1920. We also remind the co-operative movement that the Wages Board pressed for abitration and nominated Sheriff Fyfe as arbiter and they have signed an agreement to carry out in full the award which was made operative and binding on both parties from January 1st to December 31st, 1921.&quot; ,Settlements and Agreements.Building Trade Employees (Cornwall). At a meeting of the Cornwall County Building and Allied Trades Employers&apos; Association, held on the 9th July, it was decided that from the 6th August the rates of wages were to be Is. fid. per hour for tradesmen and Is. 2d. for labourers, the new rates representing a reduction of 2d. per hour. As from this date, the wages are to be regulated on a sliding scale, which provides for a reduction of Id. per hour for every decrease of 14 points in the cost-of-living index number, the scale to be based on the June figure of 119. It is provided that no reduction under the sliding scale shall take place until four clear weeks from the 6th August have elapsed.Street Masons and Paviors (Leeds). In March last an agreement was reached between the Leeds Corporation and the National Amalgamated Operative Street Masons, Paviors and Road Makers Society of Great Britain and Ireland, in which a definite rate of 2s. 2d. per hour, to come into operation for three months, was fixed. The agreement was due to expire on the 31st July, but, prior to this, a meeting of the parties was held and it was decided to apply the building trade craftsmen&apos;s rates to the street masons and paviors as from the 1st August. The rate, therefore, is now 2s. Id. per hour, and from the 1st September will be 2s. 0^d. per hour, but the paviors are to work 47 hours per week and not 44 hours as in the building trade.Railway Shopmen (National). A meeting was held in London on the 9th August between the Negotiating Committee of Railway General Managers, on the one hand, and representatives of the National Union of Railwaymen, the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, and the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives, on the other, to consider the wages and.working conditions of skilled craftsmen employed in railway engineering shops. As a result, it was agreed that a reduction of 6s. per week should operate for railway shopmen from the 15th August. It was further agreed that the Negotiating Committee of Railway General Managers should recommend to the railway companies that other matters in dispute,, including overtime, night-shift, and district rates, should be referred to arbitration.* See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 5, 30th July, p. 57. t See this Report Vol. IV, No. 3, 16th July, p. 41.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued,The Amalgamated Engineering Union, however, declined to be represented at the conference on the ground that they do not &quot; recognise the right of the National Union of Railwaymen to negotiate on behalf of the shopmen.&quot; It is reported that the policy of the Amalgamated Engineering Union is to negotiate directly and inde-pendently with the railway companies, and negotiations with the Great Central Rail-way Company are stated to be complete.Coal Tippers (National). A conference was held in London on the 4th August between representatives of the dock owners and railway companies, on the one hand, and representatives of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation and the National Union of Railwayinen, on the other, when the employers&apos; proposals to reduce the wages of coal tippers were discussed.*After a protracted session, it was announced that a temporary settlement, to operate until December, had been arrived at, providing for a gradual reduction, spread over a period, of the existing 50 per cent, on pre-war earnings, which-is now an addition to the minimum wage. At the end of the period of the temporary agree-ment a tariff on a permanent basis is to be arranged.Co-operative Transport Workers (South Yorkshire). Following negotiations between the South Yorkshire Hours and Wages Board of the Co-operative Societies, the United Road Transport Workers&apos; Association of England and the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers, an agreement, affecting 300 to 400 workers, was reached at a joint conference, held on the 4th August, by which the wages of trans-port workers employed by the societies are to be reduced by 55. per week, the reduction to take effect on the first pay day in August.* See this Report Vol. Ill, No. 26, 25th June, p. 516.
