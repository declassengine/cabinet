C RET.- CABINET,3242 *&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;    &quot; THE ARMS TRAFFIC CONVENTION,Memorandum by Mr. Fisher.I desire to bring to the notice of my Colleagues the obligations which the British Empire was recently and Is still, I hope, disposed to undertake with respect to the Control of the Trade in Arms and Ammunition under the Convention which wes signed at St.&apos; Germain on September 10th, 1919.   Under Article   6 of this Convention the High Contracting Parties undertake, each as far as the territory under its jurisdiction Is concerned, to prohibit the importation of arms and ammuni-tion into the following territorial areas, and also to prevent their importation and transportation in the maritime zone defined below:-1.    The whole of the Continent of Africa with the exception of Algeria, Libya and the Union of South Africa.Within this area are included ail islands situated within a hundred nautical miles of the coast, together-with PrinceVs Island,. St. Thomas Island and the Islands of Armobon 1 and Socotra. !2.    Transcaucasia, Persia, Gwadar, the Arabian Peninsula andsuch continental parts of Asia as were Included In the turkish empire on August 4th, 1914. c3.    A maritime zone, including the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman, and bounded by a line drawn from Cap     Guardafui, following&apos; the latitude of that Cape to its intersection with longitude 57Q east of Greenwich and proceeding thence direct to the eastern frontier of Persia in the Gulf of Oman.This Convention was&apos;signed by Mr. Balfour, on behalf of the British Empire, and was also signed by the United States of America, by France, Italy, Japan, Greece, Belgium and  by    16 other States.DOCUMENT&apos;IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).&quot;
It will be seen that the main purpose of this instru-ment is not to promote disarmament as among civilised Govern-ments but to prevent munitions of war from passing into the hands of barbarous or half-civilised races.I wish to ask the Cabinet what line the British representatives at the League of Nations should take with respect to the ratification of this document.The position with regard to the ratification of the convention is profoundly unsatisfactory.    It appears, from recent Inquiries made by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, that the only States which have actiially ratified the Convention are Chile, China, Greece and Siamc   Ro\imania has decided to ratify and the Netherlands and Finland have expressed their willingness to adhere.   None of the principal Allied and Associated Towers have yet ratified and it is obvious that until they do so no acceptance by the smaller States can have a decisive influence oh the Arms Traffic.    The United States was one cf the signatories of the Convention of St. Germain, but so far as we can learn the Convention    &apos;has not yet been.submitted to the Senate for ratification.   I believe that the existing legislation of the United States does not enable the export of Arms, except to certain limited areas, to be controlled and I cannot estimate the diffi-culties of obtaining the necessary legislative authority for this purpose.   It is clear, however, that unless steps can be taken to bring under control the American Traffic in Arms either through the control of export by the United States Government or, alternatively, by the control of its import Into other parts of the World, the Convention of St. Germain is bound to remain inoperative since any attempted control of the Arras Traffic by the other States would, merely result in transferring the source of supply to the armaments firms of America.
The Assembly of the League of Nations at Its last Meeting passed a Resolution to the effect that it was desira-tole that the Signatory Po-vers should proceed without d^lay to ratification.    The Mixed Commission on Armaments appointed by the Council of the League will undoiibtedly report in the same sense next September and as I am a member of that Commission I&apos;should like to be authorised to say that the British Govern-ment would proceed to ratification as soon as the other principal Allied and Associated Powers are prepared to ratify..   I cannot conceive that any inconvenience would attach to such a declaration and it might do good.    I would also suggest that the British Government should raise the question with the American Government at the approaching Conference at Washington^.Meanwhile, It should be observed that it is contrary to the express terms- of tho Convention of St. Germain that Arms and Ammunition should be exported from the territories of the High Contracting Parties to such continental parts of Asia as were included in.the Turkish Empire on August 4th, 1914*The British Empire, having so far withheld ratification, is  certainly under no legal obligation (differing in this regard from Greece) to respect this provision, but the Con-vention of St.. Germain is based upon such clear principles of right reason and humanity, and points to so substantial an improvement in international law that I&apos;trust&quot; that the vrhole weight of British influence will he exerted to procure a general ratification of the Treaty.(Sgd.)
