[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]I was unfortunately not able-to be at the Cabinet on Tuesday morning, and therefore 1 trust that the Cabinet will find time to read a short Note, the object of which is to urge that before we separate for the holidays we should have another discussion on our financial machinery with a view to the further elucidation of a situation, which seems, to me, at least perplexing.When I heard on Tuesday that the Cabinet had resolved that there should be a Committee appointed - to investigate departmental expenditure over which the Prime Minister was proposing that Sir Eric geddes should preside, it struck me as most admirable. There have been such enquiries into departmental expenditure before. There were some, it&apos; 1 remember rightly, in Mr. Asquith&apos;s Government in which various Cabinet Ministers were invited to investigate, with assistance, certain aspects at least of the expenditure of particular departments. If there is any one man who can find time to conduct an investigation into expenditure in all departments, this is a further improvement upon the machinery then used. My recollection of it is, perhaps, imperfect.But I did net gather at that time that the Committee was to be publicly announced and become such an important subject of political discussion. I did not understand that it was expected that such a Committee would pave the way for large reductions of expenditure. It never occurred to me that we were not to receive at present the proposals which the Prime Minister at a recent Cabinet stated he was going to lay before us ; and I am therefore left in perplexity as to what the terms of reference to the Committee are going to be, what exactly are its functions, its scope and its powers. I see it stated on the one hand that the Committee is going to make recommendations as to policy, either directly or indirectly, and is going to advise the Government as to the abandonment of particular functions or services. This is surely incredible. Apart from any of the constitutional objections which have been voiced in various newspapers and interviews, and which appear to me on this incredible hypothesis to be very real, I understand that the Committee is to consist of business men. But policy is either Military, or Naval, or Political. Can it be right, or wise, or thinkable that a Committee of business men should tell us whether capital ships are good or bad thingv; whether we ought, or ought not, to retain a-vmandate for Mesopotamia or Palestine ; whether we should, or should not, substitute air squadrons for cavalry squadrons, or how many infantry battalions are necessary in Ireland, or what is the most economical method of tackling -tuberculosis? I therefore dismiss this theory as unauthorised and impossible ; but in the alternative i see it stated that the Committee of business men is going to tell us what particular services cost so that then the Cabinet may&apos; be in a position to decide what services should be sacrificed. But if this be so, do we really want a Committee for this purpose ? We know to a penny the cost of Mesopotamia; our own accounting officers can tell us how much is spent on fighting tuberculosis, or what reduction there would be if we had no troops in Silesia. Again, it is stated that the Committee is going to suggest to us how money could be saved in the proper discharge of the existing liabilities of the Government; whether, for instance, we could fight tuberculosis by the existing methods on a cheaper scale; whether money is wasted in bringing home or in sending out drafts for Mesopotamia ; whether inland water transport in Mesopotamia, could be better done by private enterprise, and so on. This is what, when I first heard of it, I thought the Committee were going to do. 1 have always been of the impression that if somebody had time to investigate the internal economy of Government Departments from time to time, a certain amount of public money would be saved, and 1 think this work might well be discharged for the Cabinet by such a Committee. But I do not believe, though I hope I am wrong, that the saving will amount to many millions sterling if this is the scope of the Committee, and I am very much afraid that if this is all that the Committee has to do, the public advertisement which it has received will make it appear to be a Committee only for avoiding the retrenchment upon which the public is said to have set its heart..  4483     joo 8.21Printed for the Cabinet   A lujust 1921.CABINET.THE FINANCIAL POSITION. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.
so far i may perhaps have asked questions and expressed misgivings-on subjects that are clear to my colleagues who were present at tuesday^ cabinet. but my perplexities are not removed by reading the conclusions of the cabinet, for i notice from them that the committee arc to have regard especially to the present and prospective position of the revenue. i should have thought that the present and prospective position of the revenue was a matter upon, which the treasury and its ollicials could advise the cabinet, unless the phrase means that the committee is to suggest what in the present financial stringency it is most advisable to give up which again is a political question.the fact of the matter is, in my view, that the government is likely to be confronted with a very difficult political&quot; situation if it believes that the country is really interested in economy and expenditure. the country is only interested in economy and expenditure if by means of this economy there can be a reduction of taxation. if it be found that all this talk of waste and anti-waste and economy ends in a deficit which must be met by new taxation or even in the maintenance of taxation at its present, level, wc shall have gained no new political strength from all the steps that we have taken and arc taking; on the contrary, the dis-appointment will be all the greater because of the irritation of those who have been forced to abandon projects, on which they had set their hearts, without receiving as a result any improvement in the financial position of the country as realised in a lightening of the burden of taxation.1 can see no course open to us but to look for retrenchment in matters of high, policy, to look for a saving in largo sums of money by setting ourselves to the abandonment of things which, we cannot afford. notwithstanding our pledges in mesopotamia and in palestine, for instance, wo could accomplish much by abandoning these two countries. it would be on the whole comparable to the cessation for the time being of our housing policy or to the complete reversal of our agricultural policy despite election promises and the earlier policy of our administration. these steps were justified by the fact that we could not afford it. the inevitable change dictated by stern necessity in home policy could well be accompanied by a similar change in foreign policy. or again we might save money by a considerable reduction in the emoluments or pensions of the naval and. military servants of the crown, or preferably of all those in public employment, to meet the new standard of life which after-war conditions perhaps makes necessary. but these are questions of policy for ministers. i am not quite clear that the work of sir eric geddcs&apos; committee will facilitate their consideration, and they should, it seems to me, be considered at a very early date.the truth of the mutter is, 1 venture to submit, that our government machinery requires reconsideration in view of existing circumstances. i cannot persuade myself that the government lias sufficient time or apparatus for reviews of policy. there is no.general staff to the government. the cabinet is absorbed in. taking day-to-day decisions without having an opportunity of piecing them together. i had hoped at.one time, and.in tin; earlier history of the government there was reason to hope, that the finance. committee of tin; cabinet might undertake this work. but from whatever cause it does not so function; perhaps it is not the right body. it is&apos; called together like the cabinet itself to consider the financial aspects of particular questions ; to come suddenly at a meeting to a decision on the housing policy of the government or on the desirability of raising a loan. but a finance committee to be really of service to the chancellor of the exchequer and the government should, it seems to me, be constantly silting under the chancellors chairmanship at the treasury to take stock of the financial position as it changes from time to time; to be familiar with the bearing of one financial aspect of policy upon another in order that its advice may be well, informed and properly correlated.1 would also submit that if the grouping of offices, which has so often been suggested, could be brought about, many questions would be removed from cabinet discussion, and the cabinet would have time itself to investigate and lay down the lilies of policy. although, therefore, 1. do hope that the committee which has been decided upon will have defined functions which may be valuable, i venture to suggest that the reduction of taxation which 1 think is necessary can only be achieved by a well-ordered consideration by ministers of policy as a whole on the advice of a properly instructed finance committee, and that it is to a revision of the machinery of government rather than to outside bodies that we can. best look for a method of producing substantial alterations in the financial position of the country.4th august 1921. e. s. m.
