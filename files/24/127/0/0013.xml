[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1921.SECRET. cp. 3213PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE situation in Palestine causes me perplexity and anxiety. The whole country is in a ferment. The Zionist policy is profoundly unpopular with all except the Zionists. Both Arabs and Jews are armed and arming, ready to spring at each other&apos;s throats. The Emir Abdullah has done his best to keep order in Trans-Jordania, but, of course, he has no troops or organised force at his disposal. There&apos; are many dangerous elements in Trans-Jordania.In the interests of the Zionist policy, all elective institutions have so far been refused to the Arabs, and they naturally contrast their treatment with that of their fellows in Mesopotamia.The present strength of the Imperial garrison is about 8,000 men; and so far from this garrison being reduced, I am more likely to be confronted with demands for increasing it. The War Office estimates for this garrison during the coming financial year 1922-23 are , 3,319,000, including expenditure on works and land. It cannot be doubted that this expense is almost wholly due to our Zionist policy.Meanwhile, Dr. Weizmann and the Zionists are extremely dis-contented at the progress made, at the lukewarm attitude of the British officials, at the chilling disapprobation of the military, and at the alleged weakening of Sir Herbert Samuel.It seems to me that the whole situation should be reviewed by the Cabinet.  I have done and am doing my best to give effect to the[6754]
pledge given to the Zionists by Mr. Balfour on behalf of the War Cabinet and by the Prime Minister at the San Remo Conference. I am prepared to continue in this course, if it is the settled resolve of the Cabinet.I append a Memorandum which has been prepared by my direction in the Middle Eastern Department of the Colonial Office.w. s. c.Colonial Office,August 11, 1921..
(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,] SECRET.PALESTINE.THE presence in this country of a Moslem Christian delegation from Palestine; the necessity for drafting an instrument providing for the constitution of that country in the near future; and the recent representations made to the Prime Minister by Dr. Weizmann, the leader of the Zionist organisation, make it desirable that the position in Palestine should be briefly reviewed.In the month of May there were serious disturbances at Jaffa between Jewish and Arab elements, followed by attacks made by Arabs on Jewish colonies. The High Commissioner appears to have been taken somewhat by surprise by these events, and to have realized for the first time that a certain proportion of the ten thousand Jews who have entered the country during the past year were undesirable characters, tainted with Bolshevism. He also appears to have received reports on the lines of a military intelligence report which has already been circulated to the Cabinet, which led him to the conclusion that the anti-Jewish disturbances were organised and premeditated, and that the country was in a thoroughly dangerous state. He accordingly suspended immigration, and at the same time let it be generally known in Palestine that he would make a statement of policy on the occasion of the King&apos;s birthday celebrations on the 3rd June. The form which this statement should take was discussed in detail with the Secretary of State, and the result - was that on that occasion Sir Herbert Samuel announced that immigration would be resumed under more stringent conditions ; that the scheme for raising a defence force in Palestine, which should contain Jewish and Arab companies, was postponed for the time being ; that in its place a mixed gendarmerie would be added to the existing police force; that the question of ensuring a free and authoritative expression of popular opinion was receiving the closest attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government in London; and that on the coming into force of the mandate it was intended by His Majesty&apos;s Government to make provision for the Government of Palestine in an instrument which would be registered with the Council of the League of Nations.At the same time Sir Herbert Samuel defined the meaning of the Balfour Declaration in the following words: &quot; They mean that the Jews, a people who are scattered throughout the world, but whose hearts are always turned to Palestine, should be enabled to found here their home, and that some among them, within the limits which are fixed by the numbers and interests of the present population, should come to Palestine in order to help by their resources and efforts to develop the country to the advantage of all its inhabitants.&quot;^reat exception has been taken in Zionist circles to this last utterance, which is n.3g-.rded as a negation, of. the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. In nprj Jewish quarters in Palestine it is regarded as a victory, and the delegation, which is now in London, announced their intention before leaving Palestine of endeavouring to secure the total abandonment by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the Zionist policy.The section of the report of the Commission of Enquiry, presided over by the Chief Justice of Palestine, which deals with Arab attacks on Jewish colonies has now been received. The report concludes with a statement that the evidence and the probabilities are against the allegations advanced by the colonists that the attack was premeditated and prearranged. At the same time it cannot be doubted that there is a wide-spread feeling of apprehension among the non-Jewish inhabitants of Palestine at the prospect of being placed against their will under Jewish rule. None of them can point to a single instance of an Arab being unfairly treated in favour of a Jew during the period of British administration. It is the policy itself to which they object, and it is only by proceeding cautiously and proving to them that Jewish immigration will not entail any deprivation of their existing rights and privileges that the Zionist policy can[6754 a]
be made a success. It is assumed that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no intention of departing from their Zionist policy. The problem which has to be worked out now is one of tactics, not strategy, the general strategic idea being the gradual immigration of Jews into Palestine to the extent to which they can be absorbed into the economic life of the country without detriment to the rights and privileges of the non-Jewish majority.A recent statement made by Dr. Weizmann that the language employed by Sir H. Samuel in his statement of policy (and subsequently quoted by the Secretary of State in Parliament) is wholly irreconcilable with the terms of the Balfour Declaration and with the interpretation which has by common consent been placed upon them from first to last, is open to question. He appears also to be unduly apprehensive at the proposal that representative institutions in some form should be established forthwith. On the other hand he makes out a good caseior the adoption of certain measures &quot;to ensure that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government shall be resolutely carried out.The first essential is to establish public security on such a basis that the High Commissioner is in a position to enforce his authority. The present position is anomalous. The troops in Palestine form part of the Egyptian command, and Sir H. Samuel has not the benefit of personal contact with their superior commander. It has been repeatedly pointed out by the War Office that Palestine is of no military value from an Imperial point of view. It should be regarded as an entirely separate administration, and the troops in the country should be entirely at the disposal of the civil power. It is not fair to the High Commissioner to expect him to exercise the necessary control if his troops are at the disposal of a Commander-in-chief who is not even in the country. There is no real connection, whether political or military, between Egypt and Palestine, and the brigade in the latter country should, in my opinion, be placed directly under the War Office without delay.Secondly, in order to ensure that every effort is made to bring the Zionist experiment to a successful issue, any officials, whether civil or military, who are publicly and confessedly opposed to the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should be replaced. Recommendations are expected from the High Commissioner in the course of the next few weeks as to the civil officials who shall be placed permanently upon a pensionable establishment in Palestine. This will afford an opportunity of releasing any members of the Administration who do not feel that they can conscientiously carry out what some of them regard as- an unfair and unpopular measure.Thirdly, the Jewish colonies should be adequately protected from the wanton attacks of their Arab neighbours. It is an open secret that they are arming themselves in an irregular manner. This cannot be permitted. The Jewish colonists should be embodied in an official reserve to the existing police, and it should be explained to the Arabs that they will not be called out except in the event of unprovoked aggression, in which case the whole force of the Government will be behind them.Fourthly, strong measures must be taken to punish the villages responsible for the recent attacks. It is a negation of all government that inoffensive villages, whatever may be their political or religious views, should be subject to violent aggression by their neighbours, and that the aggressors should go unpunished. Temporary reinforcements from Egypt or elsewhere sherd? i. be unhesitatingly demanded if this proves necessary, but it is hoped that Sh&apos; H. Samuel will be able to take the necessary steps without calling for further military&apos; assistance.Fifthly, more reliance should be placed upon the Zionist Organisation as a recommending authority for immigrants. Sir H. Samuel reports that of the 10,000 Jews who have arrived in the country during the past year only some 3,000 were admitted under the auspices of the Zionist Organisation. It is not fair to saddle the Organisation with the responsibility for immigrants whom they have not selected.Lastly, early steps should be taken for the granting to Jewish enterprise of economic concessions for works of public utility which do not conflict with pre-war claims, of which the disposal must necessarily await the legalisation of our position as mandatory in Palestine. Two of these concessions are now being considered in London, both of them containing expropriation clauses in the event of owners of land refusing to part with their property at reasonable rates. This cannot be regarded as conflicting in any way with the second clause of the Balfour
Declaration, which was clearly not intended to protect individuals who are determined to thwart the execution of the main policy.Concurrently with the measures suggested above, steps should be taken for the establishment of Sir Herbert SanmeTs Advisory Council on an elected basis. The arguments of non-elected bodies cannot be indefinitely ignored on the ground that they are not representative, while at the same time objection is taken to the setting up of a really representative body. It should not be impossible to work out a scheme by which the Advisory Council shall be precluded from obstructing the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, while they remain free to express their legitimate views on all proposals for the economic development of the country.It is submitted that if these suggestions are approved, the High Commissioner should be informed of the line which His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to take, and asked if he is prepared with the means at his disposal to put into execution the measures outlined above./
