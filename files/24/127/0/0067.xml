[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   August 192.1.SECRET.C P. 3 2.6 6&quot;CABINET. MOPLAH  RIOTS.I circulate to my colleagues the following telegrams which have been received -from the Viceroy on the subject of the Mop!ah riots.E. S. M.2Gt.li August 1921.From Viceroy, Hlfme Department, 22nd Augusk 1921.Priority A. *:Following telegram has been received from Madras : &quot; Troops and police who were assisting District Magistrate at Malabar in making-arrests of dangerous leaders under Moplah. Outrages Act, have been heavily attacked by armed bodies of Moplahs at Tirurangadi. Casualties reported so far, one officer of Leinster. Regiment, and Assistant Superintendent of E&apos;olice, and two constables missing. Railway stations at Parapandi and Kadalundi attacked- and looted, also post offices at former place and at Tanur. Arrangements made, with General Officer Commanding to send necessary reinforcements. Troops and police at Tirurangadi, and also detachment of Leinster Regiment at Malapuram, are apparently on the defensive with communications cut.&quot;Further information will be sent when received.From Viceroy, Home Department, 2-Rn August 1921. Clear the line.Continuation of telegram of 22nd August. Moplah riots. Following further telegrams from Madras :- -&quot; District Magistrate reports that information has been received that a mob of 10,000 men at Tirur captured two soldiers, one European, also sub-magistrate and police inspector.   The fate of these men is unknown.   Office burnt.&quot;&quot; 2. A report from the District Magistrate from Kadajzi states that he has abandoned Tirurangadi. The Government of Madras presume, therefore, that he is withdrawing to Calicut. Be asks that the military should now take charge as the situation is- beyond civil control. The report from the sub-division magistrate at Malapuram states that he is holding MaJapuram with 30 of the Leinster Regiment and 20 special police. He has been called upon for help from Manjeri and cannot send assistance owing to his limited force. The sub-division magistrate at Palghat reports that the railway is damaged at several places west of Shoranur, and both magistrates report that the road and telegraphic communications are interrupted owing to the felled trees and cut wires. At the request of the General Officer Commanding we have sanctioned the introduction of the railway security scheme west of Podanur, and are satisfied, from the reports received, that a state of open rebellion exists, and that martial law should be established in the Taluks of Ponnani, Ernad and Walluvanad. We are of opinion that conditions now correspond to state of affairs described in chapter 2 of the Martial Law Manual, and that regular action, as contemplated in chapter 3 of the Manual, should be taken. It is therefore suggested that martial law be introduced by Ordinance by the Oovemor-General.&quot;&quot; 3. Malabar. Continuation of my telegram of the 22nd August. On receipt of message from District Magistrate that situation is critical at Calicut, that women and children had been evacuated to barracks, and asking for ship of war. to be sent as quickly as possible to Calicut with supplies, this Government communicated with Naval Commander-in-Chief, Colombo, who intimates departure for Calicut this 4550      100   S.21
morning of H.M.S. Comus, to be followed by H.M.S. Espiegle, if required. District Magistrate to-day reports Calicut surrounded on all sides except north, and expects rising in town if Moplahs enter from outside.&quot; In the circumstances, Ordinance should apply martial ,law to Calicut Taluks also. Police Inspector, Walluvanad, telegraphs two police than as attacked, carbines taken and records burnt.&quot;We also repeat two military reports below : &quot;The following is the situation report for 20 hours on 21st August. In Ernad&quot; and Noonnani Taluks the Moplahs have broken out in revolt and there have been several affrays. The chril authorities have handed over control to the military ; the military force sent from Calicut to help them in searching for arms is withdrawing to&quot; Calicut.   The line lias been cut between Tirur and Beypore at several points.&quot; To-morrow, 22nd August, the 2nd Dorsetshire Regiment will move from Bangalore to Poaanpnr; a squadron of the Queen&apos;s Bays and a section of Field Artillery will follow them. I have put Colonel Humphreys of the Leinster Regiment in command of the military forces in Malabar; his forces will, in the first instance, be based on Podanur.&quot; It is possible that more British infantry will be wanted. The Madras Government have given me a free hand and I have informed Headquarters, Southern Command, accordingly.&quot;&quot; The following is a report of the arrival at 6 p.m. on 22nd August. The column sent to Tirurangadi from Calicut has returned to the latter place with no additional casualties. There is, as yet, no further news of the detachment of Malapuram. Colonel Humphreys reached Podanur to-day and on 23rd he will execute a recon-naissance together with the Inspector-General of Police. The concentration of the force which is being sent to Podanur should be completed by noon to-morrow (23rd).&quot; It is reported that the Moplahs are collected in strength at Tirurston and are doing damage to Palliburan railway bridge and taking up the rails to the west of it. Calicut is reported quiet so far, but trouble is expected there.&quot;More follows.From Viceroy, Home Department, 24 7j August 1921. Clear the line.Continuation of our telegram of to-day&apos;s date regarding Moplah riots.   Letter from Madras of 18th, regarding expected visit of Mahomed Ali, throws further light on predisposing causes of outbreak.   Situation in Malabar caused anxiety from June last.   Reports received that local Khilafat agitators enrolling volunteers dressed in uniform with swords, but subsequently reported that leaders had recognised dangerous consequences of such action and had desisted, and movement seemed to be dying out. More recent events show (? that, omitted) lenient view taken by authorities only served to make agitators conceal organisation, which they secretly strengthened.   In course of search of Mopilla suspected of. housebreaking, police inspector threatened Avith violence, and large crowd gathered, armed with swords, knives and spears, on 31st July and 1st August.   Shortly afterwards Moplahs&apos; picketted toddy shops and assaulted tappers and broke pots.   Case registered, but accused protected from arrest by armed mob.    In view of ferment created, Government applied to military authorities for more support, and strength of British troops accordingly raised to full company.   Viceroy returned to Simla from Naini Tal yesterday.   Situation discussed in Council last night.   We have wired to Madras, summarising Ordinance prepared for such an emergency, and communicated to you in Despatch No. 4, dated 31st March, and asking what portions of it required.   We added : &quot; Government of India consider in particular that special tribunals and summary general courts-martial are unnecessary, and that summary courts, to which civil magistrates only wTould be appointed, should suffice.   Cases not triable by summary courts to be tried by ordinary criminal courts (? inverted commas end).   It has been suggested that it is preferable to continue dealing with situation by means of de facto martial law, now apparently in force without any Ordinance, the operations of military being confined to suppression of disorder and disposal (sic ? dispersal) of unlawful assemblies.   Feel strongly, however, that Ordinance is the only satisfactory method of (1) validating proceedings of summary courts; (2) providing for legal method of punishing acts which, though not offences against ordinary law, are breaphes of martial law, regula-tions and orders, and incompatible with maintenance of order; (3)  preventing
/irregular or improper punishments for breaches of military rules ; (4) for indemnifying &apos; officers for acts done in good faith and in reasonable belief that they are necessary for performance of their duty.Whether Ordinance is promulgated or not, special orders must be issued for military to consult, and keep in closest touch with, civil authorities. It is presumed that all officers, civil or military, will observe martial-law instructions recently issued. Necessary orders to secure both these ends will be issued to military officers by Ooinmander-in-Chief. Further, Government of India consider it essential that trials and punishments should be left as little as possible in hands of military officers, and, as suggested above, civil officers alone should be vested with these powers. Please communicate your views clear the line, when necessary action will be taken.The following was Order in Council: &quot;That a telegram be sent to Madras Government explaining the terms of martial-law Ordinance prepared by Government of India last winter, but suggesting that it should be amended in following particulars : -(1) The powers of summary courts to be vested in civil magistrates only. (2) The persons accused before summary courts to have the right of being defended- by a counsel. That the Madras Government be asked which portions of the draft Ordinance they consider should be included in the Ordinance now proposed. The Government of India consider, in particular, that special tribunals and summary general courts martial are unnecessary, and that summary courts, to which civil magistrates only would be appointed, should suffice ; cases not triable by summary courts to be tried by ordinary criminal courts. That the argument for and against martial-law. Ordinance be put to the Madras Government, together with an expression of opinion on the part of the Government of India that the martial-law Ordinance is preferable, for various reasons, to the continuance of de facto martial law.&quot; That the Madras Government be informed that, whether Ordinance is promulgate (? ed omitted) or not, special orders must bo issued for military to consult and to keep in closest touch with civil authorities, and that the necessity of observing the martial-law instructions recently issued be impressed on all officers, civil and military. The Government of India consider it essential that trials and punishments should be left as little as possible in the hands of military officers.&quot;From Viceroy, Home Department, 24tth August 192.1.Continuation of our telegram of this morning, following substance of Press report : Mob moving towards Pattambi, Ottapalam and Ponnani. Post and telegraph office at Ponnani reported almost pillaged, and looting in Nilambur, Manjeri, Malapuram, Tirur, Farapanagadi and other places, where from (sic) innocent men, women and children fleeing for lives.

Internal security scheme has been enforced. Administrative arrangements and measures taken for railway security are working smoothly and satisfactorily.&quot; As regards Malapuram there is no further news. I hope, however, to establish a base to-morrow, 24th, sufficiently far forward to launch a column to relieve the place.&quot;From Viceroy, Home Department, 25th August 1921. Following communique issued by Madras Government: &quot; 24th August 1921. Military operations in connection with disturbances in Malabar are progressing satisfactorily. Following telegraphic report dated 23rd August 1921, received from District Magistrate, Calicut, is published for general information : &apos; Following complete resume events since Friday night. Contemplated surprise Tirurangadi successful as a surprise, but unsuccessful as regards arrests ; only three men arrested out of those wanted, with one war knife. Searches ceased about 10. Town then quiet. Twenty-five reserve men left (? to) continue search for absconding warrantees. It is clear that news of our action sent out round country side. At quarter to 12 news came that crowd of. 2,000 Mopilla from Tanur come by train to Parappanangadi and other places on west advancing on us. At noon police, and myself went out to meet and disperse them, supported by troops. Contact made 12.30. Mob, when called to disperse, advanced steadily; police charged with fixed bayonets and were met with sticks. In self-defence firing-began from front rank with nine known casualties. Crowd partly yielded, partly dispersed to Perambas on both flanks. Lancaster, A.S.P., struck with club. Without further firing, police pushed crowd back slowly to (? one) side from Parap-panangadi and returned with 40 prisoners. At 15 hours I learnt then that crowd, estimated 2,000, drove in Tirurangadi police party and attacked platoon Leinsters guarding camp. Dispersed with Lewis guns and magazine fire. Rowley was with this party. Not known how Rowley and Johnstone of Leinsters became separated from men. After much needed meal we-were preparing search for them when, after 17 hours, news came that bodies and Head Constable&apos;s body lying by road near camp. Bodies recovered hours 17.30. Bodies terribly mutilated and hacked. Returned camp and prepared defence for night. Anticipating attack from 2,000 men reported assembled in Mosque ; 19 hours, Deputy Tahsilclar reported from Para-panagadi that railway station and post office sacked and line cut. About 19 hours handed over situation to Officer Commanding as on (? now) beyond civil powers. Unexpectedly night was peaceful on Sunday. At 8.30 hours, after burying our dead, marched back to Parappanangadi. It was impossible to remain without rations or communications in face vastly superior numbers. Arrived along railway for Kadalundi beating off several attacks on both flanks, front and rear, during first three miles. Line had been cut three places, intention obviously being to isolate column, . which arrived at Kadulundi 17 hours. Learnt line being cut near Chalier Bridge and tried to intercept and came too late, and therefore marched to Feroke. Arrived 20 hours. : Line cut Calicut side, Feroke Bridge being then under repair. Train awaiting. Entrained about 22 hours, arrived Calicut midnight. Had column not returned, most. probably Calicut would have been looted. Monday morning required Officer Commanding take charge Calicut for sufficient reasons.   Line repairs proceeded with...
Situation now as follows : Known that Malapuram detachment isolated ; line cut to Kuttiputam, perhaps beyond; road blocked ; bridges broken from tenth mile from Calicut, also Malapuram, Tirur and Nilambnr roads similarly blocked ; probably also other trunk roads. Kottakkal Sub-Registrar&apos;s office and post office, Tirur offices, Manjeri Treasury, Tirur, Angacli offices, after our evacuation, known to have been gutted. Two British soldiers, one European from tile works, 15 police and local officials, Tirur, prisoners.&quot; Government have also received information from Inspector-General of Police, indicating that force at Malapuram is all aright. Having observed from the daily Press of 23rd a long report emanating from correspondent of Trichur, Government ^requested Publicity Officer to caution Press in Madras against publication of unverified, hearsay stories calculated to cause alarm. Need for this caution is emphasised by appearance in next issue of Daily Express of a large type heading, &apos; Mr. Austin Still Missing.&apos; This officer is in charge at Malapuram. Further The Hindu of Tuesday, 23rd, published long message from its own correspondent at Shoranur, much of which is entirely without foundation and untrue. Correspondent admittedly based his story on hearsay reports, which he has made no attempt to verify as, in his own words, it was too risky to go to scene of operations. Mischief done by publication of such matter is in no way reduced by qualifying remade on part of correspondent or editor to effect that authority of information cannot be vouched for acceptance without indisputable corroboration. Government confidently hope that responsible Press of Madras will recognise this aspect of matter and will support them by refusing to publish any unverified reports of an alarming nature which they may receive.&quot;From Viceroy, Home Department, 2oth August 1921.Continuation of telegram of yesterday. Moplah disturbances. Following further telegrams dated 24th August, received from Madras : &quot; First. Continuation of our telegram of the 23rd August, M. 27.

Comus expected to arrive at Calicut noon 25th August.&quot;&quot; Second. Your telegram of to-day. Martial law. Government of Madras agree that Ordinance should be promulgated, and (? accept the view) that provisions 11 and 12, namely, for special tribunal and summary of court-martial, are unnecessary at present. They accept the other provisions with the modifications suggested. Areas to be notified should be Taluks Ernad, Walluvanad, Pounani and Calicut, of the Malabar district:   Date 23rd August, provision 6, should be 19th August.&quot;Martial-law Ordinance will probably be promulgated to-day.
