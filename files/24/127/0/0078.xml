MEMORANDUM.August 24s 1921.POSITION OP THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONCERNING KA10A!FES*The Government of the united States having welcomed the suggestion of Lord curzon that there should be a discussion of the question of Mandates Mr, Harvey improves this opportunity to communicate to him the following views of his Government thereon - as it is thought beat to re-state the general principles which are deemed to be involved before proceeding to the&apos; consideration of the precise terms of draft mandates 11.     The Government of the&apos; United staies adheres to the position already stated that the right to dispose of the over-seas possessions of Germany was acquired only through the victory of the Allied and Associated Powers, and that there can be no valid or effective disposition of these territories without the assent of the United States as one of the participants in that viatory.2.     ThiB position of the Uni   1 States Is net opposed, but la confirmed, by the Treaty of Versailles by which Germany renounced in favor of the prinoipal Allied and Associated powers, of whioh the United States waa designated to be one, allher/
her rights arid titles over her overseas possessions.     It may be observed that in providing, as stated in Article 440, for the coming into force of that Treaty when it had been ratified by Germany and three of the principal Allied and Associated Powers it was manifestly not the inton-tion that on such ratification by three powers there should still remain in Germany any undivided share cf title of sovereignty in the overseas possessions described.       It would Beam to be clear that the renunciation Bet forth in Article 119 of the Treaty was not intended to be divisible.In the light of all the pertinent considerations this Government peroelves no possible basis for a claim that the other Principal Allied and Associated Powers would be entitled to exclude the United States from full participation and the United States does not understand that any suoh claim is made.3.   The right of the United States in the terri-tories in question could not be made the subject of such disposition as Is proposed without ita assent, and under its constitutional system the giving of this assent is not exclusively within the authority of the President.     It is thought, however, that there would be no difficulty in negotiating an appropriate treaty if the terms of the mandate were defined in the line,of the following suggestions. It is not the intention of the Government of the United States to raise objection to allocationor/
: or terms of Mandates for the puarpose of seeking additional territory or for any other purpose than to &quot;safeguard the interests of the United States and the fair and equal opportunities whioh it is beloved the United States: should, en joy in common with the other Powers.4.   With respect to Mandate &quot;D&quot;   territories other than those which ware formerly possessions of Germany ^ while it Is true that the United States did not declare war against Turfcay, still the opportunity of the Allied Powers to secure the allocation of Mandates and the administration of territories formerly under Qtorlclsh rule was made possible only through the victory over Germany and the United States assumes that by reason of its relation to that victory and of the fundamental principles recognised by the British Government as applicable to the administration of Mandate &quot;D&quot;   territories, there would be no disposi-tion in relation to any of these territories to discriminate against the United States or to refuse - to safeguard equality of commercial opportunity,50     With this und-erstanding, and withoxit attempting to restate the general principles governing Mandates, which have been the subject of previous correspondence between the two Governments, the Government of the United States desires to submit the following special observations as to the forms of mandates which have been proposed:fa)   Capltulatory. rights.     In the draft for Syria and Lebanon thare is a provision in Article 5 notxound/- S -Cabinet Office Hote.Presumably this is intended;for &quot;A&quot; Mandate.
found.in the&quot;Mandate^,f or-Ma^petamia.and Palestine to the effect that Foreign Consular Tribunals shall continue to perform their duties until the described new legal organisation Is set up.    It is desired that there should be a similar provision in the Mandate for Mesopotamia, and that in the Mandate for Palestine it should be provided that capitulatory rights shall be continued until adequate courts are established.   Provision should also be made in all &quot;A&quot; Mandates for the revival of capitulatory rights in the event of the termination of the mandate regime.(b)   Provisions against discriminatien.The limitation of protection in Articles 11 and 14 of the Mandates for Syria and Lebanon and Ms sop-otamia and of Articles 18 and 21 of the Mandate for Palestine to States that are members of the League of Bfations should be removed and the protect ion extended so as to embrace the United States.   Shis could be effected by referring to any State mentioned in the annex to the Covenant of the League of &apos;nations.     The referehoe to incorporated companies in Article. 11 of tho Mandate for Palestine is too narrow and should be broadened to embrace societies and associations (see Artiole 11 of Mandate for Syria and Lebanon).It is desired that there should also be pro-vision against discrimination in concessions.    British WBW Mandate for Bast Africa, Article 7, provides as follows: &quot;Concessions for the development of natural resources of the territory shall be granted by the Mandatory without distinction on grounds of nationalitybetween
between the nationals of all States members of the League of Rations but on such conditions as will maintain intact the authority of the local Government.&quot;    Similar provision should be inserted in &quot;A&quot; Mandates and broadened to embrace the United States.There should also be appropriate provision against the granting of monopolistic concessions or the monopolising of natural resources by the Ma ndat o ry itself.(C) Mi s s i briari es .In the Landate for Syria and Lebanon protection is accorded provided activities are confined &quot;to the domain of religion.&quot;    It would appear as if the intention were to restrict, if not to eliminate. (See Franco-British Convention, Article 9,  signed at Paris, December 23rd, 1920).    It is desired that present and future activities, both religious and educational, of our missionaries who are nationals of the United States should be fully protected, and it is suggested that provision similar to Article 8 of the British &quot;3&quot; Mandate for German Fast Africa be   incor-porated in all &quot;A&quot; Mandates,(D) It will be understood that the consent of the United States shall be necessary to any modifi-cation of a; Landate after it has been agreed to.Draft &quot;B&quot; Mandates,(A) The provisions of Article    6 of the british... and French Mandates for the Caaeroons and -Togolanc&apos;* and of the Belgian Xlandate for German Ijast Africa, and of Article ? of the British Mandate for German?..      - :::ast/mm     5     m
East Africa, are not extended to the nationals of the United states.    Thi3 should he corrected and it might he sufficient to substitute &quot;nationals of State mentioned in the annex: to the Covenant of the Leagueof Nations&quot; for &quot;Nationals of States members of the League of Nations&quot; in each of these articles.In the third paragraph of the same Article in each Mandate it should also be provided that rnonopo-listic concessions should not be granted by the Mandatory nor should natural resources of the mandated territory be monoplised by the Mandatory itself.(B) Article 8 of the British Mandate for Sast Africa is acceptable and its provisions should be substituted for those of the corresponding Article numbered 7 in the other &quot;3&quot; -Mandates.-(C) Article 10 of the British Mandate ivr East Africa contains a clause &quot;Provided always that the measures adopted to that end do not infringe upon the provisions of this mandate&quot; which might well be added to the corresponding Article 9 of the other &quot;B&quot; Mandates.(D) The consent of the United States will be necessary to modify the Mandate terms.The above views of the United States Government with reference to &quot;A&quot; and MB&quot; Mandates will be com-municated; to the Governments of Prance, Italy and Japan.The following is communicated an special and confidential to the British Government for their information respecting the United States point of
view regarding &quot;C&quot; Mandates, discussion of which does not seem necessary at this time.Draft &quot;C&quot; Mandates except for Yap. (A)   Article 5 should be changed so as to embrace nationals of the United.Gtates and to avoid ambiguity as to educational and charitable activities of mission-arie3.    It would he preferable to have the same pro-vision as in Article 8 of the British &quot;3&quot; Mandate for German East Africa.(b) All &quot;C&quot; Mandates treat mandated territory for administration and legislation a3 an integral portion of the territory of the Mandatory.-  This, unless qualified, would permit discrimination.    It is desired that the Mandatories respectively should guarantee to United States most favoured nation treatment in all &quot;g&quot; Mandate territories reserving, however, the present special treaty rights of the United States as to German Samoa, under Article 3 of the Treaty concluded at Washington ^December 2, 1899.    The Government of the United States has already protested against- the discriminatory tariff imposed &quot;by Few Zealand in violation of this Treaty (in which connection reference is made to the Mote of the Foreign Office dated January 19,  1921, Eo. A171/171/45V(c) There should be provision similar to that pro-posed in the other forms of mandates prohibiting monopolistic concessions by the Mandatory or the monopolising of natural resources by the Mandatory itself. 1(jD) As in other cases, modification of Mandate will be subject to assent of the United States.The/y *i;
The Island of Yap because of its special characteristics and.availability for communication purposes should be treated specially fend negotiations to this end are in progress.     It is not desired to include Yap ia the pre,ent representations as to terms of mandates*6*     In connection with the question of WA* Mandates the following additional points should to noted.(A)    In the note of His Majeatyrs Government of February 28, 1921, relating to the application of the prinoiple of equality of treatment to former Turkish territories It was observed that by article I of the Philippine Petroleum Act, approved August 31, 1920, participation in the working of public lands in the Philippine Islands containing petroloum is oonfined to citizens or corporations of the United states or of the Philippines.     This enactment was mentioned as inconsistent with the general principles announced by this governments to avoid misapprehension upon this point it should be stated that shortly after this enactment in question the Government of the United States recommended that it should be so amended as to conform to the reciprocity provision of the United States General leasing Law of February 26.,&apos; 1920.     At the last session of the Philippine Legislature an amending Bill was passed, the object of which was to relax substantially tho restrictions embodied in the original Act;   nevertheless in the opinion of the Government of the United states the proposed amendment: aid not sufficiently meet thesituation/
situation and it is the intention ef the , Government of the United States to take ali appropriate steps with a view to $ringing about at the next session of the Philippine Legislature in October a further emetu&amp;jaant so that it may ocnf orm ts the reciprocity provision above described.(B]     In the same Bote of Els Majesty^ Government reference is made to a concession said to have been granted before the war by the (Turkish Government to the Turkieh Petroleum Company.   The Government of the United States has already printed out in its Note of November  0, 1920, that such information as it then had indicated that, prior to the war, the Turkish Petroleum Company possessed in Mesopotamia no rights to petroleum concessions or to the exploitation of oil*   The information possessed at present by the Government of the United States confirms this view. The Government of the United States is unable te conclude that any concession was ever granted by the Turkish Government to the Turkish Petroleum Company, and will shortly take up the considerations, advanced by His Majesty^ Government upon this subject. It is desired that if the claim of the Turkish petroleum Company continues to be asserted, appropriate provision be made for the determination of this claim by suitable arbitration.
