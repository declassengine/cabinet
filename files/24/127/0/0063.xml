FOR R E C O R D.     fa.      ^L^u-.gfs DOCUMENT is thjrproper^SECRET.CABINET,CcP. 3562. - \I R E L A IT 33*.THE PRIME MINISTERS S REPLX TO MR.DE VALERA&apos; S LETTER -   DATED &quot;24th AUGUST,,. 1921...(Previous Papers * CP.5149, 3214. 3214-A, and 3258)..10, Downing Street,London, 1.26th August, 1921.The British Government are profoundly disappointed by yoursee vCP.3258. letter of August 24th^, which was delivered to me yesterday.You write of the conditions of a meeting between us as though no meeting had ever taken place.    I must remind you, therefore, that when i asked you to meet me six weeks ago, I made no pre-liminary conditions of any sort.   You c&apos;ame to London on that invite-tion and exchanged views with me at three meetings of eon-siderable length.    The proposals which I made to you after those meetings were based upon full and sympathetic consideration&apos;of the views which you expressed.   As I have already saidj they were not made in any haggling spirit.    On the contrary; my colleagues and i went to the very limit of our powers in en-deavourins; to reconcile British and Irish interests.    Our pro-posals have gone far beyond all precedent, and have been approved as liberal by the whole civilised world.   Even in quarters which have shown&apos;a.sympathy with the most extreme of Irish claims, they are regarded as the. utmost which the Empire can reasonably &quot;offer or Ireland reasonably expect.    Theonly criticism of them which I have yet heard outside Ireland is from those who maintain that our proposals have outstepped both warrant and wisdom in their liberality.   Your letter shows no recognition of this, and further negotiations must, I fear, be futile unless some definite progress is made towards aooep-tance of a basi s.You declare that our proposals involve a surrender ofIreland&apos;s whole national position and reduce her to subservi-ence.   &quot;What are the facts?   Under the settlement which we- 1 -
have outlined Trale^d-..wou^ nerve and fibre ofher national existence;    she Would speak her own language and make her own religious life;   she would have complete power Over taxation and finance, subject only to an agreement for keening trade and transport as free as possible between her-self and Great Britain, her befct market;    ahe would have un-controlled authority over education and all tile moral andspiritual interests of her race!   she would have it also overlaw and order, over,;/ land and agriculture, over the conditions of labour and indus-try, over the health and homes o  her people, and over her own land defence.   She would, in fact i within the Shores of Ireland, be free in every aspect of national activity, national expression and national development.   The Stated of the Ameri-don Union, sovereign though they be, enjoy no such range of rights.   And our proposals go even further, for they invite Ireland to take her place as a partner in the great common-wealth o** free nations united by allegiance to the&quot; King.\Ve consider that these proposals completely fulfil your wish that the principle of &quot;government by consent of the governed&quot; should he the broad guiding principle of the eettle-ment which your plenipotentiaries are to negotiate.   That principle was first developed in England, and is the mainsprjng of the representative institutions which ahe was the first to create.    It was spread by her throughout the world, and is now the Very life of the British Commonwealth.   We could hot have inviied the Irish people to take their place in that Commonwealth on any other principle, and we are convinced that through it we can heal the old misunderstanding^ and achieve an endurine partnership as honourable to Ireland as to the other nations of which the Commonwealth consists.But when you &amp;rgue that the relations of Ireland with the&quot; British Empire&quot;are comparable In principle to those of Holland
or Belgium with the German Empire, I find it necessary to repeat once more that those are premises which no BritishOovp.rntr.ent, whatever its complexion,  can ever accept.    Indemanding that. Ireland should he treated as a separatesovereign Power, with no allegiance to the Crown and noloyalty to the sister nations of the Commonwealth, you areadvancing claims       which the most famous national leaders in Irish history, from Grattan to Parnell and Redmond, haveexplicitly disowned.    Grattan in a famous phrase declaredthat &quot;the ocean protests against separation, and the seaagainst union&quot;.&apos;  Daniel 0&apos;Connell, the most eloquent perhapsof all the spokesmen of the Irish national cause, protestedthus in the House of Commons in 1830:-&quot; Never, did monarch receive more undivided allegiance than the present King from the men who in Ireland agitate the Repeal of the Union. Never, too, was there a grosser calumny than , to assert thsb   they wish to produce a separa-tion between&apos; the two&apos; countries.    Never was there a greater mistake than to suppose that we wish to dissolve the connection.&quot;And in a well-known letter to the Duke&apos;-Of Wellington in 1845,Thomas Davis, the fervent exponent of the ideals of YoungIreland, wrote:-&quot;I do not seek a raw repeal of the Act of Union.    I want you to retain the Imperial Par-1lament with-its Imperial power.    I ask you only to. disencumber it of those cares which exhaust its patience and embarrass its attention.    I ask you to give Ireland a Senate of some sort, select-ed by the people, in part, or in whole:      vying -their Customs and Excise and other taxes;    making their roads, harbours, railways, canals, and bridges:    encouraging their manufactures, commerce, agriculture and fisheries:&apos; settling their Poor Laws,.their tithes, tenures. Grand Juries and franchises:    giving a vent to ambition, an oppor-tunity for knowledge, restoring the absentees, securing work, and diminishing poverty, crime, ignorance and discontent.    This, were I. an Englishman, I should ask for England, besides the imperial Parliament.    So would I for Wales, w,ere I a Welshman, and for Scotland, were I a  : Scotchman;    this I ask: for &apos; Ireland.11-&apos;The British Government have offered Ireland all that 0&apos;Gonnelland ^homas Davis asked,  and more;    and we are met only by an
unqualified demand that we should recognise Ireland as a foreign power.    It is playing with phrases to suggest that the principle of government by consent of the governed compels a recognition of that demand on our part, or that, in repudiating it we are straining geographical end histor-ical considerations to justify a claim to ascendency over the Irish race.    There is no political principle, however clear, that can be applied without regard to limitations imposed by physical and historical facts.   Those limitations are as necessary as the very principle itself to the structure of every free nation?    to deny them would involve the dissolution of all democratic States.   It is on these elementary grounds that we have called attention to the governing force of the geographical propinquity of these two islands, and of their long historic association despite great differences of character and race.   We do not believe that the permanent reconciliation of Great Britain and Ire-land oan ever be attained without a recognition of their physical and historical inter-dependence, which makes com-plete political and economic separation impracticable for both.I cannot better express the British standpoint in thisrespect than in words used of the Northern and SouthernStates by Abraham Lincoln in the First Inaugural Address.They were spoken by him on the brink of the American civil war, which he was striving to a^art:-&quot;Physioally speaking&quot; (he said)  &quot;we cannot separate.   We cannot remove our respective sections from each other., nor build an inpass-able wall between them. ... It is impossible, then, to make that intercourse more advantage-ous or more satisfactory after separation than before.  ... Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always;    and when, after much loss on both sides and no gain on either, you cease fighting,  the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are agazn upon you.&quot;I do not think it can be reasonably contended that the rela-tions of Great Britain and Ireland are in any differentcase.
I thought I &quot;had&quot; made it clear, both in my .convereauions&apos; with you and in my two -sxihsoq-aent^oorffiiTunicatlona, that we can discuss no settlement which involves a refusal on the part of Ireland to accept our invitation to free, equal, an loyal partnership in the British Commonwealth under one Sovereign.   Wo are reluctant to precipitate the issue, but we must point out that a prolongation of the prH^8iibs^K:*^ of affairs is dangerous o   Action is being taken-ix^-^rtouB&quot; directions which, if continued9 would prejudice tho truce and must ultimately lead to its termination,,   TMs would indeed be deplorable *   Whilst, therefore, prepared to make every allowance as to time which will advance the cause of peace,, we cannot prolong a mere exchange of notes.    It is essential that some definite and immediate progress should be made towards a basis upon which further negotiations can usefully proceed e   Your letter seems to us unfer tons tel to show no Such progress *In this and my previous letters I have set forth the considerations which mast govern the attitude of His Majest Government in any negotiations which they undertake-   If you are prepared to examine how far these considerations ea be reconciled with the aspirations which you represent, I shall be happy to meet you and your colleagues,I am, .Sir,Yours faithfully, CSigned) D.
