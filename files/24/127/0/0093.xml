HTHE P31MB MINISTER&apos;S REPLY BATSD^SEPTEMBER 9th 1921 TO MB. DE valera&apos;s LETTER OF AUGUST 3C1,h. 1921.(Previous Papers C,P&apos;s 3149, 3214, 3214A, 3258, 3262 ________and^3278K________Town Hall, Inverness. * September 7th. 1921.Sir,His Majesty&apos;s Government have considered your letter of August 30th, and have to make the following observations upon it.The principle of government by consent of the governed is the foundation of British constitutional development, but we cannot accept as a basis of practical conference an interpretation of that principle which would commit us to any demands which you might present,     even to the extent of setting up a republic and repudiating the Crown.    You must be aware that conference on such a basis is impossible.      So applied, the principle of government by consent of the governed would undermine the fabric of every democratic State and drive the civilised world back into tribalism.On the other hand, we have invited you to discuss our pro-posals on their merits, in order that you may have no doubt as to the scope and sincerity of our intentions.      It would be open to you in such a conference to raise the subject of guarantees on any points in which you may consider Irish freedom prejudiced by these proposals.His Majesty&apos;s Government are loth to believe that you will insist upon rejecting their proposals without examining them in conference.      To decline to discuss a settlement which rvould, bestow upon the Irish people tho fullest freedom of nationaldevelopment.......
development within the Empire can only mean that you repudiate all allegiance to the Crown and ail membership of the British Commonwealth.     If we were to draw this inference from your letter, then further dismission between us could serve no useful purpose, and all conferendo would be vain.    If, however, we are mistaken in this inference, as wo still hope, and if ybur real objection to our) proposals is that they offer Ireland less than the liberty which we have described, that objection all be explored at a Conference.You will agree that this correspondence has lasted long enough.     His Majesty&quot;s Government must therefore ask for a definite reply as to whether you are prepared to enter a Confer-ence to ascertain how the association of Ireland with the community of nations known as the British Empire can best be reconciled with Xwlsfo. national aspirations.     If, as we hope, your answer is in the affirmative, I suggest that the Conference should meet at Inverness on the 20th instant.I am,Sir,Yours faithfully, (Signed)   B. LLOYD GEORGE.Whitehall Gardens. S*W. September 9th 1921.
