PART II. - GENERAL INTELLIGENCE:;AFGHANISTAN.According to the latest telegrams the hopes of obtaining an exclusive treaty appear to be vanishing, unless something occurs at once to induce the Afghans to execute a complete volte face.MESOPOTAMIA.There have been raids organised by Turkish officers and floods of Turkish propaganda, violently anti-British ancj anti-Peisal, on the northern frontier, and the situation remains delicate,RUSSIA.Azerbaijan.&quot; 1 it fs reported that 18 oil wells are on fire in the Sarakhanah district of Baku, and that there are no means available for extinguishing the fire.
