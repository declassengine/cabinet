W.-E.The Wab Office,29th August, 1921.1. The question of the status of the British Commander-in-Chief at Constantinople is bound up with the larger question of the Inter-Allied Commissions to be set up under the terms of the Treaty of Sevres (see Appendix A).The clauses of this Treaty are to be executed by Turkey under the control of certain Inter-Allied Commissions.The execution of the Military Clauses is entrusted to a &quot; Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control and Organization.&quot; The duties of this Commission are laid down in detail in Articles 196 to 200 of the Treaty. The Commission is charged, on the one hand, with the supervision of the execution of the clauses relating .to the reduction of the Turkish Forces, the delivery of arms and war material, &amp;c, and, on the other hand, with the organization and control of the new Turkish armed forces.2. After the Treaty had been published the Allied Military Committee of Versailles drew up certain instructions for the constitution and functions of the Inter-Allied Commission of Control and Organization referred to above. The final text of these instructions was drafted on 22nd September, 1920, and extracts are contained in &apos; Appendix 03. It will be seen that the recommendations contain a proposal that the dual functions of the main Commission should be carried out by two Sub-Commissions : (a.) Sub-Commission of Control.(b.) Sub-Commission of Organization.,3. Meanwhile an Inter-Departmental Conference had considered the question in London, and had put forward the following proposals : (i.) That the Presidency of the Military Commission of Control and Organization should be combined with the high command of the Allied forces in the demilitarized zone.(ii.) That the Presidency should be rotary on the analogy of the Financial Commission.(hi.) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should claim that for the first period, the Presidency, combined with the high command, should be entrusted to a British Officer. They considered that there was a very strong case for the British to claim the Presidency at all events for the first period of the .   existence of the Commission.(iv.) As regards the period for which the Presidency should be held, it was decided that in the first place it would &quot;be advisable to press for a period of 2 years, but that if this were found impossible, a period of 1 year should be accepted.(B21/-.W3)   70   8/21   H&amp;S,Ltd   9420woCP. 8268.
4. The Foreign Office put forward the above proposals to the French Government in a Note dated 7th September, 1920, and the French Government replied on 20th September. They drew attention to the fact that the Treaty contains no specific recommendation as regards the Presidency of the Military Commission. They said, however, that the Presidency of the Financial Commission devolves alternatively on a French, British and Italian representative, and that the Presidency of the Commission of the Straits will be exercised in turn by those members of the Commission who have the right to vote.They pointed out that the rotation of Presidencies of Commissions was thereby established, and that, it being understood that no Power can exercise the Presidency of more than one Commission at a time, it follows that each Presidency must be held for the same time. As it was laid down that the Presidency of the Commission of the Straits would be exercised for 2 years, it is implied that the Presidency of the other Commissions will be for the same period.Should the British Government concur in this view, the French Government would agree to the suggestions put forward by the British, Government that the Presidency of the Military Commission of Control and Organization should be entrusted to a British officer, it being understood that the Presidency of the Financial Commission would be given to a Frenchman for two years, and the Presidency of the Commission of the Straits to an Italian for the same period.The French Government agreed to the British Governments suggestion that the functions of the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Force at Constantinople, and of the President of the Military Commission of Control and Organization, should be in the hands of one and the same person. It follows, therefore, that this Command will be exercised for the first period by a British General Officer.The Foreign Office signified their agreement with the proposals put forward bv . the French.5. On 8th October, 1920, an Inter-Departmental Conference agreed that the following points should be submitted to the other Allies : (1.) (a.) That the Supreme Commander at Constantinople should hold the Presidency of the Commissions of Control and Organization, and that the duration of tenure should be not less than two years to date from the ratification of the Treaty.(b.) For the first period of two years the appointment to be held by,a British officer as from 1st November, 1920, although the period of tenure would only commence from the date of ratification of the Peace Treaty.(c.) That the Allied Commander-in-Chief should be directly under the Council of Ambassadors at Constantinople.(2.) That the Sub-Commission of Organization was to be directly under the Allied Commander-in-Chief, without the intervention of any other Allied Com-mittee. A British Major-General to be President, and members to be senior military representatives of France, Italy and Japan.G. On 1st November, 1920, a Meeting was held at the War Office to consider the Military details in connection with the Commission of Control and Organization. Lieut.-General Sir C. H. Harington, was in the Chair, and the French and Italian Military Attaches attended, as well asi representatives of the Foreign Office and. the War Office ; a copy of the minutes of this meeting is contained in Appendix C.7. On 11th November, 1920, the Foreign Office forwarded a copy of a draft despatch which it was proposed to send to the French and Italian Governments, summarizing the various proposals hitherto considered in connection with the execution of the Treaty. In making this communication the Foreign Office expressed the hope that the French and Italian Governments would signify their approval at the earliest possible date, and would proceed without delay to select their representatives on the various Commissions in order that they might proceed to Constantinople, and take such preliminary measures as might be found possible to enable them to take up their duties as soon as the Treaty was ratified.The summary of the proposals hitherto considered, and for the most&apos;part accepted by all three Governments, was specified and subsequently embodied, with slight modifications, in the memorandum of, 14th of December referred to in paragraph 10 below.8. On 6th November, 1920, the French submitted a Note to the Foreign Office in   which they  agreed to the immediate assumption of the Allied Command by
370General Harington, and to the proposal that his period of tenure as President of the Military Commission before . ratification should not count in the two year period, which was to date from ratification. Their agreement was subject to the condition that a similar rule regarding the period of tenure should be applied to the other Commissions.The Italian Government also agreed to General Harington taking up his duties in anticipation of ratification, and that the duration of the Command of the Allied Force shall be for two years from the date of ratification, provided that the duration of the Commission is prolonged for six years.9. The French Government went back on this Note of the 6th November for no Paris,valid reason, and refused to recognise General Harington&apos;s position as Allied Commander- No. 1368, .   r*i - n dated 2ndin-Chief. December,1920.10. On 14th December, the Foreign Office   submitted a memorandum on the B. 15597/ various  points  that  had  recently  been  unofficially  discussed   and, approved  by jj^7^4-4^, representatives of the French and Italian Governments.     This memorandum took the pecemDer place of the draft despatch of the 11th November (paragraph 7) and contained the 1920. following decisions : (i.) The first President of the Military Commission of Control and Organization, with which post is combined the Supreme Allied Command, is to be British.(ii.) The Chairman of the Financial Commission, and the President of the Naval Commission are to be French, and the Presidents of the Straits and Air Commissions are to be Italian.(iii.) All these posts are to be-held for two years from the coming into force.of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, and are to be held in rotation by the representatives of the three Powers, so that for each two year period the three chief Commissions shall be shared among the three Powers. For this purpose the life of the Military Commission shall be extended from five to six years.(iv.) In the case of its being found necessary to institute any of the Commissions before the ratification of the Treaty, it is understood that the period of the Presidency between the date of its assumption, and the coming into force of the Treaty shall not be counted in the two year period commencing with the ratification ; this applies similarly to the Supreme Command, (v.) It is understood that the various Commissions shall be under the general authority of the Allied Diplomatic Representatives at Constantinople, so as to avoid the loss of time involved in unnecessary reference to the respective Governments.(vi.) There shall be established, subject to the rights of the Financial Commission, three subsidiary permanent posts, viz., an Inspector-General of Turkish Customs (Article 246), a Secretary-General of the Financial Commission and a Controller of the Budget (Article 232). (vii.) The British Military Representative, General Sir C. Harington, who is already in Constantinople, shall assume the functions of Allied Commander-in-Chief at once without prejudice to his two years&apos; tenure of command, and shall make arrangements with the French and Italian Military Representatives at Constantinople for the issue of a suitable order announcing his assumption of command.(viii.) The practical execution of. the military clauses of the Treaty shall be left to the Military Representatives of the three Powers at Constantinople on the lines already discussed in London after full consideration of the recom-mendations contained in the report adopted by the Allied Military Commission at Versailles, (ix.) With regard to the political considerations involved in the distribution of the Gendarmerie, to be organized and officered by officers of the three countries, the French and Italian Governments will provide the necessary officers for the Gendarmerie zones allotted to them under the Tripartite Agreement. The remainder of Anatolia shall be under international control, and the Military Commission shall decide as to its division into territorial areas, in which shall be employed Gendarmerie organized by officers of the three countries.(9420)a 2
0152/5742, dated 31st December, 1920.B. 15587/ 10576/44, dated 22nd December, 1920.B. 226/22/ 44,dated 12th January, 1921.E. 893/22/ dated 24th January, 1921.Rome, 27, dated 26th January, 1921.0152/5742, dated 25th January, 1921.E. 1094/22/ 44,dated 27thJanuary,1021.11. On 31st December, the Army Council again pressed the Foreign Office to approach the French Government on the subject.12. The next move was that the French Government issued orders to M. de Clausieres to proceed at once to Constantinople as French Financial Commissioner. It was agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not recognize M. de Clausieres as President of the Commission until the French Government had recognized General Harington as President of the Military Commission of Control a,nd Organization.13. The French Government were approached accordingly and they agreed that General Harington should assume his duties as President of the Military Commission at Constantinople simultaneously with the assumption by M. de Clausieres of the Presidency of the Financial Commission.14. General Harington then pressed for the early appointment of the French and Italian representatives on the Commission of Organization in order to complete the preliminary work required in connection with the raising of the Turkish Gendarmerie. The Army Council asked the Foreign Office to endeavour to persuade the French and Italian Governments to nominate their representative accordingly, and the Foreign Office did so.   The Italians appointed General Mombelli as their representative.15. The French Government had meanwhile taken no steps to inform General Charpy, the French General at Constantinople, of the agreement made in London -regarding General Harington&apos;s assumption of command, so the Army Council asked the Foreign Office to bring this question to the notice of the French Government. This was done, and the French replied that they would consider the matter and let the Foreign Office have an&apos; early reply. Meanwhile the departure of M. de Clausieres had been delayed, which may possibly account for the delay in the French recognition of General Harington&apos;s position.16. In the meantime a French Note dated 21st January, 1921, had been received,in which the French Government acknowledged the justice of our demand that general harington should be given the inter-allied command at once, but they attempted to extortfrom His Majesty&apos;s Government a promise that if they recognized General Harington,we should recognize a French General Officer as President of the Sub-Commissionof Organization.   The Foreign Office -protested strongly against this French proposal&apos;being put forward at the eleventh hour, and pointed out that the Inter-Allied military committee at Versailles, presided bver by Marshal Foch, had awarded the presidency of the Sub-Commission of Organization to an officer of the same nationality as thePresident of the Inter-Allied Commission, and that the modified scheme drawn up inNovember, 1920, had included this arrangement : that Major-General Franks had been duly nominated for this post, and that the French Government had been officiallynotified accordingly- on 20th November, 1920.17. Another point now came up for discussion; this was the question whether there was to be a Council of three Generals at Constantinople, with General Haringtonas   President, or&apos; whether  the   Allied   Commander-in-Chief  should  work   directly with the Presidents of the Sub-Commissions without the intervention of any furtherCommission  of  Allied   Generals.     Although it was decided  at   the  War   Officemeeting held on 1st November, -1920 (vide paragraph  6), that there should not be a council of three Generals, this decision does not appear to  have  been officiallycommunicated to the French   and Italian   Governments, and it seemed  probablethat they were counting on a Committee of Generals, and had not examined   oraccepted the British point of view.    General Harington was strongly of the opinion thatthe Committee of three Generals over which he would preside would only result indelaying and hampering the work -of the two Sub-Commissions, and the War Officeendorsed- this view.    It seemed that the appointment of General Mombelli by theItalian Government made it clear that they had in view a Council of Allied Generals atConstantinople, which would presumably consist of General Harington as President,with General Charpy and General Mombelli as Members.0152/5742, The &quot;Army Council protested against this Council of Generals in a letter dateddated 5th 5th February, 1921.JbeDruary, J 1920.E. 1673/22/ 18. In reply to the Army Council protest, the Foreign Office pointed out that the44, French  and  Italian Governments had never officially accepted the arrangementsFebruary11 ProPose(^ by the War Office for the execution of the military clauses without a 1921.Oonstanti-nople, I. 9840, dated 6th February, 1921.
-    371^supervising Council of Allied Generals. The War Office scheme &quot;was commimicated to the French and Italian Governments indirectly through their Military Attaches at the meeting held at the War Office on 1st November, 1920 (paragraph 6). As it had not buen officially notified to the French and Italian representatives in London, the Foreign Office considered that it was doubtful whether they would be able to induce the French and Italians to accept it. They also pointed out that the expression &quot; Military Inter-A Hied Commission of Control and Organization&quot; implied that there should be a supervising body of three ecpial representatives, similar to the Financial Commission, and not that there should be a President supervising two Sub-Commissions, for if the latter arrangement were carried out the French would be represented only by their delegates on the two Sub-Commissions. The Foreign Office concurred, however, in the War Office proposal that until the French Government withdrew their claim to the Presidency of the Sub-Commission of Organization, and until they assented to the assumption of the Supreme Allied Command by General Harington, it would be useless to urge upon them our objections to the establishment of a Military Commission of three Genex-als.19. In. a Despatch from the British Ambassador in (Paris, dated 8th February, e. 1825/22/ 1921, it was stated that the French and Italian Military Attaches had failed to obtain 44, &apos; the endorsements   of their   respective Governments  to the proposals  put  forward d&amp;^d 19th at the War Office meeting on  1st November,   1920.  The Foreign Office  pointed 192l.   ?&apos; out that as regards tbe Supervising Council of Allied Generals, it would be useless to press the French to drop this proposal, especially as it would be easier to insist on the recognition of General Harington and Major-General Franks if this further demand were eliminated. . .       , .20. The French Government then stated that they wished to postpone General . Harington&apos;s recognition until after the Conference which was to be held in March.21. The question of the Council of Generals was referred to General Harington, 0152/5742, who reluctantly agreed to concur in the acceptance of the French and Italian point of        2^r(* view on the subject,  if such   concurrence was considered necessary to secure his 1921.&amp;  &apos; appointment and that of General Franks, but he urged that another British General should be included in the Council of Generals over which he would preside.22. On 19th March, 1921,  the Foreign Office sent a despatch to Paris which B. 3446/22/ embodied the present position of the discussions on the subject of General Harington&apos;s        21gt command and the presidency of the Military Sub-Commission of Organization.   This March despatch pointed out that the French Government were practically pledged to accept 1921. General Harington&apos;s supreme command ; the execution of the arrangements had only been deferred at their request in anticipation of the London Conference introducing some material alteration in the situation.    The French Ambassador had admitted that the ,Conference had not led to any change to render less pressing than before the appointment -of a supreme Allied commander.As regards the important appointment of General Franks, the. French Ambassador had made it clear that the French Government meant to maintain their attitude of obstruction, but he said that it was quite true that Marshal Foch&apos;s Committee had agreed to a British President of that Sub-Conimission and that the French Military Attache had accepted it When the details of the scheme were discussed in London. The French Government, however, maintained that this attitude on the part of their Military Attache, who necessarily took into account the Military side of the question only, had lost sight altogether of its political aspect. They considered that French public opinion would accuse them of making unjustifiable concessions to Great Britain in Turkev, and that there would be Parliamentary opposition to an arrangement by which the organization of the Gendarmerie, as well as the presidency of the higher military commission, should be placed in British hands.The French Ambassador, however, put forward a proposal that, if the British Government agreed to the Secretary General of the Financial Commission being French, it might be possible to pursuade the French Government to allow a British General to be Chairman of the Sub-Commission of Organization. The Foreign Office pointed out that it was difficult to base a compromise 011 this suggestion because -the British Government had already expressed an opinion that there was no necessity^:for the post of Secretary General at all.2a. On 31st March, 1921, the Army Council enquired whether the recognition of0152/5819, General Franks by the French Government still depended on the creation of a Council March31St of Generals, or if the remarks of the French Ambassador quoted above were to be taken 1921. &apos; as a refusal to negotiate on this basis.

On 2nd April, 192], the Foreign Office pressed the French Government to-give immediate effect to the promise contained in their Note of the 6th November, 1920 (vide paragraph 8 above).25. The British Ambassador in Paris reported that the French were ready to agree to the immediate assumption of Supreme Command by General Harington on condition that they received satisfaction as regards other appointments, namely, the presidency of&quot; the Sub-Commission of Organization and the Secretary-Generalship of the Financial Commission.The Foreign Office asked the War Office whether the Army Council were prepared to abandon General Franks&apos; claims to the appointment of the Sub-Commission of&quot; Organization in the hope of securing the immediate establishment of General Harington as Allied Commander-in-Chief.26. The War Office replied that it was undesirable to yield to the French demands with regard to the presidency of the Sub-Commission of Organization, and they suggested that if an agreement with the French Government could not be obtained,, the French Government should he confronted with the alternative of the immediate withdrawal of all British troops from Turkey.27. On 19th April, 1921, the British Ambassador interviewed Monsieur Briand on the subject, and he apparently received the British Ambassadors proposals sympathetically. He stated that he understood that the French objections had been raised entirely by the French Military Authorities.28. On 29th April, 1921, the Army Council ,informed the Foreign Office that, in view of the urgency of the immediate establishment of- unity of command at Constantinople, they would be reluctantly prepared to accept a compromise on the following lines : They suggested that the Commissions of Control and Organization be divided into three Sub-Commissions instead of two, that the Sub-Commission of Control should remain unchanged, but that the Sub-Commission of Organization should be divided into two separate Sub-Commissions, one to be termed the Sub-Commission of Gendarmerie, the other to be termed the Sub-Commission of &quot; Special Elements.&quot; If this proposal were adopted, they would be prepared to agree to the Sub-Commission of Gendarmerie being presided over by a French General for the first two years, provided that the Sub-Commission of &quot; Special Elements &quot; be presided over by a British General, Major-General Frauks, during the same-period.29. This proposal was put to the French Government in a Foreign Office despatch, dated 23rd May, 1921, which contained the following: &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to agree that in return for the immediate recognition by the French Government of the supreme command of General Harington over the Allied Military Forces at Constantinople, the Sub-Commission of Organization should be replaced by two Sub-Commissions for the Organization of the gendarmerie and for the &quot; Special Elements&quot; respectively. Under this arrangement the President of the Military Commission would have under him, firstly, the Sub-Commission of Control presided over by an Italian ; secondly, the Sub-Commission of Gendarmerie presided over by a French General for two years, and thirdly, the Sub-Commission of &quot; Special Elements &quot; presided over for the same period by a British General, who would in fact be Major-General Franks.&quot; &apos; &apos;30. The French replied by making a counter/ proposal, namely, that instead of replacing the Sub-Commission of Organization by two Sub-Commissions, the presidency of the former body should be entrusted to General Charpy, now in command of the French troops at Constantinople, instead of to a new French General. This Sub-Commission of Organization would include under the presidency of General Charpy, General Franks and a Senior Officer of each of the1 interested powers. It was pointed out that this proposal would have the advantage of reducing the number of Generals necessary for the Organization of the Commissions and would involve no changa in the higher Military Allied personnel on the spot.31. General Harington considered that this proposal would be unworkable and would present no solution of the difficulty.32. On 19th June, 1921, Lord Curzon concluded an agreement with the French by which General Harington should assume immediate command of the Allied troops in Constantinople. It was further agreed that the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control and Organization should supervise the three Sub-Commissions.(i.) The.Sub-Commission of Control presided over by an Italian officer, (ii.) The Sub-Commission of Gendarmerie presided over by a French officer, and (iii.) The Sub-Commission of &quot;Special Elements&quot; presided over by a British, officer.
372tIt was also agreed that the post of permanent Secretary-General of the Financial &apos;Commission should be allotted to a Frenchman, and that the post of Inspector-General of Customs would go to a British official. A third similar post was to be devised for an Italian, in order to maintain the principle of equal distribution.Both the French and Italian representatives pressed that General Harington Paris, 394, should assume command as quietly and as unostentatiously as possible;  that no        1^21 proclamation should be issued ; and that generally the appearance of a war measure      &apos; ; should be avoided.33. General Harington was informed of these decisions accordingly.   He - stated 446, that he would write privately to the French and Italian High Commissioners and Commanders, and say how honoured he was to command their- troops, but he did not      &apos; propose to do this until they themselves had notified him oi the decision to recognize his supreme command, and he would not issue a proclamation.34. The High Commissioner at Constantinople, in reviewing the question, reported 460, that he considered that the Allied arguments in favour of keeping matters secret were        2^*^ a mere pretext, and that the real motives of the French and Italians were to avoid the&apos;     &apos; enhancement of British ]3restige at the expense of their own.   He reported that the attitude of the French and Italian High Commissioners led him to suspect that their intention was to maintain the status quo ante, and that they affected to regard the matter as so secret that it could not even be mentioned. . He suggested that we should be authorized to treat the matter as one that must be made known to the public.The Foreign Office approved of this suggestion. j9f&apos;jJune, 1921.35. At this time the situation in Constantinople had become dangerous owing to 476, the discovery of a Bolshevik plot for a revolution in the town.    General Harington juj6d -j^j considered it necessary, in the interests of public security, to arrest a number of      &apos; dangerous characters.    This was done without reference to the Allied High Commis-sioners as a purely Military measure in the interests of public security for which General Harington is entirely responsible.  The French and Italian High Commissioners took the opportunity of objecting strongly to General Harington&apos;s action in ordering these arrests without previously consulting them.    They insisted that in future all measures   which   had   political   aspects   should   be   referred   to   the   Allied   High Commissioners   before   application.    It  was   pointed  out that  General  Haringtorfs action was in no sense a political measure, but was merely directed against malefactors plotting against public security for which he was responsible,   Whereupon the French and Italian High Commissioners replied that General Harington was in fact responsible, but he was responsible to the Allied High Commissioners who represented in present conditions the real Government of &quot;the country.The British High Commissioner at Constantinople also reported that the French 477, and Italian Authorities at Constantinople bitterly resented the united Command con- y^j   1921 ferred upon General Harington, and intended to reduce it as far as possible to a dead&apos; letter, and that neither of them had acknowledged General Haringt6n&apos;s assumption of command.36. On 4th July, 1921, a meeting of High Commissioners, Admirals and 530, Generals was held at which General Harington&apos;s assumption of supreme command was j^*ed accepted by the French and Italian High Commissioners in most generous terms. At the same time time they did not accept the view that until ratification of the Peace Treaty General Harington is the sole responsible authority. They claim that General Harington&apos;s activities should be confined to military measures and that the town of Constantinople should be governed by them. General Harington could not accept this view as a state of war exists and the Allies are in military occupation.37. On 6th July, 1921, Monsieur Briand stated to the  Senate Commission on 465, Foreign Affairs that France bad agreed to place French troops at Constantinople under the command of a British General, but that it was clearly understood that in no circum-    *&apos; stances and in no degree would these troops be employed in operations of war, thus taking sides in the Turko-Greek conflict.38. General Harington&apos;s Allied Headquarters were established at Constantinople 625, on 18th July, 1921, with the full approval of the French and Italians,    On the same dated 18th day he held a large Conference of Allied Commanders and their staffs to. co-ordinate the Jllly&apos;ia21-plans for the defence of Constantinople.39. On 22nd July the French and Italian flight Commissioners intimated that 527, they had received notifications from their Governments to the effect that the General j**ed ^1 Officer Commanding at Constantinople should be considered to be under the direct u y&apos; -authority of the Allied High Commissioners.   The French High Commissioner also
stated that the French General Officer Commanding had not yet been notified by his-War Office of the decision regarding General Haringtoifs assumption of command. 663, 40. It appears that the French and Italians, while admitting the full Militaryj**ed ^921 Power of General Harington, want to set up the Allied High Commissioners as a de 667 &apos; facto Government for everything outside his Military province without waiting for dated 26th ratification. The French Government even go so far as to say that the July, 1921. authority of the Allied High Commissioners should extend to military  matters.General Pelle&quot; has admitted quite frankly that the real bone of contention is that, with the Allied High Command held by the British and the powers claimed by General Harington as Military Governor up to the ratification of the Treaty, there appears to be too much British element in the picture; They, therefore, want to set up a Council of&quot; Ambassadors with executive authority now instead of waiting for ratification. General Harington reported that it would be fatal to establish a dual control in existing circumstances as appeals to the High Commissioners would undermine bis authority and he would be over-ruled by a majority.41. The view of the British Foreign Office on the question is that General Harington is in no way responsible to the High Commissioners, although he should keep in close touch with them, and be at their disposal in a consultative capacity.. .He is free to act on his own initiative in all purely military questions and in matters affecting the safety of the Allied troops, the maintenance of order and the administration of Martial Law in the area under his command. He is responsible to the Allied Governments, through the Army Council, in the case of His Majesty&apos;s-Government, and in the case of the French and Italian Governments through the French and Italian Generals. The latter should be consulted on, and kept fully informed of, his actions, although their approval is not required.Before taking any definite decision or approaching the French&apos; and Italian Governments, the Foreign Office propose to await the views of Sir Horace Rumbold.42. The legal advisers of the Army Council are of opinion that General. Harington&apos;s attitude is correct from the point of view of International and Consti-tutional Law, and that, in the absence of any definite instructions to the contrary from His Majesty&apos;s Government, he is entitled and bound as Commander-in-Chief in occupation of enemy territory to take all such steps as he may consider necessary for the safety of his army and the maintenance of public order.B. 8233/22/ 43. Another point has now been raised by the Italian Government who desire&apos; 44j that the presidency of the Sub-Commissions of Control should be held by the British,Ju*yd1921 French and Italian representatives in v rotation.   As the Sub-Commission of Control \will cease to exist when the disarmament of Turney is complete the desire of the Italian Government to apply the principle of rotation is readily comprehensible.The question of the rotation of these posts was not discussed in Paris, and the Foreign Office are awaiting the opinion of the Army Council before taking the views of the French Government on the matter.44. The principle of rotation, if applied to the Sub-Commissions, would mean that the following changes would take place in the various Presidencies of Commissions, time being reckoned in each case from the date of ratification of the Treaty by Turkey.1. At the end of 6 months (the time fixed by the Treaty for the completion of Turkish disarmament) the Sub-Commission of Control would cease to exist and the Italian president of this Sub-Commission would disappear.2. At the end of   years  (i.) The British would  hand   over the  Supreme. Command and the presidency of the Military Commission to the French, (ii.) The British would hand over the Sub-Commission of Special Elements-- to the Italians.(iii.) The British would take  over the Sub-Commission of Gendarmerie-from the French.45. Thus the principle of rotation would have this advantage, that we should gain, the Presidency of the Sub-Commission of Gendarmerie in exchange for that of the Special Elements, and the Gendarmerie is more important of the two.46. On the other hand it is for consideration whether 2 years is not too short a.
period for one power to hold the Presidency of these Sub-Commissions, and whether the forces in question would not suffer unduly in organization and training owing to too frequent changes in the staff.A longer period would certainly be desirable from the point of view of the efficiency of these forces, but, on the other hand, a 2 year term would do much to prevent any particular power establishing too great a hold over the force Cor which its president is responsible.It must be remembered that all Sub-Commissions are subordinate to the Inter-Allied Military Commission, the presidency of which passes by rotation to the representatives of the three powers.Summary.The points settled are : &apos; (1.) That the British hold the Supreme Military Command now and for 2 years from the date of the ratification of the Treaty, and that the British Commander also holds the Presidency of the Inter-Allied Commission of Control and Organization for this period.That the French hold the Supreme Command and Presidency of the Commission for the second period of 2 years.That the Italians hold it for the third period of 2 years. (2.) That an Italian officer presides over the Sub-Commission of Control, whichshould complete its task six month after ratification of the Treaty. (3.) That a British officer presides over the Sub-Commission of &quot; Special Elements,&quot;which will exist for six years. (4.) That a French officer will preside over the Sub-Commission of Gendarmeriewhich will exist for the same period. The points which remain to be settled are (1.) The status of the Allied Commander-in-Chief vis a vis the High Commissioners-(a.) During the period before ratification. (&amp;.) After ratification.(2.) Whether the presidencies of the Sub-Commissions (3) and (4) will be held in rotation for periods of two years or not.lycsr: 5th August, 1921.(9420)

a p.recis of certain extracts from the final text of the instructions drafted by the Allied Military Committee of Versailles on 22nd September, 1920.DRAFT INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE CONSTITUTION AND FUNCTIONS OF THE INTER-ALLIED COMMISSIONS OF CONTROL AND ORGANIZATION REFERRED TO IN PART V. OF THE TREATY WITH TURKEY.Duration op Duties op the Inter-Allied Commissions op Control.The duration of the operations of the Commission of Control, in so far as it functions as a Commission Of Organization is concerned, is 5 yeors, and may be-extended.The duration of its operations as a Commission of Control are limited to the complete execution of the Military clauses for which the Treaty of Peace has fixed a period of six. months.fn the event of the execution of its clauses not being completed within the time fixed, a report should be made by each Commission to the Allied Powers for decision as to the measure to be adopted. Until a decision is taken the Military Commission of Control and Organization will continue its duties of control, together with those of organization./Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control and Organization.With a view to distributing equitably between the Powers the duties and perogatives involved in the dual task of controlling the disarmament and the organization of the Turkish Armed Force, tasks which are assumed by those Powers jointly, the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control and Organization will be constituted and will function in the manner indicated below: It will comprise (1.) .1 Directing Committee entrusted with the duty of fixing the general rules and instructions to be applied, both for ensuring the disarmament and for undertaking and carrying out the organization of the Turkish Forces.(2.) Executive Organization to ensure the application of those rules and instructions.2. The Directing Committee will be formed of the three General Officers commanding respectively the British, French and Italian Forces occupying the region of the Straits, and the senior Officer of the Japanese Delegation.The Presidency of the Directing Committee will be held in turn, by the three General Officers Commanding the Allied Troops of Occupation of the Straits (British, French and Italian), in the alphabetical -order of the Powers, and for consecutive periods of X0 months. Consequently it will be entrusted to the General Officer Commanding the British Forces during the first period of 20 months, to the General Officer Commanding French Force during the following 20 months and to the General Officer Commanding the Italian Force during the third period of 20 months.The President of the Directing Committee will assume the title of &quot; President of the Military Commission of Control arid Organization.&quot;The Directing Committee will have its headquarters at Constantinople, will meet at regular intervals, and its decision will be taken by a majority vote. In tlie event of an equal division of votes, the President will &quot;have the ruling vote.2. Executive organization.

The Sub-Commission of Control of Dis-armamcnt which in principle will function only during the first period of six months following the entry into force of the Treaty. (b.) The Sub-Commission of Organization for the organization of the Ottoman Armed Force, called uponto function during the period of five years, which may be prolonged, commencing on the same date.A General or Field Officer will be placed at the head of each sub-commission, and its officers will carry the following titles : (a.) Chief of the Sub-Commission of Control. (4.) Chief of the Sub-Commission of Organization.They will take part in the Meetings of the Directing Committee in a consultative capacity. They will Le directly sub-ordinate to the President of the Commission, and will receive from him all instructions necessary for the execution of the decisions of the Directing Committee.

APPENDIX  C.Minutes of a meeting at the War Office, on the 1st November, 1920&apos;, in accordance with Foreign Office letter No. K/13488/9075/44, dated the 30th October, 1920, to consider the military details in connection with the Commission of Control and Organization.Present: Lieut.-General Sir C. H. Hauington, K.C.B., D.S.O. (in the chair).Lieut-Colonel A. Fagalde, O.M.G., H.S.O. (French Military Attache).Colonel V. Riggi, C.M.G. (Italian Military Attache).Pi I). G. Osbornk, Esq. (Foreign Office).B. H. Richardson Esq. (Q.M.G.K, Foreign Office).R. J. G. C. Patkrson. Esq. (F. 2, War Office).Lieut-Colonel W. II. Guibhon, C.M.G., C.B.E. (M.I. 2, War Office).General Harington explained the principles of his proposals, which are shown in Appendices 1 and 2, copies of which had been given to the Military Attaches on the 29th October, and the Military Attaches were asked if they had any points to bring to notice upon which it was unlikely that their Governments would agree, or which they would not feel justified in advising their Governments to accept.Colonel Fagalde said that, us regards Special &quot; Elements,&apos;&apos; he agreed that it was advisable for them to-be placed as closely as possible under the direct control of the Allied Commander-in-Chief, but that it might be considered preferable to echelon them along- the railway rather than keep them in the special zone of Constantinople, which is prohibited by the Peace Treaty. Later he agreed that it would be unavoidable that the Special Elements should bs raised in the first place in or near Constantinople.As regards the Gendarmerie, he did not think that the French Government would contribute their full quota of officers allowed by the Treaty up to the number of 88. Otherwise he was in entire agreement with the proposals.Colonel Riggi had no&apos; criticisms to offer.Neither of the Military Attaches had yet received instructions from their Governments, bit did not anticipate that any difficulty would arise.It was agreed that the 1st January would be a suitable date from which to start off the new organization in the various areas, aad that by that date each Power should have arranged to have the necessary officers on the spot.It was also agreed that the British War Office should initiate proposals for the terms of service which should be common to all Allied officers serving with the Turkish forces.Mr. Paterson explained that the terms, as effecting pensions, could not be similar for all the Allies. The British Government would require the Turkish Government to undertake certain responsibilities regarding the period of service of British officers in Turkey which would count towards pension.Colonel Fagalde pointed out that the titles &quot; Corps,&quot; &quot;Division,&quot; &amp;c, were hardly suitable to Gendar-merie.   This, however, was only a question of designation.Colonel Gribbon pointed out that no mention had been of supervising officers for the special elements ;. it would be necessary to have Allied officers specially detailed for this duty.appendix 1.1. In order to be able to proceed with a definite scheme for carrying out the military terms of the-Turkish Peace Treaty, the Army Council would be glad if they might receive definite rulings from the Foreign Office on the following points: (a.) Duration of tenure of Supreme Command and Presidency of the Commission of Organization andControl at Constantinople by a British officer.   It is represented that this should not be less than two years from the date of ratification of the Treaty. (b.) Date of commencement of tenure, though this will presumably be the date of ratification of the-Treaty, it is recommended that the Allied commander-in-Chief should take up his appointment asfrom the 1st November in anticipation of ratification of the Treaty, (c.) Acceptance by Allies of general chain of organization for the Sub-Commission of Organization,indicated on attached table, regarding which the following points should be noted.2. It is proposed that the British President of this Sub-Commission who would probably be a Major-General and would be seated in the Turkish War Office, should work directly under the Allied Commander-in-Chief without the intervention of any further Committee of Allied Generals. The latter, i.e., the Commander-n-Chief, would, in turn, be sub-ordinate to the Council of Ambassadors at Constantinople. The  ub-Oom-mission of Organization would contain a Senior Military representative of France, Italy and Japan; it is suggested that full Colonel would be a suitable rank for these representatives.3. It is proposed that the President of the Sub-Commission would ordinarily deal direct with the Turkish War Office, but in certain cases particularly in connection with the Special Elements the intervention of the Allied Commander-in-Chief would be required. It should only tie necessary for the Allied Commander-in-Chief to refer to the Council of Ambassadors in cases of difficulty with the Turkish War Office or of disagreement between the Allied representatives, which could not be dealt; with by him personally.4. It is proposed that Great Britain and the Allies should each be represented in the area with relation to the spheres laid down in the Tripartite Agreement, in which they are respectively interested with regard to the formation of the future Turkish Army, by a Senior Supervising Officer (the rank of full Colonel would
again be suitable) located at the Turkish Headquarters in the area concerned. These Senior Supervising Officers would report to the President of the Sub-Commission of Organization through their representatives on that Sub-Commission. The President of the Sub-Commission should be free to carry out occasional tours of inspection as. required/5. The above necessitates consideration of (d.) The Tripartite Agreement, under which definite spheres are allotted to France and Italy, but none to Great Britain. It is presumed that Great Britain would undertake the provision of officers for, and the supervision of the Gendarmerie in, the area from Brusa, inclusive, eastwards, opening up this area as the situation permits and may be agreed.(e.) If the above is generally agreed, the War Office would propose that in the British sphere the organi-zatiou should be on the lines of the attached table (see Appendix 5).(f.) Payment of Allied officers attached to the Turkish Gendarmerie, who will virtually be in Turkish Government employ.It will be realised that some of these Gendarmerie officers will probably be serving in a dual capacity: (i.) As Executive officers in the Turkish Gendarmerie, and (ii.) As Supervising officers under the Sub-Commission of organization,in accordance with the provision at the end of Article 159 of the Turkish. Treaty, which was inserted with a view to economy.The British Government should initiate a proposal regarding rates of payments and conditions of service which will presumably be equal for all the Allies.(g.) Distribution of Gendarmerie.The number of Gendarmerie allowed to the Turkish Government is 35,000. The War Office would propose to allot one third of this number, or say 11,500. to each of the spheres of interest. In each sphere they could be divided into such number of legions as desired by the Allied Power concerned, but in accordance with the conditions of the Treaty no legion may contain more than one quarter of the total strength, i.e., 8,500.In the British sphere the War Office would propose to organize the 11,500 Gendarmerie in two divisions or&apos; legions. It is not expected that the establishment would be filled at once, and officers could be drafted out as units were completed.The actual number&quot; of Allied officers who might be attached to the Gendarmerie in each sphere, under the provisions of the Treaty, would be 8b.(A.) As regards the Special Elements; these are different from the Gendarmerie in that no Allied officers would be attached to them, and they are a Regular reserve to the Gendarmerie to be used as required, subject to the proviso that not more than one third of the. total 15,000, i.e., 5,000 may reinforce any one Gendarmerie Legion. As it might be necessary to reinforce more than one Gendarmerie Legion or division in any one of the Allied spheres, it would not meet the case to allot these Special Elements arbitrarily in advance at 5,000 to each Allied sphere, and from the nature of this force it would appear advisable that the Allied Commander-in-Chief, in his capacity as President.of the Commission of Control and Organization, should keep these Special Elements more closely under his control than should be necessary in the case of the Gendarmerie.In cases where it was found necessary to reinforce any Gendarmerie Legion in one of the Allied spheres with Special Elements, it would probably be necessary to consult the Council of Ambassadors.Under the provisions of the Peace Treaty the Special Elements are excluded from the special zoue round Constantinople, but from the above necessity of keeping them fairly closely under the control of the Allied Commander-in-Chief, and because of the difficulty of allotting them arbitrarily to the Allied spheres, as well as administrative questions in connection with their organization, it will probably, in practice, be difficult to exclude the Special Elements from the Constantinople zone. It is, therefore, suggested that Allied agreement should be reached to ignore this particular restriction, which is contained in sub-paragraph (3) of Article 178 of the Treaty.(i.) Requisitioning questions arising-out of Article, 178, sub-paragraph 4. It is considered that the power of requisition shall be restricted to the Allied Commander-in-Chief, although each Allied General Officer Commanding should b^ responsible for his own lines of communication and for making the necessary recommendations for housing their own personnel. The Allied Commander-in-Chief would delegate his authority in this matter, as far as possible. The principle should be accepted that questions of priority affecting lines of communication shall be referred to the Allied Commander-iu-Chief.6. The question should be definitely settled as to whether the Commissions of Control are to function in the Smyrna zone which is in Greek occupation. This requires consideration of Articles 68, 69 and 89 in connectiou with Article 139, which precludes the exercise of only Turkish authority in territory detached from Turkey.7. The above does not touch upon the organization of the Sub-Commission of Control.   If any points arise which it appears may present difficulties in connection with this Sub-Commission, the War Office-propose to bring such points to the notice of the Foreign Office at an early date.War Office,8th October, 1920.

Subordinate staffs of British, French, Italian and Japanese officers, presumably including small travelling inspection staffs.(6.) Allied officers actually serving with Turkish Gendarmerie will be in service of Turkish Government, but some of these might be told off, for sake of economy, as representatives of Sub-Commission of Organization. 5(7.) According to Versailles draft Memorandum of Agreement these Generals will be Members of a Committee presided over by Commander-in-Chief, to superintend the activities of Presidents &quot; C &quot; and &quot; I).&quot;(8.) The share of each of the principal Allies may amount to over 80 officers.   It is for consideration whether the British officers should be dealt with by the M.S. Branch of - Commander-in-Chief, or whether a special section should be formed to assist President &quot; D&quot; in this connection.&apos; Note by the General Staff, War Office, dated 16M February, 1921.5 It was agreed between the French and British Governments in September, 1920, that Versailles should take no part in settling questions arising out of the establishment of the various Commissions and Sub-Commissions in Constantinople. The draft Memorandum, referred to in (7) above, was therefore, never presented to.the Council of Ambassadors, and is therefore of no effect. In the British proposals (tee Appendix Ib., paragraph 2) handed to the French and Italian Military Attaches, on 30th October, 1920, at the War Office, and which were passed by thorn to their Governments, it is definitely stated that the President of the Sub-Commission of Organization &quot; should work directly under the Allied Commander-in-Chief, without the intervention of any further Committee of Allied Generals.&quot;  The Military Attaches stated that they anticipated no objections to these proposals from their Governments.
