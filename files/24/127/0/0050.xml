[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]&apos;7Printed for the (Jabiveb.   August, 1921. secret.cp. 3 JUf 9CABINET. Afghanistan.Circulated hy the Secretary of State for India.I am afraid this is a very voluminous collection of telegrams. But in order to understand what is the present position, my colleagues need only read : (1) My telegram of 5th August, giving effect to the decision of the Cabinet, page 1.(2) The Government of India&apos;s telegram 1927 of 10th August, in reply to above, page 5.(3) Their telegram 1949 of 13th August, pages 9--10.(4) My long telegram of 16th August, page 12.(5) Their three telegrams of  the   same date, which crossed  mine, pages 15-17.It will be seen that though the suggested pis alter has come from the Afghans and not from us, thus eliminating the ;&apos; humiliation &quot; to which the Cabinet objected, the pis alter suggested is not that which we had before us on 11th May, but one involving still further surrenders. I have not yet received the Government of l.ndia&apos;s reply to my criticisms.E. S. M.India Office,. 18th August 1921.4527      100   8.21
(P. 3486)        From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign. Department,5.th August 1021.3901. Your telegrams 1828, 1829, 1843, 1850, .1.855 and 1877 were considered by the Cabinet this morning.His Majesty&apos;s Government are greatly impressed by the new factors in the case which have appeared since it was last before them.(1) As regards the local situation, they note, that after all the ups and downs which are inevitable in prolonged negotiations, Dobbs is not only able to report that the Afghans are in a chastened frame of mind, but still thinks that there is a chance of their accepting exclusive policy, or something near it, if it is pushed home with determination.(2) Meanwhile, great changes are taking place outside. The-Turkish nationalists, Avhom, doubtless, the Afghans, no less than the Indian Moslems had come to regard as the last champions of Islam, have been signally defeated, and Angora itself, which was to be the focus of the Pan-Islamic movement is threatened. If, as Dobbs reports, the Afghans were depressed by the first news of Greek victory, they will be still, more so when its magnitude and consequences are more fully appreciated, and when they realise that the Bolshevik alliance has not availed to save the Turks.(3) Rut more important, perhaps, as regards our position in the East, it is to Great Britain that the Turks are now turning for help in their extremity, and overtures have already been made to General Harington and Sir II. Rumbold, while it is Great Britain alone that has sufficient influence to restrain the Greeks.(.4) Lastly, the Bolsheviks are put out of action by a famine of enormous dimensions, with cholera and other diseases in its train, and have neither money nor troops for foreign adventure.His Majesty&apos;s Government have made no secret, not only of their preference for the exclusive treaty, but their profound objection to the pis alter on its merits, and nothing has happened to diminish their belief that its inherent defects are such as to deprive it of all value. It is true, that in my telegram of 11th May, they informed you that if in the event of negotiations for an exclusive treaty breaking down, you were to tell them that you still remain convinced that it is better to conclude such a treaty than to have no treaty at all, they would be willing to acquiesce. It is also true that in your telegrams of 15th July and 22nd July you have given the considered opinion of your Government to that effect. His Majesty&apos;s Government are keenly alive to your difficulties, political, military, and financial, on the frontier and in India. But when they consider the situation in the light of the factors meutioned above, they are constrained to say that they think that the adoption of the pis oiler at this particular juncture, would be not merely humiliating, but inexpedient and unwise. They regret, therefore, that they are unable to authorise it, and they arc of opinion, that the authority which you have given to Dobbs to negotiate on this basis should be withdrawn.Rather than acquiesce in pis aller, they would propose another alternative. They have already emphasised their objection to an arrangement which leaves the Afghans in enjoyment of subsidies from both the Bolsheviks and ourselves, and they would prefer to that a treaty as between two civilised Powers, which would provide for reciprocal right to send envoys and consuls, and for other ordinary neighbourly relations, but would involve no subsidy from us. This would, of course, leave the Bolsheviks in possession, but for the reason given above, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that danger from this source has diminished, and they are, moreover, about to make strong representations to the Soviet Government regarding the breaches of the trade agreement in Afghanistan and elsewhere. If, therefore, you think it worth while to make such a proposition to the Afghans, you are at liberty to do so. This . course would have the advantage of allowing further time to elapse, in which factors (2) and (4) would doubtless make themselves increasingly felt.Otherwise, His Majesty&apos;s Government desire, that if negotiations for exclusive treaty fail, you should refer to them again.
(P. 3528) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, S3696th August 1921.1901 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Your telegram of the 5th August, No. 3961, has been repeated to Dobbs to-day, with following instructions : &quot; You will observe that any authority which may have been given you expressly, or which you may have implied, for negotiation of pis alter treaty, is now withdrawn; and equally, you must assume that the policy of attempting to procure the proposal by Afghans for pis alter is negatived by His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot; If exclusive treaty fails, Government of-India would prefer, in the last resort, that negotiations should be opened for treaty as between two civilised Powers, without subsidy to which Secretary of State refers. In view of new factors enumerated by Secretary of State, of which Government of India are not so well aware as His Majesty&apos;s Government, there are obvious advantages in keeping negotiations open. But you should avoid committing yourself definitely, as whole position must be referred back to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the event of exclusive treaty failing. Government of India will be glad of your appreciation of the changed situation.&quot;(P 3530) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political iJepartment, 8368.Gth August 1921.1903 S. Following from Dobbs, 230 C, of 2nd August:-&quot; Rasknlnikov wrote asking me to fix the time to receive a visit from him. I replied that my health would not permit me to receive a visit.&quot; We are inclined to think that Dobbs should not rebuff the overture if repeated, but we solicit your instruction.(P. 3553) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 84348th August 1921.1909 3.   Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Dobbs, 235 C of 6th August: &quot; Tarsi proposed to have a full-dress official meeting to-day, at which (? Afghans) would announce their terms. I insisted on the meeting being private, on the ground that proposals put forward by both sides privately cannot be discussed at an official meeting without the consent of both sides. Accordingly, meeting was private. First (corrupt group) Afghan note was read out setting forth dangers and disadvantages to Afghanistan of complete rupture with Russia, and inadequacy of help offered by British in the event of Russian aggression. Tarsi then said Amir&apos;s Council had prepared absolutely final draft treaty, which we must.take or leave. They would, he said, hear no argument whatever on it. Draft treaty was then presented, and turned out to be identical with that forwarded with my Memorandum 365 K of 11th May, with the following important alterations :  &quot; Clause 2. Addition designed to shift boundary in the neighbourhood of Palosi, from the centre of Kabul river to the right bank, as already agreed upon.&quot; Clause 6. For the words &apos; of any other Government&apos; substitute the words &apos; of any Government which may be opposed to British Government.&apos;3.9(32. My telegram dated 29th July, 3831. Times Constantinople correspondent reports that Afghan ambassador at Angora at a banquet in honour of Cabinet on 31st July said that if Great Britain openly made war against Turks Afghanistan would declare Avar ; also while if it were established that British were secretly helping Greeks Afghanistan would secretly rouse tribes on Indian frontier.
&quot;Clause 13.   Whole of para. No. 2, beginning &apos; Further, &amp;c.,&apos; omitted.&quot;Clause 16. Words &apos; and its allies&apos; went out (sic). Annual subsidy (corrupt1 group) 20 i-. lakhs, (? with) initial lump sum 31 lakhs, payable on the signature of treaty., &apos; &apos; .Additional Clause. In the sentence &quot;either of two high-contracting parties&quot; ^substitute &apos; both &apos; for &apos; either.&apos;&apos; &quot; Neic additional Clause noio proposed. Our proposed proclamation to Wana Wazirs and Mahsuds putting in speciaL clause about the withdrawal of regular troops from Wano, but omits mention of right to levy light toll in kind after five years, and -also omits whole of terms 4 to 8 as set forth in your telegram of the 17th June last,-No. S83 S. to Secretary of State. It adds declaration that all the tribes of the frontier shall be excused from payment of all rifles and fines outstanding against them. Tarsi explained verbally that they demand this amnesty not only for the Wazirs and Mahsuds, but for all the frontier tribes from Chitral to South Baluchistan, including the Afridis, Orakzais, Zhob tribes, &amp;c.&quot;Tarsi pretended to be so firm that he could hear no argument of any hind ; but he condescended to answer questions regarding clause 6 and enquiries as tO&apos; clause about obligations under the League of Nations.&quot; Regarding clause 6, I asked who was to decide what Government is opposed- to the British. He replied that Afghanistan would decide on the basis of common knowledge. In any case Afghanistan could not agree to exclude Consulates of all third Powers from prohibited zone. I need not comment on absurdity of this proposal, which would leave Afghans free to have Russian or other Consulates on our frontier, whenever Afghans might choose to allege that these Powers were not opposed to British.&quot; Regarding obligation(s) under the League of Nations, I could not get Afghans to see reason. They maintained blindly (? and) obstinately that we should have no right to sever trade relations with them, even if obliged by direction of League to do so, unless and until they also have signed the Covenant.&quot; Regarding tribes, it is evidently impossible for us to enter concessions to Wazirs and Mahsuds (? point blank) in Treaty instead of in letter as proposed, and quite impossible to make concessions about fines and rifles&quot;Thus Afghan proposals are practically pis oiler, but include very objectionable features, i.e., refusal to exclude Consulates, insistence on remission of all fines and rifles outstanding for all frontier tribes, and insistence on right to import munitions in all circumstances. It would be useless and humiliating to argue further, even if Afghans wish to do so, and I propose, as soon as I know terms finally approved by the Secretary of State, to present them to Afghans in writing, and require their acceptance en bloc within 10 days, failing which I shall go.&quot; It is noteworthy that demand for assurances against Russian aggression has been dropped, because, I presume, Afghans would, under revised clause 6, not exclude Russian Consulates ; and that nothing is said about letter or undertaking regarding Turkey.&quot; I made no mention of disclosure of Treaty with Russia, but would of course do so in presenting final terms.&quot; ..Following sent Dobbs to-day :         -       * .&quot; Your 235 C, dated 6th August. Please telegraph text of Afghan note regarding dangers of rupture with Russia. It is important that Government of India and His Majesty&apos;s Government should have before them text of draft Treaty now proposed by Afghanistan. With the exception of alterations you specify, is it identical with draft.Treaty as altered at private conferences given in second column of your Memorandum 365 K., plus clauses .of original draft Treaty given in first column where the second column is left blank ? Do you consider that there is now no chance whatsoever of exclusive Treaty ? Or do you consider that Afghans may revert to it if further time is allowed to elapse in which new factors in world politics, -enumerated in the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram 3961 are developed? How far do you consider Afghans are in earnest in saying that you must take or leave their present proposals ?&quot; Secretary of State will be addressed as soon as possible regarding a recon^ sideration of His Majesty&apos;s Governments decision over the pis oiler policy, and you should carefully avoid committing yourself until you receive definite orders on the subject.&quot;
(P. 3608)        From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,lblh August 1921.4039. Afghan Mission arrived Monday. They bear two letters : (1) Autograph, from Amir to King, of which translation is as follows : &quot; (P.) The news of the lamentable decease of my father, His Majesty Si raj ul Millat wa ul din Amir Habibullah Khan, and of my accession to the throne of Afghanistan, was communicated in detail on the 29th day of the month of Rabi ulawwal A.H. 1337, corresponding with the 3rd March 1919, to His Excellency the late Viceroy of India in the hope that His Excellency might inform Your Majesty.&quot; Now considering it advisable to express the sentiments of friendship of my, Government towards Your Majesty&apos;s Government, I have sent one of my Generals, His Excellency General Muhammad Wall Khan, as&apos; Ambassador Extraordinary and Envoy Plenipotentiary, whom I have appointed to represent ray Government in ,Your; Majesty&apos;s capital. &apos; ; ...&quot; It is my desire to establish friendly relations with Your Majesty&apos;s Government,, and therefore,I hope that Your Majesty will appreciate, the friendly sincerity, of my&apos;, desire, and I trust that Your Majesty will accept my personal assurances of friendship-and esteem.&quot;      ... . -(2) From Tarsi to Foreign Ministry (sic) to same general effect.   Mahomed Wall&quot; stated that purpose of Mission is to present these letters personally to King and Lord Curzon.I had proposed to receive Mission to-day and to arrange audience of King-to-morrow, but they declined after much argument with Pears to have relations with me. Mahomed Wali regretted that, owing to precise nature of his instructions, he could not present TarsTs letter to anyone but. Lord Curzon, or Amir&apos;s letter to King through anyone but Lord Curzon. In course of argument, he gave as one reason that Secretary of State for India is part of the Government of India, and Afghans wished to appeal from them to Foreign Office. Other members indicated that real purpose of Mission&apos;s visit was to establish direct relations with Foreign Office, and that if they had known that invitation emanated from India Office they wordd not have accej)ted it.Thus matters rest until I can have views of Prime Minister and Lord Curzon, who are in Paris. Meanwhile, please telegraph your views. You are aware that His Majesty&apos;s Government have all along objected to direct relations between Afghan envoy and Foreign Office, and I think their objection will be strengthened by uncon-concealed intention of Afghans to rise these relations in order to playoff one office against another.It appears that Mahomed Wali is intended to be permanent envoy here. But until treaty is signed Afghans are not entitled to keep permanent envoy here, and in any case agremcnt of His Majesty&apos;s Government to Mahomed Wali has not been sought.1912 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Following from Dobbs, No. 237 0., of 7th August: &quot; Continuation of my telegram of Oth August, 235. In clause 14 of the Afghan draft substitute : &quot;First, for passage &apos; To punish persons, &amp;c, (? clown to) British Empire,&apos;&quot; (? amended) &apos; and to abstain itself from every kind of propaganda against the British Government.&apos;    *:&quot;Secondly, for last two lines, following: &apos; All kinds of propaganda against Government of Afghanistan.&apos;&quot; From remarks made by Afghans from time to tiine, it is clear that thisalteration is designed to permit continuance of interference of Afghans with &apos; ourtribes, prohibition of which is one of the chief objects of Treaty. I shall, therefore,, make restoration of original wording sine qua nan.&quot;
4516B1927 S.   Secret.   Afghanistan.Your telegram of the 5th August, 3961. Hopes of securing exclusive treaty-appear to be extinguished by Dobbs&apos; latest telegrams. Our one chance, and I regard it myself at this stage as a very slender one, would be for changes in Turkey and Russia to develop with such dramatic swiftness, and on such a scale, as to induce Afghans to execute complete, volte-face. Magnitude and effect of these world events His Majesty&apos;s Government are, of course, in much better position than ourselves to evaluate. But Afghans have become accustomed to cry that Bolshevism is on its last legs. As for Turkey, her straits will certainly depress Afghans, and may possibly make them pause. But unless we can dissociate ourselves from all connection with Greek successes, effect on Muslim India may be serious, and influence of Muslim India, especially when fanned by Bolshevik propaganda, is a factor to be reckoned with in Afghanistan. Whole aspect of Middle East as it affects India would, it is true, be altered if Great Britain could now seize the opportunity presented by Turkish overtures publicly to assume role of peace-maker and to resume her old role of friend of Islam by throwing in her influence in favour of Turkey. But without complete and swift change in world situation, there is scarcely room for hope that Afghanistan will revert to exclusive treaty.For practical purposes, therefore, we are confronted with (1) complete rupture ;(2) treaty (without a subsidy) as between civilised nations ; and (3) pis alter.We have already endeavoured to analyse momentous reasous that make us anxious to avoid rupture, notably prospect of deterioration on frontier possibly leading to war, and the serious reaction on internal India. It must be remembered that, if Dobbs leaves without a treaty, we must then insist on Afghans evacuating Arnawai territory, and if they prove recalcitrant, we should be compelled to enforce our rights in the last resort by actual force.(2) would be better than nothing at all. But it would leave Afghanistan u.n-(? anchored) to us by any material inducement and exposed to daily temptation to wring subsidy out of us by stirring up frontier. It would reduce us at Kabul to subordinate position to Italy or any other Power that saw fit to enter into relations with Afghanistan, and leave Bolsheviks with their subsidy in overwhelming^?ly) predominant position and able to intrigue on the frontier and into India against us almost without check. Sole advantage -would be that door would not be finally slammed on a satisfactory settlement with Afghanistan, and consecpuently that difficulty&apos; as to Arnawai might be averted. Even so, question remains whether Afghanistan could be got to agree to so empty a sequel to long negotiations, and so complete reversal of the old financial arrangements dating from the time of Abdur Rahman. We believe it to be unlikely, particularly as it would rob her of advantage with the tribes that open rupture would give her.There remains (3). I regret that His Majesty&apos;s Government find pis alter humiliating, inexpedient and imwise, inasmuch as I have advocated it only after discussing it with my Council and after much anxious thought, and after searching-conferences with all who are capable from experience of forming views on the frontier problem. One and all are of the same opinion. Dobbs, it is true, is to certain extent exception, but his present objection to policy&apos; which he advocated and pursued at the outset, seems to spring mainly from the belief that if the Afghans refuse our generous offer under the exclusive Treaty they would not be likely to be in earnest over the pis alter. Unanimous opinion of my Council and my Military and Financial Advisers, and I may add, opinion which I myself, with no little reluctance, have deliberately formed, compel me to beg His Majesty&apos;s Government, with all deference, but with the utmost earnestness, to reconsider their decision. Of course it is His Majesty&apos;s Government who are making the Treaty and Ave must defer to their views, based as they are on more information and on wider outlook of foreign affairs than ours. We must, in any event, bow to their decision. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on Government of India to point out that consequences externally and internally of rupture with Afghanistan would fall on India and on Indian Treasury, and we would be failing in our duty if we did not express considered opinion that these consequences would be grave. Our specific recommendation with regard to details of pis alter will follow as soon as possible.
G(P. 3636) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 8536llth August 3 921. 3 936 S.   Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Dobbs :  First.   234 0., dated 6th August:--&quot; Mission post-bag closed 30th July alleged by Afghans to have been swept away by flood, near Jelalabad. It contained paraphrase of my telegrams Nor. 225 and 226 C, (? and) some decyphers of Afghan B.J.&apos;s, but nothing else compromising. Have sent Fennell to investigate scene of occurrence. I fear that Afghan story is false, and they have probably seized the bag in the hope of securing my comments on important meeting of 30th July. Tarsi has announced that he will communicate final decision of Afghans at meeting to-morrow.&quot;Second.   239 O, dated 8th August : &quot;Fennell found no trace of the flood at spot where bag was said to have been swept away, aud questioned sowar, who had been reported at point of death from injuries. He was quite uninjured. Bridge was intact, and whole story obviously false. Nevertheless, Afghan officials on spot, and sowar himself, persisted in story. On FennelFs return yesterday result of his enquiries becoming known to Afghans, Tarsi sent word he wanted to see Acheson this morning. On Acheson&apos;s arrival at Foreign Office, Tarsi admitted that (? whole) story was false, and showed x\cheson Written report accepting the sowar&apos;s second statement (first statement having been false story of flood). Second statement was to the effect that band of men had overpowered sowar on the road and seized the bag. Sowar gathered that leader of band was called Abdur llahim, and heard him give orders that seal of bag must not be broken. Tarsi said the matter was very serious, and he was determined to vindicate good name of Foreign Office. There were, he said, other parties in Afghanistan determined to make bad blood between British and Afghans, and he hinted that robbery must have been arranged by such a party. He had made a formal and insistent complaint against Post Office to the Amir in person, and desired me to know that he wished me to consider him joint complainant with myself.&quot; I fear there can be no doubt now that bag was seized (? with) connivance of Amir or Nadir Khan, and that our post has been read. Fact that leader ordered seal to be kept.intact shows that it was to be produced before Afghan officials. Tarsi was, of course, forced to throw up the sponge as a consequence of our prompt investigation, and has chosen cunning way of attempting to avoid charge of&apos; monstrous breach Of diplomatic privilege. Acheson told him that the only way he could suggest of appeasing me would be to secure delivery of the bag into my hands with, the seal intact. Grave aspect, of course, is that when Afghans have thrown off the principles of civilisation in one matter of diplomatic privilege they may easily take some further serious step and plead that it was engineered by hostile party in the State. Unfortunately, greater part of your telegram of the 6th August, 1900 S., is un-intelligible, so I have not full knowledge of position under latest orders. Meanwhile, I have informed Tarsi that all negotiations are suspended until T have had time to consider what action I shall take on the postal incident.&quot;Though Tarsi professes himself indignant at the robbery by anti-British party, there seems to be little moral doubt that Afghan Government inspired it. To break off with Afghanistan on this ground, publicly stated, would be to put us in the very position we are trying to avoid, viz., open rupture, with the serious disadvantage that we could produce no proof, and. that Afghan Government would issue denial, with plausible (? explanation) backed by confession of some man or men, possibly quite innocent, whom they would select as scapegoats and suitably punish. ,Our best plan seems to be to make the most we can out of the incident and use it both for delay as Dobbs suggests, in order to give time to new world factors to develop, and for display of righteous indignation and exercise of pressure for acceptance of our terms.I suggest that it would be useful if you were to send me a telegram, couched in a form suitable for Dobbs to show it to Afghans, expatiating from the Foreign Office point of view on the enormity and barbarity of the incident, and taking most serious view of the consequences that may be forced upon us as a civilised Government.
From Vicerou, Foreign and Political Department, -     8626IZth August 1921.1947 S.   Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Dobbs, 242 C, dated 9th August, delayed in transmission :  &quot;In continuation of my telegram of the 8th August. 240, para. 1. Regarding chances of exclusive treaty, suspension of negotiations, owing to admitted and deliberate robbery of our post, gives a dignified excuse for delay, during which we -can see whether new factors mentioned by Secretary of State affect Afghan attitude. It might be worth while to wait, say a fortnight, for this purpose, but no more. Robbery of diplomatic post will now enable us to take up strong position with the1940 B. Secret. Afghanistan. Following&quot; telegram from Dobbs, 240 0., dated -8th August : &quot; Following is slightly compressed text Afghan note of 6th August :  &quot; &apos; Referring to my note of 28th June.(vide my telegram of the 28th June, 190 C), note says:   Many of  your statements are reasonable.    No doubt friendship of Afghanistan for Britain is important for the peace of frontier and security of India -and attracting Islamic feeling of Moslems to good intentions of British.   Although you admit friendship of Afghanistan, is step towards reconciliation between Britain and Moslems it is slow step.    As set off against acquisition of this friendship, Afghanistan  suffers   from  severance  relations   and   enmity  of   Bolsheviks   and all nations of East, because yon say that you cannot place any reliance on firm friendship of Afghanistan unless her relations with  Russia are severed.   When once Afghanistan, through friendship with British, creates  at  her side deadly enemy like  Bolsheviks, latter cannot make open  attack, but will  adopt many measures, troublesome to Afghanistan, on our frontiers, which are devoid of arms and force.   The advantages of Afghanistan in trans-Qxuts- territory and promise positively denied her regarding freedom of Bokhara and Khiva, and restoration of usurped territory like Kushk will be lost, and our trust in the eyes of the allies of the Bolsheviks, many of whom have a (? spiritual) relation with Afghanistan, will cease. Greatest difficulty of all is that such a matter being contrary to basic conditions of independence of my Government, renders illusory alleged generosity of your offers and their fulfilment.   From your statement, it appears greatest danger from Bolshevik arms and propaganda is over and. Bolsheviks are near annihilation.   Nothing could he better than this.   Thus it is no longer necessary to acquire strong friendship of Afghanistan, and why do you take so much trouble and put us to such difficulties. Since the return of our mission from Mussoorie, Afghan line of policy has been to observe complete neutrality and prevent harm passing through (? Bolshevik) territory to two neighbouring countries, as well as securing (? advantages) from both sides. When this difficulty was stated to Bolshevik Minister, notwithstanding charge(s) of wickedness and mischief brought against them, he, with very good intentions, agreed, and in return offered restoration of usurped territory by way of compensation.   As a -consequence of the Mussoorie discussion, hopes were entertained (? for the) advance-ment of this advantageous policy.   Now the question has taken another shape and you have made your firm friendship dependent on enmity with the Bolsheviks for defence against which you have come forward with iiliberality, miscalling it generosity.&quot; &apos; (? Now), since according to your statement no danger remains for you from Bolsheviks, I place this draft treaty before you, which does no harm to British Government and it does not bring my Government face to face with difficulties which are contrary to the wish of all the humane world. It is the result of decision of His Majesty&apos;s Council. We see no better way than this. We fully hope that you will have no disagreement with this (? draft treaty) and will sign it. If it is not accepted, Afghanistan has no idea of quarrels and war with Europeans, more especially with its neighbours.&apos;&quot; Replies to other questions in your telegram follow. I have had great difficulties owing to illness of my translating staff.&quot;
Afghans, and threaten them with, the judgment of the civilized world, that they are-(? commonly) unlit for comity of nations. In addition. I believe there might be even now faint chance of exclusive Treaty, if we could go some way towards meeting-Afghan wishes about ammunition for rifles. Afghans showed themselves extra-ordinarily upset at our refusal to give more than 2l)0 rounds per rifle, and Abdul fladi, at our first meeting (? after his) return, said, this refusal alone had convinced him that we were not in earnest in our promise of support. All Afghan repre-sentatives constantly clamoured that 200 rounds would barely suffice for one seasou&apos;s target practice, and would be shot away in one day&apos;s real fighting, and I believe this refusal was one of the turning points in our negotiations. In my telegram of the 21st June last, 181,&quot; I said I feared Afghans would not be satisfied with less than 1,000 rounds, but this request was so imperatively refused in your telegram of the 25th June last, 940, and your refusal was so warmly approved by the Secretary of State, in his telegram of 28th June, 3229, that it seemed useless to reiterate my request. In consideration of progress (sic) now reached, would Government of India be prepared to revise their views, and authorise me to feel my way towards offering-100 rounds per rifle at once, 400 shortly afterwards, and additional 500 spreading over a fixed period? This [and] when combined with every possible exploitation in Indian newspapers within the next fortnight, of outside events favourable to Mnsalmans, gives the only chance that I now see of securing exclusive treaty. But Afghans may by now have committed themselves too far in opposite direction.&quot; 2. My own impression is that Afghans, except in the improbable event of their being tempted and (? shepherd)ed back to the exclusive policy in the manner outlined above, seem unlikely in their present mood, and on present lines, to yield to request for-&quot; (a) Disclosure of treaty Avith Russia, which step they choose to think contrary to their independence.   T do not see how we can abandon this vital point.&quot;(6) Exclusion of Consulate^? s omitted) of all third Power(? s omitted) from (? Eastern) zone. I understood from Tarsi they might agree to give us letter saying that, for so long as Russian Government is based on Communism, they will consider it as being opposed to British, and their Consulate(? s omitted) excluded under their draft clause. But they categorically stated that they would not consent to exclude Bokharan or Anatolian Consulate(? s omitted) which would, of course, work for Bolsheviks, and the whole arrangement would be illusory, as Afghans could, in-present circumstances in Russia at any moment declare that Russia had abandoned Communism, (? that) our trade relations show that she is not (? really) opposed to us,, and that Russian Consulate must consequently be allowed under the treaty.&quot; (c) Remission of all Government rifles and fines, at least to Zakka Khel and Waziristan tribes.   Old obstinacy about this seems to have revived.&apos;&apos;(d) Absolute promise to allow importation of arms in all circumstances short of actual war between ourselves and Afghanistan, regardless of our prior obligation under Arms Traffic Convention and Covenant of the League of Nations. To argue with them on this point, which one would have thought obvious, is to run one&apos;s head against stone wall. They attach primary importance to arms question. To obtain exclusive treaty, we might have slurred over point about Arms Traffic Convention,, temporarily, but we do not seem justified in doing so now, in view of para. No. 3 of Secretary of State&apos;s telegram of 18th May, 2525.&quot; (e) Undertaking under clause 14 to abstain from interference with our tribes and from political or religious propaganda in India. Amir has never abandoned his desire, strongly pressed at the meeting of 17th April, to be allowed by the specific provision of the treaty or supplementary letter to continue the allowances to our tribesmen, summon them to durbars and grant them Khilats, vide sentence fifth from the end of Part 2 of my telegram of the 1.8th April, 94. Though he does not now openly insist on this he will not, I believe, consent to pledge himself specifically not to interfere.

Secret. Afghanistan. Spontaneous proposal of the Afghans for a pis oiler treaty has placed them in the very position into which we wished Dobbs to manoeuvre them. Rejection of our exclusive terms has been made in language which, though free from actual discourtesy, seems to leave no loophole for return to the exclusive treaty. Amir evidently feels that his consistent parade of Afghan indepen-dence would render acceptance of the exclusive treaty too great a uanger to his popularity, and even his throne. Proposals Afghans now put forward contain no doubt some objectionable matter. Nevertheless, they are pressing on us a treaty of friendship with us, which cannot be palatable to the Russians. Comparison with their &quot; absolutely final&quot; proposals of 4th April (vide Dobbs&apos; 81 C, dated 5th April, read with No. 157, Afghan series), shows that they have made a big climb down, notably as regards the subsidy and initial sum, and their pretensions over Arnawai, Tandesar and Turkish treaty.4516 cpropaganda under (e). My opinion to the contrary is strong, and I wish to take full responsibility for it (? full stop). I posted yesterday my proposed draft treaty on pis-allar lines, which 1 had intended in the last resort to suggest that Afghans should .be told to take or leave, en bloc.&quot; 4. I am primd facie much attracted, in view of recent developments, by the idea of simple friendship without subsidy, which (? climlv) emerges from your corrupt telegram of 6th August (? 1900).&quot;5. Your enquiries as to precise text of latest Afghan draft treaty are answered by immediately following telegram.&quot;Our comments follow.
Our view is that Dobbs should work as..far as possible on the basis of their proposals, confining his alterations to essentials, and then place before the Afghans.a treaty we are prepared to accept.   To take Afghan proposals seriatim : Clause 2. Suggested additions may stand. It has already been agreed that that minor boundary alteration is unobjectionable.Clause 0. We are disposed to believe that, while Afghans recognise that we&apos; insist on the exclusion of the Russian Consulates from Eastern zone, they abject&quot;-to present wording as infringing Afghanistau&apos;s sovereignty. Wording they propose is ambiguous, perhaps even purposely so. Yet all the world knows that Russia, at any rate in Afghanistan, is a Government opposed to the British Government. Hence we might accept Afghan wording, provided that Afghans give us a safeguard of a supple-mentary letter admitting that Russia is a Government opposed to the British Government, and cannot, therefore, have Consulates in the Eastern zone. If Afghan redraft is bond fide, and if ambiguous language is introduced only for the purpose of protecting Afghan istafts independence in the public eye, they would have no excuse for demurring. ..   ...Clause 13. Omission may be accepted. It is probably dictated by Afghan Governments habitual mistrust of dealings between their subordinate officials and our frontier officers.Clause 14. Redraft may be accepted (? despite) omission of specific undertaking to abstain from all interference with the tribes, which figures in Diirand Agreement, but was never operative. Undertaking to abstain from every kind of propaganda against us is wider than original, and whole clause is more definite than anything we have secured under former treaties.Clause 16. Omission Of the words &quot;and its allies&quot;&apos; may be accepted. We anticipated Afghan objection in mv telegram of the 21st dune, 912 S. We still prefer increase of subsidy to the payment of lump sum down, for we regard subsidy as our real means of securing Afghanistan^ observance of treaty. On the one (? other,), hand we doubt whether it would be wise to press this too &quot;far, as the Amir is clearly in need of ready money for the payment of his discontented army and the general stabilising of his position. Moreover, Dobbs has already communicated to the Afghans offer of an initial grant apparently of 36 lakhs under a pis alter treaty (vide His.telegram 106 O, dated 29th April). We recommend, therefore, that Dobbs, while not contesting Afghan proposals, should give them option of increased subsidy of 25 lakhs, together with telegraph material to- Kabul and. on to Kandahar, estimated cost of which olelivered on the frontier is about 41- lakhs. If absolutely necessary for extinction of initial grant he might go up to, but not beyond, 30 lakhs.Old Additional Clause. Afghan wording is, of course, impossible.. Their apprehensions that concession granted under our treaty may be at any moment withdrawn, owing to general obligation incurred by us in connection with League of Nations, are intelligible enough. Yet we see nothing for it but for Dobbs to try to bring them to reason. He might give them an undertaking that we will not (? allow) covenant or convention to interfere with free Afghan imports if we can possibly help it, and further (should His Majesty&apos;s Government see no objection), that we are prepared to submit any dispute to the League of Nations.New Additional Clause proposed by Afghans must be ruled out summarily. First: We cannot incorporate face-saver over the tribes in treaty, and Dobbs should explain that to overload it with such, petty and irrelevant details would make it ridiculous as an international instrument. Second,: Face-saver must be confined to Waziristan only, where alone we have been forced into military operations, and Dobbs should absolutely decline to discuss our domestic relations with tribes outside. Third: Face-saver should be restricted to Dobbs&apos; preamble (vide his 454 C, dated 5th June), and to proposed Waziristan announcement (vide our telegram of the 17th June, SS3 S.), with Afghan omission, which will not fetter our future action, plus undertaking to replace regulars at Wana by Khassadars. In Dobbs&apos; preamble words &quot; with whom Government of India have just completed Treaty of friendship,&quot; should be inserted after &quot; Amir of Afghanistan.&quot; Dobbs should absolutely decline to discuss remission of fines or rifles. Fourth: Face-saver should be given after the actual conclusion of Treaty in form of a letter from Dobbs, to effect that, to mark a new era of friendship and peace on the conclusion of Treaty of friendship with Afghanistan, Government of India have decided to make an announcement of generous policy to tribes ofjWaziristan, of which he (? feels) it only right to apprise Afghan Government.
From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 14t/z August 1921.     S7141957 S. Our telegram of the 13th August, 1948 S, repeating Dobbs&apos; 243 C. If it is decided to resume pis aller negotiations none of the Afghan alterations seem to us objectionable enough in substance to be Avorth contesting.1955 S. My telegram of the 13th August, 1947 S, repeating Dobbs&apos; 242 C. We cannot bring ourselves to believe that increased offer of ammunition could possibly have turned the scale, but we recommend that Dobbs should have discretion to utilise this extra inducement if he thinks worthwhile at this stage. Our Military advisers agree. He might make an opportunity for so doing by taxing Tarsi with the meaning of &quot; liberality, miscalled generosity,&quot; in the Afghan note of 6th August.As regards points in the pis aller on which Dobbs thinks Afghans will not yield : (A) We agree with Dobbs and. Muspratt that Afghans in their present mood may refuse a point-blank request for disclosure of Russian Treaty, as an impairment of sovereignty without any reciprocal obligation on us. But Dobbs should demand whether text as already published is identical with final text, and if so, how the two treaties can be reconciled. Unless Consulates clause 5 has been modified, Afghans will presumably contend that reservation contained in note to clause, regarding manner and time of actual opening of Consulates, gives them power to postpone their establishment sine die, and they intend to exercise it. If so, Dobbs in an interchange of notes on the Consular case should state categorically, that the establishment of any Russian Consulate in prohibited zone would constitute definite breach of our treaty, and entail immediate stoppage of subsidy and other concessions under it. As regards secret clauses, Ave have throughout had to face probability that Afghans would produce for our consumption, bowdlerised version, authenticity of Avhich Ave should not be in a position to question. Our best course, therefore, is to demand a definite written assurance from the Amir that they contain nothing directed against us.(B) Tarsi&apos;s offer to give us a letter excluding Russian Government from Eastern zone, so long as it is based on Communism,, points to inclination on the part of Afghans to meet us over the Eastern Consulates question, and seems to show that they are chiefly exercised over the wording- of the clause. If that is so, we do not anticipate Dobbs Avill have any serious difficulty in getting the sort of letter out of Tarsi we have suggested. We should in any case restrict ourselves to exclusion of Russian Consulates only. Even under exclusive treaty chance of our being able to exclude Turkey appears to us extremely slight. As for Bokhara, Jalalabad lies on the great trade route from Bokhara to Peshawar, and to insist on excluding&apos;Bokharan Consulates from Jalalabad, at any rate, would be obviously unreasonable.(C) We have nothing to add to our recommendation on the tribal face-saver.(D) This is a point of real difficulty, for the Afghans are confronted Avith the possibility of our concession regarding import of arms, &amp;c, being suddenly rendered null and void by some general obligation under the League of Nations. We should be grateful for His Majesty&apos;s Governments assistance in getting round this difficulty. They will realise that stoppage of imports through India will drive Afghanistan to secure those imports through undesirable Russian channels. This is a point on which Afghans feel very strongly, and on Avhich it is necessary to allay their suspicions.(E) Our recommendations stand. If the definite clause in Durand&apos;s agreement against interfering with our tribes did not stop either Abdur Rahman or Habibulla from presenting khilats and allowances to our tribesmen, no clause, however Avorded, Avould stop Amanulla. As regards propaganda, Afghan objection to Avord &quot; religious &quot; Avas a foregone conclusion, and their Avider undertaking is sufficient.(F) Has been dealt with in our former telegram.
From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, With August 1921.Clear the line. &apos;4177; Afghanistan. Your telegrams of I I tlx to 14th August, .1.927, 1936, 1940, 1948, 1949, 1955, and 1957.I understand your wish to be that I should now ask Cabinet to approve pis alter treaty. 1. should have less difficulty in doing so if treaty now proposed did not differ so widely and for the worse from that in which Mis Ma&apos;jesfcy&apos;s Government were ready to acquiesce, however reluctantly, on 1.1th May. At the outset lam confronted by the difficulty caused by the Afghan outrage on Dobbs&apos; mail. I cannot anticipate judgment of my colleagues on this, hut it may have salutary effect on Afghans if Dobbs hints to them possibility that His Majesty&apos;s Government may decline to negotiate further with a Government which, while basing huge claims on its presumed equality with civilised nations and fitness to be admitted to relations with them, then commits an outrage which if perpetrated by a civilised Power would almost certainly be followed by a rupture of relations.My second difficulty is the apparent indifference with which your Government, regard the offence in respect both of its inherent enormity and of the light which it throws on Afghan good faith and trustworthiness. If Cabinet ever felt any degree of confidence in Afghan intention honestly to carry out terms of treaty, that confidence will assuredly be rudely shaken and the value of any treaty greatly diminished which depends for its effectiveness on Afghan good faith.Coming now to amended draft, I cannot hold out any hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government will abandon demand for disclosure of Bolshevik treaty, which they consider essential solely as test of sorely discredited Afghan  good  faith quite irrespective of value of matter disclosed.   If it is not worth Afghans&apos; while to give this evidence in order to secure all. the advantages of British friendship, I can have no confidence in their good faith in observing pis alter treaty.   Up to this moment I had every right to assume that you agreed with this view.   Second, as regards consulates, clause as now drafted and as Dobbs tells us that it will be interpreted by Afghans -seems to me to afford no safeguard whatever, and certainly not to be worth paying for. Yet to drop it would be to acknowledge defeat.   I cannot, seriously offer Cabinet your defence of Bokharan consulate at Jalalabad where it has never before been suggested that Bokharan interests justified representation, and T assume that you would not admit a Bokharan Consul at Peshawar.   Again, if Afghans are willing to give us a ; letter about Russia-either they believe that they can get Bolshevik treaty altered, whereas we know that Soviet have instructed Raskolnikof to press for establishment of consulates generally, though without specifying these in particular; or else Afghans intend to violate Bolshevik treaty, which does not inspire confidence in their honesty. The argument about infringement of independence is palpably absurd, but&apos;if Afghans press it they might be asked how they reconcile independence with the receipt of a subsidy.   Third, as regards subsidy, I observe that you are disposed to increase it, although present proposals give less in return than any yet. made.   I appreciate value of hold which subsidy gives, but it seems to me that if Afghans are not deterred from breaking treaty by loss of 20 lakhs they will not be deterred by loss of Zo.Next, regarding tribes, disappearance after duration of 30 years of Afghan undertaking to abstain from interference, presents greatest difficulty of all. It cannot fail to be known all over the frontier and to be represented as admission of that kind of double allegiance which it is our policy to prevent. This must involve deplorable loss of prestige which cannot make for peace and will tend to perpetuate very conditions which whole object of treaty is to terminate. Abstention from propaganda is another question altogether and no compensation for this omission.Undertaking was a weapon always available for use if required, and fact that it did not always suit us to use it is no justification for throwing- it away.Proviso regarding Arms Convention is essential, and I fear I cannot suggest any means of mitigating it except to impress on Amir that he can secure all the advantages of the Convention by himself adhering to it, which does not involve membership of League of Nations. To give assurance such as you propose would make it appear to the world that we intended to evade Convention if we possibly could.I have no desire to add to your difficulties, but it is only fair to you that I should communicate to you the obvious criticisms of your proposals. I do not underestimate disadvantages of a breakdown, but I am not convinced that they are as great as you
apprehend. For example, as regards Arnawai. The Afghans have been in occupation for some years; why should it be imperative to eject them until it is convenient to us to do so ?With the material now before them, His- i\Iajosty&apos;s Government would unhesitatingly prefer their own alternative treaty without subsidy. 1 note that you consider that this would place us in inferior position to Italy, but J. do not understand why. It seems to me that geographical and economic conditions must always give India predominance.

Following from Dobbs, 244 C, dated 10th August :-&quot; Your telegram of the 6th August, 19 (sic), conveying Secretary of Slate&apos;s telegram of 5th August, has now been decyphered. In my telegram of the 9th August, I have given appreciation of. present situation, and my opinion that there is still faint chance of, securing exclusive treaty if we offer 1,000 rounds per rifle. Failing this, I have explained that Afghans own form of pis alter treaty is quite unacceptable, and that I do not believe that they will accept the only form which we could put forward, and of which I have submitted a draft by post, but if my estimate of situation is correct, it seems doubtful whether there would be any advantage in placing it before Afghans.&quot; 2. There remains alternative of ordinary treaty without subsidy.   I suggest -that it should be as follows: Clauses referred to being those (corrupt group) my Memorandum (? No.) 366, and words &apos; British Government&apos; being substituted for the words &apos; Great Britain &apos; wherever they occur.&quot; Clause 1. (I.F.O.C.C. 1906 begins.) &apos; The British Government accepts and certifies all rights of internal and external independence of Afghanistan.&apos; (I.F.O.C.C. 1906 ends.)&quot; Comments. It is derogatory to Great Britain that Afghanistan should explicitly recognise definition (sic) of independence. If Afghanistan wishes us explicitly to recognise hers, we will do so.   Otherwise clause can be expunged.&quot; Clause 2. Add provisions for shifting of boundary set forth in telegrams of 6th August and 9th August, 235 and 243. (&apos;? It) seems necessary in order to secure (? peaceful) retrocession of Arnawai.&quot; Clause 3. See my telegram 235.

Omitting Herat and adding (I.F.O.C.C. 1906 begins) : &apos; in the event of the Afghan Government desiring at anytime to appoint Consular officers in any British territories other than India, a separate agreement shall be drawn up to provide for such appointments, if they are approved by British Government.&apos; (I.F.O.C.C. 1906 ends.)   See Secretary of State&apos;s telegram of 1.8th June, 3034.&quot; Clause 5. Second column unchanged.&quot; Clause 6. Omit. Our pose is to be that circumstances have now so completely changed that Eastern Consulates can be ignored.&quot; Clauses 7, 8 and 9. (? Substitute) one general clause, (I.F.O.C.C. 1906 begins.) &apos; The British Government agree to grant to Government of Afghanistan such facilities for transport through India from British ports in India to Afghanistan of goods of all descriptions, including munitions and military stores, as may be convenient, from time to time, and may not be inconsistent with provisions of Arms Traffic Convention, and also to grants of rebate of Customs duties upon such goods which may be obligatory under any Convention on freedom of transit which may be adopted by League of Nations and be entered into by the British Government.&apos; (I.F.O.C.C. 1906 ends.)&quot; Comments. There is no reason why, when we are getting nothing out of Afghanistan, we should guarantee unhindered importation of arms in all circuin-stances, and I do not think in the case of landlocked countries, such as Switzerland 4516 D
or Czeelio-Slovalda, any special and definite facilities for transit of goods otherwise than by river tire usually given by neighbouring countries other than facilities which (V Transit) Convention may now make obligatory.

We cannot accept draft which they have put forward, which is, neither one;.thing,nor the, other, and would, in. our opinion, put us in considerable obligation., without any .adequate quid pro quo.&quot;In the event of our having to fall back in final resort on a treaty without a subsidy, lines Dobbs suggests seem print a, -facie. suitable, but we have not examined/his proposals in detail.(Pi.; 36S3) From Vnccroij, Foreign and Political.

(P. 8749) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 88111Gth August 1921.(Received .1.7th, 10 a.m.)Clear the line.1,976 S. Following from Dobbs. First. 247 C, dated 13th August :W I have to-day posted drafts of exclusive treaty, with supplementary letters, increasing our offer to 1,000 rounds of ammunition per rifle, and of alternative to ordinary treaty, together with Memorandum, of which following is summary : &quot; 1. If exclusive treaty is discussed again, I hope I may be given discretion to modify wording of supplementary letters, on the understanding that essential conditions shall not be altered.&quot; 2. If these two alternative treaties are placed before the Afghans simultaneously, it is just possible, on the one hand, that additional rounds of ammunition may over balance their hesitation to accept severed relations with Russia.   On the other hand, they will not like the alternative treaty giving them no subsidy, no unconditional pledge regarding transport of arms, no Customs concessions except under Transit Convention, and whittling down face-saver formula for tribes.   Worst of all, they will appear to the world subject to almost exclusive dependence on tottering Russian Government. But they will have no valid excuse for objecting to treaty which treats them as ordinary civilised neighbouring Power.   We should not have same apparent hold over them as under treaty giving subsidy, but in (? reality) our hold might be greater, since threats to treat with severity any breach of neighbourly relations and Obtentation of comparative indifference might have -greater effect than treaty which shows that we are ready to pay heavily for Afghan friendship.   There is a fair chance that Afghanistan, confronted with choice between these two treaties, may choose exclusive one, saving her face by the excuse that additional ammunition renders it more attractive than before.   Summary ends.   I would add that I believe Afghans would prefer ordinary treaty to rupture, since they are certainly not ready for war, and would   do  much to avoid having Russian Minister in predominant position at -Kabul.&quot;&quot; Second.   250 C, dated 14th August :--&quot;Kabul newspaper of yesterday announces that 2nd and 3rd of August, three days before our last meeting, Afghan Ministers and leading men, under presidency of the Amir, discussed important affairs. Paper professes not to have received accurate intelligence, but concludes : &quot;(I.F.O.C.C. 1906 begins) : &quot;We hear that a treaty was forinulated and signed between our Government and the Communist Government of Russia, and we will also in the near future publish it in exact form.&apos;   (I.F.O.C.C. 1906 ends.)&quot; This is tantamount to a declaration that a Russian treaty of some kind has been finally ratified. Question is whether treaty ratified is original, or newly modified treaty. Primd facie, there wpulcj hardly have been time for a newly modified treaty to have been ratified by Russia, unless7 Raskolnikov has been authorised by wireless from Moscow, to amend and ratify. Use of wireless for this purpose seems unlikely in view of past occurrences. There-is possibility therefore that original treaty, with 4516 E(Received 2 p.m.)Clear the line.1971 S.   Second and last part.&quot; Problem is not easy. It would seem difficult at this stage to take up attitude which would deny Afghans right of any independent nation to introduction to the King, through the Foreign Office. Could not this be justifiably construed by Afghans as a going back on our recognition of Afghanistan&apos;s full independence ?-Of course, had this (sic ? their) object been discussion of matters primarily affecting India it would have been correct for us to take rigid stand, both on past practice and projected treaty, and insist on dealings with India Office alone. But as the Mission&apos;s object is announcement of Amir&apos;s accession, would it not be better for India Office to introduce the Mission with due formality to Foreign Office ? &quot;
provision for Eastern Consulates, has been ratified, and that Afghans at last meeting intended to mislead us by revised wording of clause 6, and subsequently to interpret it as not prohibiting Russian Consulates. If so, both exclusive and pis alter treaty seems now out of court, and the preparation for the form of treaty still possible would be ordinary treaty. In any case, doubt on this point must affect our whole policy and tactics here, and I recommend that I should now officially ask Tarsi, with reference to this announcement, whether treaty with Russia has been ratified or not, and, if so, what are its contents, as we cannot shape our policy in connection with our4incomplete negotiations without knowledge on this point. If he refuses there seems nothing for it but for us to leave at once, or to put forward ordinary treaty without modifications and fix time limit.&quot;Our comments follow.(P. 374-9) From Viceroy, Foreign and Polidtnl Department, 881016t/i August 1921..   (Received 17th, 10 a.rn.)Clear the line.Secret. Afghanistan. Reference my immediately preceding telegram. As we said in our telegram of the 14th August, 1955 S., if increased offer of ammunition, or indeed any reasonable concession could possibly turn the scale in favour of exclusive treaty, Dobbs should be empowered to make it. Announcement in semi-official Kabul newspaper, however, seems to rule exclusive treaty finally out of court. We have, already sent Dobbs following instructions : &quot; Your 250 C. of 14th August. You should at once address Tarsi as suggested regarding contents of the Russian Treaty, with reference to announcement in Afghan newspaper, and report the result.&quot;Our views upon inadequacy of a gentlemanly (sic) treaty, except in so far as it does not absolutely debar relations with Afghanistan, have been already set before His Majesty&apos;s Government. If offered such a treaty, Afghans would almost certainly protest, taking their stand on professed basis of present negotiations, viz., Mussoorie aide-memoire, under which we offered a subsidy, &amp;c, in consideration of Afghans agreeing to certain undertakings now reproduced in substance in clause 14 of present Afghan offer. Even were Afghans willing to accept a gentlemanly (sic) treaty, we are sceptical of ostentatious indifference on our part giving us a hold over them. We have tried those tactics from Rawalpindi Treaty onward, without success, and see no likelihood of our meeting with more success in the future. Recent disclosures of Afghan diplomatic methods do not lead us to place reliance on any treaty with them, which does not promise them payment of money for the observance of treaty, and confirms us in our view that it is only a treaty, with payment of a subsidy, which will have any chance of observance by Afghans, lie viewing the situation in the light of fresh events-post-bag incidents, ratification (which we assume) of the Russian Treaty, and the general attitude of Tarsi (? and the) Afghan Government throughout more recent period we are still convinced that, in this difficult and unpleasant situation, we should place our pis alter treaty for adoption or rejection before the Afghans, with all clauses we intend-to insist upon, and in language we choose. We should confine our offer to what is actually essential to guarantee the future. As the Afghans are now to receive Russian gold, they will not be in pressing need of ready money, and we now think that we should rule out the initial sum of 31 lakhs, and. should confine our promise of subsidy to 20J lakhs. If they want our friendship, whether as a counterpoise against Russians, or otherwise, and if they understand that our offers have been cut down in view of their procrastination and duplicity, and how in their absolutely final form we believe they will accept them. If, however, they attempt to insert wording we have already advised should be rejected, there remains nothing save gentlemanly (sic) treaty you have suggested. Advantage of such a treaty, in the last resort, is that it may enable us to arrange friendly terms of Afghan evacuation of Arnawai, instead of having to make a (? word omitted) if demand (?ed omitted) which may quickly have to (? become an) ultimatum. But we cannot believe that such a treaty would lead to peace and tranquillity on the frontier, or enable us to economise one rupee of the very large expenditure we are now incurring daily.

Following telegram has been received from Dobbs, 251 C, dated 15th August: &quot; Russian Treaty having been apparently ratified, there is no longer any reason for delay to await external developments since these cannot affect Afghans&apos; decision. I trust, therefore, that 1 may be authorised to act at the earliest moment, and that orders will be absolutely final and leave no scope for bargaining. I anticipate that Afghans will almost immediately publish non-secret clauses of the Treaty, and will either refuse to communicate or deny the existence of any secret clauses or supplementary promises. Yet we know these exist, for the Afghans have in private meetings admitted Russian promises of munitions and aeroplanes. Presumably, I shall make disclosure of the promises regarding these latter at least the sine qua non. If there are others we do not know them, though it seems almost certain Russia must have promised support against British attack, and possible that there may be both offensive and defensive alliance.&quot;We think that Dobbs should demand disclosure of the secret clauses, and, if their existence is denied, tax Tarsi with his own admission of Russian promises of munitions and aeroplanes. But, as matter provides open field for prevarication (vide our telegram of the I4th August, 1955 S.), we do not think disclosure should be made a sine qua non. Nevertheless, though we have no faith whatever in Afghan asseveration, written or verbal, we still think that Dobbs should insist, for appearances sake, on written assurance that there is nothing in any supplementary agreement under the Russian Treaty directed against us.
