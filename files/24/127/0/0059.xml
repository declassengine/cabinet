S DOCUBNT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)323SECRET. 3258..0 A B I B E I. IRELAND.yoREPLY RECEIVED PROM MR. de Translation).      VALERA - 25th August, 1921.DUBLIN,Mansion House, August 24, 1921.The Right Hon. David Lloyd George, 10 Downing Street, Whitehall, London.Sirs-The antlolpatory Judgment I gave in ray reply of August 10th has be on confirmed.   I laid the proposals of your Government before DAIL EIREANN, and, by an unanimous vote, it has rejected them.From your letter of August 15th it was clear that the principle we were asked to accept was that the &quot;geographical propin^5lty,, of Ireland to Britain imposed the condition of the subordination of ireland s right to britain s strategic interests as she conceives them, and that the very length and persistence of the efforts made in the past to compel Ireland&apos;a acquiescence in a foreign domination Imposed tho condition of acceptance of that domination now.We cannot believe that your Government intended to commit Itself to a principle of sheer militarism destructive of international morality and fatal to the world1s peace.      If a small nation&apos;s right to independence is forfeit when a more powerful neighbour covets its territory for the military or other advantages it is supposed to confer, there is an end to liberty.      No longer oan any small h^tion claim a right to a separate sovereign existence.Holland
t.324Holland and I)enmric^oan&apos; T^-made^-irabeervlent to Germany, Belgium to Germany or to France, Portugal to Spain.     If nations that have been forcibly annexed to employes lose thereby their title to independence, there can be for them no rebirth to freedom.        In Ireland^ case, to speak of her seceding from a partnership she has not acoepted, or from an allegiance which she has not undertaken to render, is fundamentally false, just as the claim to subordinate her independence to British strategy is fundamentally unjust.   To neither can we, as the representatives of the nation, lend countenance.If our refusal to betray our nation&apos;s honour and the trust that has been reposed in us is to be made an issue of war by Great Britain, we deplore it.       We are as conscious ef our responsibilities to the living as we are mindful of principle or of our obligations to the hendo dead.   We have not sought war, nor do we seek war, but if war be made upon us we must defend ourselves and shall do so, confident that whether our defence be successful or unsuccessful no body of representative Irishmen or Irishwomen will ever propose to the nation the surrender of its birthright.We long te end the conflict between Britain and Ireland.     If your Government be determined to impose its will upon us by force and, antecedent to negotiation, to insist upon conditions that involve a surrender of our whole national position and make negotiation a mockery, the responsibility for the continuance of the conflict rests upon you.. On the basis of the broad guiding principle of government by the consent of the governed, peace can be secured - a peace that will be $ust and honourable to all, and fruitful of concord and enduring amity.     To negotiate such a peace, DAIL EIREAKIT is ready to appoint its representa-tives, and, if your Government accepts the principleproposed
