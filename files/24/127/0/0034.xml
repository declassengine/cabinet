..WORK WHICH RBUIBS 10 BB CARRIED OUT/The results as given in Part 1 of fcbi&amp; Report oan -not be considered either complete or final. A.   They are not complete. .1*   The situation as regards the disbandment of the Self-Defence (Selbstschutz) Defence Organisations, remains obscure.   Germany has declared these organisations dissolved, but has not yet provided a list, and in consequence the control of the abolition of these units is made very difficult.   In particular, the Societies affiliated to the &quot;ORGBSCR&quot; have not been enumerated. Consequently, as matters stand at present, Germany can still count on a really strong reserve, thanks t* these Organisations,*which are composed of a large number of volunteers.2,   The effectives of the Police have not yet been reducedto the number fixed by the Boulogne-Notet and the Police whichare still in existence are of a military mobile character, whichis oontrary   to the decision of the Boulogne Note.   The GermanGovernment, in spite of the decisions which have been notified to them concerning this question, have asked, and still askexplanations and additional details.     In this way the, time is prolonged during which the Police form an additional body,equal in strength to the Reichsheer, capable of forming cadresof officers and41, CO&apos;8 to the reserves of volunteers.3.   The transformation of i factories to commercial usesis still delayed under various pretexts and thus the possibleproduction of war material remains a danger,4,   The control of the delivery wf material declared by theGerman Government is not finished.   This wark is carried out .at 200 centres of destruction and 300 Depots of material, which does not include Units of the Army and Police formations which are even more numerous.&amp; Of a total &quot;of 7000 factories Which are known at present to have, manufactured war material, 2000 remain to be. visited; 5000&quot;have been visited or are about to be visited, but in the case of a few of the more important factories, the necessary destruction will not be accomplished before the end of 1922&apos;y...- 4 -
5,   Mcrewcr, it is impossible to rely entirely on the material declared by the German Government, and the Interallied Military Commission of Control has not yet been able to obtain the original or basic details (Lists showing the armaments at the time cf the armistice), which are*indispensable in order tc arrive at the degree cf disarmament which has been obtained as regards material,6,   ( Finally, tho delivery and ieatruoticn of certain materials (wagons, bridging material, field bakeries, etc.) are obviously incomplete,B,   The resume&apos; which is given below and which ojUy covers the essential points shows that the results obtained are still incomplete,   These results are however i-nly temporary and they will remain temporary, even when the above mentioned shortcoming have been rectified for the following reasons1.     The Self Defence (Selbstschutz) units which have been dissolved can be easily reconstituted, if a strict control is not for a sufficient time, maintained/  The Reichsheer and the police can carry out militaryinstruction for a large number tf volunteers by means offalsifying leave returns and returns cf men discharged.   Thusnot only can the existing reserves continue, but they can increase,2.     The German Government has tried up to the present tokeep under a civil heading the largest possible number ofofficers and military officials, and to leave   in the Central -Administration and to the auxiliary services the minimum cadresnecessary for mobilisation.   The examination of a normal budgetwhich cannot be done until 1922 (the budget of 1921 being stillabnormal), wou^d help to ascertain whether the German Governmentwere-keeping to their legal organisations.   This is a point which should be emphasised.
3.    War material oan be increased fairly quickly, firstly by manufacture, and secondly by means cf importation.It will consequently be necessary to sot up a control organisation that will last for some considerable time,Ixsm the preceding brief summary of the situation the following conclusion has been reached;The Inter-Allied Military Missicn of Control in Germany has not yet completed its task.   As regards the date cf the complete execution of its work, na definite forecast oan yet be jaade.   On the one hand, it is neoessary to take into account the goodwill or otherwise cf the German Government Whose attitude has for the last eighteen months varied considerably, and, quite recently, after having been satisfactory for sike time with good results, again shows signs of reaction. On the other hand, vide the above statement, the original statements (lists of armament 6f November 1918) have not yet been supplied, and consequently it is not possible to form an exact f-pinion as tp the complete nature of the surrenders of material which have been made,
FART     III.Proposals.In th^Hsye^J^it^^ it is r&amp;ftm&amp;s&amp;e&amp;i(1)   T c allot/ the1 Int er-Allied- Military   Gcmmi^^31 c^ Control in Germany to continue the execution if its duASBS^ on the understanding that this Cc^m^n will oajrvyvtmt progressive reductions of personnel ih^waaeiiKi^ situation.   It is intended ts reduoe the vSub^ftimxiflfdcm... of P&amp;rtifi cat ions (20 officers) &quot;by 50$ by next Nevember, and te&apos; dissolve it in January 1922.A censiderable reduction (at least 50 officers cut of 169) oan be carried tiut in the Armaments&apos;Sub^(k5mm&amp;miA&amp;. by January, 1922.Further reductions are contemplated, but can OMly be carried out if the German Gtrvemment assist? in the complete and loyal execution sf the Treaty.   Ho exact details can be given at the present time .(2)   To hasten the execution &apos;of the military clauses cfythe Peace Treaty by reminding the German&apos; Government af the engagements which it has already given.(3)   In these circumstances it seems at the present time premature to lay down the exact method in which the future control of the military execution of 1jhe Treaty will be carried out.Each delegate now adheres to the opinion which has been expressed (on behalf of his country) on the question of aeronautical cftntrcl, with a view to adopting a similar method for the future control of the execution of the military terms fif the Treaty, when the time has arrived for this to be done.

NOTE AS REGARDS THE NAVAL CLAUSES OF THE PEACE TREATY.



1. The Commission of Control itself will propose at the moment when the clauses of the Treaty, the decision of the Supreme Council and of the Conference of Ambassadors will be carried out that the Commission should be gradually reduced.



2. The reductions will be carried out in such a way that each country will have one representative on the Commision so that each country can guarantee that their part of the control is effective.



3. The Commission of Control will be dissolved when the conditions of disarmament for Germany laid down by the Treaty by the decisions of the Supreme Council and by the Conference of Ambassadors have been carried out.



4. After the execution of the clauses of di?mament as given above the experts propose to maintain a reduced Commission to ensure that Germany does not break the conditions which have been imposed on her. The British Naval Expert considers that this Commission should reside permanently outside Germany and that it will not go into Germany except to make investigations. The French Naval Expert considers, on the other hand, that this Commission should reside in Germany. The Italian and Japanese Naval Experts consider that this decision has a political character and they will not give any opinion on this subject.
