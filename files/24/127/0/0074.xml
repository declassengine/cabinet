FRANCEM.Sarraut, the Colonial Minister-, has decided to make an extensive tour of the French African possessions.       He proposes to sail in a cruiser from Dakar about the end of September and visit Senegal, French Guinea, the Ivory Coast, Togoland, Dahomey and the Camsroons,. The French gunboat &quot;Doudart de la Gree&quot; has been wrecked on the rocks in the Yangtso   River, whilst making her way to Patung from Ichang to Invest.!gate a case of bandits firing on a steamer which was flying the French flag,SPAINThe Cruiser &quot;Reina Regente&quot; is in the Arsenal at Cadiz,     Preparations are being made for her cruise to the North of Spain to embark the Naval Cadets from the &quot;Carlos V&quot; and &quot;Pelayo&quot; for an instructional cruise to the ports of Northern Europe,TURKEY.Two British destroyers recently carried out a cruise to Northern Anatolian Black Sea Ports to obtain Information regarding Greek and Bolshevik activities &amp;c*Various ports wore visited and the conclusions come to as a result of the cruise were that Great Britain is considered as hostile to the Nationalist Turks , and even if our declara-tion of neutrality has been heard of,^it is not believed,, There is, undoubtedly, discrimination between the British and the French and Italians.     The attitude to H.M.Ships is politely correct, but no landing was allowed, except at Sinope,If Russia is shipping munitions to Turkey (Nationalist), they are probably conveyed in motor caiques to Trebizond,No fresh mines appear to have been laid.No signs of Greek activity were seen..,DANUBEThe Danube Flotilla arrived at Bratislava, on its way upstream, on 2nd August,No events of note marked the visit, save a very noticeable display of coolness on the part of the French mili-tar-y officers at Brat i a leva, and it was impossible not to receive the impression th&amp;u they resented the visit.
FART II... GENERAL INTELLIGENCE. PERSIA.,  Instructions have been sent that the South Persian Rifles are to be entirely disbanded.     The Prime Minister is evidently making no effort to give a pro-british^dlrect^ion. to affairs, and while profossing friendliness to U3 is cd-operating with demagogic and pro-Russian elements,SYRIAl!he Pan-Arab movement for a united Syria, Palestine and Mesopotamia is weakening.     In the north of Syria the feeling is strongly in favour of uniting again with the Turks and the Sherifian movement both in Syria and Palestine has lost- -ground in favour of a tendency to local. self-government and an eventual federation of some sort tinder Turkey,.     Generally speaking, there is a revulsion of feeling toward Turkey, as since the Turks were driven out, the condition of the people has not improved.     In any case the Turks are brother Moslems,The native Arabs, disgitsted with the treatment they have received from England and Francej, and having lost confidence in their ability to found and maintain a new kingdom, again look to their old master the Turk as a saviour from French domination on one side and Anglo^Slonlsm on the other,FINLAND.No anxiety is felt at Helsingfoj?s regarding the despatch by the Bolsheviks of four armed trainsNand a numbar of armoured cars to the Russo-Finnlsh frontier,    ,Prepare.-Uions&quot;have, however^., been made to reOtiSt a possible Inroad 9LITHUANIASwitzerland recognised Lithuania &quot;de Jure&quot; on 21st August 1921,     This is the first country other than Russia to grant &quot;de Jure&quot; recognition.     It is reported in the press that Lithuania has!renewed her request f&amp;r admission to the League of Nations,RUSSIAAn agreement was signed between Russia and the American Famine Relief Organisation on 20th August 1921,     The Soviet Government will be represented on central and local committees.The BoJshevik gold reserve is dlm5,nlsMjog 0     On 15th July it was stated that they had in hand 37 million gold roubles and about 4 tons of platinumsReports indicate that Trotsky&apos;s influence is diminishing. By nature Trotsky is inclined towards the War Party and his attitude clashes with Lenin&apos;3 new policy of compromlso.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;    &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Reports Indicate risings in the Zangezur$ Karabagh, and Btekhichovan districts.     The hill tribes in Eagheatan contin-ually interrupt Bolshevik lines of communication,germany the murder of Herr Matthias Er-sberger on the 26th August created a great sensation in Germany,     Erafcerger belonged to the Centre party end was finance mini site?.1 for about 6 months, but latterly had been working mostly behind the scenes and was said to be exerting a strong influence on the present Wirth Government.In the Weimar Assembly he advocated the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.
TURKEY.Greek Operations.&quot; Generalliar ington reported on the 19th August that theTurks had effected a go del piece of work in concentrating in the Polatil-Inlar-Katranji areas and ccald now defend Angora stubbornly or quickly qithdraw .     This concentration had saved Kemal&apos;s army for the time being.Information received from a recent source states that the Turks v;ere prepare! bo accept battle between the Sakharia river and Angora.     The Greek front line strength was estimated on the 21st August at 40,000 rifles.     On this date the Greeks had not crossed the Sakharia River north of its junction with tho Pursati River.     Turkish Headquarters anticipated they would endeavour to cross on the 23rd, at the same time renewing their main attack in tho South.The Greek objective is to turn the Nationalists&apos; left flank.    Prophecy is dangerous, but there is information to show that the enemy will put up a stubborn resistance, and that&quot;the greeks gill have to fight for Angora.     The Nationalist Govern-ment hawithdrawn to Kaiseria, and tho population are being quietly withdrawn to the interior.     The town is surrounded by a good system of entrenchments.The Greeks appear to have given up the idea of using Iamid as a base, as the bridges between Geive and Bilejik would take 6 months to repair at very heavy cost.JUGO SLAviAThe evacuation of the Jugo Slav forces from the Baronya district of Hungary is not proceeding altogether satisfactorily. The attitude of the Jugo Slav Government is correct, but local commanders are in some cases adopting an obstructive attitude.PANAMAThe Government of Panama has announced that it is prepared in principle to resist encroachment by force of arms, but in view of notification from the United States that she will not permit Panama to have resource to arms, Panama has decided to evacuate the region of Coto in dispute.
