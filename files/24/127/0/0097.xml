I&apos;X&apos;KIB DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GO VERNMENT.SECRET.CP.3293CABINETSUPPLY &amp; TRANSPORT COMMITTEE.ORGANISATION AND WORK OF THE MINES DEPARTMENT DURING THE COAL STOPPAGE.I circulate a detailed report showing the organisation and work of the Mines Department during the recent Goal Stoppage.S *B *12th September, 19 21.BOARD OF TRADE.
Organ!organisation and Work of the Mines Department during tho Coal Stoppage.I attach a detailed report shewirg the organisation and the work of the Mines Department during tho last coal stoppage.The main differences botween the last stoppageand those which preceded it in which Government action was taken were:-(l)    the length of tho last stoppage,(2)    the addition to the duties of the Departmentof the importation of coal and disposal&apos;of imported coal.As regards (1) the stoppage lasted 94- days and was certainly the longest general coal stoppage of modern times.   Although the Mines Department&apos;s estimate of the endurance of the Country was optimistic I think everybody was surprised that during a stoppage of such duration practically no cases of serious hardship due to want of fuel came to notice.   Various causes contributed to this,  such as tho slump in industry, the abnormal weather, the energetic action of Local Authorities and others in providing substitute fuels, and the disinclination of the Country as a whole to be excited over what was going on.While stocks at the beginning of the stoppage were not good the consumption was reducod very rapidly and the policy of not attempting to regulate prices
except through the voluntary .action of the trade organisations undoubtedly stimulated-economy in non-Bumption and greatly facilitated the handing ovor of fuel from ono person or concern to another.Tho brunt of the work in connection with the stoppago fell upon tho Mines Department and the whole of tho organisation functioned well, such coal as was available hoing hold with a tight hand and distributed/ according to priority noods.   Such weaknosses in tho organisation   as were found wore due mainly to the fact that tho stoppage began just at the momont that the steps takon to do-control the coal trade had resulted in depriving the Department of the assistance of its paid outdoor staff and before there had been time to instruct and train the voluntary substitutes for that staff.   none the less the absence of complaint and of serious hardship indicates that the work was satisfac-&quot; satisfactorily done, although of course the staff of the Department was subjoctod to very sovero pressure during the whole of tho stoppage,LiaiBon with other Departments was adequate and I havo to thank the othor Departments for thoir assistance during tho Emergency.Financially the most expensive item of the Emergency work is the loss, roughly estimated at  1,000,000 incurred on imported coal.   This was of course unavoidable as the decision to import was taken as an insurance against a national breakdown, and coal had to be bought several weeks ahead of consumption. This meant that as soon as it appeared that production in Great Britain was to recommence, the Government
were left with foreign coal on band which oould only be disposed of at a heavy loss,I should like to express my high appreciation of tho indefatigable energy and skill with which these operations wero carried out by the members of my staff and the numerous volunteers who came to our assistance - and especially of the work of Mr. Poley undor whooo direction the various funotions of the organisation   wero carried out - and of Sir John Hindley who from the outset placed his valuable Imowlodge and experience freely at the disposal of my Department and devoted the whole of his time to the assistanoo of my staff throughout the emergency *(S5d.)

COAL   MINES    STOPPAGE.Is^ Apr11/4th jwy, 193,1.Action, taken by the Mines Department and the Coal Sub-Committee during the Emergency.1.      INTRODUCTION.The Miners ceased work on 3.1st March and a state of Emergency was proclaimed by His Majesty the King on 1st april.1 1921, and the Emergency Powers Act rendered effective.     The Miners returned to work on 4th July, 1921 after a stoppage of 94 days.2.      STOCKS AVAILABLE-The following summary shows the stocks of coal estimated to have existed in the country and at ports when the stoppage occurred,(a) Colliery Stocks.    The estimated quantity of coal at Collieries (in truck and on pitfoank) was 5,900,000 tons but of this a considerable portion was not fit for consumption.(b) In Transit.     By rail and other means of transport for all purposes 875,000 tons.(c) Household Qo&amp;l*     It was not possible to prepare a r e ITabl e &quot;estimato of the quantity of coal in house-holders1 cellars, but it was reported by the Merchants to be above the average for the Spring period.     The tonnage held by Coal Merchants for household purposes, was equivalent to 2 to 3 weeks1 normal supply.(d) Stocks at Public Utility Undertakings.     A total of 2,708^000 tons Was in stock, equivalent in the case of(i) Gas Works to 5-1 weeks&apos; normal consumption(ii) Electricity Works to 7 weeks&apos; normal   &quot;(iii) Water Works to      weeks&apos; normal consumption.(e) Railway Stocks.      1,100,000 tons equivalent to 4. weeks1 stocks on a normal basis of consumption was in the possession of Railway Companies,(f) Industries.      The quantity held was  estimated to be 2,350,000 tons, sufficient for three weeks1 working although unevenly distributed amongst industries throughout the country,(g) At Ports, in dock areas in course of shipment abroad&quot;, or in snips.Approximately 562,000 tons.
The stocks of coal at the commencement of the stoppage were generally less than at the beginning of the Miners&apos; Strike -   in October, 1920,  especially as regards Publio Utility Under-takings, Railways and.Goal merchants.     This was due partly to the fact that a number of these services had relaxed their efforts to build up stocks after the expiration of Government Control of distribution, and partly to the normal seasonal drop in stocks.      Some works held quantities only sufficient for one week&apos;s consumption.On the other hand, of course, the general slump in trade and the approach of the summer, lessened the possibilityof serioua breakdowns owing to shortages of fuel.3.      EMERGENCY ARRANGEMENTS TO CONSERVE AND DISTRIBUTE AVAILABLE STIPPTT%3T--------(a)   Organisation to deal with the Emergency.In accordance with the deoision of the Supply and Transport Committee (T.O. 23rd Cons. 16th February, 1921) the Mines Department had already framed an Emergency organisation which could operate all over the country at short notice, decontrol having swept away the ordinary organisation whichhad been available to deal with previous emergencies,c&apos;Broadly speaking, the Emergency organisation was based on close oo-operation betweon Local Authorities and the Coal Trade Associations, e.g. Coalowners1 Associations, Coal Merchants&apos; Federation and National Council of Coal Traders -in carrying out, under the guidance of the Mines Department, the policy and Directions of the Government so far as detailed distribution and conservation of existing supplies were con-cerned.     Committees of Colliery Owners, Factors and Consumers were made responsible for dealing with stocks of coal in Colliery premises and other Committees of Coal and Shipping representatives and Government officials, dealt with coal at
ports in dock areas and in ships which would normally have gone abroad but which was made available for inland needs.Details of the Organisation are shown in Appendix &quot;A&quot;.(b)    Action taken to conserve and distribute:(1) Coal for Bunkers and Export.Upon the declaration of the Emergency by His Majesty the King, the local Shipping Emergency Committees (see appendix &quot;A&quot;) were brought into action and the following measures based on tho powers conforrcd on Departments by the Emergency Powers Act, were ordered to be taken to all Ports and sub-Ports:-Refuse Bunkers/ and refuse or withdraw clearance in respect of all British ships in his port or ports (but should not interfere with loading)Refuse Permission to load and suspend loading of coal cargoes and both coal and oil fuel bunkers on board all foreign   ships (but 3hould not refuse clearance)Refuse Permission to discharge to any collier the discharge of which had not commenced.Provided always that the following classes of vesselsmay be dealt with exceptionally :-All oil-burning vessels irrespective of nationality may be cleared and supplied with oil fuel bunkers provided they have not shipped,  and do not propose shipping, a coal cargo;Minimum bunkers may be allowed to salvage vessels actually engaged in salving ships and not merely working at a wreck, Trinity House vessels attending Lighthouses and Light Ships, Pilot stoam boats, British tugs (except sea-going tugs and tugs taking long trips) ferry boats and generally to all craft necessary to keep the port and lights working.Necessary bunkers may   be &quot;allowed to a British vessel not carrying coal and ?*hose service is approved for a   coastwise destination by the Local Water Transport Committee, and the vessel may proceed.     If the shippers are willing to supply bunkers from their own works stock for coastwise voyages carrying their own traffic, such bunkers may be allowed provided the particular voyage is authorised by the Water Transport Committee.The Supply of bunkers to British Pishing Vessels is to be restricted to a total quantity not exceeding 50% pf the normal requirements of the fleets at each Port.     The distribution of that restricted quantity is left to the discretion of. Looal Fishery Associations, who will advise how much bunkers may be allowed to any particular fishing vessel.     The percentage was later reduced to 25% of the normal requirements.
All British vessels loaded or loading with anthracite, or with duff for foreign destinations, may complete loading, but may neither Teunker nor clear,Foreign vessels may also be allowed to load coal cargoes (hut not bunkers) whenever there are no available British ships in port, and the refusal of permission to load would render the collieries idle (bwt not otherwise)... British vessels carrying coal coastwise (except to Ireland) may bunker for the round .and clear,     All British vessels loaded with coal for Ireland are t* be detained.Short Sea Passenger and Cargo Lines may bunker and clear within specified limits.     The services of railway steamships,  cross channel boats etc. on a restricted basis had previously been fixed.All British vessels with no coal In holds may proceed to their destination if they are not shipping coal bunkers, or if the bunkers are already on board;    but bunkers are only to be granted in specified ca3es.Necessary quantitios of coal for tho working of the ship while in port, o.g. coal for donkey boilers, and necessary quantities of coal for galley use, may be allowed to be shipped.Vessels in remote places, or places where a very occasional cargo of coal is discharged in an open roadstead, may be permitted to dischargo their coal cargoes withou^ ref erence to London, provided the Local Shipping Emergency Committee or (In the case of non-Oommittee ports) the Collector, is satisfied that such a course Is necessary for the good of the local community or the safety of the vessel.(ii) Coal for consumption inland.The organisation to doal with the situation (see Appendix &quot;A&quot;) was1 brought Into force at the Taeginning of the stoppage and predetermined instructions were sent to each individual (or body) appointed, clearly defining his duties and powers.This following Emergenoy Diroctions under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920 were issued and arrangements made for their extensive publication in the Pross :-Coal (Emergency) Directions, 1921.These Directions :Made it the duty of Looal Authorities to render their provisions effective in their districts and to control the distribution of coal by moans of permits.Prohibited the delivery of coal for households whero tho quantity available for consumption exceeded 5 owts., In other cases limiting deliveries to 1 owt. weekly.Except in special circumstances, limiting the weekly fuel consumption of industries to 50% of tho average. As an alternative, Industries were permitted to continue full working for a fortnight after the
declaration of the Emergency if not more than 50?&apos; of their stocks was consumed in that period The remaining 50fi of fuel could only be used under permit from the Local Authority.Prohibited the acquisition ofcoal by Industries.Empowered District Coal and Coke Supplies Coramlttoas to take possession of coal at pits within respective areas and direct its distribution.Gave instructions to Gas Companies regarding the economic use of coal and pressure of gas supply and limiting the supply of gas or electricity for industrial power purposes.Restricted street lighting to that necessary      * for the safety of the Public and prohibitied lighting for display or advertisement.Em-powered Local Authorities to prosecute persons infringing the Directions.Copies of those Directions are attached (Soe Appendix &quot;B&quot;Ministry of Health Statutory Rules &amp; Orders No. 44S.An Order issued to all Local Authorities imposing upon them the duty of discharging the Emergency Directions 1921 and instructing them regarding the means for meeting expenses caused in the execution of Directions.Statistics.Steps were taken to obtain particulars of all coal available, and arrangements were made for regular returns of stocks, and consumption, to be furnished as follows  ;Quantity of Coke made, consumed, and in stock at Gasworks.Stocks of Coal at Collieries and Colliery Consumption. .-Stocks of Coal at.Ports.Quant it y of .0 oa 1 imp or ted by Government and &apos; P&apos;r&quot;ivate Bnt T/cpr i&apos;g 5 T&quot;Stocks of Coal held-by Industries.Public Utility Undertakings furnished weekly returns of stocks and. cbnsumption.

Also to cancel all facilities for special and excursion trains.   Further roductions were made from time to time whioh reduced the weekly consumption of coal by Railways from 255,000 to 113,000 tons.Food Producing Industries, special list of Vital Industries prepared.&apos; &apos; *      &apos; &quot;It was found aftor the stoppage had been in operation 10 days that it would not be possible to maintain supplies of fuel to all food producing works, and, in conjunction with the Food Department, a list was issued to all Local Authorities, Food and Goal Emergency Officers, setting out the Industries which wore agreed to be those producing food vital to National Life.    Any Industries outside that list wore not to be granted permits to acquire fuel.Tho List comprised -Bakeries Flour Mills Margarine WorksMills for crushing seeds for Edible OilFin-&apos;e Salt WorksYeast Producing DistilleriesGold StoresIoe and Milk FactoriesSugar Refineries (subsequently deleted).and fuel was only allowed, in so far as these industries were producing for home consumption, not for export. Further, the Food Department on representations from the Mines -Department instructed their local officers to arrange where possible for vital food producing works to economise fuel by concentrating production in cortain works and closing down others.Special arrangements were also made for Fried Fish Shops and Eating Houses.The. above, together with Railways, Public Utility Works and Domestic Supplies constituted the &quot;Priority List&quot; of consumers, whose needs&quot;becamo the special ca:.&apos;e of the Department Further restrjUjUons of Lighting and Keating.Letters impressing the nood for economy in lighting and heating were sent to Hotels, Boarding Houses, Restaurants, Hospitals e-oco wetting put definito methods of restrictions, and Gas and Eleotrioty Companies -were asked to circularise
all their consumers on similar lines.  On 25th April a Supplementary Emergency Direction was issued requiring the quantity or Gas or Electricity used for Street Lighting to be reduced 50% subject to the discretion of the police.    The Power supplied for the running of Trams and Light Railways was also directed to be reduced to 75% of normal.Further restrictions of Supplies to Households.On 14th April it became apparent that coal could not be supplied for domestic purposes on the same scale as hitherto, and a further Direction was issued, prohibiting the delivery of coal to households except by permit of the Local Authority in special circumstances, and in those oases not more than i cwt. weekly could be allowed.Wood FuelOn the 28th April a Sub-Committee of the Coal Sub-Committee was set up to ascertain the quantity of wood fuel, ready for immediate, use, which was available, and to devise means for bringing sellers into touch with consumers. It was ascertained that the stocks of mature wood fuel available in the&apos; country were:-60,000 tons in the hands of the Government 100,000 tons in the hands of Wood Merchants, and an unlimited quantity of timber.As regards the  Government stocks, it was agreed that the Disposals Board should arrange details of sale, and all Local Authorities and Coal Emergency Officers were circularised on the subject.Arrangements were made with the Timber Merchants Association for their Branches throughout the country to be furnished with the names of Coal Emergency Officers and for Coal Emergency Officers and Local Authorities to be given information to enable them to obtain the wood nearest to their districts.Economy in coal consumption by Gas Companies.On the 4th May a Direction was Issued rendering it obligatory for Managers of Gas Works to manufacture carburetted Water Gas to the fullest possible extent and that no Coal Gas be supplied until these conditions were fulfilled.Use of Coke and Patent Fael as substitutes for Coal.At the commencement of the strike the Gas Companies generally held large stocks of Coke and it was considered desirable not to restrict export, but subsequently, owing chiefly to the large demand made upon existing stocks by Gas Companies themselves, in the manufacture . of Water Gas, by Bakeries,    Food Producing Industries and Resturants and one Railway Company for locomotive purposes, an embargo was placed upon export, and later it became necessary to put into force
a. system of permits by Local Authorities for the distribution of Coke on similar lines to that in force as regards Coal.There were large stocks of Patent Fuel in South Wales which would have been exported in ordinary course, and Electricity Undertakings and other Public Utility and Pood Producing Works were induced to use this fuel as a substituto for coal.    The South Wales Committee were also successful in removing a considerable quantity of fine slack from colliery pit banks to provide material which kept the Patent Fuel Works working full time.Those measures wore successful in saving a considerable quantity of coal for purposes for which coal only could be used.aRoloase of coal from Industrial stocks.A consus of the stocks held by industrial^iCs was taken during the first fortnight of the stoppage,  and an appeal was mado to all firms in possession of any considerable quantity of fuel to release it voluntarily for essential purposes.The responso to the appeal was very satisfactory and only in two cases was it necessary to commandeer.The Metropolitan Committee obtained 15,000 tons from Industrios and the situation was rolievod throughout the country by the generous assistance of all branches of Industry.4.      DEVELOPMENT OF THE IMPORTATION OF COAL.At the end of April the course of events showed cloarlythat work would not be resumed at the Mines for anothermonth and in spite of the steps which had already been.taken,and further   restrictions which were in course of beingimposed,  inland supplies would, not suffice to meot thovital needs of the country after the third week in May.Coal had already been Imported into the country in small quantities by private importors, but labour difficulties had developed which threatened to stop any considerable progress in this direction.It was therefore recommended by tho Supply and Transport Committee, and confirmod by the Government, that organised steps bo taken to obtain coal from abroad for vital needs.(IB)
(a)    Importation of coal by the Government.At a meeting of the Supply and Transport Committee on the 22nd April the Mines Department were authorised to make immediate arrangements for the importation of coal, subject to the authority of the President of the Board of Trade as to the actual quantities which should be imported, to meet the needs of domestic consumers, public utility undertakings, food manufacturing concerns and railways throughout the country.     The Committee further agreed that the detailed arrangements for the importation of coal, In particular the financial arrangements, should be carried out hy the Mines Department in consultation with the Finance Sub-Committee, at the same time having regard to the view of the Supply and Transport Committee that coal imported by the Government should be sold at suoh a price as would preclude loss to the Government,Steps were taken without delay to set up machinery for that purpose,     A departmental Committee known as the Goal Importation Committee was entrusted with the actual work of arranging for the purchase abroad, ^ engaging freight, and the disposal and distribution in this country of the coal imported.The functions and composition of the Committee arat shown in Appendix &quot;A&quot;, Page 19. &apos; &apos;)The first meeting of the Committee was held on the 26th April, when the Government Agents were authorised to buy coal from the Continent,   Throughout the emergency period the Committee sat daily in consultation with the Government Agents,The Committee gave detailed directions to the Agents in regard to the qualities and quantities of coal to be purchased, the arrangements to be made for freight, and as to the disposal in this country of the coal purchased.    The Committee took steps to avoid any competition among the Agents which might affect detrimentally the financial position of the Government,In regard to the distribution of imported coal, an effective liaison was established between the Coal Importation Committee and the organisation set up by the Coal Sub-Committee for inland distribution,- and by that means the satisfying of essential needs was secured.    In the main the Government Agents sold direct to the consumer, railways, public utility works, etc.    The Government Receivers were generally used at the ports to secure prompt discharge and proper disposal of the cargoes, and the Government Agents were definitely instructed to dispose of imported coal only to consumers on the Priority List,    (see Page 6);The Coal. Importation Committee furnished the Coal Sub-Committee with a daily statement of the quantity of coal purchased, the position of the coal afloat, destina-tion of cargoes, progress of discharge,etc.
(b) Importation of coal by jfoiyate, Enterprise,,,The first coal imported privately arrived during the third week&quot;in April, and up to the 30th&apos;of April, about 6,000 tons had been discharged.The fact that such coal was subject to the Emergency Regulations on arrival, and its high price, prevented any considerable quantity being shipped.    In order to encourage importation, -the Goal Sub-Committee decided, on the 14th April, to allow imported coal to be used for bunkering without restriction and on the 20th April to permit importers to dispose of the coal for inland use practically without restriction.At that period, however, labour difficulties developed at various ports, and private importers became even less disposed io take the riak of Importing coal on account of the uncertainty of being able to discharge it on its arrival at a British port.The Government thereupon decided to take the responsibility for Importing sufficient coal to meet essential needs, and from that date privately imported coal was only to be allowed to be delivered to Undertakings and Industries on the Priority List.    The Customs Authorities were also empowered to prohibit the discharge of any cargst until satisfactory particulars of its destination were forthcoming.Action on these &apos; lines was continued until the end of the stoppage.   Appendix &quot;0&quot; shows the amount of coal imported by Government and by private enterprise, the Railway Companies being the principal purchases of coal imported on private account,(o)   Labour difficulties,,The first sympathetic action by the Transport Workers Federation on behalf of the Miners was taken by Glasgow dockers during the last week in April when they refused to unload South Wales coal consigned to the Caledonian Railway Company,   A similar course was adopted on the 3rd May by Transport workers at Newcastle and Manchester. On the 5th May the Executive of the Transport Workers Federation issued an Order to members of the Union forbidding them to discharge cargoes of imported coal and that was followed on the 7th May by a decision of the
Hallway Workers Exeoutive to refuse to transport ooal from ports.    These instructions were not observed by all members of the Union, but work was stopped in the Thames and, Clyde end partially at some smaller ports.   At Liverpool and Southampton work proceeded normally when It was made clear to the workers that coal imported by Government Agents could be consigned only to Undertakings and Industries essential to the life of the community&apos;.Steps were taken at&apos;Glasgow and in. the Thames and elsewhere to recruit volunteer labour and to protect them if necessary.   Unloading recommenced, slowly but the rate increased rapidly as the volunteers became efficient, the daily tonnage discharged rising from 5,000 to 15,000 tons between the 7th. and the 21st Hay, -   The Railway Companies, with the exception of the&apos; London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company, experienced no serious difficulty with their men   &apos; and were able to move the coal to its destinations.It is an amusing sidelight on the situation that at Glasgow, miners -volunteered to take the place of transport workers, who had sti-uck out of sympathy for the miners.On the 24th May the Union Executives decided that imported coal for essential purposes could be handled by its members, and the regular labour had returned to work by the 26th May*Except for spasmodic outbreaks no further difficulties occurred.5. GENERAL POSITION TIT THE COUNTRY LURII1G THB STOPPAGE.    &apos;(a)   Supplies and Distribution.The stocks available in the country on April 1st are shewn on Page 1 and it was estimated that on an emergency basis they would suffice to meet&apos;the essential needs of the country for four weeks.Owing to the measures taken for conservation, and the wide publicity given to the need for economy in the use of fuel, no serious difficulties arose in the country during AprilsA detailed survey of the position taken on the 25th April showed that it was possible, by making full use of ooal substitutes, to maintain public services and meet the demands of food producing industries and households up to the 9th May, but at about that time serious shortages would exist in various parts of the country unless further drastic restrictions were imposed, or coal were brought in from abroad.
Statements are attaohed (Appendices &quot;O&quot; and &quot;E&quot; Pages 36 and 37) showing the depletion of the stocks of public utility undertakings and railways and the percentage of decrease in consumption at various dates throughout the stoppage.By the end of April the majority of the industries consuming fuel had closed down or were on short time, and coal for domestic use was only being supplied at. the-rate of     cwt. per week in oases of sickness  . or where no alternative means for cooking was available.    Public lighting was reduoed by 50$ and the consumption of coal by railways showed a decrease of 37^.In view ef the critical position which existed in the country at the beginning of May, a small Sub-Committee was appointed by the Supply and Transport Committee consisting of Sir George Beharrel (Ministry of Transport), Mr. E.J. Foley (Mines Department) and Mr, CE. Penny (Pood Department) to review the situation and to prepare for the Cabinet each week a budget or forecast for the forthcoming 3 or 4 weeks, and to consider the question of drastic further cuts in consumption.   On the 30th April that Committee estimated that, with further restrictions on the lines of those already taken, the consumption of coal throughout the oountry would be reduced to 607,000 tons weekly.   Appendix F shows how this quantity was made up and also contains estimates for weeks subsequent to 28th May.   On that basis of consumption the supplies available by the 28th May would amount to a total reserve in the country of 1,793,000 tons, i.e. less than 3 weeks reduoed supplies.   By the 28th May the rate of the import of coal would be increased sufficiently to maintain the balance and, from the suppliea point of view, the situation would be of a less serious nature. The Supply and Transport Committee directed that efforts should be made to ensure that on the return of the men to xiork a quantity representing not less than 2 weeks consumption of coal on the basis of 607,000 tons should be available.In addition to the coal stocks stated there existed 600,000 tons of coke, 160,000 tons of mature wood fuel, unlimited quantities of timber, and considerable quantities of patent fuel.    Coal was also being produced from &quot;outcrops&quot; in sufficient quantities to relieve many shortages in colliery areas and industrial distriots.These alternative types of fuel were fully exploited and it was found that the position at the end of May was better than had been anticipated, 2,280,000 tons of coal being available in the country at that date. Government imported coal was arriving at the rate of about 150,000 tons weekly.All the means by which economy in consumption could be effected had been made use of during the .f,irstx two months of the stoppage, and stocks of coke had decreased so rapidly, espocially in the Metropolitan Area, that a system of rationing of that fuel had to be introduced in order that bakers and similar food industries could be provided for.
/During the May period- whan the situation was most critical, owing to labour difficulties in unloading &apos; imported ooal, and the exhaustion of home produced&apos;stocks, the rural districts subsisted largely on wood fuel. The main problem concerned the Metropolitan Area, the Midland Industrial Area, and Lancashire and Yorkshire.London was fortunate in possessing large stocks of coke which were invaluable in meeting the needs of bakers and restaurants, and, as the cooking in households was mainly done by gas, the supply of imported coal to the large Gas Companies relieved the position in that respect.In the Midland, North Lancashire and Yorkshire districts, the minors were prevailed upon to permit the withdrawal of large quantities of slack from pit banks. In addition several thousands of tons were produced from &quot;outcrops&quot; especially in Staffordshire and Yorkshire and nd real danger&apos;of shortage developed in those areas, which might, in certain circumstances, have caused considerable difficulty.    In many districts the miners themselves fetched coal* frcm outcrops &amp;c. and sold it to household consumers.The transport workers at Liverpool did not object to discharging imported coal and, in -this area, the essential needs were met&apos;throughout the emergency without great difficulty.During June all vital needs were met by Imported coal and its high price was in Itself a decisive factor in ensuring every possible economy in its use.In spite of the drastic restrictions imposed, few serious complaints of shortage were received which could not be relieved at once.    No important Public Utility Undertaking closed down owing to lack of fuel and a full supply of food was maintained throughout the country.The extensive publicity given to all Eegulations and the need for their imposition, and the loyal co-operation of all Local Authorities and Goal Trade Representatives, together with the patriotic aotioaa. of firms and individuals in giving up ooal for their less fortunate neighbours were, to a large extent, instrumental, in&apos;providing fuel for the preparation and cooking of food.   The fine wsather and the long hours of daylight also greatly&quot;reduoed the demands for fuel for lighting and heating.Co)   Prices.The Secretary for Mines was given&quot;powers under the Regulations of the Emergency Powers Act, to control prices, but the Ooal Sub-Committee decided not to use them unless unreasonable advantage were taken of the position by traders.The Coal Merchants1 Federation, tho National Council of Coal Traders and the Mining Association circularised their members urging the necessity for
the restriction of prices without government intervention, and the Coal Traders generally agreed to charge the rate of profit authorised during the period in which control was in existence.A few cases ox alleged prof iteerin    came to light but, generally speaking, the advice of the headquarters of the various Federations was acted upon and the prices of coal did not rise unreasonably, while the fact that prices were not directly controlled greatly facilitated transfers of fuel from one holder to another.GENERAL REMARKS - WBA3M533B3. ( a)    General.The Organisation devised to deal with the - conditions arising out of the Emergency was found to meet the demands of the situation satisfactorily, although put into ferce hurriedly and consisting largely of voluntary -workers whom there was no time to train in the duties hitherto performed by paid officials,    The arrangements made for liaison between the various Comraitteos and officials shewed an improvement on those in foroo during last year&apos;s strike and the duties of each part of the organisation were cloarly defined and understood.The Emergency Regulations provided adequate powers far all the steps taken and, so far as can be seen, will be suffioiont to meet any contingency likely to arise *(b)   Weaknesses.All the headquarters Committees performed the work for which they were appointed satisfactorily and their canatitutions, with the exception of the Central Coal Emergency Committee, could not be improved upon.The Central 0.sal Emergency Committee was intended to be composed of representatives of the C&apos;:al Trade generally., but owing tr. the leading coal owners being fully occupied cither in their own Districts or on negotiating Committees in London, the meetings were attended (with one or two exceptions) by London Coal Merchants and Factors, (who, while they&quot; represented the Coal Trade for the whole of Great Britain, had practical experience mainly of London problems)  and representatives of the Mines Department inly. The Committee was fortunate in having an experienced and efficient Secretary and a competent oxecutive staff and did not fail in its object, but it would be more satisfactory if the Committee itself were representative       provincial coal interests, and especially of coalowners.     The difficulty is that the responsible provincial men cannot come to London for the meetings.It is hoped this difficulty can be overceme in the next emergency.
Coal Emergonoy Of floors.Whilst Coal Emergency Of floors generallj? were successful in dealing with the situation in their areas it was found that they did not in all cases realise the importance or scope of their duties and were apt to confine their activities to that branch of the coal trade in which they worked normally.     In certain districts also there were misunderstandings and disputes between the local Authorities and the Coal Emergency Officers owing to the problem of supplies jsnd distribution being studied from different standpoints.It is realised, however, that whilst tho Coal Emergency Offioer (in the majority of cases a Coal Merchant), finds it difficult, owing to his business interests, to take a sufficiently comprehensive view of the position, he can, in virtue of his occupation and local knowledge, be of great assistance to tha Department in Areas where the merchants stocks form the main factor in the situation.Local Authorities organised their districts exceptionally well during the emergency and in view of their efficiency and experience in past strikes, it is desirable to strengthen this side of the organisation.It is proposed in future to arrange for:(a) The appointment of officials, acquaintedboth with the Coal Trade and with the Department&apos;s organisation, to take up duty in tha office of the Civil Commissioner in the chief areas on tho outbreak of a strike.    These officials would do liaison work for the Civil Commissioner ensuring that he is linked up with the Mines Department organisation and would advise him and Local Authorities in the area.   Each would need one or two assistants.(b) Local Authorities will, be expected and stimulatedto supervise the work of supply and distribution in their areas, with the advice and assistance of the local Committees of the Coal Trade and of selected members of that Trade appointed by the Coal Merchants - Federation to act as Emergency Officers, These local Authorities and Coal Trade representatives would be linked up with the Divisional Coal Officer attached to the Civil Commissioners staff.Civil Commiasloners.The weaknesses in the Mines Department Organisation reported by the Civil Commissioners mainly concerned the efficiency of Coal Emergency Officers, and their
criticism would be met by the above suggestions, by Mr. Amery&apos;s proposal for the permanent appointment of Civil Commissioners and their periodical conferences with the Chief Offi cers concerned, end by pre-strike co-operation between the General Inspectors of the Ministry of Health who act as Chiefs of Staff to the Civil Commissioners, and the Coal Emergency Officers.go od De p a rt men t.There was distinct over-lapping in the early part of the stoppage between the Coal Emergency Officers and the Emergency Staff of the Food Department, the latter in some cases devoting themselves largely to fuel questions.   This was remedied by the two Departments and the Pood Department Emergency Staff was reduced in view of the existence and duties of the Coal Emergency Officers.

The Committees ensured that a reserve of coal was retained at Collieries for the working of machinery for pumping etc, provided statistics  and endeavoured to arrange for the economic distribution of that coal which could be distributed inland to meet pressing needs-^Coal Emergency Officers.    A Coal Emergency Officer was appointed to each of the 93 areas Into which the country was divided for Road Transport purposes, by the Ministry of Transport.    These officers were responsible for ascertaining the essential needs for fuel in their districts, and advising the Central Emergency Committee In London,   and the District Coal &amp; Coke Supplies Committees, of the position.They also co-ordinated the work of Local Authorities and Trade Organisations,   and acted with the Food and Transport Officers appointed to the same areas in executing orders Issued by Headquarters Committees. Owing to the abolition of Government control and the disbanding of Mines Department Provincial Staff It was necessary to entrust this work (with the exception of 6 districts) to coal merchants nominated by the Coal Merchants5 Federation, which bore the expense and was responsible, through the Central Emergoncy Committee, for the work ef the Coal Emergency Officers.      ,  ,Coal Merchants Committees.    It was arranged with the Coal Merchants1 Federation to set up Committees In most Local Authorities Areas in the country consisting of responsible Coal Merchants and representatives of the Local Authority.    It was the duty of thotse Committees to distribute available coal stocks to the best advantage and, If necessary, to pool resources for economic working,    The Committees also  advised the Local Authority as regards the Issue of permits.Local Authorities were responsible for executing  and enforcing tKe Emergency Directions Issued by the Government,  and the issue of permits for supplies.Representatives of the Coal Merchants&apos; Federation and of the National Council of Coal Traders were also appointed te advise Civil Commissioners concerning the Coal Position in their Areas,   and on technical questions which might have arisen if a general strike had eventuated. &apos;-.With the exception of the Mines Department representatives at Ports,  and 6 Coal Emergency Offioers,
the Local Organisation was on a voluntary basis, and did not involve the Government in any expense.Special pov/ers given to Mr. I&apos;.

Organisation to deal with fuel shlpmen&quot;ts..whether permanently or temporarily - during tho Emergency.Organisation &amp; Duties.. 3.       On the foregoing &quot;basis as already stated the work to be performed during an Emergency falls under three heads(a) Conservation of fuel.(b) Distribution of fuel.(c) Importation of fuel if decided upon.4.       Conservation of. fuel may be divided into:-(1) The prevention of fuel leaving the country during an Emergency.(2) The restriction of its use in this country.5. To carry out 4 (1), the Coal Sub-Committeesets up   a Shipping Sub-Conamittee which sits at headquarters and which works through:-(a) Shipping Emergency Comraittees specially set up at the five principal loading p or ts, namely: -Cardiff - for South Wales Area, Newcastle - for Area Amble to Tees. Glasgow -   for Scotland.liveroool - for Area Mostyn to SolwayFirth-Hull - for Humber Area. These Committees consist of looal representatives of the Departments concerned, and prominent members of the trade. &apos; (b)Collectors of Customs at all other ports. Through this Organisation -the shipment of fuel abroad and coastwise, and for bunkers, for all purposes (including fishing) is regulated. 6.        To carry out 4 (2), namely, restrictions in the use of fuel in this country, Directions are organisation to deal with res trie tions &apos; of i&amp;ae, and supplies.SO.
made by the Secretary for Mines from time to time with the approval of the Coal Sub-Committee (ox-, other authority where necessary) limiting or restricting the supply of fuel to and the use of fuel by certainconsumers or prohibiting the use of fuel by certainconsumers as is deemed necessary in the national interests.    (See Para. 7, Sub-Para. B2 as toresponsibility for enforcing these Orders).Committees   7. The work of enforcing these restrictionsup and officlaTsand of distributing supplies, (3(b)), devolves mainly on tho local authorities and the coal trade, the organisation being as follows(a) A Central Coal Emergency Committee, set up at neadquarters, is made responsible for the whole of Great Britain, with the exception of the Metropolitan Area, (see 8 below). This body consisting of representatives of Colliery Owners, Coal Traders, Coal Merchants and the Mines Department also acts as an Advisory Committee to the Department and the Coal Sub-Committee during the Emergency.(b) This Committee co-ordinates the following organisations throughout the Country :-(1) Coal and Coke Supplies Committees,consisting of Colliery Owners and Coal Consumers, who are responsible for the disposal of coal.at coal mines in their areas under orders issued from Headquarters. (2) Local Authorities, e.g., officials of boroughs, town councils, rural district councils and urban district -31-
councils who are empowered to enforcewithin their areas, the EmergencyDirections referred to in paragraph 6.(3) Committees set up within thearea of each Local Authority andconsisting of members of the Local&apos;1Authority and Coal Merchants who areresponsible for- the detailed distributionof coal within their areas.Note.      The effect of (2) and (3) above is that the Local Authorities alone are responsible for enforcing Emergency Directions and prosecuting offenders and also for seeing that available supplies are distributed in the best way possible in the general interest, as prescribed in the Emergency Directions.    The Coal Merchants are responsible for advising the Authorities and for the actual executive work of distribution and for all financial arrangements as between themselves as sellers and the consumers as purchasers.(4) Coal Emergency Officers who are made responsible for large areas (at present the areas are the same as the Road Transport Areas), and co-ordinate the activities of the Committees referred to in Paragraph 7 by acting in liaison with the Coal and Coke Supply Committees (Para. 7.b.l.), with the local Committees (7.b. 3. ) and with the Central Coal Emergency Committee in London, 7 (a).(5) Local Associations of Coalowners and others interested, who are responsible - 32 -

Its functions are for that area similar to those of the Central Coal Emergency Committee,  (Para.  7 a) and in addition it does the more important work in regard to supervising supplies which in the provinces is carried out by the Local Authorities. 9. During the last Emergency it became necessary for the Government to import coal.      A Departmental Executive Committee, called the Coal Importation Committee was therefore set up and made responsiblo to the Secretary for ^ines.      Its functions were to purchase coal abroad, arrange f^r its shipment and its distribution in this country. It employed four well known coal purchasing and shipping firms to advise it and to carry out the executive parts of its functions. 10. The foregoing organisation was co-ordinatedwhere necessary with other Emergency organisations: -1,      By the Mines Department providing CivilCommissioners before they proceeded t* their districts with full particulars of the local organisations, addresses of Committees in thoir district etc. 2.     By the Mines Department appointing prominent members o&apos;f the Trade conversant with the Mines Department local organisation to advise tho Civil Commissioners in their districts and
to keep them in touch with the Committees referred to in paras, 7 (b) 1, 4 &amp; 5. 3.

Part III.Industries and Businesses.7. The consumption of coal in premises to which this Part of these Directions applies, that is to say, in any factory, work-shop, or other business premises, shall be restricted so that not more than 50 per cent, of the weekly average quantity of coal consumed in the four weeks last preceding the date of these Directions coming into force may be consumed in any week after such date, saving as may hereinafter in these Directions be provided :Provided always that where it is shown to the satisfaction of the local authority that the said weekly average does not afford.a fair criterion of the quantity normally consumed in any such premises, regard may be had to the quantity consumed in such premises for the week in the year 1920 most nearly corres-ponding in date to that in which the consumption is to be regulated hereunder and such quantity may be deemed to be the weekly average for the purposes of these Directions.8. Where it is deemed by a local authority expedient in the public interest to do so the percentage named in the preceding Article may be increased, and the local authority or its duly authorised officer shall, in such case, issue a permit in writing specifying the extent to which the percentage may be increased and stating the grounds upon which the issue of such permit is deemed to be in the public interest.9. Any permit given as in the preceding Article provided may, by notice in writing, be cancelled or varied by the local authority or its duly authorised officer, and the quantity thereby authorised may be increased or may be reduced to any figure not less than 50 per cent, of the said weekly average :Provided that the said quantity may only be increased where it is deemed to be in the public interest to do so and that the ground upon which such increase is deemed to be in the public interest shall be stated in the said notice.10.

After the conclusion of the said period of two weeks or after the consumption of 50 per cent, of the said stocks, whicb-
ever may first occur, no coal may be consumed in any premises where the last preceding Article has operated, unless and until a permit in writing shall have been granted by the local authority stating the quantity of coal that may be consumed in such premises, and such quantity shall not exceed that prescribed in Article 7 unless in the opinion of the local authority or its duly authorised officer there is reason for acting under the provisions of Article 8.12. The person responsible for the management of an industry or business on any premises to which this Part of these Directions applies, whether as owner, occupier, or manager of the premises or in any other capacity, shall furnish to the. local authority, it&apos; and when required to do so, a true and complete return in writing showing what stocks of coal are in his possession or available for consumption on the premises, and what quantities of coal were consumed on the premises during the four weeks last pre-ceding the date upon which these Directions come into force.13. (a) No coal shall be supplied or acquired for consumption or otherwise upon any such premises as aforesaid unless a permit in writing shall first have been granted by the local authority in respect.of such premises, stating the quantity of coal that may be supplied and acquired for consumption thereon.(o) Before any such permit may be granted a return must have been furnished as provided in Article 12 hereof.14. For the purposes of this Part of these Directions the term coal &quot; shall include coke, briquettes, and any other solid fuel of which coal or coke is a constituent.15.

In these Directions the expression &quot; business premises &quot; includes any shop and any premises or any part of any premises exclusively used for the purposes of any profession, trade, employment, or vocation.Pakt IV. Coal Stocks.17. Subject to the Directions of the Secretary for Mines the -District Coal and Coke Supplies Committees shall regulate, in. the areas for which they have been respectively appointed, the supply and distribution of coal from any stocks which may be or become available in their respective areas for the purposes named. Available stocks for the purposes of this Article shall, subject as aforesaid, consist of any coal at a coal mine within the area of a District Coal and Coke Supplies Committee and any coal coming into the said area in train.
18. The District Coal and Coke Supplies Committees shall have power to take possession of any such available stocks of coal, and to direct the supply of such coal or any part thereof, to any named consignee or destination, and, where coal is allo-cated from a coal mine, to direct its delivery in the wagons of the coal mine.19. Any person having in his possession coal which is avail-able for the purposes of this Part of these Directions shall, upon receipt of a demand in writing from the District Coal and Coke Supplies Committee or a person duly authorised by them in that behalf, give possession of the said coal or such part thereof as may be so demanded to any person specified in the said demand.Part V. Shipment.20. No coal shall be shipped either as cargo or bunkers, whether coastwise or foreign, in any vessel at any port in Great Britain unless permission in writing for such shipment shall first have been given by the Secretary for Mines or a person duly authorised by him in that behalf.21. The Collector of Customs or other the proper officer of Customs at any port in Great Britain, where it is desired to make any such shipment, may give permission as aforesaid on behalf of the Secretary for Mines.Part VI.Gas Manufacture.22. All persons who supply gas, whether under statutory authority or otherwise, shall use the coal required for the produc-tion of gas in such a manner as to effect the greatest possible saving in the consumption of coal.23. With the object of maintaining a supply of gas at adequate pressure during such periods of the day or night when the effective use of it by consumers is most needed, persons who supply gas, whether under statutory authority or otherwise, shall supply the same at other periods of the day or night at pressures so much lower than those prescribed under* any special Act or Order applying to their undertaking as may be best calculated to secure a supply of gas at adequate pressure during such first-mentioned periods.24. All persons supplying gas shall notify the local authority of the district by notice in writing, and shall notify their con-consumers, by newspaper advertisements and placards, of such periods of the day and night during which the pressure of gas will be insufficient to permit of its effective use in consumers&apos; fittings and apparatus.

The local outhority or its duly authorised officer may direct that any supply of gas or electricity, whether for light, heat, power, or any other purpose, in any premises, whether industrial business, domestic, or of any other description, be diminished or cut off where there is reason to believe that the supply is being abused or used in excess so as to prejudice the interests of the public. Any such direction shall be in writing, and a copy shall be served upon the owner or occupier of the premises to which the direction relates.Part VIII. general.33.
