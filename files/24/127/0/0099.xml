orppi ccui&quot;uv, JLkkejibm jpa660has been pointed out more than once that theJReport Mo.  the   UNEMPLOYEDInternational Socialist Club is the organisation behind the demonstrations of the unemployed.   This Club lately received  1,000 from the funds of the Communist Party which, in turn, received its funds from Russia.The names of the Communist agitators in London recur in reports from the provinces showing that they are moving rapidly from place to place.The organisation of the unemployed is proceeding feverishly, the outstanding feature being the demands made on the Guardians in practically every English county. TheLabour Party appears likely to be hoist with its own petard, for tho demand for full maintenance has beenadopted by the extremists to an extent which has alarmed even the Woolwich Labour Councillors.    It is satisfactory to note that there has been comparatively little disorder, although the tendency to demonstrate is spreading with lightning rapidity as may be judged from the reports given below.The feeling of responsible Labour, leaders is that Parliament should.be summoned in October to reconsider unemployment and a national campaign organised to whip public opinion into a &quot;turmoil,&quot; Many of the Boards of Guardians are of opinion that the problem should be tackled nationally.The great mass of genuine unemployed is still quiescent, but this state will scarcely stand the strain of increased distress and cold weather.    It is understood that the Ministry of Healthjis advising the Guardians to give relief in kind rather than in money.    In regard to rent, it saould oa possible to issue vouchers, whichthe/
the lpndlords could cash at the Councils. The varying demaif put forward this week are shown in tabular form below.This week the ntimber of processions and meetings shows -en in crease - on last.week and the Communist organisation of t unemployed is proceeding apace.    The London officials, who frequent the International Socialist Club, are reported tobs making a good living out of the unemployed agitation. The attitude of the genuine unemployed, however, remains reasonable.The Executive Committee of the London Labour Party has addressed to the Prime Minister a letter on the unemployment question, in whioh it is stated that the Govern man t &quot;has not faced the fundamentals of the problem&apos;&quot; and &quot;is guilty of grave neglect of its duties towards large masses of the population.&quot;     The Executive urges that a special session of Parliament should be called&apos;immediately, in order that legislation may be passed and administrative action taken on.the lines suggested in the report of the Trade Union Congress and Labour Party on Unemployment, published in January&apos;last ,     (summarised in my report-IIo. 90 of 27.1.21) Alternatively tho Executive suggests that if the Government prefers the matter to be dealt with by the&quot;Poor&apos;Law authorities, it should provide the money.Tho question of out-door relief has aroused considerabl anxiety in middle .class, end even in trade union&apos; circles in London;    it is urged that relief should be given in kindonly and that, wherever possible, work of seme description should be provided, if for-no other reason than that the&quot;work-shy&quot; could ,be distinguished from the genuine unemploy^&apos; &apos; - &apos; &apos;-&apos;-- -.....-   &apos;     &apos;-&apos;---&quot;      -&apos;.- .BermohdseyOr- September 6th the unemployed crowded Bermonds&amp;y Tewal Hall and passed a resolution demanding immediate solution of[the/
the unemployment problem by the Government.   The Mayor presided and was told by the men &quot;Ifs grub, not resolutions we want.&quot;BrentfordOn September 5th about 1,200 unemployed, mostly men in the engineering and building trades, with their wives and children, marched from Icton, Hahwell and Chiswick to the Brentford Guardians&apos; Offioes, and were informed that the Board would maet on September 13th to dfaw up a scale of relief.CamberwellOn September 3rd, about 500 people attended an unemployed meeting at Brunswick Square, Camberwell. Burnett stated that there were 16,000 unemployed in the Borough and that on the previous day-he had applied to the Gtiardians for relief..    If the Guardians refused to grant their terms he proposed that the Camberwell unemployedshould march en masse to the Gordon Road Workhouse and demand admission. The audience unanimously agreed to this proposal. The chief agitators in this district are Burnett, Fannin, Ray, Vincent and Bowden. On September 6th the Guardians informed a deputation that they would consider the demands and give a decision not later than September 12th.ClerkenwellMeetings have been held and a committee is being organised to demand relief on the Islington scale.Pe-ptfordDeptford unemployed have been organised chiefly by a Communist named Earmsworth:   he stated at a recent meeting that if the demands of the unemployed did not receive proper attention, direot aotibn would be adopted.   This man is a member of the International Socialist Club and other members of the Committee aroSivyer, Flowers, and Kilock, the secretary.     Meetings were held on August 3ist, September 2nd, September 3rd and September 4th:   Harmsworth spoke at each meeting and at the last all the speakers were Communists.FinsburyMeetings have been held and a committee is being organised to demand relief on the Islington scale.Fulham &apos;On August 31st, Hanson, who has helped to organise Fulham unemployed, stated that the local committee proposed to organise a deputation to the Guardians.   He advised them in the eveht of the Guardians refusing to see them, to see the Relieving Ofiicer in twos and threes, refuse the relief offered as inadequate and ask for an order for admission      the Workhouse.   When 300 to 400 had obtained these orders they should go together one night and demand admission.   He knew they would all be refusedbecause/
because the Workhouse was full now, but this course of action whioh had been successful in Battersea and other Boroughs, would compel the Guardians to grant them out-door relief.The organised unemployed have several timeB approached the Clerk of the Guardians with the request that a meeting be oalled to discuss relief and Hanson addresses meetings daily:   the Board meets to-day and it is possible that a deputation from the unemployed will seek admission.GreenwichOn September 6th a deputation asked the Guardians for work or maintenance on a high scale, but preferred work; the Board decided to make a temporary order, after allowing for income, to respectable working class families up to 10/- for a husband, 10,/- for a wife, 5/- for each child and &quot;an allowance in approved cases to keep the home together.&quot;   The offer was accepted under pro/best.HackneyOn August 31st a procession of the Hackney unemployed, which increased from 300 to 3,000, marched to the offices of the Board of Guardians.   Their secretary, W. Bullen, and Kelvit, of the   London Trades and Labour Council, headed a deputation which was informed that every case would be dealt with on its merits and that no general system of relief would be allowed.    Bullen and Kelvit then Invited the unemployed to demand immediate admission to the Hackoey Infirmary, where the Gtt&amp;rdians were sitting:   99 men and 6. women responded and were admitted. Of these 26 remained in the institution and the others, when they were informed that their oases would be the subj eot of enquiry, left the building. ^Prior to the procession, speeches were made by Bullen and McPherson:   the latter said:&quot;To-day, in the Borough, there are ten thousand men out of worfc, and what do I find.   You are still content to walk the streets and look for that whioh you know you cannot find.   You are still content to allow the blood sucking pestilent class to live on your backs...You have got to remember this, to Hell with all. this Government that if bringing us into the degradation that we are in tc-day.     To Hell with the Board of Guardians. To Hell with those who say, neither shall wehave work nor maintenance.    I know the difficulties you, who are unemployed, have got.    I know that you, a good many of you, are afraid to go out for something that is going to benefit you...When you took up that responsible position th8t you would look after that woman right through the piece, yet you men to-day are not even, looking after those who you fought for. Therefore we find that they have not boots, not even sufficient in their stomachs.   You would rather allow the boards to deal out doles.&quot;The temper cf the crowd web very ugly and on. their arrival at the Infirmary, extra police aid was summoned to keep the situation in hand.The Master of tho Workhouse reports that onSeptember/

On September 6th the Woolwich Labour party iseued a manifesto, upholding the right of the unemployed to maintenance but pointing out that the scale demanded would amount to a charge on the looal rates of at least  25,000 per week, a &quot;sum equivalent to more than ,a ,6d. rate per week and involving an increase on rent of&apos;6/- a week.

of their possessions in order to get food.
