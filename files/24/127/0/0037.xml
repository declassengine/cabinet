This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. \ g 3 SECRET. 1(5CP. 3236.THE CABINET.IRELAND.MEMOEANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate the following Note by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff for     79 consideration by the Cabinet. Irish760&quot;L. W.-E.The War Office, .   17th August, 1921.Secretary of State, - ,On 24th May I wrote a short memorandum to you covering two Notes by General Macready.   This afterwards became Cabinet Paper CP. 2965.The situation then envisaged by both General Macready and myself was an intensive campaign against the rebels, based on the supposition that we still had some 3 months of fine weather and that the drafts from the battalions serving in Ireland due to be sent to the East would not be withdrawn. The position to-day is very different. The Adjutant-General has already begun to withdraw men for the drafts, and before the year is out some 13,500 men will have been withdrawn from Ireland. They will be replaced by all those men now at the dep6ts who are fit to take their places in the ranks, but the net result of this withdrawal of men for drafts will be that on 1st December of this year the infantry battalions will average only 495 ration strength. In addition, we are now drawing near the time when the weather breaks in Ireland, and the result of these two things is that, in my judgment, it will be impossible to engage in a really strenuous winter campaign at the strength at which we shall find ourselves and in the weather which will prevail. That being so, I wish to bring to your notice the fact that, in my judgment, we shall have to recruit specially in order to bring the battalions up to at least 800, and preferably 1,000, men per battalion. This will necessitate a recruitment of about 40,000 men. These men must obviously be men who have been trained to arms and who can take their place at once in the ranks in active hostilities. It is only by this means that we can hope to carry on a successful campaign through the coming winter months. I would add this, that if the Government decide to engage in these further hostilities, our best chance of a success is to carry them out with the maximum strength which we can possibly attain ; this will be cheaper in lives, both for ourselves and for the rebels, and infinitely more certain of successful issue, and in much shorter time than if we attempt such an operation with weak units and bad weather.The Adjutant-General is putting up to you a short Note on the strength of the battalions at different dates during the coming autumn and winter.Henry Wilson, Field-Marshal,Chief of the Imperial General Staff.16th August, 1921.(B21/291)   100  6/21   H&amp;S, Ltd.   9418wo
