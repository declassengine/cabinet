FILIAL REPORT 01 disability pensions COMMITTEE.(Moiap randy;-byi the Homo Secretary and, the Mini starof Health).   &apos;On June 3rd. 1921, tho Cabin at had before thorn a Note by Mr. Stanley Baldwin, covering the Final Report of the Disability Pensions Committee (C.P.268l) and a memor-andum by the Secretary of State for Air (CP. -2894).    The Cabinet agreed (Cabinet 48 (21) Conclusion 3):-.&quot;That the question should be referred for decision to the following Cabinet -Committee The Home Secretary (in - the Chair). The Minister of Health. Dr. Add.ifc.onwho should, hear the views of the officers of tho Depart-merits concerned.&apos;1.The above Committee (of which Dr.&apos; Addison ceased to be a member on his resignationffcom the Government) has. had. before it, in addition to the Cabinet papers referred to above, memoranda by the Service Departments and by the Treasury,    The Coranitt.ee has also heard &quot;the view cf repre-s ent at i ve s of tho s e Lop art merit 3 .&apos;The question at issue in the final Report of the Disability Pensions Committee (C.P.2o3l) is of wound pensions and gratuities.   The majority of the Committee recommended that tho system of wound, pensions arid gratuitous-ties should, be abolished on the ground that it is anomalous in three respects:-wound(l) only officers receive/pensions and gratuities, anci among officers the pension   varies not only with the degree of disability but even to a greater extent in accordance with rank.
(2)   if the - wound, does-not&quot; cause- t he-officer&apos;^ &quot;&quot;xe tixe-merit, he draws his wound pension In addition t*the full service pay:   and(3)   the pension and gratuity for the wound affordsa higher rate of compensation than the pension for diseases assessed by modern medical opinon as causing the same degroe of disability.They also recommended that disabilities caused bywounds should in future be compensated at the same arateeand on the same conditions as the equivalent disabilitiescaused by attributable disease.     such compensation wouldbe based on a schedule of specific Injuries (applicableto men and officers alike) similar to that appended tothe War Warrant for men, dated the 6th December, 1919...Th9 Admiralty and War Office members dissentedfrom these recommendations and put forward alternativeand differing proposals which are to be found in the appendices to CP, 2681.It was thought convenient that the Service Depart-raenls should co-ordinate proposals and as a result ofan inter-departmental meeting the following joint   &apos;proposals by the Service Departments were put forward for consideration by us i-pension to be granted according to the degree of disablement caused by the wound or wounds:-Army ranks and corresponding Maximum for Minimum 20$ ranks in Navy and Air Force   total dis-     disablement.ablement.   Captain or Subaltern 200 40Lieutenant-Colonel or Major     250 50Colonel or Colonel Commandant 300 60Major-General &amp; higher ranks. 400 80Pension to be payable from the date of the wound but only at half rate while the officer is serving. No addition to pension in the form of gratuity.
Injuries on duty suocfc classified as &quot;in action&quot; should be provided for on similar lines, but with ade.duot.ion of 25$.She wound pension would generally take the place of the disability addition to retired pay.    If there- is a medical disability distinct from the disability caused by woundara. It should be pensioned separately;   but no degree of medical disability should be taken into acesfi^t which with the disability arising from the wound or wounds would sraount to more than total disablement. The Committee were a$so informed that the Admiraltystill desired,to press for the extension of wound pensions to men.The Committee have carefully considered the pro-posais of -fih  Service Departments and tho arguments in favour of them, the most important of which aro as follows:-(1)    That tha tradition in favour of the present system is so strong that the system cannot be abolished, and that the Cutting down of wounds pensions to the medical disability level Would amount to an appreciable reduction in the emoluments Of wounded officers.(2)    The &quot;sentimental&quot; reasons in favour of thesystem. e.g. that an officer in risking his life should feel assured of generous treatment, and that there .1s a certain glamour attached to a wound in action.(3)    That wound pensions and gratuities are a solatium for suffering and disfigurement.NOTE:     The rate already agreed for disability due toto condition^of service are, in the case of regular officers  100 per anaum for 1QC$ disability in addition to service pension.
(4) That medical disabilities are of very varying degrees of real attributability wbbrcas there is no doubt ae to the attilbutability of disability arising from wounds. The above arguments are advanced to support the contention that wounds pensions should be on a higher scale than pensions given for medical disability.(5) In favour of graduation for rank it is urged that higher pension should be given for higher rank because the annual value of the lost prospects is greater and this is not adequately met, it is said, by the earned increase on retired pay.     Further, as an Officer grows older the wearing out of his body makes the percentage of his attributability less and less tft medical disability.   An increase for rank in wound pensions reflects this relatively decreasing attributability in medical oases, (6) In favour of payment of wound pensions during service it le urged that the serving officer has more expenses In consequence of his wounds. e.g., in travelling expenses, attendance and insurance. (7) That as regards the extension of the system to men the Jerram Committee recommended such extension and, In any case, the extension cannot be of great consequence as serious injury would lead to invaliding in the case of manual labourers, and the extra expense would be limited to the period between the occurrence of the injury and the date of invaliding, /While appreciating the force of the above arguments we do not oonsider that they should prevail in perpetuating a system which was the subject of adverse comment by the Public Accounts
i677^Committee in 1906, was re^jeniayH^denina^ SelectCommittee on Pensions.,- and la opposed by the Disability Penslona-OoTrtrnlttee.     The tradition in favour of the present system is, no doubt, a strong one but we think that tho Government may Justly claim that the present revision of the pensions system affords a suitable opportunity for a breach with tradition if the system supported by tradition cannot be shewn to be.inherently reasonable.     We are not satisfied that the &quot;sentimental&quot; reasons advanoed are sound, since It may equally well be argued that an offloer injured otherwise than in action or rendered unfit by disease should be pensioned at a higher rate to compensate for lose of &quot;glamour&quot;, nor do we think that differences in suffering or dis-figurement (if any) can be calculated in cash terms. The argument (No. (4) above) that medical disability Is of very varying degrees of real attributabllity, whereas there is no doubt as to the attributability of disability arising from  wounds, really amounts to a rejection by the fighting services of the opinion of their medical advisers.     Both disability from woundaand medical dls-ability are calculated on exactly the same scale by medical boards, who, for example, will aimply report one officer as   50$ disabled from wounds and another as 50$ disabled from disease through service.     The disability from service Is the same and there Is no logical reason why the pension should not be the same,
i678As regards argument Ko.(5) above to think it open to question whether&apos; an elderly officer really deserves a higher- rate of pension than an officer who is disabled while still a young man,, vdth his career before him whilst tho second argument that age makes the percentage! of true attributability Iqsh is merely another refusal of the Services to take seriously the opinions of their medical advisors jAs. regards tho extra oxpoiiso incurred by wounded officers, we wish to point out that officers who have suffered from disease and are still employed by the services may very well; be -put to extra expanse by reason of incapacity arising from the disease, and it cannot bo maintained that wounded officers are always worse &quot;lives&quot; for insurance purposes than officers who have suffered from disease. Moreover these oases should, in our opinion, bo met by special grants and not by increases in pensions , and we understand that the Treasury are prepared to consider this proposal favourably.The remaining point is the desire of the Admiralty not only to continue the present system of wound pensions but to extend it tc men, on account of the Government * s acceptance of the Jerram Corn-mi ttoo&apos;a Report.     On this point wo endorse-the opinion of tha Disability Pensions Committee, which is as follows:-   &quot;The extension of the systom of wound pensions to men is an entirely new development, it is contrary to tho views of tho &quot;7ar Office-, and it is felt, that tho Government would justly bo open to severe criticism if it now actually extended the scope of a system which had been so strongly condemned by Parliamentary Committee.    At the same time the retention of the system, however modified in detail, for officers will place -the Admiralty in a position of some difficu ty if it is not extended to men.      This consideration confirms the majority of the Committee in their view that the proper course i3 to withdraw wound pensions and gratuities from officers.&quot;
With regard to the concluding paragraph of the memorandum by the Secretary of State fpr Air dated 2?th April 1921 (cp.2894) the Committee are informed that the followihg steps will be taken to revise pensions rates in accordance with material changes in the general cost of living:-(i) the service element in the officers disability retired pay will be readjusted under the arrangements already made for the readjustment of officers retired pay in 1924,&apos;and thereafter annually;(ii) as regards the disability elements of the pensions of officers and men, the Great War Warrants provide a sliding scale with a guaranteed minimum; the Post War scales have been fixed below this minimum, and the question of reducing them cannot arise in the immediate future;(iii) as however a prolonged fall in the cost of living over a period of years might justify some reduction in post war pensions,- notwithstanding that Great War pensions could not be touched, power will be    re-served, in the necessary Warrants, Orders in Council etc, to enable a revision to be effected.    It is also possible that, such a power mu?.y be needed to remove anomalies between the Great War and. Post War : cales,arising from the different methods adopted of combining service and. disability elements,
i3f OFFICERS, We observe that on page 3 of tho Roport ofT HALF-PA?iST. the-^Di^a^UJ-ty---sP^xa^nis---CouJaiitt e e (C.P.2681)there is a difference of opinion, between the majority of the Committee and the War Office representa-tive as to whether Army Officers pronounced permanently unfit (due to service) should remain for five years on the half-pay list, as they do under existing regulations.   We do not* however, gather that the Disability Pensions Committee make a reoommendation and this passage of. their report seems to be designed to call attention to-a practice v*hich is prima facie   an anomaly.   We do not, therefore, consider that this point is onewhich calls for a ruling from us, especially as-it appears to be rather a domestic matter between the Treasury and the War Office.EE COMMBHDATIOH. We accordingly recommend to the Cabinet as follows:-That the final report of the Disability-Pensions Committee (c.P.268l) should be approved by the Cabinet; such approval to involve the abolition of the present system of wound pensions and the future compensation-a-tion of disabilities caused by wounds ^t the sauie rates and on the same conditions as an equivalent disability caused by attributable disease.(Sgd.)
