phis doowmm is the property op his britaknio majesties government,G. A BINE T.International Labour Conference at Geneva in OctoberQuestion of Chairmanship.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OP LABOUR.lEORET.!.p. 1220.I circulate to the Cabinet a memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour regarding the question of the Chairmanship of the forthcoming International Labour Conference at Geneva in October next.If the Cabinet decide that we aro to press for the nomination of an English Chairman, I suggest that Mr. Barnee has outstanding claims for consideration and that the Cabinet should adhere to tho informal view expressed Tiy them in December, 1920.If on the other hand, tho Cabinet decide that we accept tho nomination of m. Ador, I agree that it should if possible, be on tho understanding suggested by Sir Montague Barlow.    Such a nomination should not create a precedent for future Conferences, but should be treated simply aB a compliment to Switzerland to mark tho fact that the forthcoming Conference is the first Conference of the international Labour Organisation helc\ on Swiss soil.(Sgd.) T.J. MACNAMARA.Ministry of Labour. 12.8.21.
[HE MINISTER.International Labour Conference at Geneva In October,The question of Chairmanship,The Third International Labour Oonferonoe will bo held at Geneva in October, and the question of chairmanship is Important. At the previous Conferences at -Washington 1919,Genoa 1920,the Chairman was nominated by the country where the Conference was held.    In future those Conferences will be permanently at Goneva and it is not desirablo that a Swiss should always take the Chair,I disoussod tho matter with M. Thomas informally at Geneva recently.    At first he suggested m. Pontaino, the Chairman of the Governing Body, as Chairman, but I said I did not think this would be well received in other countries, aa it would mean that France held practioally all the offioos -The Chairman of the Conference, The Chairman of the Governing Body, and The Director of the Bureau. M. Thomas then suggested that if an English statesman of the position of Viscount Ullewater (who has recently been doing excellont work at Gonova as Chairman of the Emigration Commission), or Viscount Cave, were nominated by the British Government,, he thought the French Would raise no objection, and he personally would welcome either of these distinguished Englishmen as Chairman.On the 23rd December, 1920, when the International Labour Office work was definitely placed by the Cabinet under the control of the Ministry of Labour, I understand an informal view was ex-pressed in Cabinet that the Right Hon. George Barnes might be asked to be Chairman of the next Conference,    Mr&quot;. Barnes has undoubtedly great claims for consideration but I am informed that he does not know French and also that when he was in the Chair at Washington on occasions, he was not altogether successful as a Chairman.I have heard rocontly from H, Thomas that the Swiss are likely to press for the right to nominate on this occasion, at any rate, a Swiss as Chairman in the person of M. Ador.     To this nomination on general grounds there could bo no exception taken.    He is well known as a statesman of distinction and has been President of the Swiss Confederation and, I understand, is a good Chairman and man of business.I aBk the Cabinet decision -(i) whether we are tc accept the proposal that m. Ador should be the Chairman, at any rate for the ensuing Conference. I suggest that if his nomination is accepted, I should endeavour to secure a general understanding that the claims of Great Britain to nominate the Chairman for the 1922 Conference should be recognised.     On that basis the question of the personnel of an English Chairman could stand over till next year.(ii) If, on the other hand, we aro to press for the nomination of an Englishman for the ensuing Conference In October next, I ask the decision of the Cabinet as to who should be put forward for the position.12. 8. 21.(Intld.)
