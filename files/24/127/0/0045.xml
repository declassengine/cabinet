S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)jFIDSNTIAL. i. 5244.I . CABINET.3CHARGE FOR DOMINION OFFICERS ATTENDING THE STAFF COLLEGE AT CAM3ERLEY.Memorandum by tho Secretary of State for the Colonies. -A question has arisen concerning the charges for Dominion officers attending the Staff College at Camberley which I wish to submit for my colleagues consideration.A recommendation was made by the Committee of the Imperial Conference of 1911, convened to discuss military defence, that &quot;the accommodation and Staff at Camberley should be increased sufficiently to enable not less than 12 or 13 officers of the Forces of the Dominions to be admitted annually, and that the Dominions should contribute towards the cost of this increased accommodation and any necessary in-crease in Instructional and Military Staff, such contribution to take the form of an annual payment per capita for each officer at a rate to be agreed on, which it is understood would be, approximately  200.&quot;This recommendation was subsequently approved by the Imperial Conference of 1911, and In 1913 a contribution of  200 a year for each officer was sanctioned by the Treasury During the war no course was attended by Dominion officers, but the 1919 course roes attended by officers from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.     This course was charged for at the rate fixed before the war, but, in view of the altered conditions, the Army Council asked that the Dominion Governments should be informed that the rate of  200 per annum was liable to revision and that a revised
&quot;TOite *woulx3 apply &quot;to offlcero^attendJ^ng the 1920 course.An intimation was sent accordingly.The Army Council on the 9th of July, 1921,suggested an increase of the rate i-c-  700 per annum for each dominion officer with effect from January, 1920.     The    ;-reasons for the suggested increase were set out In a mem-memorandum which has been communicated to the Dominion Govern-ments for their consideration and is appended...     Of these reasons tho chief are -(1) Increase in prices and of rates of pay;(2) A more definite Idea of the true cost of the Staff College and other Army establishments has now been obtained;(3) The  200 charged in 1919 was belowthe cost involved,.but was accepted in view of the fact that the figure had already been mentioned at the Imperial Conference of 1911.I fear that this large increase in the charge per officer.may have the effect of preventing the Dominions from filling in the future the vacancies allotted to them. So far as the Union of South Africa is concerned, the view has already been expressed semi-officially that the pro-posed Increase would result in the Union Government sending no more officers to attend the Staff College, and that the political effects might be unfortunate..     Objection has also been taken to the new rate being effective for. the 1920 and 1921 courses to which officers have already been sent from South Africa..     The Ministers from the other Dominions now in London have. not yet taken similar objection, but. I anticipate that one or more of the Dominion Govern-ments.will almost certainly do so later on.In my opinion it would be most unfortunate if, in consequence of the increased cost, the Dominions ceased to send officers to the Staff College or even appreciably
reduced the existing numbers, and I would strongly urge that the proposed charge of  700 should be diminished.I have asked the Army Council to take no further action until the matter has been brought before the Cabinet and their decision in the matter obtained.(Intd)   W.S.CColonial Office. August 18th, 1921.
j^ORATOM..BX THS ARMY, OOTJNOIfr.At the Imperial Conference of 1911 it was agreed that room should be found at the Staff College for the attendance of a quota of Dominion officers each year, the necessary additions being made forthwith to the College buildings, and that the Dominion Governments should contri-bute to the cost of the institution (staff, accommodation and general running expenses) in the form of an annual payment per student at a rate to be agreed upon.     The rate fixed was  200.     The real estimate  at the time, that is to say, the figure obtained by dividing the total annual cost of the College (after deducting certain personal expenses borne by the Dominions direct) by the full number of students contemplated (120), was about  240, but a round  200 was accepto by the Imperial Government in consideration of the fact that this figure had already been mentioned to the Imperial Con-ference before the cost had been estimated, in detail,    (The average total number of students up to the outbreak of the war in fact only 102;    this number would have given a cost per head of about  280).The cost of the Staff College is very much larger now than it was in 1911.     This is partly due to the recent increase in rates of pay and in prices, partly to changes introduced before the war, such as the provision of a servant for each student at a considerably higher cost than the servant allowance previously given.Moreover we now possess proper accounts shewing the true cost of this and other Army establishments.
The accounts of the College for the financial year ended 51st March 1921, which are now practically oomplete, shewa cost ofbeing  862 per student per annum for 106 students.     To this we must add:- 91,406For non-effective charges of Staff 2,510xFor iedging, fuel and light allowances issued to students living out of College (added in order that the whole charge for accommodation may be in-cluded.     Apart from this item the figures do not Include the pay orallowances of students) 7,756Total  101,472.being  957 per student per annum.From this must be deducted any charges included above which are met out of allowances granted to the students by their own Govern-ments.     In 1911 the deductions to be made on. this account were considerable;   but, owing to varixjue changes, the only deduc-tion now to be made is In respectof forage. 6,713Total  94,719,being  894 per student per annum.The War Office propose the following further deductions:-(i)   The figure Included in the accounts for 1920/21 for rental value of the buildings is higher by  8,850 than in 1911.     It is proposed to make an Increase of only  1500 on this account (for increased cost of main-ten ance and repair) in the charge   7,550 against&apos; the Dominions.(II) Certain reductions in the gradings of the staff are in contemplation which are estimated to lead to a saving per annum of about 6,70014.050  80,669being  761 per student per annum.note. In any case where these allowances are issued to a studentby a Dominion Government instead of the War Office, an adjust-ment will be hecessary.
Further, In view of the fact that the number of students In future is expected to be between 110 and 115 as against 106 in 1920/21j it is suggested that the charge against the Dominion Governments shall be put at a round figure of  700 per student per annum.In comparing this figure, of  700 with the  280 quoted at the end of the first paragraph of this memorandum, it should be borne in mind that in 1911 the Dominion Governments bore direct, in the shape of allowances to their students, certain charges (e.g. for servants, bicycles, etc.) which are now provided by the War Office in kind and covered by the  700.The Dominions were notified about a year ago that a revised charge was under consideration for 1920 and subsequent courses, and it is suggested that the new rate should take effect from January, 1920, and should remain in force as long as the accounts shew no substantial change in the cost of the College per student.The War Office. 9th July, 1921.
