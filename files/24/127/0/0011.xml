(&apos;i&apos;his document is the property of His Britannic Ma josty&apos;s Government)CABINET.Housing of the Imperial War Museum..memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works,The Imperial War nusoum is now housed atthe Crystal Palaoe at an annual rent of  25;000, expiring at 1st April If84, by when the premises must be vacant. As the removal will probably take six months to effect, about 2 years hen&amp;e an alternative building must be ready or else the Palaoe authorities will be able to charge us practically what they please.    Steps must be taken immediatlly to provide for the future.War Liuseum that the Cabinet will refuse to sanction a now building to correspond with the space now occupied at the Crystal Palace, and they have accordingly agreed to make very large reductions in their schemee.   To-day they occupy 2o7,000 sq* ft, as against their original Idea of approximately 300,,000 sq0 ft.    The cost of erecting a builiing containing this space on the South side of the Thames was estimated at about  1,164,000r    The Standing Committee of the Museum are now prepared to curtail their exhibition space to about 05,000 ft,, and their Office &apos; reference and storage accommodation to 14,000 sq. ft,, Even so, I cannot press the Treasury to approve the expenditure necessary to erect a building of those-dimensions.   The only existing building in any way possible is the Imperial Institute which might be adapted for the War Museum at a comparatively small cost.1 have Informed the Standing Committee of theThe
The Institute Buildings consist of 171,505 ft, distributed as followsi-Imperial Institute 85)007London University. 49,605Victoria &amp; Albert Museum 27,165Science museum 9,728171,505I havo made informal enquiries on the subject and the Committee of the Institute oppose the scheme, Unfortunately, I was unable to get the matter discussed by the Dominion Ministers, v/ho might have been far from unsympathetic.   The Dominion produce exhibited at South Kensington creates so little interest that Overseas Governments have established their own centres for exhibition and and propaganda in the business quarters of London.   The attendance at the Imperial Institute is quite insignificant,    The average number of visitors on 8 occasions within the.last few days was only 7 adults and 15 juveniles,   The really living rork of the Institute is the Laboratory, whioh would not be displaced, nor would it be necessary to dislodge the London University from the buildingiI invite the Cabinet to approve my scheme in principle, and to authorise me to open negotiations with the Colonial Office, the India Offioe and the Agents for the Dominions and crown Colonies concerned.0. &amp; jb./( August, 1p21.
