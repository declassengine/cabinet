f THI3 POCftMBNT IS IffiB PRQPBRIFY 01? HI3 BRITAMIQ UAJ3STY!3 S0VEIR1MBBT.OABIIUI,Ul^mrJ)IOHAL UBOHIi ORGANISATION.Instructions to the Government&apos; delegates for the coning Conference at Genera in Ootober nextt 1921.M^OHANPIia BY gHB MIHIS&apos;J!E.R* OS? LABOUR,M,      It    She next Conference of tha International Labour organisationj.        will take place at Geneva beginning on October 25th next.2.    The sublets to be discussed at the Conference are six in number and are as follows;-(1) Constitution of the Governing Body.(2) Agricultural Questions.   These are of a widecharacter, and a questionnaire of 03 pages has been issued by the International Labour Office, but the principal point at issue is the application or otherwise of the Washington Convention cf 48 hours to agriculture.   Thebo agricultural questions are considered so important that they are treated as containing three separate items.(3) Disinfection of Wool infeoted with anthrax.(4) Prohibition of the use of White Lead in painting.(5) Weekly Rest Day in industrial and commercial establishments.(6) Age of employment as trimmers and stokers and compulsory medioal examination of all children on board ship.3.    The International Labour Office have issued Questionnaires or documents with regard to each of these subjects and careful replies on behalf of the Government have been drafted and seat to Geneva.   These replies were fully oonsidercd by theIv&apos; International Labour Committee under the Chairmanship of theParliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour, and on which all the Departments concerned are represented; and after consideration I forwarded these replies to Geneva in due course.
4.    Tho International labour Committee have held a further meeting and considered the question of precise instructions to tho Government delegates following tho general lines of the Governments answers already despatched and have drafted the instructions (oopy of v/hioh is attaohed).   Unless any of my colleagues dosire to make any oomnont, I shall assume that these Draft instructions have the approval of the Cabinet. 5.    The Draft instructions oovor all the itoDS on the Agenda except Ho, 1. Moform of the Constitution of the Governing Body&quot;, and No. 7. &quot;The Weekly Rest Bay in Industrial and Commercial astablishmants&quot;.   With regard to the first point, it has not been possible to draft instructions as no Questionnaire was received in time, but in view of the decisions of the Governing Body on the same point, no matter of serious importanoe seems likely to arise.   With regard to the Weekly East Day item, this is being considered by the Home Affairs Committee and the instructions to the delegates will embody their decision.6.    A series of Draft Conventions and Eecommendations which are to be submitted for consideration by the ootober Conference on the points outlined on the Agenda are at present in course of preparation by the International Labour Office at Geneva. The Draft instructions annexed hereto have been so framed as to cover all the chief points likely to be raised in these draft Conventions and Recommendations.7. With regard to the Washington Hours Convention, there will probably be a full disoussion in October on the action taken by the Governments. As my oolleagues are aware, a letter has been addressed to the Secretary-General setting out the difficulties in this country with regard to ratification and saying that tho Government propose to suggest to the International Labour Organisation that tho question might be reconsidered at a
future Conference, with a view to the adoption of a now and loss Inelastic Convention.   Tho Conference in Qotober may have to decide whether to entertain this proposal and if so whether to plaotf it on the Agenda of the 1922 Conference.   It is possible also that a suggestion may &quot;be made that the Conference should examine the difficulties experienced by Great Britain and other countries, and should assume the rolo of an inter-proting authority.   I suggest that the British Delegates bo instructed to oppose any attempt of this Conference to interpret the Washington Convention,   questions of interpretation are under Part XIII reserved for tho Court of International justice at the Hague.   If it is suggested, however, that the Conference should refer the question to a Committee of the Conference, whioh would review tho situation both as regards Great Britain and as regards the other oountries whioh find themselves in difficulties, I suggest that the British Delegates should bo instructed to welcome the proposal, provided Croat Britain had adequate representation on tho Committee,   suoh a Committee would he able to explore the ground, and it might well be that some practical solution as to the lines of a new Convention would emerge,(Sgd) MACEpLARA.Ministry of Labour. 12/8/21.
THIRD FPETTfrG OF THg GENERAL CONFERENCE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION, TO BE, HELD AT GENEVA; OCTOBER, 1931. Items 2, 15, 4, 5, 6, and 8 of the Agenda.DRAFT INSTRUCTIONS&apos;.0F HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT TO.THEIR DELEGATES ATTENDING THE MEETING *     &apos;imn.t^^-wtmw*--i*ti&apos;hini*mwu*n&quot;&apos; &quot;*-*&quot;*.&apos;*       -------1&quot;   1 r--- -t   -f-v&quot;-n--        .......-in  11m   nnin   ninti.....amu 111.11. 1. &quot; &quot;   y &apos;&quot;:; ;       ;  -   &apos;. \AGRICULTURAL QUESTIONS * \[(Items 2f 5jr and 4 of the Agenda).     -1.      General Considerations.A proposal may he made to delete some or all of the agricultural Items.   These proposals will probably take two shapes - (a) a proposal to exclude all the agricultural items: and (b) a proposal to exclude the first item on.hours from discussion/ but to adrit discussion of the other agricultural topics.   With regard to these proposals,&apos;H.M&apos;.. Government do not favour the proposal to exclude all agricultural topics from discussion as, having regard to the fact that employers1 and workers1 representatives are to be present, it is desirable that there should be complete freedom of discussion. The same considerations apply with regard to the proposal to exclude only the hours question from discussion.   Should any of the agricultural items prove -to be unsuitable for treatment by means of an international Convention or Recommendation, there will be an opportunity of voting against any proposed measure on those subjects at a later stage in the conferoaooo2. The question will arise as,to which classes ofarricultural workers draft conventions and recommendations should cover.   In the view of Hie Majestyfs Governmontall such proposals should apply to all wage earners working
under a contract of service, exceptions being allowed, whore necessary, in tho caso of day labourers doing piece work.Adaptation to Agricultural Labour of the Washington decis1one ooneerning the regulation of hours of work.Apart from the fact that Hie Majesty^ Government are not in a position to ratify the Washington Hours Convention, the question of rogulatlon of hours in agriculture presenta peculiar difficulties; and you should oppose the adoption of any Convention on the subject, and in opposing the following reasons may be adduced(a) Agricultural conditions are different in each country;(b) Agricultural work is dependent on natural causes, ouch as weather conditionsj(c) Any regulation of hours would bo difficult to be put into effective operation;(d) A long period regulation of hours is also&apos;open to objections.     In Scotland the period of engagement Is normally a year or six months.   In England and Wales, however, many agricultural workers are employed for only a few months and it would be possible for such workers to work a greater number of hours per week than the average working week during the period of their employment.   Further, one of the main principles underlying limitation of hours of work is that work should not go on so long as to produce excessive fatigue.   It does not appear that a long period regulation of hours would meet this objection effectively. The objections mentioned above would not apply to a Recommendation proposing that Governments should encourage local Organisations to determine, by voluntary agreement between employers and employed, the maximum number of
houro to bo worked,   having regard to special or natural conditions.Ad apt a t1 onto ,.a^rj^!jjL^^^j^S^ 5?f Ql &amp;l  Ldecisions concerning (a) Measures for the prevention of or providing against unemployment.(Item 3a of the Agenda).5. His Majesty^ Government have ratified the Washingtondraft convert ion concerning Unemployment.6. With regard, however, to the Recommendation concerningunemployment. His Majesty1s Government do not consider that the provisions of this measure can be adapted to agriculture.      Of its four Articles, the first two have been rejected entirely by the British Government, and of the remaining two, the one relating, to tho co-ordination of Putolic work doeB not appear to bo appropriate; and the other, relating to Unemployment Insurance, has been under consideration recently, by a strong Committee of Employers and workers.    The Employers oppose the application of tho unemployment Insurance Acts to agriculture, and the workers cannot   agcoe as to the methods by which they could be applied.    Furthermore, the risk of unemployment is less in agriculture than in industry and commerce.7. It may be expected that a proposal will be madoto examine such questions as tho extension and intensification of cultivation, small holdings, land settlements, transport facilities, home work, croation of co-operative societies etc    You should draw attention to the faot that these questions are ultra vires, having regard to the terras of the Agenda, and intimate that on that ground, if any discussion takes place, you do not propose to take part in it.
Adaptation to Agricultural Labour of the Washington(Iterrn 3 (b) of the Agenda).8. For reasons with which you are familiar the governments have not accepted the Washington Maternity Convention, You should, therefore, oppose the application of this Convention to Agriculture, making it clear at the same time that thero is in Great Britain an effective system which already applies to Agricultural Workers.9. With regard to the adaptation to Agriculture of thoWashington draft Convention concerning tho night work of women,   it does not appear that night ?ork in agriculture is injurious to health or otherwise undesirable.   H.M. Government are. nevertheless, not definitely opposed to the adaptation to agriculture of this draft Convention provided that provision ie made for allowing oarly morning work and exceptional work connected with tending of live stock? calving, lambing, otc.   In view, however, of tho difficulties with regard to control, it is very doubtfulwhether a draft Convention at all is desirable, and the British Government, at any rate at prosent, do not see their way to undertaking any elaborate syotem of inspoction. 10. H*M* Government aro prepared to support the adaptation to agriculture of the Washington Mifcimum Age Convention subject to the following modlfications(a) the minimum age for employment of any kind should be IS-(b) Restricted employment should be permissible between tho ages of IS and 14.   ^he restrictions might follow the lines of the provisions already in force in this country, i.e. work between 8 p.m0 and 6 a.m and during school hours should be prohibited. Sunday work should be limited to two hours.   One hour night be worked in the mornings if permitted by bye-law.&quot;&quot;*
(o)   A further oxcoption to the above should makeemployment hy parents permissible under bye-law. Ih With regard to the adaptation to agriculture of theWashington Convention concerning flight Work of Youn^ Persons? the remarks above concerning tho Slight Work of Women Convention, are also applicable to this Convention.Special measures for tho protection of Agricultural workers .(a) Technical agricultural oduoation.12. H.M. Government would be preparod to support a recommendation drafted in general terms aiming at tho Improvement of vocational and technical education among agricultural workers.   The text of such a Recommendation should not Include a recital of any special measures. Further, H.M. Government would be prepared to supply to Geneva available information on tho subject and a report under Article 408, ohould the Rocommendation be adopted. It is not considered necessary to supply spoolal reports on the eubjedt,(b)   Living in oondltlons of Agricultural workers.13. H*M* Government do not favour tho adoption of adraft Convention on this subject, but would be proparod to support a Recommendation which applied to - (i) workers provided with accommodation by their employers,   and (ii) workers lodging in the houses or adjoining buildings of their employers.   The housing conditions of other workers should not bo covered by such a proposal&apos;^as they come under the provisions applicable to the rural population generally.   The Sanitary and Public Health measures which apply to the rural population gonorally should apply also to classes (i) and (ii) above mentioned,   such &apos;   measures need not bo so strict in the country as in the towns.   Measures of control should take the same form as in the case of the general rural population.
(0)   guarantee of the rights of association and qomPl ration,H.M. Government see no objection to tho adoptionof the draft Convention on this subject following tho lines of the Trade Unions and Trade Disputes Acts in force in this oountry.   The adoption of such a Convention would not necessitate the introduction of fresh legislation in this country.(d)   Protect ion against accident, sickness) invalidity and old agOoH.Mi Government see no objection to the adoption of a draft convention on this subject following the lines of the national Health Ineuranco and. tho Workmen fs Compensation Acts in this country.   The adoption of such a Convention would not necessitate the introduction of fresh legislation in this country.II.. ... v. .DISINFECTION OF IVQOL ISFEGTBD WITH ANTHRAX SPORES *(item 5 of tho Agenda).H.M. Government strongly support tho adoption of a draft Convention on this subject.   Regulations for the protection of workers have proved inoffectivo and such a Convention should provide for the disinfection of wool at the earliest possible stage, proforably in the producing or exporting countrioBj and if this is not possible at selected ports in the importing countries, infectod wool should be allowed to ontor only at those ports and should not be released until disinfected.If tho proposal for tho appointment of a permanent International Commission is adopted, you-should propose that the Commission should take the form of an International Advisory oommittoe of Government representatives
PROHIBITION OF TKIi USE OF,WHITE LEAD IK POINTING* ; &apos;(-Itera 6 of the^ Agend a).Pending the report of the recently constituted Home Office&apos; Committee, you should-, not--commit yourself to a-draft Convention or Recommendation proposing-prohibit ion.&apos; Nevertheless, the -Conference; will dtscue-s tho possibility of prohibition and may adopt a draft convention or Recommendation on the subject.   Having regard to the possibility of a report by the Home &quot;-Off ice&apos; Committee that prohibition is practicable, it is desirable that the -Convention adopted by tho conference should be so framed as to bo acceptable to Great. Britain.  &quot;You should, therefore, while stating definitely that at the-moment you cannot commit the British Government to tho principle-cf prohibition, endeavour to obtain tho -acceptance of the following subsidiary &apos; principlest-(a) A question may arise as to whether -any draft Convention or Recommendation on this subject should apply to the painting Industry as a whole or to certain- bra no.ho s only. You should.&quot;&apos; - support the former alternative(b) The period to be allowed before prohibition comes: &apos;into foroe should be not less than throe years to permit of ;-  the adaptation of existing plant and. to allow for the &apos; &quot; training of workers in the uso of the new materials.(c) Control should be offacted by means of statute, or statutory -regulations providing for- penalties for contravention,systematic inspection.&quot; taking of o amp Ice and notificationby doctors of all cases of dead poisoning. If prohibition is not carried and there is the necessary majority of the Conference in favour of regulation, tho delegates should do their best to mako^ueh regulations as effeotive arid practicable as possible.
IT.MUDO^NgTIE MaRIMS QUESTIONS. (Item B of the  genjteh(a)   The prohibition of the employment- of any -person under the age of 18 years as trimmer or stoker.21. B.M. Government are prepared to support a draftConvention probibiting the employment of any person under the age of 18 years as trimmer or stoker.    (Df the ship-owners press for an exception being made for eases of emergency, this can be agreed to,(&quot;k )   Compulsory medical examination of all^ children employed on board ship.28, If the proposal referred to in 21 above is not adopted, R.M. Government would be prepared to support a draft Convention providing for raedioal examination on their first entry into the service of all young persons under 18 who are to be employed as trimmer or stoker,23. With regard to other employment on board ship,H.M. Government are prepared to support a Convention making medical examination of children under 16 compulsory on first entry into the service.24. If the Conference favours a Convention making the age18 instead of 16, you. need not object to this but should stipulate that the Convention should only require medical examinations on first entry into the service.    She question of making such examination periodical should be deferred for examination in the light of future experience.
