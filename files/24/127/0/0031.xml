[This Document is the Property of His Jfritannic^ Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet   August 1921.125SECRET.C.F. 3230.CABINET.RELATIONS BETWEEN IRISH LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD.MEMORANDUM BY THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND.I CIRCULATE to the Cabinet three communications which I have received from Sir Henry Robinson, the Yice-President of the Local Government Board for Ireland, regarding the present attitude of the Local Authorities in Ireland towards the Local Government Board.These papers show very clearly the nature of the difficulties that will have to be faced before it will be possible to return to normal conditions of local government in that country.H irish Office, S.W. 1,August 16, 1921.I.Local Government Board for Ireland, My dear Chief, 33, St. Stephen&apos;s Green, N., Dublin, August 6, 1921.In reply to your enquiry as to the situation between the Local Government Board and the local authorities on the 1st August, I regret to say that there is no change for the better.The annexed memorandum gives full particulars in detail.I threw out a feeler to some of the Councils whose officers are still loyal to us, and one and all have taken the same view that no rapprochement would be permitted pending Sinn Fein announcement of the terms of peace, and, judging from the attitude and public utterances of local authorities at present, it seems doubtful whether, even if peace is achieved, the local authorities will recognise the existing law and comply with their statutory obligations unless the Government make it part of the conditions of peace that they should do so.Of late the Dail Eireann Local Government officials have become more truculent and dictatorial than ever. Without any foresight as to the ultimate consequences they are bullying the Councils into closing workhouses and infirmaries and transferring inmates from one place to another.Dail Eireann inspectors go round giving directions to local authorities, and any refusal on the part of Boards of Guardians to obey even the most short-sighted orders, they are told, will be regarded as a want of confidence in Dail Eireann.These schemes must involve a failure to provide hospital treatment to many people, but, unfortunately, the case of the sick and destitute seems to have become quite a secondary consideration. A very fair sample of this is given in the annexed extract from our inspectors report from Swinford: &quot;As I had read about cases being refused in the infirmary and a man, James Prendergast, explained his case to me, I called on Dr. Staunton, dispensary doctor for the town. From him and from the reports of board meetings in the local press I gather the following facts:  .&quot; All medical officers of health and all sanitary officers have now been formally dismissed, in addition to not having received any salary since September 1920. No drugs have been procurable also for the last six months. The so-called able-bodied inmates have been turned out, and there have been many cases of great hardships and bodily suffering as a consequence. No one is admitted to the infirmary except by direct permission of the medical officer, who, acting with and under direction of the chairman, refuses all but the severest cases. The medical officer has drastically dealt with the scale of rations, reporting weekly the consumption of the leading articles of diet to the board; owing to some difference of opinion with the board the master16787 *
lias been forced to surrender the store-keys to the matron and has been continually insulted by the chairman. Under the plea of economising, the board, and more especially the chairman, are disregarding their duties as guardians of the poor and causing an immense amount of suffering.&quot; Lately, owing to heavy rain, a sewer in the town lias become blocked, and as there are no sanitary officers the local councillors were appealed to to authorise the necessary expenditure, but none would do so, and from a personal inspection of the sewer and the houses which were flooded, I should say there is a risk of an epidemic arising should further floods take place.&quot;Free medical assistance to the poor is in some districts a thing of the past. The dispensary doctors have received no salaries for months, and naturally will not attend &quot;red ticket cases&quot; without a fee. Road workmen are kept out of their wages, and although rates have been increased to cover the loss of the local taxation grants, many of the persons collecting them are not legally appointed collectors, and the rates are therefore coming in slowly and some councils are in perpetual financial straits.The manner in which officers who desire to fulfil their statutory obligations  foreseeing the after-effects of the present negation of the law is most deplorable.Their salaries and fees are withheld, and every effort is made to worry them into vacating their positions.I have already informed you of the prohibition of Dail Eireann against local officials doing any registration work. This step, if successful, in preventing a new register from being compiled would mean that the sense of the majority of the people would not be obtained at the next election. The real truth is that the local Sinn Fein terrorists are so elated at the sway they have established and at the power of life, death and destruction which they wield that they have become utterly reckless as to the results of anything they may decide upon, and I believe that De Valera and Co. will have no easy task before them when he has to endeavour to bring them into line for the re-establishment of legitimate administration.All the forced amalgamations of unions and the transfer of inmates has involved illegal expenditure which will invalidate the rates if they should hereafter be challenged; and if and when an audit does take place the amount of illegal payments struck out and surcharged will inevitably be very heavy.Presumably Dail Eireann counts on being able when it comes into power to bring in an Act validating all these illegal payments, remitting surcharges and confirming unauthorised appointments, and the ratepayers at large will have to make up the losses caused by the misapplication of money under the Sinn Fein regime.Even so it will take a long time to bring order out of chaos and to re-establish the local authorities on a satisfactory financial basis unless local administration is carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act.I would again urge upon you that if there is to be peace and a transfer of local administration to a southern Parliament, and if the Government is to be handed over as a going concern, it should be one of the conditions of peace that the Local Government Board is to be supported and not obstructed by Dail Eireann in restoring financial order and making the final transitory arrangements.Yours sincerely,H.

President,The annexed copy of report from our Inspector in the West is very interesting as showing the attitude of the local authorities towards the Local Government j Board.H. A. RLocal. Government Board, Dublin, August 9, 1921.Counties of Roscommon, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo and Bawnboy (cavan).Attitude of Local Authorities towards Local Government Board Officialsduring Truce.Since the truce started I have visited eleven out of the eighteen Unions and three of the County Councils in my area. Of the Unions three belong to Roscommon, two to Sligo, two to Leitrim and four to Mayo. At the time, of the eighteen only one, namely, Boyle, acknowledged the Local Government Board, and this Union has since again repudiated the Board.Unions and Rural District Councils.I was received, as usual, with every courtesy by the clerks and masters, but in none of the ten was I allowed to examine books or to enter the workhouse buildings for inspection purposes. It was invariably pointed out what grave risks the officials concerned would ran, should I be allowed to do so. As a personal conces- , sion certain questions were answered, but generally speaking, when a vital subject was broached there was hesitation and silence. All invariably hoped for a speedy, lasting peace, but a peace under a purely Irish Government. All internal questions such as nominations to posts, salaries, &amp;c, are being referred to the Local Govern-ment Department, Dail Eireann, the latter&apos;s inspectors attend the meetings, demand returns and threaten penalties if communications are sent to the Local Govern -ment Board, but to my knowledge no auditor from that body has as yet acted in this area.County Councils.These bodies, similarly, show no sign of wishing to change their attitude, and though they are all in financial difficulties they do not ask for help. The officials, with the exception of the Roscommon secretary, who has been virtually suspended -for the last six months, are very reserved and afford practically no information. Through the action of the Local Government Department, Dail Eireann, the County Councils now dominate and dictate to their Unions by means of the threat of withholding the instalments due.Summing up the situation, I should say that the return of members hitherto absent has, as in Boyle, distinctly hardened their attitude.Sligo, August 8, 1921.iii.Local Government Board for Ireland, My dear Chief, 33, St Stephens Green, N., Dublin, August 10, 1921.In connection with what you wrote about a rapprochement between the Local Government Board and the County Councils, I hear from some of our inspectors that the question is now being asked on all sides whether as one of the results of peace they will be extricated from the difficulty created by the Garnishee Orders.At present people have been warned that if they apply for Garnishee Orders, they and their solicitors will be shot, and if they attempt to execute those they have already obtained they may expect the same fate.When peace comes their fear is that the Garnishee Orders will come down upon them like snowflakes, and as it is quite likely that they will approach you on the subject of how this disaster is to be avoided, I write to remind you that you can point out to them that a renewal of the negotiations with the Local Government Board means that they can at once get the repayment extended over
five years. That is all we can promise for the present, and in most cases it will relieve the financial deadlock. It would be unthinkable to do anything to deprive the people whose property lias been burnt of their just compensation, but that, I am afraid, is what some of the local authorities hope.All the same, these charges are entirely out of proportion to the damage done, as the local authorities did not defend them, and I really think that when peace is established there must be some enquiry for the purpose of finding a basis for revising claims and for consideration of the question of how the amount which falls upon the ratepayers, beyond their ability to pay, should be dealt with.It is a task which I should be personally much interested in and would be glad to undertake if necessary.Yours sincerely,H. A. ROBINSON.Note.A person who has obtained a decree against a County Council for compensation for criminal injuries is entitled to obtain from the High Court an order attaching the rates payable by any particular ratepayer to the Council in satisfaction of the amount recovered by his decree. This right was conferred as an additional remedy by section 3 of &quot; The Criminal Injuries (Ireland) Act, 1920.&quot; The order for attachment is commonly known as a Garnishee Order.The following is the text of the order issued by Dail Eireann in regard to this matter: &quot; Dail Eieeann.&quot; To all holders of Decrees of Enemy Courts for Criminal and Malicious Injuries;&quot; To all who have secured or are about to secure &apos; Garnishee Orders &apos;;&quot; To Solicitors acting on behalf of such persons; and&quot; To all others whom it may concern, This Solemn Warning:-   .&quot; The existence of the Red Cross and the well-known inviolability of military hospitals are evidence that in civilised warfare the sick and wounded, even of the combatant forces, and the organisation that cares for them, is regarded as sacred. By every humanitarian principle and by accepted custom, the vital health services of the civilised community are regarded as similarly sacred and above interference from combatants.&quot; In the war which the British Government is waging upon the Irish people, however, this is not to be so. That Government now designs, by appeals to individual selfishness, to circumvent civilised custom, and to add an organised war upon the sick, the infirm, and the indigent, to the midnight assassinations and the wanton murders of which it is already guilty.&quot; The rates struck and the moneys levied and collected by the local governing authorities are for the express purpose of providing for the essential services of the community water supply, food transit, poor relief and health services. To divert these moneys so that they may no longer be available for the purposes for which they were levied is to attempt the life of the community to make war upon the sick and the helpless poor, upon the mother, the infant, and the aged. Those who act as agents and instruments of the enemy in this attempt and take part in this despicable and infamous war are guilty of the highest crime against the State, and all who by decrees obtained in enemy courts, by Garnishee Orders, or other enemy device are thus guilty, are hereby warned that they will be dealt with accordingly and proceeded against with all the forces that the people&apos;s Government can command.&quot; For the malicious injuries done by the forces of the British government, that Government alone not the local communities is responsible, and from that Government satisfaction must be sought. In any peace that will end this struggle this responsibility of that Government must be acknowledged, and just com-pensation made to the individuals injured. In the case of injuries to individuals ( and property caused by the necessary operations of the National Forces, the Home Government will see at the proper time that the loss is distributed over the nation as a whole.- (Signed) &quot;L. T. Mao Cosgaib,&quot; Minister f07&apos; Local Govem?nent.&quot; (L.S.) ^_o
