To meet the increased costs due to the war and its consequences, I have, under the powers conferred upon me, increased the maximum charging powers of certain Canals, Tramways, and Harbour, Dock and Pier Undertakings.     The action in question was taken under the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, the Tramways (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act, 1920, and the Harbours, Docks and Piers (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act, 1920.     The powers under these Acts operate only until the 15th February, 1923, after which date, in the absence of statutory provision, the undertakings referred to above will revert to their pre-war charging powers.2.     There is no probability that by the 15th February, 1923, costs will have fallen to such a level as to enable the undertakings to carry on with their normal charging powers. Falling public legislation, it will be necessary for each undertaking to give notice this autumn of the introduction of a Private Bill in tho session of 1922 to authorise an increase in charging powers.     The promotion of Private Bills would impose heavy expenditure which it is stated by the Canal Association would in some oases be prohibitive.3.      The question of principle involved is whether Parliament is to abandon in the case of these undertakings as in the case of railways the practice of regulating charges by maxima fixed by statute for each undertaking and substitute some more flexible machinery whether the order  of a
Minister or the decision of a Tribunal.     While there is in the meantime much to be said in favour of not attempting to fix maxima in the existing abnormal conditions provided the oost of any alternative administrative or Judicial machinery is borne by the undertakings concerned, I consider that this is a general question which should properly be left for my successor to bring before the Cabinet.In the meantime, however I think the undertakings should be relieved of the necessity of introducing bills next session which in the event of general legislation may prove unnecessary, and in any   event would block the Private Bill Committee Machinery very much.I recommend, therefore) that a promise should be given to the undertakings that If the question i3 not otherwise dealt with by Parliament the Government will pass a measure continuing to February 15th 1924, in respect of Canals the charging powers which would otherwise expire on Febrriary 15th 1923, and as to tramways and docks and harbours would include the acts In the Expiring Laws Continuance Act.SD, im GfcDDEi      ;ministry of Transport, 6, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1..7th August, 1921.
