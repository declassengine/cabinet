Total: -12 battalions5 squadrons2 groups of artillery2 air squadronsHowever the British military representative in accordance*       with the reconnaissances -carried out in this area by the3ritish and French staffs by order of General Baringtonconsiders that the total force necessary should consist oftwo divisions, namely about:16 battalions 5 squadrons 6 groups of artillery 2 air squadronsThd British air representative considers on the other handthat it would be advisable to reinforce the air formationsmentioned above by one squadron of giant bombers.hon o fshe Naval &apos;i&apos;hese would, by means of their artillery armament,support the wings of the operating forces, and would carry out the task of watching and policing the sea4It must be pointed out that in view of the extent of the zone- to be defended (100 kilometres long with a depth of 45 kilometres) the force contemplated above could.only fulfil/its mission if the enemy attacked with limited means..    Such would be : the case for instance, if the Turxish army pursuing- the Greek army in the direction of Smyrna with the bulk.,of its forces (main operation) entrusted to, a detached force the mission of reaching the southern shores of the Straits (secondary operation).But it is very obvious that if the enemy allotted to this last operation very important forces, it would be impossible to&apos;guarantee the freedom of the Straits with the force mentioned above,In this situation this force would only exert a delaying action for a length of time which,  though necessarily limited, cannot be estimated.In4       Information communicated to It. Gol. Heywood.
In order to re-establish the freedom of the Straits, it would then be necessary to utilise more powerful forces which would no doubt have to be employed from a new base of operations.

Further it must clearly be understood that the preceding proposals only hold good in the present situation where the principal Allied Powers are not in a state of war with Greece.

They are not,, ooro.plete . - :1.    The si-situation as regards .the, disbandment. of the Self-Defence (Selbstschutz) Defence 1 Organisations, remains obscure.    Germany has declared these organisations dissolved, hut has not yet&apos; pro-Tided a list, and in consequence the control of the aboliticn of these units is made very difficult.    In particular,  the Societies-affiliated to the &quot;ORSESCH&quot; have not been enumerated. Consequently, as matters stand at present, Sermsny can still count on a really strong reserve. - thanks t&amp; these Organisations which are composed of a large number of volunteers. 2.    The effectives of the Police have not yet &quot;been reduced to the number fixed by the- Boulogne Hote, and the police which are still in existence are of a military mobile character, which is contrary    to the decision of the Boulogne Note.    The German-Government.., in spite of the decisions which have been&apos;notified to them concerning this question, have asked, and still ask explanations and. addl tional details.      In this way the, time is prolonged during which the police form an additional body,iequal in strength to the Reichsheer, capable of forming cadres of officers and -2I*C0&apos;s to  the reserves of volunteers. 5.    The transformation of i factories to commercial usesis still delayed under various pretexts and thus the passible&apos; production of war material remains a danger. 40    The control of the delivery of material declared by the German Government is not finished.    This w^rk is carried out , at 200 centres of destruction and 300 Depots ef material, which dees not include Units of the Army and police formations which are even more numerous..x. Of a tctal-of 7000 factories- Which are know/n at present to have,- manufactured war material, 2000 remain to be visited; -.5000 have been visited or are about to be visited, but in ^he-case of a few of the more important factories,  the necessary destruction will not be accomplished before the end of 1922V^.
i),   Moreoverdt--is-Imp^-s^ble^t-c^^^ thematerial.declared &quot;by the German -rGcnrel-nme^rit, and thev-^rt-e^^allied Military Commission of Control hay not.yet been able to obtain the original or basic details (Lists showing the armaments at the time of the armistice), which are,.Indispensable in order, ta arrive at the degree of disarmament which has been obtained, as regards material,6.,   ^ Finally,  the delivery and destruction -of certain materials (wagons, bridging material,  field bakeries,   etc.)  are obviously incomplete. ...B,    The resume&apos; which is given below and which ouly covers the essential points shoWs that the results obtained are still incomplete.    These results are however only temporary and they will remain temporary,  even -when the above mentioned shax-t-o-omin^i have  -been rectified for the following reasons:-la     The Self Defence (Selbstschutz) units which have been dissolved can be easily reconstituted,  if a strict control is not for a sufficient time,, maintained/   The Reichsheer and the police can carry out militaryinstruction for a. large number of volunteers by means offalsifying leave returns and returns of men discharged&apos;.    Thusnot only can the existing reserves continue,  but they can increase2.      The German Government has tried up to the present tokeep under a civil heading the largest possible number ofofficers and military officials,   and to leave    in the Central -Administration and t-r* the auxiliary services the minimum cadresnecessary for mobilization.    The examination of a normal budgetwhich cannot be done until 1922 (the budget of 1921 being stillabnormal), would help to ascertain whether the German Governmentwere keeping to their legal srganisaticns. . This is a point which should be emphasised0
3,     War material oan be increased fairly quickly.,  firstly &quot;by manufacture,  and secondly by means cf importation.It will consequently be necessary to set up a control /organisation that will last for some considerable time.3?rsm the preceding brief summary cf the situation the following conclusion has been reached:The Inter-Allied Military Mission of dontrol in Germany has hot yet completed its task.   As regaris the date of the complete exo-outisn of its work-, ho definite fcregast .oan yet be made.    On the one hand, it is neoeasaiy to take into account the goodwill,or otherwise of the German Government whose attitude has for the last eighteen months Varied . considerably, and,  riuite reoently, after having been satisfactory for Bb&amp;e time with goed results,  again shows signs of reaction. On the other hand,  vide the above statement,  the original statements (lists rif armament of November 1918) have not. yet been supplied,  and consequently it is not possible to form an exact opinion as to the complete nature cf the surrenders of material which have been made.

It is intended to redude the -Sub^C*mxli-s.sitn. of Fortifications (20 officers) &quot;by 5C^ by next N&amp;november, and to&apos; dissolve it in January 1922..A considerable reduction (at least 50 -officers out of 180) can be carried out in the. Arra^an^-nierSub^^ by January, 1922.Further reductions are contempiated,  but can cjsly be carried out if the German Government assists in the complete and loyal execution of the Treaty.   IT 9 exact details can be given at the present time .(2)    To hasten the execution of the military clauses of the Peace Treaty by reminding the Gex-man&apos;Government of the engagements which it has already given.(3)   In these circumstances it seems at the present time premature to lay dewnthe exact method in which the future central Of the military execution of ijhe Treaty will be -carried out..

APPENDIX,. V. gFIDENTIAJW. &quot;J. 303.&quot;- REPORT OF&quot; THE&quot;- JXngGh4$iE&amp; MHiEBSRfc *J0mSSE0irOF YSRSjUIJES ON THE AIF.-*q0esttons.PART I,F OS ITT ON 0F1(THS. WORK,ACCOMPLISHED El THE I.A.A.CC.The position is that all tho known&apos;aeronautical material is now in the hands of the Reiohstrauhandgesallschaft.. I.e. the crgan charged by the German Government with carrying eut the delivery or destruction of this material,     Nc? questions i^f principle are at present outstanding with the German Govern-ment, and the work of delivery and destruction is proceeding-normally under the supervision.of the Control officers. This supervision centimes to be necessary,  as even under supervision a certain quantity of material is constantly disappearing.      In addition to the known material, small quantities &amp;t undeclared material continue to come to light, either as the result of legal measures taken by the German Government,  or as the result of information which reaches the Commission of Control,,,This undeclared material when found has to be disposedof..The material to be dealt with by the aeronautical Commission may he divided into two principal categories:-(A) Aircraft and accessories.(B) Install atlc-ns,  such as sheds and Hydrogen Plants. (A) may further he divided as referred to above into (i) known material and (il) undeclared materialsAs regards A.(i) the work is very nearly completed, and is expected to be entirely finished by the beginning of next month, with the exception of aeronautical armament, the &apos;: final dispo-s-al of which may take somewhat longer.-
As regards A (ii) this is--m^uriknaTOi;.-^a-ct^r-.     All--that can be said is that in many cases the total amount of material surrendered by the German Government does not agree with what was expected to be founds -;The latest German law on the subject has fixed August 15th as the date by which, under.severe penalties, all material held back must be surrendered.,     This Is the third law of the kind,  and when this has expired,   all legal-methods to bring cut this material will have been exhausted.The Commission by its own methods is only finding negligible quantities of material,It may therefore be said that&apos; also in September 1921 everything possible will have been done In&apos; this respect.Lastly as regards (B) tho work of demolishing the large and numerous installations in Germany has taken longer than was anticipated, and though the work is well advanced, supervision is still necessary t*  ensure that the demolitions are thoroughly carried out, and that the installations are not left In such a state that their reconstruction is facilitated. This supervision must continue for some considerable time, depending on the degree of thoroughness In clearing up required to be attained.The position of the work accomplished by tho I-A.A.CC Is therefore considered to be as follows:&quot;The military air Power of Germany has been broken, but the resulting debris h- s not yet been finally disposed oj and if left in its present stage might render it easier for Germany t!) rebuild a certain Power In the air from the remaining fragments&quot;.

This period of three months,  would it Is considered, be required for the  actual final clearing up of all outstanding matters by a reduced section of the Commission.      Included in these matters is the  completion of the Commission^ report on its work, .Under these circumstances it is proposed that :-(1).    The Inter-Allied Aeronautical Commission of Control will be reduced on the 30th of September to 15 Officers. (2),    The Inter-Allied Aeronautical Commission of Control will &apos; finish the work and leave Germany on the 31st.December 1921, and that the embargo on the construction of German aircraft will be withdrawn from this date.(3).
