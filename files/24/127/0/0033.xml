a).Wote of interview with Members of the Russian Tra&amp;e. ])e legation at 10, Downing Street, S,V-!. August 5th, 1921,EBBS b 1 fi&quot; BRITISH, RUSSIAN,The Prime Minister,     , M, Bersin,Mr. E*3?. Wise, C,B, m, Slishko.Sir Edward Grigg,Sir Robert Home and Sir Maurice Hankey were present during part of the meeting.The Prime Minister asked M, Bersin to begin,-M, BERSIH (translated throughout by M, KlisKko) said that he had asked for an interview because he had been informed that the subject of relief for the r:ussian famine v/as to be discussed by the Supreme Council in Paris the following week.    He made a statement on the extent and gravity of the famine, handing in certain maps and statistics,.  !CH2 mm MBISTISR asked what, in.M, Bersin*s opinion, the Supreme Council could do,M. BERSIN replied that they had come to ask that.   He explained that they thought they could get sufficient grain for sowing next Spring, but could not deal with the immediate need for food,   Transport was the main difficulty, but they were also unable to get grain from some Russian provinces which had a surplus because the peasant vsould only surrender it in return for goods - such as woollen clothing, boots, agricultur-al implements, etc, - vMoh he needed, - Could the British people help in supplying goods ?THE  RIME MINISTER pointed out that this raised the question of credit,   WoulcV the Sot let Covewnment acknowledge the Russian debt f
H. BER3IH said he would make enquiries.Some discussion followed as to vnether Russia had any produce suoh as timber anG jute available for export.THE PRIME MINISTER then adjourned to discuss the subject privately with tho Chancellor of the Exchequer, for whom he had sent.On returning, THE ElBffi MINISTER said he would like fcfru Bersin and JCLishko to state their oase to Sir PhilipLloyd-Greame, whom he had instructed to make a report to him on the possibility of giving assistance. , The Prime Minister then referred to the propaganda and hostile activity of the Soviet Government, contrary to the Trade -Agreement,K. BEKSIH said individual Russians, whom the Government could not control, might be doing so, but not the Government itself *    as evidence of bona fides, he handed in a copy of K. TchitcherinTs instructions to the Soviet delegates in Afghanistan.THE PRIME MIIUSTSE said it was acknowledged that Russians on the. Third International, including M. Trotski, were stirring up trouble against, us.&apos; M. BBR3IH said some members of Russian Government were also members, of the :2hird International hut only as individuals.    They were forbidden even to take any action inconsistent with the obligations of the Government, suoh as the Trade Agreement.THE PRIMS MINISTER said he hoped they would endeavour to exercise better control and play the game.   The British people wanted peace throughout the world.   They had no quarrel with the Russian people, and they believed that the only way of improving the lot of humanity, particularly of its more stricken millions, lay in the attainment of as large a measure of fraternity as humanity was capable of. ,He said he would communicate any particular instances \ of bad faith, on the -part-of the Soviet Government which were
reported to hinuThe cLelagation then withdrew, Mr, FTise taking the mapsand statements on the famine for communication to sir philip Lloyd-Orouio.(Intel), B.W.H.a.
RELIEF FOR RUSSIAN FAMINE * Meeting at Board of Trade, 6th August, 1921.*H WO m* m* &amp;*   -.w   *l Hi M IK        W * W ^ W M  x   1*present sir P. Lloyd-Oreame, Sir E.A. Crowe, Sir S.J. Chapman, Mr. Payne, Mr. Wise, Commander Maxae, Mr. Reyntiens, tfaptain Clively.Also : Mm, Crysin, Berzin, Kli3hko.Area In question.     Maps were shown In which were indicated(a) the famine area,(b) area of inadequate harvest,(c) area of normal harvest,(d) harvest which allowed of surplus.Sir P. Lloyd-Sreame suggested that there appeared to b** sufficient ??heat in Rucsia In the aggregate to meet immediate needs, but the Russian Delegates demurred, pointing out that there had not been enough for last year and there was still an adverse balance to be made up.The Delegates pointed out that their desire was to have grain imported into the ports such as Petrograd, Odessa, and the Crimea, for the supply of the adjacent areas, so that the com grown there might be moved into the famine stricken districts.As regards Southern Russia, the proposal was to import supplies both from abroad and from Siberia.    As regards the region about Kiev (Southern Ukraine) this part was self-sufficing and a certain proportion of the grain would be*4*
taken from there to go into the famine area.    Further the   j area round the Sea of Auof, and also Siberia, wore destined to supply the famine territory.,Difficulties involved,     Sir P. Lloyd-Greame said that it appeared to he mainly a question of transport, hut the Russian Delegation pointed out that, in addition, there was the question of insufficiency of supply, and they said -that if the ports could be put into as good a trim as-possible for the handling of Imports of grain, then that would provide a partial&quot;, solution of the transport difficulty.As regards the rivers and canals, they were mainly frozen from October till April, and the almost sole means of transport would be by railway, ,The Railways in Northern Russia   were a3 follows:-(a) Murmansk Line - Petrograd, which -served, theNorth, including Vologda,(b) The Archangel Line.(c) Reval-Petrograd.(d) Riga-Moscow,(e) Libau-Moscow. end(f) Line from the Finnish Ports to Petrograd. Prom Petrograd there was a double line to Moscow. In all these esses the permanent way is in a fairlygood condition, but there is a shortage of locomotives. The total pre-war number was 17,000 and this has now been reduced .to .5,000 or 6,000.    The Russians have placed an order in Germany for 500 or 600, for delivery to begin this month and extend over the next twelve months.    Some of these locomotives were aald to be ready, but Poland was making a difficulty about their transit.As regards waggons, the question had not been closely looked into, but it was thought that there were as many as their existing locomotives could haul.     It was also stated that 5,000 or 4000 waggons had been built in Canada for the late Russian Government and vnre held there by the Dis-posals Board.    Also there were about 100 locomotives in the
United States, &quot;Men oould not be delivered pending settlement as to price.The centre and south of the famine area are comparatively (for Russia) well served in respect of railways by the lines Moscow-Simbirsk-Ufa, Moscow-Simbirsk-Samara, Moscow-Saratov, Moscow-Tsaritsyn-Astrakhan.&apos;    Vlatka Is only indirectly connected with Moscow, by a branch line meeting the Petrograd-Vlatka-Perm railway at Vologda,    There Is a north to south connecting line running from Kazan to the Crimea, a little to the west of the famine area.There were also the following lines Odessa-Kharkov.The lines from the d&apos;azof ports to Kharkov. Krementchug-Kharkov-Line *FUEL.A difficulty had arisen through having to change the fuel for the locomotives.    On certain lines the engines had originally been designed for oil fuel but they had had to be converted   for coal, and again In the case of these and some other locomotives wood fuel eventually had to be adopted in lieu of coal.    On the whole it would be difficult to make up the wastage of locomotives by repair work.    On the other hand, Sir P.Lloyd Greamo pointed out that itwould be useless to give out contracts for new locomotives because it would be from 9 to 12 months before they would be ready for delivery; and the Russian delegation laid stress on the need of their repair shops for spare parts, fittings and fuel.
(.4)   TRANSPORT DIFFICULTIES THIS YEAR AND LAST.     Mr. Wise pointed out that the situation as regards locomotives was much the same this year as last year but that the rolling stock would be less absorbed in military operations.Sir Eyre Crowe suggested that supplies for troops were now being moved to the Caucasus for the support of the Turkish Nationalists.    This fact complicated difficulties in tranaport-ihg food to-famine areas.    Mr. Klishko said an official denial had been given by the Russian Government to the report that military movements were taking place.DISTRIBUTION.    Sir P.Lloyd-Greame pointed out that in the south there appeared to.be four lines of railways running approximately parallel by which the famine area could be served, separated each from the other by areas of from 50-120 miles broad.    How then would the food which was convoyed by rail, be distributed throughout the country.    Mr. Klishko suggested that the peasants would transport with horses. Sir P.Lloyd Greame asked whether the horses were not all dying of famine.    Mr. Klishko Said no doubt many were dying and that motor transport would be required for this purpose!   they had some but hot enough.     There was by the way plenty of petrol available.    How far motor transport could be used in winter required consideration, (6)   MEANS OF SECURING SURPLUS SUPPLIES,.Mr. Kllshko said that they did not intend to make com-pulsory requisitions of corn beyond thd statutory levy.    They proposed to persuade the peasants to surrender the further surplus by giving them goods in exchange
The goods required would be cloth, boots, tools end-smalleragricultural and other implements.    Larger agricultural implements would be distributed to co-operative Societies.)   qOODS REQUIRED.The Delegates gave the following rough figures as totheir requirementsWheat, for food    ......... 2,000,000 Tonstt      &quot;    seed...........      80.000  11Coal.................. 1,000,000 worth.Cloth..................... 2,000,000   &quot;Boots.................... 1,500,000   &quot;Agricultural implements and machinery.............. . 4,000,000   nMotor Lorries, - amount not certain.Chemicals including fertilisers etc and medicines ....... 1,000,000   &quot;Cattle for breeding .......Of these goods the Russians propose to purchase thewheat outside this country as they understood It would beimpossible to make purchases here.    They could buy inthe United Kingdom the coal, cloth, boots and motor lorries,and the small agricultural implements up to  750,000.The remainder, which would consist of such implements asthreshers, binders, etc would be obtained from the UnitedStates, and Canada.     They would supply a complete liston Monday.    The list might include. British goods up to 10,000,000.
(7)   PROPOSALS FOR OBTAINING GOODS.The Russians suggested that the Export Credits Scheme should be extended to their country, and they offered to pay Ibi down of the price of the goods they were to obtain, with85$ credit.Sir P. Lloyd-Greame put the following questions to them(a) would they acknowledge their existing debts?In reply they said that they could not go beyond the Trade Agreement* and that this could be discussed at PeacetTreaty negotiations.    Pressod further on this, they said that they would refer the question to Moscow.(b) what security would they give1, supposing the Scheme should be extended to Russia?They offered Bills of the Russian Co-operative Society Limited (ArcoS Ltd.) the capital of which they declared to be  100,000, * the Bills to be endorsed by M. Kraesin as Commissar of foreign Trade.    The Bills would be promises to pay in  !s sterling within three years, according to the provisions of the Act.(c) wh8t collateral could they supply?They offered to obtain, if possible, the signature to the Bills of the Central Union of Russian Co-operative Societies, which they explained was an entirely separate concern from the Company in this country, but they could not give any assurance as to the assets of this concern. They rare of opinion that the credit offered was sufficient, but thsy could not offer any tangible security which could be realised in event of default.Sir Philip pressed the delegation as to whether they could not offer tangible collateral security which could be realised in case of default, e.g. Gold or the proceeds of sale of timber and other exports..    The delegation stated that they were not prepared to offer any security beyond the endorsement of the Soviet Government.
They required their gold and other resources fbr&apos; other purchases, particularly of grain.    They could make no further offer without reference to Moscow. (8)   CONCLUSION.Sir P. Lloyd-Greame summed up the position by pointing out that they could noi, at least at present^ undertake to acknowledge their debts1, but that at the same time they Were asking for further credit on the word of the Soviet Government. He went on to point out that every application under the Export Credits Scheme had to be submitted to and scrutinised by the Advisory Committee which consisted of Bankers and Merchants.    This Committee put a value on the security offered and it was an essential part of the Scheme that half the uncovered risk was to bo taken by the Exporter in this country.    He added that the proposition put forward by the delegation did not appear to afford .a security which a Business Committee would regard as adequate.The Delegation said that they would endeavour to lay before the Board shortly revised and detailed figures about their requirements and as to their plans for relieving the famine.    They also stated that they would communicate with Moscow as to the recognition of debts and the provision of security, and that If they had a further proposal to make they would ask for a further interview.Board of Trade,6th August, 1921.
RUSSIAN FAMIIO.The; following is a short summary of the facts elicited at the meeting this morning,(l) The aggregate Russian harvest is insufficient to meet the famine.   Extent of deficit uncertain. ,Possible requirements tentatively put at 2,000,000 tons.-.(2) Russians propose to import  rain in the/Forth to supply the shortage in Petrograd area, and through Black Sea ports so as to substitute imported corn for corn taken from the Ukraine to the famine area.(3) Problem essentially one of transport.   Locomotives 5,000 to 5,000 against normal 17,000.   The only locomotives obtainable in the next twelve months are 500 or 600 from Germany and possibly 100 from America.   Locomotive repairs can only be relied on to keep tho present number working.(4) Supply of waggons much below normal, but as many as locomotives can deal with.(5) Permanent way worst in South-east, i.e. famine area(6) River transport frozen October to April.   There-fore all transport in critical period by rail.(7) Very doubtful if adequate means of distribution from railway dumps in famine area.   Railways 50 to 120 miles apart.(0) Uncertain if distributing organisation adequate to use such facilities as are available.(9) Russians put table of requirements roughly as followsmeat, for food...........;...........2,000:000 Tons.&quot;        &quot;   seed.......................     80,000   &quot;Coal...............................    1,000,000 worth.Cloth.............&apos;.................    2,000,000     &quot;Boots..............................    1,500,000     &quot;Agricultural implements and machinery 4,000,000     &quot; Motor Lorries - amount not certainChemicals including fertilisers.etc, and medicines..............      1,000,000    &quot;
(10) They propose to distribute cloth, boots and agricultural implements to peasants who have surplus corn in order to induce them to part with it.Uncertain if distribution will be effective. (-11) They propose to purchase grain for cash if not obtainable otherwise,   they will pay cash, for German locomotives.   They want coal, cloth, boots, lorries and the smaller agricultural implements from TM** on credit.(13) They ask for Export Credits Sonerae to b&amp; extended to Russia, but.(a) not prepared to acknowledge debts.(b) not prepared to find, any real security, o.g. gold or proceeds of sale of produce.and merely offer guarantee of Soviet Government endorsed by Centro-Soyus.But will refer to -&quot;oscovr on both these points. (13) It is clear there is no real security. If wc accepted the Russian proposal.( i) We should be giving then more favourable conditions than we give to other countries.(ii) &apos;7e should be giving this favourable credit while other countries are receiving payment in  old.(iii) T?e should be accepting their bond or --guarantee while they refuse to acknowledge existing bonds,(iv) We should bo going back on the conditions stated in Parliament.(v) V/e should be doing business on terms which would almost certainly be rejected by the ExportOredi 13 A&amp;vi sory C ommi11 e e.If therefore their present proposal in to be accepted, it appears that it cannot bo dealt with simply as an extension of the Export Credits Scheme, but would have to be dealt with as a separate proposal for a special credit.(Intld.) P.I1.G.August, 19?, 1.
