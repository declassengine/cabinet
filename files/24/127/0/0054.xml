The rejection by the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation, on the ballot vote, of the employers&apos; proposals for reducing wages brings all the Printing Trade Unions once more into line. The tendency towards disintegration, however, is to be noticed among miners. A secession from the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, on the part of the colliery craftsmen, is noted below, and a small similar movement among miners was projected in Lanarkshire, but appears to have been dropped. Some perturbation is being displayed by the miners at the recent decisions to withhold unemployment benefit.There are indications that the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, at the annual conference which begins on the 17th August, will be authorised to agree to work Part II of the Mining Industry Act, 1920.Spasmodic, but fairly widespread, wages reductions continue to be reported. Co-operative Societies, particularly, both wholesale and retail, have been active in proposing reductions.With the exception of that involving the shipyard joiners,* no really important dispute is in progress or threatened. The unemployment position, measured by the number on the live registers, shows a continued though slower improvement. The estimated total of the live register of all Employment Exchanges on the 12th August was 1,685,500, as compared with 1,738,300, the estimated number on the 5th August, and with 1,686,900 the corresponding figure for the 15t&apos;h April, at the end of the second week of the recent general coal stoppage.For the first time since the beginning of November, 1920, the index number of retail prices (all items) published in the Labour Gazette shows an increase over that for the previous month. On the 2nd August the average level of retail prices of all commodities taken into account was 122 per cent, above that of July, 1914. The corresponding figure for the, 1st July, 1921, was 119.Government control of the railways, under Section 3 of the Ministry of Trans-port Act, 1919, ceased at midnight on Monday, the 15th August.* while this report -was in the press, a settlement of this dispute was reported, and work is to be resumed on the 22nd august.(34430-31) Wt.74-K5 300 8/21 H St. G 99/8
FEATURES   OF   THE   WEEK.General Topics.Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. Three cases relating to claims for unem-ployment benefit for miners have been dealt with recently. The first, heard on the 28th July, was &quot; An appeal to the Umpire on behalf of Robert Fairhurst, employed in the Manton Colliery of the Wigan Coal and Iron Company (near Sheffield), against a decision of a Court of Referees disqualifying him under Section 8 (1) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, from unemployment benefit in respect of the period from the date of the cessation of the recent dispute until the clearing of the mine workings permitted him to resume work.&quot;It was argued on behalf of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain that &quot; a stoppage of work is only due to a trade dispute if the trade dispute is.....theproximate and immediate cause of the stoppage of work &quot; and not if a new cause, either physical or financial, intervenes.&quot; The decision of the Umpire was as follows : &quot; On the facts before me my decision is that the claim for benefit should be disallowed. The state of dis-repair into which the mines had fallen was a condition which, in this industry, was a natural and almost inevitable accompaniment of a complete stoppage of work. The probable occurrence of this condition in many of the mines, if the stoppage of work was sufficiently complete, must have been expected, therefore, and must have been present to the minds of both parties during the negotiations which took place both before and after the commencement of the stoppage of work.&quot; The continuance of the stoppage of work, owing to the dis-repair of the mines, must be regarded, therefore, in my judgment, as a continuance of the stoppage of work which was due to the trade dispute.&quot;The two other cases were heard at Nottingham by a Court of Referees. One, affecting about 700 men at the Hucknall No. 2 Colliery (Nottingham), was made on the ground that the continued stoppage of work was due to re-organisation of the plant and methods of ventilation rather than to any circumstances arising out of the coal strike. It was contended that, on the 24th May, the workmen were requested by the manager to permit the safety men to go to work, and, after consideration, they were allowed to do so. The men, however, were not -employed in repairing the damage caused by the stoppage, as the manager directed their activities to re-organising the plant.The second claim concerned a section of the men at the Annesley Colliery. Here, also, it was contended that the damage was attributable more to the change of ventilation-tion which had been brought about than to any action of the men, whoy therefore, felt that they were entitled to out-of-work pay.Both claims, which were heard on the 5th August, were disallowed. It was intimated that the workmen concerned at the Hucknall No. 2 Colliery would appeal to the Umpire.Corn Production A cts (Repeal) Bill. Clause 4 of this Bill was further amended in minor respects on report on the 10th August, and was read for a third time and passed, in the House of Lords on the 12th August.The Lords&apos; Amendments were considered on the 15th August, in the House of Commons, where the amendment carried in the other House confining the powers of the conciliation committees to the regulation of wages and hours and ruling out &quot; conditions of employment &quot; was negatived. The phrase &quot; or in respect of a period exceeding six weeks &quot; at the end of sub-section (4) (previously at the end of sub-section 5) was also not agreed to.Expiring Laws Continuance Bill. This Bill received its second reading in the House of Commons on the 12th August, and was considered in Committee on the 15th August. On the 16th August it was considered, as amended, and read a third time.The Bill provides for the continuance of, inter alia, the following Acts : (1) The Shops (Early Closing) Act 1920,* ordering the closing of shops not later than 8 p.m. on every day, other than Saturday, and not later than 9 p.m. on Saturday, except for the sale of meals or refreshments, intoxicating liquors, etc.(2) The Unemployment (Relief Works) Act 1920, &quot; to make better provision for the employment of unemployed persons by facilitating the acquisition of, and entry on, land required for works of public utility, and purposes connected therewith.&quot;(3) The Workmen&apos;s Compensation (War Addition) Act 1917 to provide, as an addition to the amount of compensation payable under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act 1906, in cases of total incapacity, a sum equal to one-fourth of the amount of that payment.The Unemployed Workmen Act (1905) and the Coal Mines (Minimum Wage) Act 1912 are also included in the Bill.* The Home Secretary was requested by a deputation from the Early Closing Association on the 23rd May to make the present hours permanent.   See this Report Vol. Ill, No. 22, 28th May, p. 447.
The Shops (Early Closing) Act (1920) Amendment Bill. This Bill, which pro-vides for &quot; the sale of sweets, chocolates, or other sugar confectionery, or ice cream, until 9.30 p.m. on week, days, other than Saturday, and 10 p.m. on Saturday,&quot; was presented in the House of Commons on the 16th August, and was to be read a second time on the 17th August.Irish Railways (Settlement of Claims) Bill. This Bill was read a second time in the House of Commons, on the 15th August, and was considered in Committee on the 16th August.The Cost of Living. Incidental to a proposed agreement between the National Federated Electrical Association and the Electrical Trades Union to institute a scheme for regulating wages in connection with the Labour Gazette increased prices index number, some doubt was expressed as to the validity of adopting the &quot; cost-of-living &quot; principle as a basis for the establishment of wages. One firm suggested that a more satisfactory method would be for wages to vary inversely to the unem-ployment figure; i.e., as unemployment increases, the wage should decrease. Criticism of the actual Labour Gazette figure has been offered by a branch of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, who think that the Labour Party&apos;s cost-of-living figure should be considered.Industrial and Other Organisations.Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain. The annual conference of the Miners&apos; Federation opens at Llandudno on the 17th August. It will be concerned, mainly, with the question of setting up a National Coal Board, and with the district decisions to work Part II of the Mining Iudustry Act of 1920. At the last annual conference, held at Leamington, it was decided, by a practically unanimous vote, not to take any part in the administration of the Act. It is reported that a majority of the districts have agreed to work Part II of the Act.Mr. Hodges will report on the relations existing between the Federation and the other constituent members of the Triple Alliance, and the miners will be invited to consider future policy in that connection. The relation of the officials to the federation will also come up for discussion.Amongst industrial matters under discussion will be proposals from North-cumberland, Durham and South Wales, dealing with the abolition of piece-work, and from Leicester, Nottingham and Scotland, proposing a maximum working week of five shifts.South Wales Miners and Craftsmen.-A conference of colliery craftsmen was held at Cardiff, on the 11th August, Mr. J. Rowe, president of the craftsmen&apos;s organisation at the time of its abolition, being in the chair. The meeting finally decided to break away from the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, and to reconstruct the South Wales Colliery Enginemen&apos;s and Craftmen&apos;s Association^ Contribu-tions to the new body were fixed at 2s. a month, and a provisional committee was appointed. The association will apparently be in a somewhat difficult position as regards the working of the Mining Industry Act of 1920, as the operation of-that Act ie placed entirely in the hands of the Miners&apos; Federation and of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.There are also other evidences of dissatisfaction with the working of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation. The anthracite district is submitting to the executive drastic proposals for the reorganisation of the federation, and considerable criticism has been concentrated on its financial administration.A meeting of the Blaenavon, Mon., Branch, on the 16th August, resolved that, in the future, they would devote their funds purely to industrial matters. The resolution affiliating the lodge to the Local Labour Party was accordingly rescinded.On the other hand, the proposals of the Executive Committee, which were rejected by the lodges, for a 5 per cent, levy on earnings in aid of unemployed members, have been referred back for reconsideration. Mr. Vernon Hartshorn, M.P., has also contributed a series of articles to the South Wales News, in which he analyses the federation^ expenditure, and refutes the charge of extravagant administration.* See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 6, 6th August, p. 64. 34430 &apos; A 2
Lanarkshire Miners&apos; Union. In Lanarkshire also an attempt has been made to set up a miners&apos; union independent of the Miners&apos; Federation. It was to be called &quot; the Scottish National Trades Union Association,&quot; and was to proceed on constitutional and non-political lines, favouring the abolition of the strike as a means of settling disputes. It has now been agreed, however, that the workers concerned will remain in the Lanarkshire Miners&apos; County Union.Scottish Mining Conference. The annual conference of the National Union of Scottish Mine Workers was held in Edinburgh, on the 12th August. The chairman, Mr. Hugh Murnin, J.P., in his address, referred to the results of the recent dispute, remarking that, although the miners did not get all they started the struggle for, yet they had gained much, particularly the right to know the profits of the coal trade. At the termination of the agreement they would understand the situation better, and it would rest with them to&apos; say whether the proportion of profits to wages was just and equitable. He criticised the reasons for the Governments refusal to subsidise the industry, and the decision to withhold unemployment benefit from those miners who were unemployed, hinting at the possibility of the miners refusing to pay subscriptions.Mr. Smillie, after referring to the recent struggle, urged greater unanimity in the ranks, gently chiding the younger members for their impatience, and made the significant statement that, if there was anything, to be found fault with in the localities, in the counties, or at the centre, it was their duty to see. that their organisa-tion put these things right at the earliest possible moment, so that they would reach their full strength as a fighting arm.Mr. Smillie also entered a strong protest against the refusal of benefit to unem-ployed mineworkers; and,&quot; subsequently, the following resolution, proposed by Mr. W. Adamson, M.P., and seconded by Mr. TJoonan, was passed : &quot; That this conference of the National Union of Scottish Mine Workers, representing the miners of Scotland, hereby strongly protests against the action of the Government in with-holding the benefits of the Unemployment Insurance Act from the miners, urges that this disability be removed at the earliest possible opportunity, and that, with the view of securing this object, we request the British Miners&apos; Federation, the Labour Party, and the Parlia-mentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress to take the necessary steps in order to accomplish that end.&quot;Another resolution was passed protesting against the Governments housing policy.The conference afterwards met in private, and appointed the office-bearers for the current year.Amalgamated Union of Operative Bakers, Confectioners and Allied Workers.  This union held their annual conference at Southport, on the 15th and 16th August. A resolution was passedf&quot;expressing strong disapproval of the Government for not carrying out their promise to abolish night-work; and the Executive Council are to inaugurate a national movement in favour of its abolition. A resolution brought forward by the executive agreeing to the scheme for federation with the Scottish and Irish unions was also approved.National Federation of Fishermen and Fishing Engineers. A union under this name has been formed at Grimsby. It covers the National Union of British Fisher-men ; the National Sailors and Firemen&apos;s Union and the Hull Seamen&apos;s Union. Mr. R. Bingham, the general secretary of the National Union of British Fishermen, has been appointed secretary of the Federation pro tern. The new organisation is said to have been formed with the objects of preventing the dumping of foreign-caught fish, and of promoting a national wages movement.National Sailors and Firemen&apos;s Union. There is a certain amount of discontent amongst members with the administration of this union and with the policy pursued by Mr. Havelock Wilson. A meeting of the Bristol Seamen&apos;s Vigilance Committee (a rank and file organisation within the union) was held, on the 10th August, to discuss the workings of the union, and carried, without dissent, a resolution to the effect that members should refuse to show their union books and should pay no&apos; more subscriptions till their demands were recognised. It is possible that, at the next annual conference, a strong effort to displace Mr. Havelock Wilson from the presi-dency of the union will be made.Foremen&apos;s A ssociations. A good deal of development has recently been taking place in the organisation of foremen. The three constituent bodies of the Federation of Foremen&apos;s Associations the National Foremen&apos;s Association, the Amalgamated Managers&apos; and Foremen&apos;s Association, and the Scottish Foremen&apos;s Association 
* See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 5, 30th July, p. 58. t See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 6, 6th August, p. 65. % See this Report Vol. IV, No. 5, 30th July, p. 57.have opened up negotiations for complete amalgamation. The annual delegate meeting of the National Foremen&apos;s Association have agreed upon the principle, con-ditionally upon the constitution of the association being retained in its essentials, and it is understood that the two other associations concerned take the same view.In addition, a National Confederation of Foremen&apos;s, Managers&apos; and Supervisory-Associations has recently been formed, under the auspices of the Industrial League and Council.   The confederation represents an aggregate membership of 11,950, and -covers the following associations : National Forernen&apos;s Association; River Thames etc. Foremen&apos;s Association; Amalgamated Managers and Foremen&apos;s Association ; National Society of Textile Foremen; Pottery Managers and Officials Association ; Royal Arsenal Association of Foremen and Draughtsmen ; Coventry Foremen&apos;s Association of Engineering and Allied Trades ; Amalgamated Association of Cotton Mill Officials of Lancashire, Cheshire and Yorkshire ; Guild of Calico Printers, Bleachers, Dyers and Finishers&apos; Foremen ; National Federation of Clerks of &quot;Works and Builders&apos; Foremen&apos;s Associations ; National Associations of Supervisory Electricians ; the National Federation of Stationmasters and Agents Associations.The Confederation is anxious that the status of foremen, as a class, should be definitely recognised and admitted in the constitution of Joint Industrial Councils.Of interest, also, is the fact that the Federation of Foremen&apos;s Associations and the Association of Engineering and Shipbuilding Draughtsmen have entered into an agreement for taking joint action in the case of officially recognised disputes.NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES. Demands and Negotiations.Coal Miners (National). The National Wages Board of the coal-mining industry, which was set up in accordance with the terms of the recent settlement^ met in London on the 9th and 10th August. At the first meeting it was agreed that Sir William Plender, G.B.E., who had been nominated by the Lord Chief Justice, should be the independent chairman of the Board. Sir William presided at the second meeting, when the Board proceeded with the consideration of the report, of the accountants on the items of expenditure to be regarded as costs of production for the determination of wages, and for the division of the proceeds of the industry between wages and profits.Shipbuilders (National). It will be remembered that, with regard to the special Board of Arbitration, which has been appointed to hear the claim of the employers for the withdrawal of the &quot; standard ship &quot; cycle of advances, arrangements had been made for the hearing of the Scottish case at Glasgow on the 9th August, t This hearing has now been postponed until the 23rd August, and the Board will sit at Newcastle on the 30th August for the purpose of hearing the English case.A difference between the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the National Union of General Workers and the National Amalgamated Union of Labour has been referred to the Board, with practically the same terms of reference as in the case of the skilled unions.Printing Employees (National). It will be remembered that the London Society, of Compositors had arranged to take a ballot on the question of acceptance or reject-tion of the proposed wages reductions, coupled with that of paying a special levy of 7s. 6d. per week until the wages question should be settled. At a meeting of the society, in London, on the 10th August, the result of the ballot showed a majority of 8,417 against the reductions, 9,506 voting against the reductions, and 1,089 voting in favour.   It is reported in the Daily Herald that the levy was also agreed to.The Joint Industrial Council for the Printing and Allied Trades met at Montagu House, on the 10th August, when it was announced that a ballot of the Printing and Kindred Trades&apos; Federation had gone against the acceptance of the proposals which had been put before the constituent bodies. 1 - After a prolonged session of the Council, it was agreed to recommend all the unions throughout the country to take an immediate ballot on the following terms :-A reduction of 7s. 6d. per -week for fully qualified male workers 5s. to take effect on the pay-day in the week ending the 27th August and a further 2s. 6d. on the pay-day in the week ending the 24th September.
* See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 5, 30th July, p. 57.t See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 6, 6th August, p. 65, and No. 7,13th August, p. 73.A reduction of 3s. per week in the wages of qualified women workers 2s. to take effect on the pay-day in the week ending the 27th August and Is. on the pay-day in the week ending the 24th September.Proportionate reductions in the wages of male and female learners and apprentices.It is expected that the ballot will be completed before the 24th August.Chemical Workers (National). As a result of the employers&apos; proposal to reduce wages by 2d. per hour, a ballot of the workers in the chemical industry has been taken, and shows a large majority against the proposal, the figures being : against acceptance, 10,510; in favour of acceptance, 434; majority against, 10,076. Strike notices, to take effect on the 27th August, have already been issued, but the workers&apos; side have asked for a meeting of the Joint Industrial Council for the industry, and it is probable that such a meeting will be held on or about the 18th August.Some 3,000 salt workers have already ceased work, having taken a separate ballot.Co-operative Employees (Scotland). The directors of the United Co-operative Baking Society, Glasgow, have asked the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers to consent to a 10 per cent, reduction of wages as from the 1st September, this reduction to affect all employees, except bread bakers, to the number of about 1,000.   It is reported that the union will oppose these proposals.Co-operative Wholesale Employees (National). With regard to the proposal of the Co-operative Wholesale Society to reduce the wages of their employees by 10 per cent.,* this reduction is to affect all workers receiving less than  377 per annum, with the exception of those whose rates of pay are regulated by craft conditions, by Trade Boards, and by Industrial Council or other agreements, and the society propose that the reduction shall operate as from the 22nd August. The unions concerned have replied, protesting againsfthe proposal and advising their members to resist. They have, however, requested that an interview be granted in order that the matter may be discussed, and it is understood that the society will receive a deputation on the 17th August.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Painters and. Plumbers (Creive). A strike of 30 painters and plumbers employed on the Gresty Road housing scheme, Crewe, occurred on the 2nd August, owing to the fact that, in the eariy stages of the housing schema, the employers sent their. men from the shops to the scheme and paid them walking time. As the work became more advanced, the employers, it is alleged, without consulting the men, endeavoured to alter the conditions and to grade the men as taken on at the job, thus avoiding the payment of walking time. -The men claim that this alteration of practice is against the agreed rules. The matter is being dealt with by the North-Western Area Joint Council for the Building Industry.Settlements and Agreements.Freestone Quarry Workers. (Yorkshire). The difference of opinion which had occurred as to the interpretation of the sliding scale under Clause 4 of the local agree-meht, t has now been settled. It will be remembered that the matter was referred to the National Joint Council for the Freestone Section of the Quarrying Industry, which met on the 10th August, but no decision was arrived at. The matter was, therefore, again discussed at the meeting of the Yorkshire Area Joint Council, which was held on the 11th August, when an agreement, which is a compromise of the clause, was arrived at, whereby there is to be a further reduction of \d. in the wages of craftsmen on the 16th September. It was also&apos; agreed that the wages of labourers should be reduced 2d. per hour as from the same date.The local agreement is to be cancelled and a fresh one drawn up. The workers&apos; side objected to this course as at the annual meeting of the Area Joint Council it had been agreed that the local agreement should stand for six months from the 26th July, and that either side should give two months&apos; notice of withdrawal. The employers&apos; side, however, insisted, and a new agreement is to be drawn up within three months from the 29th July.Textile Warehouse Workers (London). The National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks and the National Union of Distributive

Marks per man-hour to qualify.Special    .........   75s. 375 and over.First        ..........70s. 300-374.Second     .........   65s. 225-299.Third      .........   60s. 150-224.Fourth    .........   55s. 75-149.Fifth       ......      ...   50s. 30-74.Sixth      .........48s. 1-29.The basic rates will only be reached when the cost-of-living index number is reduced to such an extent as will absorb the whole of the margin between the present wage and the basic rate, e.g., if a man now getting 68s. is in Class 4, the cost of living must fall 65 points before he reaches the basic rate of 55s.Amongst other provisions of the settlement, the grade of assistant signalman is abolished, and all men working in the same cabin will receive the same rate of pay.Co-operative Employees, Retail Societies (Various Districts). It will be remem-bered that certain proposals for reductions in wages have been put forward by the Federation of Co-operative Hours&apos; and Wages&apos; Boards of the North-Western Section of the Co-operative Union to the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers, and that the matter was to be submitted to the Joint Committee of Trade Unionists and Co-operators.J This Committee sat in Manchester on the 16th August to deal with the matter, and, after deliberating in private, decided on the following reduc-tions : for managers, 4s. per week; other men, 4s. to 4s. 6d.; manageresses and other women, 5s.; juniors, Is. to 5s.Packing Case Makers (Sheffield). An agreement has been reached between the Sheffield and District Packing Case Makers&apos; Association and their workers, whereby on and from the 2nd August wages are to be reduced by 7s. per week in the case of* See this Report, VolrlV, No. 5, 30th July, p. 57.t See this Report Vol. II, No. 25, 18th December, 1920, p. 683.t See this Report Vol. IV, No. 5, 30th July, p. 57.and Allied Workers have now agreed to the wages proposals of the Wholesale Textile Association^ It will be remembered that a joint meeting of the two unions and the association was held on the 22nd July, when modified proposals were put forward by the association for consideration. The unions were, apparently, prepared to adopt these proposals, provided that a grading scheme that was included therein was omitted, but, instead of applying for this concession, they presented counter proposals which were unanimously rejected at a meeting of the association, on the 27th July. On that date the association put further amended proposals before the unions, and while the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers stated that they were prepared to accept the proposals, the shop assistants&apos; union suggested that the ques-tion be referred to arbitration. The association refused to adopt this course, and, after consultation with the Chief Conciliation Officer, London, the union decided to accept the proposals.Railway Shopmen (National). With regard to the recent settlement concerning the wages and working conditions of skilled craftsmen employed in railway engineer-ing shops, referred to in last week&apos;s issue of this Report, it will be remembered that it was stated that the policy of the Amalgamated Engineering Union is to negotiate directly and independently with the railway companies, and that negotiations with the Great Central Railway Company were understood to be complete. It has now been agreed, at a conference held between this railway company, the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation, to adopt the national engineering trades settlement of December, 1920, t with regard to overtime and night-shift conditions. The agreement is to take effect as from 15th July, and will apply to the ordinary running and repair sheds.   -Railway Signalmen (National). A special delegate meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen, held in London on the 11th August, decided to accept the offer of the railway companies in regard to the wages and conditions of signalmen. Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P., issued an official statement made at the close of the meeting, from which it appeared that, although the General Secretary had been empowered to ratify the agreement, the meeting expressed profound disappointment with the proposals &quot; as not being commensurate with the responsibilities and duties of so important a grade in the railway service.&quot;The agreement embodies a new grading system, based on marks allotted for the movements of levers and gates and other operations. The classification of boxes pro-vides for the following grades and basic wages:

During the week ending the 5th August, the Appointments Department placed 214 candidates, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 57,993. Of these, 7,424 have been placed through the agency of the departments Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 649 ex-Service men and 14 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 5th August was 12,099 ex-Service men and 1,378 civilians. At the same date, 713 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 273 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men. Owing to the incidence of the holiday period, the statistics of men in training will not appear during August.* See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 2, 9th July, pp. 27 and 28.Printed by His Majbsty&apos;s Stationery Office Pbess, .U-17, Hare Street, E.2.men, 4s. in the case of youths between 18 and 21, and 2s. per week in the, case of boys under 18. After the reduction has taken place, the hourly rate for men of 21 years of age and over is to be Is. 7%d., and the normal number of working hours for the week is to be 47.Metropolitan Water Board Employees. An award of the Industrial Court, dated the 5th August, has been made, fixing the bonus of adult male employees of the Metropolitan Water Board at 41s. \\d. per week, as from the beginning of the first pay period following the 5th August, and deciding that the bonus shall vary in future with the official cost-of-living index number, in accordance with the scheme recom-mended by the National Joint Industrial Council for the Waterworks Undertakings Industry. *The difference between the Board and their employees arose out of the clashing of a scheme already adopted by the Board and that adopted by the Council.,Two questions of general interest were raised by this case : first, whether a repre-sentative of any section not being present at a meeting of the Council, the recommenda-tions of the Council should be held to apply to that section. The Court decided that there were strong reasons why a recommendation of the Council should be observed by all those who are represented on the Council, even if the representative was not present at the meeting at which the recommendation was discussed.
