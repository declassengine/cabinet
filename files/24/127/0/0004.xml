Monday. &apos;     Lord.Privy Seal to prime Minister. 8th Aug.19S1. This morning I got&apos;together Worthlngton Evans, chief secretary iand Attorney General to oonsicer MoKeown&apos;s oase.     lord Chancellor.was not. available. We all feel objection to reversing Cabinet decision and difficulty in disagreeing-with Viceroy.    But we note that Macready and Tudor raise no objection On ground of diecinline or. safety, if release, is thought politically.desirable.- This cuts away Chief: Seeretary*s only original ground for refusing release and he and Attorney  enezgl are clearly of opinion that release should he grantee-v    Attorney General observing- that,.we have swallowed camel of negotiations with instigators and procurers and must not wreck settlement by straining; at gnat of one more release.      Worthington Evans.concurs. In release provided you are satjsfiod that you can stanA,at this point and will not be blackmailed into &quot;filrther surrender especially, as regards internee8.    At this point when I was about to express my view a further-message&apos;-seat in following telegram was received from. Macready and this is decisive for all of us.    We recommend release.     If. you a or rove please let me know and allow announcement to be made here.
General Macready .to Chief Secretary.I. gather that case of. McKebwn. is or e at j. rig a stir in Sinn Fein extreme&apos; circles here. .,T7hile&apos; recognising the difficult position in which Government is placed I con-sider&apos; that if negotiations &quot;break down, on account of McKeown public opinion would not consider that the case was of sufficient -importance to warrant the-breakdown and if so the country- would not be wholly behind Govern-ment if hostilities recommence.   McKeown is looked on as a kind of hero by the extremist and I.R.a. and his crime cannot be compared to that of the massacres   of officers last November for which&apos;Collins.is responsible or murder-of Mrs. Lindsay for which Burgess is responsi-ble.   Valera being directly responsible, for both. .&apos; These men will attend the Dail and my personal opinion is that if Government can recede with dignity; from posi-tion taken up and release McKeown it would be well to do so.   His release would have&apos; no special military significance.   If hostilities do recommence we must be in a position in.which the &quot;onus must be entirely on Sinn Fein,     ..&apos;&quot;::\&apos;.&apos; &apos;  IV. &apos;In reply to II and III the Prime Minister.telephoned approving the immediate release of McKeown and the Chief Secretary sent.the necessary instructions to Ireland together with a&apos;full explanation to the Viceroy.
