REPORT OP THE INT3R-AU.IZD MILITARYCRST,COMMISSION OF VERSAILLES Og THE AIR QIICTION^.. PART   I,POSITION OF THff WORK ACCOMPLISHED BY THE I.A.A.C.Q.,The position is that all the known aeronautical material is now in the hands of the Relchstreuhandgesellschaft, i,e, the organ charged by the German Government with carrying out the delivery or destruction of this material.   Ho questions of principle are at present outstanding with the German Govern-merit, and the work of delivery and destruction is proceeding normally under the supervision of the Control Officers.   This supervision continues to be necessary, as even under super-vision a certain quantity of material is constantly disappear-ing.   In addition to the known material, email quantities of undeclared material continue to come to light either as the result of legal measures taken by the German Government, or as the result of information which reaches the commission of Control,This undeclared material when found has to be dis-posed of.The material to be dealt with by the aeronautical Com-mission may be divided into two principal categories:-(A) Aircraft and Acoessories,(B) Installations, such as sheds and Hydrogen Plants(A) may further be divided as referred to above into (i) known material and (ii) undeclared material.As regards A (i) the work is very nearly completed, and is expected to be entirely finished by the beginning of next month, with the exception of aeronautical armament, the final disposal of which may take somewhat longer.As/
As regards A til) this is an nintoaowii. factor .,-XII that can be said is that in many oases tho total amount of material surrendered by the German Government does not agree with what was oxpooted to be found, -Tho latest German law on the subject has f iajd August 15th as the date by which, under severe penalties, all material hold back must be surrendered.   This is tho third law of ttie kind, and when this has expired, all legal methods to bring out this&apos;material will have been exhausted.The Oommission by its own methods is only finding negligible quantities of material.It may therefore be said thatalso in September 1921 everything possible will have been done in this respect.Lastly as regards (B) the work of demolishing the large and numerous installations in Germany has taken longer than was anticipated, and though the work Is well advanced, supervision is still necessary to ensure that the demolitions are throughly carried out, aad that the installations are not left in   such a state that their reconstruction is facilitated. This supervision must continue for some considerable time, depending on the degree of thoroughness In clearing up required to be attained..The position   of the work accomplished by the I.AJLCC, is therefore considered to be as follows?-&quot;The Military Air Power of Germany has been broken, but the resulting debris has not yet been finally disposed of, and if left In Its present stage might render it easier for Germany to rebuild a certain power in the air from the remaining fragments&quot;.

155PART   II.THS , &apos;70RX, R3HiIMG TO   BS   AflOffl..L.ISHBD   BY , THS   I.A.A.C.C.It results from tho above that the principal work remaining to be accomplished by the I.A.A.C.G. is to see that the work started is carried through to Its definite conclusion. In addition to this, however, there is triie disposal of the material constructed contrary to the detision of Boulogne, which has hardly commenced and also decisions to be taken as regards the aeronautical material in Softie.swig and Danzig.It is anticipated that If aothing arises to retard the elocution of the Treaty, by the latter half of September, this work will be sufficiently advanced for the Commission to report that for practical purposes the aerial clauses may be considered as executed so far as Is possible with the means at the disposal of the Commission.     If this report is accepted, the date will be determined from which the three months commences to run until the expiration of which Germany is not allowed to re-commence the construction of civil aricraft. This period of three months, would it is considered, be required for the actual final   clearing up of all outstanding matters by a*reduced section of the Commission, Included in these matters is the completion of the Commissions report on its work.Under these circumstances it is proposed that:-(1) The Inter-Allied. Aeronautical Commission of Control will be reduced on the 30th of September to 15 officers, (2) The Inter-Allied Aeronautical Commission of Control  will finish    the work and leave Germany on the 31st December, 1921^ and that the embargo on the construction of German airci*aft will be withdrawn from this date...(a)
(3) At the end of this period-, l*.e* &quot;the- 31s-, -december, 1921, the Commission will.hand over to a ^ody or an&apos;organisation charged with carrying out In the future the supervision of the manner in which the German Government carries out Article 19B.xTaken generally, the different d&amp;tes given above are provisional and dependent on the work progressing as is at present anticipated.Whatever dates shall &quot;be decided upon, these should not he communicated to the Gorman Government, as a communication of this kind would have the inevitable result of delaying the work.5.
PART i III,PROPOSALS   &apos;?ITH   REGARD   TO   TEE   jPORM   OF    SUPERVISION WHICH WILL ASSURE IK   THE   FUTURE   THE.&apos; EXECUTION    OF THE   AIR   CLAUSES   OF   THE   TREATY    Oi?   VERSAILLES.The principle of the necessity for some supervision which will   guarantee the continuation of the execution of the Treaty of Versailles has been admitted by the Supreme Council (Resolution of 29th January, 1921, and confirmed toy the Ultimatum of the 5th May, 1921m and accepted by the German Government).As regards the form which this supervision should take, the French and Belgian Representatives proposed:A Commission of Supervision composed of a limited number of Allied officers of each of the Powers represented pn the Commission of Control, with Headquarters at Berlin   and expenses paid by these Powers.    This Commission would take over She powers of the Commission now functioning, the replacement shall not involve a hiatus.The British   Air Representative put forward the following opinion:&quot;The British Air Representative is prepared to accept the following -organisation which would come into being after the present I.A.A.G.C. has been withdrawn in its entirety i.e. after the completion of the execution of the Air Glauses of the Treaty:-An Aeronautical Commission comprising echelons of officers of those Allied nationalities now represented on the I.A.A.C.C,   These officers would normally be employed In   their own countries in their ordinary work.   Only when tho AlliedGovernments
158  1Governments themselves, acting upon the advice of some joint body such as the C.M,A.V. to  which would be added Air Representatives, received reports of suspicious German aeronautical activity would this Commission be ordered to assemble to investigate and to report.     This Commission, unlike the present I.A.A.CO, would have to be paid by the Allied Governments.The organisation proposed above is not covered by the Treaty and is in temporary substitution for investigation by the Council of the League of Nations contemplated under Article 213,,The British Air Representative Is ready to accept definitions 8 and 9 subject to the proviso that such accept-ance will not involve any control other than such as is consistent with the form of control described above&quot;.The Italian and Japanese representatives considered that in view of the political nature of the decision to be taken they could not put forward an opinion as to where the Headquarters of the Committee of Supervision should be.This question a3 to where the Headquarters should be is now the only point on which there is a difference of opinion, unanimity having been reached as regards all other points.,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. 16th August, 1921,
