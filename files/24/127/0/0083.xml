A settle-ment of the chemical Workers&apos; dispute was satisfactorily effected, but the printing trades, with the rejection of the employers&apos; new proposals by most of the skilled unions, have again become a centre of disturbance.The settlement of the question of shopmen&apos;s wages between the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Railway Companies has cleared the way for a trial of strength - between this Union and the National Union of Railwaymen at the Trades Union Congress next week.The principal Recommendations of the International Emigration Commission are summarised below.&apos; The unemployment position continues to improve slowly. The estimated total of the live register of all Employment Exchanges on 26th August was 1,575,800 as compared with 1,640,600/ the estimated number on 19th August.The &quot; Cost of Living Index Number Controversy&quot; has been attracting some attention in the press during the week. The statistical methods of the Joint Labour Committee continue to receive criticism, and the desirability of a new &quot; Budget Enquiry &quot; is referred to.(34548-3X) Wt.74-E8 300 9/21 H.

FEATURES   OF   THE   WEEK.General Topics.Corn Production Acts (Repeal) Act. Protests against the abolition of the Agricul-tural Wages Boards are being organised in all parts of the country by the Workers&apos; Union. The Union is reported to be particularly active&apos;in Cheshire.At a meeting of the Monmouthshire Chamber of Agriculture, a resolution was passed declaring that conciliation boards were unnecessary, the members being strongly of opinion that farmers and their workmen are competent to decide between themselves as to wages and working conditions, and that any arrangement.which settles a rate of wage irrespective of the value of the service rendered would cause dissatisfaction and unemployment.International Emigration Commission. The resolutions of the International Emigra-tion Commission, appointed in accordance with a recommendation of the International Labour Conference at Washington, which sat at the International Labour Office, Geneva, from the 2nd to the 11th August are now available. The task of the Commission was to &quot; consider and report what measures can be adopted to regulate the migration of workers out of their native country and to protect the interests of wage earners residing in another country than their own.&quot;Among the resolutions adopted by the Commission were the following : &quot; Each Member should undertake to place at the disposal of emigrants the services of its public employment exchange system, in addition to the special services which may exist, for the purpose of assisting them in securing employment.&quot;(a) &quot; It is desirable that in default of legislative measures already existing in the various countries, the Members of the International Labour Organisation should take steps to bring about, as far as possible by means of international conventions, equality of treatment between immigrant workers and their dependents and their own nationals, particularly in respect both of labour and social insurance legislation, and of relief, and of the right of association for trade union purposes.&quot;(6) &quot; The International Labour Office is requested to prepare a report for submission to a future Conference with a view to bringing about as far as possible uniformity of legislation in respect of social insurance, either between all countries or between certain groups of countries.&quot;&quot; Every Member should make provision for the effective examination of emigrants in every port where emigrants embark, and eventually at the chief points on the frontier through which emigrants pass.&quot;&quot; It is necessary to prohibit all illicit propaganda concerning emigration, immigration, and repatriation.&quot;&quot; The International Emigration Commission having been informed of the request of the Delegate of the Chinese Government, and recognizing the connection existing between the question raised by him and that of emigration dealt with by the Commission, adopts the following resolution : The International Emigration Commission proposes that&apos;the International Labour Conference should include as an item on the Agenda equality of treatment from the economic point of view, without distinction of country of origin, for all immigrants legally admitted in the country of immigration.&quot;Other resolutions were adopted proposing(i) The appointment of a Committee of Experts to assist the International Labour Office in the preparation and presentation of a report to the International Labour Conference of 1922 concerning general rules to secure to all emigrants a minimum of security, comfort, etc. while travelling in ships and railways.(2) The creation of a Commission composed of a small number of members and aided if necessary by experts, to assist the Office in its work and to follow the developments of the question of emigration.The recommendations of the Commission will be presented to the General Conference of Representatives of the Members of the International Labour Organisation to be held in 1922.Colonial Emigration. In view of the attention which for various reasons has been devoted in this country to the possibilities of emigration, the attitude of labour in the colonies on this subject is of interest. The Dominion Trades and Labour Congress, Canada, is reported to have recently adopted a resolution in favour of the permanent exclusion of &quot;oriental&quot; immigrants, with the suggestion that for two years no immigrants except agricultural woi&apos;kers should be admitted from European countries.
3454sa 2Unemployment Insurance Act. A test case on behalf of: 400 workmen at Prestongrange Colliery (Scotland) who were thrown out of employment, following the recent dispute, by the action of the colliery management in dispensing with the double shift, has been decided by a Court of Referees in favour of the men. Unless an appeal is made to the National Umpire, unemployment insurance benefit will be paid to the workmen, as from the date of the general resumption of colliery work throughout the country.A similar decision, affecting about the same number of miners, has been given in the case of the workmen at New Delaval Colliery who were unable to be re-employed after the coal stoppage.Trade Boards. At a meeting on the 15th August of the Administrative Committee&apos; of the Boot and Shoe Repairing Trade Board, resolutions were passed expressing the appreciation by the Employers&apos; and Workers&apos; sections of the services of the Appointed Members, and stating that &quot; the Committee view with great regret the organized attempt now being made to cast discredit on the Trade Board system.&quot;Trade Union Education Enquiry Committee. The Trade Union Congress will have before it a scheme for a great trade unionist educational movement submitted in a Report by the Trade Union Education Enquiry Committee. The Report gives a survey of the educational needs of the trade union and co-operative movements, and makes certain recommendations that have already been endorsed by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress. It advocates an extension of the activities of the Workers&apos; Educational Trade Union Committee, a body set up by the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation and the Workers&apos; Educational Association jointly.*The need for adequate control by Trade Uiiions both of their own expenditure on education and of the kind of education provided for their members is emphasized, and the suggestion is made that the Parliamentary Committee be requested to make representation to the Board of Education as to the importance of giving effect to the recommendations of the Committee on Adult Education, and the necessity for the establishment of an Adult Education Fund.The Guild Movement. A Scottish Regional Council of the Building Guild has now been instituted with Mr. John Winning as Chairman and Mr. M. Mackenzie as Secretary. The Council will co-ordinate the work of the various local guilds, of which the Glasgow Guild is the most important. In reviewing the work of all building guilds, Mr. S. G. Hobsqn, secretary of the National Building Guild, stated that they already had contracts amounting to several millions of pounds, and had completed and been paid for work to the value of  500,000.Mr. Hobson is also interesting himself in the establishment of a Furniture and Furnishing Guild. The Guild is expected to start in the course of a few weeks and will at first be confined to Manchester. It is hoped, however, that this is merely preliminary to the formation of a National Guild, which will eventually make furniture for all the workers of the country.International Co-operative Alliance. A congress of the international Co-operative Alliance, the first to be held since 1913, was opened at Basle on the 22nd August. About 400 delegates, representing 27 countries, were present. Of these 80 came from the United Kingdom, 60 from Germany, and 48 from France.The chief problem dealt with was that of the organization of wholesale international trading on co-operative lines, though the Congress recognized that at the present time the abnormal condition of the exchanges made any development in this direction extraordinarily difficult. A resolution was carried recommending that steps should be taken at once &quot; to assist each country to utilise all its available resources to build up an export trade through co-operative channels, by encouraging the purchase of goods through the co-operative movement of each country, and by helping to organize the marketing of the goods so exported.&quot; The same resolution advocated the removal of all Government or other obstacles to international co-operative trading, and urged that all schemes for the promotion of trade by means of credits or otherwise should be on lines suitable to the circumstances of the co-operative movement and should be used by it to the utmost. Another resolution was carried authorising a special conference of Co-operative Banks to formulate a scheme for an international Co-operative Bank.* This organisation consists of a Central Committee and seven divisional committees on which the Confederation has the majority representation. Most progress has been made in Scotland and South Wales.
* See this Eeport Vol. IV, No. 6, 6th August, p. 64. t See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 8, 20th. August, p. 80.A feature of the Congress was the strong &quot; nationalist&quot; attitude of the French delegates who recommended both the exclusion of the Russian delegates from the Congress and the adoption of a resolution on international commercial policy which incidentally virtually endorsed the policy of customs duties and commercial treaties. The former proposal was rejected, and the latter amended by the omission of the part referred to before it received the assent of the Congress.Unemployment. A body of unemployed men belonging to Islington assembled on the evening of August 26th and marched to the workhouse, Upper Holloway, where they demanded an interview with the Board of G uardians. A deputation of eight was admitted and the men&apos;s demands for &quot; adequate out-door relief&quot; were considered. After a discussion, a resolution was passed that the Board should adopt the same scale as that paid by the Camberwell Board of Guardians, which is 12s. 6d. per married man, 12s. 6d. for a wife, and 5s. for each child, together with the amount of the rent and 1 cwt. of coal per week or the equivalent in money. Single men are to receive sBl each. These payments are to be made irrespective of what is received in the form of unemployment benefit. It is reported that the example of Camberwell and Islington will be followed in Shoreditch where the unemployed have announced their intention of waiting upon the Guardians on 31st August to demand enhanced relief.At a meeting of the Parliamentary Committee of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, a resolution was adopted calling upon the Government to extend the period of benefit under the Insurance Act in view of the present extent of unemployment.Cost of Living. The *&apos; Manchester Guardian Commercial &quot; for 25th August contains an important article upon &quot; The Cost of Living Index Number Controversy,&quot; in the course of which the scope, method of compilation, and uses of the official figure are examined, and the statistical methods adopted in the Joint Labour Committee&apos;s Report are subjected to severe criticism. The article proceeds &quot; It may well be, however, that a new figure, based on post-war changes in the standard of living, may soon become desirable, since as time goes on the tendency to refer everything to a comparison with pre-war conditions will weaken. Meanwhile, as a rough criterion on which to base minimum Avages, the Ministry of Labour index number is on the whole the most equitable method yet devised.&quot; This it says without &quot; any desire to oppose the ambitions of labour to secure for itself a better standard of living.&quot;It is reported in the &quot; Manchester Guardian &quot; of 31st August, that the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers has sent out a questionnaire to its branches asking for up-to-date budgets of expenditure, with, if possible, comparisons at last December and July, 1914. The questionnaire asks for details of grocery bills, rent and rates, meat, greengrocery, milk, fish, clothes, boot repairs, and coal. Some difficulty is apparently already, being experienced in obtaining exact comparisons for the three dates. It is stated that such figures as have already been gathered &quot; give more support to the figures of the Joint Labour Committee than to the figures of the Ministry of Labour, though, taken individually, some of them may be regarded as confirmatory of the Ministry&apos;s figures.&quot;Industrial Organisations..Fishermen&apos;&apos;s Organisations. The Hull Seamen&apos;s Union is engaged in taking a ballot of its members on the question of amalgamating with the National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union. Its executive has also decided to give the necessary three months&apos; notice of with-drawal from the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation. It will be remembered that the National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union gave similar notice ,of secession a few weeks ago.*The Gritnsby Steam Fishing Vessels Enginemen and Firemen&apos;s Union, and the Humber Amalgamated Steam Trawlers Engineers and Firemen&apos;s Union, have decided not to join the contemplated National Federation of Fishermen and Fishing Engineers.^- On the other hand, the National Sailors&apos;and Firemeifs Union has only agreed to the represent-ation of the Milford Haven Amalgamated Fishermen&apos;s Union on the Milford Haven Conciliation Board on condition that the latter union becomes affiliated to the Federation.Railway Shopmen. The fourth Annual Conference of the N.U.R. shopmen members was held at Cardiff on 27th and 28th August. Mr. W. Dobbie (York) presided, and in dealing with the Report on the year&apos;s work said that the active antagonism of the
See this Report, Vol. III. No. I.   1st January, 1921.   p. 8.Amalgamated Engineering Union has resulted in very little being done to improve shop workers conditions. A resolution from South Wales opposed the acceptance of the Report and called upon the Shopworkers&apos; Council to form a Union of its own, alleging apathy on the part of the general executive, but was defeated.&apos;Among the remaining resolutions carried were the following : (i) that a uniform system of line committees should be set up ; the committees to be recognized as temporary expedients until the railways were completely nationalised ; (ii) that demarcation com-mittees to define the limitations of the various crafts employed in railway shops should be formed ; (iii) that separate negotiations on behalf of shopworkers between the A.E.U. and the Railway Companies should not be tolerated, nor should any agreement arrived at by such means be recognized.Clyde Trust Association. The Clyde Navigation Trust is endeavouring to induce its employees to set up a trade union of their own and to give up membership of the Dockers&apos; Union. The Trust takes the view that it does not wish its men to lay down their tools in disputes in which they themselves are not involved. A draft constitution for a separate association has accordingly been drawn up by a provisional Committee and submitted to a meeting of the employees. It provides for the setting up of a Conciliation Committee consisting of seven representatives from the Trustees with an equal number from the Association. There is also a clause providing for the automatic reference to arbitration of differences not settled by the Conciliation Committee. As the scheme, however, seeks to eliminate any unions other than craft unions not confined to employees of the Trust, the Scottish Union of Dock Labourers have threatened to refuse to negotiate with any organisation on which the Clyde Navigation Trustees are represented until such time as an assurance is given that employees will not be coerced into joining the new Union.Municipal employees  Association. The Annual Conference of the Municipal Employees&apos; Association was held at the Holborn Restaurant on the 29th and 30th August under the presidency of Councillor W. H. Girling. In his opening address he said that the Provincial and Regional Joint Industrial Councils established in all the principal sections of municipal employment were working very well until the general cry was raised for retrenchment and cheap labour. Since then many Councils had refused to carry out the agreements entered into, and several important municipalities had ceased their connection with Industrial Councils.In this connection a resolution was carried to the effect that the utility and future existence of Industrial Councils depended on the whole-hearted co-operation of employers and employed and the honourable observance by both jDarties of the decisions arrived at. Other resolutions carried condemned the present basis of local rating, advocating its replacement by a graduated income tax levied for local purposes ; and urged the inclusion within the scope of the Unemployment-Insurance Act (1920) of domestic servants temporarily employed by the Poor Law Authorities. Further resolutions dealt with Old Age Pensions and Superannuation.A report on the negotiations for the complete amalgamation with the Workers&apos; Union, the National Union of General Workers and the National Amalgamated Union of Labour was submitted. A basis has been reached and only requires the consent of the members of the respective organisations who will be asked to ballot. The new body, if formed, will probably be called the National Amalgamated Workers&apos; Union, and will have a membership of approximately 1,500,000. A proposal to transfer affiliation from the Amsterdam International Federation of Trade Unions to the Red Trade Union International at Moscow was ruled out of order.NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Shipyard Workers (National). The conference between the Shipbuilding Em-ployers&apos; Federation and the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades referred to in last week&apos;s Report is now definitely fixed for 23rd September. It will be held at the Central Hall, Westminster.Tin Plate Operatives (South Wales). The operation of the sliding scale adopted last January,* by which the bonus above base rates varies with the market price of steel tin bar, is giving rise to much dissatisfaction in the Swansea area. The fall in tin bar prices has reduced the bonus from 13of per cent, (lower percentages in the cases of
* Sec Vol. IV., No. 8.   20th August,   p. 81.certain higher base rates) in January to 85 per cent, in May and 45 per cent, in August. Even this fall has not brought any marked revival in the tin plate trade, and less than 40 per cent, of the works are at pi&apos;esent operating. The workers have discussed their position at various conferences, and are requesting the employers to convene an early meeting of the Joint Industrial Council, at which the possibility of a new arrangement, relating the percentage bonuses more nearly to the cost of living, may be considered:Printers (National). The main results of the printers&apos; ballot on the terms referred to in this Report* (Vol. IV, No. 8, pages 81-2) as amended by the Master Printers, are now available. Acceptances have been notified by the National Union of Printing and Paper Workers, the Lithographic Artists, and the Society of Women Bookbinders, etc. The offer has been rejected by the Typographical Association, the Scottish Typographical Association, the Electrotypers and Stereotypers, and the London Society of Compositors. The National Society of Operative Printers and Assistants, and the Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Printers have not yet announced their results. It will be observed that practically all the skilled unions have rejected the terms.In the case of unions that have accepted the offer, the first reduction of 5s. per week is being applied at once. As regards the unions that have definitely rejected the terms, the Master Printers&apos; Federation has advised its members to post notices on 1st September intimating that the total reduction of 7s. 6d. will be made in the week end in g 24th September.Railwaymen (Ireland). The Railway Arbitration Tribunal which is to decide the questions of standardisation and the eight-hour day on Irish railways continued its sittings during the week. As a result of a short strike of engine drivers, firemen and cleaners on the Great Northern Company of Ireland&apos;s system, this Company is now reported to have agreed to accept the decision of the Tribunal. The strike, which began in Belfast at midnight on the 29th inst., and extended to Dublin early the following morning, followed a notice by the Company of its intention to increase the daily hours of certain classes of employees from eight to ten.   The notice was withdrawn.A short strike occurred on the Dublin and South Eastern Railway on the 29th August, owing to the resentment of the Company&apos;s drivers, firemen and cleaners at certain statements made by an official of the Company a few days before at the meeting of the Arbitration Tribunal. The action of the men was condemned by the Tribunal and by Mr. J. H. Thomas and the men resumed work on the same day.Between 50 and 60 cleaners employed at the Cork terminus of the Great Southern and Western Railway have ceased work as a protest against an alleged reduction in wages of 6s. per week being made before a decision has been reached by the Arbitration Tribunal. Coalmen, steam raisers and cleaners on the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway are also reported to be on strike as a result of wage reductions.Hatters (Lancashire). A provisional agreement has been arranged between the British Felt Hat Manufacturers&apos; Federation and the various unions catering for workers engaged in the felt hat industry, whereby the existing rate of bonus of 100 per cent, over pre-war rates, plus departmental advance, will be reduced to 85 per cent., beginning on the first pay-day in September with a further reduction to 70 per cent, beginning the first pay-day in November.The employers have agreed that, in the event of the cost of living falling to the level of 1914, the wages of the workers will not be reduced below 25 per cent, above that level. It has also been agreed to set up a Committee of employers and representatives of the workers, with a view to formulating a scheme whereby wages may be regulated in accordance with the cost of living index number.Against the advice of the Union officials the Avorkpeople have rejected the agreement, but in order to give the officials more time to explain the settlement to their members, the employers have intimated their readiness to post date the first reduction for one week.Strikes and Lockouts.Building Trade Operatives (Lincolnshire). Work on&apos; the Scunthorpe Housing Scheme, Lincolnshire, has been brought to a standstill as a result of a strike of bricklayers. It appears that the contractors (Tarrants, Ltd., of Byfleet) endeavoured to speed up the work by introducing a system of bonus upon output, over and above the usual wages paid at the hourly rates.   The total wages earned, it is stated, amounted to an average of
2s. 6d. per hour, or od. per hour more than the local trade union rate. The men were said to be quite agreeable to this arrangement, but the officials of the Bricklayers&apos; Union, holding that the men were engaged on piece-work, ordered them to strike.Salt-workers (National). A conference between salt manufacturers and representatives of the workers took place at Crewe &apos;on the 29th instant. The employers suggested a reduction of ljd. per hour, with a further reduction in October of ^d. per hour, these terms having been accepted by the chemical workers earlier in the week (see &quot;Settlements and Agreements&quot; section of this Report).The workers&apos; representatives have agreed to submit the offer to their members.Settlements and Agreements.Shale Oil Workers (Scotland). The continued unemployment in the Scottish shale oil industry only four out of fourteen establishments of Scottish Oils, Ltd., have been operating recently led to a suggestion by the workers&apos; representatives for a further general modification of wages in the industry.*At a conference on the 18th August between Scottish Oils, Ltd., the Scottish Shale Miners&apos; Association and the Scottish Oil Workers&apos; Association a flat rate reduction of approximately 3s. 2d. a day was provisionally agreed to and subsequently accepted by the workpeople on a ballot. This reduction it is expected will permit the reopening of a number of works sufficient to give employment to from 60 per cent, to 70 per cent, of the normal number of workers.Shipyard Joiners (Liverpool). The Liverpool employers have definitely decided to follow the terms of the National Settlement mentioned in last week&apos;s issue of this Report, and yards were accordingly thrown open to the Joiners on the 22nd instant. It has been decided on the Mersey that the line of demarcation between the joiners and shipwrights should remain as it was prior to the strike, and that all shipwrights at present engaged on joiners&apos; work should be replaced forthwith by joiners.Railway Shopmen (National). The Amalgamated Engineering Union gave instruc-tions that their members were not to accept the reduction in wages agreed between the Negotiating Committee of General Managers and the various Unions at the conference on 9th August which the&apos; Amalgamated Engineering Union declined to attend.f A stoppage, threatened to take place on 27th August, was averted&quot; by the Negotiating Committee agreeing to meet the Amalgamated Engineering Union on the 29th August, Avhen the following agreement was arrived at: (a) It is agreed that a joint recommendation be made that the wages of all shop and shed workers be reduced by 6s. per week from 5th August 1921.(&amp;) Arrangements to be made forthwith between the representatives of the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the railway companies to discuss any outstanding rates of wages and conditions of service.Chemical Workers (National).% Following upon the intervention of the Ministry of Labour, the threatened strike of approximately 30,000 operatives in this industry has been averted, and the notices have been withdrawn. The terms of settlement provide for a reduction of l^d. per hour in wages from 1st August, and a further reduction of ^d. per hour from 1 st October. The settlement also provides for the stabilisation of wages until the end of the year.The position as regards salt workers is dealt with in the &quot; Strikes and Lock-outs &quot; section of this Report. .-Co-operative Employees (Northern Section). It will be remembered that the dispute, over a threatened wage reduction, involving employees of retail co-operative societies attached to the Northern Section of the Co-operative Union was referred to arbitration. ** The case was heard in Newcastle on the 18th instant, before Sir William Mackenzie, K.C.The court decided that reductions should be made as follows, one half to operate as from 4th July, I 921, and the whole of the reductions to operate as from 5th September, 1921 : For Adult Males, 7s. per week ; Adult Females, 5s. ; Juniors, 18 to 20 years of age, 3s. 6d. ; Juniors under 18 years, 2s. Productive workers on piece or time-rates, a reduction of 8-^ per cent. (Id. in Is.) on the rates payable prior to the agreement of 2nd November, 1920, leaving 4-^ per cent. (^d. in Is.) still payable on such rates.f See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 7, 12th February, page 156, and No. 10, 5th March, 1921, page 225. 1 See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 7, 13th August, p. 74. * See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 8, 20th August, p. 82. ** See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 7, 13th August, p. 74.

During the week ending the 19th August, the Appointments Department placed 210 candidates, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 58,443. Of these, 7,477 have been placed through the agency of the departments Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 612 ex-Service men and 20 civilians. The number oi candidates available for appointments on the 19th August was 12,745. ex-Service men and 1,397 civilians. At the same date, 649 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 272 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men. Owing to the incidence of the holiday period, the statistics of men in training will not appear during August.Printed by His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office Press, il-17, Hare Street, E.2.The reductions referred to this decision are to take fall effect only in the case of those societies that granted in full the advances provided by the agreement of 2nd November, 1920. In cases where the advances were not granted in full the reductions are, without prejudice to any agreement already made in such cases, to bear the same proportion to the full reduction as the advances granted bore to the full advance.Bricklayers in Gas Works (glasgow District). The Industrial Court, on the 22nd August, issued their decision.upon a difference between the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers and the Federation of Gas Employers (Scotland). The difference arose out of a claim by the workpeople that bricklayers empl oyed in gas undertakings in the Glasgow District, as defined by the workpeople, should be paid the rate of wages agreed upon between the Scottish Steel Makers&apos; Wages Board and the Glasgow District Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society. The rate claimed had already been conceded by the Glasgow Corporation in respect of their gas department, the most important single under-taking in the district. The Court decided against the claim, as they were not satisfied that the nature of the work, and the other circumstances which affect wages, in gas under-takings were sufficiently analogous to those in the steel making industry to justify them in concluding that the rates paid in both should necessarily be identical.. STATISTICAL.   APPENDIX.Employment Exchanges.The Unemployment Position. On the 19th August, in the United Kingdom 1,656,884, unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and out-of-work donation policies, remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,3 J 4,019, were lodged by males and 342,865, by females. At the same date, 444,365, unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 231,2J4, were lodged by males and 213,151, by females.These figures show a decrease on the previous week of 40,204 totally unemployed and 25,746 working short time.The following table shows the work of the Exchanges in respect/ of registrations, vacancies and placings during the wreek ending the 19th August :
