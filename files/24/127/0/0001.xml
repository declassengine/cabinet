However, the line of policy laid down by the latter is only one particular expression of a muoh more important aspect of our policy.   At the present moment both the internal and external policies of Soviet Russia oan be summed up in one word - Reconstruction.   All our efforts are directed towards the restoration of our economic life and to real constructive work on the basis of our social order*We shall best be able to work for the realisa-tlon of our ideals if we concentrate our efforts on realconstructive
constructive work and on the economic restoration of Russia, -jven more: this is the only way open to us at present for the fulfilment of our historic aims.   In my reports to the .-11-Hussian Central Executive Committee, and in the numerous public utterances of Comrade Lenin, the relations between Soviet Russia and its capitalistic surroundings were always characterised as a peaceful &quot;duel&quot; on the basis of the restor-ation of our destroyed economy.   He who emerges as the victor in the peaceful rivalry of economic constructive work will also be the victor in the domain of the realisation of a certain set of ideals and of a certain social order,The dominating economic position of Great Britain makes it particularly important and valuable for us to co-operate peacefully with her in the field of economic work.   In your political duties in the .3ast you must, take account both of our general position, which compels us to put to the forefront the interests of the restoration of our economic life, and of the importance which in this respect is attached to Great Britain,En approaching the problems confronting us in the East, you must be guided by the above-described basic factors of our policy.   Ours is a policy of peace and co-operation between all peoples.   At present, to the Eastern nations, being as they are, economically backward, and bitterly resenting foreign economic oppression, Socialist Soviet Russia appears as their only friend.   Our policy in the /test is not aggressive it is a policy of peace and friendship.   In the whole of your work you must always systematically put forward this basic par&amp; of our policy, andin particular, in /Kabul
Kabul, you must regard as the principal aim of your activity the furthering of  our friendship with Afghanistan.    Friend-ship pre-supposes mutual assistance;   and, proceeding from our desire to assist, as far as possible, the development and welfare of the friendly State of Afghanistan, we are ready to afford it, in the field of peace, all the assistance in our power.    You must study the needs and requirements of Afghanistan, and find out the desires Of its Government, so that we should be enabled to render it ail possible assistance in the further-ance and execution of the Ruaso-Afghah Agreement, and prompt its development and welfares    You are called upon to pay particular attention to the reformist programme of the Emir. In the present state of development of Afghanistan, an enlightened absolutism, of the type which we had in Europe in the 18th century, is a most important factor.    We cannot and mustnnot approach Afghanistan with the standard of eoonomi-oally developed oountries.    It is understood, of oourse, that we must not for a moment either forget or oonoeal the immense difference between the programme of communism and the programme which is being, or can be, effectively realised by the present Government of Afghanistan.   We must on no aocount hide our face.   But that must not prevent us from sympathising with and assisting the reformist activities of the friendly Afghan Government and the progressive work of the enlightened absolution of Afghanistan.    We are not for a moment either monarchists, or supporters of absolutism.   That must be clear to everybody.   But we support, as far as it lies in our power, the reformist work of the progressive Emir.You must by all means avoid the fatal mistake of making artificial attempts to Instil communism in a country where.there are no foundations for it.    We say to the Afghan Government:   &quot;We have one social order, you have another;   you have one set of ideas, ours are different;   however, we are
bound together by our common aims towards complete iadepondenco and self-activity of our poplos.    \U are not interfering in your internal affairs, nor are we trespassing upon tho independent activity of your people;   wo are ready to promote every factor which plays a progressive part in tho development of your people.   Not for a moment do we aim at forcing upon your people a programme which is foreign to its present stage of development&quot;!On the other hand, you must take consideration of some dangerous deviations on the part of some of the Afghan ruling classes, who dream of creating a coalition of re-aotionary Musaelman countries under th$ hegemony of Afghanistan. Up till now the British agents have supported   and furthered those dangerous aspirations of a section of the Afghan    \ government.    Wo are loyally fulfilling our agreement with Great Britain, and have the right to demand the same loyalty^ to ourselves.    You are instructed to watch carefully whothor v-the British representatives aro not continuing to play on this dangerous striving for roactionary Panislamist hegemony of some Afghan politicians, and whatnot the British agents are not in this way creating difficulties for Soviet Russia in Central Asia.Peaceful co-operation between the peoples appears to us in its concrete shape, in the first instance, in tho form of an exchange of  -cods, and in this respoctj Afghanistan is of great value to us.     It is out of placesnere to go into details of this question, this being- the object of the Narkomvnoshtorg.   I shall confine myself to pointing (mt that oven in thi3 r&amp;$imn   there are dangerous symptoms ag&amp;inst which you must be on your guard, i.e. the determination of
certain Afghan commercial circles to engage in speculation, which must inflict serious injury upon the economic life of Central Asia.   -   It is particularly the economic field of our oo-operation with Afghanistan, having in view its great Importance to us and the seriousness of the injury Jhioh can be inflicted upon tls by the above-mentioned dangerous symptoms, which prompts us to call your serious attention to the necessity of the development of our consular service in Afghanistan, provided for by the Russo-Afghan Agreement. We need consuls in Afghanistan for the development of our trade, and a3ao in order to counteract the dangerous symptoms to which I referred before.    We expect you carefully to study this question, and to send us as soon as possible full report on the economic prospects in Afghanistan, and on the problems whioh may arise in this connection before our donsuls.All the tasks which face you must be approached by you with one guiding Idea,,namely, the lengthy character? of the present period of our development and of the world&apos;s relations generally.      Historical development at this moAenx is proceeding at a slower pace.    Ihe work which we are doing; is calculated for a long term.   In the same way our relations with other States bear the character of a continued, slow1 and cumbersome work.    Of the same nature also is the political and economic work entrusted to you in Afghanistan, which is highly responsible and of the greatest importance for the whole of our existence.With Communist greetings, (Signed)     G* TCHITCHERIH.
