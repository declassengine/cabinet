.P.5227.(This document is the property of His Britannic Majestyfs Government.)CABINET.Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies, Memorandum by the Chairman (Lord Crawford).epret The Wheat Commission will present its Report two orthroe weeks hence.   Our executive functions are ended, though outstanding claims have to be adjusted both in respect of Grain operations and Mill control.   Accounting will not be completed until the close of the next Financial Year.With two exceptions my colleagues are all engaged in one branch or another of the trade, and are anxious that the Royal Warrant should be cancelled.   They are always liable to the suspicion of getting inside or advance knowledge upon business matters, and they are not prepared to maintain a nominal responsibility involving, a kind of imputation of which commercial men are apprehensive,   I am sure I can persuade some of my oolleagues to act as an advisory committee on questions of arbitration and adjustment;    but I should be reluctant if they felt impelled to resign en masse, which may be the case unless finality can be imposed on the Commission itself a   I am also influenced by the fact that so long as the Royal Warrant stands, the power to revive bread subsidies continues intact.   After the Warrant is cancelled any such scheme, which would not be unpopular in Labour circles were further wage reductions inevitable, could only be revived by a statute of first-class importance.I suggest (a) that the necessary Bill be drafted to transfer our liquidation to the Board of Trade,, as already done in respect of other foodstuffs;  (b) that the Cabinet undertake to proceed with the measure without delay on the next re-assembly of Parliament.C. &amp; B.15th August,  ln21.
