THci OOMMUjtUbliOn June 26th Nuorteva, Director of the Department of Propaganda under the Third International, presented hie report on the year!s work to tho Congress of the Third International and claimed that the Central Committee had &quot;in so far as local communist organisations had facilitated the work of the Communist International&quot; succeeded in establishing close contact with individual parties &quot;linking them up by means of its courier service.&quot;&apos; &quot;The programme of the Communist International,laid down in the twenty-one points by the SecondCongress, has &quot;been accepted by Socialist parties inall the countries of western Europe and iimerica.Of course, I have not in view tho socession of a whole party from the Second to the CommunistInternational, which would have been a brilliant achievement;   but there is no country where we have not organised among the yellow Socialists nuclei which, working uninterruptedly, are little by little transforming themselves into an effective political unit.     If we are out for imposing statistics, then the Central Committee cannot supply thorn, but if regard be had exclusively to the quality of what has been achieved, we have endeavoured to create small but stable nuclei, capable of serving as a strong and powerful fulcrum of a future party.    All our organisations are linked together in a single whole by our west European Secretariat of Propaganda, which . assiduously supervises&apos; the activity of individual nuclei, furnishing them with instructions, resources and literature.     The workers&apos; of the dost feel that they have before them a forco, proceeding straight from the working masses and unceasingly solicitous of the tollers&apos; welfare.    Tho worker begins to trust this force and a moral link is thus created between the centre and the periphery whioh - increasing in strength --transforms the whole organisation into a single powerful unit, obedient to the orders of the Central Executive.&quot;... Sub-sections of the party - subordinate to the //est European Secretariat - are disposed throughout all the States of eastern Europe.&quot;In England, Scotland and Ireland, under the control of the Secretariat, there are 176 Cowman1st nuclei^ and Labour organisations, comprising  0,000*&quot;&quot; subscribing members:   890 agitators have graduated from the Manchester and Cardiff Propaganda Institutes...&quot;Our task in the rfest during tho current year consists of an uninterrupted struggle against the social compromises in parliamentary struggle and in propaganda work, vith a view to educating tho working masses in the spirit of the Third International.     our principal/
principal attention must be devoted to a new feetor -the defence by world capital in the struggle against communist teaching,...&quot;Tom Bell, the national organiser of tho Communist Party of Great BritainJias been appointed a member of the new executive of the Communist International.Arthur MoManus is going to Russia on September 1st, fora period of three months in order &quot;to escort tho remains ofEleanor Marx Avoling, (the daughter of Karl Marx) to Russia for interment there.&quot;Meetings in London have been poorly attended:   onAugust 3rd the east Ham, Barking, Ilford and Jest Ham branchesrecommended amalgamation with a view to making &quot;communism alive thing in those districts.&quot;    The combined membership is243.The Communist Party, however, is fully alive to thepossibilities of the exploitation of the unemployed, and isorganising speakors1 classes for men out of work, so thatthey may bo ready for a winter campaign;   these meetings are held at the International Socialist Club in which the communists desire to have a controlling, as well as a financial interest.Meetings are being organised by the communists throughout the country to collect funds in aid of Russia.   It is reported that the week commencing August  1st will bo devoted to this cause:   delegates to Saturday1s conference of the London District Council have been instructed to propose that every communist give one day*s wages in every month for  : the starving Russians,Bob Stewart has been feted since his release from prison.^ About a fortnight ago a dinner, paid out of party funds, was given in   his honour at the Mars Restaurant,   Soho;   he received a boisterous welcome from his communist friends on his recent visit/
visit to Dundee and on July 29th a mass meeting of communist branch delegates was held at the Cardiff Trades and Labour Hall to welcome him baok to &quot;active work&apos;1 as   organiser of the party and as the Communist-Party candidate for the bye-election in the Caerphilly Parliamentary Division.     This contest should show some not uninteresting developments as the oommunlBts and the labour Party have already begun to quarrel. Morgan Jones, the labour Party candidate, has been active in tha division during the week;    his attaoks on the Government are much, less bitter than those on the Communist Party.     The attached letter from the iYelsh Communist Party organiser to a friend sums up the situation rather well:&quot;I am being kept very busy in South //ales and particularly now the Caerphilly election campaign is in full swing-.     The Labour Party eiomuribs   fire  . wild and at their wits end to know wha&apos;j to do now that a communist candidate is in the field.     iiftiat the result will be when the voto is taken remains to be seen, but so far our people have had much the larger makings, and in every instenoe we ha7e received a splondid hearing.     I had Dick rfallhead to contend with last Sunday in Cardiff, and despite the fact that he was booatad up to the Okies by the local Press I held the orowd against him.&quot;It is roportod that big preparations are being made bythe communists for carrying out a propaganda campaign on a largo scale in the big industrial towns of Lancashire.     &quot;Star&quot;speakers from London and Scotland are to be sent to this area and every effort is to be made to regain some of the prestige lost since the settlement of the coal strike.      In Stevenson Square two meetings are to be held every Sunday and meetings are to be held on Wednesdays in the same place.     Meetings are also to be held every Sunday in Bolton, Rochdale and tVigart. The meetings arranged to be held yesterday in   Manchester and rtigan were abandoned on account of heavy rain.On July 30th about 1,000 of the local communists and unemployed welcomed G. Fletcher on his release from Lincoln    \ Gaol and marched through the city singing the Red Flag andother/
other socialist songs.     A meeting was also held at which e. resolution was passed pro to-sting against the iimergenoy lowers Act as a !!stanC:L!a$ mou:.co&quot;.The poeit:;oii oi&apos; \,\ -s o of the Provincial branches is one of squalid financial embarrassment.!    &amp;t Coventry Dingley en, a Taylor have gone into the accounts of Glover, the literature secretary, and have found a deficit of some  4,15.0.;   it is regarded as more than a coincidence that Glover has now appeared in a new suit of clothes.     The Tree dpeech meeting held by this branch on July 24th was a failure, many workers in the audience openly laughing at the speakers.     It is proposed to carry on an oxtensive out-of-door propaganda campaign during August and September at Bedworth,  nstey, Shelton, v,&apos;a Is grave-on-Sowe and outlying districts of Coventry. Hilton, a Coventry newsagent, has refused to act as localagent any longer for the &quot;Communist&quot; owing to the action of the Coventry Districts Newsagents1 Society, who threatened toout off his supply of other papers if he continued to do so.Very littlo activity has been shown in Leicester duringthe past two weeks:   the members have no funds and only .37copies of the &apos;Communist&quot; were sold in one week.     Hewmembership cards, which will stand as credentials fortravelling agitators are to be issued;    members are somewhatconcerned that the cards are to be red, white and blue incolour.On July 28th James Stewart told the Birmingham Communist Party that they must find a room in Birmingham for the purpose of carrying on a communist school for children;   the Isxecutiveof the Communist Party is reported to have urged the necessity I for schools of this kind to be in existence in every city or *j town.The secretary of tho Gorebridge branch has written &apos;!jresigning from the Divisional Council and from his branch.)   &quot;IIreceived&quot;, he wrote, &quot;the sum of 3/2d. from leith which I have!kerejl
here; and I beg to inform the Divisional council that they owe me 3/6d. for the business of convening last meeting: I hope your next secretary will be entrusted with a little funds.The Glasgow branoh of the Communist Party has begun to appeal for funds.    At a business meeting of the Springburn branch of the Communist Party held during the week, it was deoided to invite all Trade Unions in the district to persuade their members to take in communist literature,    A special memorandum from tho Head Office of the Communist Party ofGreat Britain was read, in which It was omphaaisod as a matter4of speoial importance to all communists, that they should use every opportunity of bringing before workers the &quot;One BigUnion&quot; idea, and use every effort to propagate the view thatseotionalism was the weak point in the workers&apos; campaignwhich allowed capitalism to divide them.tThis manifesto also urged communists to penetrate asmuch as possible into Trade Union organisation, to captureall administrative positions, and then propagate communistdoctrines and tactics,    This was to be done especially inthe railways, mines and all essential public serving, and particularly Trade Unions whose members handled foodstuffs.Strong propaganda in Co-operative societies was urged, and communists exhorted to use every effort to oapture Boards of Management of these societies.    Classes on &quot;Marxian Communism&quot; are to be formed in all Co-operative Guilds.THE B&amp;D TRADE UKIOfl IMBMaTIO&amp;iLThe Red !Trade Union International officials, who did not attend the  Moscow conference, are anxiously awaiting the return of the delegates with the reports on the congress and on their reception In Russia,    On August 1st Harry Polllttj&apos; wrote the following letter from Berlin to lismer:&quot;We/
&quot;iVe are now well on our way home, and have arrived here without any mishap,    strain and Morton will follow next week and I expect you will bo seeing Watkine this week who will give you all the news.&quot;If everything works out according to plan we shall be in iilngland next Sunday or Monday when 1 , will immOdiately communicate with you.    Things are not too good, and the outlook for the future will require great consideration, but of that more anon.    Mann will ba home September or October.&quot;rfrite to me to the Bast&apos;Ham address for Monday saying what the first job is.&quot;This letter was the first intimation that Ussier had that the delegates were on their way home;   although catkins was expected to return before Pollitt he had not put in anappearance at the Central Office on August 7th.Lisrasr is trying to arrange a meeting of the Bureauon August 18th to hear the report of the delegation and a demonstration will be held.in the Cory Hall, Cardiff, onSeptember 5th when &quot;the delegates of the&quot; British Bureau will report the decisions of the inaugural&quot;Congress&apos;of theInternational Council of Trade and Industrial Unions reoentlyconcluded in Moscow.&quot;   Admission will be free but a silver, collection will be taken for the Russian Famine lund.With the exception of this demonstration at Cardiffm the first day of the Trades Union Congress, Lismer hastaken no stops for meetings in the provinces beyond requests local secretaries to be in readiness, at short notice toarrange such meetings,,    He has, however, ordered the printing and&apos;distribution of some 40,000 oopies of each of4 rthe following two rather dull leaflets:   &quot;Xfoy is an IndustriInternational necessary?&quot; and &quot;V&amp;y is -the Yellow Amsterdam Federation of Trade Unions of no use to the Workers?&quot;Pollltfa pessimism regarding the situation .1s, sharefyby wlllie Gallaoher: - in a letter to J.R. Campbell he wrote:&quot;I am sorry to hear of the threatened shipwreck. It is hard lines to think we should put out so vmuoh &apos; and yet so little apparently to show for it.   However,- &apos; wo/
771we must just plod away and hope for bettor times.&quot;There is a general depression now following the collapse of the minors strike and tho helplessness of the unions in carve oi the wage reductions.-  It will wear off and thou our chance will come.     I hope we may be ready to take it.&quot;Tho Mrorpool branch,   National Union of Eook, Riverside und General Workers, holds its half-yearly meeting soon, andthe Mersey Council of Vigilance Committees has written as follows to iCime:&quot;We are endeavouring to capture the branch, and as the officials are putting out leaflets, etc., to capture the vote and discredit the JN.W. C. we think it advisable to plaoe our position in front of tho branoh. The trouble is that we have no dou&amp;h, and therefore must rely on the general funds (if there*&quot;is any).   If you decide to print, we shall want them in eight days, or they will be useless, about two or threo thousand will do but more if possible.&quot;The circular is an appeal to the rank and file to &quot;remove the misrepresentatlves that are selling you,   &quot;Stand for Rank and file Control and oppose your treacherous misleadors&apos;.&quot;The Scottish Trades Union Congress has completed a plebiscite of affiliated unions on a proposal to join the Red Trade Union International:   a majority of tho unions has decided against affiliation.     It will be recalled that a recommendation in favour of affiliation was carried at the Aberdeen Congress last April by a small majority.The following paragraph appears in the current issue of the &quot;Worker&quot;;&quot;A Rj&amp;L SOLIDARITY&quot;And In spite of the difficulties of. their own economic situation, the Russian worker can still devote his time and energy to work voluntary Sundays and Saturdays in order to help and sympathise with you, the miners of Great Britain.    Take the following one or two examples:1,;    &quot;In Lugansk, at a general meeting of the printing industry workers, in response .to an appeal to help the striking miners of-.Britain, it was decided to send their week&apos;s earnings to jbtagland through tho Communist International.2.     &quot;The railway workers of IHcholoeV endorsed aresolution greeting the British miners, and as an expression, of solidarity, revived to work two hours a day overtime for a toz might and deliver their earnings for the banofit of the striking miners.
3.     &quot;In order to help the miners of Gt. Britain, the workers of the KiselevskL.minos (Urals) decided to e:cpress thoir faith in and solidarity with them by -working an estra shift.    They marchod to work singing the 1 Internationale1;    And called for cheers for thoir comrades abroad.     5,00u tons of coal were produced and the proceeds aro to be sent abroad.&quot; (ifistraot from loiter from Moscow, June 26th, 1921).&quot;Miners of tho Worth3 respond to the heroic i  sacrifice of our Russian comrades by sending fraternal Greetings and Resolutions of thanks.    Send thorn to J.Porter - they will be sent on to their destination. Address:   Socialist&apos; Club, Royal Arcade, Newcastle.&quot;the UflEMPIOYEDThere is ferment amongst the unemployed, particularlyin districts of the east End of London where privation seemsto bo rife.On August 8th an unemployed disturbance at the timboryard of Messrs. J. Gliksten and Son, Ltd., Stratford, was followed by the outbreak of a disastrous fire whichpractically destroyed all the buildings including the mill and mechanics1 shop, and some 20 acres of timber stacks,The firm had previously advertised for timber porters and in answer to the advertisements thousands of unemployed assembled outside the firn^s premises in the hope of securing tho vacancies, some of the men having waited all through Sunday night and others from the oarly hours of Monday morning in the hope of obtaining work.    l&apos;he majority of the men, however, were disappointed at finding that there was work for only about two dosen and in consequence they subsequently forced their way into the yard in large numbers and became very riotous, but eventually thoy were cleared by I : the police and order was restored about 10.SO a.m. - no arrests having been made.    Some hours later, however, the outbreak of fire referred to occurred in another part of the timber yard, but it is believed that this outbreak of fire wa a mere coincidence.     Some of the rioters travelled from places as far away as Southend in the hope of finding employments     It would therefore appear that the riot was notorganised/
organised by the unemployed prior to their arrival outside the premises of Messrs, J. Gllksten &amp; Son, ltd,, but some of the men belonged to the organised unemployed,The unemployed have again become active in the   I-ulham area where the principal agitators are Sidney Bonner, Samuel Raddy, Sidney Hanson end Herbert Connolly,     These men are eadeavouring to organise the unemployed on different lines from those adopted during last winter and for this purpose they have tried to secure a suitable room in which they canhold their meetings secretly.   Their object appears to be that of mating the Guardians1 position so unboarable by constant agitation that the latter will be forced to concede additional relief to those in distress.     their   efforts to secure accommodation have up to the present proved unsuccessful. Their speeches are of a very rambling nature but on August 5th Reddy said:&quot;The nest time you visit the Guardians&apos; Offloes 4on!t go upstairs, but go into the first room on the right where the oases of new suits are kept.   The last time we wera in there we tried every key we had amongst us but none of them would fit, or I should certainly have pinched a suit.&quot;The next time I go I am going to have a suit of clothes-,   - It will mean that you will have to take your measurements before you,     tie mean this.   Give your measurement in to the Committee, and wo will see that you got a suit.&quot;On the same day Hanson announced that on August 11th a deputation of the Fulham unemployed would wait upon the Pulham Board of Guardians for the purpose of placing before them their views with regard to the granting of relief to the unemployed.    He further stated that similar deputations would on the same day visit the Boards of Guardians at Hammersmith, Battersea and Wandsworth, adding that in each case the Guardians had been notified by letter of these impending visits.It is probable that these simultaneous demonstrationa have
&quot;been arranged by what is known as the &quot;South Western District Committee of the Unemployed&quot;, of which Bonner is apparently the mainspring, although himself in good . employment.My Lancashire correspondent writes that although according to the reports from the ^changes, unemployment is decreasing in the Horth western Division, there has been a &quot;slowing down&quot; this last week, and the number of persons still unemployed and on short time in Lancashire and Cheshire is still well over 400,000.     The trade revival in the cotton trade has received a slight set-back: in Preston shortage of money is the real difficulty and many employers have had to submit to cancellation of contracts because of the Inability of the buyers to buy. Thousands of engineers are out of work and many orders have been lost in Manchester through foreign competition.The depression in the iron and steel industries inBarrow and district Is serious and the iron and steel works of Barrow are shut down without any immediate prospectof again running full time.     Shipbuilders and engineerswho are on short time, are faced with the possibility of acomplete stoppage unless there is an end to the ship joiners&apos; strike.    At present the shipbuilders and engineers are on extended holidays.My Coventry correspondent sends the following report:&quot;There is certainly an improvement in the unemployment situation in the Coventry area since the settlement of the coal dispute - yet the problem is still very serious,     Trade is very bad in the engineering, boot and shoo, hosiery, iron and steel - and lace industries, and large numbsrs of workers,; are reaching the end of their resources.   Thousands will shortly have run out 6i benjfiVu under the Unemployment Insurance ict and arc wondering what will become of them when this takes plaoec     It is earnestly hoped by those unemployed that the period of benefit will be extended. .   On the other hand,&quot; thereis/
I     I-11 - 73is a section of tho public who contend that thors always will be a large body 0f unemployed so long as people are paid for doing nothing.&quot;Several attempts have been made in Leioester of late to organise a demonstration to march to the Guardians for the purposo of demanding adequate relief for the unemployed,&quot;In Birmingham there is a steady increase in the number of    employed and, in the motor industry, it is said that good orders are coming in.   imong ex-service men, however, the unemployment figures are still high,     -Sergeant Major V/agstaff, &quot;The man in chains&quot;, has recently been actively organising demonstrations in this oity.Although the numbers of unemployed in tho Glasgow district are diminishing the reduction is very gradual. The anticipated revixal of Industry at the termination of the Pair Holidays on the Glydeside is not nearly so general as was confidently expected, and engineering and other works which were closed down are commencing operations on a small scale only. In many oases the working week ia down to four days.(Egg OOiiL MLNSBBThe annual conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain will be held at Llandudno on August 17th, where it is expected that the question of the fate of the Triple Alliance will be discussed.Reports from the coalfields show that they are still in an unsettled condition and the percentage of unemployed remains high.   The decision to withhold unemployment benefit has caused concern and disappointment among the miners vfeo are out of work as a result of the recent coal stoppage.My correspondent reports that the Lancashire and Cheshire miners are anxious as to what the outs will he when the Government subsidy is exhausted;   some of the menexpress/
express the opinion that there will be.( trouble when the ^ages Board begins to adjust wages to prioos.A large number of miners In the Midland coalfields are still unemployed;   it Is estimated that 6,000 men in the Nottinghamshire area have drawn no wages ainoo the coal dispute) This unemployment is responsible for a good de^l of unrest among the miners and for strong oritioism of their   leaders, whose handling of the stoppage is now thought to be responsible for the large number of men thrown idle.    There is a growing desire among the miners for the setting up of pit oommittoes as it/is thought that many local grievances could be remedied by this moans;   colliery managers and officials ars opposed to this proposition as they say each pit would become a, ISdebating society if not a Soviet.    The situation has improvedl 1 in Xjeicestershire and Warwickshire where the mine workers arc being gradually absorbed.There is opposition among the unofficial movement in the Durham coalfield to the payment of income tax by miners;   ata conference on July 30th at which Will lawther was the chiefspeaker, one of the reasons given for refusing to pay incometax was that &quot;the money that is called for is to bo used bythe Government to pay for the lies that were printed against us in our recent struggle and; also to pay for the various methods the Government used to drive us into subjection.&quot; At the end of July several charges against local minersof unlawful assembly during the coal strike were heard at th Glamorgan and Swansea Assizes;,.tho sentences of the more prominent agitators are given below.On August 4th a meeting of the ;iouth -rnles Miners1 Federation ^secutiv6 Council was held at Cardiff to discussthe question of relieving unemployment in. the coalfield by a levy of 5 per oent   on earnings.     This proposal had been rejected,
As a result of the Borough1s refusal to obey theorder of tho Ocurb to pay precepts of the London CountyCouncil and tho Metropolitan Awyluma   Board, 51&apos;members of thePoplar/rejected by a large majority in the lodges.     It was agTeed to place the mattor before the Joint Disputes Committee.There Is a movement among the -ihondda Colliery engineraen and surface workers to break away from tho South Wales Miners1 Federation and to re-organise their old Association, tho South //ales and Monmouthshire Colliery, &amp;nginemen!s, Stokers&quot; and Craftsmen1s Association.   This move is the outcome of the South Wales Miners1 Federation debarring the craftsmen from working during the strike. Apart from being forced to withdraw their labour, the craftsmen were not given strike pay through paucity of funds in the South v/alos Miners1 Federation.    A number of local meetingsheld In the Rliondda Valley during the week showed great enthusiasm in the revival of the old craftsmenss association, and a severance with the South wales Miners1   federation.On July 8th a meeting, organised by the leaders of this &quot;break away&quot; movement, was held at the Imperial Hotel, Perth, with D,J* Jones in the chair.It has been decided to hold a conference of delegates at Cardiff when colliery craftsmen from South /teles and Monmouthshire will meet to launch the new organisation officially, form rales and elect officers.My correspondent reports that the counter-meetings organised by the South .;aIos minors Poderation craftsmen1 s agents are proving fiascos and that a &quot;majority break away&quot; of colliery craftsmen from membership of the South Wales Miners1 Federation is assured. .There is much discontent among the Lanarkshire miners, 8,000 of whom have been unable to restart work,POPLAR1S RMS
Poplar Borough Council, including George Iansbury, ildgar L&amp;lansbury, John Scurr and Sam March, wore ordered to appear on July 89th in the High Court to answer a writ of mandamus calling upon thorn to show why they should not be attached for contempt.   The councillors, accompanied by a band and some 300 unemployed.carrying silken banners, marched from Poplar.    At the Law Courts, lansbury looking vory dishevelled danced a step dance to attract attention.26 of the 31 members against whom the Divisional Court issued the writs are liable for imprisonment on August 31st if the precepts are not paid by that date.On August 7th a meeting was held in Millwall under the auspices of the South Poplar labour Party;   although only about 150 persons were present, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; describes it as &quot;one of the largest open-air meetings ever held in Millwall&quot;,     The speaker, Alderman Scurr, dealt with the subject of the equalisation of rates, referring to the fact that the rateable value of Westminster is  7,500,000 and that of Poplar  900,000.    He said that a penny rate levied on the former realized  28,000, wailst on the latter it only amounted to  3,000.     Thus if the London County  Council required  IS,000 from each of the boroughs for road repairs, Westminster by levying &amp; fourpenny rate could pay the sum in a year, but Poplar would have to borrow, and it wauld take 15 years to discharge the levy by fixing the same rate. The Poplar Borough Council is striving to bring about an equal rate for the whole of the London boroughs.     In conclusion he said that the Councillors on whom the writ of 1 attachment has been served would be glad to go to Brixton    IPrison, a place honoured by the martyrdom of Terence IMcSweeney, a man who stood and &quot;suffered for his principles at they are standing and would be willing to suffer for theirs.!The/    I
Tho following resolution was passed:&apos;that this meeting pledges itself to support the Poplar Borough Council in the action it has taken and refuses to pay the demands of the Official Receiver.&quot;CONVICTIONS1 On July 29th    J, Cook, the Rhondda miners1 leader andGeorge Dolling were sentenced respectively to two and four months1 imprisonment for unlawful assembly and inciting people to take part in an unlawful assembly at Ynyshir during the recent coal stoppage.On the same day Arthur Homer and David Lloyd Davies were sentenced to 1 month1s imprisonment each and T.H. Thomas to 2 months&quot; imprisonment for unlawful assembly at Maerdy during the same.period.SIM gBIjj IN GI&amp;AT Britain there is., a lull in Irish political activities in Great Britain pending the result of the peace conversations, but there is little doubt that the militant side of the Irish Self^Determination leaguo is still active and making ready should hostilities be renewed.Beports from Liverpool and the North show that amongst all classes and creeds there is a genuine desire for a peaceful solution of the Irish Question.    The delay over the release of J. J. McKeown caused a good deal of uneasiness and at the time when his release was announced preparations for a big demonstration were well under way*Many cf the active Sinn Feiners of the Glasgow district are still on holiday and consequently meetings are poorly attended.IRELANDThe attitude of the general public of Ireland continues to be in favour of peace, but the entire lack.of independent/
independent public opinion there is depressing.   The &quot;Terror&quot; seems to have extinguished public spirit, and there is a general foar of the. consequences of speaking out too freely.    The announcement that J.J. MclCeown has been released has eased a situation which might easily have lod to a renewal of outrages.The question of Peace hangs in the balance, and i the meantime the Jrish Republican Army is going on wit! its preparations for war and   Sinn F8in propaganda is directed towards raising the morale of their soldiers.There is unrest in Irish labour circles and some dissatisfaction expressed with the recent Congress and the talk of tha representatives of the &quot;Republican Government&quot; which will not prevent employers from, persis in reducing wages.
