.   9      164[This&quot; Poomagntjs the Property of His Britannic^Majejstyjs Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1921.SECRET.OP.-3237.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE  STATE  OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 15th instant.General State of the Country.Five weeks have now elapsed since the commencement of&quot; the truce, and although political developments during this period have proceeded slowly, the social and business life of the country has rapidly adjusted itself to the new conditions. The Annual Horse Show of the Royal Dublin Society, held during the past week, was one of the most successful of recent years, and the attendance of visitors was only slightly below that of 1913. His Excellency the Lord Lieutenant paid several visits to the Show, and everywhere met with a respectful reception. Reports from all parts of the country point to a considerable improvement in trade as the result of the removal of curfew and other wartime restrictions, and the seaside holiday resorts, particularly those on the Dublin and Wicklow coast, are enjoying an exceptionally prosperous season. The Police reports for the week contain only one case of serious political crime, the attempted murder of two Catholic workmen in Belfast. Apart from this incident the Six Northern Counties generally have been free from active disturbance, but party feeling in Belfast and its immediate vicinity is still tense and calls for the exercise of the utmost vigilance on the part of the Police. The observance of the conditions of the truce by Sinn Fein gives rise, according to the Heads of the Army and Police, to serious ground for complaint, especially in regard to the allegations of drilling and of forced requisitions of money for the equipment and maintenance of the Irish Republican Army. The cases which have been reported have been brought to the notice of the Chief Sinn Fein Liaison Officer, who has given assurances that they will receive immediate attention.Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.Sentences in fifty-eight Court Martial trials were promulgated during the week. The following&quot;is an analysis of the sentences imposed in the forty-four cases in which convictions were obtained : 3 sentences of penal servitude for life. 17 sentences of penal servitude (3 years to 20 years). 22 sentences of imprisonment with &quot;hard labour (3 months to 2 years).1 sentence of imprisonment without hard labour (6 months).1 fine of 11.Total   44The life sentences were imposed on three women for the attempted murder of an officer and private of the South Staffordshire Regiment by the explosion of a land mine near Ballynoe, Co. Cork, on the 23rd May last. Sentences of 20 years&apos; penal servitude were imposed in three cases for the possession of arms and ammunition and sentences of 15 years in two cases and of 10 years in one case for attempted murder. The remaining sentences of penal servitude were for the possession of arms and ammunition and seditious documents and for unlawful assembly and- robbery.[b798]
Other convictions included the cases of four Constables of the Royal Irish Constabulary, two of whom were sentenced to three months&apos; imprisonment with hard labour for robbery and larceny, one to three months&apos; imprisonment with hard labour for bigamy and one to six months without hard labour for assault. The acquittals included the cases of three Constables accused&apos; of robbery, larceny and assault. &apos;Internment Orders.___The following statement shows the position as regards internments up to the13th instant: Total orders made ... ... ... ...      4,202Orders cancelled for reasons other than release 144Releases ordered ... ... ... ...        408-        552Number of persons now interned    ... ... ...      3,650The number of appeals awaiting hearing is 17.State of the Police Forces.

Irish Railways Labour Crisis.I am glad to note that the threatened labour crisis on the Irish railways which appeared at one time likely to result in a general stoppage of work on the Southern railways and to impede the passage of the Irish Railways Bill has happily been averted by an agreement which was reached yesterday between the representatives of the Railwaymen&apos;s Union and the directors of the railway companies. Under this agreement it has now been decided that all matters in dispute in regard to pay and conditions of work shall be referred to an Arbitration Tribunal consisting of five members appointed by the companies and five by the unions, with an independent chairman nominated by the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and that the alterations of wages and hours of work proposed by the companies to be brought into operation immediately upon the cessation of Government control of the railways, which expired at midnight of yesterday, shall be held over until adjudicated upon by this tribunal. The Great Northern Railway Company of Ireland, which has consistently refused to recognise the general unions, is not a party to this agreement and appar-ently does not contemplate serious trouble with the local unions of its employees as
the result of whatever changes in the present standardised conditions it may feel compelled to impose.Present Political Situation in Ireland.Although the announcements which appeared in the morning press of the 13th instant to the effect that Mr. de Valera&apos;s reply to the Prime Ministers proposals was of such a nature that it might lead to a rupture of the negotiations caused a transient wave of anxiety, the optimism of the Irish public as to the eventual result has not been seriously shaken. The publication of General Smuts&apos; letter produced a profound impression, and was generally felt to have eased the situation, and when the full terms of the Government&apos;s offer were made known on the following day their reception by all sections of the Nationalist press left no room for doubt as to the direction in which the wishes of the great majority of the people of Southern Ireland have now turned. It is inconceivable that the four leading dailies, the &apos;&quot; Freeman&apos;s Journal,&quot; the &quot; Irish Independent,&quot; the &quot; Cork Examiner,&quot; and the &quot; Irish News &quot; (Belfast), which cater for the whole reading public of Nationalist Ireland, should have refrained unanimously from any hostile criticism of the proffered terms, unless under the firm conviction that the terms were incapable of final rejection by any body of statesmen claiming authority as the elected represen-tatives of the people. That there are a number of genuine Republicans holding influence in Sinn Fein councils who will resolutely oppose any compromise of their doctrines is probably true, but the power of an extremist minority to impose its will &apos; upon the rest of the nation must depend upon physical force and the opportunity for its exercise, and provided that the conditions of peaceful discussion which now exist can be allowed to continue, I do not doubt that the moderation and good sense of the majority will ultimately prevail.H GTHih Office, S.W.1, August 16, 1921.
