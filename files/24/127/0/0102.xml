/[This Document is the Property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1921.SECRET.CP. 3^9 cabinet.I circulate to my colleagues a copy of a Despatch addressed to me by the Government of India, dated 21st July 1921, No. 56, in regard to reports on the visit of His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught to India in January and February 1921.E. S. M.7th September 1921.Despatch from Government of India to the Secretary of State .for India.Simla,Sir, 21st July 1921.We have, the honour to forward, for the information of His Majesty&apos;s 1 Not circulated Government, a copy of the papers de-C1 c &apos; et&apos; tailed in the enclosed list,1 containingreports on tile visit of His Royal Highness the Duke of Connatight to India in January and February 1921.2. It will be seen from these reports that the visit of His Royal Highness was a great success, and that the non-co-operating party experienced -a correspondingly severe political reverse. Everywhere the programme of events was carried out successfully, and the failure of those who attempted to-, introduce a boycott was manifest.3. In Madras the warmth of the reception which His Royal Highness everywhere experienced was the more noteworthy in that Madras crowds are not as a rule   demonstrative.    Despite   the unprecedented ly heavy rain, which involved a good deal of uncertainty as to the Duke&apos;s movements, masses of people turned out to greet him.   A. great impression was made by the genuine tone of personal interest and knowledge which marked His Royal Highness&apos; speeches.   This contributed in no small measure to the cordial atmosphere in which the new Council entered upon its labours.   In Bengal the efforts of the non-co-operating party, although slightly more successful than in Madras, were, insufficient to mar the general harmony of the occasion.   Tickets for the various ceremonies were eagerly sought, and all the invitations.issued were fully utilised.   Here again, the courtesy and tact of His Royal Highness were greatly appreciated, while his personality excited both admiration and respect.   Some disappointment was expressed that no- striking political announcement was made, but on the whole the effect of the visit was admirable, in that it went far to introduce a more friendly attitude between the different sections of the community.   In Bombay the efforts of the non-co-operators met with utter failure.   On his arrival, His Royal Highness was received with such sustained applause, and obvious   enthusiasm, that the procession can justly be described as &quot; a triumphal progress through packed streets.&quot;   Even more striking was the manner of his reception in the mill districts.   Here large crowds stood in respectful silence, numbers of individtials &quot; paying homage to His Royal Highness in much the same manner as to a sacred emblem.&quot;   The visit to Rawalpindi, planned from the military point of view, was equally successful. An excellent effect was produced upon the Army.   The Indian officers and pensioners who were present in large numbers were particularly impressed by the obvious pleasure which Plis Royal Highness found in the military functions,   as  well as  by the fact that he was  able to converse with Indian soldiers in their own language.   Despite the purely military character cf this occasion, the efforts of the non-co-operators failed to prevent a 4595      100  9.21
considerable number of people from the city attending the review and the arrival. There was keen competition to give honorary service oi any kind in the preparations for the visit, and the demands for invitation cards were insistent. The visit of His Royal Highness to Delhi was chiefly remarkable for two things. The genuine enthusiasm displayed on the occasion of- the opening of the Chamber of Princes showed how deep-seated is the loyalty of Indian Princes to the Royal House. The Inauguration Ceremony was impressive in the extreme, and its effect will certainly be far-reaching. Secondly, the opening of the Indian Legislature, accompanied as it was by His Royal Highness&apos; touching appeal for good feeling and cordiality, was a scene which none who were present will ever forget. The effect of His Royal Highness&apos; gracious beariug and heartfelt earnestness has since been perceptible, not merely in the tone of the deliberations of the new Legislature, but also in the changing political atmosphere of India at large.4. This Despatch would be incomplete without a general appreciation of the effect of the Royal Visit on India as a whole. Both before and to some extent during the visit, attempts were made by the non-co-operationist party to organise hartals and to bring about a boycott of the various functions by the general public. Here and there a small measure of success was attained, but on the whole these attempts failed, and His Royal Highness was every-where received with marks of loyalty and enthusiasm. His accessibility and charm of manner have intensified the sentiments of devotion to the Throne and Royal Family which count for so much in India, while his personal appeal to &quot; bury with the dead past the mistakes and misunderstandings of the past&quot; at the^opening of the new Legislature, deeply affected the members of the two Houses and struck a note which continued to sound throughout the entire proceedings of the session, largely contributing to the harmonious atmosphere which prevailed. The effects of this appeal were by no means temporary or local. His Royal Highness&apos; words were widely reported and commented on. Their simplicity and obvious sincerity affected those who read them hardly less than those who heard them spoken, and though efforts have been made to belittle their meaning, we believe that the country as a whole was deeply moved, and that the successful inauguration of the new form of Government is very largely due to the fact that His Royal Highness&apos; presence in the country was a convincing proof of His Majesty the King Emperor&apos;s. personal and constant sympathy with his Indian subjects.5. In conclusion we desire to express our deep sense of obligation to His Royal Highness for undertaking this arduous but successful mission, for the gracious part he played in the impressive ceremonies at Delhi and elsewhere, and for the beneficial results upon the political situation achieved by his presence in India.We have, &amp;c,(Signed)      Reading.Rawlinson.
