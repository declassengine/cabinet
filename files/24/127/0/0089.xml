buss I,A       (Contd.)Dreadnoughts   -Armourolads -Cruisers -Destroyers of -the Novik typeTorpedo Boats 2nd Class      -Torpedo Boats -9 Officers, 106 men on each, 1 surgeon for  ships. I      g      n      i       nun u      n      ii      i surgeon for  ships 3      n Wo     1 surgeon for7 ships6 468 46133 317   &quot;      a seven 1 surgeon for ships17   &quot;     0 ten.    None.These vessels are in such condition that, even with the greatest effort, they could only he put in a state of efficiency within the period of two or three years, which is hardly prohahle because of tho condition of works and factories In Russia.(2)    To the Reserve belon? those vessels which are undergoing repairs.    They can recoivo a stronger crew; thus the &quot;and report Pervozvanni15, being- in the Reserve, has a crew of 200 instead of 68,  (the full crew would nuax.ber 890 men)(3)    The vessels of the Active Fleet are in good order,  so far as their material condition is concerned, their crews are also complete^ still this does not mean that they are ready in every respect for action.    The greatest drawback is the insufficient training of the crews (shortage of Officers and specialists), with the further lack of fuel and of various materials required for the machinery.POLAND.The military estimates total 61 milliard Polish marks (about 10,000 narks equal  1) which is one third of the whole of the National Budget0For the Navy 4 Admirals, 250 Officers &amp; 2,000 ratings are asked.
m 3 ffPART    II.    GENSSAli    TNTSIaLIGBNOS.AFGHANISTAN.The report that, the Soviot-Afghan Agreement has been signed has now been confirmed; the Afghans refuse to disclose the terms of the Treaty.INDIA.Reports from almost all parts of India show a general expectation of momentous developments in the non-co-operation programme. . Those vary from the extension of tho programme to include Civil Disobedience and refusal to pay taxes to the institution of a National Government on Sinn Fein lines.P g R S I A.The withdrawal of British troops and the vrane of British influence In Persia has resulted In many rebellious movements being started against the Persian Government.There have be on rislnprs In Persian Azerbaijan and Khorassan and &quot;Kuchik IQian is very active in Gilan.   These movements, no doubt, have &quot;been supported and enoouraf*ed by Bolshevik propaganda with a view to embarrassing the Persian Government who, being too weak to deal with any extensive insurrection,will have to seek Soviet.aid.It is expected that srbailar disturbances will occur In Southern Persia when the South Persian Rifles have been disbanded and their British Officers -withdrawn.R U S S I A.: Internal. Conditions.   The Petrograd Mint has begun collecting silver and a staff of workmen to mint silver coins. It is hoped to stamp some 50,000 roubles daily.&quot;71 th a very few exceptions, all railways In Rassia are sufferinr from lack of fuel, locomotives, and staff. Curtailment of services and congestion of traffic is general iii. all districts.,A contract has been concluded between Soviet Govem-ment and the Northern TelegraphCompany, whereby Russia is placed in telegraphic connection with the rest of Europe and.the East. )Press reports that conditions for discharging coal at Petrograd are not as. good as previously&apos; stated.     Only four cranes are working and these badly owing to bad state of repair.   A ship in harbour for 11 days only discharged.....1,000 tons.Siberia.       Ifoscow reports that Baron Ungem-Stemberg and his staff have been taken prisoners and are being sent to Russia for trial. :
HUNGARY.T U R K 5 YRelations between Italy and Nationalist Turkey have recently become more strained.   The Angora Government is anxious, however, to better theso relations their view beino: that othervd.se Italy vd.ll fail in with Great Britain, in return for this country furthering Italian interests in the Adriatic and Albania.Greek Operations?The Greek Minister for War has been at Sekishehr, and expressed great confidence as to the battle raging between the Sakharia River and Angora.The Kemalist Army is at full strength , and has possi&amp;y obtained reinforcements from Cilicia and the Caucasus.    It weuTci not be surprising if it musters 75,000.    The Greeks are making a frontal attack with their Northern and Central divisions while their Southern division Is engaged in a flanking movement.    Kemal appears to have anticipated the Greek plan, and, while making a stubborn defence In the centre, has deployed large forces on tho helixts almost as far as Angara.The Turkish left flank is the critical spot, and, If this gives, Kemal s position will be serious.General Harington reported on the 1st September that, from the latest Information received up to early that morning, neither side had gained a decisive success during the course of 8 days hard fighting, and a drawn battle was likely to be the re suiteARMENIA.,The Soviet regime as applied to Armenia is stated to be a very modified form of that obtaining in Russia, and others  is not any great interference in internal affairs.   Religion is tolerated; the clergy are not prosecuted; the right of personal property is recognised, and free trade Is permitted. The position of the Government is fairly strong-.The railways have been brought under a central control; supplies can now be obtained direot from Batum, and oil fuel from Baku.    There are some 10,000 Russian troops in the country. The internal economic situation is desperate, and the population are largely starving.    There is a cryiir* need of medicines and drugs. where is at present no alternative for Armenia to the Soviet regime: to resist it would bo to be crushed between Russia and Turkey.Considerable resistance is being-experienced in the Western Com! tats to the occupation by the Austrians of the ceded districts.It appears that ex-Hunrtarian Officers, In command of independent units., are trying to foroe the B-uiia^P^wV &amp;uv&apos;*irxrtnat a.....to Join with&apos; them in resisting the surrender of the Baxgenland.
- 5 -DANUBE.The position regarding the Danube Oonferenoe is as follows:-^The parties to the Cenferenoe signed the Convention defining the future admini3tration of the Danube on 23rd July -with the eacoepti6n of JuR-c-^Slavia. -who is quibbling. The Protocol of Signature has been left open for 3 months , to enable Jugc*-Slavia to sii?n.   Subsequent to her signature, the Convention will require ratification by the countriesv which have signed it.BULgARIA.The Bulgarians show no disposition to avail themselves of the clauses in the Treaty of Neuilly regarding the use of Dedeagatoh, and Bulgarian running rights over the railways connecting Dedeagateh with Bulgaria.     They contend that the Greeks will never allow them proper facilities s and tha.t they cannot raiso the money h-eoessaxy to make a useful port of Dede&amp;gstch.   Their ideas seem to turn towards Port Lagos.It   must be remembered that the Treaty gives Bulgaria rigit of appeal to an International Commission in the event of Greek obstruction.ALBANIA.The question Of Albania^ frentiers is now before the League of Nations-There are two difficulties to be overcome (1)   The future of the Island of Saseno.(2)   The Jugo-Slav claim for a rectification of the Albanian frontier.Robles Dcminguez, who has been endeavouring to organise a revolution and to establish a provisional Government in the State of New Laredo, has been captured by Government forces.
