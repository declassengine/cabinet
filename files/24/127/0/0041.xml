This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.secret .P. 3240.TELE  CABINET.POLICY AND FINANCE IN MESOPOTAMIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. I am at one with the Colonial Secretary in the view expressed in his memorandum (CP. 3197), that our expenditure in Mesopotamia must be very carefully scrutinized before we spend the sum of 10 million pounds on the military force there.2. I attach a Note by Mr. Crosland, explaining the basis of the estimates which he gave in Cairo.3. I cannot agree, however, to the arguments advanced in paragraph 3 of his memorandum. The conditions and standard of living necessarily imposed upon the native population by the fact that Mesopotamia is &quot; a poor, starving, bankrupt country &quot; cannot be imposed upon our troops. On the contrary, in a country like Mesopotamia the maximum of comfort possible under the conditions is necessary if white troops are to be-maintained in a state of efficiency and high morale. If the cost is too high I agree with the Colonial Secretary that it is much better to give up the mandate.4. With regard to the proposed tiansfer of the responsibility for the security of Mesopotamia to the Royal Air Force, it is to be observed that the arrangements outlined in the Air Ministry&apos;s memorandum contemplate the creation of both Naval and Military units in the shape of gunboats, armoured trains, supplies, signals, ordnance, medical, veterinary and similar services. Such wholesale duplication of the establish-ments of the Navy and Army would appear to be difficult to justify at a time when the reduction of expenditure is the dominant factor. There is, in my opinion, no possibility of a reduction in expense being thus accomplished.5. It is apparently proposed that the War Office should lend personnel to the Air Force for the purpose of running these services while, at the same time, this loaned personnel is to train the Air Force in duties appertaining to these services. It appears that we should in effect be employing our already overworked personnel on the task of training the Air Force in duties which are outside its province, and they would have the double task of performing their own normal duties and of training their proposed successors.I am not clear what considerations have led to the suggestion that the personnel of the administrative establishments to be maintained by the Air Force can be reconstructed on about one-tenth of the present scale, to which reference is made in the 5th paragraph. It is a convenient method of reducing an estimate of cost, but I cannot believe that it has any relation to fact.6. Further, another important condition under which the Air Ministry is willing to take responsibility for the security of Mesopotamia is the existence of local levies of the Arab Army. I do not know what strength or efficiency these local forces havo reached, but until they reach a certain strength and efficiency,&apos; regular soldiers must presumably take their place ; nor is there any estimate of cost.7. The only weapons which can be used by the Air Force are bombs and machine guns. I have no doubt that in case of attack the Air Force could defend themselves by these means; but the forces in Mesopotamia are intended to keep order and gradually to reconcile hostile tribes to a civilized rule. Punitive measures may have to be taken against disturbers of the peace ; the only means at the disposal of the Air Force, and the means now in fact used, are the bombing of the women and children in the villages. If the Arab population realize that the peaceful control of Mesopotamia ultimately depends on our intention of bombing women and children, I am very doubtful if we shall gain that acquiescence of the fathers and husbands of Mesopotamia as a whole to which the Secretary of State for the Colonies looks forward. More probable is it that the new King, Feisul, will complain that he cannot expect loyal co-operation of the tribes so long as their women and children are done to death.(B21/294)   100   8/21   H&amp;S, Ltd.   9416wo
He will probably be forced to call upon the Air Force to desist, and once it is realized that the Air Force can no longer use their only weapon their military value will be lost!8. With regard to the financial control, I must observe that under the Exchequer and Audit Act the Treasury directs that the department administering an expenditure shall prepare the account thereof. If the Secretary of State for the Colonies is to have the full financial responsibility he claims, I cannot handle or account for the expenditure, and must withdraw from the Middle East all financial and accounting staff, subject only to temporary loans of individuals during transition.9. The analogy which the Secretary of State for the Colonies makes between Mesopotamia .and East and West Africa is attractive, but I think false. In the first place the troops in East and West Africa raised by the local authorities are not on the War Office establishment. There are no white troops in these Protectorates. The proposal, taken in conjunction with the claim for full financial control, would remove from the garrison of Mesopotamia all army jurisdiction, and would put the force in a position equivalent to that of the Army in India with the difference that &apos; the Government of India is responsible for the military security of the country, while, in the case of Mesopotamia, the War Office is still to be responsible for its defence from outside attack, though the Colonial Office is to have control over its garrison, and is to choose the commanders and take responsibility for every act, military or civil, necessary for maintaining internal order.10. It is true that the Colonial Office in the case of East and West Africa may raise its own troops and choose its own commanders, &amp;c, but it would be impossible to apply this principle to British troops whose officers are on regimental lists which could not be interfered with by the local Mesopotamian authority. Moreover, the independent control suggested in paragraph 7 appears to me to be inconsistent with the remark in paragraph 8 that it is the right and duty of the War Office to prevent their troops from being placed in positions considered undesirable or dangerous. There appears to me to be some confusion of thought in these two conceptions which would prove impossible to carry out in practice.11. I am further disturbed at the suggestion contained in paragraph 11, which contemplates the evacuation of the countiy in the event of its rising, with the rescue of the Imperial personnel, which, it can only be presumed, would leave the rank and file of the local levies (who may be prepared to stand by us) to their fate. If the local levies realize that a general rising will result in their desertion by the British troops, I do not think we shall have any guarantee for their loyalty or for that of the population.Evacuation is suggested as an alternative to the possible necessity for reinforcing troops which, by themselves, are admittedly unable to hold the country in case of a general rising.But leaving our friends in the lurch has not hitherto been a policy of the British Government, and I feel that we ought not to shut our eyes to the possibility that, when calamity arises, we may not be willing to put the policy in operation, and that we may, therefore, be called uqaon to send reinforcements to extricate our small beleaguered garrison.12. I believe that we cannot reduce our garrisons in the way suggested without maintaining a large reserve.13. I agree with the Colonial Secretary that the cost, on the scale which seems to me necessary, will be such that ic is better at once to make arrangements as speedily as our commitments permit, for abandoning our mandate and evacuating the country.14. I have not had time to do more than dictate a somewhat hurried note on the objections which are apparent and which I may summarize as follows : (i.) The military garrison proposed is altogether inadequate.(ii.) The Air Force, even if allowed to have a land army and run the gunboats, &amp;c,is ill equipped for the purpose proposed, (hi.) It is undesirable and uneconomic to allow the Air Force to depart from itspresent functions of an ancillary force, (iv.) The estimates of future cost are illusory.(v.) The proposals as to financial and executive control by the Colonial Office of troops of the British Army are unconstitutional and would lead to hopeless confusion.L. W.-E.The War Office,17 th August, 1921.
Note by Mr. j. B. Crosland on paragraph 1 of Mr. churchill&apos;s Memorandum for the Cabinet (CP. 3197), dated 4th August, 1921.Mr. Churchill compares the figure of 4^- million pounds which I hazarded at Cairo for the normal annual cost of a 12-battalion garrison with a figure, which he quotes at 10 million pounds, for the estimated cost in 1922-23.The two figures are not comparable. The million pounds, whether it was a good shot or a bad one, never represented the estimated cost in 1922-23; it was an attempt to give the normal annual cost, exclusive of either terminal charges or capital expenditure, of a garrison of 12 battalions (viz., 2 British and 10 Indian), 1 cavalry regiment, 1 Royal Field Artillery battery and 1 pack battery, with suitable depart-mental and ancillary troops not worked out.   The latter I put at 3,000, all ranks.As regards the figure for 1922-23, it was never possible to suppose that the cost, which, apart from the reductions decided upon at Cairo, would have been some 28 million pounds in the current financial year, could be reduced to 4j million pounds within a year. Pending the preparation of a proper estimate, I have never given a figure of less than 10 million pounds for the probable cost of the garrison in 1922-23 ; I gave this figure to the Treasury semi-officially on 14th April, 1921, as the best guess that I could then make. I do not know when the round 10 million pounds was first mentioned to the Colonial Office, but I quoted it again in a note to Mr. Vernon (which he showed to Mr. Churchill) on 14th June, just before the debate on the Middle East Estimates,The provisional estimate we have now given to the Colonial Office for 1922-23 is shown at the foot of page 2 of Mr. churchill&apos;s memorandum, and includes 7,159,400Z. for current maintenance of a 12-battalion garrison. In comparing this figure with the 4j million pounds it must be borne in mind that the former figure represents a garrison of 7 British and 5 Indian Native battalions, while the 4^ million pounds given at Cairo was (as already stated) for 2 British and 10 Indian battalions. Further, the number of departmental and ancillary troops now proposed by the military authorities for 1922-23 are over 6,000 as against the 3,000 which I allowed for at Cairo.Apart from the different composition of the garrison two other causes have caused an increase on the 4j million pounds figure : (1.) The local charges now estimated by the General Officer Commanding for 1922-23 are much larger than those given to me by Colonel Frith at Cairo. (2.) In the absence of all data I included 500,OOOZ. for sea transport, whereas the figure now put down for 1922-23 is over 900,0&apos;OOZ.J. B. C.
