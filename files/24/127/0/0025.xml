(This document is the property of His Eritannio Majesty&apos;a Government).OABXKETHOME AFFAIRS OQMMITTEE, fiORET. &quot; * -OIHTKRI^ATIOKAL LABOUR COHFFRKiiCE.i m.*&apos; Weekly Rest Day.(Memorandum by the Home Secretary).The Hone Affairs Committee at its meeting on the 14th June discussed the line to be taken with reference to the question of the weekly rest day in industry, which is to be considered at   the next International Labour Conference in October.The Committee decided that the Government could support the adoption by the Conference of a Recommendation on the subject, and possibly even a Convention, but before committing itself to the proposal of a Convention., the Committee desired to see what the legislation necessary to give effect to such a Convention would be like.     Instructions were accordingly given that the Home Office should prepare a draft Bill in consultation with the Ministry of Labour, whose representative at the meeting had submitted to the Committee several objeotions to the adoption of the Convention.     The Bill has now been prepared in consultation with the Ministry of Labour and I circulate copies to my colleagues.     An attempt has been made in the Bill to meet some at least of the difficulties which had been raised by the representative of the Ministry at the previous meeting.   The draft is not, of course, final, but is sufficient to show the lines on whioh legislation, if it became necessary, would probably run,I understand the Ministry of Labour still feel considerable hesitation about   agreeing to the introduction of legislation, and do not see their way to support the proposal of an International Convention.In view of their opposition I cannot press my colleagues to go further than their previous decision to support a Recommendation, but I would suggest that if our Delegates at the Conference find that the Conference is practically or nearly unanimous in favour of a Convention, the Government should have a further opportunity of considering the matter, and that the Delegates should be instructed to report home fully on the situation,and ask for   further instructions as to whether, in the circumstances, it might not be desirable for them to vote for the Convention,E.S.13th August, 1921.
