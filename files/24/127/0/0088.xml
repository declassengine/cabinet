UNEMPLOYMENT.   AMD    PAUPERISM.There is no doubt that the situation in regard to un-amployment is grave, especially in view of the activities of the Communist party.   The problem is not quite the game as that which confronted the Cabinet Committee a fortnight ago, or perhaps it would be more correct to say that the problem has assumed a fresh aspect.   When the Cabinet Committee last con-sldered this matter they were concerned to take steps to prs-vent the Communist from exploiting the hungry man.    It was then suggested on behalf of the Ministry of Health that there was no reason why any man should go hungry as he could obtain Poor Law relief, and, further, that the Guardians by means of loans or overdrafts would be able to meet their abnormal expenditure. Nothing th&amp;t has happened since then calls for a revision of that view, but, on the one hand, Guardians and local authorities In many instances are claiming that the cost of relief should be met by the State rather than by the ratepayers, and on the other hand the Communists have been organising the unemployed to demand extravagant scales of relief.Taking England and Wales as a whole, pauperism is now at a lower level than it was in July during the period   of the Coal Strike, but it has been Increasing in London.   The figures are:-London.Total.England&quot; ana Wales.26th March, 1921. 2nd July, 1921, 13th August, 1921. 20th August, 1921.:: &apos;    &apos;   .&quot;-v -27th August, 1921.124,590 135,840 148,62&amp;151,344 156,871653,517 1,331,124 971,921960,078 (Approx.

Apart from the special difficulties of the Treasury at the present time the objection to State assistance is, of course, that it would probably involve Increased taxation
and thereby increased unemployment.    Assuming that the ex-t ens ion of unemployment benefit is ruled out, State assistanoo might be given in two general ways,  (1) as a oontribution to-trards tho cost of relief works, and (2) as * subsidy in aid of Poor Law expenditure.   The objection to the first is that relief works are generally extravagant, and to some extent demoralising, and that the local authorities, with the present high rates, are reluctant to embark upon any undertakings which are not urgently necessary at the present time.   The real advantage of relief works lies in their psychological effect at an indication that the authorities aro anxious to do some-thing f&amp;T the unemployed and also because they help to keep the unemployed out of mischief.   The subsidising of Out-door Relief from the Exchequer is open to grave objection in principle, and, as previously pointed out to the Cabinet Committee, there is no machinery in existence which could be utilised to prevent the extravagant authorities from exploiting the rest of the community.    The recent example offered by Islington and Poplar lends force to this argument,Scales of Relief.    The Press seems to have rather exaggerated the tendency of Boards of Guardians to give way to the claims of the unemployed for extravagant scales.    With a few exceptions, the Guardians in London as w*ll as in tho provinces, appear to be steering a reasonable middle course between adequate assistance and extravagant relief.   The Islington scale for a man, wife, and six children, amounts to approximately  3. 13. 6 per week.   This scale may very well be compared with that of one of the very best Boards of Guardians in the country, namely Birmingham, where the scale for a man, wife, and fix children, amounts to approximately  1. 19. 7, but it is understood that the Birmingham Guardians contemplate increasing this scale by another 5/- in the winter.    If the Ministry of Health moke it plain that they are
not going to countenance extravagant relief it is believed that a - very large majority of the Boards of Guardians throughout the country will stand firm.   Warnings given to some of the Boards of Guardians, both in London and the provinces, that the Ministry would take this course have already had effect.   The Ministry of Health have been in communication with the Executive of the Poor Law Unions Association and the general lines of the policy to be pursued have been agreed upon.    It Is proposed that a circular&apos; should be issued at once to all the Boards of Guardians in the country intimating that the Ministry of Health will not sanction extravagant relief.   If any Board of Guardians gives relief In excess of an amount approved by the Ministry th$ relief so given will become unlawful and the Guardians, and all those who facilitate the payment of such extravagant relief, will do ao at their own risk and will be liable to disallowance and surcharge by the auditor.   Further, it will probably be open to any r&amp;tepayer to apply to the Courts for an injunction to restrain the Guardians from giving such relief, and the banks, which in many cases are the Treasurers to the Guardians, would refuse to allow an overdraft for the purpose of relief, if they knew that the Department would not be willing to sanction interest on such overdraft where relief was given contrary to the views of the Ministry of Health. The principle which the Ministry propose should govern the amount of relief which may be lawfully given is that it should not be of an amount which would place the recipient of relief In as good a position as that of the independent workman who is maintaining himself,by his wages.Further, the Ministry propose to insist upon adequate Investigation of the circumstances of each case and to press the Guardians to give the greater proportion of the relief In k ind,3c
