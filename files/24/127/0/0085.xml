&quot;A&quot;0.282(a) M.206.1921.LEAGUE OF NATIONS.REPORT BY VISCOUNT ISHIIOn the request addressed by the Supreme Council of the Allied Powers to the Council of the League of Nations to find a solution of the question of Upper Silesia.Adopted by the Council on August 29th, 1921.The Members of the Council have been informed of the letter ated August 12th, addressed to me by M.Briand,  on behalf of the upreme Council of the Allied Powers,     This letter Informed me of he resolution in which the Supreme Council decided : In ptirsuance of Article 11, paragraph 2 of the Covenant of the eague of Nations, to submit to the Council of the League the ifficulty attending the fixing of the frontier between Germany nd Poland in Upper Silesia, and to invite the recommendation of he Council as to the line which the Principal Allied and Associated owers should lay down&quot;.In my reply dated August 19th, I expressed the hope that lie Council, whose advice is asked without reserve and without sstriction, would accept the Invitation contained in the Resolution I the Supreme Council and that it would shortly be able to present unanimous recommendation.     At the same time I convened the taicil Meeting at Geneva for to-day.My first duty is to ask for the approval of the Council what I have thought necessary to do in its name in my capacity Acting President.      If this approval is given, I would present the Council a few preliminary observations on the position the problem now su-omitted to you, that is to say, on the nature the difficulties mentioned in the letter of the President of Supreme Council and for which he asks you to seek a solution.
The matter la brought before the Council under Article 11 paragraph 2j of the Covenant of the Leaguej which reads as follows:-&quot;It is declared to be the friendly right of each Member of the League to bring to the attention Of the Assembly or of the Ccuncjl.any circum-atances whatever affecting international relations which threatens to disturb international peace or the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends.&quot;The circumstance which led to the request of the Supreme Council is clearly one of those for which the text Just quoted provides.Disturbances have recently occurred in Upper Silesia. A. marked difference continues to exist between the various solutions proposed for the settlement of the territorial problem. These two facts are proof of the urgent necessity of a settlement in the interest of peace and good understanding between the nations.     Article 11 does not ciearly lay down what ehould be the action of the Council in such a case.The letter which I have received is however very clear on this point;   you are asked for a recommendation &quot;as to the line which the Principal Allied and Associated Powers should lay down&quot;.     The right of the Council of the League of Nations to make a recommendation when requested by one or several of its Members, is not explicitly laid down in Article 11 of the Covenant, but is implied,  I may say, by the whole Covenant. On the other hand, Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty of Versailles formally attribute to the Allied and Associated Powers the right to take a final decision with regard to the frontier between Germany and Poland in Upper Silesia. - Article 87, paragraph 3, is explicit:
&quot;The boundaries of Poland not laid down in &quot;the present Treaty will be subsequently determined by the Principal Allied and Associated Powers.&quot;Article 88 referring to the plebiscite provided for Upper Silesia reads as follows:-&quot;Germany hereby renounces in favour of Poland all rights and titles over the portion of Upper Silesia lying beyond the frontier line fixed by the Principal Allied and Associated Powers as the result of the Plebiscite.&quot;The position of the Council Ls clearly defined by these provisions.     The Powers represented on the Supreme Council have requested the Council of the League to make a recommendation which it is entitled to make and to transmit to those Powers which alone, according to the Treaty, can take the filial decision.Apart, however, from the rights definitely conferred upon the Allied Powers by the Treaty of Versailles, and upon the Council of the League by the Covenant, we have to take into account a new fact,  the importance of which my colleagues will fully appreciate.     I have received from M. Briand, a statement dated August 24th, giving a historical summary of the question since the opening of the Peace Conference, which I have the honour to lay before you.     It concludes with a statement of the divergence of views which continue to exist on the question of the frontier in Upper Silesia and concludes in these terms:-&quot;In view of this situation, the Supreme Council decided on August 12th to have recourse to the Council of the League of Nations in the terms contained in the letter addressed on the same day by M, Briand to M. le Viscount Ishii, each of the Governments represented having in the course of the discussion solemnly undertaken to accept the solution recommended by the Council of the League of Nations&quot;.
I consider that, under these circumstances, it is not only the right hut also the duty of the Council to accept the role which, in the spirit of the Covenant, it has been asked to assume, and in the fulfilment of which its liberty of action and authority will be fully guaranteed.II.I now come to the difficulties, alluded to in the letter of the Supreme Council, which the Council of the League should take into consideration In seeking an equitable and satisfactory solution of the problem.The Council is aware of the provisions of the Treaty relating to upper Silesia.     Article 88 lays down that in the Upper Silesian Territory Included within certain fixed boundaries, the inhabitants will be called upon to indicate by a vote whether they wish to be attached to Germany or to Poland.     An annex to this article determines the procedure of the plebiscite.     The first problem which arises is the following:     According to the &apos;Treaty should the results of the plebiscite determine by a single vote the fate of all the territory under consideration, or lead to the tracing of a frontier line which may or- may not divide this territory?By Article 88, already quoted, &quot;Germany renounces in favoiir of Poland, all right and title over the portion of Upper Silesia lying beyond the frontier line fixed aa by the Principal Allied and Associated Powers as the result of the Plebiscite.&quot;     Para-graph 5 of the Annex lays down that the Commission entrusted with&apos; the organisation of the Plebiscite, shall communicate to the Allied and Associated Powers, together with the results of the vote &quot;a recommendation as to the line which ought to be adopted as the frontier of Germany in Upper Silesia,&quot;   We read in par, 6:-
&quot;As soon as the frontier has been fired by the Principal Allied and Associated Powers, the German authorities will be notified by the International commission that they are free to take over the^administration of the territory which it is recog-nised should be German;   the. said authorities must proceed to do so within one month of such notification and in the manner pre-scribed by the Commission.   .Within the same period and in the manner prescribed by the Commission the Pollph. Government must proceed to take over the administration of the territory which it ie recognised Eih.6r.id be Polish&quot;.Finally,, according to Article 90, &quot;Poland undertakes to permit for a period of fifteen years the exportation to Germany of the products of the mines in any part 6f Upper Silesia transferred to Poland in accordance with the present Treaty&quot;.Clearly what tke authors of the Treaty desired was the determination of a frontier, no particular line being either prescribed or excluded in advance.III.The Treaty docs, however, lay down the guiding principles which should govern the decisions     Those principles are expressod in the directions given to the Commission for Upper Silesia when instructed to prepare a draft scheme for a frontier line..     They were to the effect that &quot;in this recommendation regard will he paid to the wishes of the inhabitants as shewn by the vote, and to the geographical and economio conditione of the locality&quot;.  :. The wishes of the inhabitants were expressed by the vote of March 20th, 1921; which was taken by communes on a basis of universal suffrage for both sexes,I do not propose to enter into details either on the political
or the economical aspects of the question, or to say anything that , might in the least prejudge the method which the Council may wish to adopt with a view to a careful study of the vhole problem...The results of the plebiscite in Upper Silesia were unfortun-ately not of a nature to allow the frontier line to be drawn according to the wishes of the population, nor did the economic and. geographical conditions of the localities give any decisive indications to shew how a line should he determined.Indeed, the fact that the two considerations had to be taken into account only complicated the situation.The plebiscite showed that, taking Upper Silesia as a whole, in certain districts towards the Worth and West, where the agricultural population is predominant, a great majority of the communes voted for Germany.     In other districts, towards the South, where the inhabitants are chiefly of the agricultural and mining classes, the vote of the population was largely in favour of Polando In an extensive territory in the Centre and East, the voting was of a very confused character.     Here are to be found the metallur-glcal and chemical works and important deposits.of coal, zinc and iron.     The majority of the communes voted for Poland.     Although in the big towns large majorities were recorded for Germany, these toxins are encircled by the Polish voting communes.     It is to be noted that, although in a sense they form a network of their own, they are partly dependent for essential raw materials on outside districts.     They are situated near the extreme Eastern limit of Upper Silesia, geographically distant from the bulk of the German voting communes, though the districts which separate them from these communes are not thickly populated.The exact list of the communes and. of the voting will be found in the official journal of Upper Silesia of which my colleagues have a copy.
My objeot in singling out these facts is simply to draw your attention to the special political and economic difficulties in the different districts of Upper Silesia,     But we must not only concentrate our attention on any one of these districts apart from the others, since the problem of Upper Silesia Is laid before us as a whole and in all its bearings.The delicate task of tracing a frontier corresponding to the wishes of the people is rendered even more difficult.by the obligation to meet at the same time very complex economic needs. It is not surprising that on such a thorny problem the solution of which affects such important interests, different and not easily reconcilable opinions have been expressed with equal sincerity.     As to the history of the question, and to the technical work al-eady done, I beg to refer my colleagues to the documents transmitted to ua by the Supreme Council.The question has been submitted to the Council of the League of Nations.     The Council should first decide whether it will accept the task which the Supreme Council asks it to undertake, and if It does accept, . it must then Jeter-mine the procedure which it considers most likely to achieve the desired end; that Is to say, to contribute, in conformity with the spirit of the Covenant, to the satisfactory settlement of a Complicated question whose solution cannot be further postponed without great prejudice to general peace.

Translation me.de, by the Secretariat of the League,.I.HISTORICAL SUMMARY OF THE WORL OF TE2 PIS ACE CONFERENCE ?M THE QUESTION OP UbPBR SILESIA,The task of submitting proposals for the delimitation of the frontiers of Poland was, on February 86th, 1919, entrusted by the representatives of the five &quot;Principal Powers to a Committee called the Committee on polish Affairs consisting of the following members;.&apos; Dr. BQ-JMAJJT (U.S.A.), SIR , WILLIAM TYRRELLfLritish Empire), K,3. JULES. CAMSON (France)   (Chairman) ,: MARQUIS BELLA TORRETTA (Italy), and M., OTGHIAI (Japan).-On the proposal of a Sub--Committee consisting of General LE ROTO (France,)  (Chairman),    LRo BOWMAN (U.S,A.)y. ana Lt.-Ool. FISCH (British Empire) , this Committee unanimously laid before the Council a draft scheme whioh fixed as the frontier between Poland and Germany in the district of Upper Silesia the line which at present, and in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles, forms the western boundary of the plebiscite territory.The Report of the Committee on Upper Silesia was adopted by the Supreme Council en March ISthj 1919; the definition of the German-Polish frontier, given as an annex to this report, was inserted without modification in the peace terms which were handed to the German Delegation on May 7th, 1919.Thus, in accordance with these terms of peace, Upper Silesia was allotted without reserve to ioland.On May 29th,  Count Erockdorff-Rantzau submitted to the President of the Conference the &quot;observations of the German Delegation with regard to the peace terms.&quot;   Therein he maintained that there was nothing to justify the allotment to loland of Upper Silesia.
(a) because there had been no connection between Upper Silesia and the Polish Lingdora since 11653&apos;; Poland, therefore,  could, not lay any legal claim to the country.(b) because Upper Silesia was not inhabited by a popu-lation which was indisputably Polish.(c) because the development of the country was due entirely to Germany who could not, from an economic point of view, do without the territory, whereas Poland would have no need of it;, without Upper;Silesia, Germany could net fulfil its obligations anc: the peace of the world would be in danger.As a result ox this protest,  the question was again examined by the &quot;Council of Pour&quot;, which decided to modify the original peace terms and to organise a plebiscite for Upper Silesia.    The intentions of the Council in deciding to institute this plebiscitewill be seen in the Resolution which, on June 4th, 1919, instructed.-a Committee entitled. &quot;The Committee on the Eastern Frontiers^ of fiermany&quot; to draft the new clauses to be inserted in the Peace Treaty.    The duty of the Committee, which consisted of I?BV LORD (U.S.A.) , MR. RE^DLa^-MCRLEY (British Empire) , GEliURAL LE ROIID (Prance), and MARQUIS BELLA TORRSTT^,  (Italy), was to amend the clauses of the peace terms in accordance with the following&apos; irinoiplesi&quot;(a) Steps to be taken to secure the acceptance by Germany of a plebiscite with regard to the parts of Upper Silesia transferred to Poland by the Draft Treaty of Peace with Germany.   Tho Committee shall draw up the general conditions of the plebiscite.(b) Steps to be taken to ensure to inhabitants of Germany the right to purchase coal from the mines of Upper Silesia on the same terms as the inhabitants of Poland, if it should happen that the plebiscite resulted in the transfer of sovereignty of the greater part of Upper Silesia to Poland.(c) Modifications to be introduced in the application toUpper Silesia of lerts 3 and 4 of the economic clauses   , as regards the    treatment of property of German nationals, the procedure to be applied in the case of goods/Sold by Polish Government,  and as regards compensation for owners should it occur that the plebiscite resulted in the transfer of sovereignty over the greater part of Upper Silesia to Poland.
The Committee, which met on June 6th, completed its work on June 10th.   It was unanimous on all points, except with regard to the Question whether the plebiscite should take place within a short or a long period.    The Council of Pour decided on June 14 that the period should be from six to eighteen months.The final decision Of the Conference was embodied in Articles 88 and annex, 90 and 91 of the Treaty of Versailles.On communicating this to the Germans on June 16th, theAllied lowers at tho same time forwarded the following observations:(Reply to the, observations of the German Delegation);&quot;It is admitted that this problem differs  rom that ofPosnania and Western Prussia, for the r eason that   Upper Silesiadid not form part of the Polish Kingdom when the latter was dis-membered at the time of the Partition.   It may he maintained thatclaimPoland cannot legally/that Upper Silosia should be ceded to her; but it must be solemnly declared that it is not true that she possesses no rights capable of being maintained in accordance with the principles of President Wilson.   In the districts in question, the majority of the population is undoubtedly Polish.    All special German treaties, all school text books, teach German children that the inhabitants are Polish in nationality and language.   The Allied and Associated Powers would have entirely violated the principles which the German Government itsulf claims to accept, if they had not taken Polish rights over this distriot into account.&quot;The German Government, however, now disputes these con-clusions.&quot;It maintains that separation from Germany is not in accord-ance with the wishes or interests of the population.    Under thesecircumstances, the Allied and Associated powers are disposed toleave the question to be determined by those whom it particularlyconcerns.    They have, therefore, decided that this territory should not immediately be ceded to Poland, but that steps should be taken for the organisation of a plebiscite.
BR^-IL^TIQH^;, .THB PjGilBISCITB,By the Treaty it was the duty of the; Intetf-*i&amp;lLLed .Corn-mission, provided for in the Annex to Article 88, to flic the procedure of the Plebiscite.    This Commission was composed oft-General le Rond (prance)    (Chairman)Colonel Percival (British Empire),replaced in June 1521 by Sir Harold Stuart;and   General de Marinis (Italy). One of the principal questions which the Commission had to decide way the interpretation of- the terms of the Treaty which determined the catagories of&apos; persons having the right to vote.-The Treaty (article 88; Annex, Paragraph 4B)    stipulates that, in addition to all   persons born in the plebiscite area, the right to vote shall be given to all persons * provided that they are domiciled in the area from&apos; a date to be determined by the Commission, which should not, however,, be subsequent., to January 1st, 1919.      In conformity.with this provision, the Commission fixed January 1st, 1904 as the date after vh ich the fact of residence in Tipper Silesia should not confer the, right of taking part in the plebiscite,.     This dato was chosen because it coincided with the coming into force of the German Colonisation Laws;    it is,.-moreover, a date subsequent to the decrees passed to prevent the polish workmen of Russian orAustrian origin from obtaining a domicile in the province...There was also another question to be considered:,   the majority of the Commission,ba;3Bing themselves upon paragraph 4 of the Annex to Article 88 of the Treaty of Versailles,, considered that any per jori born in the plebiscite area had
the right of voting, even if they bad not retained their domicile in the area.The minority of the Commission, on the other hand, invoicing the first paragraph of Article 88 of the Treaty, which stipulates that the inhabitants will be called upon to indicate by a vote whether they wish to be attached to Germany or to Poland, maintained that the persons born in the plebiscite area, and who had not retained their domicile there,. could not claim the right to vote, except in so far as they should be granted the status of resident by virtue of the regulations governing the plebiscite,On November 25th, 1920, the Supreme Council, meeting in London, confirmed the interpretation given by the majority of the Commission - a confirmation which was in accordance with the precedents furnished by the plebiscite of Schleswig, Allenstein and Marienwerder, where provisions had been made in regard to this matter similar to those of Article 88 and its annex.    The Supreme Council decided,, moreover, to propose to the German and Polish Governments that such electors as were not domiciled should bo concentrated, for the purpose of voting in some place outside the plebiscite area,;;   in ceso of non-acceptance of this proposal, the domiciled electors and the non-domiciled electors would all vote in Upper Silesia, but on different dates.The first solution was rejected by the two Governments concerned, and the Conference of jimbassadora at its meeting of December 15th,. 1920, asked the Commission to make provisions for the application of the second solution..- 1&apos;6 -
Objectiond1 to this procedure were raised at a later date by a majority of the Commissioners:   as agreement at the Council of Ambassadors could not be reached, the Supreme Council decided on February 2ist, 1921, that *&apos;the plebiscite shall be taken in one day, on March 20th if possible, and ih any case at the earliest possible date.&quot;A copy of the regulations governing the plebiscite, which was published by the Commission, is attached.III&apos;.TOin z.&apos;,n:ar,3di?Eo1TOTOETATI033 OF, THS RESULTS .The plebiscite took place on March 20th, 1921, without any remarkable incident;    the counting and checking of the votes took a considerable time.       The results were proclaimed by a decree of the Commission dated April 24th and published in the with the stipulations of the Treaty, the result/by communes weeUnder these circumstances, the Commission had not yet seriously entered upon the discussion of the frontier line, when the Governments who were desirous of settling the -question without delay, asked them to hasten the presentation of their report
as the Surpens Council was due to meet in London at the end of April,,    This report, which was also communicated to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, was accordingly addressed on April 30th to the President of the Supreme Council without the Commissioners having been able to agree on a common proposal; it arrived, however, too late to enable the Council to consider its contents.    Moreover, at that moment the Polish insurrection broke out.    Any decision on the frontier line had to be postponed for several weeks.When, on June 20th, the British, French and Italian Govern-ments invited the Allied Commissioners to consider whether they could not resume the examination of the question with a view to putting forward a common proposal, it was evident that, under the circumstances,  it was not possible for them to do so, and that, moreover, the fundamental differences of opinion between them which had previously appeared still existed.The Allied Powers were of opinion that under these conditions they had no option but to consider the problem themselves, how-ever, in order to reconcile possible differences of opinion, it was decided that a Committee of Experts should be convened a few days before the meeting of the Supreme Council, fixed for August 8th, in order to undertake a further investigation of the question.No. IV.Work of thei Committeei of Experts and the Meeting, of the Supreme Council,.(July 20th - August 12th, 1921),The work of the Committee Of Experts, which was begun on July 28th, was completed on August 6th.    The Report which it presented to the Supreme Council, and which was also forwarded to/
to the Council of the League of Nations, &quot;brought out clearly the difficulties which the Committee had encountered.The Committee reached entire agreement as to the legal inter-pretation of the Treaty; it was therefore led to reject the solution which favoured the handing over of the territory in its entirety, and which considered the results of the vote as a whole.    It also &amp;ave general indications as to the degree of importance to be assigned to the geographical and economic conditions referred to in the Treaty,  (See pages 1 and 2 of the Report).    On the other hand, it did not succeed in reaching an agreement on a frontier line.    In particular difference of opinion was revealed as to the right method of defining and describing the industrial and mining   area of Upper Silesia, one delegation isolating in this area an 11 indivisible triangle&quot; which could be separata!T.rcm the southern part of the area, and which contained a German majority, another maintaining that the mining and industrial basin formed a single unit and that it was not possible to imagine   the separate existence of the &quot;industrial triangle&quot;.The Report of the Committee, which was communicated to the Council of the League of Nations, sets out in detail the various points of vi sw.As the Committee was unable to agree upon a frontier line, it did not have to consider certain suggestions made by the technical experts, which are mentioned, in its report.The conflicting views were presented fully on August 8th and 9th at the Supreme Council,    The discussion revealed the fact that the whole difficulty was due to the close neighbourhood of the centre part of the industrial area of Urban Communes which had recorded large German majorities and suburban or rural Communes which had recorded   Polish majoritiesj       Inorder to arrive at an agreement the Council on August 9th adopted the following resolution:-
&quot;By reason of the difficulties due to the juxtaposition in the centre of the portion.of Upper Silesia known under the name of the industrial zone of urban communes, which have given strong German majorities, and suburban or rural communes, which have given Polish majOfities, by reason also of the necessity of conciliating so far as possible the situation with the principles laid down in the Treaty.The Commission .-Of Experts, reinforced by the High Com-missioners was asked oftce more to examine the quest-ion and to present a report, showing what communes for economic or topo-^-graphical reasons cannot be separated- from the great urban communes referred to above,. The repert will also indicate what railway lines are necessary for the commercial existence and the prosperity of this district.&quot;Having resumed its investigations /the Committee -succeeded in determining in the centre of the indivisibXe area, a certain number of indivisible groups some of which had a Folish majority, others   a German majority.The Committee were unanimously Of opinion that the frontier line, wherever it might be drawn., could not pass through either one or other of these groups, which, moreover, were more or less intimately connected with each other..The Committee could not agree on the ether hand as to what extent these connections prevented the tracing of the frontier line separating one set of groups from another.On the basis of those conclusions fresh negotiations took place among the various delegations, but did not lead to an agree- -ment.In view of this, situation the Supreme Council decided on August 12th to have recourse to the Council of the League of Nations in the terms contained in the letter addressed on the same day by Monsieur Briand to Monsieur le Viscount Ishlu, each of the Govern-ments represented having, in the course of thesiscussions solemnly undertaken to accept the solution   recommenced by the Council of the League.
