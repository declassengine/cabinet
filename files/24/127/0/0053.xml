The danger spot is the unemployed.Yesterday there was another rather serious riot in Sheffield, which is believed to have been organised by tho revolutionary agitators who are knovm to be there *Though there is evidence of a reaction against Communists, as shown by a threat to exclude them from Working to^ Cinbs, the Communists are doing their best to incite the unemployed to violent action.Beginning three days hence, Communists will conduct a campaign to assist the Buss Ian famine and to prove to working men that the present state of Russia is not due to Communism,The delegates who have returned from the Third International Congress in Moscow are divided in their opinion of the Soviet regime.   Some are asking public speeches in its favour, while others are frankly disillusioned.   Tom Barm appears to be the only delegate who made much impression.As was to be expected, the unemployed are becoming more restive now that there has been a temporary check in the fall of the oast of living and no increase in. the dole.   Some of the men are undoubtedly suffering and it Is surprising how unresponsive the^ have been until now to the incitements of agitators.   This quiescence can scarcely be maintained through the vinter.The eight months9 strike of shipyard joiners terminated to-day.There are slight indications of an improvement in trade aOi a few of the blast fomacos and rolling mills are re-opening.Mr./
mm    jj     t-iMr* Robert Williams is reported to have made a very violsnt speech in Vienna,. .The Irish rebels in England aro quiescent.There is dismay araowg the moderates in Ireland at the reply of do V&amp;lora to the Prime Minister.
 BOB COMRTgrSTSThe Communist Party Is now ready for its caapai(nin connection with the Russian famine.   A special, &quot;Russian Workers1 Week&quot; has been arranged from august  1st - August  8th, with a two-fold object -&quot;Firstly to assist in organising all possible materialaid for those dying frorn hunger;   secondly- to eombsfcwith all our strength the vicious lies being circulatedonco again, about Soviet Russia and to explain toBritish workers tho truth about the famine,,&quot;   Acoor&amp;lngto them the truth is that:&quot;Owing to the abnormal drought, the like of which has not occurred for thirty y aars, ten provinces of Soviet Russia are in the grip of ever intensifying famine conditions.   This calamity, occurring before tha economic life of Soviet &quot;Russia has been able to recover from the disastrous effects of seven, years imperialistic and civil war, not only imperils the lives of from tea to twenty million proletarians but also gives to bourgeois and anti-cotmiUiiism forces a further opportunity for their efforts to ferment oountex*-r evolution and bring, about the downfall of the Russian Workers1 Soviet Republic.&quot;The Sxecutive declared It to be the paramount duty of all communists to do their utmost &quot;in defending, aiding and supporting the belaagured citadel of world communism,&quot;Special material for speakers is now being prepared and branches have been instructed to arrange tho maximum of meetings possible, to take special collections in aid of the famine areas at each meeting and to do all possible to &quot;awaken the British workers to the realities of the situation.&quot;The Executive Committee of the Third Internationa&apos; in Moscow has called upon the World Communist Movement to organise a special &quot;RED Week&quot; of communist agitation and propaganda during the period September7th/
7th - September 15th;    In response to this appeal theCommunist Part;,&apos; of Great Britain has resolved to make of thisweelc &quot;the greatest organising effort ever attempted in thiscountry.;&apos;&apos;     The following- instructions ha.re been issued totho divisional organisers:nYou are asked first of all to make arrangements for the maximum number of meetings and demonstrations to be held in every town in your division.     All speakers on your list should be asked to cancel any arrangements they maj have made for the week, and to place themselves unreservedly at your disposal for the purpose of addressing meetings every evening.&quot;A special number of the &apos;Co*^:unist1 will be issued as also will leaflets suitable for the occasion; where branches have banners, they should be called upon to have them in readiness and other branches should be asked to make an effort to prepare banners.&quot;Ail avenues of publicity should be made use of and any suggestions you may be able to make to this end will be welcome,,&quot;The Aberdeen branch is none top,, suite of the success of the &quot;Eussiaa famine Wae3c%     &quot;I &amp;on&apos;t know&quot;, writes the secretary, &quot;that we. shall bo able to do much owing to the big outlay in taking a speaker hore*,s     Our collections on Sunday with the McLoushlin opposition were 3/6 rooming and 12/l night;   we had sis dosen communists left.&quot;The Executive Committee has decided that when branch meetings are addressed 0.7 p-.dd organisers and propagandists, 50$ of the collections, after hospitality charges have been met shall be retained by the branch and 50$ be forwarded to headquarters *     ICllmamock branch is up in arms against this decision and the secretary has written on behalf of the members to ask the Scottish organiser if the &quot;Executive Committee is prepared to shoulder the loss in the event of any meeting beiri a failure, or if it ia to be a case of sHeads I win, tails you lose,,,&apos;    It is our opinion that- the Executive Comittee   I has no right to force this far reaching decision upon us in    j such an arbitrary manner.jThe/ I
The Executive reports that during&apos; the holiday oe&amp;son the salea of the &quot;Cp.r,.r.unist&quot; have mot with a &quot;slight set-back&quot;. Salea in tho Northern industrial centres h ve fa-lien off and the lack of support for the paper is regarded as scandalous. Branches have been instructed to form small committees to push the paper *   A specimen copy with a covering lotter giving terms is to be sent to every trade union branch, political labour group, adult school and co-operative society;    these copies will be supplied to the branches free of charge if a guarantee is given that they will only.be used for this purpose,muobers for free distribution may be had on application to&apos;headquarters.A ne?; printing machine has been purchased and it is thought that it v;i 11 how be -possible to go to Press on Tuesdays as before the raid an coanuaist. h-e&amp;d-mVitrters.     T&apos;.e paper used for the &quot;ConEiunis-t&quot; -was previously -mr. chased through the &quot;Drily Herald% but at their suggestion this arrangement has cease-: and the communists now deal direct with the paper merchants.The &apos;&apos;Comaiuaist&quot; &quot;receives regularly different papers and periodicals from Scandinavian countries,-BeXatua, France, Spain. I frilly, Balkan countries, Austria, Cr^cho-SV/geddrs./Aia, Gcr/aury, Russia, Latvia, Switzerland, India,, Japan,, Australia, Canada, United States, and South Africa,,     It is hoped to augment the number of papers received so that their present small library may develop into a &quot;joou international library and international research department.&quot;At the executive meeting;, which was held - at 16, KingStreet, on August 12th, the following report by Ton Clark,the acting organising secretary, was read:&quot;Since the last report submitted to the full Executive Coijmittee &quot;the&quot; following changes have been made.     Owing to the Cs.orphilly election I have   nad to withdraw Comrade Brown from the --north Er^-to Division to place him in South Vf-les to be the election agent for Coinrade Bob Stswart&apos;a candidature in Caurphilly, and I have placed Comrade Wheeler, executive councilman for tho Bert?.

propaganda of that Pi vision until the election is oveiji I have also placed Comrade Shillito at the services of i Comrade Bbury, the Yorkshire Divisional organiser, for the period of four woeks, to help to consolidate the forces in that division during the reaction as the resiii of the defeat of the industrial policy of the miners ari others,     I am placing the services of Comrade William Gee at tho disposal Of Comrade Crossley, the Lancashire divisional organiser, for the month of :.ugust*     Coiarait Gee has reported to the office that he is now able to&apos;dt his full quota of meetings *     As regards the Midlands, organisation seems to be somewhat at a standstill in that divd.si.on, therefore I have placed Comrade Webb at the disposal of Comrade J, Stewart, for tho period o: four weeks.     South Wales will be having the services o: Comrade Crawfurd for four weeks.     1 have instructed the divisional organiser, Coarse 1&apos;ilson, to use jComrade Crawford for the first fortnight of August&quot;to i speak for branches outside the Caerphilly division, andl to have Comrade Crawford at the services of the eleotioil committee in the Caerphilly division for the last       i fortnight in Augusts 1.&quot;As regards the general position of South ;&quot;alea, i there so ems to be for the first time a movement being 1 built up that will consolidate the revolutionary forces! in South Wales in a manner which has never hitherto bel equalled.     Thero are certain things which may have the effect of a temporary sot back in the organisation tlistl vie have at present in Waless that is, the victimisation! that is taking plaoe as the result of the defeat of thel miners.,    As far as I can gather from reports there mm not  5$ of the active members of the Communist Party i who have been allowed to return to the coal snineq.   Ihil is a new phase for South Wales or for any other mining! centre.&apos;    Hitherto, either during the period of defeat! victory, all in a coalfield area either return to work i or were all idle, but the policy which the master      i miners have adopted f and the Union has no power to   i alter meantime) the policy of taking on a certain sects for full employment and leaving another section idle,!* given the rhino owner, not only in South Vales, but is a coalfields, the opportunity of victimising the rebel i elements.     Although the policy of the master class ill well known and \\fell understood by the active Shop &apos;   I Stewards In the engineering and kindred industries, i&apos;l a new phase as far as the   industrial life of the rrdtfl Is concerned.     It may have the immediate effect of i perhaps temporarily disorganising our branches An tWB mining industry, but to mr mind it will eventually lefl and develop a clearer minded rebel than we have hitbwW had in the&quot; coalfields,     It will take them away frofl i their outlook on coal and nothing elge but coal... &quot; iOn August 14th Herald League speakers at Norwood wer*Hheckled by members of the People&apos;s League, who had just maseting in the same neighbourhood.    y&apos;-;:hen one speaker sai^b^that all the necessaries of life were supplied to the Pe0?:R

Herbert Smith, acting- president, took the chair, and dealt openly with the mistakes in policy that had been made by the federation. The war, he said, had left Its influence upon the minds of owners and workmen in the mining industry, and the ease with which miners obtained their demands during the war gave thorn a sense of power which was not altogether healthy,   The- first great test came in October 1920, whoa the miners fought for two and a half weeks and had. to accept a compromise.   The tactics of the leaders of the Federation in   March were, In his opinion, wrong.   They should have coneentratod on. wages, dropped the pool, and not withdrawn the safety men. Tfroir policy lost them public sympathy and caused resentment in the Triple Alliance, which weakened when the minors asked then to strike for something v-hich they themselves. had not obtained.   Those who used the most inflamed language in their denunciation of the terras wero the ones who had long gives up their task of trying to stop the production, of out-crop coal.   I?or cant and humbug there had never been anything to equal it.   &quot;The lot of our people has,&quot; he said, &quot;been hard.   It remains hard.

i 4M w r1Frank Hodges gave a report of the Executive on the 1Ibreakdown of the Triple Alliance-^and said that the TriplJ Alliance would never be effective until they all three 1 were challenged at the same time. He anticipated, of I course, that Capitalism would be too astute to attack all at the same timeuThe discussion of the report was then taken in pri-vf On August 12th the annual conference of the national Union of Scottish Erie Workers was held at Edinburgh andl was addressed by Mr, Robert S/vdllie.. Referring to the I recent stoppage as a glorious struggle he congratulated miners on their great fight and said that never in the history of industry In any country had they witnessed an i attempt to force such impertinent terms upon the working! class. The proposals posted at the pit heads showed an! amount of vindictiveness on the part of the? mineowners 1 unequalled in the history of the industry.     The struggl. - - - -  &apos;- -    &apos; i     - . !was engineered by comparatively few who, through;vindictivenessv wished to get some of their o^ts back.   Bsincerely hoped that there would be no feeling In any paof the- British coalfield that the miners had been defeatlThe agreement could be made bad or good according to the ability as organised workers to enforce It.   For a period;they might have dull trade in the mining industry.   Hawould almost see all the miners1 wives and children passaway rather than the men should go through the hell, thatthe miners went through after the Franco-Prussian War.They could prevent that, however.   It would only bedistrust and disorganisation that could make a repetitioiof those times possible.   Ho did not think that the presisettlementj or, indeed, probably any settlement under present conditions, could justify them in thinking theyhau &quot;fought thor-.- last fight.    He hoped they would be suffiently strong in their organisation to secure thatthey would not bo required to fight any more, but the-?should/
should bet in a position to fight should fighting bo jjeceasary.   They v/ere practically beginning to Improve the conditions of the miners*   He was convinced that the next 10 years would make far greater changes for the better in the lives of the workers in general than the last 50 years had shown.On August 15th the chairman refused to acknowledge the right of the three active communists. Bird, Kirker and Lamb, to represent the Fife Miners&apos; Union at this conference and asked them to withdraw from the meeting*   They declined and -the meeting was adjourned.It a delegate conference of South Wales colliery enginemen and surface craftsmen, held at Cardiff on Angust 10th, It was decided to break, away from the South Wales Miners8 Federation, and to reconstitute the South Wales Colliery 2&amp;sginemenJs, Stokers1 and Surface Craftsmen8$ Association.On August 16th a mass meeting of miners at Blaen&amp;von (Mon.) decided by a large majority to rescind the resolution by which thoir branch of the Miners1 federation became affiliated with the Labour Party, and to demand that in future th^efforts and funds of tho organisation shall be devoted purely to industrial matters*Some of the miners&quot; clubs in South Wales are threatening with expulsion members with Bolshevist sympathies.   One club in the Rhondda valley, composed of 600 members, mainly miners and other workmen, has poste&amp;\ this notice;-   &quot;Any member found upholding Bolshevism in any way, on or off the premises, will render himself liable to expulsion from the club..&quot;   In the Mid-Rhondda, a club has threatened that any of its members who show Bolshevist sympathies will be &quot;thrown out.&quot;In mining areas there is still dissatisfaction atthe/
the decision to withhold unemployment benefit from the miners who hare been unable to resume work.At a special meeting of the. council of the Leicestershi Miners1 Association last week, it was decided to increase the pey to out-of-work. members who had not started wo ask since the strike to;  2 per week for full members&apos;,  1 per week for hal  -combers, 2s. 6du per week for&quot;each ohild under 14 years of age,,   these increases to be re-considered in a month&apos;8 time.Many thousands of miners in Lancashire and Cheshire are only working three and a half or four days a week owing to the bad condition of the pits and the slack&apos;market for the increased output of coal which &quot;is still a prohibitive price,Tha Lanarkshire miners Union Is reported to be over  20,0-CQ ill debt.Tm uiTEtTPLoriin)In spite of the reported decrease in unemployment in Ikradon, meetings and processions of men out of work continue to take place dally and distress is prevalent.^ Hints are made - that grave events may bo lacked for during the coning winter.

receive Hanson&apos;s deputation of unemployed who were told that they must put their demands in writing.The deputation Which visited the Wandsworth Board of Guasfdians on the same day demanded that all relief should be given in cash instead of partly in kind.   If work could not be provided the unemployed wanted something like a &quot;decent&quot; scale of maintenance, which they declared they were not receiving at present.   They were not satisfied with the treatment hitherto aocorded them. Before they proceeded to unconstitutional action, however, thoy would give constitutional action its full scope.   Complaint was made that admission!to the workhouse had been denied - &quot;the last resource of every British citizen.&quot;   Relief in kind was said to have led to bribery and to- excessive charges for goods.   When the deputation had stated their case it was discovered that several members of the Board had left, and that not sufficient remained to form a quorum for the revision of the scale of relief.   To meet the situation it was resolved to adjourn the meeting.Owing to the large number of discharges there is unrest amongst the employees at the Royal Arsenal and Dockyard, Woolwich. .On August 12th a serious disturbance by unemployed and communists took place in Sheffield, when a procession of about 2,000 persons made their way to the Town Hall to protest against the refusal of the Guardians to pay. out-relief to single men.   While a deputation was being interviewed by the Deputy Town Clerk and members of the Guardians speeches were made outside the Town Hall to the crowd, which had increased to about 6,000 persons.   All vehicular traffic was stopped for the whole afternoon. Alphonse Wilson, a local communist agitator, advised hie &quot;fellow workers&quot; to stand their ground and if any attempt
was made to- remove-them-ho. threatened -that they-would smash every window In the Town Hall; If the Police used violence towards them thoy were to stand where they were and use thei! force as they were not going away until they got what they wanted*Shortly &amp;t*mm&amp;&amp;8jitter tho deputation had givea their report to the demonstrators, the crowd was dispersed, part cl them going in tho direction of High Street, where two window in the front door of a newspaper office were broken.

The main body of riOteraj was broken up and there ware several spasmodic outbursts in various parts of tho city.   At a demonstration in Pitaelan Square, one of the leaders appealed to the police to th^ow down their truncheons and have done with the Job.   This msn was arrested.   Another riot took place on a piece of spare ground in Bow Street.   In Bridge Street, close to the Communist headquarters, there was a baton charge after the police had been 3toned by the rioters and. here more arrests were made.   Further outbreaks took place later in the afternoon and there wore ^ore arrests.   In the neighbourhooof/\

Two thousand men were formerly employed here: since last October only about 14 days have been worked at the mills.The ship joiners1 strides     has      played   havoc with the ship-repairing industry in the Horsey district and on August 13th the &quot;Kaisorin Au;;uste Victoria&quot; loft Canada Dock for a continental port to have repairs completed.At Barrow trade all round is very bad and thousands are unemployed,In the Coventry area where the situation has changedlittle since last week ay correspondent reports that theunemployed are becoming restless on account of the stoppage of unemployment benefit.On August 13th several hundred unemployed, following aat Cowosconference v/ith the local Guardians, made formal application/ for Poor Law relief.   Throe relieving officers were engaged taking particulars of the applicants, whose oases will be considered.   Special police were on duty, but good order prevailed.   Duo nainly to slackness in the shipbuilding yardsthere/
m*  3.6  **there are about fifteen hundred out of work, including nearly four hundred ex-Service men.   Efforts made by the Isle of Wight Employment Committee to obtain Admiralty orders for Cov/es firms have so far proved unavailing.mckjsrs,Yarrow &amp; Company Limited have decided to close down their works at Scotstown, Glasgow, at the end of November, owing to the cost of shipbuilding which they say has become excessive owing to repeated strikes, reduction of output and demarcation disputes which have taken place in various industries throughout the county.One satisfactory feature in the depressing industrial situation on the Clyde is that Singers1 Factory at Kilbovri re-opened o$ August 15th;   several thousands of employeea havo started work after two months of enforced idleness. Some slight improvement is also noticeable in other industries,   but the return to anything approaching normal is disappointingly slow.   Shipyards are working on slow time, orders frequently being held up owing to the joiners strike,Tho prolonged trade stagnation is made a fruitful fi for propaganda by revolutionaries in this area.   The position of men who have been out of work for lengthy -periods Is distressing and the greatest difficulty is experienced by them in keeping a roof over their heads. Eumbers of these men have never been in such a plight before.From all over the country como reports of discontent caused by tho high cost of living.   The workers claim that they have consented to reductions in wages in order that prices may be reduced and. that It is now the duty of employers to reduce their standard of profit.ROBERT WII-L?; gSAlthough Williams was expelled from the Communistlarty/
257Party for his Inaction during the miners&apos; strike his speech at a meeting of railwaymen and transport workers in Vienna on August 12th, as reported in the &quot;Dally Herald&quot; of August 13ths was as extreme as any of his previous utterances as will he seen from the following extract from that paper:&quot;He (Williams) expressed the hope that British workers vri.ll drive monarchy, out of Britain as the Austrian proletariat had swept the Hap sburgs from power. ,Be uttered his conviction, moreover, that the British toilers will go their Austrian comrades one better and establish a Socialist Republic.&quot;Loud bravos followed Williams&apos; description of the Russian proletariat as the pioneers of revolution. The London and Paris imperialists, he declared, had been checkmated by the British workers and prevented from realising their interventionist policy for the overthrow of the Soviet Government.!T.SIKN, PSIP. gj GREAT. britain during the week meetings of the Irish Self-Determination League have been held in Londoru  and the provinces.    On August 9th Councillor Pureell, London organiser, spoke at a meeting of the Walworth branch; he said &quot;that the change in the attitude of llr. Lloyd George was brought about by the Irish Republican Army backed by determined Irishmen and women. Hope exists in Ireland as well as bate, tne latter due to ^phs fell known deceit and hypocrisy of tne British Government and of that unprincipled scoundrel Lloyd George.    The next war would be on an international basis and it behoved all Irishmen end women to get ready as in Ireland preparations were being mads for the continuance of the struggle.   He was not a pessimist but saw nothing to be optimistic about.   No elaborated scheme of Home Rule would answer; it may make an improvement but not a permanent settlement.    Absolute   freedom and independence alone would satisfy the Irish.There are indications from more than one source that armsare much in demand for use in Ireland.    It is reported that a young man who is stated to be well supplied with money has arrived/
arrived in London in connection with this work.    Sinn Seiners are also said to he endeavouring to purchase arms from young soldiors at Maryhill Barracks, Glasgow.In the Manchester and Liverpool area and in the North of England generally there is a lull in Irish political activity; the Irish there are awaiting a lead from Ireland.ireland there is no change in the situation.    The reply by De Valora to the Prime Minister and his speech at the opening of the Dail Sireann have depressed the Moderates and show -that the extremists are very powerful,   particularly in the South where they talk of a fight to the finish and a Republic or nothing. &apos; The position of Ulster is a sore point to Dail Eireann, and there is a real fear that if Ulster does not come into a united Ireland it will be impossible to &quot;carry on&quot;.    In the meantime preparations to keep the Irish Republican Army in good condition for war continue, and there seems no doubt that an impetus to the smuggling of arms and ammunition has been given owing to the idea that the authorities are not troubling to sear eh ships and persons during the armistice.
