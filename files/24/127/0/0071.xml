W.-E.The War Office,29th August, 1921.A list of the 29 British prisoners believed to be in the hands of the Turks is given in Appendix A.A list of 64 Turkish prisoners whom His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to release is given in Appendix B.A list of all Turkish prisoners showing those for release and those for trial, together with the charges against those who were in Malta on 9.5.21, is shown at Appendix C.. i On 16,3.21, an agreement was signed between His Majesty&apos;s Government and Bekir Sami, who represented the Turkish Nationalists, as-to the exchange of prisoners of war.   The full text of this agreement is given in Appendix D.By this Agreement the Turks were immediately to release all British prisoners held by them against their will and to convey them to Constantinople. His Majesty&apos;s Government would commence at once, and continue as quickly as possible, to repatriate .all Turkish prisoners of war, and interned civilians except those whom it was intended to try for alleged offences in violation of the laws and customs of war, or for massacres committed during the continuance of the state of war in the Turkish Empire as constituted on 1.8.14.His Majest.y&apos;s Government made it a condition of the release of any particular individuals that they should not visit Constantinople before the restoration of peace under penalty of arrest..Bekir Sami, having asked that the Turks to be released from Malta might be sent F.O.to Italy, arrangements were made accordingly.    , . letter No.3&apos; s 0 3 v E. 3375/132/44, dated 23.3.21.In order to show their good faith, Flis Majesty&apos;s Government, on 24.3.21, directed W.O. that 25 of the 64 Turks should be despatched forthwith, so as to meet the Turkish ^Z^695&apos; Delegation in Rome.   The remainder of the Turks were to be despatched in, small p&quot;^ dated batches as British prisoners were received. 24.3.21.On the same day, 24.3.21, the Commander-in-Chief, Constantinople, wired to the C-in-C, ^ War Office and to Malta saying that he trusted that until the prisoners were safely on Cons,anti-board a British warship, no Turk would be allowed to leave Malta.&apos; The Commander-88, in-Chief&apos;s objection to the immediate release of the Turks was based on his opinion that dated the Nationalists would not honour Bekir Sami&apos;s signature.    In consequence of this the 24.3.21.(BJ1/230)   70   8/21   H&amp;S, Ltd   942Uvo
P.O.to Rome, No. 110, dated 2.4.21.P.O.to Rome, No. 118 (R.), dated 6.4.21.High Oom-missioner, Oonstanti-nople, No. 245, dated 6.4.21.High Com-. missioner, vOonstanti-nople, No. 270,-dated 15.4.21.Commander-in-Chief, Malta, requested further instructions before actually despatching the Turks.On 2.4.21 the Foreign Office, in view of the above representations from Constantinople, and in reply to a protest from Bekir Sami regarding the non-delivery of the first batch of Turkish prisoners, instructed the British Ambassador in Rome to inform Bekir Sami that whenever his Government delivered a British prisoner into safe hands in any Turkish port, three Turkish prisoners would be delivered at the same port with the least possible delay. Bekir Sami took strong objection to this alteration of the original agreement.On 6.4.21, accordingly, the Foreign Office, through Rome, suggested to Bekir. Sami that, on the delivery of the 22 British prisoners at Constantinople or at a Black Sea port, His Majesty&apos;s Government would deliver the 64 Turks either at an Italian or Turkish port.On the same date, the British High Commissioner at Constantinople reported that there were no signs of the Angora Government having accepted the agreement as to the exchange of prisoners. He warned the Foreign Office that as a consequence of the Greek reverse, outbursts of chauvinism might be expected, which might take the form of demands for the release of all the Turks detained at Malta, including those accused of crimes.The British High Commissioner in Constantinople, in concurrence with the Commander-in-Chief there, proposed on 6.4.21 that 40 Turks should immediately be sent from Malta to Italy, and that Bekir Sami should be asked what arrangements had been made for sending the British prisoners to a port on the Black Sea. The remainder of the Turks could be released when the British prisoners were safe.The Army Council, on 12.4.21, agreed to this, and the Foreign Office wired to the British Ambassador at Rome to acquaint Bekir Sami with this proposal.On 13.4.21, the Commander-in-Chief, Malta, was directed by the War Office to carry out the despatch of the 40 Turks to Italy at once.On 14.4.21, the British High Commissioner at Constantinople informed Bekir Sami, who was then at Constantinople, of the proposal mentioned above, he having left Rome before the arrival of the Foreign Office wire.Bekir Sami in reply acknowledged the receipt of the British High Commissioners communication, and stated that on arrival at Angora he would immediately cause the British prisoners to be sent to Constantinople.On 20.4.21, the Commander-in-Chief, Constantinople, again expressed his scepticism of Bekir Sami&apos;s promises, as he considered that Bekir Sand did not carry as much weight at Angora as formerly.The release of prisoners was, however, carried out as follows : 4 Turkish prisoners were released on 29.4.21, and proceeded to Sicily under their own arrangements. 33&apos; more were released on 30.4.21 and sent in British men-of-war to Taranto. In addition 3 had been already released on 24.3.21 under special authority.On 17.5.21, the British High Commissioner at Constantinople reported that he had heard that( Bekir Sami had resigned. He further stated that some days previously he had wired to Bekir Sami asking him what steps he was taking to execute the agreement for the exchange of prisoners, but that he had had no reply.On 22.5.21, the High Commissioner further reported that 21 of the Turks from Malta had arrived at Constantinople on 19.5.21, but that in concurrence with the Commander-in-Chief, he had. decided that no good would come of re-arresting them. He had, however, made a public statement emphasising the good faith of His Majesty&apos;s Government as opposed to the bad faith of the Angora Government in this matter.On 29.5.21, the British High Commissioner at Constantinople wired that&quot; the Angora Telegraph Agency had announced that Mustafa Saghir, a British Indian, had been executed three days before as a spy by the Nationalists.On 12.5.21, the.High Commissioner had telegraphed to Bekir Sami claiming the surrender of this man under the Exchange Agreement.On 5.6.21, the High Commissioner further reported that the Angora Government had wired to him on 4.6.21 saying that Mustafa Saghir was not entitled to the benefit of exchange because he went voluntarily to Angora, aud had been proved to be a spy. The High Commissioner refuted this argument, and protested against the Turkish action.On 3.6.31, Mr. Cecil Harmsworth, answering a question in the House of Commons, is reported to have stated that the British prisoners were still detained by the Turks, and that, pending their release, the remaining 24 Turks would be detained in Malta.
379On 9.6.21, the British High Commissioner at Constantinople received a message from Fevzi Pasha, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs at Angora, stating in reply to the High Commissioners wire on 14.5.21, that a first batch of 10 British prisoners would be despatched to Adalia, and Trebizond, and that other British prisoners would be evacuated as the remainder of the Turks at Malta were released.The High Commissioner replied pointing out that this was not in accordance with the agreement, and invited the Angora authorities to proceed -without further delay with the release of all British subjects detained in Anatolia. The High Commissioner considered that Fevzi&apos;s message was thoroughly unsatisfactory, as the British prisoners would still be under the Nationalists&apos; control at Adalia and Trebizond, and &quot; the remainder of the Turks at Malta &quot; might include those accused of crimes.On 11.6.21, the Commander-in-Chief, Constantinople, pressed his proposal that the British prisoners be collected at a Black Sea port on a British warship, which should sail from there simultaneously with the sailing of the balance of the Turkish prisoners from Malta.The Army Council modified this proposal so that the Turks might be sent to an W.O. letter Anatolian port on a British warship, and the exchange be effected there, on that w-ar- No. 0103/shiP- ^ fSK),dated-   &apos; - 15.6.21.On 11.6.21, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Constantinople Turkish Govern- High Oom-ment called on the British High Commissioner and, on behalf of the Turkish Nationalists, Q^^nti suggested that the whole of the Malta prisoners should be released.   Those accused of nopie, crimes would be put on impartial trial at Angora in the same way as German prisoners No. 419, were being; tried in Germany. datedOu 14.6.21, the Nationalist papers published an announcement that all the British    &apos;  &quot;   &apos; prisoners were to be liberated.On 17.6.21, the British High Commissioner at Constantinople reported that he had learned from a fairly reliable source that the Bolshevists had protested vigorously to Angora against the release of the British prisoners, as being contrary to the Soviet-. Kemalist Agreement.On 19.6.21, the British High Commissioner at Constantinople suggested a form of delivery against delivery for the exchange of prisoners on the following lines, namely : Turks from Malta wishing to go to Anatolia should be sent to&apos; Adalia by ship ; British prisoners should be collected at Adalia and Trebizond, those at Adalia being delivered on board the ship bringing the Turks. Those Turks who did not wish to go to Anatolia from Malta should be sent to Italy as soon as the British at Trebizond had been , embarked on an Allied ship.The British High Commissioner also suggested that it should be made quite clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not intend to release any Turks other than those specified in the agreement with Bekir Sami, and that all British subjects in Anatolia who wished to come away must be allowed to do so.On 20.6.21, the Commander-in-Chief, Constantinople, reported that he had received, through a Major Henry, a message from Mustafa Kemal that the British prisoners were quite well, that he, Mustafa Kemal, was willing to release them all, and that 10 were already on their way.On. 22.6.21, the Foreige Office instructed the British  High Commissioner at p.o. to Constantinople to take delivery of the 10. British prisoners, but stated that they Constanti-could not release another Turk until all&apos;the British prisoners were.returned. No^sWOn 25.6.21, the British High Commissioner at Constantinople received a message dated   &apos; from the new Government at Angora.   This message, after repudiating Bekir Sami&apos;s 22.6.21. agreement, stated that the Angora Government were in principle ready to surrender all British prisoners in return for the surrender of all Turkish prisoners and detained persons.On 26.6.21, Bekir Sami, who had returned to Borne, complained to the British Ambassador there, that of the 40 Turks who had been released, not one was a Nationalist. .   -On 3.7.21, the British High Commissioner at Constantinople, reported that eight British prisoners had arrived at Constantinople, and that one of them was accompanied by his wife and two children.On 5.7.21, General Headquarters, Constantinople, reported that, another prisoner from Anatolia had arrived at Constantinople. Of the above nine prisoners only five were British, and of these one was only technically British ; of the remaining four one was a civilian batman, and three were interpreters.(9421) a 2
On 8.7.21, the British High Commissioner at Constantinople, sent a summary of the Angora Governments reply to the Aga TChan&apos;s message on the subject of the exchange of prisoners.   In this reply the Angora Government stated that it had repudiated Bekir Sami&apos;s agreement   because it deprived that   Government of  all opportunity for safe-guarding the lives and interests of its remaining prisoners of war, but that it was ready to exchange all British prisoners as against all Turkish prisoners. Hariugton,        On 30.7.21, the Commander-in-Chief, Constantinople, wired to the War Office No. 688,    asking for authority to try to obtain the release of the British prisoners from Mustafa 30 7 21     Kemal.   General Harington stated that he was firmly convinced that he &apos;had a better chance of succeeding than anyone else.This request was referred to the Foreign Office on 3.8.21 and the reply is still awaited.The situation at the present moment is that His Majesty&apos;s Government holds at Malta 24. of the 64 Turkish prisoners who were to have been released under the agreement made with Bekir Sami. In addition they hold 54 Turks whom it is proposed to try for various crimes.On the other hand, of the 29 British prisoners believed to have been in the hands of the Turks, only five have been released, and there are probably more British subjects detained in Anatolia than the remaining 24 enumerated- in the list given to the Angora Government.4th August, 1921.APPENDIX A.ANNEX 1 TO APPENDIX D.List of persons who are known to Llis Majesty&apos;s Government as being held in Turkey against their will, and are to be released under Article 1.
