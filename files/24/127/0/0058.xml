SUMMARY.GENERAL,The impression that Communism and the power of the Third Inter-national are on the whole declining forces is strengthened by the events of the month under review. Tho Russian famine, the true proportions of which are known only to the Soviet, may starve that Government out of existence within a very few weeks. An examination of the evidence about the famine is given in Article 1, Part II. of this issue.PRANCE.The Congress of the Confederation Generate du Travail resulted in a decision by a narrow majority to adhere to the Amsterdam International. The Communist section is organising an inner body which will seek to permeate the Confederation with its own revolutionary views.The Communist campaign continues with unabated violence.BELGIUM.It is understood that steps will be taken for the amalgamation of the two existing Communist Parties. Jacquemotte has been promised financial support&apos;by Moscow providing the two groups combine.ITALY.. Peace between- the Fascisti and the Socialists was signed on August 3rd.The Congress of the Third International considered the position of the Italian Socialist Party and decided that the Reformists must be expelled from the Party as a condition precedent of adhesion to the International.SPAIN.Disorders continue in all parts of Spain, but some of the crimes recorded are probably of personal and not of political origin.NORWAY.The failure of the general strike has been followed by some signs 6i a revolt against the Extremists. The Policy of the Norwegian Labour Party appears to be directed towards the preparation of future struggles:SWEDEN.The proved complicity of Kerjentseff in the lately discovered Bolshevik plot has decided the Swedish authorities to request his with-drawal. The discoveries so far made indicate that the plot is more extensive and complicated than was originally supposed.DENMARK.The Danish Communists have schemes on foot to induce Danish workmen to go to Russia for tasks of reconstruction.GERMANY.The United Communist Party has agreed to the proposal made by ZinoviefF at the Third International that the WofkmenV Communista 2
Party be given three months to call a party congress. If the Workmen&apos;s Party then decides to submit to the Third International it may be allowed to combine with the United Communists, otherwise the Execu-tive Committee of the Third International may exclude the Workwen&apos;s Party from the International. Communism in Germany generally is declining and disorganised.It is reported that there is some danger of the movement in Upper Silesia assuming a Communist aspect.SWITZERLAND.Helped by the present industrial depression and the forced reduction of wages the Communists appear to be gaining ground. They are prepaiing a new campaign against the lowering of wages.AUSTRIA.The Communist penetration of the Trades Unions continues. Com-munist policy aims at provoking revolt, and strikes, leading possibly to a general strike.RUSSIA.The policy decided upon by the Third International for the forth-coming year appears to be one of more or less peaceful construction. It has been made clear that the United Kingdom is the enemy to be overthrown.The decision arrived at by the Red Trade Union International to establish close contact with tho Third International makes the first-named body the organ of the Communist International, working by similar means to similar ends.The various reports of an impending offensive by the Red Army are denied.The Soviet is said to intend to start its experiments in reconstruction by reviving the industry of Petrograd.FINLAND.The members of the Finnish Trade Delegation to Moscow have advised Finnish industrialists to make no attempt to open up trade with Russia.LATVIA.The Soviet has presented a note to Latvia protesting against alleged unfriendly acts.POLAND.A very sharp note has been addressed to the Polish Government by Tchitcherin.   Warsaw has replied to this by counter charges.JUGOSLAVIA.The attempted assassination of the Prince Regent and the murder of the Minister of the Interior have moved the Government to pass drastic laws against disturbers of the State. It is understood that the dissolution-tiou of the Commuuist Party and the annulment of the mandate of the Communist deputies are provided for.
ROUMANIA.The Extremists are for the moment discredited and moderate elements are gaining influence.TURKEY.Relations between tho Bolsheviks and the Kemalists remain delicately balanced. The Soviet seems inclined to assist Enver Pasha, a policy which indicates the undermining of Kemal&apos;s influence.GEORGIA.The Eussification of the country is steadily proceeding. Hunger and misery are rampant.AFGHANISTAN.The Afghan Delegation are said to have received news that their negotiations with Moscow have resulted satisfactorily.CANADA.The Communists are exploiting the prevalent unemployment to their own ends. They are talking of a Dominion-wide organisation of unemployed.The One Big Union is gradually breaking up.SOUTH AFRICA.The Communist movement, though if is small in range, is reported to have reached a stage where it requires attention.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.The Labour situation is said to present perilous features, which may result in serious strifes when industry once more becomes normal.The Communists are working for the amalgamation of the various extremist bodies. If its schemes succeed the United Communist Party of America will influence about 2,500,000 workers.
CONFIDENTIAL.A Review of Revolutionary Movements in Foreign Countries.PART I.1. LATIN COUNTRIES. FRANCE.The Congress of the Confederation Generate du Travail.The Congress of the Confederation Generate du Travail at Lille is over and the appearance of unity has been narrowly preserved. In reality the fissure in the Confederation runs very deep, and may easily widen to an unfillable gap.The Congress opened in an atmosphere of strife and suspicion. The Confederation is rapidly declining in membership and influence ; the propaganda of extremists has resulted in the secession of some 1,500,000 members, and the total membership of affiliated unions is not more than 600,000. Fewer than 3,000 of the 4,000 affiliated unions were represented at Lihe.It had long been evident that the extremists would obey their masters by attempting to bring French trade unionists within the fold of Moscow, aud to make them reject Amsterdam. The attitude of the extremists, in fact, is one of full accord with Moscow principles, but of refusal of political directions from Moscow. They want the working classes to be free to choose the moment for revolutionary action, aud they want especially this action to be decisive and not exposed to the risk of defeat for the benefit of a political faction who would disown the workers&apos; rights on reaching power. Hence the refusal of the extremists to recognise the undertakings entered into at Moscow by Tommasi and the consequent, resignation of the latter. They see Syndicalists and Socialists freely, co-operating, each group preserving its own autonomy and both adhering to the Third International.. Thus the old pre-war dispute between Syndicalists and Socialists is revived. Moscow for its . part envisages the failure of the revolutionary movement if it does not hold the reins controlling the workers. The movement on the part of the C.om.muuist leaders was subtile. It aimed at.winning the waverers who are Communists at heart but who shrink from complete surrender to Moscow; it bore fruit at the Metal Workers&apos;Congress, which decided by a majority of one vote to adhere to Moscow. The Metal Workers have 400,000 members and aTe the most active, politically, of the workers&apos; federations. The preliminary propagandist campaign on the other side was very active.The general secretary of the Red Trade Union International played his part by sending a message urging the Conference, after repudiating the Amsterdam Internatioual, to join the Third International. It&apos; was claimed that the recent Congress at Moscow-&quot; never, intended to-lessen the autonomy of the trade union organisations of the different countries.&quot; The message was evidently of Parisian origin, and seems to have deluded very few people.
The first day&apos;s session of the Congress degenerated into a free fight between moderates and extremists. Monmousseau, one of the extremist leaders, rushed the platform, and a melee lasting three-quarters of an hour followed, in which revolver shots were fired and chairs used as missiles. One delegate received a bullet in his shoulder ; another had his ear shot off.   The meeting broke up amidst indescribable confusion.The card vote on the political report of the Confederation^ executive, which ranks as a vote of confidence, gave the Reformists 1,556 votes and the Revolutionists 1,348 a majority of 208 for the Reformists. Both sides expressed themselves contented. A great strife of words between the defenders of Moscow and Amsterdam followed, and died away in anticipation of the offensive between Jouliaux and Dumoulin on the one hand and Monatte and Monuiousseau on the other.The vote on the Moscow versus Amsterdam debate, taken after a stormy day, showed for present policy and Amsterdam, 1,572 ; for revolutionary policy and Moscow, 1,327. There were 66 abstensions. Monatte and Jouhaux wound up the debate on the future policy of the Confederation. Monatte affirmed that the dissidents would retain their revolutionary spirit whatever happened ; Jouhaux declared that the Confederation would remain in the Amsterdam International and outside of and independent of all political parties, basing its action on the traditional action of trade unionism in France, as expressed in the Charter of Amiens.After their defeat the Communists or Left Wing delegates held a kind of sub-congress of their own at which they decided to re-organise the Revolutionary Trades Union Committees, whose activity has led to the Reformist policy of expulsions. These committees will be organised on the same plan as the Confederation Generale du Travail itself by towns, departments and provinces. There will thus exist an imperium in imperio which will seek to permeate the Confederation Generale du Travail with its own revolutionary views. Should the Executive of the Confederation Generale du Travail act on the authority given it by the majority resolution at the Congress and exclude unions who submit to Moscow dictatorship the schism that has been temporarily averted will become inevitable.The Tommasi Incident.The Tommasi incident deserves separate notice. The delegates of the French Red Trade Unions went to Moscow charged -With adhering to the Third International! but with the reservation that such adhesion iu no way implied absolute obedience to the political orders of Moscow. But the International passed a resolution, accepted by Tommasi, that liaison between Red trade unionists and the Communist Party must be as close as possible. The result was a protest declaring that Tommasi and Godonneohe, who signed the resolution, exceeded their mandate, and that the forthcoming Congress of the Confederation Generale du Travail would not require adhesion to Moscow. This was signed by all the extremist leaders. Repudiated by the Union des Syndicats de la Seine, Tommasi took the only course open to him, and resigned. Frossard, the apostle of Bolshevism in France, had already suspected that the Moscow resolution would disturb the party unity, and he was sharply attacked at Moscow.The Communist Campaign.There is no abatement of the venomous Communist campaign against the Government, and the attacks upon MM. Briand, Barthou and Bonnavey are especially virulent.   Radicals, Socialists and Communists
are bitter))&apos; contesting the efforts of the Governm6nt to pass a resolution against anti-militarist propaganda. Over 400 proposed amendments have been tabled, so thai; there can be no possibility of the Bill being voted upon or becoming law until the next parliamentary session. Communist propaganda is now taking the form of open air excursions, which have more success than pamphlets and newsjDaper articles. The vacation is scornfully left to &quot;bourgeois&quot; parties, and is to bring, not relief, but intensive propaganda, aimed, it is said, at initiating in September next a vast international revolutionary movement led by Moscow and assisted by the Amsterdam Communist Bureau. The Communists hope that financial embarrassments, unemployment and commercial difficulties will then have ripened revolutionary spirits. The Communist Party is being reorganised ; each of its sections, retaining a political form, is to become a military &quot; nucleus &quot; ready for marshalling its forces if occasion occurs. Demobilised Communists retain their military rank so that they may instruct their comrades. It is questionable whether a revolutionary outbreak would be supported by the Army. The demobilisation of the 1919 class has, in the nick of time, saved the 1920-1921 classes from contamination.The Communists are said to be earnestly considering the importance of feeding the population in the event of a revolution. They are forming committees in order to train a capable staff, and instructing their followers to study the working of the co-operative system.The Narrow Path.The 54 dissident Deputies of the United Socialist Party, led by Leon Blum, have failed to come to an understanding with the Com-munists led by Cachin and Frossard. The conditions imposed were too hard. Many of the dissidents, notably Blum and Seinbat, are capitalists, who, though they may toy with an academic socialism, shrink before the hard renunciations of Communism. Moscow required the submission of the whole Socialist Communist Federation of France, without exception, to the Third International, and also the submission of all the French leaders and parliamentary representatives of the Federation to the control of a commissary from Moscow, who would come to France when the French delegation to the Congress of the International returned. The dissidents have since sought an alliance with the Radical Socialists, whose political programme very much resembles their own. The Radicals have, however, postponed their decision, because the projected alliance would compromise their own position towards the Government.Soviet Agents in France.A number of persons who do not belong politically to the Bolshevik Party and who have no revolutionary antecedents have been used by the Soviet for some time past as clandestine commercial agents in Paris. Most of them are russian or Polish Jews; and they are often real or feigned refugees. One of these people is Boris Borel, undoubtedly one of the suppliers of military equipment to the Soviet. Borel formerly had a perfumery and pharmaceutical products business in Petrograd, and possessed a fairly large fortune. He has now bought a restaurant in Paris, which he wants to turn into a Russian restaurant, and he has numerous acquaintances among Russian Jews.Miscellaneous.Socialists and anti-militarists are furiously raging over the possible despatch of additional troops to Upper Silesia, &quot; L&apos;Humanite &quot; surpassing itself in violence.
The arrival has been reported at Havre of the Swedish steamship &quot; Marta &quot; with a cargo of 985,000,000 (currency not given) in gold. A later report lowered the amount to 9.000,000 crowns&apos; worth of gold (500,000/.).Sergieff, the delegate destined by Lenin to attend the Lille Congress, is said, along with a number of comrades, to have perished in an accident to the special train by which he was travelling.It is officially denied that negotiations have been opened between a representative of the French Government and Krassin with a view to inducing the Moscow Government to recognise the debts of the former Russian Empire.The Toulon police authorities are reported to have discovered a centre of Bolshevik propaganda among naval officers at that port, chiefly of the aviation service.   Several arrests have been made.According to newspaper reports the French Government is intervening as plaintiff in the English Courts in an action respecting the sale of a stock of wood by the Bolsheviks to a British firm. The wood, which came from Archangel, is stated to have been identified, before the date fixed for its delivery, by a French merchant as having beeu sold by him during the war.A committee called &quot; Les Amis de la Coree &quot; was established in Paris towards the end of June for defending Korean interests, Louis Marin, deputy of Meurthe-et-Moselle, was elected president. The activities of the committee are anti-Japanese ; one of its main objects is to get in touch with sympathisers with the Korean cause on the principle of assisting nations suffering under the unjust domination of other countries.BELGIUM.The Industrial Situation.There would appear to be little practical ground for the optimistic opinion, which is growing, that the industrial crisis has passed its worst point. The metallurgical industry, which showed signs of revival during the coal strike in Great Britain, is again becoming depressed, but there.is some improvement in the textile industry. The miners have received with satisfaction the decision of the National Mixed Commission on Mines to postpone the decrease of 5 per cent, in wages until August 1. The mechanical workers have accepted a diminution in wages of 10 per cent, for all workers over 21 years of age. It is considered, that the greatest post-war difficulties in tho Belgian labour situation have been overcome.Trade Union Congress. -The National Trades Union Commission (Commission Syndicale) held its annual congress at Brussels during July. The 300 delegates included the Communist Puree 11, representing Great Britain. Everling, one of the secretaries, who is a likely convert to Communism, said that the future programme of the Commission-was not clearly defined. He wanted more revolutionary activity, with the requisitioning of all raw materials as a first step a notion that was later approved by resolution, with the addition that the Government should follow up this measure by exercising a serious control over industries. eventually the Economic Council was charged with elaborating a draft law on the control of industries, to which the Labour Party is to be asked to stand parliamen--tary sponsor.    The representation of workers was asked for in the
Committee responsible for the preparation of the index figures. Jouhaux pleaded for joint trade union action by France and Belgium.The Communists : Moscow&apos;s Policy.There is little change in the position of the &quot;Confederation Com-munisfe Beige&quot; and the new &quot; Parti Communiste Beige.&quot; A Flemish edition of the &quot; Ouvrier Communiste,&quot; the organ of the Confederation, has been launched, but has been so feebly supported that a subscription has been opened in order to continue it. Massart, who had charge of the Parti Communiste during Jacquemotte&apos;s absence, stirred up a dispute with the Railwaymen&apos;s Union by publishing an article in the &quot; Exploite &quot; accusing the leaders of betraying the interests of the workers. The Union replied that far from betraying the workers it had upheld them by taking part in the boycotting of Hungary, by holding up munitions destined for Poland, &amp;c. The result has been that many members Lave protested against the revolutionary policy of the Union. A section of the men, indeed, proposes to form a neutral union on the lines of that formed by the Brussels tramway men, but no definite action has yet been taken.Jacquemotte and Van Overstraeten are now back from Moscow. The principal object of their journey was to obtain a ruling as to the status of the Communist movement in Belgium and the proposed amalgamation of the two Communist groups. As has been mentioned, the two men head different groups, Van Overstraeten the Communist group at Brussels and its offshoots ; Jacquemotte the lately formed &quot;Parti, Communiste Beige.&quot; The two have as yet made no official statement concerning their plans, but it is understood that Jacquemotte was well received in Moscow and promised financial support providing the two Communist groups combined. Moscow seems to have approved Jacquemotte&apos;s advocacy of Communist participation in Parliamentary elections, a course strongly opposed by Van Overstraeten. A committee of four members of each group, presided over by a representative of the Executive Committee of the Third International, is to be formed to draw up a programme for united action. Within two months a congress of all members will be called to discuss the decisions arrived at, aud the nomi-nation of parliamentary candidates will be arranged. The troublesome question of leadership is to be decided by a vote of the Congress.ITALY.Moscow and the Italian Communists.The Congress of the Third International had for one task to- &quot; rectify the position of its adherents in Italy. Moscow had great, hopes of its Italian followers last year, and saw in the occupation of- the factories a preliminary to the hoisting of the red flag over Montecitorio. These hopes were dashed by the strong action of the Government and by the backsliding of Serrati&apos;s group, which, after first accepting the 21 points and joining the International, bega&quot;n a campaign against this in &quot; Avanti.&quot; Hence Zinovieffs strictures on the lack of discipline in the party, and its failure to fulfil its tasks. The Italian representatives defended themselves vigorously, and levelled charges of treachery, notably against Smeral, the leader of the Czecho-Slovak Communists. Lazzari, of the Italian Socialist Party, tried to point out the services rendered by his followers to the Third International and to, justify their tactics. He declared that when the time came the Italian proletariat would be in a position to assert  its dictatorship.    Lazzari quoted
Frossard&apos;s words : &quot; Neither absolute submission nor absolute indepen-dence that is our formula,&quot; and added that those were precisely the conditions which they were charged with presenting to the International. An uproar followed, and Gennari rose and demanded that Lazzari&apos;s &quot; shameful&quot; proposal be declined and that the party be excluded from the Third International. The final result was a demand that the previous ultimatum requiring the expulsion of the reformists as a condition pre-cedent of adhesion to the International should be accepted. If this is done the Congress authorises the Executive Committee to take the necessary steps to allow the Italian Socialist Party to join the Third International on condition that the latter dismisses the reformist and centre elements. Lazzari surrendered, and promised that at the next Congress of his party everything possible would be done to have the decision of the Third International accepted.According to Bellisario Ciovagnoli, a well-known anarchist of the old school, a revolution is impossible in Italy. The people do not want it, and the extremists have not the courage to bring it about. The present extremist leaders ave more or less dishonest men, whose only aim is to get money, without troubling whether it comes from Russia or from the Italian Government. As for anarchism, the Italian anarchists are disorganised, and, like the Communists, very much fonder of talk than of action. The &quot;frivolous&quot; attitude of the Italian Communists has also been commented upon by Hungarian Communist immigrants. Politically the Italian Socialists have turned from revolution to evolution, and it is not unlikely that at their next National Congress in October they may consent to co-operation with the Government.The Internal Disorders.After protracted negotiations peace between the Fascisti and the Socialists was signed on August 3rd. The Communists refused to be a party to the agreement. It remains to be seen whether Fascisti and Communists will arrive at any common settlement. The events of the last month indicate a state of affairs hardly removed from civil war. The attack upon Mrs. Beckett&apos;s motor car at Viterbo, the death of one of her sons, and the wounding of herself and the rest of the party is only an incident. A new development has been the organisation of a body called &quot; Arditi del Popolo &quot; (or &quot; People&apos;s Storm Troops &quot;) on the same lines as the Fascisti. The conflicts which have occurred daily are reminiscent of the raids and battles of the Middle Ages, when hill town was armed against hill town. The Fascisti, who are reported on a con-servative estimate to be 187,000 strong, have become a force with which Governments must reckon. They have latterly attacked Catholics as * well as Socialists and Communists, and are rapidly becoming unpopular with the middle classes.Among the outstanding scenes of bloodshed was the conflict at Sarzana, in the province of Genoa, between Fascisti and carabinieri, in which Communists also joined. Tho Fascisti, who were entering the town upon a punitive expedition, were fired upon by the carabinieri, losing six killed. An attack by the Communists followed, and the total number of killed was, at a moderate estimate, 27. The total casualties are put at about 80.Following the murder of a Fascist, Grosseto, a small town in Tus-cany, was entered by 1,500 armed Fascisti, and 15 Communists were killed.Another terrible affair occurred at Roccastrada, near Grosseto, where Fascisti killed nine Communist peasants and burnt their houses, in revenge for an ambush of Fascisti.   The Chamber of Labour in Rome
ordered, as a result, a general strike for 24 hours throughout the provinces.Miscellaneous.The Prime Minister has announced in the Chamber that a trade agreement with Russia will be signed shortly.The trial of Malatesta, Borghi, and other extremists, on charges of plotting against the security of the State, has ended in acquittal.D&apos;Annunzio is reported not to have abandoned his interest in Flame and in the political situation in Italy. He is thought to be in a position to come back at any time, organise the Fascisti and to attempt a coup da main with their aid.Some figures from Turin give an indication of the serious crisis in Italiau industry. There are only 14,000 textile workers employed, as against 24,000 at the end of 1920, and of these about 11,000 work at most 20 hours a week. About 50 per cent, of the metal workers are employed ; most of the Communist workmen have been discharged. The Communists are credited with the intention of provoking riots at Turin. The General Labour Confederation has, however, decided that all persons employed in the public services shall in future be excluded from general strikes of a political character.Gavan Duffy is reported to be assiduously feeding the Rome Press with Sinn Fein news. His hold on the &quot; Corriere dTtalia,&quot; the organ of the Catholic or Popular Party, is so strong that the editor has promised not to publish articles derogatory to Sinn Fein.Jonathan Rabinovic, the Bolshevik leader for Liguria, has been arrested at Genoa. The arrest is important in that it will greatly disorganise Bolshevik communications. The main business of Rabinovio was the receiving and forwarding of correspondence by special couriers  he ran the courier service for the Bolsheviks between Italy, Odessa, the Crimea and Moscow.In an effort to frustrate the course of justice, Communists fired the Milan Palace of Justice, principally in the archives where the files of documents dealing with the Diana Theatre and other bomb outrages were kept. The prompt work of the firemen, however, saved most of the files, and enough remains to reconstruct the majority of those that suffered damage.   This is not the first outrage of the kind.The &quot; Continental Herald,&quot; an English weekly launched in Rome during May, loudly proclaims its absolute independence and disclaims any connection of its staff with the defunct &quot; Continental Times,&quot; a pro-German paper published during the war. The denials that the &quot; Conti-nental Herald &quot; is financed from suspicious sources seem to be confirmed by the fact that the paper has practically ceased publication, although it may very improbably be resuscitated in October.SPAIN.At the end of June the Socialist Party rejected the proposal of a general strike as a protest against the repressive measures of the Govern-ment, made by the masons&apos; union, the most important trade union in Madrid.The number of deaths by violence in all parts of Spain continues distressingly high, and there seems to be no sign of a movement making for more peaceful conditions. It would, however, be wrong to argue that a situation which produces these crimes is as grave as would be a state of affairs producing similar symptoms in England ; some of the
crimes recorded are doubtless of personal ahd not of political origin. Various rumours circulate as to the future intentions of the Syndicalists and of the Government. One credits the Syndicalists with the idea of murdering foreiguers in Barcelona in order to evoke foreign complications for the Government. The Government, on the other hand, are said to have considered the desirability of extending the activities of the Sindieato Libre to Madrid. The assassination of foreigners would, however, make foreign authorities more disposed lo co-operate with the Spanish Grovernment against the Syndicalists, and terrorism in Madrid would probably wake to activity all the bad elements in the capital instead of extirpatiug the little political crime which now exists there.The bomb which was recently exploded at the Rite Hotel in Madrid caused no personal harm, arid was designed to produce noise rather than injuries.PORTUGAL.The tram strike seemed to be no nearer solution at the end of J line. Telephone employees threatened to strike for a further rise in wages of 100 per cent. There was also further talk of a strike on the Southern and South-Western Railways.The railways, insurance companies, and other large concerns are said to meditate the formation of a secret and special police force, paid for by themselves and for which they hope State recognition. The organisa-tibri would be non-political ; its object to prevent strikes as far as possible and eliminate agents-provocateurs and bomb-throwers.2. SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES.NORWAY. A Revolt against the Extremists.Brought sharply back to facts by the failure of the general strike, many of the more moderate workmen are said to have broken away from the extreme organisation, and to be indulging some hope of emancipation from the Moscow yoke. They have been encouraged by the firmness of the authorities during the strike, by the return of the Liberals to power in the Government, by the dissensions among the adherents of Moscow, and by the aversion of many trade unionists to Communist dictatorship. On the other hand, Tranmael and his followers see a chance of forming a system of pure Communist trade unions in co-opera-tiori with the Syndicalists and Anarchists whom they hope to control by their own superiority of numbers. The Bolshevist leaders and the district organisations are now struggling between themselves for the control of the Socialist press and of the funds of the N.O.T.U. These differences are likely to result in a considerable loss of members for the N.L.P., a considerable weakening of the N.O.T.U., and the -formation of a solid and powerful revolutionary minority bloc, subject, however, to inuer friction on account of its being composed of Communists, Syndicalists, and Anarchists.After the Strike: Policy of the N.L.P.There are some signs of a return to reason, after the abortive general strike. At a gathering of leaders of trade union groups which debated the situation resulting from the strike, one leader had the courage to say that since the Government mediator would certainly hot have considered
Ithat the strike had reasonable grounds, the Government had a legal right to lay an embargo on the N.L.P. and N.O.T.U. funds. In connection with the strike, summons have been issued against several of the leaders for inciting to acts of violence and breach of the y peace. Amongst these are M. Tranmael, editor of &quot; Social Demokraten,&quot; and other publicists. The effect lias been salutary, and the feeling round Folkets Hus is for tho moment less ebullient.The N.L.P., collecting its forces after the strike, appears to have decided upon a policy of protecting negotiations concerning agreements in various trades so as to force a general settlement of agreements upon the country in October 1921. Extensive electioneering propaganda, especially directed towards winning the peasants over to an extremist agrarian programme, is indicated, as are also the organisation of secret bodies for wholesale violent sabotage and pi&apos;opaganda for a Red army. The last point worries the leaders, who have so indoctrinated Labour with their anti-militarist pacifist propaganda that barely 5 per cent, of the workers are willing to use arms, even for revolutionary ends. The N.L.P. will work for the increase of unemployment and the prevention of settlements whioh might lead to peace between masters and men.1 Communist and Terrorist Activities.&apos; Negotiations are said to be slowly proceeding between the Norwegian I Communist Youth Federation, the Young Socialist Federation, and the ^Norwegian Syndicalist Federation, aiming at the union of the Y.S.F. -and the N.S.F. into an Anarchist-Syndicalist federation, and the amalga-ination of the Anarchist Syndicalist Federation, now in process of j:i formation, with the Norwegian Communist Youth Federation into a I Norwegian-Communist-Anarchist-Syndicalist Federation. N. Tranmael I is campaigning for the union of all revolutionary organisations in Norway I either through affiliation with the Norwegian Labour Party or alliance I for common aims and objects. Certain leaders do not favour such p alliances, but prefer federations for practical objects, likely to increase I the economic power of Labour.I The Christiania Committee of Action of the Norwegian Labour S Party is reported to have decided for a policy of terror. Suitable I candidates for terrorist groups will be carefully chosen, and they will be p required to pledge their willingness to make every sacrifice for the cause, f!to carry out orders without knowing their contents beforehand, and to I suffer death for treachery.I] Many recruits are said to turn a willing ear to Communist propaganda, I though the authorities, as well as the Norwegian Labour Party, are jl reticent as to the unrest at various camps during the strike. The older p meu and reservists are reliable, but are dissatisfied with their slender[pay- .        ,, . . ;.. ;    . iTne &quot; Spartacus &quot; Idraetsforening, a sporting association of Chris-I tiania Young Communists, is now setting itself to establishing touch I with German and Czecho-Slovak revolutionary sporting associations, Band to perverting Norwegian Sporting Associations, so forming a national I union of Labour revolutionary sporting associations. Young Communists 1 are to receive some military training, and revolutionary nuclei are to be i formed within the non-Bolshevist rifle clubs. The Norwegian Labour I? Party and some unknown friends of Labour are supporting these activities I financially.i Trade with Russia.The Norwegian Commercial Delegation is back from Stockholm I without having reached an agreement with the Russian representative.
The Bolsheviks proposed new conditions, which will now be considered by the Norwegian Government. Kerjentseff had previously reported to Tchitcheriu that the Norwegian Minister lor Trade had stated that the Government is desirous of resuming trade relations with Russia.The Smuggling of Bolshevik Literature.The trial of the persons implicated in tho smuggling of Bolshevik literature into Norway produced an admission by Kyrre Grepp that he had received in all from the Communist International in Russia the sum of kr. 20,000 for distributing propaganda and the expenses of Russian couriers, &amp;c. Grepp received the heaviest sentence of those concerned   a fine of kr. 1,000 or 30 days&apos; imprisonment.Tho Order in Council prohibiting the conveyance of Bolshevik propa-ganda literature on Norwegian ships has now been repealed.Miscellaneous.&quot; Communist Children&apos;s Societies &quot; have been formed at Trorcdhjem and Bergen.   At Bergen 400 children enlisted.The seamen&apos;s and stokers&apos; strike is officially ended, the. men having agreed on a reduction in their monthly pay of 12 per cent, immediately, and a further 5 percent, on and after December 1st. The engineers&apos; and lumpers&apos; strike is also ended.The Social Democratic Labour Party in Bergen meditates the starting of a daily newspaper, which is expected to win many new members for the Social Democrats. The existing labour organ in Bergen is &quot; Arbeidet.&quot;It was reported early in July that the well-known Bolshevik agent, Captain Botchowski, had arrived at Tromso, where a conference of Norwegian Communists was to be held. Tromso is likely to be the headquarters of the campaign for creating a new Bolshevik stale, including the northern parts of Sweden, Norway, and Finland. &apos;The Russian Soviet is reported to have been running for some time a couple of small boats between Murmansk and Bergen, with crews consisting chiefly of Commissaries who confer with their Norwegian representatives. Two boats from Archangel, with no cargo but Commis-saries, have also visited Bergen. Sixty ships are said to be expected from America with coal, ordered originally, so rumour has it, from England. The orders were later cancelled and given to America. The coal will probably be discharged in Murmansk and Alexandrowsk, and the first cargoes probably in Archangel.SWEDEN.The Bolshevik Plot.The discovery of the Bolshevik plot mentioned in the Review for June has rudely jarred public complacency. The Swedes had so come to regard themselves as too orderly by nature to give way to revolutionary schemes that they were inclined to be blind to the possible effects of Bolshevik propaganda. The Bolsheviks displayed political acumen if the object of their plot was to establish a new Bolshevik territory com-prising the north of Norway, the north of Sweden, and the north of Finland. The north of Sweden and the north of Norway are the most favourable ground for Bolshevik aggression and infiltration, and the plan of establishing a northern republic is conceivable as a way of enveloping Sweden and making another corridor to the west.The police report traces the conspiracy to the Finnish Bolshevist leader Gylling, who is now in Karelia.   The police have indicated that
certain clues reveal that the plot is more extensive and complicated than was originally supposed. Tho discoveries so far made are said by a newspaper to be merely details in a big scheme of Bolshevist propaganda directed from Moscow. It appears that the Kir ana centre has been under the command of a Russian Bolshevist agent, Captain Botsiovski, and that Tromso was to be the headquarters of tho Bolshevist movement, planned for this autumn.Red Finns who have been arrested have divulged the existence in Stockholm of another Bolshevik Committee, tho &quot; Finnish Committee of the Swedish Left Socialist Organisation,&quot; which issues passports for Russia via Reval. The exodus of Bed Finns continues ; whole families have left the most northern parts of Sweden.Investigations have traced to Frams Forlag, a printing establishment in Stockholm, a system of messengers to outlying posts who, under pretext of obtaining printing orders, delivered to the forward agents instructions and other propaganda material.The several arrests made include those of Niz, the secretary of the Left Communist Party, of Edvin Thun, president of the Communist Youth Party, and of two more Red Finns, Orjo Karppanen and Henrik Faulin, who are not .total strangers to Jakobsson-Heikinen and Niemi, Valleuius will possibly be deported to Eastern Karelia. It is probable that the Finnish Bolshevik paper &quot; Viesti&quot; has been printed in Stock-holm and smuggled into Finland, through the negotiations of Vallenius. Samuelsson and Sillen have been released by the police, who have asked for the ,deportation of au Esthonian snbject, Theodor Tischler, who is suspected of complicity in the plot.Yhgve Ottosson is reported to have left Stockholm and to be in hiding in Smaland. Ottosson, Emll Andersson, and two others had been ordered to go to Moscow to atteud a conference, but owing to the discovery of the plot they are &quot; on the run.&quot;Kerjentseff.Kerjentseff&apos;s proven complicity in the plot has at length decided the Swedish authorities to request his withdrawal. For some time his position has appeared increasingly insecure. In the middle of July a Stockholm report stated that he had been recalled to Moscow and would probably not return. The change was then supposed to have some connection with the pending negotiations for a new trade agreement. Kerjentseff is no business man and has not personally negotiated a single contract during his stay in Stockholm. Warned from the first that his mission to Sweden was more in the interests of the Third International than of trade, the Swedish Government by its acceptance of and forbear-ance towards him has gone to the utmost lengths of conciliation.Trade with Russia.Early in July Kerjentseff proposed officially to the Swedish Govern-ment the opening of negotiations for a trade agreement on the same lines as those existing with other European countries. The present agree-ment is only of a preliminary character. Meanwhile, the soviet&apos;s railway commission, which has long been sitting in Stockholm, has been trans-ferred to Berlin.&apos; For the rest, the&apos; Swedes discover that difficulties beset every step towards trade with Russia. Through its Press Bureau, the Soviet has announced that its foreign delegates have been instructed not to use Swedish shipping for transport from or to Russia owing to Sweden?s quarantine restrictions.    These have become necessary through  theo   1569s
insanitary condition of Petrograd. So small are freights, however, that the soviet&apos;s action is hot seriously regarded in shipping circles.Traders are resorting to methods of self-protection. The syndicate, &quot; Exportconsortium &quot; for Russian trade, is said to be the outcome of a trade agreement between a number of highly reputed Swedish concerns, without the actual co-operation of the Swedish banks. The syndicate intends to do business with Soviet Russia without any intermediary, and it has centralised trade in order to protect itself from the bad faith of the Soviet Government. Six business men of high repute and good standing manage the &quot; Exportconsortium,&quot; no credit is proposed to Russian firms, and 50 per cent, cash with order must accompany every transaction, the remainder to be paid on receipt of documents.Miscellaneous.No &quot; Federation of Unemployed &quot; appears to exist in Sweden. A man inamed Ernst Jansson, not a Communist, heads &quot; De Arbetslosas Klubb&quot; (Club of the Unemployed), which is non-political and has no relations with the Swedish Communist Party.Large smeltings of Russian and German gold are said to have taken place at the Stockholm Mint recently. The gold was stamped with the Swedish stamp and sent in large quantities to the US.A. and to Switzerland. The &apos;&apos;Nordiska Handelsbanken&quot; is reported as a Bolshevik bank, which at present has a large stock of melted-down gold on hand.Kerjentseff&quot; has informed Moscow that the Bolshevist printing firm &quot; Progress &quot; is on the eve of bankruptcy in connection with Gryebiu&apos;s orders. He insists that it is undesirable to bring the firm to bankruptcy, especially as it has been decided in Moscow to pay all Gryebin&apos;s debts and to buy the books.DENMARK.Skilled hands  or Russia.The &quot; Social Democratic League of Youth&quot; is reported to be inspiring au agitation for encouraging young engineers and skilled workers to go to Russia for tasks of reconstruction. Representatives of the League and members of the affiliated Communist Party are in Moscow, and when they return, arrangements will be made for the journey to Russia of the 150 young mechanics who have volunteered for service. The contract, which is for a year, provides that the immigrants shall submit to the regulations of the Soviet. The ulterior object is of course the spreading of Bolshevik ideas in Denmark.In connection with the above report, it is stated that the Copenhagen Communists have promised to find 500 Danish workmen for the mann-facture of arms, ammunition, and railway material in Soviet Russia, and have opened an employment bureau for the purpose. The bureau is run by a Russian named Cholewa, and is being financed by the Soviet representative in Stockholm. The secretary is a certain Sahl, a syndicates-calist agitator and propagandist. The workmen must engage themselves for one year, must be responsible for none but themselves, and are warned that they go at their own risk and responsibility. 250 men are said to have signed contracts, and the first batch is to sail on August 1st.Miscellaneous.It is reported that a delegation has left for Stockholm to negotiate a commercial treaty with Kerjentseff.
An additional list of Danish Communists who attended the Moscow Congress includes Niels Johnsen, Geoi&apos;ge Laursen, Niels Madsen, Olafur Friedrickson and Orsell Sigurdsou.A number of forged 11. notes have been in circulation in Copenhagen. Their origin has not yet been discovered.3. CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HOLLAND.The Anti-Militarist Congress.Through &quot; Erkenntnis und Befreiung,&quot; a Socialist weekly published in Vienna, some particulars of the secret sessions of the recent Inter-national anti-Militarist Congress at The Hague have been divulged. It appears that the Dutch Government refused passports to many delegates, who yet managed to reach Holland, and it was on account of these that the secret meetings were held. Various European revolutionary and pacifist organisations were represented. The principal work done appears to have been the creation of an International anti-Militarist Bureau against War and Reaction, which is to have its seat in Holland. The title of the bureau sufficiently indicates its aims reaction means the &quot;oppression of the working classes.&quot; The organisation will propa-gate the doctrines of the general strike and of general refusal of military service, and calls for unity of work and aim amongst the revolutionary proletariat of north and south, east and west. &apos;One activity of the International anti-Militarists has been, with the help of certain Communists and members of the N.A.S. (the Extreme Union), to set on foot an agitation concerning the hunger strike of an anti-militarist named Groeuendaal, who refused military service. There have been some disturbances, especially in The Hague, but the agitation is now dying down. Groenendaal is being artificially fed, and will not be released.Communism in the Dutch East Indies.&quot;The Communist Teacher,&quot; the monthly organ of the Dutch &quot; Union of Communist Teachers,&quot; is circulated in the Dutch East Indies by van Munster, a Communist, who has been appointed Director of the Native Teachers&apos; Training College at Blitar.The decree of banishment from the Dutch East indies made against the agitator Baars has - been signed. Baars has been allowed to go via, Shanghai to the first town in Siberia. It is believed that Sneevliet is also travelling to Shanghai. A section of the local press hopes that the banishment order against Baars is the first step towards rooting out communism from the Dutch East Indies.Miscellaneous.Following the example set by Amsterdam, the Rotterdam Communist Party is to establish a section in each district of the town. Each section is to conduct an active propaganda campaign. An undercurrent, of dubiety as to the success of these plans manifested itself, as well as a tendency to attack certain leaders. There was some discontent at the. idea of the branch committee appointing the section leaders.O   15698c
GERMANY.The Third International and the German Communists.The Congress of the Third International ratified the expulsion of Paul Levi from the Communist Party, and tho opposition is forbidden to have any dealings with him. According to Radek au agreement has been readied between the Central Committee of the Gorman Communist Party and its critics. The wordy resolution passed at the Congress declares that &quot; the Congress is of opinion that the German party will carry through its &quot; future actions more successfully if it gives out its fighting paroles with &quot; more regard to the actual situation. As soon as an action has been &quot; decided upon, the decisions must bo carried out by all members. &quot; Criticism of the action can only be allowed after the action is finished, &quot; and then must take into consideration the situation in which the party is &quot; placed over against its class opponent.&quot; There is a savour of evasion here, but the dissidents were not entirely placated. They brought in a resolution after the matter had been gone into in commissions. Their resolution is identical in conteuts with that brought forwaixl by the Executive of the Third International, except that the opposition demands greater freedom of criticism after an action than that laid down by the Executive.The United Communist Party agreed to Zinovieffs proposal that the Workmen&apos;s Communist Party Congress be given three months to call a Party Congress, Tf it is then decided to submit to the discipline of the Third International, this party may be allowed to combine with the United Communist Party ; otherwise the Executive Committee of the Third International will be given authority to exclude the K.A.P.D. from the Third International.The Position of the Communist Party.Whether the pride&apos;s purge administered by Moscow will rally the declining and disorganised forces of German Communism is matter for speculation. The decision of the Third International to discontinue financial assistance to the larger brauches of the party, and to reserve their funds for less flourishing offshoots such as the English seems likely to have serious consequences. An important reason for discontinuing assistance to the German party is that it has been over-financed in the past, and the German party officials are thoroughly corrupt. The V.K.P.D. has already been compelled to dismiss some 300 officials, and does not know where to look for funds. There is no great promise from party subscriptions, which have so declined that income for April and May did not cover expenditure. The party appeal on behalf of the &quot; Rote Hilfe&quot; to provide support for the dependents of the March revolutionists has raised more than it has spent, but here again subscriptions-tions are declining. The &quot; Rote Hilfe &quot; has assisted not only Communists, but members of the K.A.P.D., U.S.P., and A.A.U., from whom it receives very few subscriptions.Meanwhile, the decline already noted in membership continues. In this connection the result of the dietine election for the Mansfeld district of Central Germany, held during the middle of June, may be taken as an index. The Communists were crushingly defeated, their votes sinking from 22,000 to less than 7,000, while other parties, notably the Indepen-dent and Majority Socialists, gained in proportion. Levi&apos;s bitter campaign against his former colleagues is seriously increasing the difficulties of the Communists. Levi is planning to use his own adherents as a &quot;cell&quot; within the party, and is working for a combination of Levites in the
United Communist Party with the Independent Socialists iu South Germany. He aims at using the Independent Socialist Press as a means for conducting propaganda against tho Central Committee of the United Communist Party, and at waging a fierce campaign against Moscow.The K.A.P.D. has boon endeavouring to raise the sinking morale of its adherents by frequent meetings. The . leaders mean to hold to their programme regarding the creation of revolutionary industrial organisa-tions, and are prepared, if necessary, to face excommunication by Moscow, The V.K.PJ);, for its part, is elaborating plans for party reconstruction, These plans renounce working on the masses as a whole, but presume use being made of the collaboration of every single individual adherent. The will to battle is not, however, very keen among the members, who arc comparatively few in number, and disinclined to risking their necks. Only the assistance of non-Communist workers who are militarily organised can lead the party to success. The juvenile members are deserting in large numbers to the &quot; Arbeiterjugend,&quot; which has grown up under the auspices of the K.A.P.D. Meanwhile, the &quot;V.K.P.D. realises that the Trade Unions are the decisive factor in the leading of the masses and are doing all they can to obtain control of them. .This activity will entail a strengthening of the system of germ cells within the German Trade Unions, the movement being controlled from Berlin with a super control in Moscow. A Berlin office of the Red Trades Union International has already been established.The advances made by the V.K.P.D. to the Majority and Independent Socialists carry with them the proviso that such advances shall not be made either by the leaders or by the Central Committee, and that they shall be of the nature of a ballon d&apos;essai. The first steps have been taken, in that the Communists have expressed their willingness to fight for the claims of tho Majority Socialists, the Independent Socialists, and the German trades unions, if these parties have the resolution to turn words and programmes into revolutionary deeds. The Independent Socialists were distrustful and- inclined to scent a plot for causing dissensions or a split in the Socialist parties, on which the Communists retorted with accusations of cowardice. The Communists mean now to bring direct pressure to bear on the working classes and to incite them to compel their leaders to say definitely whether they are or are not for a revolutionary fight, ft will be suggested that such a fight can be carried ou without the present leaders.Among the Independent Socialists themselves the moderates are said to be gradually gaining the upper hand, with a consequent relaxation of tension between the Independent and the Majority Socialists and a strengthening of the Socialist opposition to the Right and Centre Parties. In some quarters the formation is anticipated of a strong Socialist &quot; bloc,&quot; including moderate elements from among the Com-munists.Great Communist activity, financed from Russian sources, is reported in Northern Bavaria. Five secretaries, who are preparing the organisa-tion of a Red Army and making active propaganda among the members of the Reichswehr, are employed by the district committee. The United Communist Party in Hamburg is rallying its f orces for the autumn, when wage reductions may precipitate conflicts.The Communists and the Upper Silesian Question.The movements in Upper. Silesia is reported to run the risk of assuming a Communist aspect.&apos; The Bolshevik agitators have been using the failure of Korfanty to keep his promises to the Polish workers as a proof that the rising was capitalist in essence, and that only aG 2
Communist rising can liberate the workers. Both among Germans and Polos unemployment has been skilfully exploited by tho Communists, and developments may be serious if work is not shortly resumed on a large scale. It is improbable that liadok himself is in Upper Silesia ; the agitation is rather in tho. hands of a certain Maslowski/who goes under the name of Peter, and the leadership of tho Communist Party is in the hands of a certain Jaddasch. Arthur Crispien, the Independent Socialist leader, has stated that for the present the United Communist Party attaches the. greatest importance to Upper Silesia, the Central Executive of the party now being established at Gieiwitz..Another report states that during his visit to Berlin in June Krassin discussed with the leaders of the Western European Secretariat how the situation in Upper Silesia could best be exploited to the advantage of the Soviet Government. The Communist Parties in Germany, Austria, Czecho-Slovakin and Poland, and especially the organisations in the Dumbrova and Upper Silesia areas, wore ordered to call upon their members so to permeate the Polish movement that it might at a given moment declare a Soviet Government in Upper Silesia. Should this coup be successful an attempt will be made to extend operations to Poland and Germany. Karakhau is said to control the financial side of the movement and the Soviet Government to have promised to bear all expenses. The Western European Secretariat, in conjunction with the German, Austrian and Polish Communists, will direct Bolshevik activities in Upper Silesia.As against the foregoing statement the Western European Secretariat for Propaganda is said to have written in alarm to the Third International describing the wave of nationalism which the Upper Silesian question has lifted up in Germany, and pointing out that the volunteer organisa-tions may eventually be used for a reactionary coup in Germany. It is urged that steps should be taken at once to organise special units com-posed of reliable party workers, and that Moscow should grant a credit for the carrying out of all work necessary before a military section of the Third International is established.Relations with Russia.A Petrograd report states that an agreement, which has never yet been published, exists between Germany and Soviet Russia. Besides affording extensive rights and privileges to Germans, the agreement would enable Germany to augment her military supplies and evade the Treaty of Versailles by laying up stocks of munitions and arms in Russia. The leasing of the large Russian metallurgical factories to the German Government has been decided upon in principle.The Government is credited with the intention of sending a pure Industrial to Moscow as representative, but negotiations ou this matter are still in abeyance. The Soviet has declared that it wants neither a Social Democrat nor an Independent ; if he is not a Communist, he may be a member of the old regime. It is also reported that unsuccessful attempts have been made to obtain the Soviet&apos;s approval of the appoint-ment of Dr. Mueller, the Majority Socialist leader, as representative to Moscow.Local Soviet circles affirm that the Government has permitted the Soviet representatives to establish consulates in Stettin and Hamburg. The emissary proposed for Hamburg is Johannes Zarch, a hitherto unknown Bolshevik who was sent to Germany from Moscow some time ago. Zarch has been acting as deputy for Stomaniakoff during the latter1 s absence. Sixty new employees have been engaged solely for the Commercial Department of the Soviet Legation.
The Bavarian Government has refused to grant the official recog-nition and the permission to establish a Soviet consulate at Munich requested by Soviet emissaries from Prague and Vienna. The Bolshevik agents have been trying- to win support from the local commercial community.The Soviet,emissary in Berlin has protested against the expulsion of Krestinski, the Soviet Finance Commissary, from Bavaria by the State Government. The Bavarian Government has declared that it is not concerned in any arrangements made by the Imperial Government regarding the Russo-German Trade Treaty.The German-Russian Transport Company (&quot; Deutsch - Russische Transportgesellschaft,&quot; known as &quot;Derutra&quot;), which has been estab-lished for developing Russian trade relations, has made contracts with three shipping companies. The company will open a branch in Petro-grad, and organise a regular passenger service between Stettin and Petrograd.Soviet Aims.A secret conference of Soviet representatives, including Krassin and Stomaniakoff, is reported to have been held at Berlin, at which a plan for uniform activity of the Soviet representatives abroad was elaborated. The Economic Council in Moscow is to be asked to send emissaries to Western Europe especially to Germany who are to use lavish promises to lure skilled workers to Russia. One Zheu, chairman of the Soviet Council of Mines, has been sent to Germany for the purpose of settling all orders and purchases for the Russian mining industry. He is to study the future organisation of the Russian mines on German lines.Back from Moscow, Kopp is proclaiming that he has satisfied the Soviet that his policy was right, and that he did well in not sup-porting Lutovinoffs efforts to conclude a formal agreement with the German militarists against Poland and the Entente. In future the Western European Secretariat will finance and direct German Communism ; Kopp will merely check the sum spent on propaganda, and will act as a diplomat rather than as an agent of the Executive Committee of the Third International.A Bolshevik Raid.Towards the end of July the Bolsheviks undertook a sensational raid of their own at Charlottenburg on the house of the Russian Colonel Freyberg, who has been for some months past representing SemenofF, and who has been accused by the Communist press of recruiting members of the new anti^Bolshevik army. The raid was evidently instigated by Kopp, who has been sending notes of protest to the German Government, quoting passages from documents in the possession of Freyberg. Seven men figured in it. The colonel was away from home, and in his flat were only his wife and a Russian officer, Captain Bulugen. They were covered with revolvers, and the raiders, who represented themselves as coming from the Berlin Police Presidency to search the house, carried away all the documents they could find.Soviet Personnel.StqmaniakofF, the Russian trade emissary, left Berlin for Moscow on June 25th. V. V. Starkov is filling his place during his absence. StornaniakofPs journey has for principal object to present the Soviet with a scheme for the extension of commercial relations between Russia and Germany.
Report has it that Lutovinofl is to be appointed Cousul-Genofal for Political Affairs at the Soviet Mission, and that Kopp will be Councillor, with duties specially assigned to him by the Department of Foreign Trade and the Foreign Office.Lutovinoff has informed Tchitcherin that he doubts whether Schein-mann would be of any use for political work iu Germany. Scheinmanu&apos;8 appointment would lead to StomauiakofFs departure and the disorganisation-tion of the trade question, which is progressing favourably. Lutovinoff affirms that he could not be responsible for the Commissariat for Foreign Trade if Scheiumann were given the slightest influence in directing.the work of the most important trade representatives.It is not yet definitely established whether Kalakutsky has arrived in Berlin. Report has it that he was recently appointed Chief of the Soviet Foreign Espionage and Counter Espionage service, with residence in Berlin. The person calling himself Stepanov, whose arrival in Berlin was noted in the Review for June, may be identical with Kalakutsky.Hugo Stinnes.Competent Stock Exchange circles incline to the belief that the situation of Stinues is precarious financially, and that his collapse will occur within three or four years at the latest. His enterprises are so many and various that he cannot bring them all to fruition. Such large opponents as the Wolf-Strauss combine, which has concentrated on one line, have a noticeable advantage over Stinnes. His strained relations with Rathenan have upset Stinnes&apos; schemes for participating in the reconstruction of Northern France, and in the Austrian Succession States the opposition of the Skoda-Schueider-Creusot group is seriously hindering his designs. Stinnes&apos; activities in Hungary have decreased, but his negotiations for the control of the Rima Murany Steel Mines are continuing, and he seems to have inspired the proposed amalgamation of Rima Murany with the Salgotarzan eonl mines. Stinnes&apos; agents have been active in Denmark. Here Stinnes is master of more than one industrial concern, and is trying to obtain control of the Kalundborg Shipyard and of the Codan Dockyard at Copenhagen.Recent reports on the activities of Stinnes indicate that he has been granted extensive concessions in Russia, including one to exploit the almost virgin deposits of coal near Rostov, and a permit to start large cotton plantations in Turkestan. In all cases Stinnes has the right to bring his own labour with him. He is also said to have resumed his negotiations for concessions in the Ukraine.Stinnes is said to have done his best to cut out the Hamburg Amerika line with the Soviet Government and to conclude an agreement between the laltter and his own shipping company, but his plans were upset by the Wolf Strauss concern. In conjunction with these schemes Stinnes made unsuccessful demands for oil concessions at Baku. The SoViet Trade Delegation in Berlin is now beginning to buy products of all kinds in increasing quantities.According to the Independent Socialist Party large sums of Stinnes&apos; money have been used in organising the Upper Silesian &quot; Selbst-Schutz.&quot; The money was obtained through the intermediary of Ludeudorff.Oriental Intrigues.The heir apparent of Afghanistan has been in Berlin, where he was iu frequent intercourse with local Turks.It is said that the Oriental Club will shortly be dissolved, as the Turks wish to have a new and exclusively Turk Club.   In spite of the
predilections of: some of its memberg the Oriental Club seems to have no actual connection with the Bolsheviks.The objects of the mission to Germany of Lieut.-Colonel Nouri Bey, ex-Governor of Angora, whose expulsion has since been reported, included negotiations with certain German factories regarding undelivered rolling stock valued at  T.15,000,000, which sum was paid by the Turkish Government to Germany during the war. Nouri Bey was also to try to obtain arms and aeroplanes from Germany, and to do propaganda work on behalf of Mustapha Kemal, with a view to counteracting the influence of Enver Pasha in Berlin. Kemalist agents are said to be actively recruiting for KemaPs army, offering very high pay and respon-sible posts. It is even said than an offer, declined for obvious reasons, was made to Liman von Sanders.Enver Pasha is reported to have been expelled from Berlin and to be now in Moscow. Enver arrived in Berlin from Moscow at the end of May, with a false passport supplied by the Soviet Government. His mission was to recruit, as many as possible unemployed German engineers and discharged soldiers, who were to help in organising and equipping the Bolshevist campaigns against outlying portions of the British Empire.Oriental Intrigues.S. N. das Gupta has gone to Tndia from Germany to report promises of help from various countries in support of a revolution. He is to state that Indian revolution activities abroad are not co-ordinated by a central body of Indian workers, and that such a body should be established at once, in order to concert the efforts of detached workers with those of the Central Committee in India.   Workers must also be sent abroad.Heramba Gupta, alias Lopez, is acting as the Berlin representative of the Indian Revolutionary Committee. The Committee are by no means pleased at the desire of the Soviet to impose upon them principles which are to be introduced into India by propaganda. They want to work in their own way, and will decide at a meeting with the Soviet Government in Moscow whether they will co-operate or will adopt all the principles of the Soviet Government.Sinn Fein Propaganda.The Sinn Fein Committee in Berlin is said to work under the guise of the League of Truth, and to be in close touch with local Egyptians and anti-British Indians, with whom plans were discussed for a simul-taneous outbreak in July. A German-American named Martin directs the committee, which disposes of some 600,000 marks for propaganda in Ireland and has a number of German police officials in its pay. Literature printed hi Berlin is sent by courier to London for trans-mission to Ireland. A monthly review dealing with Irish affairs is to be published in Berlin. The Irish Committee in Moscow are betaking themselves to Berlin to establish their headquarters there.The Orgesch.Despite strict prohibitions recruiting for the illegal military, organi-sations is said to continue in Bavaria, Prussia, and other parts of Germany, chiefly among ex-soldiers and the unemployed. In Bavaria the Orgesch has surrendered part of its equipment, but the formations have been retained, aud most of the arms have been sent to Tyrol. The volunteers recruited are sent in part to Upper Silesia, through the closed frontier, and in part distributed on large country estates.The Independents are said to have confidentially informed the Chancellor that should the Government fail to dissolve the Qrgesch
and other military organisations the Labour parties will themselves establish armed Labour organisations.It has since been reported that the Orgesch has been &quot;declared illegal, and that any printer who is caught printing lor it is liable to heavy penalties and the closure of his works.Miscellaneous.An International Anarchist Congress will be held in Berlin during October, according to a decision made by the Anarchist Group iu Paris and surrounding district.According to reliable information, the Central Bureau of the Com-munist Party in Berlin is forging passports, sauf-conduits, and official stamps.A number of prominent Reds are said to have arrived in Berlin early in June, with a view to assisting at the Communist Congress which will be held shortly at Eisbaeh.It is reported that the French renegade Sadoul is to visit Germany and Czecho-Slovakia, charged with the re-organisation of these countries and of the Bolshevik propaganda services there, which are deemed insufficient by Moscow.Lazerson appears to have abandoned his intention of bringing an action for slander against Lomonosov in the ^German Courts. Legal opinion was against him, and the question of policy was also raised.A number of German ex-officers are said to have decided to enrol themselves in the Russian Soviet Army. The well-known&quot; Hanover Communist Heinrich Buhl, a former German officer and prisoner in Russia, is going to Russia in command of the German Officers&apos; Corps.Thanks to the Trade Agreement, Soviet Russia is said to be able to buy arms in England. These are sent to Stettin, where, after having been unloaded, they are despatched to Altdamm. In June 456 British rifles of the latest model left Stettin for Essen, as at the next putsch the principal effort will be made in Essen and the Ruhr district.A great mass of revolutionary literature in all languages is reported to be turned out from the works of Leopold Stern in Berlin. The establishment is said to communicate directly with Communist groups and organisations in all the principal towns of Europe, and with the Soviet Mission in Berlin.The stories of the industry of German workmen which are now appearing in the British press should not be accepted without question. The German workers, like their brethren the world over, wore demoralised by the war. They have an eight hours day, but they do not put in eight hours work. The housing problem is partially solved by the compulsory quartering of tenants upon householders possessing accommodation in excess of their personal needs.SWITZERLAND. A Fresh Communist Campaign.The acute industrial depression, which threatens to become intensified, is being exploited by the Communists for their own political ends. Large sections of the workers are convinced that the employers have provoked the present crisis in order to force the unions to accept lower wages, and the Communists, who are rapidly gaining ground, are preparing a new campaign directed against the lowering of wages. They are steadily working for the control of the unions, helped by the fact that the leaders
of the Socialist Party in German Switzerland, in Geneva, and in some other places in French Switzerland, completely sympathise with Oom-munist policy, and aim at putting the &quot; Union Syndicale &quot; under the control of the Socialist Party, and at getting rid of moderate secretaries. The trade union leaders are growing anxious at the prospects of a split between moderates and extremists, and are in danger of being left alone with a dwindling moderate minority.A new development of Communist propaganda is reported from Lausanne, where the Swiss-German section of the Communist Party organised an academic lecture on Communism, delivered by Fritz Flatten, the leader of the Swiss Communists.A propagandist organisation is publishing special periodicals sub-subsidised by the Soviet Government apparently to the tune of 20,000 Swiss francs monthly. These periodicals are &quot; L&apos;Internationale des Jeunes,&quot; &quot; Der Junge Genosse,&quot; &quot; Das Proletarische Kind.&quot; Birinkov, an ex-Tolstoyan and a controller of propaganda in Switzerland, has been in Germany in connection with this propaganda. He has supplied Humbert-Droz, the leader of Communist propaganda in Switzerland, with a subsidy of 75,000 francs for three months on his own respon-sibility. Iu the course of this period Birinkov will again visit Switzer-land to confer with Humbert-Droz personally.Eastern Extremists.The Congress of Syrians, which&apos; should have been held at Geneva during June, has been postponed until August 25th. A Syrian Informa-tion Bureau is meanwhile to be established at Geneva.A meeting of Moslems took place at Lausanne during June, at which union was urged with a view to the liberation of the oppressed races of Islam. Turks, Egyptians, and Persians were present a fact which seems to indicate that the previous coolness between these elements is disappearing.Jevad Bey, the recently appointed Turkish Minister at Berne, is said to be taking much interest in Nationalist propaganda. He recently discussed this matter with Haroun Alitche, the Nationalist representative. Jevad is apparently seeking to usurp the authority of Jami Bey, with few prospects of success, since Jami controls all the funds.Sent on a propaganda mission by the Central Committee of the Syrian Union in Cairo, one Tewfik el Yaziji is now in Switzerland. He edited a daily paper, &quot; El Dafar,&quot; in Damascus in the time of the Emir Feisal&apos;s supremacy there. On Tewfik&apos;s own statement the Central Committee of the Syrian Union is working to clear French and British out of Syria aDd Palestine, and to unite the country from the frontier of Egypt to Cilicia in one confederation.Ali Shemsi Bey, the Egyptian Nationalist, arrived in Geneva at the end of June, as an emissary of Zaghloul Pasha, and amply provided with funds for propaganda. On his way to Switzerland he seems to have engineered a press campaign in Italy. On his arrival in Geneva he got into touch with Mohamed Fehmi, president of the Young Egyptians in Europe. Ali Shemsi states that Zaghloul wishes to come to an agreement with Adli, Zaghloul working on the Egyptian population, and Adli negotiating in London. Egyptian circles in Geneva and Mohamed Fehmi in particular incline to believe that the complete independence of Egypt is unattainable at present, and that meanwhile as much as possible must be extracted from England.
Eastern Extremists.A Korean revolutionary, Kwanyong Lee, is reported to be at present studying international law in Zurich. He was the secretary of the revolutionary Korean delegation, which was sent to Paris at the time of the Peace Conference, and he conducts active propaganda against the Japanese.Sinn Fein Intrigues.A certain Father Staunton, one of Gavan Duffy&apos;s secretaries, has arrived in Switzerland as Irish delegate and has been instructed to discuss with the pro-Irish committee the nature of its activities. The committee is now working diligently, and Wolhauser is to travel to Switzerland as a propagandist. The arrival is also expected of an &quot;Envoy Extraordinary of the Irish Republic&quot; in Switzerland, who will order the work of the Committee and get into direct touch with the &quot; Friends of Irish Freedom &quot; in America. Sinn Fein press propaganda has for chief organs the &quot; Neue Ziircher Zeitung &quot; ; the &quot; Journal de Geneve &quot; ; &quot; Der Wiichter,&quot; and the &quot; Oltener Nachrichten,&quot; the connection of the pro-Irish committee with the last two papers being particularly close.It has been suggested to S. T. 0&apos;Kelly, the Irish Republican representative in Paris, that Dr. Unger should be appointed Irish &quot; Consul-General &quot; in Switzerland and M. de Sury d&apos;Apremont &quot; Vice-Consul &quot; in Friburg. Since both men are Swiss the danger of expulsion would be avoided. Father Staunton has been notified from Paris that arrange-ments have been made for the holding of an International Congress of the Irish race in France or Italy during August. Staunton forwarded the name of Dr. Unger as representative of the Irish movement in Switzerland at this Congress.AUSTRIA.Relations with Russia.The Chancellor, Herr Schober, has stated that the Government intends to reach an agreement with Russia corresponding in the main to the arrangement made between Germany and Russia in May last. This aims at developing the respective prisoners of war missions into actual delegations, which would exercise consular powers and initiate commercial relations between the two States. Bronski has gone to Moscow to submit the result of conversations to his Government.No successor to Bronski has yet been appointed. A German Com-munist, Lange, and Marklevski, who has now succeeded Bersin at Helsingfors, were suggested, but in both cases Dr. Mayr protested. It should be remembered that the Austrian Government refused to recognise Bronski even as Russia&apos;s commercial representative, and he, therefore, nominally took charge of the Russian Prisoners of War Bureau in Vienna.The Position or the Communists.Bolshevik activity in Austria has been diminished by the absence of most of the important leaders at the Congress of the Third International.The nature of Austrian Communism has recently been summarised by Gustav Lohner, who can perhaps hardly be considered a pure Communist. According to Lohner the Austrian Communist Party has vague notions of establishing Communism in Austria, but no practical ideas as to the manner of bringing it about, and apparently no conception of the con-sequences that would ensue to Austria.   As for the party itself, Lohner
describes it as a wholly unstable conglomeration of an almost ludicrous general effect ; and completely non-dangerous under proper treatment. It would fall to pieces under the least shock, which, however, it is hardly worth while troubling to apply.Meantime, the Strasser-Lohuer group, who form the Austrian Levites, have their own fish to fry. They mean to get into touch with the Pink International, in the hope of establishing the Levites as its left wing, or, preferably, of converting the International en bloc to Levite Communism. In the meantime, while waiting for Moscow&apos;s ruling, the Levites are making propaganda in the State Industrial works, where they hope that a plebiscite would turn in their favour. They are also negotiating secretly with the Transport Arbeiter Verband.The orthodox Communists are agitating seriously in the trades unions against the present Socialist leaders and are working for a policy of revolt and for strikes leading possibly to a general strike. The trades unions are countering this propaganda by a call to moderation.A Trade Union Agitation.The textile workers of Neunkirchen have asked the Unionvorstand of the Textile Workers immediately to approach the Trade Union Commission and to begin a common action of all trade unions against any further rise in prices of necessities, reduction of wages, and the plan of the employees to discharge their workmen en. bloc and close down their industries. The Socialist and Communist parties are now discussing a common procedure against the Government and its plan of decreasing subsidies on food stuffs, and are attempting to work out a common tactical procedure in case of a general strike. More attention is to be given to the unemployed question.Miscellaneous.SchafTgotsch is now beginning to come into the open, and has addressed a meeting of Communist soldiers. His connection with the &quot; Spezielle Rundschau,&quot; which issues Lenin&apos;s special orders, has already been mentioned.Pierre Ramus (Rudolf Grossrnann), leader of the &quot; Union of Master-less Socialists in Austria,&quot; is about to undertake a journey of propaganda through Austria. Ramus is an anarchist, equally opposed to Marxian theories and to Lenin&apos;s Bolshevism. His anti-militarist gospel is directed even at circles which are not socialist. Ramus has been talking of the &quot; Peter Kropotkin&quot; Memorial Committee in Russia, which aims at forming an international centre of anarchist thought and spreading Kropotkin&apos;s ideas and teachings over the whole world. Ramus in Austria, and Rudolf Rocker in Germany represent this Committee.CZECHOSLOVAKIA. The Progress of Communism.An ex-member of the Czech Communist Party, Kucera, has stated in the Prague newspaper, &quot; Pravo Lidu,&quot; that the Communists of Czecho-Slovakia have received money from Moscow in order to smash the Czecho-Slovak Republic at any price, so that Czecho-Slovakia may disappear from the map of Europe. Kueera was sent to Moscow to negotiate with Bela Kun, bat his patriotism eventually proved stronger than his Communism.Meanwhile, Communism is stated to be slowly and steadily increasing in Slovakia.   It is helped by economic conditions and, more markedly,
by foreign influence. The Hungarian Social Democratic party had organised the Slovak industrial workers before the war ; Magyar and Polish propaganda now helps the Communist movement in furtherance of the national policy of the two States. The Czech Communist Party in Slovakia, in spite of quarrels, keeps close touch with the Magyar and German Communist Party. An unusual and significant collaboration is observable of the Christian Socialists with the Slovak Communists for the overthrow of the present regime.From other sources it is reported that an intense Bolshevik propaganda is proceeding in the Czecho-Slovak army, and that the reception of the Czecho-Slovak Communist Party into the Third International has been agreed upon.Relations with Russia.The Czech Government has refused to accept Aralov as head of a Soviet Commercial Mission at Prague. Aralov&apos;s former activities in directing Red Guards against the Czechs decidedly discredit him.The recent meeting in Berlin between representatives of Czecho-Slovak iron industries and Stomoniakov, at which trade prospects between Russia and Czecho-Slovakia were discussed, resulted in very little progress. Prices in Czecho-Slovakia are so much higher than in Germany that there seems to be little prospect of successful competition.According to the &quot; Pravo Lidu &quot; the Executive Committee of the Third International has acknowledged to- its confidential agents abroad the hopelessness of the position in Russia, and the urgent need of recognition and trade relations. Czecho-Slovakia, as the most favour-able centre for organisation in Central Europe, must be gained for propaganda objects, a statement scarcely reconcilable with Moscow&apos;s alleged determination to destry Czecho-Slovakia.Mostovenko, the extreme Communist who heads the Russian Trade Delegation at Prague, is said to have taken a leading part in organising the last Communist outbreak in Germany. He had much to do with discrediting Kopp and Dr. Hillerson and bringing about their recall. The whole of Hillersou&apos;s organisation has, according to a member of the Hillerson Mission, been handed over to Mostovenko&apos;s Mission.HUNGARY.Communism.The Hungarian police think that the activities of Bolshevik agents do not at present constitute a serious danger for the country.The West Hungarian Communists are in close touch with Vienna. Schlesinger, their permanent representative in the secretariat of the Communist Party in Vienna, is frequently iu conference with the &quot; Verein der Westungarn in Wien &quot; ; he is also chief of the Hungarian branch of the Communist Juvenile Secretariat which has been formed in Vienna, and editor of the &quot; Uj-Harcos,&quot; a Communist propaganda organ. Schlesinger does not deny his difficulties,&apos; but claims excellent results for his propaganda.The present aims of the Hungarian Communists appear to be the establishment of separate trades unions in Western Hungary, the putting forward of candidates for election to such bodies as the Nationalrat and the Landtag, and the infiltration of Communists into Austrian battalions detailed for the occupation of Western Hungary.
The Green International.- M. Janos Mayer, one of the State Secretaries of the Ministry of Agriculture, and Dr. Kafoly Schandl are visiting Paris in order to organise in France &quot; The World&apos;s Association of Farmers,&quot; better known as the Green International. Some suspicion has hitherto attached, to this Association in French Socialist circles, owing to the fact that Germans and Bavarians have been its most enthusiastic supporters. Hungarian members of the Association are said to be convinced that the Green International will eventually triumph in Russia and reorganise that country on a Socialist Peasant basis of government. The Left Wing of the Small Landowners&apos; Party in Hungary favours the Green Inter-national.The Republican Movement.It is stated that a meeting held at Steinamanger in the middle of June elaborated a plan for the proclamation of a republic under the leadership of Szabo of Nagytad. Technical difficulties and the situation abroad have so far prevented the accomplishment of fhis plan.Under the leadership of Buza, Minister of Agriculture after tho first Hungarian revolution, a new political party has been formed under the name of &quot; The Party of Liberty.&quot; It is in fact an agrarian Republican Party, and looks to the capture of 600,000 labourers. The new party has little influence with the National Assembly.4. RUSSIA AND THE BORDER STATES. RUSSIA.The Third International.Limitations of space render it impossible to deal in full with the recent Congress of the Third International. The decisions with regard to the questions affecting the German and Italian Communists, which were among the most important points with which the Congress had to deal, are mentioned under those countries.There appears to have been a general recognition of the fact that hopes of any immediate world revolution must be postponed, as was indeed confessed by Radek in his wordy thesis on &quot; Tactics,&quot; and even more frankly by Bukharin. Lenin said modestly that the Congress was a review of the Communist forces for the purpose of making an exact calculation of the possibilities of a world revolution.Lenin told the moderates in a private conversation that the birthplace and only home of Communism was Russia, and that the position there could only be saved by a proletarian revolution in such industrial countries as Germany, England, and America. As regarded ideas, England was their greatest enemy, and was undoubtedly directing the consolidation of the bourgeois system throughout the world.The debates, in fact, make it quite clear that the chief enemy of Communism is England. Britain&apos;s is the unseen hand which everywhere thwarts the schemes of the International; hence the perpetual insistence that revolution must be brought about in England, and the &quot; bourgeois tendency &quot; of the British workers perverted by the illegal entry of British Communists into labour organisations.ZinoviefFs justification of active measures was supported by almost all the Russian Communists, including Lenin. Zinovieff accused the leaders of the Right Wing of West European Communism of not having known how to direct the movement.   Parties must be organised which
will take determined charge of the active steps of the working classes. Zinovieff declared that in many states the forthcoming attack upon Communists would bear fruit, and that Communists must abandon mere propaganda work, and take the word&quot; Action&quot; as their motto.Nuorteva, Director of the Department of Propaganda, reported that all the work of the International must in the present year be directed primarily to agitation, with a view to unifying Socialist parties round the guiding centre of the Third International. The fundamental tasks ordered by the Second Congress had been carried out; the Communist task in the West during the current year would consist of an uninter-rupted struggle against the social compromises, in parliamentary struggle and in propaganda work, with a view to educating the working masses in the spirit of the Third International. Principal attention must be devoted to a new factor the defence by world capital in the struggle against Communist teaching. The policy must be .011c of peaceful construction.Nuorteva stated that in England, Scotland, and Ireland there were 176 Communist nuclei and labour organisations, comprising 40,000 sub-scribing members ; 890 agitators graduated from the Manchester and Cardiff propaganda institutes.The transference of Central Headquarters from Moscow to the West has been postponed. Reports on this subject are, however, conflicting ; one mentions that a central office is to be opened in Berlin.The Executive Committee is reported to have agreed to the proposals of the Jewish section that a special Jewish Department be formed to carry on propaganda amongst Jewish workmen throughout the world, this department to keep in touch with other International Communist propaganda sections and work hand in hand with them.The Right Wing of the Communists in Western Europe is said to be dissatisfied with the present personnel of the Executive Committee of the Third International. It accuses Zinovieff and his friends of having broken the Communist movement in Western Europe and alienated the masses by a useless shedding of the blood of German Communists. Tho Right Wing insist ou the restriction of the influence of Moscow and on the granting of greater independence of action to Western organisations. For their part, the Left circles of the Russian Communist Party support a policy of terror and urge the extension of the Third International in the West by creating revolution in tbe Border States.The Red Trade Union International.An important result of the Congress of the Red Trade Union International was a decision, by 337 votes to 11, that the International should continue in permanence. The International was established a year ago, and now, according to its general secretary, Losovsky, embraces 17,000,000 organised workers, and has become a powerful rival of the Amsterdam International. Tom Mann, who formerly kept a public house in London, which he left after a conviction for selling watered beer, was chosen to represent England, Australia, and South Africa on the Executive Committee. Mann told his colleagues that a far-reaching change of heart had permeated the English working class. Toilers were growing more and more conscious that class warfare was inevitable and proletarian dictatorship a necessity. Losovsky had sufficient optimism to declare that the greatest progress had been made in Britain, and that there the old prejudices in favour of capitalism were dis-appearing.
The most important decisions reached by the Congress were to take steps to unite all trade unions into one fighting organisation with one international centre, viz., the Red Trade Union International ; to establish close contact with the Third International by joint represen-tation on both executive committees, and by joint conferences, this connection to have a business character and to consist in the joint preparation of revolutionary action. It was decided that it was necessary for every country to strive for the uniting of the trade union movement and for tho carrying out of the decisions of both the Red Trade Union and the Communist International. Thus bound to the Third International, the Red Trade Union International becomes the organ of that body, working by similar means to similar ends. There were some struggles for independence, perhaps the most notable being made by the Spanish delegate Orlandi. But, on the-whole, the syndicates-calists showed less antagonism than was expected. The French Syndicalists themselves agreed to the necessity of reforming their programme and working in close contact with the Communist Inter-national, although they made reservations with regard to the indopen-dence of industrial organisations in the period after the revolution.The following were elected to the executive of the Congress: Losovsky and Rykov (Russia), Rosmer (France and Belgium), Knight (America and Canada), Heckert (Germany and Austria), Tom Mann (England, Australia, and South Africa), Nin (Spain), Maziewski (Poland), Hampe (Czecho-Slovakia), and Pawlovic (Balkan States).The Position oi the Soviet Government.The position in the Commissariat of Foreign Affairs seems still to be delicately balanced, but to be inclining to the side of the extremists. As has already been mentioned, Tchitcherin is on the side of Krassin and the moderates, Whose orientation is, if anything, pro-British ; Litvinoff supports the Trotsky, Bukbarin, and Radek group, which is opposed to &quot; playing witii England,&quot; and is credited with advocating an agreement between Russia and Germany. Litvinoff himself is an avowed enemy of Great Britain, and a warm supporter of German aspirations, (hough he admits the necessity of the Anglo-Russian Trade Agreement, as it might secure de facto recognition for Russia from England and consequent moral support. LitviuofFs activities at Reval markedly favoured Ger-mauy ; his appointment as Commissary for Foreign Affairs would threaten the gradual exclusion of England from the Russian market. It is said that a decree appointing him was drafted, but was vetoed at the last, moment by-Lenin. Matters are for the moment in abeyance, until future Communist policy abroad has been decided.There are reports that two new political factors are emerging from the decomposition of the Communist Party, one internal, the other external. The internal factor, the timid &quot; labour opposition&quot; within the party, is seeking to join issue with the external factor, the Communist opposition growing outside the party, which calls itself the &quot; Workers&apos; and Peasants&apos; Socialist Party,&quot; and demands power for the Soviets and not for the Communist Party. This new party has, however, no real significance or influence.According to stories which have reached Danish Communists, the Left Wing Communists, headed by Dzerzhinsky, were discussing, during the first half of June, plans for the overthrow of Lenin. Dzerzhinsky went so far as to say that some of the commissaries had promised every assistance in opposing Lenin and that Trotsky had promised to help in any revolt which they might plan. Lenin heard of these plots, had a heated discussion with Trotsky and finally decided to defer action until
after the meeting of the Third International.   It is suggested that the plot caused the postponement of the conference,Schiiapnikov, the leader of the Workers&apos; Opposition, and Sapranov, the loader of the Democratic Trade Union Group, have been elected to the Presidium of the Supreme Council of People&apos;s Economy. &apos; Lenin is said to be supported by the Supreme Council of Peoplo&apos;s Economy, by Schiiapnikov and Rudzutak, a member of the Collegium of the All-Russian Central Soviet of Trade Unions, and also by certain persons associated with the Extraordinary Commission. These reports would seem to indicate that Lenin and the Central Trade Union Group have been compelled to form a coalition with the right wing of the Communist Party.Economic Affairs.The famine is the subject of an Article in Part II.Pessimism dominates the Soviet view of the execution of the economic reforms. Change of economic policy indicates no change of heart. The granting of concessions to foreigners means little, as the Russians themselves, owing to laziness and lack of initiative, have always invested their capital abroad. Profits, which formerly went to the owners- of the concessions, will now go to the Government. It is importaut to observe that concessions will only be granted for a limited period, and will revert to the Government in good condition and well organised. The Soviet thus anticipates getting within its grip, at little cost to itself, a restored and efficient industry. No Russian subjects will receive con-cessions ; they may not even be sleeping partners in such undertakings. The Government has the right to keep all it needs of what is produced  surplus only may be exported. Political factors will bo taken into consideration in the granting of concessions. France, for instance, will receive scant encouragement ; but America, Germany and Sweden will be favoured. Lack of capital will probably prevent the Poles from taking over concessions, but commercial relations will be facilitated should Poland conclude a trade agreemeut with the Soviet.Reports from Helsingfors indicate that the Soviet has now removed all restrictions regarding the possession of private capital. No limit is set upon the money and remittances which nationalised banks may receive, and these sums are inviolable and cannot be confiscated. All previous restrictions regarding money transactions are removed. The banks have no right to give information regarding depositors.In a circular letter to Government Executive Committees, Moscow announces that the Republic is on the eve of an extremely acute fuel crisis and of a complete paralysis of railways, due principally to the fact that far less firewood is now being transported by road. Various measures have been prescribed to speed up road transport.The Extraordinary Commission.The Ail-Russian Central Executive Committee is reported to have adopted Krylenko&apos;s project for reorganising the revolutionary tribunals of the Soviet Republic, and limiting the power of the Extraordinary Commission. Krylenko&apos;s project seems to depend on Lenin&apos;s ability to carry out his general policy. If Lenin fails, Krylenko, who is the Public Prosecutor of the Supreme Revolutionary Tribunal, fails also. Krylenko&apos;s efforts may be considered part of the struggle proceeding between the Moderates and the Extremists of the Soviet. Unshlicht, formerly a member of the Polish Social Democratic Labour.Party, and a member of tho Seventh All-Russian Central Executive Committee, is reported to
have succeeded&apos; Dzerzhinsky as President of the Extraordinary Com-mission.Secret orders are said to have been issued that the political sections of the Extraordinary Commission are to be transferred to tho Criminal Investigation Department of the Supreme Revolutionary Tribunal, in which they will function as special sections. So far, Moscow and Petrograd are alone affected, but the system will gradually he extended throughout Russia.The Anti-Jewish Movement.The anti-Semitic wave is reported to be rising steadily, and pogroms., which are of daily occurrence in Great Russia, are constantly sweeping over new1 provinces. - The reasons lie in the fact that the peasants obstinately resist the application of Communist doctrines, and blame the Jews for all the misfortunes that have befallen Russia. There has been a great flight of Jews towards the Roumanian and Polish frontiers. The organs of the Soviet have demanded that the civil and military authorities should immediately do all in their power to put an end to anti-Jewish pogroms, but Lenin replied that at present he is not prepared to oppose openly the peasants and evoke their anger by defending the Jews. A general resolution was therefore passed instructing all local authorities to concentrate on maintaining peace and order in their respective districts.Military Plans.The present agreement of the Communist International with the Revolutionary Military Council is reported to be au indication that Trotsky favours an aggressive policy. This assumption gains an added significance from the facts that the 11th Army is being brought up to full fighting strength ; that efforts are being made to raise a Red Georgian Army, 35,000 strong, and that the formation of an Armenian Army, 15,000 strong, has been spoken of ; that the entire railway system in&apos; the Caucasus has been militarised, and that propaganda is being undertaken to strengthen the morale of the troops in tho Caucasus area. On the other hand, Tchitcherin&apos;s instructions to Tiflis appear to indicate that no immediate hostilities are likely in the direction of Anatolia or Persia.   A waiting policy would appear to be probable.Information obtained in England states that the Soviet is organising a defensive Army, so that it may hold back any attack until the winter.Reports continue that the Soviet is partially mobilising its armies. The mobilisation is variously described as directed against the Far Eastern Republic and the Border States. In the &quot; Pravda,&quot; however, Radek has formally denied that Russia is mobilising against Poland.Trotsky is said to have told the French delegates to the Moscow Congress that a Bolshevik army of 80,000 men would be ready to help the Indian nationalists throw the British out of India. Another report states that the Soviet, though it has decided to&apos; do its utmost to avoid conflict with Great Britain, has also resolved to strengthen its influence in Central Asia, and to get into closer contact with the Turkish Nationalists. Troops, money, ammunition and artillery have been sent to Angora. Bolshevik agents were responsible for the rejection of the Franco-Turkish Treaty by the Angora Constituent Assembly.The Soviet Commander-in-Chief on the Turkestan front has issued an order of the day to the Red troops being sent on frontier guard service to the Pamir, in which the soldiers are called the outposts of revolution. These Bed troops have been named the &quot;Trotsky Detachment.&quot;0  15G98d
Secret, records in the Moscow War Office put the number of Germans in the Bed Army at some 14,000, including 12,000 soldiers, 380 doctors, and 1,300 doctors&apos; assistants.The Provincial UnrestInsurrection is spreading in the districts of Tamboff, Voronesh, Kursk, and Orel, as well as in the territories between the Volga and the Siberian frontier, where the peasants have taken possession of the towns.The Sovnarkom is reported to have brought forward a project to grant autonomy to all the 11 Cossack territories, each territory to be under the rule of a territorial Ataman elected by the Cossack Rada or Soviet. All decisions of the Cossack Soviet must be ratified by tbe Commissar of the Soviet Republic attached to the Rada. This Com-missar will be the link between the Cossack territory and the Republic.Wrangel is reported to be much interested in the Ukrainian question. His&quot; Budapest representative has been instructed to complete the units of the Ukrainian insurgents with officers from the Russian Volunteer Army. So far, 472 officers are said to (have been sent to Kashan, and then to Orel, on the pretext of repatriating them with the assistance of the Hungarian Government.Propagandist Activities.In connection with Bolshevik propaganda it is reported that the Soviet Delegation to Persia took with it some 30 agitators for work in India. Soviet agitators are entering India through Afghanistan and Baluchistan, and German officers are working at Moscow in organising propaganda In India. Funds and literature for strikes in England are being sent via Scandinavia. Krassin&apos;s Delegation is now, however, under strict orders not to communicate with British Communists, to avoid raising suspicion.The Bolshevik Trading Delegation in England is in the habit of sending copies of &quot;Izvestia,&quot; tbe official organ of the Soviet, to a revolutionary journal in Glasgow called the &quot; Worker.&quot; The propa-gandist nature of the &quot; Izvestia&quot; seems to render this a breach of the trading agreement.It is stated that at the Soviet Mission at Riga, Bolshevik literature has been seen mailed to the &quot; Daily Herald.&quot; The packages consisted of all Soviet newspapers, publications aud propaganda, telegrams about the proceedings of the Third International Congress, and letters and packages addressed to some unknown private person, c/o &quot; Daily Herald.&quot; Similar correspondence was also being sent to the New York daily, &quot;Forward&quot; a Jewish publication.At a secret meeting of Russian Anarchist Communists, held in London on June 20th, a special committee of five members Katz, Lenoble or Lenobel, Tapler, Lax or Laks, and Javorski was elected to devote its entire attention to propaganda in the British Colonies.Phillips Price is stated to be the director of the U.K. Branch of the Intelligence Department of the Soviet Government. One Miss Harrison i maintains the liaison between the Soviet Government and Wolffs Bureau.Certain prominent members of the Western European Secretariat of Propaganda are reported to have recently asked Lutovinoff to induce the Soviet to increase the yearly subsidy from 1,500,000 to 3,000,000 marks. Lutovinoff promised to submit their request to the Executive Committee
of the Third International as well as to the Soviet, hut intimated that the work of the Secretariat would bo expected to show correspondiug results. (Stimulated by the local success which has attended travelling cinema propaganda of the Third International and its ideas, the Soviet is having a large number of motor cinemas manufactured for propaganda abroad. If possible, everyone attending the Congress of the Third International was to be given an apparatus. &quot; Izvestia &quot; hints that this method of propaganda in India, Persia, Central Asia and Asia Minor does not contravene the spirit of the agreement with England, as it is a new discovery which was not foreseen.The Movements of Krassin.As was reported last month, Krassin left England for Moscow on July 8th. His departure is said to have no direct connection with the Constantinople incident, but to have been caused by his difficult relations with Moscow. For some time it has been impossible for Krassin to obtain sufficient funds to carry on the purely commercial business of his commission, and the instructions given him have been of the vaguest description. New men have been coming from Moscow to take the place of Krassin&apos;s trusted agents, and now Berzin has been sent from Helsingfors to exercise a sort of control over Krassin&apos;s activities.During the crossing from Dover to Ostend ou his way to Moscow, Krassiu told a Belgian journalist that the Soviet had not yet decided upon the denationalisation of industries except in case of small factories employing less than 50 hands. He said that the American Westinghouse Company had taken possession of its two factories on conditions similar to those existing before the revolution.Krassin has stated in an interview that the Soviet is at present devoting its attention to the purchase abroad of foodstuffs and seeds for winter crops. It is possible that in the immediate future the Soviet will succeed in floating a loan in France. By the end of this year (?) negotiations with foreign firms concerning concessions will be com-pleted. Locomotives, of which the Soviet has bought 500 in Germany and 100 in Sweden, will begin to arrive in August, and by the end of the year all those ordered will be at the disposal of the Soviet.The Third International, is reported to have instructed Krassin to give both moral and material support to all strike movements in Groat Britain, with the ulterior object of swelling the scanty ranks of the Communist Party by an accession of the unemployed and discontented. With tho same object of furthering the success of the Communist move-meut the International has taken the necessary steps to support Sinn Fein. As was to be anticipated, Krasshrs organisation has denied the authenticity of this manifesto.Krassiu&apos;s present plan is to start for London on August 20th, hut he may postpone his journey if Mr. Urquhart accepts the invitation to visit Moscow in order to confer with him.Trade Matters.Kopp has stated that the Soviet intends to start its experiments in reconstruction by reviving the industry of Petrograd. It is moved thereto by the accessibility of Petrograd to West European control, and its geographical position, which facilitates communication with Germany. G-ermany is regarded by the Soviet as the main factor in reconstruction. Kopp suggests that the metal industry, turned over to peaceful ends, will first be restored through a Russo-German Corporation.   The textiled 2
industry, helped by Italian capital, will follow. Kopp and his govern -raent will eliminate English capital as far as possible. For strategic reasons, the war industry wjdl be transported to some place in the interior of the country.- Negotiations are reported to be proceeding with regard to the transfer to foreigners of five important Petrograd factories to be worked as concessions. Armstrong-Whitworth, Creuzot, Krupps, and Hugo Stinnes are understood to be negotiating Armstrong-Whitworth for the well-known Putilov works and Krupps for the Obukhovsky works.A Helsingfors. report has it that the Soviet has decided to give the Petrograd harbour concession to Englishmen. Half the shares in the proposed company will be held by Englishmen, the other half by the Soviet Authorities.The Soviet is reliably reported to have recently purchased two banks, one in Bucharest and the other in Warsaw, for the purpose of financial operations and propaganda. The Warsaw bank is said to be that belonging to the firm of Wolensky, a very shady person, and dealing chiefly in lottery tickets and shares. It is anticipated that the premises will be used as headquarters for Bolshevik propaganda in Poland.In connection with the stoppage of the purchase of food stuffs in Hamburg, Koubinin, of the Soviet Commissariat for Foreign Trade in Germany, has Written to Krassin pointing out that certain kinds of food, such as lard and beans, may be bought in Hamburg at a cheaper rate than in England, and stating that he is astonished by Krassin&apos;s saying that the Hamburg prices were too high.Soviet imports for May amounted to 7,932,051 poods. The share of England 27 &quot;8 per cent. was the largest.The first German engines, it is reported, may be delivered in Petrograd by the beginning of September.A further assessment puts the gold reserve in Russia at 252,000,000 roubles in bars and coin. The jewellery and valuables in the possession of the Soviet are put at the high arid probably exaggerated figure of 650,000,000 roubles.A Strange Deal.Curious transactions which took place in London during June appear to point to the fact that Peter Miller, cypher clerk at the Bolshevik Trade Delegation, and Jules Grosjean, an official Soviet courier, who left for russia on June 21st, took with them 60,000/. of English currency and 2,360,000 odd French francs. It is virtually certain that this money sent by couriers in. the company of British delegates to the Congress of tho Third International and of the International of lied Trade Unions, was intended for distribution to the delegates from different countries to these congresses. The British currency will more probably be used in tho East; the French currency in Europe. The method of subsidising revolution is fairly clear. Soviet gold is sold to Swedish banks, given the Swedish stamp and sold in America. The proceeds are credited to members of the Delegation in London, who employ an intermediary to buy French and British currency, which is then sent to Moscow for distri-bution to the delegates of the two Internationals.Miscellaneous.Alexander Kerensky is reported to be still receiving funds from the Zimmerwald group.It is announced that persons younger than 18 years of age are not permitted to attend classes or lectures on religious subjects.
In spite of rumours to the contrary, Lunacharsky still remains People&apos;s Commissary for Education, nor does bis dismissal appear to be likely.Schaliapin is said to have been refused hitherto permission to leave Russia, owing to the reluctance of artists who leave the country to return to it. Schaliapin receives lai&apos;ge food supplies and a salary of 1,000,000 roubles a day.One Leonidas Nadegine, ou landing in England to join the Trade Delegation in London, assured a certain gentleman that Russia would never see him again and that this was the real feeling and intention of nearly the whole of the entourage gathering round Krassin in London.The Left Poale Zion Party has addressed a manifesto to the world proletariat, calling upon it to fight against the policy of the Zionists in England &quot; who work hand in hand with the British Imperialists.&quot; The excesses at Jaffa are set down as the work of the British Government.A member of the Bolshevik Central Executive Committee has dis-covered that the Forest Department at Kostroma allocates 15,000 roubles monthly for the support of a cat to keep down the mice. This is 1,500 roubles monthly more than the aggrieved Communist himself gets.The Finnish Professor Igelstrom stated that Maxim Gorky has been allowed to form an organisation in Petrograd called &quot; The Commission for Improving the Conditions of Professors.&quot; Professors will be allowed to send abroad their books, paintings, and other results of their works, so that they may obtain some money with which to live.A report is current that the Bolsheviks intend to attempt the circula-tion of large numbers of cleverly forged British Treasury notes in England. A story, which is not easily credible, has it that a member of Krassin&apos;s Mission engaged men from the place where the Treasury notes are printed anil sent them to Russia, together with samples of the paper.Multiplying its Internationals, Moscow has now conceived schemes for forming an International of clerks, public and private secretaries, shop assistants, and smaller officials, to be called the &quot; Public and Private Officials&apos;International&quot; ; a Teachers&apos;International ; an International of Sporting Associations, and an Artists&apos; International. All these organisations are to be controlled by and affiliated with the Third International.FINLAND.Relations with Russia.Marklevski has been appointed Soviet representative at Helsingfors in the place of Berzin, who has gone to England.The Russo-Finnish Committee which is dealing with the Peace Treaty is said to have suspended its . meetings owing to differences of opinion, especially regarding Karelia aud Finnish claims to property&apos; in Russia. The Finnish and Soviet Governments aro to settle the matter between them., The Russian section of the Union of Metal Workers appears to have been told by the Bolshevik Delegation that in the event of any repressions the Delegation would, support it, even to the extent of creating a political incident.The Russian Soviet authorities make, it is said, strenuous. efforts to induce Finns to join the Communist Party with a view to preventing their return to Finland. Converted Finns are used as couriers to Finland, as only members of the Communist Party are trusted for this work.
The Plot in Sweden.The Finnish police are said to suspect that the Bolshevik plot dis-covered in Sweden extends to Finland. They have found certain &quot; lines of communication &quot; to Russia, some oC which pass through Sweden, The discoveries made in Sweden are not new to the Finnish authorities, who have long been aware of the links between the active Communists in Finland, the Red Finns in Sweden, and tho Swedish Communists.The Prospects oi Russian Trade.The Finnish Trade Delegation to Moscow returned, during June, thoroughly disillusioned. The members advised Finnish industrialists to make no attempt to open up any sort of trade with Russia, in view of the chaos in that country and the impossibility of doing business with the officials of the Soviet Departments of Trade and Commerce. These officials are remarkable for their ignorance and impertinence.In the meantime it is reported from Helsingfors that a new Finnish Trade Delegation of five members has been appointed for Russia.The Bolshevik Trade Delegation, under Ignatieff, is said to have signed a contract with a Danish firm, Schilling Anderson, for the immo-diate delivery of land to the value of 2,500,000 Finnish marks. Ignatieff is about to sign a contract with the Finnish Paper Trust for the delivery of paper to Soviet Russia to the value of 30,000,000 Finnish marks.Miscellaneous.Agents of Hugo Stinnes are now examining the Finnish forests-Stinnes&apos; real aim is reported to be the establishment of German influence at Pechenga, which is both a port and a convenient place for developing the timber industry.Baltic States. ESTHONIA.A Bribe from Russia.In its anxiety to maintain its influence in Esthonia, the Soviet Government is said to have secretly offered Esthonia a district in the Petrograd Government on condition that Esthonia does not join the Baltic alliance. This area will be officially handed over as compensation for the timber concessions promised to Estliouia under the Dorpat Peace Treaty.Miscellaneous.The Moscow wireless announces that the Esthonian Government has passed a law forbidding all Communist literature.The Bolshevik Legation has deceived from Moscow great quantities of jewels, which are to bo sold for food.&quot;Victor Kingisepp is reported to have been in Stockholm under.a false name. He intended to go to Switzerland later, to discuss with Piatten and Humbert-Droz the possibility of organising terrorism throughout the world.After a brief stay in Reval, Litvinoff has again returned to Moscow. Leonid Stark has also left for Moscow, where he has been appointed Chief of the Transport Section of the Commissariat for Foreign Trade. Shenshev has been appointed Delegation Secretary in place of Adolph Guy (Gay).
LATVIA.Relations with Russia.Ganetsky, the Soviet emissary in Latvia, has communicated a verbose note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, protesting against unfriendly&apos; acts alleged to have been committed by the late Government. The soviet&apos;s grievances are the refusal of the Lettish Government to abide faithfully by the economic clauses, of the Letto-Russian Peace Treaty, the arrest of local Communists and subsequent procedure in this con-nection. The Soviet appears to be particularly annoyed at obstacles placed by the Letts in the way of Russian transit trade through Latvia, and at the refusal to permit the use of Russian labour in Lettish ports. The note ends with veiled throats, and a warning that the Soviet Govern-ment will not permit the Letts to trample on the Treaty. Ganetsky has , since been recalled from Latvia, and is replacing Tikhomirsky at Teheraii. Kosinatov from Reval succeeds Ganetsky, Alexandrin remaining in Kosmatov&apos;s service and continuing his task of propaganda among the Lettish troops.The chief of the Latvia Political Police has expressed himself unper-disturbed at the rumours of a Russian attack upon Latvia, considering the internal difficulties under which- Russia labours,Anti-British Propaganda.In pursuance of his present special ends of intensive propaganda for England, directed towards the masses of the trade unions and. all ex-Service. men&apos;s organisations, Joffe appears to be seeking someone who would write out articles and speeches in English. Joffe has stated that propaganda is to be concentrated along the Afghanistan border, Turkey and England. He has also said that when the time comes Colonel Malone is to be in command of the Red Army in England.Before his recall Ganetsky is said to have been instructed to help the courier Kondrakov on his arrival to obtain the necessary documents&apos; for getting to Belfast. It should be stated that some doubt is cast on the authenticity of this information..Miscellaneous.The chief of the Political Defence, after his first interview with Mr. Kvesis, the new Minister of the Interior, stated that there will be practically no change in policy as regards repressive measures against Communist agents.It is feared that a difficult situation may arise when the 200,000 refugee optants for Lettish nationality arrive during the next three months. Serious unemployment, with consequent dangers to the preser--vation of order, is feared.Isidor Gukovsky is said still to be in prison in Moscow awaiting trial for the embezzlement of State moneys while he was chief of the Soviet Trade Delegation in Reval.......LITHUANIA.Internal. Affairs.Discontent is reported to be growing amongst the rank and file of the army, and cases of desertion&apos;are frequent. The tightening of-discipline and the delay in settling the Vilna question, which hinders demobilisation, are chiefly responsible for the unrest. ........ ,.:      v
The Soeial Democrat press continues to protest against the sentences of death passed on some. 25 Communists by the Lithuanian Military Tribunal, and the Party has exhorted tho Government to take care. The possible fate of Lithuanians in Russia has been mentioned by Social Democrats in the Seini.As a result of the Lithuanian Governments refusal to release Communist agents arrested at Kovno, the First Secretary of the Lithuanian Mission at Moscow, Svontkovsky, was placed under arrest.Girinis, who was recently expelled from Lithuania, is said to have proposed the formation of a Baltic Section of the Communist Trade Union International, at a private meeting of representatives from Esthonia, Latvia and Lithuania, held in conjunction with the Third International.Moscow is responsible for a statement that the Seini has passed a special amendment to the Land Law, directed, according to the inter-pretation of the Social Democrats, against the possibility of allotting land to Communists.The Insurance of Russian Gold.The firm of T. Clayhill and Sons, formerly British, now German, with which that of Oscar Stude &amp; Co. is incorporated, is said to undertake the insurance of Russian gold sent abroad, most of which is shipped in the firm&apos;s vessels. ScheePs Bank and Clayhill and Sons have agreements with the Soviet Government and between themselves, by which Scheel conducts all the financial transactions of the Soviet Trade Delegation. The gold is insured through a local company and on its safe arrival the Soviet Delegation pay 10 per cent., on which OlayhhTs make a profit of 5?j to 6 per cent. Stude&apos;s handle all gold arriving at Reval for transit to Russia, and a bloc of large German firms monopolises the transit trade to Russia, both financially and in handling the goods.A Curious Concern.A certain Count Vassilli Dimitviev -Mamonoff, who is surrounded with a certain mystery, has managed to find the money which Lithuania needed to. pay to Germany in return for permission to open a bank in Lithuania. From this establishment, whose operations resemble, on a large scale, those of a pawnshop, Lithuania receives one-third of the profits, the Jewish friends of Mamonoff another third, and Mamonoff himself the last third which he says is for use in fighting Bolshevism. The Lithuanian Government has benefited to the extent of 15,000,000 roubles. Mamonoff, who has close connections with Elvengren, appears formerly to have been attached to the personal chancery of the Empress Dowager of Russia.POLAND. Strained Relations with Russia.The extraordinary note addressed early in July to the Polish Govern-ment by Tchitcherin is looked upon in some quarters as a deliberate attempt to provoke a new war. The note roundly accuses the Polish Government of encouraging Saviokoff, Petlura, and others to foment insurrections in Russia and of itself organising detachments of Russian troops to fight Communism. It demands the immediate expulsion from Poland aud the disarmament of the alleged anti-Communist Russian
detachments, as well as. tho formation of a mixed Polish-Russian Corn-mission which is to draw up a list of persons to be banished and to superintend the execution of the Soviet demands, including the punish-mcnt of &quot; official persons and other Polish citizens.&quot; The note, goes so far as to allege that Polish agents have smuggled poison into Moscow for a mass assassination of Commissars. Warsaw has replied refuting the various accusations in detail, and making countercharges against the Soviet, which is declared to maintain a school for training Polish Communist agitators in Moscow, and to have organised Ruthenian and White Russian detachments to make raids across the Polish border.Probably behind tho Soviet note lies a great distaste against the payment of 30,000,000 gold roubles stipulated by the Riga Treaty. The treasure chests of the Soviet are very low. Moscow does not want to fight, but would gladly find some excuse for deferring an obnoxious payment.The Moscow wireless claims that the Soviet has discovered and thwarted an anti-Russian plot hatched at Warsaw by the Russian Political Committee, headed by Savinkoff&apos;. The complicity of the Polish Govern-ment is alleged.Labour Unrest.Much labour trouble, largely the result of Bolshevik propaganda carried on by the Soviet Repatriation Delegation, is expected in Warsaw. The Polish workmen are under singular delusions as to the state of labour in Russia. Other factors making for trouble are the collapse of tho Polish mark and the increase in the cost lof living. The first strike expected is that of the municipal, workmen, who demand a 50 per cent, increase of wages. It seems that the &quot;Society of Self-Support&quot; will not be able to take over the duties of the municipal workers as it did last year, a fact which is encouraging the men. The threatened general strike, which was to have started on July 1st, has not yet taken effect.Miscellaneous.A branch office for Communist propaganda has been opened at Danzig, charged specially with the care of deportees arriving at the port. It will also be responsible for propaganda amongst foreign seamen.It has been decided to take 5,000 Cossacks into the Polish Army, under the command of Polish generals, the colonels and other officers being Russians. Colonel Gnilorybotf, who is on the Savinkoff Committee and who is also a member of the Supreme Council of the Union for the Defence of the Fatherland and Liberty, will be attached to the Polish Government, as representative of the Don Cossacks at present in Poland.   He will still remain a member of the Savinkoff organisations.5. BALKAN AND EAST EUROPEAN STATES. GREECE.The Soviet and Greece.In answer to Tchitcherin&apos;s inquiry by wireless whether Greece has declared war against the Russian Soviet, M. Gounaris replied that Greece was simply making war on Kemal and had no intention of declaring war against Russia.The Russian Soviet has since expressed its willingness to send a delegation to Greece and to receive a Greek delegation in Russia in order
to effect the repatriation of the nationals of tho respective countries. The Soviet is ready to resume commercial relations with G recce.A Communist Intriguer.Drama, in Eastern Macedonia, is one of the main Communist centres in Northern Greece. Lconides Pavlides, editor of rabidly Communist local paper, directs activities hero. Pavlides is a Cypriot, who has lived&apos; many years in Switzerland, has been connected with the doubtful Ukrainian Mission in Athens, and lies under suspicion of being concerned in Gorman propaganda. He frequently makes propagandist tours in Macedonia, and is said to be instructed and financed by the Soviet Government.JUGO-SLAVIA.The Terrorist Movement: Stern Measures 01 Repression.Tho attempt to assassinate the Crown Prince Regent on June 29th has led to the arrest of three Communist members of the Assembly, Filipovic, Copic and Kavacevic. Kavacevic proves to have been with Stejic, the author of the attempt, the leading spirit of the Belgrade Communist Central. Other arrests have taken place at Novisad.. Stejic himself has stated that he obtained his orders from the three Communist deputies mentioned, and that the original plan had been for bombs to be thrown in the Constituent Assembly as well. This, however, was abandoned, as it was impossible to obtain admission to the Assembly for the two would-be authors of the outrage. A later avowal by Stejic is that he received his orders in the Communist Club of the Constituent Assembly.Nothing definite can yet be said as to the complicity of the three Communist members. There seems to be no doubt that a communistic organisation exists, with its base at Novisad, but whether it is merely anti-national or associated with Moscow for the purpose of giving effect to subversive schemes, is not so far established. Opinion generally inclines to the latter belief, which is strengthened by the discovery that the Communist Committee of Novisad, who seem to have comprised the Communist Executive of Belgrade, maintained fairly close connection with the Central Communist Committee in Vienna. Various discoveries have gone to strengthen the connection between the arrested deputies and the terrorist organisation at Novisad. The outrage is alleged to have . been prepared in Vienna. It may perhaps be taken that the terrorist movement is morally of Russian origin, but is . nevertheless anti-national in that it seems to take its origin mainly in a part of Yugo-Slavia which is ex-enemy territory, and liable still to maintain a considerable discontented elemeut.Another dastardly act of terrorism is the assassination of tho Minister of the Interior, M. Drashkovitch, who was shot dead at Delniee on July 21st by a Communist, a young Mohammedan Bosnian carpenter, named Aliya Aliazic. It was M. Drashkovitch who exposed&apos; in the Assembly a Bolshevist plot in Yugo-Slavia, as has been mentioned in the Review.The Government has been moved to drastic action. Already, before the murder of M. Drashkovitch, the Belgrade &quot; Tribune,&quot; the organ of M. Pasitch, published an inspired communication, foreshadowing au attempt to obtain from the Austrian Government the expulsion of the Communist organisations which shelter in Vienna and thence direct plots in the Balkan States. It appeared that Yugo-Slavia would ask in a- friendly manner for the expulsion-from Vienna of the Soviet envoy and the chief&apos;
of his underlings. The Yugo-Siav Government is considering a.project for an international convention against the Bolsheviks, on the linos of the international agreements already existing against the Anarchists.The new Bill for the protection of the State is understood to provide for the dissolution of the Communist party and the annulment of the. mandates of the Communist Deputies of tho Skupstina. All communist, anarchist, or terrorist propaganda and all agitation for a change in the form of the State will be prohibited. Thoso guilty of such offences are. punishable by death or by 20 years&apos; imprisonment. The same penalties will be visited on those who aid the Communist press, incite to mutiny in tho Army, &amp;c. 3,000 suspects have been arrested, many trade union papers suppressed, and several Wholesale Co-operatives, in which Left Wing Socialists dominate, temporarily dissolved.There are not wanting allegations in circles favoured by Moscow that the recent attempt on the life of the Regent Alexander was a fraud perpetrated by the Government for political purposes.The Internal Situation.It appears to have been settled that a revolution was to be brought about in Yugo-Shivia in June, which was to spread in time to Eoumania, Czecho-Slovakia, and Bulgaria. An extensive re-arrangement of Balkan frontiers was to follow, benefiting Serbia&apos;s former enemies at Serbia&apos;s expense. Tho manner in which, the lion&apos;s share of the spoil was to be disposed of gives reason to suppose that tho scheme was of il ungarian origin. Various discoveries go to strengthen.the connection between the arrested Communist deputies and the terrorist organisation at Novi-sad.Only the Radical Coalition is said now to oppose the Separatist aud Hapsburg movement, which has made very rapid strides of late. All other parties are more or less united in aiming at some form of decent-tralisation. /Die popular discontent has been exploited by Communist agitators, and Yngo-Slav Communism, which has no close connection with Moscow, has come to represent the various elements discontented with the present Government. The Communist Party has been partially suppressed in Serbia and works much abroad. Secret branches in America supply most of the funds of the Separatist movement, for which over 2,000,000 dollars are said to have been collected.BULGARIA.The St. Boris&apos; Day Outrage : Strange Statements.The outrage on St. Boris&apos; Day, when, as has ,already been stated, a small bomb was thrown among a procession of school children, appears to have been designed-to embarrass the Government. Rumours continue that the crime was inspired directly or indirectly by tbe Government, as a pretext for- the use of extreme repressive measures against the Com-munist Party. Replying to a Communist interpellation, Stamboulisky said that there was very little difference between Communists and Anarchists, and the people had the right to fight against both. He added the singular statement that the danger did not come from the Communists, but from the &quot;old parties.&quot; &quot; It is against the bourgeois that we must direct all our strength.&quot; - He advised the Communists not to regret too much the burning down of their club, which would serve as a voucher for Lenin, in return for which he would send money to build a far finer and more commodious building. The Sobranje finally voted a resolution condemning both the crime and the excesses which followed it, and calling on the Government to take all necessary steps to arrest the
culprits. The Communists, together with the Macedonian Society, have informed tho Government that they know the name and the where-abouts of the author of the bomb-throwing outrage, who is alleged to be an associated Agrarian in the pay of the police. &quot; Sensational revelations &quot; are threatened if the Government do not at once arrest the assassin.Miscellaneous.M. Stamboulisky has publicly denied rumours of Bulgarian intrigues with Moscow and Angora, and nothing is said to be known of tho alleged Bolshevist mission at Varna, but Major Yankoff, son of tho revolutionary Colonel Yankoff, who was killed in 1903, is said to have offered arms to Jevad Abas Bey for the Nationalist Turks. Jevad appears to be pleased with the work of the Bolshevik agitators, who are trying to induce officers and men of Wrangefs army to join the Bolsheviks, either for service in Thrace or in Constantinople.Dr. Christo Kilifarsky, the leader of the Russian Communists in the Varna district, is said to be secretly negotiating with the Bulgarian Government for the purchase of old Turkish and Russian rifles. One version of the tale gives Ireland as their destination.ROUMANIA.Communism under a Cloud.There is corroboration of the statement that the extreme Socialists are for the present discredited, and that the moderate elements are gaining in influence and are re-organising the party on lines of legitimate activity. The extremist elements are probably to be found among the Communists who drifted to the country after the fall of Bela Kun, among the prisoners who have returned from Russia, and among the numerous malcontents, who will probably lessen as conditions in the country improve. What Communist movement exists is likely to have been fostered by foreign elements, but it is difficult to judge how far the tendency to ascribe all its manifestations to disguised irredentism is justified.The present evil fortune of extremism is borne witness to by a remarkable letter written in prison by Hie Moscovioi, former secretary of the Extreme Socialists. For obvious reasons the letter was not read, as Moscovici intended, at the Socialist Congress in Bucharest. Moscovici violently arraigns all his former partisans, complains bitterly of his treatment at the Congress, which his imprisonment prevented him from attending, and asks the working classes of the whole of Greater Roumania not to follow the men whom they have hitherto supported. The letter is characteristic of the decomposition that has set in. The growing impotence of the party is emphasised by the fact that a Socialist Congress held at Ploesti, the centre of the petroleum region, refused affiliation to the Third International. Grigorovici, a Bukovinian, and leader of the moderate fraction of the Socialist Party, who came to the front at this Congress is gaining ground, and is the probable Socialist leader of the future.Communist Plots.Communist plots are becoming increasingly frequent in Bessarabia and in Moldavia. Many Bolshevik envoys succeed in crossing the Dniester, evading the guards.
The Press has published a report, bearing evident signs of inspiration, concerning a Communist plot recently discovered at Cluj, and said to be the fourth of the kind. The plot is said to have been directed by the Communist Party in Vienna, which in turn received orders from Moscow ; it aimed at destroying the present social order and substituting a dictatorship of the proletariat by means of excesses of all kinds and executions en masse. The Communist centre at Cluj is said to have made all arrangements for the declaration of affiliation to the Third International and the 21 articles approved at the Socialist Congress at Budapest.6. NEAR EASTERN STATES. TURKEY.Angora and Communism.The Angora Government, which pledged itself to permit a free propaganda of Communism in Turkey, and not to put any obstacles in the way of the organisation of a Turkish Communist Party, appears to have outwitted Moscow by creating an official Communist Party of its own under the leadership of an Angora notable, Haki Behidj Bey. The new party received the sole right to expound Communism in Angora, and the only missionaries tolerated were provided with official certificates by the party. Moscow and Baku were furious and despatched two propaganda missions which were received with insults, ill-treatment, and imprisonment. Mustapha Selhi, the leader of the Baku Mission, was murdered, doubtless with the approval, if not the direct connivance of, the Turkish authorities. But even this drew no protest from Moscow, always ready to fulminate against the &quot; persecution &quot; of Communists in Esthonia or Latvia.A distinct tension is reported to exist between Nationalists and Bolsheviks in the Trebizond area. A Soviet Consulate and a Bolshevik Information Bureau exist at Trebizond, and these, though independent of one another, conduct an active Bolshevik propaganda, which the Nationalists are vigorously seeking to counteract, not without success. Their method is to publish reports from Turks who have returned from Russia regarding the terrible conditions in that country. Nearly all the members of the former Hill Government of tho North Caucasus are just now at Trebizond. They are trying to win support for an independent Hill Republic under the protection of Turkey, but Angora is distracted from this scheme by pressing affairs nearer home.These facts may account for ZinoviefFs outburst concerning Turkey ou the last day of the Communist&apos; International, at which Angora pro-fesses bewilderment. Zinovieff accused the Angora Government of bitter hostility to Communism, and. described it as a government of Pashas as tyrannical as former Sultans who persecuted and often murdered Communists while professing their friendship to the Soviet.Present Relations with Russia. ,The intention of the Bolsheviks to concentrate their main force on the Turkish frontier, and particularly in the neighbourhood of Batum, is considered to be due to a desire to increase their moral influence over the Turks by means of a strong display of force, and a wish to support Enver Pasha, their new protege, should such a course commend itself. The ostensible policy of the Soviet has been indicated by Tchitcherin, who is reported to have informed the Turkish and Russian political and military chiefs at the beginning of June that Moscow was closely
minterested in current events in the Near East, though at present debarred from active participation in them. Present assistance to Turkey would be confined to military and technical help from the stocks in the Caucasus. Russia might, however, bo drawn into the struggle unwillingly, and therefore it had been decided to effect a junction of the Red Army forces now in Trans-Caucasia and on the Turkish frontier. Some units would remain in tho neighbourhood of Jnlfa, whence it would be possible, if necessary, to divert the attention of the British by the threat of an advance south, into Persia.The real designs of the Soviet appear to be quite other. Mustapha Kemal&apos;s lip service to Communism may have been accepted by the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, but the pressure of the Third International lias been too strong and it seems to have been decided to give all possible help to Enver Pasha. Enver is reported to be now in the&apos; Southern Caucasus preparing a coup d&apos;etat at Angora, and he may have, if necessary, the support of the Red troops massed on the Turkish border. The Afghan delegates, during their visit to Berlin, are said to have stated that Enver is trying to secure Bolshevik help for a vast Pan-Islamic campaign, in all. Mohammedan countries, and is also trying to raise an army in Kabul and Persia. The Communist International is reported to have instructed the Council of Action and Propaganda at Baku to assist Enver in every way a policy which indicates the undermining of Mustapha Kemal&apos;s influence, in realisation that his tolerance of Communism cannot be counted upon indefinitely.As has frequently been insisted upon, the Soviet knows that the alliance with Mustapha Kemal is very artificial and that complications with Turkey are possible. There is no doubt that the Bolsheviks intended to use the Nationalists as a weapon so long as a weapon was necessary and then to sovietise them by the ordinary process of internal disorganisation. But the Oriental duplicity of the Nationalists has reversed the position. It is they, so far, who have used the Bolsheviks, and the Russians have no illusions as to the real light in which Com-mnnisrn is viewed by Mahommedans. Whether the present passive dislike is to become active may largely depend upon the military fortunes of the Kemalists, as of course also on factors introduced by the present uncertainties in Russia.In this connection it was reported at the end of July that the Angora Assembly had ratified, by 202 votes against one, the Kemalist Treaty with Moscow. The Treaty recognises Kars and Ardahau as belonging toi Turkey and Batoum to Georgia, together with a Customs franchise for Turkish products imported into Batoum. The Nationalist Govern-ment has disowned Bekir Sami Bey and Avif Bey. Meanwhile, General Brusiloff is said to have arrived at Angora and the Soviet is also stated to be choosing Moslem soldiers as reinforcements for the Kemalists.In an interview with the Paris correspondent of the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; Bekir Sami remarked that the Russians were neighbours with whom the Turks wished to live in peace and amity, and there was no question of agreement with the political principles of the Soviet Government.Dr. Reshad Nihad has stated that the authorities in Moscow continue to press Kemal for a complete break with the Western powers. Kemal felt, however, that to agree to this would finish Turkey as a State in the eyes of Europe and America, and he relied on Bekir Sami to reach an agreement.On the other hand, Trotsky is said to have suggested to Angora that an attitude of hostility to the European Powers should be abandoned. The Nationalists were advised to constitute a Turkish State within ethnical limits and with a capital at Brussa.   The discussion of this
communication caused a- violent scene in the Grand Assembly, ending in free fights and revolver shots.   Twenty deputies were arrested.A Revolt in Konia.The Greek military successes appear to have been followed by a revolutionary movement in the Konia district, where many villages have revolted. A Turkish sect, known as Kizilbash, disgusted with Kemalist repressions and exactions, heads the revolt. The insurgent villagers are said to have decided to obey only tho authority of tho Sultan, and to have elected as chief Said Hilmi Bey, a faithful adherent of the Sultan. They have occupied Konia with little resistance, and proclaimed the revolutionary Government. Many of the Kemulist troops are reported to have joined the insurgents.The Raid on the Bolshevik Delegation.The moral effect of the recent arrests in Constantinople was extra-ordinary, both among Russian elements and tho Turkish population. It has produced a wholesome respect for those who took action. The activities of the remaining Bolshevik organisations have been stopped and many suspects have departed. The Beikos Communist Committee has transferred its centre to Yenikeui, where there are indications of a small group having been formed under the auspices of Sarah Kaplun. Agitation and propaganda among Russians has ceased altogether.The &quot; Daily Herald&quot; is responsible for the statement that the source of the.: information, which resulted iu the arrest of the Soviet Trade Delegation, is General Wrangel&apos;s staff, which still maintains a bureau in Constantinople.,Constantinople business circles state that Kuznetzov has had 65,000,000 francs placed at his disposal by the Soviet. Kudish made no commercial deals, but Kuznetzov has started business with several firms.The Beikos Committee&apos;s Activities.The Bolshevik Committee at Beikos, which was established before the arrival of the official Trade Delegation, had become one of the most dangerous Bolshevik organisations in Constantinople. Its activities were twofold on the one hand it fed Angora with reports tending to incline the Nationalists still further towards Bolshevism ; on the other hand, it exaggerated locally whatever Bolshevik tendencies might be apparent at Angora. It worked and still has ramifications among all nationalities in Constantinople. The president of the Beikos Coni-mittee is a. certain Staso, alias Stcnkevitch, a Pole previously employed by the Bolsheviks in the Crimea.Miscellaneous.A strong prejudice against Indians is reported to exist at present among all Turks.The activities of the Egyptian colony in Constantinople go little beyond occasional meetings. The colony is in rooted opposition to Abbas Hilmi, the ex-Khedive, and his claim, and adheres to Zaghloul Pasha and the extreme Nationalists.The arrival is reported in Constantinople from Trebizond of a Communist, Ibrahim-Bek-Musabekov, who was instructed to get into touch with one Atabashian, &amp; &quot; business man,&quot; whose business is, however, entirely supported by Soviet funds. Musabekov- will work under the name of &quot;Nikolai Belkonov&quot; at the tasks of terror and anarchy assigned to him, including attempts against the Allied and
Russian representatives in Constantinople. a Pole named Mikulsky works with Musabokov and Atabashian ; he controls the funds and supports the organisation, which has branches in Anatolia, Alexandria and Cairo, and proposes to open branches in Naples, Tunis, and Damascus. All Soviet agents arriving in Constantinople must report to Musabekov, who arranges meetings for them with Mikulsky.EGYPT.Bolshevik Designs.In Egypt the Bolsheviks are coquetting with the extremists. Humours have been circulated, probably inspired&apos; by the notorious Bolshevik, Joseph Rosenthal, that a Soviet Trade Delegation is coming to Egypt. Rosen thai, in fact, avowed his hope that one of the results of the arrival of the delegation would be his own nomination as Soviet representative.The elements in Egypt upon which Bolshevism may work in pursuit of its anti-British aims include the labour syndicates, the extremist Egyptians in:Egypt and abroad, the Turkish and Pan-Islamic elements in touch with the Bolsheviks, the Bolshevik agents reported to be converging on Egypt from A.ngora, Berlin and Moscow, the avowed , Bolsheviks in the country itself, and the Third International as a centre in Alexandria.The activities of the club known as &quot; Groupe d&apos;Etudes Sociales,&quot; founded at Alexandria in 1920, have grown considerably of late. A feminist element has been introduced, and Joseph Rosenthal and other agitators have also come in. The members of the club are now openly Communist, and the title is a mere mask. A like club exists at Cairo under the direction of the brothers .Stavrinou.Miscellaneous.It is announced that Prince Aziz Hassan was expelled on account of his developing Communist, activities. He seems to have imbibed his revolutionary ideas at Barcelona during the war.Anxiety has been allayed by the discovery that the man arrested in Upper Egypt is not Zaki el Tcherkessi, a Bolshevik agent and deputy of the Angora Government, who was reported some time ago to be on his way to Egypt, to make an agreement with Zaghloul for the propagation of Bolshevik principles amongst the Egyptians. The prisoner is an undesirable Turkish student, impersonating Zaki el Tcherkessi for criminal ends.PERSIA. Bolshevik Military Movements.The Bolsheviks have re-occupied Kesht, where Rothstein is directing anti-British propaganda. The maintenance of a Bolshevik force on the Persian frontier is said to be due to both strategic and economic reasons strategic because troops in the Enzeli and Resht areas can be easily moved in&apos; any direction, and especially into Persia ; economic because the presence of troops in these areas will ensure the maximum export of food supplies from Persia.The Intrigues of Rothstein.Rothstein is reported to have consolidated his position in Teheran by careful flattery of Persian customs and class divisions. He has employed Persian Armenians to run the native press in Teheran and to get into touch with the nomadic tribes whose support is necessary for any Persian Government in the North.   Rothstein believes that he has now won over
these tribes, and that time is ripe i&apos;or a decisive stop in consolidating the, ephemeral Persian Soviet Republic proclaimed last year in the province of Ghilan. Rothstein sees in this a chance of obtaining by requisitions food for the starving population of Baku and for the Red troops on the Persia frontier.The Red Flag was hoisted for the first time over the Soviet Legation towards the end of June. Rothstein celebrated the occasion by an entertainment surpassing in brilliance any party given in the days of the Tsar.7. CENTRAL ASIATIC STATES. CENTRAL ASIA. GEORGIA.The Bolshevik Stranglehold.Bolshevik control has been tightening of late, and numbers of Men-sheviks have been arrested. The Bolsheviks have been removing all stocks of railway material from Trans-Caucasia into Russia, an action which has greatly strained the relations between the Georgian and the Russian Communists. Realising that oil is practically the only com-commodity that they can offer the outside world for barter, the Bolsheviks are doing all they can to increase the output of the Baku oilfields. All technical machinery is beiug requisitioned and all persons with technical experience are being mobilised for work.Meanwhile, Russlfication proceeds steadily. The policy is very much like that pursued under the Tsardom, but scorpions have succeeded the whips of those days. The country is being systematically pillaged, and all forms of wealth are being carried away to Russia. Georgians are everywhere dismissed, aud tbe Bolshevik officials mock at Georgian claims to nationality and independence. All Georgian books are destroyed. But food is the question of all others, and it has risen to incredible prices. Except the officials and the Russian soldiers, the whole population appears to be starving, and the most ardent patriots think more of a crust than of freedom.There is bitter irony in the decision of the Executive of the hated Second International to support a request made by the Social Democratic Party in Tiflis that a mixed Commission representing the Socialist and Communist parties of the rest of the world should be appointed to superintend the takiug of a free vote of the Georgian electorate as to what form of government is desired by the majority. Through Ramsay Macdonald, Krassin has been asked to communicate this resolution to the Soviet and to ask what is their view upon it.Miscellaneous.The German Mission at Tiflis is said to be occupied chiefly in study-ing economic conditions in the Trans-Caucasus, and the possibilities of German trade there.   The Germans have vigorous rivals in the Italians.The organisation of the Red Army, which General Maznieff still commands, progresses slowly, owing chiefly to the undesirability of taking away agricultural labour from the fields. A total of 36,000 is aimed at, of whom 20,000 a probably exaggerated figure have so far been enrolled.ARMENIA.According to Moscow the Armenian Revolutionary Committee has expressed its readiness to give concessions on a large scale to the Italian Government.O   15698
It was reported early in July that the final Bolshevist attack on the remnant of the Armenian National Government was impending.Later news is that the Bolsheviks have overrun the Zangezour, the last stronghold of the National Party, which has now disappeared.The Soviet Government in Erivau has appointed a new minister to Persia. Pending his arrival, Rothstein, who is also in charge of the interests of Soviet Azerbaijan, looks after Armenian affairs.AZERBAIJAN.The elections to the Azerbaijan Soviet are reported to have resulted in the return of a majority of 192 Moderate Bolsheviks against 170 Extremists.The, rising in Azerbaijan is stated to be spreading, and Sultanoff, who heads the movement, now controls the whole of that Karabagh district. Cholera is raging, and deaths at Baku number about 400 a day.AFGHANISTAN.Moscow&apos;s Diplomatic Train.A report received early in July states that on April 15th and 16th a special &quot; diplomatic&quot; train was loaded in Moscow for dispatch to Kabul, and placed in charge of Raskolnikoff. The load included litera-ture, a cinema apparatus with films for propaganda purposes, over 100 machines, many automobiles, and a present to the Amir. The personnel, both of the mission and of the train, was chosen from amongst the most reliable Communists.Afghan Aims and Ambitions.Information that has been received regarding the doings of the Afghan Delegation in Paris indicates that they have received news that their pourparlers with Moscow have resulted in a satisfactory agreement. Russia and Afghanistan are now-mutually pledged to help each other except against Turkey. Russia is ready to give Afghanistan the management of troublesome border tribes on condition that she allows them local autonomy with democratic rule, and guards the frontier against British intrigues. Russia appears to be nervous of Japan. The Delegation agrees with Moscow that it is necessary to cause dissensions among the Allied Powers ; it will work with Moscow to this end.According to Halil Halid Bey, formerly Turkish Consul in Bombay, who was in Paris at the same time as the Afghan Mission, the Afghans do not see eye to eye with Bekir Sami and his party. They are very extreme in their views ; they are out to upset India, and they have visions of a larger Afghanistan embracing Bokhara. Bekir Sami&apos;s attempts at a compromise with England are, in their view, a weak-kneed policy.The Afghan press, which is in its early youth, is mainly filled with anti-British propaganda. As regards Bolshevism, the only side of the shield presented is the anti-imperialistic side, which reflects the rage of the Soviet against England and France. There are some hopes that Prussianism may revive ; there is manifest a keen desire for the break up of the Allies. Meanwhile, LeninV agents at Kabul have great difficulty in squaring their professed concern for the independence of small nations with their aggressive policy. The invasion of Persia has left   the Afghans uneasy.    They are, indeed, discovering  that  the
Bolshevists are not pure altruists. Their flirtations with the Bolsheviks probably have for motive an attempt to secure better terms from England.TURKESTAN.The influence of the Turks in Turkestan- generally is considered to be very strong, and that of the Persian party to bo diminishing. The Turks, who are in close touch with the Anatolian Nationalists and with the Central Executive Committee of the Third International, through the Council for Agitation and Propaganda in Baku, have been trying to establish a &quot; Mohammedan Confederation of Turkestan, embracing Afghanistan and North India, with Bokhara as headquarters and religious centre. The Soviet Government, concealing its complicity, was to provide the necessary troops and material, and the Turkish Nationalists and the Third International to assist in propaganda. But on the establishment of the Confederation the local Turks were to declare their independence of the Third International and demand full liberty of action. They were not, however, averse from concluding a commercial treaty and a defensive alliance with the Soviet Government.8. FAR EASTERN STATES. SIBERIA.After the Coup d&apos;Etat.Moscow&apos;s protests against Japanese complicity in the Vladivostock coup d&apos;etat are said to have for motive a desire to influence public opinion in Russia and in particular the Red Army, which needs to have its fighting spirit roused if it is to be induced to serve in Siberia. The stories that the French and Japanese are arranging for the transfer of Wrangel&apos;s forces from Constantinople to Vladivostock are being circu-lated to this end. The Soviet is much worried over the situation in Siberia.It was reported during June that Semenoff was to go to Grodekovo, and that he would eventually proclaim himself Commander of the Far East Front. The Bolshevik General Parsky has brought two army corps to Siberia from Russia to quell the rebellion, guard the railway and assist Chita. The Bolsheviks are requisitioning more freely in Siberia and are transporting supplies westwards. This may indicate an ultimate intention of retiring on the Urals.A later report has it that Semenoff intended to go to Mongolia, although Ungern was now unwilling to co-operate with him. It seems therefore that Semeuoffs schemes are not likely to be successful.The Popular Assembly opened at Vladivostock on July 21st, the Social Revolutionaries and the peasants absenting themselves. The elections have not yet been completed in some districts.A Trading Scheme.A Chrisliania report states that the Polar explorer, Captain Otto Sverdrup, has accepted an offer to lead an English trade expedition to Siberia. The expedition, which was to start on August 1st, includes four British vessels and one Norwegian vessel bought by Arkos, and loaded chiefly with agricultural machines. The venture is said to be one that will develop, the company having bought 20 vessels for navigation to Siberia.0   1B698
9. BRITISH COLONIES. CANADA.Unemployment.The prevalence of unemployment, which is particularly noticeable in Vancouver and Hamilton, is arousing grave anxiety; only iu Eastern -Alberta is full time employment reported in consequence of improved coal orders.   Elsewhere apprehensions as to the winter are very grave.An &apos;.&apos; Economic Council&quot; has been formed in Vancouver to deal with unemployment, composed of representatives of service clubs, the Board of Trade, the Employers&apos; Association, the Trades and Labour Council, &amp;c. The Council of Workers, which represents about 25 organisations, has expressed its antagonism, and is taking steps to organise on a permanent basis. The Trades and Labour Council has withdrawn its delegates from the Council of Workers, ostensibly because members of that body howled down a speaker at a meeting in Vancouver.Extremist Movements.The Communists are vigorously exploiting the situation. They continue the organisation of their party in Vancouver, and are capturing a number of the leading agitators, in Ontario Communist organisation also proceeds. Here the unemployed agitation is the principal outward sign of unrest.At Hamilton the Communists are said to have obtained such control of the work less as to be talking of a Dominion-wide organisation of unemployed. The reorganisation of the party progresses steadily, and signs of an attack upon, tho prairies are multiplying. Jack Kavanagh has, however, stated, reporting on his visit to the prairies, that things were very dead ; in fact only two organisations were loft-Winnipeg &quot;and Calgary. And the Winnipeg branch was actually going airti-revolutionary as a result of the influence of Armstrong, who is inculcating the idea that the State may be captured by the capture of Parliament, an idea anathema to the local Reds.The break-up of the One Big Union progresses steadily, The organising tour of Russell and Johns was a complete failure. Receipts did not cover expenses, and the pair returned precipitately, without visiting Vancouver.   A quarrel within the ranks of the Union followed.Press reports state that Russell and Johns have asked for employment in the railway shops at Winnipeg, thus abandoning their posts as professional organisers. The Union is, in fact, in very grave difficulties on the prairies ; in British Columbia it has slightly rallied, so far as numbers go, having enrolled without fee all the unemployed who cared to give in their names. This indicates the extremist policy of organising and instigating riots noxt winter. The extremists are, in fact, sedulously teaching the working classes to expect in advance the possible evils of the winter. They wish to create a state of mind in which the masses will be frightened and angry-. An O.B.U. General Workers&apos; Unit is to be started in Vancouver.Negotiations between the Lumber Workers&apos; Industrial Union and the I.W.W. are reported to have made some progress,.but the Union seems to be collapsing and is threatened with the loss of its hall in Vancouver.The funds of the Socialist Party of Canada group in Vancouver have fallen very low, and it has been decided to take a cheaper theatre for meetings.
There have been enlistments of Vancouver radicals in the 18th BaUery C.F.A., for the purpose of spreading discontent and Rod propa-ganda.The influence of the Labour &quot; Churches &quot; seems to be declining ; that at Winnipeg is practically on its last legs financially.A new missionary known as Jackson has appeared in Communist&apos; circles in Toronto and Hamilton. Jackson, who may be Bob Jackson, brother of Fred Jackson, the organiser for the Hull district of the Com-munist Party of Great Britain, seems to be more of an organiser than a speaker, and to be charged with purifying and strengthening the Hamilton groups.   Bob Jackson is expected shortly to visit this country.Tho revolutionary bands in Montreal are joining forces to buy a house to serve as headquarters of the subversive forces in the city. Anna Buller is said to be at the bottom of the move. This woman has been addressing meetings at Toronto, aud is understood to cross the frontier frequently, acting as courier.The Canadian National Union oi Ex-Service Men.Delegates from the C.N.U.X. attended a meeting of tho United Soldiers&apos; Council at Vancouver and demanded that the Council take up unemployment. The meeting was, however, not responsive. The C.N.U.X. are also trying, with no great prospect of success, to persuade an organisation of Japanese returned men to join them. Meanwhile, the members of the Socialist Party of Canada are in bad odour with the C.N.U.X., who suspect their revolutionary fervour. An attempt made to organise a branch of the C.N.U.X. in Calgary secured only five or six members, principally undesirable members of other returned soldier organisations, which do not favour the C.N.U.X.The Ukrainian Communists.The Ukrainian Federated Communist Party appears to be extending its influence among the foreigners engaged in the hydro works in the Niagara district. These people have been discovered to possess a system of pilfering dynamite for revolutionary purposes. Those thefts are very difficult to check, owing to the great quantities of explosive issued for blasting and the comparative ease with which part of the charges issued may be secreted. Elsewhere the ferment among the Ukrainians continues. Some of the Ukrainian organisations appear to be rather Nationalist than Bolshevik in their tendencies, and more or less guarded criticisms of the Soviet regime in Russia have been heard. But discontent and subversive ideas permeate the Ukrainian farming population. The Ukrainian Labour Temple Association of Edmonton has appointed I. Naviziwsky as a special organiser. At Saskatoon the Ukrainian societies are quarrelling between themselves, and legal proceedings seem to be likely.Miscellaneous.Jack Tanner, who is living very quietly in Toronto, is apparently taking no active part in local revolutionary affairs.The violent anger aroused among the Vancouver Reds by street-corner religious preaching is a curious development, aud seems to suggest that such preaching is becoming an element of some importance in the life of the community.A paper called the il Workers&apos; Challenge,&quot; issued in New York, has been on sale. It is stated that Russian money pays for the paper, and that copies have been sent in by mail in sealed packets from New York.e 2
Au exceptionally effective anti-Bolshevist campaign has been con-ducted by a Lutheran Minister in Southern Saskatchewan among the German-Lutheran population.A non-political amalgamation of soldiers&apos; organisations was advocated at the Provincial Convention of the Canadian War Veterans&apos; Association for British Columbia, also compulsory military training for boys from 18 to.21 years of age.SOUTH AFRICA.The Progress of Communism.The Communist movement, though it touches only a small section of the population and does not figure in tho public eye, is reported to have reached a stage when its potential development requires tho serious attention of the Government. If it is not checked the pioneer work which is being done will give the revolutionists a dangerous hold on the coloured and native inhabitants of the Union. The Communists number those people among the proletariat of the country and sot themselves to work upon this material, which is promising from their point of view. In the Cape Town area the Communists have seized upon the Bullhoek incidents as a subject for fostering sedition and unrest.The Miners&apos; Ballot.The various mining unions decided to take a ballot on the question of acceptance or non-acceptance of the Chamber&apos;s proposal to bring into operation a wage reduction of eighteenpencc per shift on August 1st. The attitude of the Unions&apos; Executives is that the Chamber should consolidate half the cost of the living allowance, namely, 24s. per week, before wages are reduced. The coal miners oppose reduction, but it is admitted, even in. Trade Union circles, that the men stand little chauce of winning a strike or even of bettering their working conditions. The Unions are divided and disorganised.Miscellaneous.According to Press reports the mission of the Sinn Fein envoys has fallen rather flat, though it has had a measure of support from the Nationalists. English-speaking South Africans loathe the Sinn Fein crimes and appreciate the difficulties of the British Government.One Lenoblo, who has been elected a member of a special committee of Russian anarchists charged with propaganda in the British colonies, has recommended S. D. Foks at Cape Town as the chief man for propa-ganda in Cape Town, and A. I. Lerner as one of the secretaries. These persons are at present in Cape Town and are probably Rnssians.The Wages -Regulation Bill, which passed the Assembly but reached the Senate too late, is among the slaughtered innocents of the Parlia-meutary Session which has just closed. The Bill aimed at the settlement of wages by agreement on a district basis, with power to coerce defaulting employers the Government and farmers being exempted. The failure to pass it will make a bad impression in Labour circles.AUSTRALIA.In view of the Irish truce, the Commonwealth Government decided not to compel Archbishop Mannix to take the oath of allegiance before lauding.The decision of the Board of Industry increasing the living wage by 9d. a day to 13s. 3d. has caused consternation among the controllers of
industries, who foresee an enormous addition to their burdens. A number of industries are already closed owing to high wages and others have indicated that they will be unable to continue.At the first local government elections held in Queensland under the adult franchise, the Labour Party suffered a severe set-back. It put up nominees, in every centre, but its appeal was rejected, even in the recognised Labour centres. An almost total defeat. of the Labour Premiers party nominees is tho electors&apos; answer to the appeal for an expression of confidence in the party&apos;s platform and administration.NEW ZEALAND.The Industrial Position.The position of the Colony remains unsatisfactory, and the outlook for wool producers is still gloomy, though there has been a rise of prices. Authorities held by local bodies for the carrying out of public works have been cancelled, and only such works will be carried out as funds have already been provided for.Labour Aims.Following upon a conference held some time ago in Sydney the idea of an alliance of all unions into one big union is being fostered. The New Zealand Workers&apos; Union and the Miners&apos; Federation have been taking a ballot on the question of linking up with the One Big Union which is to be known as &quot; The Australasian Workers&apos; Union.&quot; The proposed constitution of this union is communistic, and provides for the destruction of capitalism, and the substituting of industrial Sovietism for the present national Parliament. The Communists make colour no bar to membership, while the One Big Union excludes Asiatics and Kanakas, but not Maoris or American negroes. It should be noted that the recent municipal elections throughout the country resulted in a con--siderable reduction of the number of labour representatives.An Alleged Seditious Publication.Two men named Hickey and Glover have been charged in Wellington with having respectively printed and sold a publication called &quot;The Irish Tragedy Scotland&apos;s Disgrace.&quot; These men are leaders of the Labour Party in Wellington, one editing and tho other publishing its official organ the &quot;Maoriland Worker.&quot; They were admonished, but the charge was dismissed on the ground that it had no bearing on the political sltua-tion in New Zealand.The Miners&apos; Unions of New Zealand expressed their disapproval of what they called an attempt by the Government to prohibit the circula-tion of &quot;working class&quot; literature by organising stop-work meetings at which motions of protest were passed to meet the occasion.WEST   INDIES. The Political and Labour Situation.The Leeward Islands are reported to be free from Bolshevik agitation. A very mild and quite constitutional agitation has been in progress among the better section of coloured and black people in Dominica and St. Kitts-Nevis for a change from Crown Colony to some more representative form of Government, and an association was formed in. St. Kitts-Nevis to further this aim.
In spite of the shipping aud agricultural depression in St. Lucia nothing in the way.of Bolshevik or political agitation has been introduced among the labourers.There was some excitement in labour circles at Georgetown. Demerara, during June, in consequence of a 20 per cent, reduction in the wages of stevedore porters and similar labourers. The reduction was, however, accepted, though the Union leaders complained that they had not been consulted, and talked of strikes. Given the number of unemployed in Georgetown no strike need be anticipated in the near future.The Negro Movement.An attempt is being made in St. Lucia by one Wiiberforce O. Nor-ville, founder of one of the two local branches of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League, which has been closed down, to start au opposition Negro Progressive Association with local interests as distinct from the American interests of the Improvement Association. Norville has been repudiated by the American headquarters of tho Association because of his too lively interest in the money sent to them.The American &quot; Universal Negro Improvement Society,&quot; under Marcus Garvey&apos;s direction, is trying hard to arouse racial animosity and to cou-solidate politically the black people of the West Indies on a racial basis. The organ of the Society, the &quot; Negro World,&quot; which is not without German aud Sinn Fein influences, and now aud again.bitterly attacks the British rule of native races, circulates freely throughout the West Indies. Representatives and agents of Garvey&apos;s Society are established in the West Indies, or are occasional visitors there, but in the Leeward Islands the effect of the &quot; Negro World &quot; propaganda has not so far been very marked.Garvey has been holding forth at Kingston, Jamaica, on the building up of au African Republic in Liberia. He exhorted his hearers to help the movement by supporting the Black Star Line and the Construction Loan for Liberia.10. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Correction.The name of Mrs. Harrison, mentioned in the Review for June in connection with the attempted visit of Senator France to Russia, was inaccurately printed as Mrs. Harris.The Labour Situation.The labour situation is heavy with peril, a peril greater than is appreciated by those in power, many of whom are being lulled into security by the present inability of labour to fight. As industry once again becomes normal and unemployment lessens, Labour will almost certainly attempt to recover what it has lost during the period of com-mercial depression. The fight of the employers against organised labour is markedly solidifying labour and the arguments of the radicals that the management of the American Federation of Labour is too conservative are being strengthened by circumstances. The formation of a political Labour Party is a possible development of the present bitterness between employers and employed.A very important labour development has been the creation of a Railway Labour Board, a Federal organisation, consisting of nine members appointed by the President, and theoretically representing owners, employees and public. Should the Board be successful in operation, it will have great influence on the stabilization of labour conditions, not in
the transportation industry only. Another important development is the establishment in the State of Kansas some time ago of a Labour Court with jurisdiction over labour disputes. This court should safeguard the interests of that oppressed and ignored third party, the public, since it will decide controversies that arise between employers and workers or between groups and crafts of workers engaged in the manufacture of articles of common necessity. It will also act in transport troubles. Under the law both strikes and lock-outs are prohibited, but an individual . retains the right to quit work at any time. Since its establishment this law has adjudicated 26 labour disputes without appeal being made, from its decisions. Several States are considering the adoption of like machinery.The Communists Amalgamating.ft is reported that the Proletarian Party of Michigan has been absorbed by the United Communist Party of America, and that the entire party will shortly be controlled by the United Communist Party of America. A promising attempt is also being made to bring in Stephen Biretrier and Louis Engdahl, of Chicago, both of whom are with the loft wing of the Socalist Party, which numbers, roughly, 200,600 members. If its schemes succeed the United Communist Party of America will influence about 2,500,000 workers, if it does not actually control them. It appears that William Haywood, William Biedeukapp and Dennis Batt went to Russia for the sole purpose of receiving instructions from the Third International. These instructions are for the purpose of adopting tactics that would make for the absorption of labour unions in much the same way as the Proletarian Party and various language federations of the Socialist Party are being absorbed by the United Communist Party of America. The United Communist Party of America wishes to have with it men who command large followiugs. Proceedings for tho reconciliation of tho two Communist parties have been taking place, although the Russian section of the Communist Party of America, does not wish to subordinate itself to the Pan-American Bureau, and tho two parties differ as to the control of the workers.Anti-British Movements.The anti-British or anti-Ally forces in the United States are reported to be very well organised aud to conduct a very clever propaganda, especially in schools and colleges.. Every subject which.can be made a cause of irritation is skilfully exploited.Some of the prominent Sinn Feiners in the United States are said to be leading members of the Communist Party who arc trying to make a real Communist Party out of the Sinn Fein movement. A correspondent says that Americans in the Western States are quite unconcerned about the Irish question. Little animosity seems to be felt there against the Germans.Miscellaneous.An International Convention of the Negro Races of the World is . being held in New York. The Convention sent a telegram to De Valera promising assistance.The Soviet Government has decided to release the 28 imprisoned Americans, the setting at liberty of whom was made a condition pre-cedent of help being given by the American Relief Commission to Russia..&apos; The Russian Government attorneys in New York allege that a certain Giacomo Roberto Cibrario has defrauded the Soviets of about 200,000Z.
entrusted to him for the purchase in America of 11,000,000 ft. of cinema film, and 2,500 cameras, for use in Russia. Not a foot of film or a camera has so far reached Russia.   Cibrario is under arrest.&quot;Olgin,&quot; the well-known Bolshevik journalist, has returned from Russia, where he has been negotiating with regard to the adherence to the Third International of Trade Unions and Socialist parties in the U.S.A.   Ho also represented the I.W.W.A firm known as Cohn &amp; Co. is reported as trying to secure platinum from Russia. It is suggested that this firm may be identical with Sigmund Cohn, 44, Gold Street, New York, refiner and worker in platinum. In connection with these operations it should be mentioned that the export of platinum from Russia has practically ceased.An Anarchist paper, &quot;Free Society,&quot; appears to emanate from the headquarters of the Anarchist Group of the United States and Canada in Cleveland, Ohio. The paper is printed surreptitiously, but in the earlier part of the year a number of people engaged in distributing it were arrested.   Most of these were Russians.The &quot; Forward Association &quot; of New York is a radical organisation controlling two Jewish newspapers, very radical and usually anti-British. One, &quot; Forward,&quot; is a daily published in English ; the other, the &apos;&apos;Neue Zeitung,&quot; a weekly published in Yiddish. The Association works closely with certain Trade Unions and influences about 200,000 persons in New York. It is very rich and is entirely controlled by a Russian Jew, Abe Kahn or italian, an able journalist and editor.11. SOUTH AMERICAN STATES.SOUTH AMERICA. CHILE.The closing down of the nitrate oficinas and the prevalent trade depression have produced a growing army of unemployed. There are at present in Santiago above 10,000 unemployed from the nitrate fields in the north, whom the Government is maintaining at a cost of 15,000 pesos a day. The Government proposes to reorganise its Labour Department.PERU.It is reported that the police service is to .be reorganised under the supervision of Spanish police officers, who will organise a training school for the police and prepare drafts of laws for the reorganisation of the police service.THE ARGENTINE.The Governments sudden and. surprising change of front in permit-ing free labour to work in the port of Buenos Aires is ascribed in some measure to the weight of public opinion, but the deciding pressure is said to have come from military circles. Most of the officers are politically opposed to the radical regime. A general is said to have personally told the President that if the port were not immediately opened for normal movement the military then on guard would take over control and declare the port open for the free labour of the Liga Patriotica, the Associacion del Trabajo and the Centro de Navegacion. After one outburst by the Federated Societies matters became quiet and &quot;work has proceeded normally.
The Government have shown that they are still behind the federa-tions by issuing working conditions which provide for an increase of pay from seven to eight dollars per day. If the proposals take effect the shipping companies are likely to boycott Buenos Aires. The firm, of A. M. Delfino and Cia, agents for the Hamburg South American Line and owners of the Argentina Cia. General do Navegaciou, who have been working uninterruptedly with federated labour, appear to be prepared to meet the suggested boycott of the port by the Centro de Navegacion, of which they are not members, by chartering steamers from the United States to capture the South American shipping trade. Gorman agents have been helping the Federated Societies with funds and Bolshevik literature.
PART II.1. THE RUSSIAN FAMINE.Tho only information about the extent of tho Russian famine comes from tlie Soviet Government and the accounts are conflicting. At present tho Soviet seems to have a fixed &apos;policy of exaggerating the extent of the famine in order to obtain manufactured goods ou credit and food for Moscow and Potrograd. Reading between the lines of the various Soviet utterances, one may judge that a serious drought has destroyed the crops in the regions of the Middle and Lower Volga, involving, it is said by the Soviet Government, a population of about eighteen millions and that some of these have left their homes and gone East and West ; that there is a famine in Moscow and Petrograd owing, not so much to the drought, as to the disinclination of the peasants to bring in supplies. The famine on the Voiga may be little greater than used to be suffered from time to time during the Ozarist regime (e.g., the famine in 1911-12), but since the transport has . broken down relief cannot be brought to the stricken provinces as it used to be. Generally, over tho other provinces of Russia the harvest appears to have been little below the average. The object of the Soviet Government is to keep itself in power, and it thinks that a supply of food and manufactured goods obtained ou credit may achieve this object. Its power at present appears to be limited to Moscow and Petrograd and such portion of the railway as is occupied by trustworthy Red Guard.On the other hand, Mr. Hodgson reports that thirty-five million people are involved. How far his estimate is founded upon Soviet figures is not known : it is far in excess of the figures hitherto issued by them.The &quot; Pravda,&quot; Avith an eye on Western Europe, is predicting a repetition of the great migrations which overwhelmed the Roman Empire. Other stories, such as that which pictures millions of starving peasants, marching on Moscow, where tho troops are waiting to receive them with poison gas, maybe discounted. Cholera is rife, plague, malaria of a virulent type, and even leprosy are also reported, and the danger to Western Europe may easily become grave.Kameneff has been candid enough to confess that the chief cause of the famine is not so much the drought as the hopeless economic policy of the Soviet. &quot;The attempt to introduce a general levy on the &quot; agricultural poduoe of the peasant has resulted in an enormous decrease &quot; of the areas sown a decrease of over 25,000,000 dessiatines. By our &quot; mistaken policy we have deprived the peasant of the last stimulus for &quot; cultivating his laud.&quot; And the &quot;Pravda,&quot; anticipating the collapse of the Soviet regime, remarks : &quot; We may have to go, but if we do go it &quot; will be only after we have uprooted the last remnants of the past. &quot; Those who will succeed us will have to build on ruins, a completely &quot; devastated country, in the dead silence of a cemetery.&quot;The Patriarch Tikhon and Maxim Gorky have issued appeals for help and service. Against these stands the stubborn fact that though it -is possible to send food and goods into Petrograd and Moscow as well as to Odessa, under no possible circumstances can this relief be carried to the Volga, and even if that were&apos; possible it would arrive too late. The probability is that any relief trains dispatched from Moscow eastward or southward would be looted en route, if not by the Red Guards then by the peasants. A russian who arrived at Riga a few days ago reports :  &quot; A ship with provisions was being discharged in Petrograd a week &quot; ago, the place of discharge was fenced in, the men while unloading &quot;- threw half of the cargo over the fence to their friends and womenfolk, &quot; the Red Army was called out and ammunition served out, the workmen
&apos; struck and threatened to sink the boat. The Red Army had to retire, &quot; and tho workmen continued unloading and supplying across the fence  &quot; only one-half of the shipload reached its. proper destination. Looting. &quot; everywhere is the standing rule, not only do the people loot individual &quot; trucks whole trains disappear, this is a common everyday occurrence. &quot; Everybody is starved loot is the only means to get food.&quot;Having first refused help from &quot;bourgeois&quot; Governments the Soviet leaders, alarmed about their own safety, have turned to the despised Cadets, Liberals, and &quot; White Guard&quot; elements for help and have appealed to tho Allied Governments for credit.An &quot;All Russian Famine Relief Committee &quot;has been constituted which will act under tho auspices of tho Red Cross, and will be absolutely non political. Kameneff has stated that the Soviet will respect tho non-political aspect of the Committee.Meanwhile, in reply to Maxim Gorky&apos;s appeal, Mr. Hoover, chairman of the American Relief Administration European .Children&apos;s Fund, stipulated that the immediate release of American held prisoners in Russia (now accomplished) and adequate provisions for administration are a sine qua non of assistance. Moscow is also required to plead for help directly to the representatives of the organisation, who are in addi-tion to be guaranteed their liberty, freedom of movement, and control of supplies. Mr. Hoover has instructed Mr. Walter Lyman Brown, Euro-peau director of the American Relief Administration, to go at once to Riga to prepare to extend relief work in Russia as soon as American prisoners are delivered. His offer to feed 1,000,000 Russian children has been accepted by the Bolsheviks.&apos;The German Government has promised help in the measure of its resources, aud. the French favour action by the Allies in co-operation with the United States. Tchitclierin intimates that 1,000,000 tons of foodstuffs are required to maintain the population ou half rations, while for seeds iu the districts where the harvest is completely lost, 850,0f 0 tons are required before September 15th.But it is already manifest that whatever may be the decision reached by the Supreme Council it will not be accepted by the Executive Committee of the Third International. Through the &quot; Humanite&quot; it has published a defiant manifesto, asserting that the capitalist states wish to profit by the famine, and to use charity as a cloak for renewing the invasion of Russia. They offer the Russian workers the choice of allowing world capital to organise counter-revolution or of refusing the conditions offered to them. The Committee calls upon the Communist parties in every country and the Red workers of the world to come to the aid of Russia. Aud beneath the truculence of tbe document sounds a cry of despair.Moscow,.indeed, seems to have taken alarm at the prospect of foreign supervision of foreign help. The Soviet delegations at Stockholm and Helsingfors have even announced that any proposal for foreign control of food for the starving will be rejected. And the Bolshevik press as a whole confirms their attitude. The&quot;Krasnaya Gazeta,&quot; for instance, writes : &quot; Foreign Powers are exploiting the agony of Russia as a means &quot; of anti-Soviet propaganda. Foreigners must therefore bo excluded &quot; from participation in the distribution of foodstuffs.&quot; . And the news-paper concludes &quot; time Danaos et dona fere?ites.&quot; The main contentions-tion of the Bolshevik press is that foreign states would be glad to see Russia starve, but are unable to resist the great pressure exercised upon them by the Commnnistically-minded within their borders. By. such obvious untruths do the Government and Party endeavour to stay the flood.
At a meeting in London the Russian delegates gave rough figures as to their requirements, which include 2,000,000 tons of wheat for food, 80,000 tons of seed, and great quantities of coal, cloth, boots, agricultural implements, chemicals, &amp;c. The list might include British goods but not grain, up to 10,000,000/. For 15 per cent, of this they could pay cash down, and securities . on the British Company Arcos could be offered to the stated value of some 70,000/. more, making a total of 220,000Z. Pressed as to what farther securities could be offered for payment, the delegates stated that they were not prepared to offer security beyond the endorsement of the Soviet Government. The position is that tho Delegation cannot underlake to acknowledge its debts, but at the same time is asking for further credit on the bare word of the Soviet Government.The probable effect of the famine will be to starve the Soviet Government out of existence, and that within a very few weeks. They may be succeeded by anarchy unless some provision can be made for the future. An International Relief Committee, composed of really efficient persons, including Russians, will, if the control of the railways is stipulated-lated for, acquire a preponderating influence until normal conditions are resumed, and if this Committee is very carefully chosen it may conceiv-ably become the nucleus of the next Russian Government. As to the financial question, the giving of credit need not necessarily mean a dis-bursement of public funds, for probably money would be forthcoming on a guarantee from the respective Allied Governments of repayment in case of default by any de facto Russian Government.2. LENIN: AN ADMISSION OF FAILURE.Copies of the private letter from Lenin, whose text appears below, have been obtained by the Soviet Delegation in Berlin, and have been sent by the left communist Lutovinow, who is Soviet representative there, to Zinoviev, the President of the Third Inter-national. The letter is addressed to a Dr. Jaffo, a pre-revolution friend of Lenin in Zurich.As concerns the Russian experiment, it rS&quot;*au admission of failure and miscalculation. He confesses that the old Adam in the workmen and peasants of Russia, in the Soviet bureaucracy and in the individuals of the Party itself, has been too strong for the reformers. In an important passage Lenin, avowing his belief in &quot; the strength of indi-&quot; vidual personality, whose freewill, exalted above class, grips that class &quot; and dictates to it,&quot; and a corresponding disbelief in &quot; class . . . an &quot; organism deprived of intellect, freewill, and self possession . . . &quot; approaches closely to Carlyle&apos;s doctrine of the hero in history.Moscow,10th June 1921.&quot; You ask me, dear friend, why the tone of my letters or rather my chats with you has ceased to be as optimistic as it,used to be. Indeed, I think that if we met, you would be astonished still more at the change which has taken place in me, and which is involuntarily reflected in my letters. Imagine a man who, in the course of three years, from day to day, from hour to hour, goes on doing one and the same sort of work without having a single moment to himself, or possibility of breaking away from the great burden of toil which swallows up all his time, energy, and strength.&quot; More and more T recall the happy days in Zurich, when we used to converse- for hours on the approaching- upheaval and on the coming
realisation of our theories, and of the inevitable phases which would mark the sociological changes in the class relationships and social forms of contemporary Europe. You exasperated me more than once by the cold criticism of your practical mind a criticism which seemed to me quite divorced from the realities to which I, and those who thought with me, had devoted all their abilities, and which, it seemed to me, wo had succeeded in learning how to study.&quot;You practical/neii only think of what grips you in tho present, and on that you spend your labour. Yon see in life the one path which, according to you, a realist who wants to create in life ought to tread. You understand every task only from a narrow egotistical point of view, in so far as brings you directly this or that advantage, this or that profit-Without ever dipping deep down into the reality of your surroundings, without interesting yourself in that which is not directly of use to you, with your egotistical morality you think it right to live for yourself, to conquer for yourself, and to throw to the weaker only the crumbs you do not need, without thinking whether they are sufficient or not. If you remember to judge by your letters you have not forgotten our talks in Zurich Library, and later in Geneva, when, foaming at the mouth, you proved to me how Utopiau were my thoughts, how incompatible they were with the contemporary outlook of European society, in which the highest form of Capitalism and egotistic philosophy had finally crystallised, then I will tell you of one little fact which then escaped my observation, but which deeply interests me now as affording an indirect proof of the accu-racy of my deductions in my arguments with you and so emphasizes, once again, the superiority of our theories over your practical observation.&quot; Three years&apos; unceasing study of the phases of the revolution in Russia have taught me to seek and find in everything, not the genius of class constructiveness, not collective instinct, driving the members of a class to work in the right direction, but above all other forces the strength of individual personality, whose freewill is exalted above class, grips this class and dictates to it what are the most useful and essential methods to adopt at the present moment of the class struggle. We have all made a mistake in attributing such vast importance to the class, looking upon it as if it were an intellectual organism, capable of giving a direct aud spontaneous manifestation of its will. Class is no more than an organism absolutely deprived of intellect, freewill, and self-possession, aud animated only by the class instinct of self-preservation, which never dictates any more useful line of action than what the immediate present demands. The act of a class, as such, is always deprived of reason, for it never takes thought of what the further course of the struggle is likely to be. The life of a class it is like a vast mollusc, which resists and straggles with the same energy, whether it be against an enemy upon which its exi ;tence depends or against the most paltry foe. The strength of the free intellect alone can further the course of the struggle and sum up the whole situation pro aud con.&quot; Both I and my colleagues and you practical men alike have over-looked this greatest factor in social life, and if we paid any attention to it it was only in so far to refer to it as a form of our conclusions, on the nature of class&quot; Those endless perspectives for observation, which the Russian revolution opens, have made it possible for me more than once to convince myself of the falsity of our premises, aud approaching the question from your point of view, I cannot but admit that you were more right than I.&quot; To speak now of myself, I am tired. I feel this more and more every day, and involuntarily long to relax over my books and verify by
objective observation the conclusions to which I have given my whole life. My nerves are not what, they were. More anil more I begin to fret, at the triviality of those around me, their suburban attitude of mind, which destroys the organism of the party. To run the State as it is being run now with us is downright impossible. Our young bureaucracy have embraced all the shortcomings of their forerunners and in their naivete have deepened still further the rift which existed bqfore between the rulers and the ruled.&quot; We have lost, our stake on the collective instinct which was to have supported tlie members of the party. Our hopes in the same collective instinct and class consciousness on the part of the workers and peasants have also been a fiasco.&quot; I remember now your parting words when I left for Russia in 1917. You told me that I ought never to forget that, after years of exile had torn me away from the possibility of observation of Russian society on tho spot, I had completely lost touch with the psychology of the Russian workmen and peasants, and that I ought to be careful. Power, success, lashed us all on. I myself was carried away by tho possibility of verification-fying my theories in practice, deeply believing in the staunchness and vitality of my party. Throwing to the crowd the broad perspectives of the coining social reforms, I tried to awaken in the intelligent proletariat of the workers and peasants the self-action which would cause the orders of the Centre to be carried out, thus forming the foundations of a Socialist State in the future, to serve as a model to the peoples of the world. I tell you 1 have hesitated for three years in coming to realise that we were wrong, that I had adopted wrong measures, but now, in weighing up the sum of our activity, I must admit that I was wrong, that I over-estimated tho forces and strength of the party, and I over-estimated the Russian workmen and peasants.&quot;I tell you, in short, that both the Russian workman and the Russian peasant have betrayed their interests, have absolutely, unconsciously, betrayed the party by the combined flabbiness and weight of their mentality, which overcame the revolutionary spirit and sapped the development of the revolutionary psychology half-way. The&apos;naivete, the childish culture, the childish cruelty, the complete lack of under-standing, the inability to understand the necessity of working, slowness in reacting to new ideas that is the log which we have shown ourselves unable to move, notwithstanding all those really heroic efforts which tho party has made during these years. If we hold together, we do so only by the efforts of the party-and that has perforce to waste all its lifting force to retain power and so-if only a little to prolong the possibility of building up a new social outlook and so prepare the way for the further development and extension of the social revolution. I feel that the strength of the party is daily becoming more and more exhausted, and (hat the seeds of internal dissension and petty ambition of individuals, who place private interests above common interests, are beginning to eat into it. The conflict stares us in the face at every turn. Long ago I saw the necessity of compromise, the necessity of concessions from our side, which&apos; would pour new strength into the party, to strengthen-if only a little the worn-out band of really devoted party workers. Without this, not only our retention of power, but even our continued existence was impossible. Revolutionary militarism, the be-all and end-all of our &apos; Napoleons,&apos; will, in my opinion, break down, and will, be the last effort of our party, which will perish in exhausting the whole of its human reserve.&quot;I have written to Krassin about the need to enter into private pourparlers with the Socialist groups abroad as to the possibility of
some sort of compromise. I torn to you with the same request as an old friend, and besides, an absolutely non-party man. It will be easier for you to get into contact with tho exiles, easier for you to come to some sort of understanding with their leaders.&quot; I do not conceal that I would like to have some news of you as soon as possible. Time will not wait, and it is better to come to an understanding now than in six months when it may bo too late.&quot;I shall look for letters from you in the near future. I find it a rest reading them, remembering you and our Zurich talks.&quot;I greet you with all my heart.-   &quot; Yours,&quot;V. Ulyaxov.&quot;3. BOLSHEVIK ACTIVITIES IN NORTHERN MANCHURIA.The following report is from a Japanese official source, and should he so regarded : The destruction of the anti-Bolshevik army in the Far East has enabled the Soviet Government and Bolshevik&apos; elements in Eastern Siberia to join hands. Bolshevik propaganda in Northern Manchuria has become active since the establishment of the Far Eastern Republic. With Harbin as centre of operations it aims at the Bolshevisation of Chosen as a jumping-off ground for Bolshevik penetration in China.The principal agency of Bolshevik propaganda in Harbin is the Harbin Trade Union and Trade Guild. The Harbin Union permeates all trade bodies in Harbin. It has organisations among employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway Company, including the Railway Workers&apos; Central Trade Union, the Mechanics&apos; Central Trade Union, the Minor Workers&apos; Central Trade Union, the Accountants&apos; Central Trade Union and the&apos; Technical Superintendents&apos; Central Union. The Harbin Railway Federation Conference works under instructions from Chita and is presided over by Gortchakovsky, also the general chairman of the Union. The Executive Committee of the Railway Federation is composed of one or mere delegates from each Union and carries out the usual subversive policy of Bolshevism abroad by propaganda and other means.Though Gortchakovslc3r is the head of the Harbin Trade Union, actual power is in the hands of the Jews who are powerful among the Russian community in Harbin. From time to time Commissioners of tho Chita Government come to Harbin with despatches, propaganda pamphlets, and funds, while the Union maintains the brothers Khfaib-sheivitch at Chita as its representatives with the Far Eastern Republic. The intimacy of its relations with the Chita Government is visibly increasing.The Harbin Union publishes as its organs the newspapers, &quot; Vporiod&quot; and &quot; Novostijizni.&quot; It also conducts a Labour College in Harbin where courses in History, Sociology, Political Science, Literature, and Hygiene, are held. The college has a daily attendance of between 600 and 700 40 per cent, of whom are working men and the remainder members of the Intelligentsia, including a few women. Of the propaganda scheme maintained by the Union, the Labour College appears to be the most effective branch.The Harbin Union is actively collecting arms and ammunition. When the Czecho-Slovaks left Manchuria it bought what they left. There is a recent report to the effect that the Union has imported 500 revolvers and Maxim guns--with 4,000 rounds of - ammunition from Spain. Altogether it is believed that the Union must have between 2,000 and
3,000 rifles and a number of machine guns. Its activity is extending over the Chinese Eastern Railway zone and is particularly noticeable in places where the workshops of that railway are situated, particularly in Harbin, Hailar, Manchuria, Hentaohotzu, Pograuitchuaya and Kuancherg-compulsory. Its propaganda, however, appeals especially to Russians ; Chinese and Koreans pretending conversion do so mainly for gain. Questions of state ami social reconstruction are of small interest to the Chinese coolies and peasants in Northern Manchuria, and but for the bait of gain the propaganda lof the Union would probably have no hold ou them. Bolshevists, however, seem inclined to be content in the meantime to make converts in appearance, hoping, no doubt, that the reality will come later on.The Social Revolutionaries have also a branch at Harbin, affiliated to . their headquarters in Moscow.    This   body has no relation with other political bodies at Harbin.    It works under the presidency of Michael and is described as a sound and flourishing exponent of the principles for which they stand.Printed by Eyre and Sfottiswoode, Ltd., East Harding Street, E.C. i.
