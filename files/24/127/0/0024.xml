[This Docioanent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1921.SECRET.CP.-3223.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 8th instant.General State of the Country.Police reports of crime and outrage show that in general the truce arrangements are being observed faithfully throughout the country. Such violations as have occurred in the South are few in number and slight in nature, and have proved well within the capacity of liaison officers to settle without serious disturbance of the atmosphere of peace. The most serious event of the kind occurred in Belfast, in which city, owing to the existence of three contending parties, as compared wi h only two in the southern parts of the country, it is not so easy to maintain an equipoise of peaceful will and endeavour. Here two Sinn Fein civilians, members of the I.R.A., were sent out by their local commandant on the 8th August upon duties which they termed and regarded as &quot; Police &quot; duties. They went armed their excuse being that their duties would take them into areas which they called &quot; hostile area,&quot; where they were liable to attack not from the Police, but from rival civilian factions. A Police Constable in plain clothes, regarding their conduct as suspicious, sought to arrest them, whereupon they produced their revolvers and fired at the Constable. One shot wounded the Constable slightly in the leg. The other, missing the Constable, struck the firer&apos;s own comrade in the stomach, from which wound he is likely to die. The affair has thrown some strain on the relations between the two rival factions. The offenders have been arrested, and it is not expected that any consequent disturbance will arise.The good effect upon public opinion of the decision to release all members of Dail Eireann in Crown custody (in order that they might be free to attend the meeting of Dail Eireann summoned for the 16th August) was almost completely eclipsed by an amazing public outcry against that part of the decision which precluded the release of one member, John McKeon, who had been convicted of murder.. McKeon, by reason of a striking personality, by certain acts of considera-tion towards members of Crown Forces who, after fighting, had fallen into his power, and by a dramatic speech from the dock when he was sentenced all of which matters have been fully advertised by Sinn Fein propaganda had attained a remarkable place in Sinn Fein esteem. The earlier decision, not to release him, was taken as a sign that he would suffer the death penalty, and was a signal for a wave of intense feeling which went some distance towards imperilling the truce. . His subsequent release not only terminated a most difficult situation, but has proved the text for more amicable references to Britain and to its conduct of Irish affairs than have been made for some time past.&apos;Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial., Forty-four court-martial trials were concluded during the week, resulting in 41 convictions - and 3 acquittals. The following is an analysis of the sentences imposed : 1 sentence of penal servitude for life. 23 sentences of penal servitude (3 years to 15 years). 15 sentences of imprisonment with hard labour (6 months to 2 years).2 sentences remitted by Confirming Officer.Total 41 [6771]
