An Arab Govern-ment is in process of being established, and it is perfectly clear that the direct ownership and exploitation of oil fields in Mesopotamia by His majesty is Government would not be practicable or consistent with the political arrangements which have been made.    Surther in the correspondence with the United States Government which has been published His Majesty&apos;s Government argued energetically and effectively in support of the validity of the right of the Turkish Petroleum Company to a lease of the oil fields.     .While talcing up this attitude Lord
Curzon expressly laid down -that&quot;&quot;&quot;neither the rights of tho &quot;Turkish Petroleum Company nor the provisions of the San-&quot;Rome ,0 1 Agreement will preclude the Arab state from e*ijOJf* &quot;ing the full &quot;benefit of ov/nershlj) or from proscribing $h;$   , &quot;conditions on which the oil fields shall bo devolcpip^1 f It is considered desirable that the development of tho oil fields, which has &quot;been so long delayed, should not be held up indefinitely in the future, and it ie proposed to enter into preliminary discussions with the Turkish Petroleum Company as to the terms and conditions on which they should receive, first a prospecting license and ultimately a lease from the Arab Government.I wish the Cabinet to record their approval in principle of this course of procedure and their opinion that the decision recorded on January 23rd 1920 should not stand in the way of its immediate adoption.(Initialled)     W. S. C.Colonial Office, SSW.August 29&apos;6h, 1921.
