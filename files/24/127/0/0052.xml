fHIg DOGUlVirJNT IS THE PROPERTY OF PUS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.ECONOMY IN NATIONAL EXPENDITURE - NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE,FfP:memorandum by the Minister of Health.CP. 3251. M.H, 39.I circulate for the information of ray colleagues a copy of &amp; Memorandum which I have submitted to the Treasury.ALFRED MOND.Unistry of Health. 20th August,  1921,
TREASURY CIRCULAR ON ECONOMY.i*u In a previous memorandum by the Ivlinlster of Health thequestion of reductions on the Estimates of the Ministry of Health in 1922-23 was dealt with and it was indicated that it should be possible, on lines stated in the memorandum, to effect a reduction varying between approximately 8 per cent and 12 per cent on. this year*s figures.(2)   The Minister pointed out that in his judgment an increase of contributions of employers and employees under the National Health Insurance Acts was at the present time open to very serious objection, and he still remains of that opinion.    It appears, however, advisable to indicate what economies could be secured, over and above those mentioned in the previous memorandum,  If the Government should decide that the general financial position renders necessary an increase of contributions of(a) 4d per week.(b) Id per week. (3)   These particulars are embodied in the note andfinancial statement appended.
TREASURY CIRCULAR OH ECONOMY. National Health Insurance.The cost of National Health Insurance services is at present about     10,400,000 per annum for the whole of Great Britain made up as follows:-(a) State proportion (2/9ths) of the cost  of benefits and administration ..... 6,400,000(b) Special Grant for Medical Services(4/3 per insured person).........* * 3,180,000(c) Special Grant for Insurance Committees&apos;administration expenses ............ 320,000(d) Women1 s Equalisation Fund **.***.*.... 350,000(e) Central Fund *e....................... 150,000Total .........       10,400,000Under the National Insurance Act which has recently been passed a net saving to the Exchequer of about  300,000 per annum for Great Britain is to be made by the suspension of the Exchequer Grant to the Central Fund (Item e) and the reduction by 4d. per Insured person per annum of the special grant for Insurance committees expenses (item o), less the State proportion of the additional administration money, made available by the Bill, which now becomes payable*The further saving which oan be effected by a reduction In the capitation payment to doctors (item b) has been   referred to in the previous Memorandum and it has been shown that for every 6d. by which the capitation rate can be reduced a saving of approximately  320,000 for England and Wales oan be secured.The/* These are international funds for the whole United Kingdom and part of the amount Is, therefore, in each case assignable to Ireland,
The only other way in which a saving to the Exchequer could be effected would be:-(a) by the transfer from the Exchequer to insurance funds of part .of the amount which would have to be provided by special Exchequer grant for medical services after the maximum reduction possible had been secured In the capitation rate;(b) by the reduction of the State proportion of the costof benefits and administration from 2/9ths to some smaller fraction.s .d.The present cost of medical services is 13/9 per insured person pen annum made up as follows:-s.d.Capitation payment to doctors....................11. 0.Mileage Grant for doctors In rural areas ........       6.Drugs and dispensing.......................... i,.   2.3.13. 9.Under Section 7(1) of the National Health Insurance s .d . s .d .Act. 1920, 9/6 of this amount of 13/9 is provided out of insurance funds which are derived as to 7/9ths from thecontributions of the insured persons and their employers andas to the remaining 2/9ths from the Exchequer.     The balance of4/3 is defrayed by a direct Exchequer Grant.The reduction of the doctors&apos; capitation rate from s. g.d. a.      s.d .      s. -11/.&quot; to 9/6, 9/-, 8/s or 8/- would reduce the amount to befound by a direct Exchequer Grant towards the cost of medicals.d.     s.d. s.d. s.d.     s.d. services from the present figure of 4/3 to 2/9, 2/3, l/9 or l/3 per insured person per annum.The transfer of any part of the balance from theExchequer to insurance funds would require legislation andwould involve an increase in the weekly contributions.     Theeffect of transferring the whole of the balance to insurance funds would probably result in the Societies insisting on beingparties to any settlement with the doctors as to their remunera-tion.     Direct negotiations between the Societies and the medical profession
profession on this subject would be not unlikely to end in a deadlock arid a resultant hreakbown of medical benefit.     If It is tlx ought advisable to avoid this contingency and to retain in the hands of the Government the power of central bargaining with, and discipline over, the doctors it would be necessary for the Exchequer to continue to make a small contribution as a direct grant towards the cost of medical services and It is suggested that at least 3d. per insured person per annum should be retained as a special grant for medical benefit,.An increase of Id. a week in contributions would enable the whole coat of medical benefit in excess of 3d, to beborne by Insurance Funds even if it ware found impossible tos*d.obtain a larger reduction than 1/6   in the capitation rate to doctors and a .saving to the Exchequer of  3.-303,000 would be secured in England and Wales in addition to the saving of  1,177,000 referred to in the previous Memorandum, making a total sa.v3.ng of over  2,480,000 i*o. over 26% of the estimate for 1921-22.     If the capitation rate of payment to doctors were reduced/ to 8/- the increase in contributions would also enable the State proportion of the cost of benefits and administration to be reduoed from 2/9tha to 2/iOths and the total saving would be Increased to  3,265,000.     If a reduction of the capitation rate9* Sad.to 9/- or 8/6   only were secured the reduction in the Stateproportion of the coat of benefits and administration could be varied to a fraction between 2/9tha and&apos; 2/10 ths and the totalsaving would vary correspondingly between two and a half andthree and a quarter millions.     If the contributions were increasedby :l-dv a week, It might be found necessary to place the increase on employers, in view of the practical difficulties of making -Id-deductions from weekly wages.If the maximum reduction which could be secured in thes.d,capitation rate to doctors were 1/6   an additional contribution of/
of Id. pe&quot;r week would, make it possible to put the whole oost of medical bsueflk on tfci Xtx^rano^ funds in erx^ss of the 3d. direct grant ^eter-rad to above, and also to reduce the State proportion of the cost of benefit and administration from 2/9ths to 2/l0ths.An increase of Id. in the contribution would be more than sufficient to meet the cost of, the adjustments suggested, and, in order to secure the acceptance of the increase by insured persons, the balance, which would amount to about. 1/-^ a member per annum, would probably have to be used in providing new benefits for insured persons.s^d.If the capitation rate were reduced below.9/S   a further saving might be secured by reducing the State proper-tion of the cost of benefits and administration below 2/10 ths. The saving, together with the saving referred to in the previous Memorandum, would vary from  3,000,000 to  3,600,000.If the weakly contribution were increased by Id., the obvious course would seem to be to divide the addition equally between the employers and the workers.     If, however, the difficulties of making -^d. deductions from wages make this course impracticable It would be necessary to place the whole addition on the workers.A summary of the total possible savings which could be effected if these changes were adopted is shown In the accompanying statement.
