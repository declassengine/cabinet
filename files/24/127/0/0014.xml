(THIS jdocde&amp;kt 13 THB people.PSB.TY OF HIS BRI2AHJIC MAJISTY&apos;3 GOTi^E^?).cp. 3214.C A3 np,1   rp% -    ft ,reply rno:: mr. r;s valera to &quot;proposals01?&apos; THE BHITI8H GOVSKrIIiiSIT Km AS IRISH SJjTTIJTjI^T&quot;. (See cp, 314-9).*Official Translation ).Office of the President, Lublin, Mansion HouseAugust 10, 1921.The Rt. Eon, David Lloyd George, 10, Downing Street,Whitehall, London.Sir,On the occasion of our last interview I gave it as my judgment that Lail Eireann could not and that the Irish people, would not accept the proposals of your Government as set forth   in the draft of July 20th which you had presented to me.   Having consulted my colleagues, and with them given those proposals the most earnest consideration, I now confirm that judgment.The outline given in the draft is self-contradictory, and &quot;the principle of the pact&quot; not easy to determine,   To the extent that it implies a recognition of ireland separate nationhood and her right to self-determination, we appreci-ate and accept it.   But in the stipulations and express conditions concerning the matters that are vital the principle is strangely set aside and a claim advanced &quot;by your Government to an interference in our affairs, and to a control which we cannot admit.   -Ireland&apos;s /
Irelands right tr0^oose--X-or  erseLf the path see shall take to realise her om destiny must he accepted as indefeasible.      It ia a right that has hoeiraairrtalQed through centuries of oppression, and at the cast of unpar-alled^ ed s ac rifl^ - an d...uat6Xd. suffering ,   and it will not he surrendered.     /,&apos;e cannot propose to abrogate or impair it, nor can Britain or any other foreign state or group -of states legitimately claim to interfere with its exercise in order to serve their own special interests.The Irish people1s belief is that the national destiny can best be realised in political detachment, free from imperialistic entanglements which they feel will involve enterprises out of harmony with the national character, prove destructive of their ideals, and be fruitful only of ruinous wars, crushing burdens, social discontent, and general unrest and unhappiness. the small ^tatss of Europe they areyprepared to hazard their independence on the basis of moral right, confident that as they would threaten no nation or people they would in turn be free from aggression themselves. This is the policy they have declared for in plebiscite after plebiscite, and the degree to which any other line of policy deviates from it must be taken as a measure of the extent to which external pressure is operative and violence is being  -done to the wishes of the majority.As for myself and my colleagues, it is our deep convictia1 that true friendship with England&apos;, which military coercion has frustrated for centuries, can be obtained, most readily . now through amicable but absolute separation&apos;.     The fear, groundless though we believe it to be, that Irish territory may be used as the basis for an attack upon :;nglandTs liber-ties can be met by reason&amp;ble^guarand^s-jaci^lr^ with Irish, sovereignty&apos;.
* Dominion.-. vrlio TUKier^t&amp;n&amp;s &quot;the-conditions knows to &quot;be illusory.   The freedom,.-which the British Dominions! enjoy is not so much the result of legal enactments .&apos; or of treaties as of the immense distances which separate them from Britain and hare-made interference by her impracticable. The most explicit guarantees, including the rominions&apos; acknow-le&amp;ged right to secede, would be necessary to secure for Ireland an equal degree&apos;of freedom.   There is no suggestion however in the proposals made of any such guarantees.   Instead, the natural, position i3 reversed; our geographical situation with respect to Britain is made the basis of denials and re-sirric---tions unheard of in the case of the Dominions; the smaller island must give military safeguards and guarantees to the larger and suffer itself to be reduced to the position of a helpless dependency..It should-be obvious that we could not urge the acceptance of such proposals upon our people.   A certain treaty of free association with the British Commonwealth group, as with a partial league of nations, we would have been ready to recom-mend, and as a Government to negotiate and take responsibility for, had/we an assurance that the entry of the nation as a whole into such association would secure for it the allegiance of the present dissenting minority, to meet whose sentiment alone this step could be contemplated.Treaties.dealing with the proposals for free inter-trade and mutual limitation of armaments we are ready at any- time to negotiate.  ,Mutual agreement for facilitating air communica-tions, as well a8* railway and other communications, can we feel certain also be effected.   Ho obstacle of any kind, will be
placed by us in Uhje*--wtrf of that- smooth ^wrwwtai iirtwootdrae which is essential in the life of both islands, each the best customer and the best mar*ae-t of the other,    It must of course be. uno^retood &apos;.hat all treaties and agreements would have to be submitted for ratification to the national legislature in the first instance, and aubse^ently to the Irish people as a whole., under eirxyamsi^aj&amp;ces which would make it evident that their decision would be a free decision, and that every element, of military compulsion was absent.The question of Irelandfs liability &quot;fsr a ahara of the present debt of the United Kingdom&quot; we are prepared to leave to be-^etermined by a board of arbitrators, one appointed by Ireland, one by Great Britain, and a third to be chosen by agreement, win default, to 03 i^^iattfd, say, by the President of the United States a,f Aiiws?iaa,&apos; if the President would consentsAs regards the qa^vion at issue between the political minority and th$ great majority of the Irish people, that must remain a question for the Irish people themselves to settle. We cannot admit the right of the British Government to mutilate our oountry, either in its ,vwn interest or at the call of any section of our population.    We do not contemplate the use of force.     If your Government stands aside, we can effect a com-plete reconciliation.     Wo agree with yon &quot;that no common action can be secured by force&quot;.     Our regret is that this wise and true principle which your Government prescribes to us for the settlement of our local problem it seems unwilling to apply consistently to the fundamental problem of the relations between our island end yours.    The principle we rely on In the one case we are ready to apply in the other, but should this principle not yield m   immediate settlement we are willing that this question too be submitted to external arbitration.
Thus we*are ready to meet you in all that is reasonable and just.     The responsibility for irAtdailng ^and effecting an. honourable peace rests primarily not with our Government but with yours.     We have no -conditions to impose, no claims to advance but the one, that re be freed from aggression. uq reciprocate with a sincerity to be measured only by the terrible sufferings our people have undergone the desire you express for mutual and lasting friendship.     The sole cause of the &quot;ancient feuds&quot; w&apos; ten you deplore has been, as we know, and as history proves, the attacks of English rulers upon Irish liberties.     These attacks can cease forthwith, if your Government has the will.    The road to peace and understanding lies open.I em, Sir,Faithfully yours,(Signed) EAMON   DE VALERA,
