A(.this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s government.)Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1921. ^-jSECRET.CP. h 3. L). fThe Treaty of Sevres.memorandum by the secretary of state for india.Yesterday in the House of Commons, the Prime Minister stated that he had &quot; no doubt the Treaty of Sevres will have to be reconsidered.&quot; I cannot emphasise too greatly the delight with which these words will be read in India. This ill-starred treaty has brought no peace, and the Government of India have so often protested against its provisions. But this is only a parliamentary repetition of die statement which the Prime Minister is reported to have made at the Supreme Council, that the Treaty of Sevres had been &quot; torn up.&quot;But the Prime Minister went on to say : &quot; You cannot expect a country &quot; which has waged a successful war to be satisfied with the same terms as a &quot; country which is prepared to forego its full claim in order to avert the terrors &quot; and risks of war.&quot; Against this announcement I must take the earliest possible opportunity of protesting. 1 do not know what is meant by the words &quot; full claim.&quot; What i do know is that by allotting Thrace and Smyrna to Greece we certainly put under Grecian rule a large number of Turks who have been ill-treated by their new rulers in a way which I want to put it as uncontroversially as possible is at least comparable to any treatment which may have been meted out by the Turks to the Greeks. But if the Prime Minister meant by this sentence that in his opinion new territory will have to be allotted to the Greeks from that which was left to Turkey by the Treaty of Sevres, the policy foreshadowed seems to me to be quite impossible, for it must mean giving the Greeks territory for which they had no claim whatever. The Cabinet has never considered this matter since it accepted the conclusions of the Constantinople Committee which met at Chequers. The conclusions of that Committee were to accept the terms suggested to the Turks and the Greeks in London, as modified by the letter which, with the authority of the Prime Minister, I wrote to the Indian Mohammedan Delegation.i am sorry to lind myself so much more in agreement with Colonel Guinness than with tho Prime Minister on this subject. After all, we are constantly being told that the Turks brought their fate upon themselves by their refusal, to accept the London terms. But surely it is strictly accurate to say also that the Greek Government did not accept them either. They failed to answer exactly as the Turks failed, and whilst we were waiting.for answers from both Countries the Greeks attacked the Turks. I say the Turks, but it must never be forgotten that the Sultan&apos;s Government at Constantinople sighed the Treaty of Sevres and have not been at war with us or with our Allies or with the Greeks during the whole of this unhappy period. I imagine that there is nothing to be done at the moment, and that we can only await events; but I am sure that the phrase which I have quoted from the Prime Ministers speech will be much canvassed, not only in Greece and in Turkey, but in India.May I in addition respectfully remind the Prime Minister that in 1897 the Powers prevented Turkey, after the completest victory over Greece, from obtaining any cessional territory at all.E. S. M.17th August 1921.4523      100   8.21
