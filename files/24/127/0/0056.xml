LEAGUE   01   NATIONS.evidential.Sv.-gOo , Geneva, June 28th, 19210Report of the Oommittee appointed to Study the scope of Article 18 from a legal point of view, to the Committee on Amendments to the Covenant, regarding the legal obligations imposed by Article 10 of the CovenantaThe Committee of Jurists, whioh was instituted by the CouncilTs Resolution of February 21, 1921, for the purpose of studying the. scope of Article 18 of the Covenant from a legal point of view, has been requested by the Committee on Amendments to the Covenant to be good enough to consider the.question, &quot;What obligations does Article 10 impose on Members of the League, in addition to and apart from the obligations contained in the other Articles of the Covenant?&quot; and to give a legal opinion concerning it.In compliance with this request., the Committee has studied the question submitted to it and has examined the report of the Oommittee on Amendments to the Covenant rj as well as the proposal of the Canadian Delegation at the Assembly0     It named M0 Struycken as its Happorteur0 Mr* Green, Member of the Legal Section of the Permanent Secretariat of the League, of Nations, acted as Secretary of the Committee during the consideration of Article 1QUThe Committee has arrived at the following conclusions :Article 10 was inserted in the Covenant on the proposal of President Wilson.     The original proposal read as follows
&quot;ARTIOLjS Hit&quot;The Contracting Powers unite in guaranteeing to each other political independence and territorial integritys out it is understood between them that suoh territorial readjustments, if any^ as may in the future become necessary by reason of changes in present racial conditions and aspirations, or present social and political relationships, pursuant to the principle of self-determination, and al30 such territorial readjustments as may in the judgment of three-quarters Of the delegates he demanded by the welfare and manifest interest of the peoples concerned, may he effected if agreeable to those peoples; and that territorial changes may in equity involve materialcompensation.   The Contrasting Powers aooept without reservation the principle that the peace of the wor?d is superior in lmportanoo to every question of political jurisdiction tr boundary11.In a subsequent draft the proposal was worded asfollows t-&quot;ARTICLE X (ii)*They undertake to roapeot the territorial integrity of all States Members of the League, and to protect them from foreign aggression, and they agree to prevent any attempts by other States forOibly to alter the territorial settlement existing at the date of, or established by, the present treaties of peace&quot;.&quot;ARTICLE .8.If at any time it should  appear that the&quot;boundaries of any State guaranteed by Article I (iK (ii) do not conform to the requirements of the Bituationf the League shall take the matter under consideration and. may recommend to the parties affected any modifi-cation whioh it may think necessary^   If such recommendation is rejected by the parties af footed, the States Members of the League shall, so far as the territory in question is concerned, cease to be under the obligation to protect the territory in question from forcible aggression by other States, inposed upon them by the above provlsIon%(January SO, 1919On February 3 the Artiole was submitted to the League of nations Commission of the Peace Conference, in the following form&quot;ARTICLE 27*The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and preserve as against escteroal aggression the territorial integrity and existing political inde-pendence of all States members of the League&quot;.(February 3, 1919).
274In the course of its tenth meeting, held onFebruary 13, 1919, the Commission adopted the proposal in thefollowing form:&quot;The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political Independence of all States members of the League.        In case of any such aggression, or in ease of any threat or danger of such aggression, the Executive Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.&quot;At the peace Conference the article was againslightly amended, its final text reading as follows:&quot;les Membres de la society*te&apos; &quot;The Members of the Leagues&apos;engagent a respecter et undertake to respect and$ maintenir contre touts preserve as against externalagression ext^rieure l*in- &quot; aggression the territorialtegriti territoriale et integrity and existing poli-1&apos;independance politique tical Independence of allpr^sente de tous les Members of the League.    InMembres de la Societe. case of any such aggression cEn cas degression, de in case of any threat or diin-menace ou de danger ger of such aggression, thed&apos;agression, le Conseil Council shall advise upon theavlse aux moyens dTassurer means by which this obliga-lTexdcution fie cette tion shall be fulfilled.&quot;obligation.&quot;The fundamental idea of Article 10 is as follows: Ho change can henceforth be made, by means of aggression, in the territorial integrity and political independence of States, which are essential elements of their international status;   such changes can only be made as a result of peaceful negotiation and by the helpful mediation.of the League of Nations.This involves for all Members of the League the twofold obligation of mutually respecting each other territorial integrity and existing political independence, and of maintaining these against all external aggression, either on the part of other Members of the League or on the part of States which are not Members.This legal conception constitutes one of the guiding principles of the League of nations.     In view of
the fact that war almost always has for its object some change in the territorial integrity or political independence of other states, the new rule of law expressed in Article 10 maices the League of nations an organisation for the maintenance of peace, which is called upon to safeguard the principle that no cnanges can he made in the territorial limits and political independence of states except as the result of peaceful negotiations and friendly mediation.We cannot, however, interpret Article 10 as unreservedly confirming the territorial status quo as it has been established by the last treaties of peace, and as future treaties will, perhaps establish it,The League of Nations neither could nor should assume responsibility for such a confirmation;    but the League of Nations can, and indeed should, if it desires to become a peaceful organisation of peoples and t0 contribute to the maintenance of world peace, adopt as its own the thesis that a state can no longer endeavour to establish by violence, that is to say by war, its claims to any territorial change whatsoever, however.justifiable these claims may appear to be.Although President Wilson, in the first draft which has been cjuoted above, laid down a special procedure and an extraordinary power for the League with respect to peaceful changes in territorial limits, he and the other authors of the Covenant understood that the general procedure laid down in Article 19 of .the Covenant, with regard to the revision of treaties which had become inapplicable and the consideration of international conditions the continuance of which might endanger tho peace of the world, would also be the best method of bringing about, by peaceful and rightful means, the
territorial changes which might seen necessary.If Article 10 is thus interpreted as a prohibition of any violation of the territorial and political status quo, which has been established by treaties, and as a guarantee against any such violation, it will be seen to embody the fundamental idea on which the succeeding articles of the Covenant are based.Article 10 contains the governing principle to which all Members of the League subscribe the methods of application and the legal means of enforcement thereof being laid down in the succeeding Articles.A State Member of the League which infringes the legal princiiole formulated in Article .10 and violates the territorial integrity and the political independence&apos; of one of its fellow-Members will find itself confronted by all the other Members of the League, who will have to fulfil their duty of maintaining the status quo against the wrongful act of violence.    Article 16 lays down in detail the obligations which rest upon the Members of the League in such a case.    In general the violation of the territorial integrity and political independence of a state can be regarded only as an act of war.    There are two possible cases: either the aggressor has committed the act of violation without having adopted the procedure laid down in Articles 12, 13 or 1J? of the Covenant.., which provide that. he must submit his claims to examination, in which case it is clear that he has committed an act of war contrary to the obligations formulated in these articles;    or he has first followed this procedure but his claims have been rejected by the application of the principle containedin Article 10, and of the principal which is expressed in paragraph eight of Article 15; if, in these circumstances, he still attempts to gain his end by violence, he will in this case- 5 - .        -
also be considered, in accordance with the provisions of Article 13, paragraph. 4, fend of Article lb, paragraph six, as a belli-gerent&apos;who has violated the obligations laid down in these Articles.     If the aggressor is not a State Member of the League, Article 1&quot; of the Covenant, by referring to Article l6, provides for the manner in which the Members of the League shall fulfil their duties.It appears, therefore, from the above, that the duty which is incumbent, upon the Members of the League to preserve against all external aggression the territorial integrity and political independence of all Members of the League, is explained and defined in Article l6: the Member State which has violated the territory of another Member State shall be considered to have committed an act of war against all the other Members of the*League.     The latter pledge themselves to sever immediately all trade or financial relations with this state, to prohibit all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the Covenant-breaking State, and to prevent all finaneialt oommer0ial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the $cvenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not.The Members are not obliged to take  iart in any military action.     It is true that Article 16 alludes to joint military action to be organised, on the recommendation Of the Council, by the several governments concerned;   but, in general, the Members are not legally bound to take part in such action. Paragraph three of the same article lays down, however, that tbe Members of the League shall take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of the Members of the League which are co-operating in the joint action,
When normal conditions have &quot;been re-established, the principle of Article 10 again becomes applicable; the territorial integrity and the political independence of the States Members of the League should &quot;be restored.It appears from the above that the obligation of the Members of.the League which is expressed in Article 10 of the Covenant, to preserve the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League^ is- to be found again in the obligations formulated in Article 16*It Is impossible to interpret Article 10 otherwise than as the basis of the obligations laid down in Article 16; that is to say it must be regarded as containing an obligation upon all.Members of the League to use every means in their power to prevent Violation of the territorial integrity and political independence of the other Members *The fundamental idea of the Covenant is by common endeavour to prevent any unjustifiable war; the nature and organisation of such endeavour are defined in Article 16. It is impossible to believe that the &quot;provisions relating to this united effort would not be applicable to cases where war would constitute a violation of the territorial integrity or political independence of a Member of the League, for if that were so-, these provisions would hardly over be applicable, since wars are almost always of that nature.Moreover, it is impossible to &quot;believe that the Covenant would, in Article 16, describe and minutely organ-ise the united effort against illicit war, and at the same time, in Article 10, would compel the Members of the League to engage in an indefinite and unorganised struggle against a State which had violated the territorial integrity and political independence of one of their number.m    7   .
It is true that Article 16 does not refer to Article 10 either expressly or by implication.   The explana-tion of this fact is that the authors of the Covenant oon-sidered that any violation of territorial integrity and of political independence would always be preceded by an act of war in contravention of the obligations arising out of Articles 12, 13 and 15.   There v/as, therefore, no necessity to refer to Article 10? and, as stated in the course of the preliminary diecussions, a reference to this Article might have been ambiguous.j        If, therefore, we desire to regard the Covenant as a logical and coherent whole, Articlesl6 and 17 must be read in the light of the fundamental principle contained in Article 10, namely, that Members are under an obligation to preserve the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members against any external aggression.The Committee considers that the Article applies to all oases of actual violation of the territorial integrity and political independence of a Member, even if the ultimate purpose of such violation is not the definite annexation of the territory or the diminution of the political independence of the Member.    One of the drafts quoted above might give the impression that its authors   had in mind only an act of aggression which was intended to inflict lasting injury upon the integrity of another State.    In the opinion of the Committee the wording which v/as adopted leaves no room for doubt that the ultimate intention of the agressor does not affect the issue; this intention would not, moreover, be known,, and would be liable.to modification during the course of the war.If the possibility is admitted that a violation Of the territorial integrity and political independence of a Member may take place, without the occurrence of an act of war -
the Committee has some doubt on this point - then Articles 16 and 17 would not apply.     What obligations would Article 10 impose upon Members of the League in such a case?     That is a very difficult question.     It is certain that, under such circumstances, each Member   would have to decide for itself, in accordance with the spirit of the Covenant, what action was incumbent upon it..     The Covenant, is not explicit on this point and does not specify any organ of the League as the competent authority to pronounce On the question.The second sentence of Article 10, which reads: &quot;In case Of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled,&quot; does not in any way modify the above conclusions.In the first place the Committee wishes to point out that there can be no doubt that the Council, under the terms of this Article, can. only advise as to the means to be employed, it cannot impose them.The relevant provision of Article 10 with regard to the Council&apos;s advice in the case of an act of aggression is merely an anticipation of the provisions of Article 16; this Is an awkwardness in drafting which is pardonable in a document like the Covenant.In so far as it deals with the threat or danger of aggression, this port ion of Article 10 has its -ass., for Members of the League will doubtless be glad to receive the advice of the Council    s to the measures which they ought to take in order to combat a pressing danger, even though they are entitled to decide for themselves whether, and to vhat extent, they feel called upon to follow the advice given.     In regard to this point, the effect of Article 10 is rather like that of the first paragraph of Article 11-9-
Finally, if it be asked whether the considerations set forth above do not lead to the conclusion that Article 10 duplicates Articles 16 and 17 of the Covenant, the answer is in the negative.Although Article 10 lays down no general rule of procedure and contains no obligation which cannot be found elsewhere in the Covenant, it nevertheless possesses a certain value of its own.      It enunciates one of the legal principles upon which the League of Nations Is based, namely,  the principle of mutual respect for and preservation of the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all members of the League.      This Is a governing principle to be observed, not only by the Members in their relation with one another, but also by the organs of the League, whenever they are called upon to exert their influence or authority in any way for the settlement of. disputes or for the maintenance or restoration of the peace of the world.
