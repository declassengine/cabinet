SURVEY   OF   THE   WEEK.Several important trade union conferences have been held during the week, in the addresses at these conferences the waning faith of labour in the strike weapon was further demonstrated^The Triple Alliance did not attract the attention that was expected at the annual conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Grreat,Britain, although the Executive Committees-report was a practical confession, of the impotence of the Alliance. Mr. Herbert Smith made a.very frank avowal of the unwisdom of many features of the miners&apos; policy up to and during the recent stoppage, and the Executive Committee&apos;s report revealed that it was the political implications of the National Pool that prevented the railwaymen and transport workers from joining the miners. The strictly industrial resolutions passed were noticeably mild, a number of &quot; advanced &quot; resolutions being shelved.Dissatisfaction with the policy of the Miners&apos; Federation has resulted in a proposal of the National Federation of Colliery Surfacemen to secede from that body.The settlement of the shipyard joiners&apos; dispute leaves the industrial field clear of important. strikes. The situation in the chemical trade, however, is causing some anxiety, and unless an agreement is effected a stoppage of some 30,000 workpeople is likely next week.The slow improvement in the unemployment position is maintained. The estimated total of the live register of all Employment Exchanges on the 19th August was 1,640,600 as compared with 1,685,500 the estimated number on the 12th August, and with 1,615,000 the corresponding figure for the first week of the recent dispute.   -At the final meeting of the Agricultural Wages Board held on 23rd August the proposed reduction in wages of 6s. a week, with a minimum of 42s. a week, was confirmed.(34490-31)  wt. 74-r 5 300 8/21 h. st. g 99/8
features   of   the   week.General Topics.Railways Act. This Act which was introduced into the House of Commons on the 11th May, has passed its remaining stages and received the Royal Assent on the 19th August. The proposals contained in Part IV of the Act, which deals with the wages and conditions of service of railway employees, a summary of which was given in this Report for 21st May last (Vol. Ill, No. 21, p. 432) have now undergone certain modifications. The Act provides that the Central and National Wages Boards shall be continued at least until the 1st January, 1924, i.e., a year later than was at first proposed. The details of the constitution of the Boards have now been settled as follows : (a) The Central Wages Board is to be composed oi: eight representatives of the railway companies and eight representatives of the railway employees. The employees&apos; representatives are to be appointed by the railway trade unions, four by the National Union of railwaymen, two by the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and two by the Railway Clerks&apos; Association.(b) The National Wages Board is to be composed of six representatives of the rail-way companies, six representatives of the railway employees, two appointed by each of the three unions mentioned above, and four representatives of the users of railways, with an independent chairman nominated by the Minister of Labour. The four representatives of the users of railways shall be nominated by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the Co-operative Union, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of British Industries, respectively.A new clause (clause 67) has been added which provides for the establishment, fory each railway company affected, of a conference o  an equal number of representatives of the company and of the members of the police force of that company to which all questions of wages, hours, and conditions of service of the police shall be referred with an appeal to a central conference In the event of disagreement between the two sides of the central conference, which is to consist of representatives of the companies and the police force, elected from the conferences of the separate railways, an independent chairman shall be appointed with power to give binding decisions. The chairman is to be selected by mutual agreement, or, failing agreement, to be nominated by the Minister of Labour.Corn Production Acts (Repeal) Act. On the 17th August the House of Lords considered the House ot Commons&apos; reason for disagreeing to their amendment limiting the powers of the conciliation committees to the regulation of wages and hours, and the amendment was not pressed. As regards the amendment of the House of Commons to leave out the phrase &quot;or in respect/of a period exceeding six weeks&quot; at the end of sub-section (4) (see last week&apos;s Report) the House of Lords proposed to substitute the words &quot; and a person shall not be entitled to recover under the sub-section wages for more than three months or for such longer period not exceeding one year as the court in which proceedings are taken for the recovery of the wages shall consider just.&quot; This was agreed to by tbe House of Commons and the Bill received the Royal Assent on the 19th August.The Malton Branch of the National Farmers&apos; Union, at a meeting on the 20th August, passed a resolution demanding that there should be no conciliation or wages boards controlled by the Government. A meeting of the South Northumberland District Committee of the National Union of Agricultural Workers has passed a resolution in favour of acting &quot; in hearty co-operation with the employers in setting up a. conciliation committee for the whole county of Northumberland.&quot;The Shops (Early Closing) Act (1920) Amendment Act. This Act was amended in Committee in the House of Commons, on the 17th August, to allow the extension of the hours of sale of fruit and table-waters as well as of sweets, ice-cream, etc. It then passed through its remaining stages in both Houses without further amendment and received the Royal Assent on the 19th August.The Expiring Laws Continuance Act and the Lish Railways (Settlement of Claims) &apos; Act, which were referred to in this Report last week, also received the Royal Assent on the same date.The Cost of Living. Referring to criticisms by a correspondent of the strictures passed upon the Ministry, of Labour&apos;s prices index number in the final Report of the Joint Labour Committee on the Cost of Living, the New Statesman for the 13th August says : &quot; We are bound to say that (the correspondents) criticisms appear to us
34490to be wholly justified.&quot; It suggests, however, that the report &quot; notwithstanding its blunders &quot; supports the demand for an early reconsideration of the basis of the official index figure.The Manchester Guardian of the 17th August, after explaining the meaning of the Ministry of Labour figures, proceeds &quot; The Labour party, it is true, have recently challenged the official figures in a formal report, but, although there is in it no such gross misapprehension of the meaning and uses of an average, even this report has been shown to have contained serious scientific inaccuracies. These will probably discredit the report as a whole. Perhaps it is as well. If a Government Department which has the best available sources of information cannot be trusted to compile the figures accurately, it can be trusted for nothing else. And if serious error could be proved, the confusion into which numerous trade agreements would be thrown would be past unravelling.&quot;Further criticism of the Ministry of Labour&apos;s figures has been offered by the Cardiff branch of the Railway Clerks Association. While asking their headquarters to take strong exception to the official figure, they also passed a resolution calling for immediate increases in the salaries of railway clerks and supervisors, and requesting the executive to formulate a new programme without delay.The Bethnal Green branch of the National Union of Railwaymen has supported a resolution of the Hackney branch that the official index figure should be investigated in view of the decision by the Joint Labour Committee that it is too low. The branch pointed out that on the basis of the official figure, the last revision of railway rates meant to the men a loss of 5.?. per week.A proposal that the Joint Labour Committee&apos;s figure, or a modified official figure, should be adopted as a basis for the future regulation of wages, which was made by the workers&apos; side of the West Riding&apos; Provisional Joint Council for Local Authorities Non-Trading Services, is referred to under Demands and Negotiations below.Manifesto on Trade Union Policy. A manifesto has been published addressed to organised Labour in this country and signed by seventeen members of Parliament, among whom are the Rt. Hon. G. N. Barnes, the Rt. Hon. G. H. Roberts, Sir Fortescue Flannery, and several prominent members of the National Democratic and Labour Party. The signatories consider that &quot; one of the greatest paradoxes of the time is that, owing to the activity of a small minority within the trade union movement, the word &apos; trade-unionism &apos; is coming to have a significance which is far from being desired by the rank and file,&quot; who are not in favour either of a policy of &quot; direct action &quot; or an economic revolution. They exhort the workers to realise the futility and danger of &quot;prolonged strike action,&quot; and to look to a policy of increased production in industry, the development of foreign trade, and reliance on constitutional Parliamentary action for the advancement of their welfare. By these means, the ruin of industry and the danger to the nation from the spread of subversive doctrines may be averted.Ex-Service Men. A demonstration was held in Trafalgar- Square, on the 20th August, by ex-Service men who are being trained in the Government centres in the north and north-west of London. The demands put forward by the meeting were :  (1) The immediate reinstatement of all trainees who have been discharged from training centres under the period of their training promised by the Government. (2) All trainees to be paid back pay lost through discharge from training centres, less unemploy-ment pay received or pension. (3) No trainees to be discharged from training centres until such time as the Ministry can place them with employers as laid down in training&apos; regulations.A deputation it is stated will proceed to the Prime Ministers house after a second demonstration which has been fixed for the 17th September.Unemployment. In the House of Commons, on the 17th August, the Minister of Health referred to the work of the Cabinet Committee upon unemployment of which he is now chairman.Despite the fact that the lowest point of trade depression, as reflected in the unem-ployment figures, appears to have passed, local authorities are faced with the 2)roblem of finding relief for persons whose unemployment insurance benefit has expired or is about to do so. The burden of unemployment is felt chiefly in those districts which are least able to meet the accompanying financial difficulties, and this state of affairs has given rise to much criticism of what a Poplar councillor calls &quot; the infamous system of rating.&quot;From a number of quarters a demand is being made for an extension of the period during which benefit may be drawn.
Industrial Organisations.Trades Union Congress. The amendments to the resolutions sent in for consideration at the Trades Union Congress* have been issued. Of these the most important may be summarised as follows :The National Union of Railwaymen gave notice of a motion expressing regret at the attitude of the Amalgamated Engineering Union in refusing to associate themselves with the National Union of Railwaymen in conducting negotiations for railway shopmen. To this the Amalgamated Engineering Union has tabled an amendment drawing attention to a resolution of the Congress in 1915 declaring that &quot; any method of organisation that seeks to divide workmen from their fellows in the same occupation is detrimental to the best interests of trade unionism &quot; and expressing the opinion that the refusal of the National Union to give effect to this decision is the cause of the present misunderstanding.To a motion on co-operation between unions an amendment is proposed that it shall be obligatory upon all unions affiliated to Congress to report to the Parliamentary Committee and take counsel with all kindred unions affected in regard to industrial action contemplated or precipitated by their members.The present policy of trade unions in the conduct of industrial disputes is already the subject of an important resolution by the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, and to this the following amendment will be moved by the General Workers Union : &quot; That this Congress expresses its readiness to discuss with organised employers through the medium of the proper and recognised national bodies the policy of applying the voluntary decisions of trade unions and employers to such employers of labour as may fail to carry out the voluntary decisions arrived at.&quot;Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain. The annual conference of the Miners&apos; Federation took place at Llandudno on the 17th, 18th and 19th August. Mr. Herbert Smith officiated as acting president,The meeting was notable for the prevalence of the view that the policy pursued by the Federation had resulted in failure and was impossible to maintain. The president, in his opening address, attributed this to the fact that the economic power given to the industry by war was not so, strong in peace, and referred in pointed terms to the gradual failure of the policy of the Federation since the previous annual conference. A. year ago saw the miners declining to work the Mining Industry Act because it embodied the principle of district regulation of wages and a departure from the methods of unification established under control. This conference saw them with a unanimous vote from the districts in favour of working the Act, and they were also parties to an agreement which definitely .re-established district arrangements. The wages cuts proposed in connection with decontrol were enormous, but the Federation never gave the Triple Alliance the opportunity of fighting with it on the one question they had most in common i.e., the wages issue. The withdrawal of the safety men was a further error : it aroused resentment in the Alliance,, and turned public opinion against the miners.The report of the executive committee was read by Mr. Hodges and followed the same lines as the presidents address. The; Alliance feared the political implication of the pool, especially when they realised that the Government were prepared to have a general election on the issue. The opinion was expressed that the Triple Alliance could not function, and never would function, until each party was affected simultaneously by the same question or had the same claims maturing at the same moment and that capitalism was far too astute to allow common grievances to mature together. Discussion of the report was taken in private, but it was accepted unanimously.On the following day resolutions were carried urging the passing of legislation on the lines of the recommendations of the Holman Gregory Report on Workmen&apos;s Compensation ; in support of the nationalisation of the coalmining industry, the necessity for pithead baths, and the introduction of a fortnights holiday with pay. There was a discussion in private on several district resolutions demanding a maximum working week in all districts of five shifts ; a national six-hour working day and the abolition of the piece-work system. It was decided to allow these demands to stand over for the present owing to the economic position of the industry.&apos;On the 19th the conference discussed in private a motion from South Wales that a bare majority of the members of the Federation, instead of the present two-thirds, taking* See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 7, 13th August, p. 71.
part in a ballot vote should be the determining factor in declaring or cancelling a strike. The motion was remitted to the executive council as was also a further resolution from Lancashire and Cheshire that there should be a complete revision of the rules of the Federation.&apos; It was agreed that the Federation should finance its members of Parliament up to the quota given to the districts under the Parliamentary scheme of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain if the candidate had been adopted by the Federation.It was decided that Mr. Herbert Smith should remain acting-president, and that the districts should consider the question of reverting to a part-time presidency. Mr. W. P. Richardson, of Durham, was appointed treasurer and Messrs. Frank Hodges and F. B. Varley were nominated for the Labour Party Executive. The new executive was constitued as follows : Messrs. Frank Hall (Derbyshire), T. H. Cann and Peter Lee (Durham), C. Thompson, H. Dack, A. Hassell, Stephen Walsh, M.P., and T. Brown (Lancashire and Cheshire), Wm. Johnson and Samuel Finney, M.P. (Midland Federation), Wm. Stoker (Northum-berland), G. A. Spencer, M.P. (Nottinghamshire), J. Sullivan and A. Clark (Scotland), Enoch Morrell, Tom Richards, Noah Abblett and A. J. Cook (S. Wales), S. Roebuck ancl J. Potts (Yorkshire).National Federation of General Workers. The annual conference of the Federation opened at Blackpool on the 18th August under the presidency of Mr. J. R. Clynes. His opening address, in common with recent speeches by other trade union leaders, emphasised a new belief in the futility of strike action. Referring to the failure of the Triple Alliance to support the miners in the coal dispute, he said that huge masses of men were not likely to respond to any signal which a group of officials, or a committee, might be disposed to give them ; and it was clear that men would not engage in a risky strike to fight for anything for which they were not ready to vote.Resolutions were moved charging the Government with failure to take action to prevent the great industrial depression from which the country is suffering and to deal adequately with the relief of the unemployed, and signifying disapproval of the Governments foreign policy.Other resolutions carried included one moved by Mr. Will Thorne, M.P., advocating the eventual formation of one large union for all workers, although this might not; be possible at present, and one pledging the conference to support the efforts of the agricultural workers&apos; unions to maintain the Agricultural Wages Boards.The chairman&apos;s suggestion that a delegation from the conference should discuss with the chemical trade employers the difference already considered by the Chemical Trades Joint Industrial Council was also agreed, the conference being of opinion &quot; that neither the result of the ballot, nor the employers&apos; threat- to close down their works, justify the present deadlock.&quot;   The rest of the proceedings were conducted in private.Mr. Clynes was re-elected president and Mr. T. W. Bell vice-president.The National Federation of Colliery Enginemen and Boilermen held a conference at Southport on the 23rd August. It was unanimously decided to take a ballot of members as to whether they wish to continue affiliation with the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain on the present basis. It was further decided that if the ballot results in a majority for discontinuing the affiliation the executive shall be instructed to endeavour to come to a working arrangement which shall not involve a continuance of the present dictation to the Enginemen by the Miners&apos; Federation.The National Federation of Building Trades Operatives. This Federation opened its annual conference at Perth on the 17th August under the presidency of Mr. George Hicks. Apart from the presidential address, the proceedings of the conference were conducted in private. Mr. Hicks issued a warning against undue readiness to embark on strikes. With regard to future trouble, he expressed the opinion that some of the employers wished to provoke a national dispute on the question of dilution, but, although to the public it would appear to be a struggle between employers and the union on the question of ex-Service men, the real struggle would be on piece-work and the extension of the present working week. He referred to the work of the Wages and Conditions Council established last March and emphasised the necessity for safeguarding hours as well as wages. Such things as dilution, payment by results and the length of the working week should be decided by the Council.
negotiations and disputes.demands and negotiations.Shipyard Workers (National). &apos; .The Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation who issued a notice to the Federation of: Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades intimating their intention to discontinue from the 1st September, the Ministry of Munitions bonuses of 124- per cent, to time-workers, and 7J per cent, to piece-workers employed in shipyards, are now reported to have withdrawn the notice pending a conference between the parties, which is expected to be held early in September. It will be remembered that in the engineers&apos; settlement in July,* it was also agreed that a meeting should be held in September to discuss the withdrawal of these bonuses in the case of engineering workers.Railwaymen (Ireland). rlt will be remembered that, at a recent session of the Irish Trades Union Congress3, a resolution was passed protesting against proposed wages reductions announced by the Irish railway companies.fA conference was held at the Ministry of Transport on the 5th August between representatives of the Irish railway companies and the railway unions, at the close of which Mr. J. II. Thomas, M.P., made a statement to the effect that various proposals were made and agreed to by all the railway companies with the exception of the Great Northern (Ireland). Negotiations were resumed in Dublin on the 8th and 9th August and as a result it was agreed that a tribunal consisting of five members appointed by the unions and five members appointed by the railway companies, under an indepen-dent chairman to be nominated by the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, be set up to decide (1) whether the principle of standardisation of wages and conditions should be adopted and (2) whether a universal eight-hour day should be maintained on Irish railways. It was further agreed that the companies be at liberty to make the first reduction in salaries and wages immediately. The intention is to reduce salaries and wages to 160 per cent, over pre-war rates in the case of the larger companies and to 100 per cent, over pre-war rates in the case of the smaller companies.. The tribunal sat for the first time on the 22nd August in Dublin, Mr. William Corrigan, K.C., presiding. The&apos; men were represented by Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P. (National Union of Railwaymen), Mr. Bromley (Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen) and Mr. Walkden (Railway Clerks&apos;Association). Mr. M. F. Keogh, general manager of the Midland Great Western Railway, is acting as advocate for the companies.   The Great Northern Railway of Ireland is not a party to the proceedings.Envelope and Manufactured Stationery Employees (National). With reference to the proposed reductions in wages in this industry J the first reduction of 5s. per week has now been enforced by the employers. Some 50 members of the National Union of Printing and Paper Workers employed by Messrs. W. H. Smith &amp; Son,;London, struck wrork on the loth August claiming that they came under the union&apos;s agreement with the Federation of Master Printers and not under the Stationery Section. The firm maintained that the stationery reduction is applicable and although a provisional settlement was reached on the evening of the same day, it is understood that negotiations are still in progress.The opposition of the National Union of Printing and Paper Workers, however, to the second and third reductions proposed by the stationery employers continues, and negotiations are still in progress with the Employers&apos; Federation of Envelope Makers and Manufacturing Stationers. It is considered unlikely that the second of the three reductions, 2s. 6d. a week, will be contested in view of the provisional settlement on the same basis reached in the printing industry, but some compromise is probable with regard to the third reduction, a further 2s. 6d. weekly, originally demanded by the stationery employers.Woodworkers (South Wales). Reports are now to hand of the continuance of friction in South Wales owing to the objection of members of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers to fix joinery imported from Sweden. Following upon an interview between the chief labour adviser and a deputation from the society which was held early in July, the national executives of employers and operatives met and agreed to recommend a settlement to the South Wales and Monmouthshire Joint Industrial Council in the following terms : (a) That the South Wales employers should, in future, only buy goods for which they had received an assurance from the merchants that they had been made by a firm approved by the* See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 4, 23rd July, p. 50. f See this Report Vol. IV, No. 7, 13th August, p. 72. &apos; I See this Report, Vol. IV, No. 7, 13th August, p. 73.
Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers ; (b) that the South Wales operatives should fix doors already bought, which were satisfactorily shown to have been made by such firms ; (c) that the national council should meet at an early date with a view to a national settlement of the question. These terms were, however, rejected by the workers&apos; side of the council on the ground that, in view of the autonomy of the branches of the society, the dispute must be settled locally in accordance with district rules.The matter was reported to the half-yearly meeting of the National Federation of Building Trades Employers, which was held in Sheffield from the 26th to the 28th July, when the meeting resolved to support the national federation in any action which might be deemed necessary, even to the extent of taking a ballot on a lockout, in support of the principle that the master builders are entitled to purchase their goods and carry on their-business without dictation from the operatives.Chemical Workers - National.&apos; -With reference to the proposed reduction of wages by 2d. per hour referred to in last week&apos;s issue of this Report a meeting of the Joint Industrial Council for the industry was held at Montagu House on 23rd August, when after a protracted session the conference broke down. The workers&apos; representatives had offered to accept an immediate reduction of Id. per hour and to meet the employers again on the 28th October to consider the question of a further reduction of Id. per hour. The employers refused this proposal and a further suggestion from the workers to accept a \\d. per hour reduction with no further reduction until June 1922 was also refused.   The employers also refused to submit the matter to arbitration.It is understood that further efforts of mediation were made at a late hour on the 23rd August and it is hoped that a way out of the deadlock may yet be found.Co-operative Wholesale Society Employees (National). As indicated in last week&apos;s issue of this Report, the wages committee of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, on the 17th August, received a deputation from the various unions affected by. the proposed wages reduction of 10 per cent. The Directors of the society, after considering the report of their wages committee, have now announced that they are prepared to effect this reduction in two instalments of 5 per cent, each, the first to take place from the 22nd August, and the second from the 26th September.It is reported that these proposals have been rejected, and that the workpeople are seeking another interview with the directors of the society.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services (Manual Workers) (West Riding). -The workers&apos; side of the West Riding Provincial Council held a meeting at Sheffield on the 11th August, when it was decided to adopt the principle of regulating wages by a cost-of-living sliding scale. They declined, however, to accept the proposals for such a scale which had been submitted by the employers&apos; side of the council, and after discussion it was agreed to submit counter-proposals to the employers. In these counter-proposals is included a suggestion that the future regulation be in accordance with the figure sub-mitted by the Joint Labour Committee on the Cost of Living, or &quot; such figure as may be arrived at after the findings of this Committee have been considered by the GoA^ernment, and published in the Labour Gazette.&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;The matter is to be considered further on the 26th August.Settlements and Agreements.Painters and Plumbers (Creive). The strike of painters and plumbers at Crewe, referred to in last week&apos;s issue of this Report, has been settled and the men returned to work on the 1 7th August.Shipyard Joiners (National). As indicated in last week&apos;s issue of this Report, this dispute, which began on the 4th December 1920,* has been settled as the result of an agreement between the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the executive council of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, and, where possible, work is to be resumed forthwith.There is to be an immediate reduction in wages of 6s. per week, with a further reduction of 3s. per week hi October. In December, the question of another reduction of 3s. per week, together with other matters, will be discussed.Reports indicate that work is being resumed on the Clyde and at the Tees and Tyne shipyards. At Liverpool the men are still out, but work is reported to have been resumed at Birkenhead.* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 23, 4th December, p. 634, and Vol. II, No. 24,11th December, p. 658.

E.2.China Clay Industry (National). An agreement has been arrived at by the Joint Industrial Council for the China Clay Industry, whereby wages are stabilised until the 31st December next. The new standard rate for time-workers is Is. Sd. per hour, which represents a reduction of od. per hour on the present rate, and there are corresponding reductions for other classes of workers.Dock Labourers (Preston). A strike of some 300 dock labourers took place at Preston on the 4th August arising out of the interpretation of a clause in the recent national agreement regarding the wages of dock labourers.^ The employers contended that a revision of piece-work prices should take place, as had been the case when increases had been granted. The union&apos;s contention, on the other hand, was that the piece prices should remain as at present, and that the 2s. should be taken off a day&apos;s earnings. The employers would not agree to this, and stated that the only alternative to their inter -pretation was to put the men on day rates. On their attempting to do this the men struck work. They resumed, however, the next day, on the employers&apos; conditions, i.e., that piece-work rates should be revised to give the men a reduction equivalent to 2s. at the end of the day.STATISTICAL.   APPENDIX.Employment Exchanges.The Unemployment Position. On the 12th&apos;August, in the United Kingdom 1,697,088 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and out-of-work donation policies, remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,341,729 were lodged by males and 355,359 by females. At the same date, 470,311 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 245,902 were lodged by males and 224,209 by females.These figures show a decrease on the previous week of 48,186 totally unemployed and 18,506 working short time.The following table shows the work of the Exchanges in respect of registrations, vacancies and placings during the week ending the 12th August :
