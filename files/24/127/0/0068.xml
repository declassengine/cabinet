W.-E.The War Office,29thAugust, 1921.1. Situation before the commencement of the Greek advance.The situation on 9th July, L921, immediately prior to the present operations, may be summarized as follows: The Greek Army was divided into two main groups, a Northern Group round Brusa and&apos;a Southern Group in the Ushak area. The composition of these armies, exclusive of line of communication troops, was as follows : Northern Front   ...       ...&quot; Illrd Corps :-3rd, 7th, 10 th and 11th(Brusa area) . Divisions (18,000 rifles).Southern Front   ...       ...   1st Corps : Cavalry Brigade, j(Usbak area) 1st, 2nd and 12th Divisions. I 33,500Ilnd Corps : 4th,  5th, 9th f rifles, and 13th Divisions.The Turkish Nationalist Army was similarly subdivided into two main groups, the principal differences being : (a.) That the Turks had concentrated a large force in the Kutaya- Eskishehr area, a central position, facing the gap between the Greek Northern and Southern Fronts.(6.) That a part of the Turkish force was in the Ismid Adabazar area, which had previously been evacuated by the Greeks.The Turkish Nationalist forces immediately available were believed to be distributed as follows : Northern front      ...       ...       ...   Six divisions.(Sea to Eskishehr, exclusive.) One cavalry division.(23,000 rifles.) Southern front      ...       ...       ...   Ten divisions.(South of Eskishehr, inclusive.)      Two cavalry divisions.(25,000 rifles.) West of Angora    ...       ...       ..    Three divisions.One cavalry division. (8,000 rifles.)In addition, it was considered that the following divisions might be made available later : From Cilicia ...       ...       ...   Two divisions (5,000 rifles).From Amasia area (170 miles East   Three divisions.of Angora). Two cavalry divisions..  . - (6,500 rifles and sabres.)Note. In comparing Greek and Turkish divisions&quot; it must be remembered that Greek divisions are considerably stronger, averaging 4,500 rifles, as compared with an average strength of less than 3,000 rifles in a Turkish division.(B21/285)   70   8/21   h&amp;s, Ltd.   9422wo
The Greek plan of operations is given in Appendix A. It is shown graphically&apos; on Map A. &quot;It will be seen from the map that, so long as the Greek Army continued to operate on two fronts (Brusa and Ushak), the central position of the Turkish forces about Kutaya gave the Turks all the advantages of being able to operate on interior lines. The capture of Kutaya was, therefore, the first main objective of these operations. As the results of aeroplane reconnaissances had shown that the Turkish positions covering Kutava were facing south and south-west, the Greeks decided to attack from north-west and south-east, so as to roll up these positions from the flanks.In order to facilitate this operation three preliminary operations were planned :: (a.) Two divisions of the Greek IHrd Corps were ordered to attack due east from Brusa, starting three days before the main operation, with a view to retaining as many Turkish divisions as possible in the Bilejik Seugud &apos; Kovalija area.(b.) The other two divisions of the Greek IHrd Corps were ordered to advance south-east on Harmanjik, en route for Kutaya, starting three days before the main operation.(c.) Three divisions, with the Greek Cavalry Brigade attached, were entrusted with the capture of Afium Karahissar.3. Narrative of the Main Operations.The operations in the south commenced on 12th July. Afium Karahissar was captured on the following day, and one division, the 4th, was left to hold the town against attack from the east.The main operation against Kutaya was immediately commenced with five Greek divisions moving astride the Afium Karahissar Eskishehr railway.On 13th July the situation was as follows : (a.) The main Greek attack continued its advance along the railway, meeting with little opposition.(/;.) The 9th Greek Division, advancing north-east from Ushak, remained at Gediz.(c.) The 7th and 10th Greek Divisions from Brusa continued their advance on Kutaya.(d.) The 3rd and 11th Greek divisions reached the line Bazarjik Bilejik.By the evening of 15th July, the Greek main attack had reached the line of the stream at Point 1020, north of Altumtash (see Map A). In this neighbourhood, the heaviest fighting, so far reported, took place. The Turks counter-attacked the Greek 5th Division, but were eventually repulsed, and the advance continued. On the 17th July, the main Greek attack reached Kutaya. The 10th Greek Division, from Brusa, entered the town from the north-west and the 9th Division entered from the south.The Turks retreated north-east on Eskishehr. Captured Turkish orders tend to show that they avoided a decisive battle and that the retirement was carried out methodically and well. Cavalry were left behind to cover it. The Greeks claim.to have captured many prisoners and guns.The Greeks lost no time in following up their success. Five divisions were directed to follow the line of the railway to Eskishehr, while two other divisions, the 5th and 13th, were moved to the right flank and directed, via Seidi Ghazi, on the enemy&apos;s line of retreat east of Eskishehr. The Greek 12th Division was ordered to advance between these two columns in order to maintain touch.By 19th July, the Greek main attack, advancing with remarkable speed, was nearing Eskishehr. It was then learnt that the main Turkish position lay east of the town. Several minor- encounters with Turkish rear guards had taken place. On the night of 19th/20th&apos; July, the 5th and 13th Greek Divisions were held up south of Seidi Ghazi, but this check appears to have been only temporary.On 20th July, the Greek main attack occupied Eskishehr, and it appeared probable that the Turks intended to give battle in their position east of the town. The Greek Army was directed on to the line Hamidie Ak Punar.On 21st July the Turkish Army attacked the Greeks north, east and south of Eskiskehr. The Greeks responded with - a decisive counter-attack and the Turkish Army was repulsed all along the fine.
At least 11 Turkish divisions took part in this attack and the Turks evidently made a determined attempt to hold up the Greek advance.On 22nd July the Greek Army was ordered to the line Kemikli Maden  Kishmet Keui with the 1st Corps to Seidi Ghazi.&apos; The Greeks took up this line, and the Turks occupied the line Sivri Hissar  Muhalich.Since this date the Greek troops have remained more or less stationary.A report dated 29th July states that the front line runs as shown on Map B.The Greek Headquarters are at Kutaya and the Turkish Headquarters were at Sheikh Ali, 5 miles E.S.E. of Polatli, on 26th July. The Turkish 12th Group is reported to have moved to the Yildiz area on 27th July from the Sivri Hissar area. This and other information points to the possibility that the Turks will abandon the Sivri Hissar Muhalich line. Tt is reported by the British liaison officer that the Greeks do not intend to resume the offensive before 13th August.4. Narrative of Subsidiary Operations.(a.) In the north, a certain amount of indecisive fighting took place in the Yenishehr Bilejik area. The Greek 11th Division appears to have been driven back at one period, while the Greek 3rd Division defeated two Turkish Divisions and two Turkish cavalry regiments on another occasion. The Greek 3rd Division has now established itself on the railway at In Eunu, and the 11th Division is in the Bilejik area.(b.) In the south the Turkish Xth group was reported to be threatening the Greek southern lines of communication. On 20th-July Turks were reported at Serai Keui (vide south-west corner of Map A). Captured Turkish documents indicated that part of this group, which was believed to consist of a Turkish cavalry division and an infantry division, plus irregulars, was in the neighbourhood of Chivril, and that these troops &apos;had received orders to attack &apos;the Greek communications between Ortakdje (see south-west corner of Map A) and Ushak on 21st July. These troops were opposed by portions of the 9th Greek Division and the 18th Independent Regiment. They appear to have driven back the Turks and to have restored the safety of the southern communications. The Greek 4th Division at A nun Karahissar is in touch with portions of the Xth Turkish group in that area.5. The Greek Supply and Transport Situation has been greatly facilitated by the presence of large quantities of local supplies. The Kutaya bakeries are already turning out 35,000 bread rations daily. &quot;The railway workshops at Eskishehr appear to have been left undamaged.It is understood that the Greeks intend to re-occupy Ismid in order to open up a railway to Eskishehr and thus shorten their lines of communication by basing themselves on Ismid. It is estimated that in view of the damage done to the railway bridges and tunnels between Arifie (junction 6 miles south of Adabazar) and Bilejik, some months must elapse before the line will be in good working order.In the meantime, they have an auxiliary base at Mudania with a light railway running forward from Brusa as far as Kestel. From this latter place&apos; to Bilejik is only 40 miles by a reasonably good road, fit for mechanical transport. &apos; The railway from Bilejik to Eskishehr is already reported to be in working order.The Greeks hope that the lines Eskishehr-Alpi, Keui and Eskishehr Kutaya will be working by 13th August. The estimate regarding the latter line is considered optimistic.The Greek supply arrangements appear to be working satisfactorily and their army is now served by three lines as follows : (a.) From Brusa to Kara Keui by road, thence by rail to Eski-shehr.    Thissection of railway is reported to be in good working order. (b.) From Ushak to Kutaya via Gedis by road, (c.) From Ushak to Kutaya vid Altun Tash by rail and road.6. Moral.Liaison officers report that the Greek moral is good and that the Greek troops have shown splendid powers of endurance.The British Military Representative at Greek headquarters reports that the Turkish moral is now low.(9422)
At least 11 Turkish divisions took part in this attack and the Turks evidently made a determined attempt to hold up the Greek advance.On 22nd July the Greek Army was ordered to the line Kemikli Maden -Kishmet Keui with the 1st Corps to Seidi Ghazi.&apos; The Greeks took up this line, and the Turks occupied the line Sivri Hissar  Muhalich.Since this date the Greek troops have.remained more or less stationary.A report dated 29th July states that the front line inns as shown on Map B.The Greek Headquarters are at Kutaya and the Turkish Headquarters were at Sheikh Ali, 5 miles E.S.E. of Polatli, on 26th July. The Turkish 12th Group is reported to have moved to the Yildiz area on 27th July from the Sivri Hissar area. This and other information points to the possibility that the Turks will abandon the Sivri Hissar Muhalich line. It is reported by the British liaison officer that the Greeks do not intend to resume the offensive before 13th August.4. Narrative of Subsidiary Operations,(a.)

The Greek 3rd Division has now established itself on the railway at In Eunu, and the 11th Division is in the Bilejik area.(b.) In the south the Turkish Xth group was reported to be threatening the Greek southern lines of communication. On 20th-July Turks were reported at Serai Keui (vide south-west corner of Map A). Captured Turkish documents indicated that part of this group, which was believed to consist of a Turkish cavalry division and an infantry division, plus irregulars, was in the neighbourhood of Chivril, and that these troops &apos;had received orders to attack &quot;the Greek communications between Ortakdje (see south-west corner of Map A) and Ushak on 21st July. These troops were opposed by portions of the 9th Greek Division and the 18th Independent Regiment. They appear to have driven back the Turks and to have restored the safety of the southern communications. The Greek 4th Division at Afiun Karahissar is in touch with portions of the Xth Turkish group in that area.5. The Greek Supply and Transport Situation has been greatly facilitated by the presence of large quantities of local supplies. The Kutaya bakeries are already turning out 35,000 bread rations daily.

From Ushak to Kutaya vid Altun Ttish by rail and road.6. Moral.Liaison officers report that the Greek moral is good and that the Greek troops have shown splendid powers of endurance.The British Military Representative at Greek headquarters reports that the Turkish moral is now low.(94,22)
5th August, 1921.Reports on this subject are conflicting and it is difficult to arrive at any exact estimate. It is known that the Greek 5th, 7th and 12th Divisions suffered fairly severely.The French Military Authorities estimate the casualties at 10,000 killed and wounded on each side.The British liaison officer with the Greeks says that the total Greek casualties are about 6,000.    .He estimates the Turkish losses at Killed.....................2,000&quot;Wounded     ............&apos;   ...       ...   6,000Prisoners      ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...   4,000It is known that the 3rd Caucasus, the 23rd and the 41st Divisions have suffered very heavily.8. Higher Command.It is reported that King Constantine has taken over command of the Army from General Papoulas and. that he is now at General Headquarters, Kutaya. He visited Eskishehr on 22nd July.9. Comments on the situation from reports received up to 5th August, 1921.(a.) It is still difficult to estimate accurately the present condition of the Nationalist Army, but the following factors must be considered : -(1.) That the Turks permitted the Greeks to make a long advance over difficult country.(2.) That although the Turks were content to evacuate Kutaya without forcing x .        a decisive action, their attack east of Eskishehr on 21st July, 1921, showsthat they wished to hold up the Greek advance there, and were unableto do so.(3.) That 11 divisions took part in heavy fighting on 21st July and were defeated all along the line.From the above it appears obvious that the Turks have suffered a defeat and have been forced back further and faster than they desired. This cannot fail to have had an adverse effect on their moral.Whether the lull in the operations will give the Nationalist Army time to recover its moral and reorganize remains to be seen.Recent reports show that the Nationalist Army is still in being and that the Greeks expect heavy fighting when they move forward.An estimate of the present strength of the Nationalist troops is given in Appendix B.(b.) The Greek Army, on the other hand, has carried out a difficult operation successfully and has disposed of the counter attacks which the Turks put up to stop it. Its lines of supply are sufficiently secure. It may, therefore, be considered that the moral of the Greek Army is high and that after resting and refitting they will be capable of resuming the offensive.(c.) The courses open to the Turks are (1.) To seek a decisive encounter with the Greeks.(2.) To hold a series of rear guard positions and continue their retirement, taking, the offensive laterj(3.) To break up the army and pass to guerilla warfare.. (d.) The object of the Greek Army must be to bring the Turks to battle and obtain a decisive decision as early as possible. If they cannot do this they may be faced with a long campaign of guerilla warfare, continuing into the winter, with a possibility of Russian troops arriving against them.   (See Appendix C.)
ADDENDUM.10. Narrative of main operations (continued from 3).    2nd  Phase;   from 29th July to 17th August.Between 29th July and 12th August both the Greek and Turk armies were e ngaged in reorganizing. On the 12th August the main Greek Army was concentrated between Alpi Keui and Ihsanie (27 miles south of Alpi Keui) in readiness for a further advance, which was to be made in accordance with a plan as detailed in Appendix D, to turn the Polatli Germesh Dagli from the south and then to occupy Angora. This plan is being put into operation, and the advance commenced in the morning of 14th August and reached the line Beylik Akhor Kaimaz that day. The disposition of the Greek and Turk forces on 12th August, together with the proposed lines of advance of the Greek Army, are shown on Map B attached, which also shows the extent of the Greek advance up to the loth August. A revised estimate of the Greek forces is given in Appendix E and of the Nationalist forces in Appendix F.On 17th August the Turkish III. and V. Groups were&apos; reported to be falling back on Polatli, the former astride of the Angora railway. The II. Group is now reported to be about 20 miles south of Poiatli.11. Russian intervention.In continuation of Appendix C it has been reported that on 20th July the Red Commander in Trans-Caucasia offered the help of the Army to the Nationalists on the grounds that the British were supporting the Greeks. The Turkish Grand National Assembly is reported to have thanked the Red Commander for his offer, but to have stated that, at present, Turkey does not feel herself to be in need of the assistance proffered, of which Turkey would avail herself should such aid become necessary. It is considered that unless they move at once, so as to reach Sivas before snow closes the passes, troops coming overland from the Caucasus will not be able to render effective assistance this year. ^12. Comments on the situation from reports received up to 17th August, 1921.It is reported that part of the Nationalist Government has already moved from Angora to Kaiseriya, and that the remainder is prepared to go there when necessary.Reports received to date indicate that the Nationalists intend to avoid a decisive battle, and will hold a series of rearguard positions with the intention of wearing down the Greeks. It appears that the Nationalists are prepared to give up a considerable extent of territory if necessary to carry out this plan.17th August, 1921.
APPENDIX A.PLAN OP GREEK OPERATIONS.   (1st PHASE.) (See Map A.)Brusa Front.1. Commencing&apos; on (G 3) day, the III Corps (Brusa) will advance in two groups. The first group under General Tricoupis will be composed of the 3rd and 11th Divisions (less 1 regiment). The function of this force will be to advance against the Avghin-Kovalija positions with the object of retaining as many Turkish divisions as possible in this area. Under cover of this, the second group of 7th and 10th Divisions will move south from Brusa, via, Adranos and should reach Harmanjik in time to advance from there on Kutaya on G. day simultaneously with the advance of the I and II Corps from Ushak.Ushak Front. &apos;2. On G. day the 2nd, 4th and 12th Divisions and Cavalry Brigade will commence to operate against Afium Karahissar. The 2nd Division and Cavalry Brigade will advance north-east in order to cut off the retreat to Kutaya. The Cavalry Brigade is charged with demolishing the railway at Kazli Geu! Hamman. The 12th Division will advance parallel and south of the railway on the Bal Mahmud position.The 4th Division will move parallel to the 12th Division .and to the south of it in order to cut off retreat towards Konia by an encircling move.After the capture of Afium (on G 4-1 day), the line there will be held by one regiment if the Turks have retired North, or by one division (the 4th) if the Turks have retired towards Konia ; the. rest of the force advancing on Kutaya by the Afium Kutaya road.3. The 9th Division (less four battalions holding the Meander and Chivril fronts) will make a demonstration against Kutaya along the Gediz road, commencing on G day.4. The remaining divisions (1st, 5th and 13th) will advance via, Altuntash against the Kutaya positions on G. day, being joined by the 2nd and 12tli after the capture of Afium (see para 2 above).APPENDIX B.ESTIMATE OF NATIONALIST  FORCES.1. From reports received to date it is believed that the following Turkish Nationalist formations have been engaged against the Greeks : Kodja Mi Group (Geive) :  . .33rd Cavalry Regiment and Irregulars. 5th (Kandra) Division. 61st Division.1 st Composite Division .1st Group :  ,1st Division.11th    ,, &apos;3rd Cavalry Division. 4th      ,, ,,14th    ,, Illrd Group : 4th Division . ,23rd    ,,5th (Caucasus) Division.15th      ,, ?Vth Group:-5th Division.7th Caucasus Division.3rd      ,, ,,Xllth Group:-7th Division. , .8th ,, 57th    ,,2nd Cavalry Division. 4th Group (composition uncertain):  ? 24th Division. ? 41st Division. Xth Group  1 6th Division (attached). -1 Composite Division. ? 1 Cavalry Division.? Irregulars. *This makes a total of 19 Divisions.5 Cavalry Divisions.
2. When operations started it was estimated that the Nationalist troops were distributed as follows:  (a.) On battle front 16 Divisions.3 Cavalry Divisions. (6.) In reserve West of Angora 8 Divisions.1 Cavalry Division.(c.) In addition it was considered that the following&apos; Divisions might be available later :-  From Cilicia     ..      ..      ....      .. 2 Divisions.From Amasia Area      ..       ..       ..       ..       .&apos;.   ? 3 Divisions.2 Cavalry Divisions.(d.) There is no confirmation of the move of any troops from Oilicia or Mesopotamia.   The two divisions included in (c) above may therefore be omitted.The total number of divisions available is therefore 22 Divisions.6 Cavalry Divisions. Paragraph 1 shows that the following have been engaged 19 Divisions.5 Cavalry Divisions.The Turks have, therefore, the following available, which have not yet been engaged  3 Divisions. 1 Cavalry Division.These are probably the Guards, 19th and Samsun Divisions, and the 6th Cavalry Division.3, The original estimate of the strength of the 22 Turkish Divisions and 6 Cavalry Divisions was 62,500 rifles and sabres, of which 56,000 have been engaged.Assuming that the Turks have retained 70 per cent, of the troops engaged they should have available 39,200 who took part in the fighting. 6,500 reserves not engaged. ;. 9,000 reinforcements which were available at Angora.Total   ..    54,700 rifles and sabres.4. From reports on the Greek Army before the operations it is understood that the Greeks have sufficient men available to bring their army up to its original strength, viz.. 51,500.APPENDIX C.COMMENT ON THE POSSIBILITY OF RUSSIAN TKOOPS HELPING THE NATIONALISTS. 1. Troops available.The Russian troops near the Eastern Turkish frontier are distributed as follows: Kutais      ..       ..       ..       ..   33rd Division.Batum      ..       .. ..    12th Cavalry Division.Gori..        ..       ..       ..       ..    18th Division.Ardahan     ..     &apos;..       ..       ..   31st Division.Tiflis ..     ,..       ..       ..   9th Division.1st Cavalry Division.Headquarters, XIth Army (Gekker). Erivan Area        ..       ..       ..    28th Division.. 20th Division. Kavaklis    ..       .. ..    18th Cavalry Division.Nakhichevan Area ..       ..       ,.   42nd Division.The total number of Russian troops in the Caucasus is 129,400 rifles and sabres.Note. The strength of a Russian Division is about 5,500 rifles and sabres, and of a Cavalry Division, 2,000 sabres.2. According tothe report of a speech made by Ferzi Pasha (Nationalist&apos; Minister of Defence) on the the 27th June, the Russian Force contemplated fur use with the Turks was: Two Infantry Divisions.One Cavalry Division.Several Battalions of Storm Troops.Aircraft.Automobiles.3. The location of the Infantry and Cavalry Divisions. which might be made available is given in paragraph 1.Iu addition there is a possibility of troops being brought by sea from Russia itself.As regards the &quot; Several battalions of Storm troops,&quot; these would probably be raised locally, or special Communist detachments might be sent from the interior. Troops from the IIIrd &quot; International&quot; Army might also be employed for this purpose.The aircraft might be made available from units in the Crimea, Odessa or the Caucasus. In this area there are about 40 serviceable machines and a number under repair. It is considered that some of the latter might be patched up.   The maximum number wliich the Russians could spare is about 15.The automobiles might come from detachments of armoured cars, lorries and cars in Trans-Caucasia. It is not considered that the Russians would be able to spare many.
4. Routes by which Russian Troops could be sent to Anatolia.(a.) By sea from Russia or the Caucasus to a port on the North Coast of Anatolia. The ports available are (i.) Trebizond.(ii.) Kerasimd. (iii.) Samsun. (iv.) Sinope.(v.) Ineboli.These ports have been used by the Turks and Russians for some time.It is for consideration whether the Greeks will be able to prevent the Russians from using all or any of these ports. They should certainly be able to prevent the Russians from going to Ineboli, and the Admiralty consider that thev should also be able to prevent Russian troops being landed in any numbers at any of these ports, though they could not prevent au occasional ship reaching one of them. If this is so,&apos; the dangers attending the move of troops to one of these ports would not make it worth while for the Russians to attempt it.Trebizond is the place where the Russians are most likely to land troops. There is deep water close in shore, and ships carrying 1,000 troops could go alongside the breakwater east of the town.All the guns of the old defences have been rendered unserviceable. Efforts have been made to improve the trenches, and mountings have been prepared for two Russian 10-inch guns.Routes from Trebizond to the Angora front are (i.) Via Erzingau to the main Kars-Angora road.The distance from Trebizond to Angora by this route is 617 miles.    The road is good, so it might be assumed that troops going this way would take not less than 41 days&apos; marching and 6 days&apos; halt say 47 days, (ii.) via Shabin Kara-Hissar: the distance is shorter, being 565 miles, which would take not less than / 38 days&apos; marching and 5 days&apos; halt say 43 days.    This route leaves route (i.) above at Keusseand joins it again at Yusaf Bey Chiflluk, 10 miles east of Enderes.(5.) Overland from the Caucasus.An estimate of the time required to move troops by overland routes from the Caucasus to Anatolia is given below: From.	To.	Route.	Miles.

(See also Appendices E. and F. attached.)(1.) Ill A.C. (a.) 11th Div., less 1 Regt., is to mask the Turkish Koja I Hi Group in the vicinity of Keupri Hissar. .:.(b.) 3rd Div., plus 16th Regt. (11th Div.), and 1 group Field Arty. (12 guns) is to attack Mnhalich aud proceed thence via Bey bazar road towards Angora in order to make good this line of communication.(c.) Another Division1 of the III A.C. (? 7th) plus 1 Group Heavy Artillery (12 120-mm. guns) is to entrench and hold the line Karahan Koltan Dinek (15 miles N.E. to 7 miles s.w. of Sivri Hisear).(d.)
