Sir,The earlier part of your lottor is sc muoh opposed to our fundamental position that we feel hound to leave you in no doubt of our meaning.   You state that after eonsalting your colleagues you confirm, your aeelar&amp;ticn that cur proposal are such as Dail Bireann could not, and the Irish people would not, accept.     You add that the outline given in our draft is self-contradictory, and the principle of the pact offered to you not easy to determine.     We desire, therefore, to make cur position absolutely clear.In our opinion, nothing is to he gained by prolonging a theoretical discussion of the national status which you may he willing- to accept as compared with that of the great self-governing Dominions of the British Commonwealth, &quot;but we must direct your attention to one point upon which you lay some emphasis and upon which no British Government can compromise -namely, the claim that we should acknowledge the right of Ireland to secede from her allegiance to the King.   No such right can ever he acknowledged by us.     The geographical pro-pinquity of Ireland to the British Isles is a fundamental factSBCRET.0*P*i3E14&apos;*A.
The history of the two islands for many centuries, however it is road, is sufficient proof thrt their destinies are indis-soluhly linked. Ireland haB sent members to the British Parliament for more than a hundred years.   Many thousands of her people during all that time have enlisted freely and serve a gallantly in tfcTo Forces of the Crown.   Great numbers, in all the Irish provinces, aro profoundly attaohed to the Throno.      Theso facts permit of one answer, and one only,to the claim that Britain should negotiate with Ireland as a separate and foreign power.Vtoon you, as the chosen representative   of Irish national ideals, came&apos; to speak with me, I made ono condition only, of which our proposals plainly stated tho effect - that Ireland should recognise the fores of geographical and historical facts.     It is those facts which govern tho problem of British and Irish relations*   If they did not exist, there would be no problem to gjecupScI pass therefore to the conditions which aro imposed by these facts.   V,re set them out clearly In six clauses in our former proposals, snd need not restate them here, except to say that the British Government cannot consent to the reference of any such questions which concern Great Britain and Ireland alone, to the arbitration of a foreign Power,Wo aro profoundly glad to have your agreement that Her thorn Ireland oannot be coerced,   This point Ir,it great importance,&apos; because tho resolve of our people to resist with their full powor any attempt at secession by ono part of Ireland carries with it of necessity an equal rcsolvo to resist any effort to coorce another part of Ireland to abandon its allogianco to the Crown..   7o gladly give you tho assurarico th t we will concur in any settlement which
liitohall Gardens, S August 2Bth,. 1.981.Southern and northern Iivland may mak.i for Irish unity within the six conditions already laid down,, which apply to Southern and Morthorn Ireland alilro ;   hut wo o an not agree to refer the question of your relations with herthorn Ireland to foreign arbitration.The conditions of tho propose settlement do not arts a. from any desire to force our will upon peopla- of another raco, but from facts which are as vital to IrslancPs welfare as to our own.   They contain no derogation from Ireland&apos;s Status as a Dominion, no desire for British ascendancy over Ireland, and no impairment of Ireland&apos;s national ideals..Our proposals present to the Irish people an opportunity such as has never dawned in their history before.. - s have made thorn in tho sincere tfesiro to aohiovo issues;. but beyond them we cannot go.    ?a trust that y:,u will bo able to accept thorn in principle.   I shall be ready to discuss their application in detail whenever your acceptance in prinoipla is communicated to me.,I am,, Yours faithfully,,(Sgd) .,   D.. EIOYD GraGRGS..Eamon de Valor a,. Ssq..,.
