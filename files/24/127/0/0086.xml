AMINl.(Reference Paper No1 CP.3245 (Clause B) Cabinet 67 (31) ^nolusipn^&apos;? &quot; &quot;    and   &apos; &quot;&quot;&quot;   &quot;C&quot;a&apos;binet&quot;*69 (SI) Conol.il(l)    The Commission held its first meeting oh the 30th August.The personnel of the delegations of the countries representedare set out in Appendix A to this report.    The Araerioan delegate,Mr. Lyman Brown stated that he was in the position of holding awatching brief.    The Commission appointed. Monsieur NoulonsPresident of the Conference.(2)    The British Delegation arrived in Paris on the 28th August. This enabled them to devote tho following day to discussions with the Prenoh Foreign Office and with such members of other delega-tions as they were able to meet.    This w&amp;a fortunate, as no programme had been arranged and as a result of those informal conversations, a definite plan was agreed upon and considerable delay avoided.(3)    The resolutions which are fully set out in Appendix.B to this report were passed by the Commission.    The resolutions dealing with the despatch of the Mission ef Enquiry to Russia end the activities of charitable organisations formed the subject of detailed investigation and report by two sub-committees.The telegram set out in Appendix B was despatchod by Monsieur Houlens to Monsieur Chicherin on the evening of the 1st september.There was complete unanimity on all the resolutions adopted.(4)    The Commission considered what aotion should    be tahea according as the reply of the Soviet Covernment tooh the form either (a) acoeptance of the proposal/co to/
to sand a Mission,  (b)    refusal,  (o) was of a dilatory character..   They decided that in tbe event: of acceptance, tbe Mission should be despatched forthwith.    In the ev:ent of a refusal,  it was felt tbet as tho Commission considered the report of tbe Mission of Bingulr-y an essential condition precedent to making any recommendations (other than those contained in the resolutions of the present session) j no useful purpose would be served by the various Balegations reassembling,       and that Monsieur Houlons should be given authority tc publish the roply of the Soviet Government and to make a statement on the position in accordance with the views expressed by the delegations in agreeing to the necessity for the Mission.       In the event of the Soviet Government sending a roply of a dilatory character,  it was felt that this might either involve explanations merely on points of detail or might raise questions cf principle. &apos; It was,  therefore, .decided that each delegation should appoint one of their number to serve on a sub-committee, which could be summoned by Monsieur Nonlens at short notice to assist him in framing his reply.   Mr.Eardrop, who can come quickly at&apos; short notice from Strasbourg to .:&apos;aris,- will represent the British delegation on this cab-committee. -It is proposed that the British members cf tho Mission of Enquiry should consist of the following :--Sir John Campbell       -       Famine General Hence and colonel Hull -       Transportx     Mr. MacBougal -      AgricultureMr.Vise -       Administrationtogether with Mr.Preston as Interpreter./It.x made the report on Agriculture in Germany for&apos; the Supreme Economic Council in 1919.   &quot;
It was stated at the Commission that other Nations.wonlo^hapm^o-difficulty in appointing doctors, and it is, therefore, felt that in view of Colonel Hull&apos;s knowledge and experience of the railways in Southern Russia   and of the importance of tho transport problem, it is desirable that he should he associated with General Manoe.It is understood that all these gentlemen are prepared to serve oh the Mission;   ana they have already been advised&quot; to hole! themselves in reaaihoss. (6)   Credits. The British Delegation opened a discussion on credits and submitted a proposal which is set out in Appendix c.   This proposal deals with the question purely from the economic point of view and follows the lines of the Prime Ministers speech of the 16th August.   The terms of this draft reso-lution wer*e agreed between Mons. Xoucheur and Sir Philip lloyd-Greame;   and they were also approved in principle by the Japanese and Belgians prior to the formal disousslon.At the discussion on the Commission the Italian Delegates stated that they were not authorised by their government or prepared to discuss the question of the recognition of debts at this stage.   It was pointed out that any recommendation as to credits involved by implication a reoomnendation tacit or expressed on the subject of debts.    This reasoning was admitted;   hut no decision was reached for the following reasons(a) Some delegates doubted if a recommendation as to credits was within the scope of the Commission.(b) The feeling was expressed in some quarters that this subject involved a great politicalquestion end ought to be dealt with by the   -Supreme Counoil.*   - / f&quot;)
(c) Other delegates again felt a difficulty in making any recommendation without further reference to their Governments;(d) It was suggested that any decision on the question of credits ought to be pcst-poned until the mission of enquiry had reported.In these cixcumstanoes, while it was impossible to secure a unanimous decision, there was little doubt that the French, Belgian and Japanese Delegations agreed with the British proposal.    The Italians were doubtful.    In this connection it may be remembered that the Italians have only a small interest in Russian debts and claims.    Accordingly, as it was impossible to arrive at a decision, the British Delegation agreed to the desire of the other delegations that the question should be adjourned.Mr. Lodge arrived in Baris on the 1st September and communicated to the British Delegation Dr, llansen&apos;s agreement with the Soviet Government and his proposals for credits.    This information was at once placed before the Commission by the British Delegation.As stated above, the Commission failed to arrive at any decision on the question of credits; but it was clear that there was the strongest opposition in all quarters to Dr. Han senT s proposals for credits,   liven the Italian Delegation regarded the provision of full security as essential to any credit proposal.During the meetings of the Commission the news arrived that the non-Bolshevic members of the All-Russian Committee had been arrested.    There was some disposition,expressed for the most part outside the Conference Room, that this precluded further discussion.    The British Delegation opposed this view, which was not pressed
\. 476pressed; but it&quot; was&quot; generally-^agreed- that, this action rendered the despatch of a mission of enquiry &quot;more than ever necessary asi the condition precedent of any detailed recommendations by the Commission to their respective Governments.(9) The proceedings of the Commission were marked bya signal degree of unanimity.   All the delegates clearly approached the question as an economic and humanitarian problem, and without any political considerations; and the Interchange of views between the various delegations both formally an informally was throughout full and frank.(10) A Prooes-Verbal of the proceedings cf theCommission Is being prepared by the French Secretariat and will be  osroaraed from Paris in the course of a few -days.(Sgd,, ) P.

The following Resolutions were paes ed&apos; &quot;by the International Commission- on.-Sept-exuber ist.Mission bf Enquiry.It was resolved that. a Mission of Enquiry should be sent to Russia to examine the famine conditions on the spot.   The constitution of the Mission and scope of the enquiry together with the text cf the telegram despatched to Monsieur Chicherin are as follows:-(i) Constitution.   Each Delegation will nominate at most five&apos; persons and one interpreter..The experts will be specialists in the following subjects:-1. Famine relief 2. Transport -   3* Medical and Sanitary questions 4. Agriculture 5. -Administration.The interpreters must know Russian and as faras possible two other European languages.There will further.be included in the Mission ofEnquiry a member nominated by the Mixed Commissionof the International Committee of the Red Cross and ofthe League of the Red Crosses.(ii) Telegram to the. Soviet Government..,     &quot;The Mission nominated by the Supreme Council to make, proposals on the best &apos;way of helping the Russian,people suffering from famine and epidemics, has unanimously decided, with the sole object of organisin-r effective assistance, that it is essential in order to fulfil its task to send to Russia a Committee of experts to conduct on the spot/
spot a rapid, and thorough enquiry into the question of what is necessary and the resources available as quickly and as thoroughly as possible.&quot;Consequently the Commission has decided.to address itself to the Soviet Government to obtain for the Mission of Enquiry - of which the composition and the scope of the investigations to be carried out are set forth below - the necessary facilities in order to proceed, with its enquiries with the object of presenting a report as quickly as possible.&quot;The information in the possession of the Committee lead-s it to suppose that the experts would, conduct their enquiry most quickly if they travelled first to Movorossisk and from there to Moscow across the famine area.&quot;The Commission cannot doubt that its proposal will meet with the approval of the Soviet Government, The experts will be ready to start for Russia as soon as the Soviet Government gives its consent to the proposal and gives an assurance that the. experts will meet with the necessary facilities in order to proceed with their enquiry.&quot;The Mission of Enquiry will be composed of some thirty individuals belonging to the nationalities of the five powers represented on the International Commission and will be chosen for special knowledge on questions of fanine, transport,  sanitation, agri-culture and administration.    There will also be attached to them a representative of the Red Cross and interpreters,.&quot;The/
&quot;The scope of the enquiry-is given in the f o 1 lo w 1 ng mom oranduau -lo   Area and extent of the famine and number ofpersons affected, 2*   present importance and possible developments ox &quot;the emigration of the population threatened by the famine 0 3C   Extent and possible developments of epidemic diseasesa4.    In what measure sowing can be effected this year and next year in the famine area..5o    Impoxtanqe and destination of the reserves of food and the stirplus of or troops which could be need in tho famine areaP     Also the losses and available number of live-stook.6o    State of transport in general and particularly between the provinces disposing of a surplus and the territories sttbjected to famine as well as the state of the ports.7.   Measures taken by the Soviet Government to deal with the above problems.    Existing organisations or those to be created for the following objects:-a. Collection of grain in the provinces with a surplus.-b. Distribution of food and seed con. in the districts subjected to the famine.c. Treatment of sick persons svrffering from epidemics or from lack of sufficient food. Preventive methods against epidemics.d. Special care for children.e*.     Agricultural work in the famine area.-.f.     Distribution of food stuffs and ob jecti, of primary necessity in the interior and exchange against products.
ge     Measures to be undortakon to make the organisation of relief more offectivo, ospocially as concerns those products and instruments the importation of which by the soviet Governmont is particularly necessary.    Designation of the areas where they must be distributed. -h0     Examination of the possibilities ofestablishing special territorial a ones to be supplied with food from abroad. The above instructions which are givon to the Mission of Enquiry cannot be carried out unless the Soviet Government gives the Members of the Mission all facilities for moving fredly in the districts which they will have to visit and unless the local authorities aro invited to provide all usoful information and give the assistance necessary that the enquiry may obtain      useful results.&quot;(iii)     The Commission trust that within seven days expert-will bo chosen and that their departure will take place on September 15th at the latest.It was resolved that the Mission of Enquiry shou3.d make a report within three weeks of their arrival in Russia,League of Nations and Prevention of Epidemics-      The Conference is convinced of the necessity of preventing diseases from gaining ground in tho states bordering on Russia^ This cannot but be a soriousproblem not only in Europe but also in tho Caucasus.The /
, The Commission is of the opinion, that the Organisation under the League of&apos; Nations, which hes. already under-taken this work, is particularly qualified to continue it.     The Commlseibn, therefore, expresses the hope that the League ef Nations will eontlnue its task,In order to avoid overlapping and to benefit by mutual experience, it would he desirable if the organ!-sation of the League of Nations remained In close ooutaot with the Mixed Commission of the Red Cress and all other bodies engaged in sanitary work In Russia.The Conference oonsiders that the activity of the Organisation under the League of Nations will be most usefully confined to the States bordering upon Russia. When it will consider that any action be usefully under-taken in Russia, the Organisation will ask constituted bodies working in Russia to proceed there.. Co-ordination of Charitable Relief.The Commission whloh has taken note of the Resolutions adopted at the Assembly called together by the Mixed International Commission of the Red Cross at Geneva on the 15th and 16th August, associates itself with the appeal addressed to the public for the collection of charitable funds for Russia,     It Insists that the delegates of each country should do everything in their power to encourage the different charitable organisations in their respective oountries to unite their funds and their products whloh are neoessary for the Russian population affected by the famine.Without pre-judging the plan of action, the direct organisation of whloh it will be able to recommend xo Governments, the Commission recommends to the Red-n /Crosses
Crosses to take measures to   act as quickly as possible.It draws the attention of the governments to the opportunity of each assisting its national Red Cross, especially by furnishing to it all the surplus medical and sanitary material available in order to co-operate In the work of helping Russia.The Commission has   heard with satisfaction the news given by.the representative of the American Relief Administration, namely, that while reserving its liberty of action, the organisation could work in complete accord with Its other organisations as to the best means of avoiding overlapping.     While recognising that the private charitable organisations which are already bringing help to Russia must continue to provide their help by the ways hitherto adopted, the Commission considers it essential in order to obtain the best result from the activities and resources employed in order to alleviate the famine in Russia, that the organisations of all the countries represented should take account cf the directions which the Commission will be in a position to give when it is in possession of the report of its Mission of Enquiry.The Commission considers it advisable to invite the Mixed Commission of the Red Cross in Geneva to send a representa-tlve to take his place among its members.Credits.    The Commission considered the question of credits.Doubt was expressed by some of the delegations as to the competence of some of the members to deal.with the question.      The Commissionaccordingly agreed to adjourn the discussion and to take theInstructions of their respective Governments.Re pre s en t a t i on of ^othgr^na tions on the Comm. iss i on.It was resolved that,  as soon as the Mission of Enquiry has reported, the Commission will invite to join it representatives of all nations, which are able and w illing to render assistance to the Russian famine.
Appendix Q. CREDITS.The Conference feels a difficulty in making speolfio suggestions in the abeonoe of the necessary information whioh the Mission of Enquiry is designed to obtain.       I But in view of the faot that roguests hava been mado by the Soviet Government for credits in ono form or another, tho Conferenoe oonsiders it at once within its province and within its competence to record the following conclusions :(1)   Whatever the precise dimensions of the present famine no adequate or final solution can   be fcmdj unless conditions are established in which the internal distribution and exchange of grain and commodities in Kuscia can take-plaoe effectively, and unless a degree of confidence is established which will induce foreign exporters to send their goods into Russia.(2)    Credit must rest on confidence:    and no confidence can be created or maintained among the trading communities of the world unless debts and obligations are recognised) and advances are sufficiently secured.   Nor is there any difference in tho principle upon which credits can be given by Governments from those upon which oredit is given and obtained by private traders.In those oiroumstancGB the Conference is forced to the conclusion that tho effective creation of credits for assisting exports to Russia will only bo practicable under two conditions:(&amp;)    That tho Russian Government should recognise its responsibility for the discharge of existing debts and other Obligations and liabilities;(b)    That adequate security should be afforded for any credit given in future.(3)    If credits are given on thoso conditions they should bo devoted to assisting the import into
Russia of such-commodities as the Conference considers most essential, after talcing-into consideration, the report of the Mission of Enquiry.(4)   The Conference desires to emphasise as strongly as possible the fact that in coming to those conclusions, they are actuated by no political motive.    But they feel bound to express their conviction, based solely on economic considerations that tho conditions herein stated are vital if either public or privato credit is to be extended to Russia with any hope of effectively alleviating the existing distress and preventing a recurrence of the present disaster.Whitehall Gardens, S.vV.1. 6th September, 1921.
