September 1921.SECRET.O.P.-3291.cabinet.WEEKLY SURVEY  OF  THE  STATE  OF  IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 29th August.General State of the Country.Observance of Truce.With the exception of Belfast, the country remains &quot;in a &quot;peaceful and undisturbed condition. The breaches of the truce alleged on either side : The Sinn Feiners are unquestionably using the truce period for drilling, recruiting,/target -practice, and war training generally. The illegal collection of money: and dpening of Sinn Fein courts continue. A very serious breach, however, was committed5By Sinn Fein on the 23rd instant in the kidnapping of two Constables of the Royal Irish Constabulary near Bandon (co. Cork). The events leading up to this outrage were the seizure by the Police of a car commandeered by the I.R.A. before the truce, the counter-seizure as a reprisal by three or four members of the I.R.A. of a car belonging to the local District Inspector of Police the intention being to hold this car-until1 the commandeered car was returned -and the arrest by the Police of one of the persons concerned in the counter-seizure. The demand of the Irish Government for the immediate return of the District Inspector^ car was met by the Sinn Fein Liaison Officer with the -plea that the interference by the Police with the commandeered car was also a breach of the truce, and with the further claim, that, in view of this alleged act of provocation, the member of the L.R.A. arrested for complicity in the attack on the District Inspector^ car should be released without trial. To this demand the &apos; Commander-in-chief was unable to accede, and - the prisoner has since been tried and convicted by court martial on the charge of being in possession of arms and dum-dum ammunition. The return of the District Inspectors car and the unconditional release of the two kidnapped Constables will, of course, be insisted upon. The other breaches of the truce mentioned in the Police reports of the week were 11 illegal arrests of civilians, 3 cases of burning of hay, and 1 case of cattle-stealing. Suspicion that the burnings were committed by the. I.R.A. is based upon the fact that the owners of the hay are believed to have refused to subscribe to Sinn Fein funds, but it is possible that these crimes were really agrarian and non-political in character. The case of cattle-stealing is also one of suspicion, grounded on the fact that a body of Sinn Fein Volunteers are encamped in the vicinity of the place where the theft was committed. The illegal krrests are believed to have been made for the purpose of conducting trials by Sinn Fein courts.Disturbances in Belfast.A further outbreak of party disturbances took place in Belfast on the 29th instant and resulted in the death of 2 and the&apos; serious wounding of.&apos;8&apos;persons. The whole of these casualties appear to have been caused by sniping,, the victims being 1 Catholic killed and 5 wounded, and 1 Protestant killed and 3 wounded. As the result of joint action&apos;by the Police and Military order was restored late in the afternoon, but sniping again broke out on the morning of the 30th and continued throughout the day. According to the latest Police report, the casualties since the commencement of the outbreak on the 29th instant now.. nuniber 8 killed and 49 wounded. Thearea principally affected is the &quot; mixed&quot; locality of and around York Street and North Queen Street, in which the rioting of the 22nd instant took place.-[6911]
Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.Seven trials of civilians by court-martial were concluded during the week. The following is a summary of the sentences imposed in the five cases in which convictions were obtained : 2 sentences of penal servitude (3 years and 15 years).1 sentence of imprisonment with hard labour (18 months).1 sentence of imprisonment without hard labour (3 months).1 sentence remitted.Total     5The sentence of 15 years&apos; penal servitude was imposed for the offence of participating in an attack upon a Police Constable, and the sentence of 3 years&apos; penal servitude for the&apos; offence of attempting to induce a soldier of His Majesty&apos;s Army to join the Irish Volunteers. The sentence of 18 months&apos; hard labour was-for an attempted illegal sale of firearms, and the sentence of 3 months&apos; imprisonment without hard labour was for manslaughter, the accused in this case being a Constable of the Royal Irish Constabulary. To the above civilian cases should be added the conviction and sentence to 18 months&apos; imprisonment with hard labour of a soldier for an attempt to sell arms to a civilian. The two cases of acquittal were on charges of robbery and attempted murder.Internment Orders.The following statement shows the position as regards internments up to the 27th instant: Total orders made ... ... ... ...      4,245Orders cancelled for reasons other tl\an release 155Releases ordered ... ... ... ....      421-        576Number of persons now interned    ... ...       3,669The number of appeals awaiting hearing is 23.State of the Police Forces.

Fortunately, however, the dispute was brought to a satisfactory termination on the following day by the company&apos;s voluntary withdrawal of their proposed new conditions as to hours of service pending the adjudication of the Arbitration Tribunal, and all sections of the men have now resumed work. The surprising readiness of the Irish railwaymen to refer the whole of their case in regard to reduction of wages and extension of hours to the decision of a joint Arbitration Tribunal would appear to be attributable in a great measure to their desire not to embarrass the political leaders of Sinn Fein by precipitating a grave industrial crisis at a critical stage of the peace negotiations. This explanation of the men&apos;s action was put forward by Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P., in a speech delivered before the Arbitration Tribunal on the 29th instant, and throws light upon the strong desire which is known to be felt throughout the ranks of Irish labour for a political settlement.The disappointment expressed by the Prime Minister in his reply to Mr. de Valera&apos;s letter of the 24th instant was undoubtedly shared by many people in Ireland when the inconclusive nature of the Sinn Fein leader&apos;s latest communication became known. There is a growing opinion that the time has now come for the substitution of personal negotiations for an exchange of notes, and it is generally felt that verbal differences as to fundamental principles will be seen in their true proportions when the practical side of the problem is once taken in hand. The following extract from a leading article which appeared in the &quot; Irish Independent &quot; on the morning of the publication of the correspondence between the Prime Minister and Mr. de Valera well expresses this view, and derives additional significance from the fact of this paper&apos;s close association with Sinn Fein policy during the past two years : &quot; The Irish people do not desire a resumption of hostilities. With the will for peace and with the exercise of diplomacy and restraint on both sides it ought to be possible at this stage by conference between the Irish plenipotentiaries and the British. Government to arrive at a basis upon which a settlement honourable and satisfactory to both nations can be effected. In oitr opinion, more fruitful work can be accomplished at this stage by means of a conference than by correspondence. Ireland expects that its leaders will secure the best terms they can extract from the British Government, but Ireland does not want war.&quot;Present Political Situation in Ireland.H.
