IS DOCUMENT&apos; IS TEE - PROPERTY&apos;--OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT ) .O0IDENT1AL,CAB I N S T..p* 3281. :UNESfiPLOYMBNT^AND. THE. RATES,Copy of letter from the Secretary, London Labour Party to the&quot;&quot;Prime Minister...&quot;*&quot;The London Labour Party, Bedford   Row House,58, Theobalds Road, W.C. 1..1st September, 1921*The Rt, Hon. D. Lloyd George,..O.m0 , M.P., 10, Downing Street,Whitehall, S.W. 1.Sir,I am directed by the Executive Committee of the London Labour Partyto remind you of previous correspondence with regard to the question of unemployment in the Metropolis.Throughout last Autumn, winter and spring the whold Trade Union and Labour Movement was impressing the Government with the need for taking constructive and statesmanlike action to deal with the grave situation existing, and likely to exist for some, time to come.   My Executive regrets to express the opinion that the Government has not faced the fundamentals of the problem and that it is guilty of grave neglect of its duties towards large masses of.the population.We are noYf in the summer months and yet unemployment in London is enormous in its magnitude.    In the absence of adequate action by the Government the outlook for the coming winter is blaok and tragic in the extreme, and I am desired to express to you the very deepfelt conviction of the London Labour   Party Executive that a special session of Parliament should be called immediately in order that legislation may be passed and adminis-trative action taken on the lizies demanded in the Report of the Trade Union Congress and Labour Party on Unemployment published in January of this year.You will have seen from the press that very strong pres-sure is being brought to bear by the unemployed on the local Poor Law Authorities in London for the purpose of securing adequate relief, and I am desired to draw your attention to the serious consequences to the ratepayers, of whom the working classes from such a substantial percentage, particu-larly in the poorer districts of London.We/
We have been hoping for steady reductions in the rates, but one of the consequences of the neglect of unemployment by joxlx Government appears likely to be the substantial increase In local rates.    In view of the system of municipal finance obtaining In the Metropolis the rates will be highest whore unemployment and poverty is moat intense, and a substantial proportion of the cost of relieving the unemployed in these poor boroughs will have to be met by the unemployed themselves, and by workpeople in employ-ment who can ill afford such extra burdens in these times of falling wages.The London labour Party Meeutive ventures respeotfully, but with the greatest possible flijmness, to submit that unemployment i essentially a national problem^ and that the Government is guilty of atrocious injustice when it(Stands aside and allows such a larga proportion of the financial burden consequent upon a national social problem to fall upon the backs of the local rate-payers.     &apos; &apos;I am desired by my Executive to ask either:-(1) That Parliament shall immediately meet and take prompt and adequate measures to deal with the terrible situation consequent on unemployment; or.  (2) That if the Government should prefer the matter to be dealt with by the Poor Law Authorities it should provide the finances necessary for this purpose in order that the burden shall not fall upon the local ratepayers.I am to add that in the opinion of my Executive the present method, er lack of method, in dealing with the problem is waste-ful in the extreme.   Large sums of money are being disbursed by the Government and the local Poor Law Authorities without any useful economic return in necessary and useful labour, and as Labour desires the greatest possible elimination of waste, we submit that in the absence of better proposals by the Government Parliament should put into operation the constructive programme of the Trade Union Congress and the labour Party which, in a short time, would secure that the expenditure involved would be useful and productive expenditure In the public interest.The present situation in London is one of extreme gravity and in the absence of immediate and suitable action by the Government there is every indication of it becoming much worse. Continued nagleot of the problem may produce consequences to social order and Local Government administration of a very un-desirable character for which the lack of policy on the part of your administration will be held entirely responsible.We shall be glad to hear the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government an this matter.Yours faithfully,(Sgd.) Herbert Morrison. .Secretary.?white hall Gardens, 8.9.1. September 5th, 1921.
