(Previous reference - Paper No. CP. 5282).VISCOUNT ISHII (President) said, &quot;My colleagues have now had time to examine the documents presented to them.     I hope that to-day we shall be able to reach a unanimous conclusion on the procedure to be adopted.I am sure that my colleagues understand that when I under-took the task of Rapporteur at our first-meeting I had no desire to continue in that capacity.    What I wanted to do was to pre-seht to you a report giving an impartial statement of the facts of the question and I hope that I have succeeded.This task has now been oompleted and we have arrived at the second stage of our work.     As I have Just said, I do not wish to continue as Rapporteur.     Affcer deep reflection on the question of procedure, I have decided to read to you the follow-ing draft resolution which I have prepared:-With a view to enabling the Council to arrive In complete independence at an opinion on the question which has been sub-mitted to it, its members are unanimous in thinking it desirable-1-^7n3(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT). SECRET. CP. 3287.-- CABINET.LEAGUE   of   NATIONS. tJPPER SILESIA.Provisional Minutes of the Second Extraordinary Meeting of the Council to consider the question of Upper Silesia. Held on Thursday September 1st, 1921 at 4 p*m.All the Representatives of the Members of the Council were present and the Secretary-General.
to entrust the preliminary examination of the question to the representatives of Belgium, Brazil, China and Spain, States which have so far taken no part in the preliminary investigations, nor in the discussions to which these investigations have given rise.It will be the duty of the representatives of these Powers to study the various aspects of the problem, with the help of the documents forwarded by the Supreme Council and of any other means of information.They will have the right to seek such information as they may think useful; and to obtain such expert advice as may be necessary.     It is desirable that the experts who will be appointed should have takeh ho part in the investigations and discussions, and that they should be chosen, as far as possible, from among such persons as have already collaborated in the work of the Technical Organisations of the League.     With a view to supplying local information which may be of use, Inhabitants (both German and Polish) of the territory of Upper Silesia may be heard.The services of the Secretariat will be at their disposal for all assistance that may be required.They will carry on their work in complete freedom, and without any procedure being eatabliehed.     The^ will report to the Council, who will continue to keep in touch with the matter, and who will, at any moment, be able to meet so as to examine the results of the investigations which are taking place.&quot;MR. balfour said:    &quot;We have been given a very difficult and an all-important task by the Supreme Council, and I am bound to
express my own opinion^, Tihleh-JLa^Hhat&apos; th^-Tnethodjproposed .by our President, which, he has Just read out, for dealing with the problem entrusted to us, is probably much the best that oould be adopted.     I think it deserves to give, and I think It will give, to the public oi all countries, who are watching this subject with the keenest interest, the impression that the Council has determined not merely to make an independent examination of the question entrusted to them but to do so under conditions which will remove any euspioion that this is being dealt with from the point of view of any one country rather than another, and that we are going to continue the contro-verey which has - naturally, perhaps, but most unfortunately -arisen in connection with this problem of Upper Silesia.     It will show that the Council of the League of Nations is going to approach this question in the spirit which, I hope, the Council of the League of Nations will always show:   that is to say, a complete detaohment from the narrow and Individual views and a deliberate and determined Intention to deal impartially and in the broadest spirit with all the questions that are brought before us.     Nothing, indeed, can create that spirit if we have not got it, but I think we have got it. All that Is required is to find the machinery which will enable those good intentions to be effectually carried through   and, as far as my Judgment ia worth anything, the machinery proposed by our President on the present sscasion ia admirably adapted for that purpose for which It Is intended.&quot;

M.. Leon BOURGEOIS said, &quot;I an in entire.agreement,. -Gentlemen, with the declaration which Mr. Balfour has just made, and I desire to state that I have quite decided to vote for the adoption of the method of work submitted to you by Viscount Ishii, without any change being made in it,I agree with Mr. Balfour when he said that thanks to this method, universal public opinion will realise that the wish of the Council is to examine this problem submitted to it, which is one of such great difficulty, in a spirit of entire independence and of entire impartiality.That independence and that impartiality are guaranteed by the fact that four of our colleaguesj whoee countries have taken no part in the previous discussion on this question, are going to undertake its preliminary study..   As the terms of Viscount Ishiifs proposal show, the other members of the Council will certainly not relinquish interest in the progress of this affair for a moment. They have every confidence that their colleagues will make all the preliminary investigations and they will keep in close touch with them, in order to keep fully informed of the state of the work and Of how far it is advanced.As I have said, public opinion, will not be deceived.   It will realise that our method will be entirely impartial and comparable to that followed in Law Cotirts, where entirely independent judges strive to realise the same standard in their method of procedure.Thus, we shall respond, both to the desire of that public opinion which wishes to see brought to an end the difficulties which are troubling the public mind and which may endanger the peace of the world, and also to the will of the Allied and Associated-Governments as well as to that of the Supreme Council which has handed over this question to us.
i-    503The--Supreme^ounoiJ___in;J*aking rthis&apos; act ion -certainly intended&quot;to-enrtrust- to impartial judges the independent and impartial study of the question.    We will respond to this appeal.It is,- therefore, with very great confidence that we can,  I think, adopt the procedure proposed to us,: and. we should, thank our President, Viscount Ishii,. for having so well defined it in.the text submitted for.our consideration.&quot;The Marquis IMPERIALI said:    &quot;I entirely agree with the remarks of my colleagues, the representatives of Great Britain and of Prance, and I adhere fully.to the draft resolution pro-posed by-the President.I-..Should^ like to add-, one. word, of the warmest - thanks . to . our distinguished, colleagues who are ready.to aid and to collaborate so. courageously in a work-the success of which may have con-sequences.of extreme.importance for the/future of the League of Nations,:to which we are so strongly attached.&quot;Viscount;ISHII Paid:    &quot;If no-one else desires to speak,I ask the representatives of the four Members, of the;League, Belgium^ Brazil, China and Spain - to be -good enough to accept, in accordance with the proposal which;I have;just made, the - task of proceeding to a preliminary study and to present to us a:report on the question of Upper Silesia.-&quot;m. da. CUNHA:   ;I-tarn-in entire agreement with ,this proposal -if. HYMANS--said.:   ,nA.s representative -of .the country first- :ln alphabetical order, - and convinced as .1 am &apos;. that .1 speak for my. colleagues, we are greatly-honoured at the confidence which the Council ha s - s ho to i n -u s.Animated.by the spirit so well defined by the President., we will strive to fulfil the duty which -is ours,  in a spirit of per-fect justice,  of perfect freedom and of perfect independence,
hoping, to -do&quot; &quot;the CounciJl/--u3-ef\il.-service- -and to solve- JLn.,full accord with all its members, and in tho . interest-sts of the general peace of the world, the grave problem the study of which is entrusted to us.&quot;M, QUINONES DE LEON:    I agree entirely with the remarks of M.. Hymans.M. WELLINGTON KOO:    I.also agree.Viscount ISHII:    I, therefore, put the resolution whichI have read to the&apos; vote.The resolution was unanimously adopted.-On the proposal of the- Secretary-General, the Councilauthorised the publication in full, of the record of themeeting.-2, Whitehall Gardens, S.Wi7th September, 1921.
