political developments whioh have led to the proposals to exercise the mandate by means of a Treaty will be found in the review of the Civil Administration referred to above and in the note on Political Developments enclosed herewith .Mr. Churchill suggests that the British representative on the Council of the league of Nations should take some suoh line as the following in order to explain to the Council the policy which Bis Majesty&apos;s Government have now decided to adopt :-He should circulate oopies of the Review of the Civil Administration and of the Note on the Political Developments for the information of the members of the league, at the same time as he provides them with oopies of the draft mandates fcr Mesopotamia and Palestine in their final form.   He should draw the attention of the Council to the fact that by Article 94 of the Treaty of Sevres the High Contracting Parties agreed that Mesopotamia should, in accordance with the 4th paragraph of Article 22, part (i) of the Covenant of the League of Nations be provisionally.recognised as an independent state, subject to the rendering of administra-tive advice and assistance by-the mandatory until it is able to stand alone;   and that Article 96 of the same treaty provides that the terms of the mandates in respect of the above territories  frail&apos; be formulated by the Principal Allied Powers and submitted to the Council of the league of Nations for approval.   Article 22 of the Covenant of the league of Nations lays down that the dogree of authority, control or administration to be exercised by the mandatory shall, if not previously agreed upon by the members of the League, be explicitly defined in each case by the Council.
The Supreme Council at their Meeting on Sunday April 25th 1920 at San TJemo decided that Great Britain was chosen by the Principal Allied Powers as mandatory for Mesopot-amia.    On December 7th 1920 Mr. Balfour submitted to the Secretariat General of the League of Nations a draft mandate for Mesopotamia for the approval of the Council.    The Council have not hitherto found it possible to expross an opinion on this draft, and meanwhile the political developments which are described in the Note which it is suggested that Mr.Balfour should oirculate have led His Majesty&apos;s Government to the conclusion that the exercise of their control as mandatory-would be more satisfactorily carried out in the form of a treaty to be concluded between&apos;His Majesty&apos;s Government and  the King of Mesopotamia than by the exercise of executive functions such as those contemplated in tho original draft mandate.     In addition to the general modification of view on the question of principle His. Majesty&apos;s Government have also been led by the experience of the past year to suggest certain minor alterations in and additions to the text of the mandate as submitted by Mr.Balfour in December of last year,    They thought it convenient to embody these alterations and additions in the document which is nov to be circulated in order to show that in spite of their having come to the conclusion that tho exact method of control should be exercised-. In-a somewhat different manner the substance of tho obligations into which they regard, themselves as having entered by their acceptance of the mandate has not been materially1 altered.-   They invite the Council of the League to concur&apos; in their view that it would be more in accordance with the spirit of the Covenant of the League of Nations and with the Interpretation of the phrase &quot;provisional Independence&quot; if tho mandatory were to establish his relations with tho local authorities by
-    402&apos;by treaty rather than by the exercise cf direct jurisdiction. They found themselves unable to resist the overwhelming desire of the people of Iraq for the formation of a National Government under an Arab ruler.     The march of events was so rapid that it did not admit of their consulting the Council jbefore taking steps of which theywere confident that that body Would approve, namely the recognition of the sovereign whose recent accession to the throne followed upon the universal demand of the people of the country.Mr. Churchill suggests that Mr. Balfour should then inform the Council cf the general tenour of King Feisal!s &apos;speech from the Throne and of his reply to the High CommJs-sioner as reported in the latter*s telegrams Nos, 422 and 427        J of the 25th August, emphasizing the readiness of His Majesty to give written assurances as regards the fulfilment of the tinternational obligations and obligations under the mandate which have been solemnly incurred by Hia Britannic Majesty&apos;s government.     He should point out that certain of these obli-        j gations, which were to have been entered upon by the mandatory      I on behalf of the Government of Mesopotamia in the mandate as drafted by His MajestyTs Government, would now be more con- )veniently undertaken by the Mesopotamian Government itself. IHe should inform them that while King Peisal is clearly ready and willing to include in his treaty with His Majesty&apos;s Government all proper provisions to ensure that the Govern- fment of Mesopotamia shall be carried on in strict conformity with the spirit of the Covenant of the League, it is in tho opinion of His Majestyrs Government undesirable that the treaty should aopear to subvert that independence vhich wasialready provisionally recognised even before there was ainational government in the country.     He should also draw theattention of the Council to the undertaking given by king feisal in his speech from the. Throne that the Organic law which he proposes to frame and which will be drafted in^ consultation/
ec^ultatlon with the High Commissioner shall establish freedom of religion and worship, ensure equity of commercial dealing with foreign countries and.will also set up a Judicial system which will safeguard the interests of foreigners and ensure them against any interference with their religion, race or language *Finally he should invite the Council to express an opinion on the general lines which the treaty between His Majesty^ Government and King Feisal should follow, suggesting to them -that, provided It secures!- firstly, the control of His Majesty1s Government over the foreign relations of Mesopotamia; secondly, due fulfilment of the international obligations in-curred by His Majesty&apos;s Government by treaty, mandate or agree-ment   thirdly, such measure of financial oontslol as may be necessary so long as Hie Majesty&apos;^ Government are assisting with men and money?   and fourthly, that it contravenes in no particular either the spirit or the letter of the Covenant of the League of Nations, it would provide a more satisfactory definition of the relation between the mandatory power and tho mandated state than any other form cf instrument.He should explain at the same time that His Majestyfe Government do not regard themselves as in any way absolved from their responsibility to the League by taking this step and that they will willingly furnish a yearly report on the administra-tion of Mesopotamia together with copies of all laws and regu-lations promulgated or issued during the year.     It may be of advantage for Mr, Balfour to make use of the argument that Article 18 of the draft mandate now circulated would have pro-vided that in the case of any modifications proposed by the mandatory, such oonsent might be given by the majority of the Council..Copy of this letter has been sent to the Foreign Office*-I am.
