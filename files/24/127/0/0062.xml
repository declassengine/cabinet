The most serious aspect of the situation is the possibility of trouble among the unemployed when the weather becomes cold. In Sheffield and the Midlands there is aIready much complaint.The Communist Party is making a show of activity in connection with the Russian Famine Fund, but Communism .gua Communism is practically dead in this country, and the collections made are very small*Hoacow has committed the tactical error of ordering the absorption of the Red Trade Union International and the Workers1 Committeoa in the Communist Party,   it is almost certain that these movements will in consequence lose their not inconsiderable hold on disgruntled trade unionists.Several meetings have been held in connection with the Poplar rates question, in addition to a &quot;Fair&quot; to raise money for the Council&apos;s legal suspenses:   a &quot;monster demonstration&quot; has been arranged for Tower Hill on August 28th.
330THE UNEMPLOYEDUnrest among the London unemployed, appears to be increasing, although no disturbances bava been reported during tho week.     There is privation in some of the poorer districts, particularly in the Docks area, and it is feared that unless conditions become &quot;better there, may &quot;be outbreaks of violence during the winter.     The London District Council, which is composed of communists, is working hard to build up a strong organisation.     The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is doing its best to inflame the feeling of the workers by describing conditions in various London Boroughs:   under such headings aa &quot;Starvation in Wandsworth&quot;, &quot;Camberwell*s Tragedy&quot;, &quot;Housing Horrors at Pinchley&quot;, &quot;Living Dead of Islington,&quot; harrowing descriptions of suffering and misery are published daily.Some indignation has been caused in connection with the enlistment of volunteers in the Spanish Foreign Leg ion, owing largely to misunderstanding regarding the number of men required.     The communists are, however, of opinion that it would be unwise to hold protest demonstrations as the men who would volunteer would be equally ready to break up communist meetings.The attendance of police at meetings of unemployed at W&amp;lham Green has had a sobering effect and Samuel Roddy has stated that he will not speak in public owing to the fear that action will be taken against him for violent utterances* A deputation of the Pulham unemployed headed by Sidney Hanson visited the Guardian^ Offices last week, and demanded that a special meeting of the Board be convened to consider their case.There was some attempt at a demonstration in Sheffield during the hearing of the oases against the unemployed rioterson/
on August 17th, as a result of which seven people were arrested for obstructing the police;    of the original offenders, six were sentenced to terms of hard labour varying from 14 days to 4 months, one was fined and two bound ever to keep the peace fo twelve months. Of the mon concerned in the demonstrationon August 17th, one was committed for&apos; trial at the Assizes on a charge of attempting to create disaffection among the police, three were fined and one was sentenced to 14 &quot;days1 hard labour while the charge against the seventh was&quot;withdrawn.   My-correspondent is of opinion that in spite of- the activity of oommunist agitators in Sheffield the great majority of&apos;the unemployed only want work at. a reasonable wage.It is reported from the Midlands that last week a large number of unemployed workers completed the period for which thej were entitled to draw unemployment benefit, with the result &quot;that] there is inoreasing discontents,    The men are becoming rowdy and unsettled, and welcome every opportunity of expressing their feeling.     Yagua threats of disorder are made should the benefit! not be extended,     The number of,unemployed meetings is increas In the Midland centres, and at all times of the day groups of- dissatisfied citizens can be heard discussing th3ir hopeless positions, in the various Market Places.     &apos;J?he Mayor*s Fond In Nottingham will close down on September 2nd and is already exhausted in Leicester:    in the latter city unemployment is aout and wil,l shortly be considered at a special meeting of the Council.     In the Birmingham districts, the cessation of &apos; unemployment benefit has also synchronised with the exhaustion of the funds of various relief committees and serious conditions are anticipated. ,   ,John McLean and his lieutenants are endeavouring ,to stir up trouble among the Glasgow unemployed and my correspondent thinkgthat/
331that their efforts may cause demonstrations against the Town Council, i.HlB,CQIvII.im:iI3TS  &apos;&quot;Russian Workers&apos; 7/eek&quot; is occupying the attention of communists throughout the country;     150,000 special famine leaflets have heen sent to divisional offices for circulation and although tho &quot;Herald&quot; greatly exaggerates particulars of the Communist campaign, the reports so far received indicate that tho audiences and collections have been larger than usual.     In Newcastle, for instance, 150 people contributed  2. 0. 3d. at one&apos; meeting, whereas the ordinary collections amount to a few shillings only.     Speakers at some meetings are avoiding political issues and appealing for money on humanitarian grounds and permission is being sought to make special collections in the streets and at work gates.     Branches are urged to make a special weekly levy for the benefit of the fund-     About 400 meetings have been arranged in the London area, 200 in Scotland, 120 in the   Midlands, and about 60   in Lancashire:   similar preparations have been made in o-i&amp;er parts of the country.The following illuminating extract denotes the plans of theCentral, -Test Central, and Soho London branches:&apos;&quot;Representatives of West Central and Soho branohes met our (Central London) committee yesterday to form a joint plan of campaign,     I was asked to write you and ask if you could immediately take steps to form a committee of- neutral people like the KayOr of Holborn and one or two like that who wotild approach the music halls and cinemas- with a view to taking collections for the Russian Famine Fund.     It would be advisable to try to wangle it so that the money goes to :Zing Street.and not to a bourgeois or national fund, but if this can11 be done we must put up:.with.it. .     to S^/r^^Si *fc^&quot;e.*fcs**i p&apos;3 ^^U:/--,-:--&apos;&quot;Gulliver, who owns the Palladium t   the Holborn Empire and several other &quot;plaoes, is one of the most important to approach,..and he is ;more broad minded than most, as you know,&quot;A small deputation of the committee.

oh August 2l3t the Communist Party held two meetings in Stevenson Square, Manchester: the afternoon meeting * attended by about 2,000 people, many of whom were foreigners of a very low type:   about 1,000 people werepresent at the evening meeting.     The speakers dealt chiefly with the Russian famine and two collections were taken at each, meeting.     Grossleye the Lancashire organ I g] has applied to headquarters to extend the visit of Gee fo another week as the results of his meetings are considere &quot;highly successful&quot;.     Trouble has, however, arisen regarding the communist caravan in which Jenkins recently started a tour,     Crossley complains that &quot;the oost of haulage by hire of horse and man is so prohibitive that i would swallow up more than the whole of the estimated revenue from the van:    it is therefore imperative that a horse be purchased at once.&quot;     Headquarters, however, reg that they are &quot;unable to arrange to, supply the horse for touring van&quot;, which has been left at Barrow until the matter can &quot;be thrashed out at the divisional Council meeting.&quot;My correspondents in the Midlands report increased communist activity in connection with the Famine Week and preparation for the &quot;Red Week1^ from September 7th - 15th, It is thought that the future of the Party will depend in great measure upon the success or failure of these weeks, The Executive is undoubtedly anxious that its efforts to raise money should he accepted, by Russia as proof of its worthiness tc share the largesse of the Third InternatiomThe Coventry communists, after heated interviews witljthe solicitor of the Independent Labour Party, have sett!the debt arising from the seizure of the Party&apos;s rooms.sum of  45 appears to have been raised locally,  50 sent from headquarters and  80 borrowed from a cinema managerNun ea ton

Last week ail permanent officials were informed that their engagements would terminate on August 20th:   a full time national secretary is being elected by ballot and more officials will be appointed should finances permit.Efforts are now being made to effect the amalgamation of the Communist Party, the Red Trade Union International and tho Workers* Committees into &quot;one united political and industrial movement.&quot;      Should the fusion take place it seems probable that the Communist Party, which appears to have scored heavily, will swallow the other organisations, of which its officials have long been jealous:   on the other hand, there are many hundreds of workers who are converts to industrial/

About 500 people, including 300 ex-Service men were present, many of whom had marched from Marble march,   The speakers, who included 23. T. Doffee, Bert Iteffee, Loeds, LyloB Harding,&apos; Captain Alford and the Hov. - Thomas, dealt Chiefly with the policy of:the Government in regard to trainees;   during the meeting a deputation visited Bowning Street but found that the Prime  Sinister was absents   The chairman referred to the fact that the &quot;Communistn had been, distributed gratis during tho meeting and holding up a copy, tore it up, saying, &quot;This Is what I think of this.&quot;   His action &apos;was cheered by the audience which appeared to have no sympathy with Communism.My correspondents report that an excellent spirit of unity and progress is growing among ex-Service men. in the Midlands as the result of the formation of the British Legion:    there is, however, a certain a count of resentment against Wagstaffe, the &quot;man in chains&quot;, who is touring the oountry and presenting petitions on behalf of ex-Service men to mayors.SINN ftm Iff GREAT BRITAINModerate Irish opinion 13 beginning to assert itself in Great Britain in spite of extremists who are interested in the prolongation of strife:   many of the more responsibl Irish favour acceptance of the Government offer and resent the adoption by Be Valera of the rolo of dictator. Art 0*Brien and his immediate associates are cr.ld to be firmly opposed to a plebiscite, which they think would result in favour of a settlement,
- - 9 - 334It is reported that, many members of the Irish Republican Army, who are. &quot;ou. the run&quot;, In Great Britain, have dooided to abandon tho organisation:    they appear unwilling to return to. Ireland for a winter campaign, should such take plaoe.The acquittal of all Glasgow prisoners, charged in .connection with the recent attack on a prison van, has caused great- re. jo icing, in Sinn Fein circles, hut a dispute has arisen over tho. manner in which the &quot;Defence Committee&quot; handled the affair:   Art 0fBrien wag asked to,,intervene but -was requested by the Scottish Sinn Fein Executive &quot;to mind:his ....own businesso&quot;. ,Accusations of petty theft have been made by Tom :McDonnell against-Jack Q^gheohan,, the,Scottish organiser, who^ has in consenuence tendered Ms resignation.On August 22nd 0&apos;Brien and Phipp, two-members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, v/ere each sentenced to 10 years&apos; penal servitude for &quot;conspiring to further the objects of the. Irish Republican Brotherhood-, or Sinn Fein, by the unlawful use of force and violence&quot; and for attempting to Induce soldiers to steal rifles:   Comarford and p&apos;po,laneil were sentenced to 3 years*. penal servitude for being in unlawful possession of revolvers, and ammunition.... There, are indications . that the Scottish people are becoming very hostile to the. extremist Irish element, and resent the existence of Irish sedition clubs and the open animosity, displayed to. .loyal subjects^ ...--According to recent reports, there is an increase in the smuggling of arms and ammunition to Ireland on Glasgowboats, cm -    $4pt?h &amp;i  , , ..In Lancashire a great majority of Irish people, many of whom are avowed Sinn feiners, consider the Government terms generous and hope that they, will be accepted.   A section of extremists, however, profess great   faith inDe Valera and Bail Eireann end will support them in any action/
w   10  to action they decide to take.   Local Irish loyalists are anxious for peace but regard the terms as far too good and make no secret of the fact that they consider the leaders of Southern Ireland to he murderers.A&apos; person who Is in a position to know from Irish    i ecclesiastical circles the Views of the moderate Sinn feiners states that De Valera&quot;o&apos;&quot;real difficulty la that i the Prime Minister has offered the Irish what they do act want, and the one thing&quot;they do want - unity with    i Ulster - h&amp; has no power to giro them.   Their dream la to control a united Ireland.   Nevertheless the leaders seem to feel that the tide of public opinion abroad is &quot;running against them and this may; have a cumulative effect with every day that passes.Whatever may be t&amp;girareal intentions, they are certainly not relaxing their efforts to procure war material and to re-organise thoir departments at home    j and abroad.Reports are constantly being received of gun-runnin particularly on boats leaving ports in the vicinity of I Glasgow.: 5?he Republican Police are coming much to the fore,! and Sinn Fein Courts are hearing cases in :many parts cl the &quot;country. w.*y*.&amp;i,The drilling of the Irish Republican Army is kaiagi carried: &quot;out more openly, and training camps are to be found in many parts of Ireland.There is some doubt, even amongst the extremists, whether It v/ould be wise to start the fight again, and thus stand a chance of alienating American sympathy. The whole crux of the matter is Ulster.   It is   lmpo3si to forecast, but those extremists who have lost relativ
in the &quot;war&quot; are all in favour of prolonging the negotiations as long as the? can until the Republican machinery is in good working order, and then of forcing the issuo.The majority of the members of .the Hail ?*ireann are members also of the Irish Republican Army and the meeting of the Ard Oomhairlo or High Council of Sinn Fein, summoned for August 23rd, is really to ascertain the views of the civilian element.Rumours as to peaoo must be accepted with oautiOn as it is believed that instructions have been issuad to spread such rumours in order to prolong negotiations and to divert suspicion from preparations that are being secretly made to porfect the machinery of the Irish Republican Army.
