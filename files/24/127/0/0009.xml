[This Borametitjs the Property of HisBritannic Majesty^ Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1921.SECRET.cabinet.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for-the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 1st instant.General State of the Country.There has been no change in the general situation since my last report. Apart from a few incidents of a comparatively unimportant character, the truce arrange-ments are working smoothly and satisfactorily, and the allegations that have appeared in a certain section of the London press to the effect that the occasion is being seized by Sinn Fein for the open drilling and strengthening of its forces are not borne out by the reports of responsible police officers throughout the country whose duty it would be to bring such facts to light if they existed. On all sides it is agreed that Ireland is experiencing a period of rest and of greater freedom from violence than she has enjoyed for many years, and that there is a universal desire that the present conditions may be allowed to continue. Whatever may be the outcome of the present peace negotiations, there can be no doubt that they are being conducted under the external conditions most favourable to their success.Trials of Civilians by Court Martial.Sentences in twenty-nine Court Martial trials of civilians were promulgated during the week, twenty-six of this number being convictions and three acquittals. The following is a summary of the punishments inflicted : 1 sentence of penal servitude for life.. 10 sentences of penal servitude (5 years to 15 years). 9 sentences of imprisonment with hard labour (8 months to 2 years). 5 sentences of imprisonment without hard labour (1 month to6 months). 1 fine of  5.Total 28The life sentence was inflicted for the offence of carrying firearms and ammuni-tion, and sentence of 15 years&apos; penal servitude in one case and 10 years&apos; penal servitude in two cases were imposed for the possession of arms and ammunition. Sentence of 15 years&apos; penal servitude was imposed in another case for the offence of cutting down telegraph poles and destroying telegraph apparatus. The other sentences of penal servitude ranging from 5 years to 7 years were on convictions for the possession of firearms and seditious literature.tInternment Orders.The following statement shows the position as regards internments up to the 30th ultimo :-Orders made      ...        ...        ... ...        ...     4,202Orders cancelled for reasons other than release       134 Releases ordered ...        ...        ...        ...       377        511Number of persons now,interned    ... ...         ...     3,691The number of appeals awaiting hearing is 15. &quot;67401

In the case of Patrick Clifford and Michael 0&apos;Sullivan, which came before the House.of Lords on appeal from the refusal of Mr. Justice Powell, a judge of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice in Ireland, to grant a writ of prohibition restraining the Commander-in-Chief and the Military Governor of the Martial Law area from carrying out the sentence of death passed by a Military Court upon the appellants on a charge of having been found in the possession of arms and ammunition, their Lordships unanimously decided that the Military Court, the validity of whose sentence was called in question, was a body possessing no statutory or common law authority, and that there was no precedent for the issue of a writ of prohibition except to a recognised Court of Law. The appeal in respect of this writ was therefore dismissed, and the House of Lords declined to express an opinion as to whether a writ of habeas corpus could properly have been granted if applied for, but Lord Summer indicated that in his view if the appellants were entitled to any relief at all it would be by that writ and not by writ of prohibition. He added, however, that he must not be taken as expressing any doubt on the validity of the judgment of the King&apos;s Bench in Ireland which had refused to issue a writ of habeas corpus.The second case which was brought before the Master of the Rolls in Ireland was a habeas corpus application on behalf of two prisoners, John Egan and Patrick Higgins, the circumstances of whose case were in their legal aspect precisely similar
to those of the recent case of John Allen and J. Garde, in which a writ of habeas corpus had been refused by a court consisting of the Lord Chief Justice and the full Court of King&apos;s Bench in Ireland. The decision in Allen&apos;s case rested on the ground that a state of war existed throughout the area covered by the Proclamation of Martial Law,&quot; and that the ordinary Courts of Law could not interfere with the prerogative powers conferred upon the Commander-in-Chief for suppressing the rebellion and restoring order. This decision, it will be observed, follows closely upon the judgment of the Privy Council in the South African war case of ex parte Marais (A.C. 1902) whicli laid down the principle, that where actual war is raging, acts done by the military authorities are not justiciable by the ordinary tribunals, and held that the application of this principle was not excluded by the fact that the civil courts were performing their ordinary duties in the whole or part of the war area.Without challenging the correctness of the Marais decision in other circum-stances, the Master of the Rolls held that it had no application to a case where the acts done by the military authorities were not done in the exercise of the prerogative powers conferred upon the Commander-in-Chief, but were governed by statute and contrary to the unanimous opinion of the Court of King&apos;s Bench in Allen&apos;s case and Garde&apos;s case, he laid it down that any powers of a judicial nature exercisable by the military authorities in Ireland at the present time are governed by the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act, 1920, which was passed for the express purpose of meeting the same emergency in respect of which Martial Law was subsequently proclaimed, and must, therefore, be regarded as regulating and limiting the actions to be taken by the military authorities for dealing with that emergency.Applying the provision of the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act to the particular case he found what of cburse was not in dispute-that the composition of the court was not in accordance w7ith the requirements of that Act, and that there was no statutory, or common law authority for the passing of a capital sentence for the offence of the possession of arms and ammunition. Consistently with this view of the law there would appear to have been no possible alternative to the granting of the writ of habeas corpus, and this course was accordingly taken by the Master of the Rolls who decided that the prisoners Egan and Higgins should be produced in court on Friday the 29th ultimo. In view of the previous conflicting decision given by a court of greater standing, the Commander-in-Chief at once served notice of appeal against this order and decided, pending the hearing of the appeal, to retain the prisoners in custody.In taking this course there was, needless to say, no intention of flouting the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery, and it was not contemplated that the Master of the Rolls would think it necessary to precipitate a grave constitutional crisis by issuing writs of attachment to enforce his authority.A conflict of judicial opinions on a purely legal question is obviously a matter which can only be settled by a higher judicial authority, but in view of the practical difficulty of securing an early hearing of the appeal, and the question as to whether an appeal lies at all, and in order to avoid the appearance of a public scandal, the Commander-in-Chief was instructed to release both the prisoners without prejudice to any further action that may be taken against them when the legal position has been determined.H irish Office, S.W., August 6, 1921.
