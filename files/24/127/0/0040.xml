DRAFT UNSTARKSD QUESTION.To ask the Minister of Labour what action the Government have taken with regard to the draft Conventions and Recommendations adopted at the seoond meeting of the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation, held at (Genoa loth June to 10th July, 1920.DRAFT REPLY.The Conference referred to by my hon. yriend, adopted three draft Conventions and four Recommendations.   These have been published as a Command paper (Cmd. 1174/1921).   The first draft Convention fixed the minimum age for admission of children to employment at sea.   This proposal is oovsred by the Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment) Act, 1920.   The Convention was ratified by Order of Council on 5th July, 1921, and came into operation on registration by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations on 14th July, 1921.   The second Convention concerned Unemployment Indemnity In case of loss or foundering of the ship. I am not yet in a position to make a definite statement on the subject, but xit is possible that effect may be given to the Convention when a Bill to amend the Merchant Shipping Acts is -introduced.   The third Zraft Convention dealt with the establishment of facilities for finding employment for seamen.   Effect cart-be given to this Convention without the introduction of fresh legislation.   H.L. Government propose to defer formal ratification until thoy are satisfied that full effect is being given to the Convention.    In addition to the above mentioned Conventions,  the Conference adopted four Recommendations.   The first of these recommends the limitation of hours of work in the Fishing Industry. There are difficulties in the way of such limitation and E.lu. Government have decided not to accept this Recommendation.   The second Recommendation concerns limitation of hours of work in      - -Inland Navigation.   The same decision applies in this csos-/The
The third Recommendation deals&apos; with the establishment of National Seamen&apos;s Codes,   Effect pould be given to this Recommendation by the introduction of legislation consolidating the kerchant Shipping Acts.    In the view, however,  of my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade, while such consolidation is desirable, it is not by any means necessary ana would not, under Ordinary circumstanc os, bo under talc en yet. In view of the great pressure of urgent parliamentary worisj the Board of Trs-do prefer to postpone the question of such consolida-tion at the present time.   The fourth Recommendation concerns the establishment of schemes of Unemployment Insurance for Seamen..   Effect is already given to this Recommendation under the Unemployment Insurance Acts 1911 to 1921.
