Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1934.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 215 (34).CABINET.EGYPT.THE telegram (No. 210 bf the 7th September) from Cairo warning us of the serious state of King Fuad&apos;s health and of the critical situation which might arise if he suddenly died, is strongly reinforced in a despatch from the Acting High Commissioner, dated the 14th September, which has just been received. The annexed Memorandum by the Permanent Under-Secretary gives a connected account of the recent course of Anglo-Egyptian relations, and I invite my colleagues&apos; earnest consideration of the immediate problem.The view, which I formed when I became Foreign Secretary, that it was undesirable to hurry treaty negotiations with Egypt, has been strengthened by the course of events. Previous negotiations for such a treaty have broken down because we could not satisfy Egyptian aspirations, and, in my view. Mr. Henderson&apos;s draft went further than the present Government would think it right to go, so that the prospect of reaching immediate agreement with Egypt on this subject did not really exist. Hence, when I saw Sidky Pasha in Switzerland two years ago this month, I told him that, while we recognised that the Government of which he was the head had the necessary authority to speak for Egypt, we could not contemplate entering into treaty negotiations without real grounds for believing that they would succeed, and consequently it was necessary before any such course was entered upon to have a clear understanding on such essential matters as the location of British troops and the status of the Sudan. Sidky Pasha&apos;s subsequent illness and fall from power, and the less satisfactory character of subsequent Egyptian Governments, together with the increased ascendancy of the Palace combined with its growing unpopularity, have necessarily postponed all present idea of treaty discussions. In addition to the strong reasons for not attempting them at present which are to be derived from the Egyptian internal situation, it would surely be most unwise to encourage a resumption of such negotiations at a time when the Indian Constitution is one of our grave preoccupations, and wrhen the suggestion that we were tampering with the Egyptian link might be exploited in a most dangerous fashion.But the main point to which I wish to draw my colleagues&apos; attention in the face of these new Egyptian anxieties is that if, indeed, King Fuad died and internal trouble in Egypt was threatened owing to these fantastic provisions . about the choice of a Regency, and to the outbreak of discontent with the Palace l-iregime and its consequences, this gives us a great opportunity for vindicating i&apos;the claim which we make to maintain our presence in Egypt.   The great mass of the Egyptian population will be heartily glad that we are there if we do the right thing and at once.   Our claim that we must maintain our exceptional position in Egypt, not only for Imperial reasons, but in the interest of Egypt itself, will thus be justified by immediate results.    Even though Egyptian Nationalists and their sympathisers outside Egypt may protest, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.   And, on the other hand, if we are hesitant and ineffective, our moral justification for our presence in Egypt will disappear, and there are others e.g., Italians who will lose no time in exploiting the opportunity for substituting their influence for ours.I therefore submit that we should give instructions, both to the necessary departments at home and to the Acting High Commissioner, such as will make 7592   [10563] b
ourselves ready for the eventuality which may occur. The main objective will be to be prepared to do what is necessary to support law and order if outbreaks occur consequent upon the King&apos;s death. Apparently it is impossible to decide in advance as to what names would or would not constitute a suitable Regencv, but on this matter we can give the Acting High Commissioner our support and accept his guidance. Sir Miles Lampson, whose leave has been long overdue, need not, I consider, be sent back at present, especially as Mr. Petersen is a substitute with intimate knowledge of Egypt, but of course he would hold himself in readiness to return should the blow fall.I formulate, for Cabinet consideration, conclusions on the following lines : (1) The abandonment for the time being of any attempt to negotiate a political settlement in Egypt. We should pursue a policy of benevolent but not inactive opportunism, and, in doing so, ... .(2) Concentrate on the development of economic relations between the two countries with a view to bringing it home to the Egyptian people that their unescapable connexion with the United Kingdom is of valuable material benefit. As a concomitant of this, it is proposed to investigate cai&quot;efully the possibility of concluding an Anglo-Egyptian Commercial Treaty.....(3) Authorise the High Commissioner to use his influence to bring about a betterment of internal political conditions in Egypt, with special reference to a more efficient administration of the country in the interests of the people as a whole rather than of the privileged few. . . . .(4) Authorise the High Commissioner to discuss with the Egyptian Government, as they arise, matters to which they attach importance, and particularly such immediate problems as the reform of the Mixed Courts.....(5) Accept the principle that, in the event of the death of the King of Egypt (or some other internal political crisis), it wall be the duty of the High Commissioner,to use his influence to secure a regency (and/or Cabinet) acceptable both to the country and to His Majesty&apos;s Government. This would mean approval of the proposed action outlined in the Acting High Commissioner&apos;s despatch dealing with the developments which may be expected to occur on the death of King Fuad, with the additional understanding that he may find it necessary to secure the immediate adjournment of Parliament after the reading of the King&apos;s nominees for the regency, and ....(6) Authorise the High Commissioner to endeavour to ensure the maintenance of internal order in the event of a political crisis caused by King Fuad&apos;s death by letting it be known among the political leaders that the Department of Public Security will, if necessary, be supported by British forces.J. S.September 21, 1934.Memorandum.To appreciate the political situation in Egypt, it is necessary to go back to June 1930 when Sidky Pasha became Prime Minister. After some months of his rule the impression gained ground in the Foreign Office that the stability of Sidky Pasha&apos;s position was such that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom could afford to negotiate with him. Accordingly a new draft treaty was prepared, which it was proposed to show to Sidky Pasha once the agree-ment of the Service Departments had been obtained to its terms with a view to ascertaining whether it would form a likely basis for successful negotiations. In actual fact, Sidky anticipated this action by broaching the subject with the Secretary of State in Switzerland in September 1932. Sir John Simon replied that, while he had had no opportunity to consult his colleagues and there had been no Cabinet decision on the subject, he felt that it might ultimately be possible to negotiate along the general lines of the offers of 1929 and 1930. There were, however, two points that he must emphasise. The first was connected with the disposition of the British forces once they were removed from the cities. On this, modifications, as compared with earlier proposals, would be required. The second point was that we should not be able to consent to any alteration in the

209existing status and administration of the Sudan. The conversation concluded with an understanding that Sidky Pasha should open informal conversations with the High Commissioner in Egypt, while the. Secretary of State would refer the matter to the Cabinet. The draft treaty was then despatched to the Service Departments for their observations. As, however, they were unable to reach agreement with the Foreign Office over the question of moving our troops to the Canal Zone, it was decided at a Cabinet meeting held on the 12th July, 1933, that no communication should be made to the Egyptian Government on the subject of the proposed treaty negotiations, and that, if or when the Egyptian Govern-ment pressed for a reply to the advances made by Sidky Pasha, they should be told that our immediate preoccupations would make it impossible to begin conversations at once, but that we contemplated doing so some time in 1934. Actually, the Egyptian Government never have pressed for an answer. In January 1933 Sidky Pasha had a stroke and in September he resigned. The Palace took the opportunity of Sidky&apos;s convalescence in Europe to undermine his position, and, when the new Cabinet was installed in October, the change to the regime which now obtains, became complete. The unpopularity and weakness of Yehia Pasha&apos;s Cabinet has relegated the question of immediate treaty negotiations into the background, and, when instructions were given in February 1934 to the new High Commissioner, Sir Miles Lampson was told not to commit himself in any way about a treaty, but, having acquainted himself with his new surroundings, to furnish his views as to the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government could, in the altered circumstances, most advantageously pursue.Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s report was received towards the end of July. While faithful to the ideal of an eventual political settlement as the ultimate goal of our policy, he is opposed to any attempt to negotiate such a treaty at the present moment or in the immediate future. He is equally against what has been for the sake of convenience described as the &apos;&apos; bargaining asset policy &apos;&apos; of avoiding, so far as possible, discussing any major question (e.g., the reform of the Mixed Courts) with the Egyptian Government in the belief that our prospective support vis-a-vis the other Capitulatory Powers for the removal of Egyptian grievances would be a powerful lever for the securing of a satisfactory treaty under which such problems could be tackled. Instead, the High Commissioner, in expressing the opinion that to refuse to consider Egyptian grievances because we cannot  or should not negotiate a treaty with an unrepresentative Egyptian Govern-ment would be tantamount to obstruction (especially since it is arguable that our occupation of the country in its present form is at least partially responsible for the existence of such an Administration), recommends the piecemeal solution of problems as they arise in co-operation tvith the Egyptian Government. At the same time, he advocates the strengthening in every possible way of the economic relations between the two countries so as to convince Egyptian opinion of the material value of Egypt&apos;s inescapable political connexion with the United Kingdom, coupled with increased intervention on our part in Egyptian internal affairs to correct present, and prevent similar future, abuses. It seems desirable to explain at this stage that it has been a logical outcome of His Majesty&apos;s Governments Declaration of Egyptian Independence in February 1922 that British intervention in the internal affairs of Egypt should have diminished. An outward sign of this diminution is provided by the progressive reduction in the numbers of British officials in the service of the Egyptian Government. There have been occasions since 1922 the murder of Sir Lee Stack leaps to the mind as an example when it has proved necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to intervene, and in no uncertain manner, but, with the appointment of Sir Percy Loraine as High Commissioner in 1929, it may be said that what had been a natural development became a deliberate policy. It now appears evident that that policy of non-intervention has, with the elimination of Sidky&apos;s strong control, led not only to the present highly unpopular and corrupt autocratic regime  which is giving rise to increasing discontent throughout the land but also to a gradual deterioration in administrative efficiency which is now rapidly becoming-apparent, at least in the departments specially subject to political interference, such as the Ministry of the Interior. Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s policy is one of pure opportunism, in the success or failure of which the personality of the High Commissioner must necessarily count for a great deal; and, in this connexion, it is to be observed that, on being asked what guarantee there could be of the [10563] B 2
suggested increased intervention being made effective without constant alarms and excursions in the shape of ultimata supported by the despatch of warships to Alexandria or other coercive measures, he replied that, in the first place, no major issue would be embarked upon without prior consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government, and, in the second, everything would depend upon the methods personally employed in approaching the King or Prime Minister.In the meantime, events ai&quot;e moving fast in Egypt, and it would seem that, whether we like it or not, an opportunist policy, such as that advocated by the High Commissioner, is the only one we can possibly follow. Thus, the deter-mination of the Egyptian Government to raise, treaty or no treaty and with or without our agreement, such issues as that of the reform of the Mixed Courts, with special reference to the application of Egyptian legislation to foreigners, seems to dispose effectively of any desire we may still entertain to cling to so-called &quot;bargaining assets.&quot; It is inevitable that a highly unpopular Government should search about for some sops to the people, and it will be appreciated that the whittling clown of foreigners&apos; and infidels&apos; privileges is about the safest road, from the national point of view, that they could tread. So far as this particular question is concerned, the High Commissioner and his advisers on the spot are to be congratulated on having been able so far, while maintaining the friendliest relations, to deflect the Egyptian Government from the exaggerated line which they were originally inclined to follow. Other matters in which it has been necessary of late to advise the Egyptian Government are the public debt problem, the protection of religious minorities, and the control of missionaries, and the reform of the Alexandria Municipality following the scandals of the Corniche Road contracts, to give a very brief selection. But these complexities pale into insignificance in comparison with the crisis which would surely be upon us and possibly at a very early date on the death of the King of Egypt.His Majesty&apos;s health has left much to be desired for a long time, and has lately taken so menacing a turn that the Acting High Commissioner (Mr. Peterson) has reported that a fatal seizure may supervene at any moment. The Crown Prince (Farouk) is only just 15 years of age. The Constitution lays down that, in the event of the King dying before his heir has attained the age of 18, a Regency of three dignitaries will be appointed. These dignitaries will be chosen by the Monarch during his lifetime and their names enclosed in sealed envelopes, one to be retained in the King&apos;s personal archives and the other in the Presidency of the Council. The envelopes are to be opened after the death of the King and in the presence of Parliament. Owing to the King&apos;s extreme sensitiveness in the matter of his own health, coupled with the fact that discussion of after-death is apparently taboo in Moslem etiquette, it has proved impossible to ascertain who have been chosen by His Majesty as regents. In view, however, of the influence which for a long time has been exerted upon the gradually failing King by Court favourites, and in the light of His Majesty&apos;s dislike of the majority of the political leaders in Egypt, it is gravely feared that his choice, whatever it may be, will prove unacceptable to the country as well as to ourselves.The situation likely to develop on the King&apos;s death has lately formed the subject of correspondence with the Acting High Commissioner and has been discussed with Sir Miles Lampson as well as with the (British) Financial and Judicial Advisers to the Egyptian Government, who are or have been on leave in this country. All are agreed that, while there may be no particular reason to anticipate immediate popular disorder, this is to be feared should any attempt be made to continue after the death of the King the present unpopular regime (the advisers, indeed, go further, and suggest that, even if the King lives, as he may, for any length of time, popular resentment against the present Adminis-tration will eventually break out). The implications of this statement are serious because it is known that the Egyptian police (particularly in the provinces) are, thanks to the persistent neglect of the Government, in an inefficient and discontented state. If this force fails to maintain order, the obligation resting upon His Majesty&apos;s Government to protect foreign lives and property in Egypt will compel the use of British troops for the restoration and maintenance of order and here it may be mentioned that, should we evince any particular hesitation to meet our responsibilities in this matter, it is even possible that some other Capitulatory Power (such as, in particular, Italy, whose policy in the Near East has lately been unduly active) would threaten to intervene for the protection of its own nationals. In all the circumstances, therefore, it is essential for the Residency to be ready to act, and to act decisively, immediately on the King&apos;s
death with the objects of (a) securing a regency acceptable to the country as well as to ourselves, and (b) ensuring the maintenance of internal peace.It is suggested that if these objectives are to be attained the High Commissioner must see to it that Parliament is adjourned immediately after the seals of the King&apos;s letter have been broken in their presence and the names of his nominees read out. In the almost certain event of the selection being undesirable, it will be the task of the High Commissioner to secure the withdrawal of the unwanted and their replacement by candidates who would enjoy the confidence of the people. It is considered desirable that if possible at least one of the triumvirate should be representative of Wafdist opinion. The actual selection of individuals must, however, depend on circumstances, and in this His Majesty&apos;s Government can therefore only be guided by the High Commissioner on the event arising. As regards public order, the High Commissioner may have, if necessary, to ensure that it is fully appreciated in the circles concerned (i.e., the Wafd) that the King&apos;s death will not mean the paralysis of the Department of Public Security, whose efforts will, if necessary, be supported by British forces. It is thought that a hint of this nature in the proper quarter will exert a power-fully calming influence upon those who, in its absence, might be tempted to try and exploit the situation for their own ends.It may well be asked what guarantee there can be of the High Commissioner being able, for example, to persuade unsuitable regents to withdraw. The answer is that politically Egypt is to-day in a demoralised state. Although the Wafd can probably still count on the allegiance and support of 90 per cent, of the masses, the responsible minority of political leaders have not forgotten the extravagant futilities of the extremists. Equally hated is the corrupt and reactionary Palace clique now in power. Great numbers of the Egyptian people, apart from the politically-minded, while far from desiring any return to Cromerism, look to Great Britain for help. Nine months ago when Sir Miles Lampson assumed his appointment, it was believed that this help was at hand. Since then the situation has deteriorated with increasing rapidity and it is not too much to suggest that, if we fail to assert ourselves, if or when a crisis occurs, chaos may well ensue. Certainly our position would be gravely impaired by further inaction. The possibility, in the actual state of bewilderment, of any effective opposition to constructive intervention on our part is one that must necessarily be accepted, but that can be accepted without alarm.Foreign Office, September 19, 1934.
[J 1673/9/16] ANNEX 1.Sir M. Lampson to Sir John Simon. (Received July 16.) (No. 629.   Secret.)Sir, Ramleh, July 7, 1934.IN paragraph 4 of your secret despatch No. 130 of the 13th February I was instructed, after such interval as might be necessary, to formulate and submit my views as to the general policy to be adopted towards Egypt, whether by means of a treaty or otherwise; and in paragraph 5 of the same despatch I was invited to express an opinion in advance, after consulting the General Officer Commanding and the Air Officer Commanding, as to the advantages and disadvantages in connexion with any treaty settlement of moving the British troops from the neighbourhood of Cairo and Alexandria.2. The instructions in this latter paragraph I carried out to the best of my ability in my despatch No. 342 of the 16th April, 1934. I remain of the opinion therein recorded that, if we do not move our troops from the two cities, no treaty is possible.3. There remains the larger question put to me in paragraph 4 of your despatch namely, the question of our general policy in Egypt.4. Before proceeding to answer that question, it seems essential to be clear what exactly are, or should be, the aims of British policy in this country. And here I am fortunate enough to have received a recent definition from the Foreign Office of what the essential requirements of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Egypt are. I refer to your despatch No. 448, Confidential, of the 13th June, where those requirements are summarised as : (a) The recognition of our right to maintain forces in Egypt, together with the right in time of war or disturbance to enjoy all facilities which Egypt can provide; (b) the admission by Egypt that the administration of the Sudan since 1924 has not been in violation of the convention of 1899 and shall be carried on in conformity with that convention; (c) the recognition by Egypt that, if and when she requires foreign assistance, she will apply for it to His Majesty&apos;s Government and to no other foreign Power.5. To put the problem even more briefly and in less detail, I should be inclined to describe it as reconciling the aspirations of the Egyptian people with the special interests of Great Britain in Egypt and I myself should summarise those interests as essentially and primarily the safeguarding and protection of Imperial lines of communication, e.g., the Suez Canal, and maintenance of our strategic base in the Near East.6. How then are these essentials of British policy to be obtained? It is not an easy question to answer; for, as I see it, we are, in fact, trying to reconcile two inherently irreconcilable principles of traditional British foreign policy, namely, (a) the principle of self-determination and non-intervention in the internal affairs of another country, Egypt; and (b) the vital necessity of self-preservation, e.g., Imperial communications.7. I have pondered much over this problem and I can see only one real ultimate solution, namely, some form of incorporation within the orbit of the British Empire. Maybe some form of Imperial connexion in a form not yet evolved and which time alone and the course of events will dictate. An inde-pendent or quasi-independent-kingdom within the Empire sounds, on the face of it, a contradiction in terms. Yet events may prove that this is not necessarily so; and perhaps something on the lines of a glorified independent Indian State, sufficient to satisfy Egyptian nationalist aspirations and yet adequate to meet our requirements may prove possible. I do not know; the future alone will reveal. But at the risk of starting an unwelcome train of thought, I feel bound to record that my own ideas run on the above lines as the ultimate ideal solution.8. So much said, I hasten to add that I do not regard anything of the sort suggested in the preceding paragraph as a matter of present practical possibility. Our prior commitments are too great; Egyptian opinion (and I surmise British opinion also ?) is not yet ripe for anything of the sort.9. What then remains ? After careful reflection and with some misgiving, I can see no immediate alternative to a treaty policy i.e., a policy of alliance with Egypt.   Not an ideal solution, but with things as they are, past events as they
are, and our earlier commitments to Egypt such as they are, I see no workable alternative.10. By treaty policy, I, of course, mean a treaty in every way satisfactory to ourselves and adequately safeguarding British interests as defined above. If we cannot achieve that, we should sign no treaty and should declare frankly and formally why we cannot do so and that we regard our earlier commitments towards Egypt as finally liquidated, leaving us with a completely free hand to deal with the resultant situation as seems to us best. We should then fall back upon a policy of frank and open opportunism, shaping our policy from day to day in accordance with events as they occurred always keeping our eyes on the beacon light the proper safeguarding of lines of Imperial communications.11. So much said, I do not at the moment see that we could safely or wisely initiate treaty discussions. We have to deal with a minority, indeed a purely palace regime. The Opposition (the Wafd), having, say, 95 per cent, of the people behind them would certainly repudiate (in party interests if for no other reason) any agreement concluded with the present Government. Therefore, the wise course is to wait till something more solid, more national, evolves with which to negotiate. In other words, either a Wafd Government, or some combination (not at present in sight) enjoying Wafd support or participation. Even then let it be Egypt and not we who make the first overtures.- 12. This policy, if adopted, probably entails some interval, possibly a fairly considerable one.   What then should be our line meantime ?13. Once more I should advocate a policy of opportunism in the best sense of the word. Let us let it be known, at an opportune time, that a treaty policy, on terms acceptable to us, remains our fundamental line. Let us meantime, as I feel we inevitably must, quietly and unostentatiously interest ourselves once more, more directly than we of late have done, in the government and adminis-tration of the country. Nothing need be announced regarding that; but it should be done, and, of course, done with all discretion. For example, if abuses come to our knowledge which exceed reasonable limits, let us strive to check them. All Egypt, in its heart of hearts, looks to us to do this. For our own good name, I do not see that we can act otherwise. At the moment the palace dominates everything every sphere of Government activity. Abuses must obviously occur in such conditions in an oriental country. Quietly, and behind the scenes, we should strive to check such abuses, as and when they come to our knowledge, by quiet &apos;&apos; advice,&apos;&apos; but &apos;&apos; advice &apos;&apos; sufficiently firm to ensure its adoption. Once it is realised that we are in earnest, there need be no fear that such &quot; advice &quot; would be disregarded.14. One final point. There is undoubtedly a general and growing admission amongst serious-minded Egyptians that the fortunes of Egypt are, in the nature of things, closely and inextricably linked with Great Britain, owing to the accident of Egypfs geographical position on the map. Let that opinion be encouraged and strengthened in every possible way. And I venture the opinion that the more the economic ties of the two countries can be tightened the better. Politics follow economics; the more joint Anglo-Egyptian co-operation in the practical economical sphere the better. I am myself not without hope that if that line of activity were more systematically fostered, a permanent solution of our problem might gradually emerge automatically possibly, even something on the lines of some British imperial combination, such as adumbrated in paragraph 7 of this despatch.15. I am very conscious that this despatch and the submissions it contains may be regarded as shallow and inadequate for so deep and vital a problem as the final determination of our relations with Egypt. I can only record that the views expressed are the result of much anxious thought, after hearing the views and observations of a very large number of persons, official and unofficial, and without regard to party.16. I have the honour to request that any shortcomings in this, my report, may be treated with indulgence, in view of the shortness of my stay in this country, and of my entire lack of previous experience of Egyptian affairs.I have, &amp;c.MILES W. LAMPSON,High Commissioner.
ANNEX 2.Mr. Peterson to Sir John Simon. (Received September 7.) (No. 210.   Most Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Alexandria, September 7. 1934.KING FUAD&apos;S health.Prime Minister, upon whom I made formal call on 5th September, did not conceal his anxiety as to state of King Fuad&apos;s health, which he attributes to His Majesty&apos;s inability to refrain from overworking. Visit to Greece, which is tentatively-fixed for middle of October, remains problematical. It may be paid by Crown Prince.I now learn through Mr. Keown-Boyd, in strictest confidence and on the authority of the five doctors at present attending His Majesty, that the trouble is an aggravation of a long-standing affection of the kidney, to which must be added the effects of an attack of angina-pectoris which His Majesty apparently sustained some five years ago. Medical conclusion is that there is at least a possibility of a fatal heart attack supervening at any moment.His Majesty, who has suspended all audiences for some weeks past, has sent me a message that he will be prepared to i&apos;eceive me next week after my return from Port Said. I propose to submit, as soon as possible thereafter, the considerations which this situation seems to suggest.ANNEX 3.Sir R. Vansittart (for the Secretary of State) to Mr. Peterson (Alexandria). (No. 189.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, September 11, 1934.YOUR telegram No. 210 of 7th September (health of King Fuad), mentioning possibility of fatal seizure at any moment, indicates that we may be confronted without warning with serious difficulties. In this connexion I should be glad to learn as soon as possible what in your view would be likely to be course of events in Palace and ministerial circles in the event of the death of the King, particularly with reference to his nominees for the Regency Council. The names so far suggested (see Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s despatch No. 705) can obviously inspire no confidence whatever. They would, on the contrary, seem almost ridiculous and therefore dangerous. But even if we were satisfied on this point, is there any possible safeguard against the sealed envelope, which the King is to leave behind him, being tampered with in the interval between His Majesty&apos;s demise and its opening in the presence of Parliament ? I have in mind, of course, the possibility of some such manoeuvre by Ibrashi, which might lead to trouble. Would there, in your view, be any advantage in raising the question of the Regency with the King in the hope of ascertaining what is in his mind ? The disadvantage would be, I understand, the risk to the King&apos;s health owing to his fear of mentioning death.So far as I can judge, it is a virtual certainty that, as matters stand, the King is at the mercy of advisers who may be expected to endeavour to exploit his death for their own ends. In the interests of Egypt it may therefore be necessary to advise His Majesty in this matter, and I should therefore be glad to know whether you have any names in mind which could be regarded as responsible and trustworthy regents acceptable to the country.We assume that the King&apos;s death would in any event be a dangerous moment, inasmuch as it is bound to give rise to public effervescence, which the opposition parties, and particularly the Wafd, may seek to encourage. Recent reports on the discontent in the police (see Residency despatch No. 765) suggest that this may - easily get out of control, necessitating intervention for the protection of foreign
lives and property. Please submit your views and recommendations on this point and, in fact, let me have your promised despatch with all possible speed.Your telegram makes me feel that we might now conceivably be confronted at short notice with a critical or at least important situation on which, apart from any advice given in Egypt, we must be prepared in advance to advise His Majesty&apos;s Government if required.ANNEX 4.Mr. Peterson to Sir John Simon. (Received September-14.) (No. 220.   Important.)(Telegraphic.) Alexandria, September 13, 1934.FOLLOWING for Sir R.

Most Secret.)Sir, Ramleh, September 14, 1934.I HAVE the honour to inform you, with reference to my telegram No. 210 of the 7th September, that the state of King Fuad&apos;s health and the situation which will present itself, should his malady have a fatal issue, continue to cause me grave preoccupation.2. There seems to be little doubt that King Fuad&apos;s present illness is really serious. As reported in my telegram under reference, the trouble appears to be an aggravation of a long-standing affection of the kidney, to which must be added the effect of an attack of angina pectoris, which His Majesty apparently sustained some five years ago. I am informed that there are symptoms of ureemia, and risk exists of a fatal heart attack supervening at any moment. During my audience on the 13th September I was impressed by the change in His Majesty&apos;s appearance since I took leave of him five years ago. His colour is yellow, his eyes deeply sunken and lifeless, and he has the shrunken look of a sick man. He spoke, however, with spirit and humour, but I suspect that he keyed himself up specially for the occasion.3. The constitutional position on the death of King Fuad so long as Prince Farouk is a minor is, as recorded in Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s despatch No. 705 of the 4th August last, governed by the decree of the 13th April, 1922, the relevant articles of which were therein enclosed, and by articles 50 to 55 inclusive of the Constitution. Article 55 of the Constitution, in particular, prescribes that the constitutional powers of the King are exercised, in the name of the Egyptian people, by the Council of Ministers and under its responsibility during the period between the death of the King and the &quot; Taking of the Oath &quot; by the Regents before the assembled Chamber of Deputies and Senate.4. The period immediately after the death of King Fuad is likely to be a critical one. The present regime, which is not accepted by more than a small minority of Egyptian opinion, exists by virtue only of His Majesty&apos;s will and support; its artisans have no authority in the country save in so far as they are believed to enjoy His Majesty&apos;s favour. Of the three powers in Egypt the Palace, the People and the Residency King Fuad has, during the last four years, imposed the Palace on the People, and the role of the Residency has been one of studied effacement. The removal of the linchpin of the present regime may well have momentaiy consequences of chaos and confusion. There is, indeed, a real risk, if the Regents nominated by King Fuad are mere creatures of the present regime, and as such antipathetic to the mass of local public opinion, that popular discontent may seek to express itself in violence. The Minister of Finance recently declared that, if the King died and a thoroughly unacceptable list of Regents became known, there might be a military coup d&apos;Etat. In his opinion, the army is not to be relied on. I have also heard it suggested that the fellaheen in the areas around His Majesty&apos;s country estates, who have for years been subjected to forced labour and expropriation, might endeavour to avenge themselves for past wrongs. The chances of a popular movement directed by the Wafd, with or without some colour of republican propaganda, cannot entirely be discounted. In any event, some dislocation in the interior adminis-tration, consequent on the stampede towards new loyalties, must be expected.
5. I feel it my duty to record these somewhat alarming prognostications, but I am of opinion that reality is lent to them mainly by the fear that the King&apos;s death will change nothing and will merely perpetuate present conditions.6. This fear would find justification if the Regents nominated by the King prove to be creatures of the present regime and if the Residency continues to maintain an attitude of disinterest. But I believe that, if it were immediately known on the King&apos;s demise that Regents to whom public opinion could not refuse the qualities of trustworthiness and honesty would exercise the King&apos;s consti-tutional powers during the minority of Prince Farouk, the dangers inherent in the situation would be vastly diminished, and a wave of relief and hopeful expectancy would tide the country over the immediate perils of angry impulse and emotional despair.7. It is important that the Residency should be associated in the public mind with this relief. Indeed, I see ho hope of its coming without Residency intervention.8. I am still without information as to the personality of the Regents nominated by King Fuad. Sidky Pasha, who vouches for the accuracy of the information, stated to the Minister of Finance on the 27th August that His Majesty&apos;s nominees were, at one time, Prince Gamil Toussoun, Adly Yeghen Pasha and Tewfik Nessim Pasha, and that during his own premiership Zaki-el-Ibrashi Pasha and Mohamed Taher Pasha were substituted for Adly Yeghen Pasha and Tewfik Nessim. He did not know what had been done about Prince Gamil Toussoun, who has been deprived of his title and is in disgrace. Tewfik Nessim Pasha confirms that he was on the list and has been removed from it. Ibrashi Pasha is not qualified (see enclosure in Sir M. Lampson&apos;s despatch No. 705 of the 4th August, 1934), but I think we can take it that he and Taher Pasha are two of His Majesty&apos;s three selections. (It is just possible that article 11 of the decree of the 13th April, 1922, enables Parliament to appoint, or to confirm the appointment of, an unqualified nominee.) Taher Pasha is, of course, qualified as being the King&apos;s nephew. The rector of Al Azhar may be the third nominated Regent, but this is only guesswork.9. None of these Regents can be considered as desirable. Collectively, their nomination might well precipitate a conflagration.10. It is not easy to suggest entirely satisfactory alternatives. I feel, however, that a Regency Council consisting of Prince Mohamed Ali, Tewfik Nessim Pasha and Sheikh Mohamed Mustafa-el-Maraghi would be generally acceptable. Sheikh-el-Maraghi is not qualified under the decree of the 13th April, 1922, but he would be an admirable selection; and I am assuming, in any case, a degree of intervention on our part already unprovided for in any relevant legislation.11. Prince Mohamed Ali is fairly popular; he presents well, and is not unfriendly disposed to us. The acting oriental secretary considers that his temperament and a long habit of authority might make him a difficult colleague in a Council of Regency, and that public opinion might be shocked by the selection of a Prince whose family feud with King Fuad has been notoriously bitter. He is incidentally Prince Farouk&apos;s heir presumptive. Mr. Grafftey-Smith prefers the more colourless personality of Prince Abdel Moneim, who is on good terms with King Fuad and has no particular will of his own.12. If a wider field of selection is sought, more or less satisfactory Regents could be found among the following : Mohamed Shafik Pasha, Hafez Afifi Pasha, Ahmed Ziwer Pasha, Mahmoud Fakhry Pasha, Seifullah Yusry Pasha, Ibrahim Rateb Bey, Abdel Aziz Fahmy Pasha, Amin Anis Pasha, Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha, Gaafar Waly Pasha, Cherif Sabry Bey, and the present Prime Minister.13. If I may dismiss any expectation that King Fuad&apos;s nominees will prove acceptable, and if I may assume as necessary some intervention on our part to ensure the substitution of a more satisfactory Council of Regency, the question arises how and at what moment this intervention should become effective.14. Advice to His Majesty, however forcefully conveyed, offers, in my opinion, no solution. King Fuad would fiercely resist a suggestion tending to transfer any shadow of his authorit)^ and prerogative after his death to individuals with whom he is now at feud. It will be realised that His Majesty has, in the present regime, an instrument admirably adapted to his ideal of government, and that for the last four years the touchstone of Royal favour has been acceptance of this regime.   That he should consent to abandon for his son
the position won and held by himself against the forces of progressive democracy is inconceivable. The nomination as Regent of any critic of the 1930 Constitution would, for him, constitute some such posthumous abdication. Discussion of the subject with His Majesty would be in any case both delicate and difficult; it would almost certainly be futile. Even apparent compliance on King Fuad&apos;s part would, I fear, offer no real security.15. We must therefore, I think, await the event and prepare for inter-vention after His Majesty&apos;s demise.16. It is difficult to analyse with any precision the elements of a situation so hypothetical. The problem is gravely complicated by the fact that the Cabinet, which exercises the Royal authority during the period immediately following the King&apos;s death, and Parliament, which meets within ten days of the death to learn and to confirm the nomination of the Regents, are, as at present constituted, interested primarily in a perpetuation of present conditions, and may therefore be assumed as hostile to any personality unsympathetic to the present regime. It seems probable that both Cabinet and Parliament would, in effect, sign their own death-warrant by approval of any Regency Council acceptable to ourselves. With a different Cabinet in office, the mechanics of intervention would be greatly simplified. As things are at present, I anticipate considerable disarray in Palace and Ministerial circles, and a tendency on the part of some of those in authority to turn to the Residency for support, and possibly guidance; but it would be idle to expect from Palace, Cabinet or Parliament any ready complicity or co-operation in the substitution of our selected Regents for those nominated by King Fuad.17. The country as a whole, however, will look to us to take the initiative, and will not, I think, be surprised at any action on our part following on King Fuad&apos;s death, though some nationalistic resentment of our intervention may immediately, and will certainly later, find more or less sincere expression. The strength of our position lies in the unpopularity of the present regime and in the hopes aroused by the prospect of any change, however irregularly effected. The problem lies, apart from any risk of spontaneous disorders or anti-dynastic movement, in reconciling the imposition on the powers-that-be of measures distasteful to them though congenial to the Opposition with the maintenance of discipline and order in the army, police and general administration.18. I feel that it may be necessary, at a given moment, to make our intentions known to the various political leaders, including Nahas, and to enlist their aid in maintaining internal stability during this critical period. Those now in authority, who have most to lose by the King&apos;s death, may not be wholly unwilling that we should temporarily take charge of the situation. Those in Opposition may welcome a development designed to facilitate a bloodless transition. The thought that serious internal disturbances must provoke our even more forcible intervention will be present, for good or evil, in the minds of all.19. I do not feel that I can usefully examine further the mechanics of the process of intervention, which must, in the nature of things, draw largely upon the improvisations of the moment. I should, however, be glad to learn as soon as possible whether the general line of argument of this despatch meets with your approval, and I should especially value any instructions which, so far as is possible in so hypothetical a case, you may feel able to give me.I have, &amp;c.MAURICE PETERSON,Acting High Commissioner.o
