Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1934.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 197 (34).CABINET.THE SOUTH AFRICAN HIGH COMMISSION TERRITORIES.Question of Transfer to the Union of South Africa.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN my memorandum CP. 262 (33) of the 10th November last I circulated a letter, dated the 1st October, 1933, which I had received from General Hertzog regarding the question of the transfer of the South African High Commission Territories (Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland) to the Union of South Africa. At the subsequent meeting of the Cabinet on the 15th November it was agreed that I should explain to General Hertzog that it was not felt that the present was a suitable time for raising this question with the native population of the Territories, with a view to the submission of the matter to Parliament here.2.   I now annex : (a) A copy of a letter dated the 27th November, 1933, which I sent to general hertzog in accordance with the conclusions reached by the Cabinet at the meeting of the 15th November;(b) A copy of General Hertzog&apos;s reply dated the 25th April, 1934; and(c) A copy of a further letter, dated the 16th July, which I have now sent toGeneral Hertzog.3. The letter to General Hertzog of the 16th July was seen in draft by the High Commissioner for South Africa (Sir Herbert Stanley), who fully concurred in its terms.(Initialled) J. H. T.Dominions Office, July 19, 1934.ANNEXES.Dominions Office,My dear Hertzog, Downing Street, November 27, 1933.I brought before the Cabinet your letter of the 1st October about the question of the transfer to the Union of Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland, and with it the memorandum sent to me by Smuts in July last.You will, I expect, have seen the memorandum which I handed to Smuts earlier in the month in which were set out the various considerations which we are bound to take into account in connexion with this matter including, in particular, the pledges which have been given both to Parliament and to the inhabitants of the Territories. You will, I am sure, agree that in view of these pledges it would clearly not be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom even to consider the question of transfer without taking steps to ascertain the opinion of the population, both native and European, on the subject.[10326] b
I now write to let you know that my colleagues and I, after fully discussing the position, feel that the present is not a suitable time for raising this question with the native population of the Territories, with a view to the submission of the matter to Parliament here, which, as you will see from the memorandum handed to Smuts, successive Governments have promised to consult before any decision as to transfer is taken.I hope, however, that we may. continue to have your friendly co-operation in dealing with the various economic and other problems with which the Territories are now faced. I feel sure that the difficulties mentioned in the memorandum which Smuts sent to me are not insuperable-1 notice, for instance, that reference is made to the absence of immigration restrictions between the Territories and the Union, but I may mention that an Immigration Law for the Bechuanaland Protectorate was issued last year, and a similar law is being issued in Swaziland. I am asking Stanley to consider the other points of this kind referred to in Smuts&apos; memorandum.I greatly appreciate your personal invitation to Mrs. Thomas and myself, and I should like to accept it if circumstances permitted, but at the moment the political and international situation is such that I fear that I cannot say with any certainty whether it will be possible for me to get away next year.Yours sincerely,(Signed)    * J. H. THOMAS.Prime Ministers Office, My dear Thomas, Capetown, April 25, 1934.It was with a feeling of disappointment that I read your letter of the 27th November last, in which you state that you and your colleagues feel that the present is not a suitable time for raising the question of the transfer to the Union of the Government of Basutoland, of the Bechuanaland Protectorate and of Swaziland.  I had confidently hoped for a more reassuring response.As the matter is almost daily becoming more pressing and acute you will, I hope, forgive me if I find it necessary to place my views before you once more with complete frankness. Failure to do so, while it might contribute to the encourage-ment of a continuation of possibly erroneous conceptions of the true position among responsible statesmen in England, might, I fear, otherwise prove very detrimental to the interests of the Union no less than to those of the Territories concerned.It is my firm conviction that the attitude adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in England with regard to this question, as appears from your letter, cannot be continued much longer without creating a very unfavourable state of feeling in this country, which is already becoming more and more insistent.The position to-day, with respect to these territories, is very unsatisfactory, and I and my colleagues fear that, if the present position be allowed to continue much longer, the relationship between the Union and the Territories and their respective inhabitants will more and more assume a less friendly aspect and give rise to feelings of hostility which may permanently affect their relationship, to the detriment of all concerned.Quite frankly, the position of the Union with respect to these Territories, whether viewed from the economic, administrative or judicial aspect, is, for reasons, inter alia, set out below, fast becoming intolerable.As His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are aware, while the agricultural well-being of the Union is a matter of the very gravest concern to its people, the Union is constantly afflicted by the visitation of agricultural pests and diseases which can be combated only by the unintermittent exercise of administra-tive alertness, energy and skill, and at the cost of huge sums of money, sometimes amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds. Within its own borders the Union Administration can cope, as it has in the past coped, successfully with these pests and diseases, such as scab, East Coast fever, foot-and-mouth disease, locusts, &amp;c. From time to time, however, there have been recurrences of certain of these diseases and pests which have initiated not within the borders of the Union, but within the native territories here under consideration, and which, it is felt, would either have not occurred at all or would have been successfully suppressed at an eardy stage if these territories had been under the administration of the Union.
The present campaign which is being waged against the invading lucust swarms affords typical illustrations of what has been experienced in the past and has to be expected by the Union and its people as long as the present position in respect to the native territories is allowed to continue. The Union Administra-tion has so far coped successfully with this very severe infestation within its own borders. But all its efforts and all the expense must practically be fruitless unless an equally determined campaign is also carried on - in the infested native territories.Unfortunately, however, this has so far not always been the case. Difference of opinion as to methods of procedure and as to other matters bearing on the problem of extermination has to a very large extent served to increase the difficulties with which the Union has had to struggle in its attempt to destroy the invading swarms, and has been responsible for much of the loss suffered through the destruction of crops in the Union. &quot;What has taken place in Swaziland may be here cited in illustration. As late as the 16th February last the locust situation in Swaziland was reported upon as quite satisfactory. Within ten days after, however, the Union Department of Agriculture was informed that swarms of hoppers, which would reach the flying stage in ten ov twelve days, were crossing the Swaziland border into Union territory. Thereafter the position in Swaziland grew from bad to worse and eventually got out of hand, with results which at one time promised disaster to sugar planters in Natal and to farmers in Eastern Transvaal. While officials differed and territorial susceptibilities had to be observed, the locust had been given a holiday,What has just happened in the case of the locust campaign is, however, no more than a repetition of what has before occurred in the case of the eradication of foot-and-mouth disease, East Coast fever, scab and other diseases and pests, and as long as the present position of the territories is maintained, such evil happenings will of necessity repeat themselves.Geographically, the territories concerned form as it were integral portions of the Union, and unless in matters and times of emergency and urgent necessity affecting farming operations the closest co-operation is observed and a uniform policy applied under common control, the interests of the Native Territories, no less than those of the Union, will be exposed to the greatest hazard.From the point of view of the Union, the above considerations alone appear sufficiently important to call for an immediate and serious attempt to deal with the question of the transfer of the government of the territories as contemplated by the legislature in 1909. There are, however, other no less weighty and pressing-considerations to which I feel attention should be called.The present position, for instance, with regard to the application of Part II of the Fugitive Offenders Act, and supplemental legislation, whereby Union inhabitants along the Bechuanaland border are compelled to appear before Protectorate Courts in sparsely populated districts, where travelling is difficult, to answer or to give evidence concerning charges which in the result often appear trivial, and frequently cannot be substantiated, is must unsatisfactory and has already given rise to very serious dissatisfaction amongst the European farmers of the Union. Already on several occasions of late representations have been made to the Government here against Union citizens being compelled to appear before those Courts as witnesses, at great cost and personal discomfort; and insisting that the extradition of Union citizens to the Protectorate shall only take place subject to the procedure and safeguards obtaining internationally, and I fear that unless a change be effected either in the administration of the Protectorate by a transfer to the Union, or by a revision of the terms of the existing Agreement, conflict between natives of the Territory and whites along the border in the Union will become more and more difficult to avoid. There are other related questions of peace and good government, upon which, however, it is not my intention to detain you here.The entry of natives from the Protectorates into the Union in search of employment is, however, another and more urgent matter requiring special mention once more because of the very great importance which it is fast assuming in the economy of the Union and the very unpleasant problems to which it is bound soon to give rise unless an early transfer of the government of these territories takes place. From 10,000 Basutos, who until recently found employment in the Union, the number has increased to 35,000, owing largely to a policy of the very utmost friendliness and consideration advisedly pursued by the [10326] b 2
Union up to the present as against these territories and their inhabitants, often at the cost of its own citizens. The exigencies, however, of the preservation of good order, and of efficient administration, no less than the economic conditions and requirements of Union natives and Europeans, are now demanding that the present policy shall in various respects be revised.At present, for instance, the vast majority of natives from the Territories employed in the Union are, strictly speaking, prohibited immigrants, while, at at the same time, they are ousting Union workers from the employment market. This is an anomalous position which in the past could be defended upon the ground that these Territories were destined soon to be handed over for administration by the Union. As this promised transfer is now felt to be overdue, strong adverse comment is making itself felt; and soon the Government here will be compelled to take action, unless some definite assurance can be given by your Government that transfer will be effected within a reasonable time.A similar position obtains in regard to the privileges enjoyed by the inhabitants of the territories natives and Europeans with respect to their products in the markets of the Union. Their competition is sometimes, as in the case of live-stock, tobacco, dairy products, &amp;c, felt to such an extent by the Union producers that complaints and protests are not seldom heard both in and outside Parliament, and no satisfactory answer can be made as long as these territories remain in their present position of total independence of the Union.It can, therefore, be foreseen that if these territories are still for any length of time to remain outside the administrative control of the Union, it will become increasingly difficult, if not impossible, for the Government of the Union to continue to extend to their inhabitants the enjoyment of the rights and privileges of citizens in the labour and other markets of the Union.You will therefore pardon me if, finally, I once more draw your attention to the provisions of section 151 of the South Africa Act, 1909, which clearly contemplates the step which it is now desired by me and my colleages should be taken. The present time seems to us to be most opportune, and the position as it exists at present cannot be allowed to continue much longer.You will, I am sure, realise that it is not intended by me to cast any aspersions on the manner in which the Territories are being administered. On the contrary, I have no fault whatsoever to find with their administration as&quot; such; and whatever the cause may be of the unsatisfactory state of things which here and there has given rise to comments by me, it must not be sought in the administration, but in the peculiar circumstances and conditions whereunder the administration has been, and necessarily must be, carried on.I confidently hope, therefore, that you and your colleagues will reconsider the decision which you have communicated to me, leaving it to the Union to give such safeguards in respect of the matters which may cause concern to you as will be conducive to a satisfactory conclusion of the question.Since writing the above, I have had a conversation with Lord Clarendon, who informs me that when he was in England last December you asked him to inform me, when the occasion offers, that although you have not been able to visit us this year, as was hoped, you still contemplate doing so next year, when you will go into the question of the territories and their transfer. I need hardly tell you that your visit will be much welcomed and appreciated as an earnest endeavour on the part of the British Government to meet the just claim and wishes of the Union.Yours very sincerely,J. B. M. HERTZOG.The Right Hon. J. H. Thomas,Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Dominions Office, London, S.W. 1.General The Hon. J. B. M. Hertzog.My dear Hertzog, .  Downing Street, July 16, 1934.I thank you for your letter of the 25th April on the question of the transfer of Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and Swaziland, to the Union of South Africa.
May I say at once how much I appreciate so full and frank a statement of your views on this matter? I entirely agree that it is highly desirable that there should be no misunderstanding as to the true position. It is from this point of view, and in no controversial spirit, that I should like to discuss the various difficulties which you mention in your letter.In the first place, you say that, while the Union can cope successfully within its own borders with the various agricultural pests and diseases by which it is constantly afflicted, &quot;from time to time, however, there have been recurrences of certain of these pests and diseases, which have initiated not within the borders of the Union but within the native territories here under consideration, and which, it is felt, would either not have occurred at all, or would have been successfully suppressed at an early stage, if these territories had been under the administration of the Union.&quot; You cite as a typical illustration of this the recent campaign against the red locust.I am sure that you do not intend to suggest that the invasion of parts of the Union by the red locust either originated in, or could have been prevented by, these Territories. As Kemp pointed out in the Union Parliament on the 29th January, the crux of the problem presented by the red locust is that it is not indigenous to South Africa but comes from Central Africa, and that its permanent breeding grounds lie somewhere north of the Zambesi instead of, as in the case of the brown locust, in relatively accessible parts of the Union and the Bechuanaland Protectorate. Moreover, owing to the great distances which the migrating swarms can cross without intermediate breeding, and the enormous area infested, it is clear that Swaziland and the Bechuanaland Protectorate could not constitute barriers against the swarms formed in neighbouring territories, and that no measures taken in them can protect the Union from the danger of invasion or even diminish it to an appreciable extent.I assume then that the suggestion is not that this invasion could have been prevented by the Territories, but that the existing administrative position added to the difficulty and expense of suppressing it in the Union. As to this, you are, of course, aware that last December, as soon as the gravity of the situation became apparent, the Union were asked whether they would again be willing to assume the direction, as they had done in the past, of any anti-locust operations that it might be thought advisable to undertake in Swaziland and the Bechuanaland Protectorate, with, of course, all possible assistance from the local Adminis-trations. In the Bechuanaland Protectorate, the Union agreed to take over the direction of the campaign, which was accordingly conducted, on the same scale and lines as in the Union, by Union officers with the co-operation of the local Administration, to the whole-hearted character of which I am glad to see that the Union officer in charge paid a tribute on the conclusion of the campaign. You will also recollect that, though the Government here were advised that a campaign on this scale was neither necessary from the point of view of the interests of the Protectorate nor likely to be successful, we agreed, as good neighbours, to bear a share of the cost of operations which the Union considered to be necessary in their own interests. In the circumstances, I think you will agree that, so far as the Bechuanaland Protectorate is concerned, the existing adminis-trative position cannot be said to have increased the Union&apos;s difficulty of dealing with the red locust, while it has substantially reduced their expenses.In Swaziland, unlike the Bechuanaland Protectorate, the Union did not intimate any willingness to undertake responsibility for the campaign, which was accordingly carried out by the local Administration. This, however, does not affect my point, which is that, had the Union Government desired to assume the direction of operations in Swaziland in the same way as they did on this occasion in the Bechuanaland Protectorate and in the past in both these Territories, the local Administration would have co-operated to the utmost of their power with the Union authorities.In view of this I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by discussing the relative degree of success achieved by the Swaziland campaign against the red locust. I feel bound, however, to say that my information does not confirm that, owing to differences between officials and territorial susceptibilites-bilities, the locust was given a holiday there. On the contrary, I understand that, at the invitation of the local Administration, the Chief Locust Officer of the Union visited Swaziland towards the end of February to advise on the position
there and that he then expressed satisfaction both at the scale of the operations and at the methods adopted. I am assured that after this visit there was no relaxation of efforts and that the local Administration, with the strenuous assistance of the white and native population, did everything that was humanly possible to cope with a pest in whose suppression they were vitally interested. It is not, of course, claimed, that the campaign was successful in extirpating all the hoppers that hatch out on uncultivated lands and mountains, an achieve-ment which the Union Authorities have themselves publicly stated, with reference to the position in the Union, to be impossible. I am, however, assured that, so far as exports and imports of this undesirable commodity are concerned, the Union balance of trade with Swaziland was what is known as a favourable one!I propose to follow your example in not entering into detail into this question so far as it relates to the control of other agricultural pests and diseases, though I may observe that the experience of the last twenty-five years shows that the Administration of these Territories have not been unsuccessful in dealing with such matters. For example, I believe that I am correct in saying that east coast fever has been controlled in Swaziland as effectively as in the Transvaal; sheep scab has been adequately dealt with in Basutoland; lung sickness has been eradicated from the Bechuanaland Protectorate; and the recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the Protectorate did not originate there and was promptly and energetically met by the inoculation of some three-quarters of a million cattle in the infected area within a period of nine months. But what I am most concerned to emphasise is that, so far as I can see, there is no reason why the closest co-operation and completest uniformity of aims and methods, which the recent locust campaign has shown to be not incompatible with the present position of the Territories, should not be pi*acticable throughout this important sphere of common interests.I now come to the second of the questions raised in your letter, namely, the fugitive offenders&apos; procedure in relation to the Bechuanaland Protectorate. I was aware that certain difficulties had arisen a year or so ago in connection with this matter, but I was under the impression that they had been adjusted to the satisfaction of the appropriate authorities in the Union, who expressed appre-ciation at the time of the action taken to meet them in this matter. I gathered that the Union authorities were not anxious to alter the existing arrangements for dealing with fugitive offenders so far as the Union and neighbouring territories were concerned, but that they were naturally concerned to ensure that summonses or warrants of apprehension should only be issued against inhabitants of the Union where a prima facie case could be established and where the available evidence was such as to afford a reasonable prospect of a conviction. I need hardly say that the last thing that we wish is that the procedure should be used in any vexatious manner and you may be assured that the Protectorate authorities are thoroughly seized of the importance of bearing the above considerations in mind. In point of fact, so far as I am aware, no further trouble has since occurred in connection with this matter.The third question raised in your letter relates to the entry of natives from these Territories into the Union in search of employment in the mines or else-where. On this you write that &quot;from 10,000 Basutos who until recently found employment in the Union, the number has increased to 35,000, owing largely to a policy of the utmost friendliness and consideration advisedly pursued by the Union up to the present as against these territories and their inhabitants, often at the cost of its own citizens.&quot; As to this, the figures of passes issued to Basutos for employment in the mining areas, to which I assume your own refer, do not seem to show any marked increase of recent years. Thus in 1926 they showed 34,500 issued for the mines, besides 60,000 issued for other forms of employment outside the Territory; and that this state of affairs was even then not a recent development is shown by the fact that in 1908 78,000 Basutos left the Territory to seek work. It seems also relevant to point out that the number of natives recruited for the mines from Portuguese territories exceeds the total number of natives from the High Commission Territories employed in a similar capacity; that the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Labour Resources in the Union in 1930 (quoted in the Official Union Year Book), referring to &quot; the chronic shortage of native labour for the gold mines,&quot; stated that except for a short period in 1924 there had not been an adequate labour supply for many years; and that the Union
Government have recently decided to relax, as an experiment, the prohibition on the employment in the mines of natives from north of latitude 220 south. I agree that this phenomenon, which appears to be the result of the operation of the demand for labour in the Union on the supply available in neighbouring territories, raises serious problems from the point of view of its effects both on the internal economy of the Union and on the social structure of the Territories. Here again it seems to me that the solution to these problems lies in close co-operation, and the joint working out of a policy which will take into account all the complex considerations involved. But I cannot see how it would be furthered by transfer, which in itself would merely mean that under Section 18 of the schedule to the South Africa Act the Union would be debarred from imposing any discriminatory restriction whatever upon the entry of natives from the Territories into the Union.Finally, there is the question of the importation of products from the Territories into the Union, as to which you say that no satisfactory answer can, under existing conditions, be made to complaints by Union producers that they are suffering from the competition of producers in the Territories. Surely, however, this does not take into account the advantages derived by the Union as well as by the Territories from the free interchange of products provided for by the Customs Agreement. That the market of the Territories is of some quite appreciable value to the Union will, I think, be conceded; and in view of the fact that the Territories draw the bulk of their imports from the Union it seems to follow that any curtailment of their exports, by reducing a purchasing power which is chiefly expended in the Union, must in the end be paid for by the Union in the form of diminished purchases of Union products. I appreciate, of course, the desire of the Union to protect their markets from being flooded, particularly by cattle of inferior quality. But you will no doubt agree that under Section 17 of the schedule to the South Africa Act, transfer would necessarily involve the removal of even the present restrictions on the admission of cattle from the Territories. In the circumstances does not the remedy really lie on the lines recommended in the report of the Fiscal Conference between representatives of the Union and the Territories at Cape Town in May 1932, that is to say by the working out and introduction of a scheme of orderly marketing and regulation of supplies ?I have endeavoured to show why, as stated in my letter of the 27th November, I feel that the various difficulties which you have mentioned are not insuperable. In each case their solution seems to me to lie, as, indeed, you yourself have suggested, in the closest association and co-operation between the Union Govern-ment and the Territories&apos; Administrations. I am convinced that it is on such lines that, in the long run, lies the solution of the larger problem, to which I now turn, that of the future of the Territories in relation to the Union.In my previous letter I said that my colleagues and I, after fully discussing the position, felt that the present was not a suitable time for raising the question of transfer with the native population of the Territories with a view to the submission of the matter to Parliament here, in accordance with the pledges given by successive Governments. Our attitude to the question of consultation with the inhabitants cannot be better stated than in the words of Mr. Amery&apos;s despatch of the 4th December, 1925, of which a copy was handed to you at the time by Lord Athlone. Mr. Amery, in discussing the question of the transfer of Swaziland, then wrote inter alia: &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government are bound by the pledges which they have made to submit the Union Governments proposals to the European and native inhabitants of the Territory. It will be readily appreciated that the greatest prudence would have to be observed in selecting the right moment to consult the inhabitants of the Territory and in framing the proposals to be submitted to them, since if the reception accorded the proposals were such as to render it necessary to withdraw the application, it would be hardly possible to revive the question for some years to come.&quot;Mr. Amery added : &apos;&apos; I think also that General Hertzog will agree, in view of his statement in the Union Parliament on the 25th March, that it will be desirable that the consultation with the inhabitants should take place before any formal steps are taken in the Union Parliament.&quot;
The reference in the last words was to your statement, in reply to a question in the Union Parliament, in which you said, inter alia, as regards the question of the transfer of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, that if the people of the Protectorate, natives as well as Europeans, did not desire to come into the Union, you were &quot; not prepared to have them incorporated into the Union.&quot; As regards Swaziland you stated : &quot; But in Swaziland, too, as I have said, I have taken up the position that, unless the people are prepared and desire to come in, I am not going to insist on their coming in.&quot;The present position, as we see it, is this : All our information goes to show that the result of consultation with the inhabitants of the Territories with regard to transfer would, at least so far as the natives are concerned, not be likely to be such as to enable transfer, on the basis of your above declarations, and of our pledges, both in Parliament and to the inhabitants of the Territories, to be proceeded with. Such a situation would, it seemed and still seems to us, be embarrassing and undesirable from every point of view. It was on this ground that we arrived at the conclusion that the moment was not an opportune one for raising this question. This is still our view, but I would repeat that we should welcome the closest association and co-operation, particularly on economic matters, on the lines indicated earlier in this letter.As regards the last paragraph of your letter, the prospects of my being able to visit South Africa in the near future are, I fear, still doubtful, but in any case we are looking forward to seeing you over here for the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the King&apos;s Accession. I need hardly say that I shall be very glad to discuss the whole question further with you then.Yours sincerely, (Signed)      J. H. THOMAS.i
