(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).S E C R E T.n.Pc  188 (54).COPY NOC A E I N EVISIT OP MONSIEUR BARTHOU AND PROPOSAL FOR EASTERNLOCARNO PACT.Memorandum &quot;by the cjecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.the course of discussions with Monsieur- Barthou at the Foreign Office on July 9th and 10th.      The main results may be summarised as follows.Majesty&apos;s Government would &quot;be prepared to urge upon Germany, Poland and Italy the giving of their approval to the Eastern Locarno pact, the plan for which has emerged from discussions between M. Litvinov and M- Barthou.      In the case of Poland and Germanys the approval would involve their signature of the Pact to which they would be parties;    in the case of Italy, the approval would be without consequential liability. 3. The form in which M. Barthou first expounded theproposed Pact was open to the objection that it was associated with and conditioned upon a Franco-Russian guarantee which provided no corresponding assurances to Germany if Germany was attacked by France or Russia   as the case might be.      To the scheme in this form I took strong objection, pointing out that it could not be regarded as analogous to the Locarno Treaty, for under the Locarno Treaty guarantees were reciprocal and operated as much in favour of Germany as of France, whereas M. Barthou&apos;s scheme would naturally be regarded as the association of France and Russia for their mutual protection against Germany without any reciprocal assurances to Germany.1.Detailed records are being circulated which describe2.M. Barthou expressed the  strong hope that His
4. We therefore insisted that if we were t o show any interest in the proposal for an Eastern Locarno (and in principle His Majesty&apos;s Government have already declared their willingness to see the creation of other regional security pacts on the Locarno model as long as it was clearly understood that we did not ourselves enter into any new responsibility or commitment)  it v/as essential that this feature should be altered.      On the one hand, Prance should be prepared to give the same guarantee to Germany as it gave to Russia;      on the other hand, Russia ought to offer to Germany the same assurances of help if Germany was attacked by Prance as it v/as prepared to offer to Prance if prance was attacked by Germany-      In other words, if Russia was prepared to underwrite the Locarno Treaty, the new assurances must apply to both sides. 5. It is a measure of the importance which Pranceattaches to British approval and of the influence which we are regarded as exerting on European affairs that M. Barthou met our views on both points and expressed his willingness to modify the plan which he had first outlined to us so as to meet these objections.      In these circumstances, it seems to me   that we ought to make suitable communications to Rome, Warsaw and Berlin in favour of this modified plan. It seems extremely doubtful whether anything will come of it, for Poland is extremely luke-warm and Germany is frigid on the subject;    but the amendment to the scheme which we have insisted upon entirely removes from it the character of an anti-German alliance and we could not, I think, refuse to express our interest in a pact on so unexception-able a model as a possible contribution to greater security in Europe.6. There is, moreover, another feature which we succeeded in introducing into the definition of what is contemplated. We pressed upon M. Barthou that the scheme of an Eastern
Locarno v/as unlikely to be adopted by Germany unless there v/as associated with it some new prospect of agreement about armaments so that the pursuit of &quot;equality of rights&quot; might accompany the new development of &quot;a regime of security&quot;.    If my colleagues will consult the detailed record of our dis-cussions they will see how this point v/as developed.      Here again M.  Barthou shov/ed that he was very anxious to accommodate himself to our point of view and he agreed that the conclusion of an Eastern Locarno Pact and Germany1s inclusion in the extended system of reciprocal guarantees would afford the best grounds for the resumption of negotiations for the con-clusion of a convention about armaments with the above purpose. All this is rather vague but it appears to me to be very important both from the point of view of attempting to satisfy German claims and from the point of view of satis-fying our domestic critics that we are keeping- the problem of armaments to the forefront and are not interested merely in security questions.7. I stipulated, of course, that any conclusions at whichwe arrived v/ere merely provisional and were subject to con-sideration and approval by the Cabinet.      M. Barthou made a corresponding stipulation on his own behalf but he left us in no doubt that the French Government would approve.      Y/e recorded our provisional agreement in a document which is printed in the appendix to this note.      The document is not to be published and was drawn up merely for the purpose of securing that both sides understood the matter in the same sense.8. The question for the Cabinet now is whether they would approve our proceeding on the lines of this document.    If so, w should at once represent our view to Italy, making much of the changes in the French plan which we have obtained and which establie
the mutuality of the scheme.    M. Barthou also wishes us to &quot;be the first to communicate with Poland, where Prance has quite recently made a demarche with unfavourable results and we should of course at the same time communicate with Germany.9. The advantages of our talcing the course proposedmay &quot;be summarised as follows:-(a) We have made it entirely clear that we are not assuming any new commitments at all.      Our role is limited to recommending the modified plan to others.(b) It ma,y well &quot;be that the plan will &quot;be rejected,tut by recommending it we reaffirm Anglo-French co-operation (Monsieur Barthou has gone away extremely pleased on this point), while at the &apos; same time we entirely avoid any suspicion of Joining in the encirclement of Germany.(c) We have,  indeed, stipulated for assurances in -favour of Germany which, if they are forthcoming-, would make the Eastern Locarno plan a mutual assistance pact on the strictest lines of the Locarno model.    I think we may count upon a good deal of support, from this point of view, from those who believe that peace and disarmament depend on extending existing systems of security.(d) By our formal stipulation, marked &quot;3&quot; in the Annex, we have brought the plan into close relation with the problem of armament agreement,  and have done what we can to foster any hope that remains of a practical result at Geneva.      It is at any rate something to have got from the French a reaffirmation in terms of the  &quot;equality of rights^,  though I do not profess to see very clearly what practical consequences this may secure.
10. My colleagues will observe that Belgium is not mentioned in the annexed document, and therefore the further guarantee of Locarno is limited to France and Germany.      To the inclusion of Belgium Monsieur Barthou was definitely opposed, on the ground that Belgium could not in any circumstances lend effective aid in respect of the Eastern frontiers of Germany and. that the plan was based on cur own principle of mutuality;    and he argued that for practical purposes the Russian guarantee to France would inure to the benefit of Belgium, since the German attack on the one would involve the application of Locarno obligations in the case of the other.(inld.)    J. S.10th July, 1934o-5-
ANNEX.On the clear understanding that they do not intend as far as they are concerned to assume any new commitments in the matter of regional pacts. His Majesty&apos;s. Government would he prepared to recommend the scheme for an Eastern Mutual Guarantee pact to the German, polish and Italian Governments, provided that they are authorised to inform these Governments as follows:(l)    In the view of the French Government Russia ought to he prepared to give to Germany as well as to France the same guarantees against non-provoked aggression as those which she would he hound to give if she were a signatory of the Treaty of Locarno;(2)    In regard to the proposed Easternpact France would he prepared to give the same guarantees to both Germany and Russia.(3)    The French Government agree with His Majesty&apos;s  -Government in holding that the conclusion of such a pact and Germany&apos;s participation in the system of reciprocal guarantees now contemplated would afford the best ground for the resumption of negotiations for the con-clusion of a convention such as would provide for a reasonable applications  ion of the principle- of German equality of rights in a regime of security for all nations.
