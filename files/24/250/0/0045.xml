CONFIDENTIAL.INTER-DSPARTMSSNTAL COMMITTEE ONREPORTS OF INVESTIGATORS INTO THE DEPRESSED AREAS.SUMMARY OF INVESTIGATORS&apos; RECOMMENDATIONS AND of departmental COMMENTS THEREON.
Minister of Labour.DEPRESSED AR&amp;AS.1. The Reports^ of the Investigators -who were appointed to examine the position in certain depressed parts of the country have now been examined by the Departments concerned and by the Unemployment Assistance Bosrd.      A summary of the recommendations of the Investigators (for the sake of convenience grouped under a number of main heads) and of the observations of the appropriate Departments upon those recommendations has been prepared by an inter-Departmental Committee and is attached.2. Within the areas surveyed the Investigators found differing degrees of severe unemployment.     It is to be observed, however, that none of them would   describe any locality as &quot;derelict&quot; in the sense of being both industrially dead or moribund and at the same time so geographically isolated from   neighbouring labour markets that it would not in any circumstances be able to benefit from a recovery in neighbouring localities.     At the same time the Reports generally confirm the view, which has been held for some time, that in the areas surveyed there are substantial numbers of workpeople who, in existing conditions or indeed in any conditions which can at present be foreseen, are unlikely to obtain permanent employment in their own trades loyally except of the most casual description.     And many of them by reason of their family circumstances are unable to move.3. Within each of these areas one or more of a number of large and important industries - coal mining, iron and steel, shipbuilding and engineering are the chief - have formed a vital element in the economic and Industrial structure of the area,* Circulated to the Cabinet in accordance with Cab.  32(34) Conclusions 10.
and the prosperity of each of the areas is hound up with the fortunes of one or more of the industries named,     The present situation arises from the fact that these industries have for some years suffered from severe depression, due to Iosb of trade and, in particular, to the loss of foreign markets.     The general contraotion in international trede in recent years resulted for a time in the almost complete cessation of ship-building orders, with further reactions upon the coal-mining, iron and steel and engineering industries.4. It follows that any real remedy for the depression in these areas can only be found in a revival of trade generally and especially in an expansion of overseas trade.     An increase in world carrying trade would lead to a demand for more ships andtransport of all kinds, which would materially improve the position of the industries on which the areas under consideration rely and a revival of our export trade would go a long way to ease the situation in these areas.     In the case of South Wales, of course, a revival in the export trade in coal from that area is essential to substantial recovery.5. But, with almost every country in the world aiming at &quot;self-sufficiency&quot;, the alleviation of the conditions affecting international trade can at best be a slow process.     It must therefore be a considerable time before the depressed areas can experience substantial relief through improvements in their existing industries, while the Reports of the Investigators recognise the unlikelihood that these areas will be chosen by private enterprise for the location of &quot;new&apos;.&apos; . industries.
6.   The nain directions in which the Reports suggest that action night be taken in the meantime are:-(l) Transference, aided by training,re-conditioning, etc., and by appeals For the       ) to employers to offer vacancies toyounger       ) transferees;people.(2) Extended&apos; Juvenile Instructional Centres, fitting into Transference Scheme;(3) Land Settlement: kilotments, Bare land holdings, For those    ) Small holdings,who cannot ) Collective farms,be moved.(4) Local Occupational Devices, under the guidance of Social Service Organisations.(5) Certain Public Worxs, Roads,  etc., and Housing.The attached summary shows what has been recommended under these headings, with the Departmental comments thereon.7.   None of the policies here mentioned is new; none of them can give big results.   The situation seems one that can only be dealt with - alleviated would perhaps be a more correct word - by persistent attempts to apply a number of minor &quot;remedies11 of diverse (and perhaps changing) character. The summary shows the extent of probable action on existing lines of policy;    the Committee have recognised that what emerges is unlikely to fulfil the expectations and hopes that have been created, especially in the depressed areas themselves, by the appointment of the Investigators.H.J. -WIL9CS&amp;.2nd October,  1934.

DEPRESSED AREAS *Summary of Investigators1 Reoommendations and of the &quot; Departmental Observations tnereon&quot;I.    INTRODffOTIOH.1.   The need for special measures.   The reports oonfirm the general view that in the regions surveyed there is a large surplus of workpeople.     The trades on which those areas have depended in the past show no signs at present of reviving to an extent whioh will sufficiently relieve the position, nor Is the state of trade and employment outside those areas developing In such a way as to afford a prospect of sufficient relief from those souroes at any early date.     Adequate treatment of the problem of unemployment^ in the depressed areas must, therefore, Include the adoption of exceptional measures designed speoially to help these areas.2. Areas to which special measures should he applied. The surveys did not reveal the existence of districts with complete laok of industrial activity which oould be geographically isolated, and the investigators recommended that the measures proposed by them should apply to the whole of the regions, surveyed.     These regions do not inolude a number of areas of heavy unemployment, which have been scheduled^ by the Ministry of Labour as depressed areas.     The exact areas to which the measures finally adopted should be applied will need oareful examination and definition, but In general it is proposed that the areas to be determined for this purpose should Include the whole o&amp; the areas, surveyed by the investigators, subject to the exceptions below, together with the other areas at present soheduled.     Generally speaking it is oonsidered that the facilities should not he applied to large cit-les embraoing a variety of trades, although their rate of unemployment is high.   On the other hand, special considerations apply to juvenile problems In these cities and others like them (e.g. Liverpool) and it is reoommended, therefore, that they should not be,excluded from sohemes of juvenile transference.*A list la given in Appendix I. -4-
II .   TRANSFERENCE y TRAINING AND OOGHATE MATTERS .3.   These measures, however necessary they may be as palliatives, can only be fully effective in so far as openings in employment or some other form of occupation oan be found for the workpeople concerned.4.   The Investigators all recommend the continuance of the policy of transference ooupled with training which has been followed by successive Governments as a most important   measure for dealing with the depressed area problem.     A number of detailed recommendations are made, especially in regard to the transference of  juveniles, but as many of the suggestions deal with questions of administration and are in any case covered by the following paragraphs It has not been thought necessary to set them out in full here also.TRANSFERENOE OF ADULTS.5.   Every opportunity Is taken by the Ministry of Labour under its present powers, of transferring workers from the depressed areaB to fill suitable openings which oan be found by the Department, regard being neoessarily   paid, if the success of the transference policy Is not to be prejudiced, to the capacity of distriots outside the depressed areas to absorb workers from elsewhere without arousing hostility.     If the number of vacancies notified to the Exchanges could be substantially increased, .a larger number oould be offered to suitable workers from the depressed areas.     It Is accordingly suggested,subjeot to the provision of the neoessary funds, that an extended programme of publicity Bhould be undertaken designed to encourage employers to engage more labour through the Employment Exchange servioe. In this way the Ministry of Labour would be able to increase Its opportunities for enoouraglng transference.6.   This general   publicity programme should be accompanied by a special appeal to employers to give preference, wherever possible, to workers from the depressed areas where it is neoessary to engage
labour from beyond -dalj^ tr-avelll^g -b^sta^ce *   Employers Organisations should be invited to support the appeal.    The desirability of Introducing some general measures of compulsion, although not suggested by any of the Investigators, has been examined, but it is felt that before contemplating any such measures it would be preferable to try the effect of an appeal this kind coupled with the publicity programme mentioned above. To be effeotlve the publicity programme and the speoial appeal must both be carried out on progressive and sustained lines,7.   In addition- to the action just proposed the Ministry of Labour and the Unemployment Assistance Board suggest that consideration should be given to the question whether employers ooncerned in Government and municipal oontraots should be required to engage all their labour (other than supervisory staff) through the Employment Exchanges in those oases in whioh the financial participation of the Government gives it the power to enforce suoh a requirement, and whether Local Authorities should be urged to engage their labour in this way and to require their contractors to do likewise.The Ministry of Labour regard it as essential that the number of vacancies for depressed area men should be increased and if the proposals just made were adopted the exchanges would be assured of a considerable number of additional vacancies, a suitable proportion of whioh would be filled from the depressed areas .8.   The Unemployment Assistance Board also suggest that consideration should be given to the proposal that on all constructional works of a oertaln magnitude undertaken by Government Departments, and on all similar works, Inoluding housing and road construction, partly financed from the Exchequer,; a certain small proportion of the labour employed, should be recruited through the Employment Exchanges, from among suitable men from the depressed areas, preferably those who have been either at a training centre or instructional centre.
For decision:-(l) Increased provision for publicity for Employment Exchange facilities?(2) Appeal to Employers to give preference to men from depressed areas?(3) Government and Municipal Contractors etc. to engage labour through. Employment Jiixchanges, including men from depressed areas?9*    Transfer of women and girls to domestic employment.  The unsatisfied demand for private domestic servants offers a wide field for the transfer of women and girls from the depressed areas.      In order to aocelerate this type of transference the Ministry of Labour proposes, subject to necessary sanction, to open special offices in selected depressed areas for the purpose of bringing the opportunities available more effectively to the notice of those who might take advantage of them.     At the same time specialised Offices would be set up by the Ministry in the areas of demand.&apos;For decision:-Establishment of special Offices for transfer to Domestic Employment?1C. Financial facilities.    While there is no reason to believe that the financial facilities availaDle for assisting industrial transference of adults are in general inadequate, their scope will be reviewed and any minor anomalies and variations be adjusted, in order, as suggested by Captain Wallace, to remove all financial obstacles to the most effective prosecution of the policyvTRANSFERENCE OF JUVoiNILES.11.    There are special opportunities for juvenile transference which differentiate it from adult transference.      In spite of the exceptionally large numbers loaving sohool at the end of each term this year, there seems good reason to believe that unless there is a marked deterioration in the industrial position generally the output from the schools in the Midlands and South East of England will be readily absorbed and will
leave a considerable- number of ^vacancies which oan be filled without substantial detriment to the local Juvenile population by boys and girls from the depreBBed areas.     It is therefore recommended that the general view of all the Investigators should be aooepted and that the transference of boys and girls from the depressed areas should be continued and bo far as possible increased.12.   Fares.   Free fares should as at preuent be given to boys and girls transferred (in the case of  iris to Industrial employment only).     If&quot;does not at present seem neoessary to extend this faoility, as two of the Investigators recommend, to girls transferred to private domestic employment since in many parts of the country suoh fares are usually paid by the employers *13*   Grants in aid towards the cost of living away from homo. If the maximum amount of juvenile transference Is to be seoared, it is neoessary that in a considerable proportion of oases -especially in connection with employment offering the best permanent prospe&amp;ts - some grant should be available to make up the difference between the wage reoeived and the cost of living away from home.     The Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund, which has been &apos; used in this connection for the last six years, is exhausted. It ia reoommended that voted moneys should be used to take Its plaoe.In addition the provision and extension of hostel accommodation for boys and girls transferred to industrial employment should be encouraged as recommended by three of the Investigators.     If possible, suoh accommodation should be provided from voluntary souroes and the hostels should be run by voluntary bodieB.     The National Oounoll for Sooial Servioe should be consulted and invited to assist.In order to provide safeguards against abuse of the grant suggested above it is neoessary that, as at present:-(l) it should always oease at the age of 18j
(2) careful scrutiny should &quot;bo made to ensure that the wage paid by the employer is not below the wago paid by him to local boys or girls, and that the grant is not used to depress wage levels. 14. Hitherto any grant has had to be supplemented by the employer to the extent of at least 25$.      ThiB conaition has certain advantages and its continuance has been recommended by two flof the Investigators.      On thcs other hand It has definitely a restrictive effect on the number of vacancies obtained and the Minister of Labour is therefore considering whether in order to increase the volume of juvenile transference the view of Captain Wallace should prevail and the condition should be abolished.15. Incidental Expenses.    There are many incidental expenses connected with juvenile transference - e.g. meals on journeys, maintenance during sickness away from home or during periods of short-time working in supplementation as may be necessary of any unemployment benefit or assistance drawn by the juvenile.    It is recommended that voted moneys should continue to be available for this purpose.The Unemployment Assistance Board are aware of the difficulties mentioned in this and the preceding two paragraphs, and will be prepared to help up to the limit of their statutory powers.      The Ministry of Labour are in consultation with the Unemployment Assistance Board on the subject.16. Recolvlng Camps.      It has been suggested that receiving camps should be established in the prosperous areas.     For the present this is not recommended, but it is considered that use might be made of the hostels suggested in paragraph 13 to accommodate a number of boys brought up to the prosperous areas for personal submission to employers.      Pending employment, their expenses would have to be regarded as incidental expenses under paragraph 15.
For decisionIncreased Exchequer grant for facilities ior Juvenile    ; Transfer?    (See appendix II for details.)17. Co-operation of Local Authorities in Receiving Areap. ,-Bovs-, and girls should in general &quot;be transferred to any areas in which juvenile unemployment is small and suitable vacancies can he secured.    In many of these areas in England and wales the Local Education Authority, &quot;by virtue of Section 107 of the Education Act, 1921, is responsible under the general supervision of the Minister of Labour, for all questions regarding employment and unemployment up to the age of 18.   Many of these Authorities have in the past been very reluctant to admit boys and girls from the depressed areas, however small the number of local unemployed boys and girls, or if they have agreed to admission have only put the poorest and worst paid jobti at the disposal of the Ministry.     Their attitude in this respect has certrdrly been parochial, but in regard to their primary duty of vocational guidance for local boys and girls they generally do their work well, and to repeal the Section of the Act (as Captain Wallace suggests) would arouse the full force of educational opinion against the Government (just at a time when the Government is relying on the whole-hearted co-operation of Education Authorities to put the instructional provisions of the Unemployment Act, 1934, into effective operation) and lead to charges of broken pledges and further indifference to educational ideals.    It is therefore recommended that the Section should be allowed to stand, but that the Government should aduress to the Authorities &quot;exercising powers&quot; in the prosperous areas a strong appeal to approach the problem from a national and not a local viewpoint and to give a fair sample of their vacancies to boys and girls from the depressed areas.For decislon;-Appeal to Education Authorities? Training for adults.18.    Vocational Training.    The provision of vocational training should continue to bo related to the prospects of finding employment for the trainees.     A substantial addition to the
i   368number- of training places has% recently be-en-made.&apos; *&quot;und._furtb.erplaces (involving, if necessary, the establishment of additionalCentres) can be provided as and when the employment situationpermits.      Publicity designed to induce men in the depressed areas to accent training and to encourage employers to engage them aftertraining can be linked with the programme of publicity proposedin paragraph 0.For decision;-Two further training centres (if needed)? Cost  80,000 capital outlay. 70,000 annual expenditure.19*  Instructional Centres for Men.    The Ministry of Labour is prepared, with the co-operation of the Forestry Commission, to provide additional residential instructional centres to which volunteers from the depressed areas would be given priority of admission.    In the next 18 months it should be possible to double the existing accommodation and out-turn by providing up to 20 additional centres, each with accommodation for 200 men, giving an annual additional out-turn of approximately 16,000 men.    (At some of the new centres outside the depressed areas a proportion of the local unemployed may have to be admitted).    This programme exhau.itslands owned by the Forestry Commission, or which they have funds to purchase.For decision:-Additional residential instructional centres  ? Cost -  240,000 capital, 300,000 annual expenditure.20.    The Department of Agriculture for Scotland and theMinistry of Labour are considering a suggestion for hill drainage ,and cutting of bracken on the Department&apos;s lands leased to private tenants us a supplement or alternative to centres on ForestryEstates.21i    Married men have not in the past been encouraged to apply&apos; for admission to the Instructional Centres owing to the increased training allowances that must be paid to men separated from their
dajpendan*B.     The Unemployment A^als-tance Board will consider how far it is practicable to grant allowances to heads of families which will enable them or adult unemployed members-of the household to attend at a residential centre without hardship and so afford an opportunity for the married meja (aged up to, &amp;ay, 35) to take advantage of the Centres.22.    Occupational facilities for Men.    For the older men who are largely outside the field for possible-transference or training occupational and recreational facilities In the depressed areas, including the undertaking of amenity schemes and other schemes by voluntary labour, should be extended and developed.     The Ministry of Labour consider that additional money, without the requirement of an equivalent voluntary contribution, should be placed at the disposal of the National Council for Social ^Service-and the Scottish Council to the extent that it can be usefully spent for this purpose.Sir Arthur Rose&apos;s Report (p.3C) refers to a statement in Glasgow that a Secretariat for the co-ordination of all Community Services could probably be set up tct perform all the necessary administrative duties at a cost of approximately  2,000 par-annum. The provision of such a fund centrally would release all existing local resources for the establishment and maintenance   of centres without deduction.It is understood that at present the Scottish Council for-Community Service is in a position to obtain through the National Council of 3ocial Service sufficient funds to enable them to appoint all the central directional staff required without the-necessity for any local contribution.     They have recently appointed a full-time Secretary and are about to appoint two area officers in addition to the two existing visiting advisers.     The real diffioulty at present is not inadequacy of funds, but the fostering of a greater interest amongst the men and women whom the Council want to help.     The. Council are endeavouring to overcome
this-difficulty and if, as the result of an increased scale of operations, additional funds are required, the suggestion inthe report oan he considered, although it seems open to doubt whether departure from the voluntary principle whioh has led tothe success of the movement in favour of a paid administrative staff in charge of local centres would be desirable.For decision:-   Additional funds for National Council for social Service and for Scottish Council?23.    Other Training facilities for Adults.    On certain minorrecommendations made by the investigators which have not alreadybeen dealt with, the following observations are made:-(l)   Tho suggestion that intermediate training centres shouldbe established as a preparatory for the more intensivetraining at the existing training centres is being examined by the Ministry of Labour.(2)   The question whether any substantial result would follow from more specialised courses in domestic training forwomen is being referred to the Central Committee on Women1aTraining and Employment.Training for Juveniles.24.   So far as juveniles are concerned the provisions of theUnemployment Act, 1934, will come progressively into operationduring the coming winter, and by the spring at latest virtually all unemployed boys and girls up to the age of 18 should be in attendance at authorised courses of instruction.     These do notaim at providing training for specific occupations, but suchtraining at these courses is not considered necessary or desirable for the majority of boys and girls.     There is little evidence that the volume of juvenllo transference would be substantially increased by general vocational training for boysand girls in the depressed areas.25,    Domestic Training for Girls.    It is recommended thatthe training centres of the Central Committee for Women&apos;sTraining and Employment should continue to train girls (as well-13-
as woman) for transference to domestic employment.      In addition the new girls&apos; Junior Instruction Centres, v/hile not possessing such a definite aim, will mostly have a strong doitsstic &quot;bias, and it is anticipated that It will he possible to transfer substantial numbers of girls direct from these Centres to domestic employment.26.   Agricultural training for Boysr   An agreement has been reached with the Y.M.C.A. for giving a short training course to 300 boys a year - mainly drawn from the depressed areas - and placing them in agricultural employment at cost of  8 per boy trained and placed.     Consideration should be given by the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Agriculture to applications which are expected from other bodies possessing similar facilities for grants to assist them in placing limited numbers of boys from the depressed areas in agricultural employment.For decision:-Further grants for agricultural training for boys? Cost -  2,400 p.a.27.    VocationaliTraining of other Types for Juveniles. It is recommended that favourable consideration should be given to applications for grants from Education Authorities or voluntary organisations who propose to give training to boys and girls from the depressed areas for occupations in which there is an unsatisfied demand and into which it can be shown that such training would definitely increase the volume of transference. If the training is given out of the depressed areas, free fares to the place of training should be provided.For decision:-Grants for vocational training of Juveniles by Education Authorities or voluntary organisations?Cost -  1,000 p.a.28.   Reconditioning Camps for Juveniles. There is evidence that a number of boys available for immediate transference would be Increased if residential camps were established with the object of weaning them from their home surroundings, getting them
accus-t-omed to- living away from home, improving their physique hy good food and healthy outdoor occupations anu preparing them, for employment hy inculcating habits of discipline and self-reliance.      Only a proportion of the boys should go to such camps and attendance should be voluntary.     The camps should be run by Education Authorities or voluntary bodies with grants from the Ministry of Labour,      It might be better for the Ministry of Labour itself to do it in some places, but for this purpose legislation would be necessary.     Residence should be from four to eight weeks according to need, and there should be a rigorous combing out of those considered unfit for transference It is thought that such camps should diminish the proportion of those who now return home (about one third) largely owing to home sickness.      It would be very desirable and almost necessary to give the boys in residence some small pocket money, but legislation would be necessary If this is to be provided from voted monies.It is recommended that an experiment should be made with suchcamps on a small soale in the North East area and in South Wales,and possibly also in Lanarkshire.      Until further experience isgained it is considered that they should be limited to boys.For decision:-Re-conditioning camps for Juveniles&quot; Cost -  12,000 Capital 9,000 Annual Expenditure.Cost of .Measures Proposed..29.    It is anticipated that if all the extended schemesrecommended above were adopted, the extra cost (including theadditional staff necessary for oarrying out the schemes) wouldbe as follows:- .Capital outlay................ 337,000Current Expenditure during a full financial year ......... 536,000The details of this estimate, which is necessarily provisional and approximate only, will be found in Appendix II.
General.30.   as already atated the measures outlined in this Section involve in some cases increased expenditure on existing services. Svon if money is available to permit of the full programme the degree of success of the policy must largely depend on an expansion of ordinary industrial employment in oth^r districts. At the host these measures can only take effect over a period of years and will only deal with the younger and more active members of the unemployed communities.
III.    Development of Industrial Activity in theDepressed Areas.Proposals to this end fall under a number of heads.(l) Location of Industries,31. Captain Wallace suggests that there should he some formof national planning of industry.     The implication of thissuggestion appears to he that some authoritative body should havepower to direct where particular industries or perhaps new factories should establish themselves.      Certain remarks ofSir Wyndham portal to the effect that inhere new factories are tobe set up questions of labour supply should be considered inco-operation with some authority in the Ministry of Labour whowould be responsible for &quot;the co-ordination of labour and industry&quot;are open to the same interpretation,32. Sir wyndham Portal also makes the specific suggestion thatif possible the Board of Trade should make a special point of bringing to the notice of firms the coast line or the areas ofCardiff, Newport and Swansea.33. In fact the Ministry of Labour possesses a good deal ofinformation about the supply and quality of labour,  rates ofwages,  etc      The Board of Trade similarly possesses information on other aspects of industry, and further information (e.g.,about sites, rates, water and power supply, etc.)  can be obtainedfrom Local Authorities and Local Development Councils.      this information is available to and is sometimes made use of byprospective manufacturers;    and opportunity is taken as far aspossible of drawing the attention of the latter to the   advantagesoi the depressed areas.      Steps could be taken (for example bymeans of the publicity recommended in paragraph 5 of Section II)to bring the existence of this information to the knowledge ofprospective industrialists and to encourage the latter to make useoi it by consulting the Departments in&quot; question.
34. The Travel and Industrial-Development Association also assists in advising^ manufacturers as to the most suitable locality for their proposed factories and works in close co-operation with the Industrial Development Councils which have been established in various parts of the country.     The work of these Councils is referred to in paras.  36-7 below.35. But under existing powers industry cannot be compelled to go to a locality which the manufacturer does not consider the best for his purpose, and in the opinion of the Board of,Trade the more far reaching suggestion for what may be called the &quot;locational control of industry&quot; 7/ould require much work and much research before the controlling body possessed the necessary knowledge for giving directions as to how industry should develop; nor would the opinion when formed be likely to command universal consent.     Under such a system soa\e industrial development would be prevented unless a guarantee were given to a prospective manufacturer to compensate him for going to what he might regard as an unsuitable locality.     It seems probable, too, that the assumption of powers to settle the location of factories (except perhaps on defence grounds) would involve the State in embarrassing questions of management. The work of the Industrial Development Councils.36. Sir A. Rose and Sir wyndham Portal comment favourably on the work of the Development Councils in Scotland and South Wales. Captain &quot;Wallace refers to the attempts to form a similar Development Council for the North East Coast area and suggests that the President of the Board of Trade or Lord Londonderry should bring their influence to bear in connection with the project.37. The President of the Board of Trade has already used his influence.     When he received a deputation of North Eastern Local Authorities on the l$th March last he expressed very clearly his views on the failure of those Authorities to co-operete and his remarks were reported in the local Press.     They have failed, however, to influence the Newcastle Town Council which has refused to join in any scheme.-18-Mfcl-iran............        ..............................................................................-
(3) Formation of Development,Trusts.38. Three of the Investigators-suggest the formation of some kind of Development Trust to assist in the devolopment of the industries in the depressed areas.39. Mr. Davidsonls proposal relates to the development of agriculture and horticulture and is dealt with in the section on that subject.     He suggests that the same Trust Company-should, as a subsidiary   object, be empowered to consider and assist the development of small industries in the area,40. Captain Wallace suggests &quot;with considerable reserve&quot; the formation with Government support of a large scale organisation for the purpose of financing small industries. It is clear, however, that he envisages more than a financial undertaking, for he suggests that the new Trust might actually acquire and where necessary clear sites for development including derelict sites such as Palmer&apos;s shipbuilding yard at Jarrow.41. Sir Wyndham Portalrs proposal is on different lines. He suggests a Trust Company for financing new industries in South Wales with four or five of the largest Industrialists on it, working possibly without remuneration, with one Financier and a full time Managing Director.     They should investigate the question of all the smaller industries and local boards in the area and report on their prospects to a Central Board. Government financial assistance is not suggested. Sir Wyndham Portal further suggests the appointment of a financial adviser to investigate proposals involving credit for small industries, and to put the promoters in touch with such bodies as Credit for Industry Ltimited.42c It has been recognised for some time that there is a need for some machinery for financing those small industries or undertakings which cannot go to the money market to raisemoney and are rather outside the range of normal banking-19-
assistance.     Two companies have been formed fairly recently for this purpose.     Credit for Industry Limited.-   the more Important of the two - has received and examined a large number of applications; it advances money to sound enterprises at from 4.r% to 6% for periods from 5 to 15 years.     Normally its advances are made to established businesses, but it is not precluded from making advances to new concerns.     The Company does not anticipate any difficulty in raising as much money as necessary for these purposes.43. The Company maintains local organisations.     It has formed an Advisory Council for Scotland which examines and reports on all Scottish applications.     The formation of similar Advisory Committoes for the North of England and for South Wales is under consideration.     This local organisation appears to dispose of any necessity for the appointment of a financial adviser as proposed by Sir Wyndham Portal.44. It is suggested that the formation of a new Agency with State financial assistance would not possess any advantage.      It does not appear that the work of the existing companies is limited by financial resources and the proposed new Trust would probably either attract custom from the existing agencies owing to the better terms it could offor or would be left with the unsound schemes which the others would not touch.     It seems better to leave this business to private enterprise since the existing agencies will doubtless have imitators if they are successful,45, It should be added with reference to Captain Wallace^s suggestion that Palmer&apos;s Shipbuilding Yard at Jarrow should be acquired and cleared, that the yard has been purchased from the liquidator by Messrs. Wards the shipbreakers.     It is understood that Sir John Jarvis the High Sheriff of Surrey, who is the originator of the scheme that Surrey should adopt and assist Jarrow, is discussing with Messrs. Wards the possibility of making further use of the yard.
V&apos;        46. Captain Wallace also proposes, that in order to make the Worth East coast area more attractive for enterprises, the clearance of derelict factory sites should he undertaken either by the Government or through a Development Trust of the nature discussed in the preceding paragraphs.      So far as this proposal relates to Government action, it raises the dilemma that either the Exchequer would be financing works which would enure to the benefit of private owners, or Government would to assume responsibility for the ovmership snd ultimate disposal of such property.4) Direct Subsidisation of Industry.47. Sir Wyndham Portal suggests that the Government might offer to subsidise, for a period up to two years, the wages of unemployed men in areas where more than 50J&amp;&quot; are out of work, provided that the firm is prepared to set up a factory in one of those areas and to take on a certain percentage of the unemployed.48. Proposals for subsidising wages as a means of reducingunemployment have been made often before, and the difficulties are too well-known to require detailed comment.     Unless thesubsidy-were subject to very stringent conditions it might easily lead to the development of surplus productive capacity and to&quot; uneconomic competition in the Industri.e^-conceirned-j    andthe enforcoment of safeguards sufficient to prevent this v/culdinvolvo Governmental interference in industry to an extent which otherwise would be.neither desirable nor necessary.     The present.proposal for a short term subsidy only in districts having acertain percentage of unemployment raises additional minordifficulties.     There seems no good reason for giving a districtwith 51% unemployment advantages over one with 49^, and theextent of the area for which the percentage was to be calculated in any particular case would probably cause controversy.-21-
Moreover if it encouraged the growth of short-lived industries in particular localities, the scheme might well do more harm than good.(6) The Allocation of Government Contracts and Analogous Proposals, A number of proposals are made under this head, (a) Allocation of Government Contracts. 49. Captain Wallace suggests that, without abandoning the general principle of purchase by competitive tender, the practice of certain Departments in giving preference to depressed areas, other things being equal, should be generally followed.50. Sir Arthur Rose suggests that &quot;a designed direction of Government orders in rather larger proportions than of recent times to the Clyde area would alleviate in a remarkably wide degree, and out of proportion to what it would do in other areas, the widespread and severe conditions of depression which exist therein.&quot;51. Captain Wallace&apos;s recommendation for a general preference to the depressed areas represents the present practice of the Admiralty and War Office;    the Post Office and the Office of Works are prepared to adopt it.     The Air Ministry think that in their case the results would be infinitesimal,52. It should be pointed out, however, that the imposition of the limiting condition &quot;other things being equal&quot; must largely destroy the v value of this procedure as a means of increasing trade in the depressed areas.      On the other hand the abandonment or substantial relaxation of this condition in favour of areas of high unemployment might lead to a heavy and unjustifiable increase in expenditure, and moreover might involve serious results to some specialist firms whose continued existence is important to certain Government departments.53. The Admiralty suggest, however, that without the complete abandonment of the competitive system more might be done to assist the depressed areas by an extension of the existing
preference under vrhich &quot;buying Departments would be granteddiscretion to exercise an actual preference in price withindefined limits in appropriate cases, and to negotiate on pricewith depressed area firms where their tendered prices indicatethat this course might be fruitful.      *^hen Departments areplacing contracts of considerable magnitude they should not be precluded from submitting for consideration proposals designedto ameliorate unemployment in a particular area where this couldbe achieved without involving greater additional expense than could be faced.For declsion:-Contracting Departments to place contracts in depressed areas even if at slightly higher prices?54. Both Captain Vall3ce and Sir Arthur Rose appear to have inmind the.allocation of more contracts for Admiralty shipbuildingto the Clyde and Tyne respectively.     The Admiralty point outthat the Naval shipbuilding in progress on the Clyde and Tyneamounts in value to  6^m. and  3 m. respectively.     So long asnaval shipbuilding remains at its present level more orders canonly be given to the Clyde and Tyne either at the expense ofHis majesty&apos;s Dockyards or of shipyards in other areas notclassed as depressed.      Having regard to its effect on thetechnical efficiency of the permanent personnel of the royal dockyards and also to the vital necessity of maintaining thatpersonnel et sufficient strength to keep the Fleet ready for any emergency the Admiralty would deprecate a further reduction inthe work done in the Dockyards.     As regards giving priority todepressed over other areas the Admiralty ore not precluded from giving consideration to tenders which are not sotually the lowost,if the difference in price is small, in order to give work to areas where exceptional unemployment uxists.
55. The^Admiralty add with reference---to. Captain Wallace&apos;s suggestion that 3underaand&quot;&quot;sbauld he given special consideration, that a Sunderland firm has been invited to tender for a tender and destroyers of the 1934 programme.     The Admiralty have been able to place a certain amount of work from time to time in a number of depressed areas including Sunderland and point out that since August 1933 the North East Coafet has obtained 45$.-the Clyde 40$., and South Vales 6$i of the value of orders ( 134,000 in all) placed by the Civil Engineer in Chiefs Department.56. Sir   Wyndham Portal suggests that the Government should offer ten years firm contracts to any large producers who would undertake to produce in South Wales.57. It is difficult to see the value of this recommendation. It is doubtful if any Contractor would wish in existing conditions to be bound to a running contract for as long as ten years.      If a Contractor producing in South wales had secured his contract in the ordinary way there is no point in giving him a ten years term;    if he produces elsewhere this concession is hardly likely to induce him to go to South wales.(b) Location of Government Factories.,58. Sir Vyndham Portal suggests that a Government factory should be set up in South WaleSc    (it is understood that he has in mind the removal of Woolwich Arsenal to South Vales).59o Mr. Davidson has recommended that the Government should undertake a thorough investigation of West Cumberland from the strategic point of view and suggests that Maryport would prove an admirable site for a seaplane factory and base.60. These recommendations must clearly be related to the claims of all the depressed areas.61. The Admiralty have pointed out that there is at present no prospect of reopening either Pembroke Dock or Rosyth Dockyard.
They have-however^^mmenc^&apos;&apos;the--con8truc-tion. of a Mining Depot at Milford Haven at an estimated cost of  384,000.      The numbers employed on the site will probably fluctuate between 250 and 400 over s period of three years.      The number of the total permanent staff to be employed after the Depot is completed will probably not exceed 150.62. The question of the location of the Royal Ordnance Factories et Woolwich, Waltham, Bnfield, etc., is at present under consideration by a Committee under the Chairmanship of the Financial Secretary to the 7/ar Office.     Similarly the question of the location of Aircraft   factories is being examined by a Committee of the Air Ministry.63. The recommendations of the Investigators under this head have been brought to the notice of the Departments in question; and assurances have been received that in examining the problems set before them the Committees just mentioned will bear in mind the needs of the depressed areas.(6) Railway Rates in Cumberland.64. Mr. Davidson has called attention to alleged excessive and differentiated freight rates and inadequate railway services, as obstacles to industrial prosperity and development in West Cumberland,      He has recommended that these matters should be looked into without delay.65. The Ministry of Transport have no record of any complaint of excessive or differentiated railway freight or inadequate services relating specifically to the Cumberland area, and the Railway Rates Tribunal have received no application for a reduction of freight rates in the area-66r Indeed as the result of an undertaking given by the Railway Companies to the Mining Association, Cumberland collieries and traders continue to enjoy pre-amalgamation
privileges which are not in operation in other districts served hy the L.M.S., e.g.  (l) a lower charge per ton for hire of railway owned wagons (2) low minimum rates for short distance traffic,67. The only example given in support of the complaint of differentiated charges was certain alleged rat&quot;&apos; for coal to Carlisle Gas Works from Scottish and Whitehaven Collieries respectively.      The information given to Mr. Davidson was, however, incorrect, the rates are not as stated to him and those from the nearest Scottish Collieries to the Gas Works are in fact considerably in excess of the Whitehave rate. (7) Proposed Beet Sugar Factory in Pembrokeshire.,60. Reference is made in Sir Wyndham Portal&apos;s report to the possibility of establishing a beet sugar factory at Pembroke Dook in order to relieve the unemployment in that area,69. The Ministry of Agriculture understands that Mr. Beaoon of the Lincolnshire Sugar Company has examined this question and discussed it with the Pembroke Borough Council,70. There do not appear to be any technical difficulties in the way;    the land in Pembrokeshire is suitable and the yield is high compared with the rest of the country.      The area planted to sugar beet this year was slightly over 3,000 acres.      The requisite j amount of land for a moderate-sized factory (10,000 to 12,000 acres)  could no doubt be made available either in Pembrokeshire^ or on the borders of the neighbouring counties but it is impossible to say whether the additional land would give the high yields of the existing area.     A certain amount of employment would be provided, mainly on a seasonal basis - 600 men at the factory for three months and, including the labour already employed in the present beet area, from 800 to 1,000 men in the fields for 14 weeks.      The consumption of coal would be about 15,000 tons and of limestone about 4,800 tons, in each case much below the estimates in Sir Wyndham&apos;s report.
71. The future of the iixdustry- Ils so usacertain&apos; that. It Is unlikely t hat either outside promoters or existing-; cxgicexns-r . or even the industry as a whole, would he prepared at this stage to embark upon the raising of the necessary capital of  350,000 -  400,000.72. A Committee under Mr. Wilfrid Greene which is enquiring into the sugar industry, including the whole question of the continuance of the beet sugar subsidy, will no doubt also consider the establishment of new factories and the desirability of transferring existing factories to more suitable sites.     But its report is not expected until the middle of November.     The Gommittee has been furnished with an extract from Sir Wyndham Portal&apos;s report on the proposed beet sugar factory in Pembrokeshire. (8) Co-operation of Local Authorities.73. Sir Arthur Pose pleads for the greater co-operation of Local Authorities in attracting new industries to the depressed areas and cite? as an example of the lack of that co-operation the refusal by the Corporation of Glasgow of an offer by Messrs, Wm. Baird and Company to supply the City with coke oven gas, with a guarantee of continuity of supply at a fixed price over a period of years.74. The Company desire to modernise their coke ovens at Coatbridge in order to be in a better position to compete in the iron ore market.      It appears the scheme can only be eoonomic if they are assured of a stable market (which could be most conveniently supplied by the City of Glasgow) for the resultant gas.     The advantages claimed for the scheme include the capital outlay on new plant of about  500,000 and increased consumption of 9oal, iron ore and limestone, resulting in a considerable increased volume of employment which is put by Sir Arthur xiose at 2,500 to 3,000 men in various capacities exclusive apparently of employment arising out of expenditure on the new plant.
75, This matter was referred to in a reply given to a Parliamentary Question hy the President of the Board of Trade on the 19th June^ 1954, hut no Government Department has any power to intervene.      The offer was rejected hy the Corpora^ r..o:i hy 51 votes to 47 on 7th June, 1934.      The statement mado xn Sir Arthur Rose&apos;s Report that Glasgow is practically the on^y large City associated with the iron industry which makes no use of coke oven gas, is not homo out hy the information available in the IWineo Department,,      Lost year, according to official returns, it used nearly .2,000fCOO cubic foet of coke oven gas per day-75. The decision of the Corporation to reject the offer was reached, as indicated above, by a narrow majority (51 to 47) and it has been the subject of discussion in the press and elsewhere.      It is understood that the majority expressed apprehension about the continuity of supply and maintained that the Corporation would have to keep the existing plant in working order to provide against emergency.      It has also been suggested in the press that the labour members of the Corporation voted against the proposal on purely political grounds. (9) Influence, of High Rates,77. Three of the Investigators refer to the relation between high rates and the establishment of new industries in their areas.      Captain Wallace suggests and Sir Wyndham Portal comes to the definite conclusion that high local rates have acted as &amp; deterrent to new industrial development in the North Bast of England and South Wales respectively.     By way of contrast Sir Arthur Rose states of Scotland that tho previously existing handicap of high local rates has been largely mitigated by the Deruting Act.78. It is at leost doubtful if there is in existing conditions much substance in the complaints voiced by CaptainWallace and Sir Wyndham Portal.      It Is true that rates are-28-
high, but in South Wales at any rate this has always been so.In any case rotes form a very small item in the costB ofproduction especially now with the derating provisions of theLocal Government Act 1929 in force.      Sir Arthur Roso&apos;s reading of the situation seems much more likely to be true on the whole.79. Although not strictly relevant to the question of new industries it may be convenient to mention here a complaint madeby Mr. Bvan Williams and reported by Sir Wyndham Portal thatcollieries are rated much higher than other industries.     no evidence was offered on this question.     The position is thatcollieries are assessed in the main on output and complaints of excessive assessments of collieries practically ceased on thederating of industry.      The sums payable as rates are relatively small, amounting In the first quarter of 1934 to only lid, out3of a selling price of 14s.ll^d. per ton.
IV.    AGRICULTURE (1)    ALLOTMENTS IK ENGLAND AND WALES80. As distinct from Sir Arthur Rose&apos;s report as regards Scotland, kr. Davidson and   Captain Vallace make no specific recommendations with regard to allotments, except that Captain Wallace reports that if it were practicable to supply every unemployed man with an allotment he would recommend this as restoringTils moral and physical health.    Captain Wallace points out, buowever, that although it might be practicable to furnish a very large percentage of the unemployed In the mining villages of Durham County with land upon which to work, this is not the case in built-up areas.    Sir V/yndham Portal commends the work being done in providing allotments in South Wales, and records the fact that in only- one or two cases did he find that difficulty had been experienced In obtaining land.81. The provision of land for allotments in England and Wales rests with Local Authorities (i.e. Borough, Urban District and Parish Councils), and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries loses no opportunity of stimulating these authorities to action where an unsatisfied demand exists and where there is land available.   There is no general provision in force for State assistance to Local Authorities in regard to the provision of land for allotments in England and Wales, out following on a decision In May, 1933, the Treasury will be prepared, if a Local Authority in a depressed area expressed its unwillingness to acquire land for allotments for unemployed persons because of the rate burden involved, to consider representa-tions by the Ministry that Financial assistances,from the Exchequer should be provided.    The Treasury were unwilling to authorise any general announcement of this decision, which was therefore communicated by the Ministry to the
Society of Friends Allotment Gardens for the Unemployed Committee, and to the National Council of Social Service. So far no applications have, however, been received.82.    The scheme administered by the Society of Friends for assisting unemployed men and partially employed men to purchase seeds, fertilisers and. implements required to cultivate allotments received financial support from the Government.    In the cropping season of 1934 a total of 117,522 men were assisted, of whom 22,149 resided in the north-oast area of Northumberland, Durham and Cleveland, 23,318 in the South Wales area, and 695 in Cumberland. This scheme will be continued for the cropping season of 1935.(2)    SMAIA,HOIfPINGS AMP LAND SSTTLjafctNT IN ENGLAND AND WALES -03.    All three Investigators refer to the question of land settlement and urge the desirability of settling unemployed workers on the land.      Their proposals for carrying this policy into effect display considerable differences.84.    Sir Wyndham Portal recognises that it is not possible to find sufficient land in the neighbourhood of the man&apos;s dwellings in the depressed areas of S. Wales and he proposes that they should be moved from their homes and settled in oo-operative colonies in the Vale of Glamorgan or Monmouthshire.    The men should be given a year&apos;s training (including those men who had formerly worked on the land) and should receive some monetary allowance or unemployment pay during the first year on their small holding.    No suggestion is made regarding the size of the holding.85.    Captain Wallace recommends that a scheme on the lines of that at present in operation in Durham
County should be financed by the Exchequer.     Under such a scheire men would first of all be trained in small groups of 20 on 5-acre centres run on a communal basis;    selected nan ^ould subsequently be drafted in groups of 4 to 20-aore holdings with a view to their supporting themselves. Unemployment pay should be available to the men in training and should be continusd to those on the larger holdings until the land is in full production.     The working capital (estimated at  9.5 per man on the small plots and at  150 per man on the larger holdings) should be provided by the Exchequer;  although the men provided with larger holdings would be expected to repay two-thirds.     The Exchequer should bear the main portion - a sum in excess of 75 per cent. - of the loss arising out of the acquisition and re-letting of the land.86. for.Davidson while pressing strongly for a policy of land settlement in Cumberland does not favour the Individual type of small holding, which, he considers, is costly and of which, he says; the success is doubtful. He suggests large scale&quot;business&quot;land cultivation undertaken by a Development Trust Company with a State Guarantee of part of the interest on the money raised.     Cultivation would be aimed at the production of soft fruit and tha development of market gardening coupled with poultry and pig-keeping.     The man, who would undergo a period of training during which they should draw unemployment benefit or assistance, would be employed persons residing in their own homes and working under skilled supervision. In addition each man would have a subs1stance holding, Marketing of the produce would be undertaken by a special staff for the purpose.     A number of such schemes should be started throughout the area and linked together.
87- Co-operative Colonies^   The Ministry of Agriculture confirms the view expressed hy Sir Wyndham Portal that a considerable number of unemployed men in South Wales would not be placed on the land without moving them from their present;   ;.liomeso    It is probable, however, that a sufficient number of men could be selected, who,after a period of training,would be willing and suitable to be transferred to small holdings established as near as practicable to their existing homes. Some of the financial e stimates provided in Sir Wyndhnm Portal5 s Report cannot be accepted,.    For example,  it is estimated that the working capital required for a holding of the market garden type, in addition to the cost of the dwelling house, would be about  170 as compared with  50 mentioned in the Report.    The provision of small holding colonies of the type suggested would involve considerable capital expenditure (for land, house and equipment) which, presumably, would have to be defrayed by the Exchequer and provision would also have to be made for the cost of training and the maintenance of the men during the early period previous to the time when they would become self-supporting.88. Captain Wallace emphasises that the method which he proposes would not involve immediate settlement on a large scale and it seems obvious that the contribution it will make to the unemployment problem in the area would be small and delayed.    It seems likely that support by way of unemployment assistance would be necessary for at least 4 years   so that it would be some time before the State received, by way of reduction in unemployment assistance, any return for expenditure incurred on the scheme.    This expenditure would include the cost of acquiring the necessary land if it is to be purchased.    If, as is apparently intended, the men are to devote themselves to poultry keeping, it is considered that
the  150 per nan quoted by Captain Wallace as the necessaryworking capital would not be sufficient to enable a man tobecome self-supporting on his 4 or 5 acre holding at the endof his first year.89. Regarded as an occupational scheme for maintaining the morale of the men, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheriesconsider that the scheme suggested by Captain Wallace would beof considerable benefit even to those men who never get beyondthe initial stages.    But existing experiments have not yetproceeded far enough to say whether it will result in asubstantial proportion of the men trained succeeding in makinga livelihood when transferred to the 4 or 5 acre holdings.For decision:-Should co-operative colonies of small holdings be established (for men selected ^after period of training)?90D Canning Factories.    Captain Wallace further suggeststhat the possibility of establishing canning factories onTyneside should be investigated at once.    The establishment offurther canning factories, however, is not expected for sometime, as existing factories, and especially those engaged inthe canning of vegetables, are working to less than their full capacity.91* Large scale Farms.    The Ministry is not in a position to express any definite opinion as to whether the Development Company recommended by Mr. Davidson would be able to raise from private sources the capital required.    It seems unlikely that any considerable sums of money would be forthcoming from agriculturists for this purpose, but possibly a certain amount of private capital could be raised.    It is obvious that if the capital required can be secured from private sources for a scheme of this kind, thereby ensuring management by those interested in preserving the capital, there is much to be said
for encouraging an experiment on the lines advocated by Mr. Davidson, especially as it provides an alterrative form of land settlement for unemployed persons which does not necessitate the provision of working capital for individual small-holders.    If, however, it were found impracticable to raise the necessary capital without a Government guarantee, the scheme would be fundamentally changed.    The Ministry is of opinion that the annual cost of settling men on a large farm managed on behalf of the Government, or with a Government guarantee of capital and interest, would exceed the cost of settling the same number of men in small holdings.* Action:Further enquiry as to possibility of raising capital for large scale &quot;business&quot; land cultivation.92. Small Holdings.    In contra distinction to the positionin Scotland, which is dealt with later (paras. 123-8), theGovernment is not in a position at the present time toprovide small holdings in England and Wales by direct action,the relevant provisions of the Agricultural Land (Utilisation)Act, 1931, being in abeyance.   A scheme somewhat analogous ...to that being administered &quot;by the Department of agriculture for Scotland in regard to the provision of holdings of 5-9acres is, however, administered in England and Wales by county Councils and Councils of County Boroughs under the*Since the War the Ministry has itself farmed considerable areas of land under the Small Holdings (Colonies) Acts, mainly for the purpose of providing employment for ex-service men.    These farms proved extremely costly and the last one was closed down at Michaelmas 1934.    On this particular farm in Wiltshire, the total loss on the Farm Trading Account amounted on 31st March, 1934, to  26,533c The net loss for the year 1932-3 was  3,627 or  103 per man employed and for the year 1933-4  2,235 or  70 per man employed.    These losses greatly exceed the annual loss on small holdings provided by the Ministry.
tJ D or small Holdings-Acts, the Ministryof-AgxiculJnire-^ontrilrui; 75 per cent, of any annual deficiency on the scheme. Recently the Ministry has taken steps to encourage Councils to provide in.suitable districts holdings of a small area which, by intensive methods of cultivation, may yet provide a full livelihood to the occupiers.    The Lancashire County Council has been the pioneer in establishing holdings of bhis type, and while is is true that the local circumstances in Lancashire may be particularly favourable, it is believed that there are a number of other Counties in which similar holdings might be established with real prospects of success.Out of 29 2 holdings provided by County Councils since May 1933, of which the Ministry has particulars, 158 holdings are of the smaller type which has been describedc   There are, however, no statutory powers for the provision of holdings for unemployed   men not possessing the necessary working capital, except those comprised in the Agricultural Land (utilisation) Act, 1931, which has not yet been put into operation for reasons of economy.    The holdings provided by Councils are available for suitable men, whether employed or unemployed, but as they r-ust possess sufficient working capital or be able to provide themselves with such capital,it is not to be expected that the scheme could materially relieve the problem of unemployed men from the depressed areas.For decjsion;-Should the Agricultural Land (Utilisation) Act, 1931, be put into force, enabling the provision of holdings for unemployed men not possessing working capital?93. Bare Land Holdings.   Allotment authorities in England and Vales have power to provide allotments up to 5 acres, but as regards borough  .or urban districts with a population-36-
of ten thousand or- upwards, there is no obligation to provide other than allotment gardens not exceeding 20 poles in extent.    In practice, urban allotment authorities rarely provide anything but allotment- gardens, usually of about 10 poles, sufficient to enable a man to grow vegetables for consumption by himself and his family, but out of subscriptions-tions received the Society of Friends Allotments Committee allocated  16,941 in 1953 for the provision of larger allotments and small holdings for unemployed men.94. County Councils in England and Vales are also empowered to provide bare land holdings for applicants whether employed or unemployed provided they have sufficient knowledge to cultivate the land properly and,  in addition, are able to provide themselves wi th the working capital required.    The Ministry repays County Councils rr&apos;5yi of the annual loss incurred.    These holdings, unless they provide the occupier with a complete livelihood, i.ee  something for sale over and above what the man and his family consume, are not suitable for men permanently unemployed (even if they have the necessary knowledge and capital) unless they are permitted to continue to draw unemployment assistance or Poor Relief.    The creation of a considerable number of bare land holdings for men permanently in receipt of public assistance, placing them in competition with other suppliers not in receipt of sUeha ssistanee,  clearly raises animportant and difficult question of public pc]j..cy not differing in principle from the proposal to pay unemployment benefit in aid of wages.For docision:-Should bare land holdings be developed despite the difficulty of granting permanent public assistance?
95v Land Settlement Association.^- In.,-April. 1934, following on a deputation received by the Prime-sMJwi atej-on the 26th October, 1933, the Treasury agreed to the constitution of an Association for England and Wales for the purpose of carrying out an experimental scheme for the provision of small holdings for intensive cultivation by , unemployed persons and the provision of preliminary training for prospective holders.    It was agreed that the State should contribute up to  50,000 per annum over a period of three years on the basis of  1 for every  2 raised by way of gift from non-State sources, the Association to be representative of contributors and participating organisations such as the Society of Friends and the Carnegie Trustees.    It was further provided that the Government should not be represented on the Association but should rely on the scheme being launched under suitable direction, advisory assistance to be freely available and a liaison officer representing the Ministry of Agriculture to be appointed*96. The Association, of which Sir Percy Jackson is the Chairman, has held two meetings and has drawn up rules for its constitution, and is about to advertise for a Chief Executive Officer.   The Association have agreed, in principle, to two lines of action:-(1) The provision of bare land   holdings for small groups of men on the outskirts of industrialtowns principally in depressed areas. (2) Establishment of three or at the most fourcolonies in various parts of the countryto which men would be moved.
But no defindte-^decisions have beeiua reived at untilconcrete schemes have been submitted to the Associationfor consideration.97c Unfortunately, the work of the Association will benecessarily limited if the subscriptions obtained are onlysufficient to earn the maximum Exchequer grant, as in thesecircumstances the sum of  150,000 only will be availableeach year for the work of the Association.    In thisconnection, it may be mentioned that strong representations were made by various members of the Association that theExchequer grant was inadequate and that the basis of  1 for 2 would be unlikely to attract public subscriptions.   as already stated, however, the Association decided to acceptthe conditions laid down by the Treasury, and as soon asthey definitely settle the lines on which to proceed theywill doubtless issue an appeal for public subscriptions.The Association is a very representative body, and agreater measure of financial assistance from the state would doubtless strengthen its appeal to privatesubscribers, and might render it a suitable organisationthrough which approved experimental schemes of landsettlement might well be conducted especially in or onbehalf of the depressed areas   in England and wales.For decision:Should Sir Percy Jackson&apos;s Association be provided with increased Exchequer grant and urged at once to concentrate its efforts on the depressed areas?98. General.    The Ministry of Agriculture point outthat in general, the proposals of the Investigators asregards land settlement do not appear to offer an aappreciable contribution to the solution of the unemployment
problem.    In any case, proposals involving an increase in the production of agricultural commodities in this country would need careful examination in the light of the Government&apos;s general agricultural policy.    In this connection,  it must be remembered that the great increase which has occurred in recent years in various branches of agricultural production has already created problems which are Causing the Government considerable anxiety.    For example,  the total production of eggs in England and Wales in 1924-5 was 1,957 millions. In 1933-1 this production had increased to 3,852 millions, or nearly double the 1924-5 figure.    Similarly,  in the case of milk.    In 1924-5,  the total production of milk,  excluding that fed to stock,  was 1,117 million gallons.    By 1931 it had increased to 1,263 million gallons, or 13;., and by 1933-4 milk production had risen to 1.378 million gallons, no less than 23;&quot;^ increase on the 1924-5 level.99.    The Government have for some time been giving careful consideration to the possibility of further expansion in the future of home agricultural production,  recognising that this v/ill involve a reduction in imports of food stuffs from overseas.    In this connection, estimates have been under discussion based on a theoretical figure of an additional 100,000 men employed in agriculture in the United Kingdom. A scheme of this magnitude raises questions of policy which go far beyond the scope of the present document.    At the same time,  it will be realised that an expansion of the agricultural industry on this scale v/ould undoubtedly provide opportunities for increased employment within the four areas which form the subject of the Investigators&apos; Reports,  as well as opportunities for transfer to employmentvoutside those areas.
i Land Drainage (England and Wales).100.  Sir Wyndham portal recommends that river drainage and the setting up of catchment boards should be encouraged.101. Captain Euan Wallace recommends that financial assistance should be given to the Durham County Council to enable it to carry out a number of open Drainage works.102. Mr. Davidson refers (Appendix VII to his Report) to catchment area drainage and states that existing powers^ and facilities are adequate and that the employment value of any such schemes is small.103. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries has supplied the following statement e xplanatory of the present position.104. The Land Drainage Act,  193Q, required the constitution of 47 Catchment Boards for rivers set out in a schedule to the Act, which were the rivers most urgently in need of attention. The Act also prescribed procedure for setting up further Catchment Boards as required.   Two further Catchment Boards have been so set up.105.   It will be understood, however, that the procedure involved in setting up new Catchment Boards is rendered difficult where the proposed area includes County Boroughs who uBually, on account of their high rateable value, would have to find a large portion of the expenses of the Catchment Board.   Although the Minister of Agriculture could create new Catchment Boards on his own initiative, he would find it   . undesirable to do so, unless with the assent of all the Authorities concerned.    Otherwise the necessary Order ifobjected to would ^have to be taken to parliament,  where it might be opposed.106. Under the 1930 Act, Catchment Boards are entitled to apply for Government grants towards work of certain kinds, and as these Boards are now responsible for the major waterways in this country, the Minister would regard it a retrograde step to revert tot he system of making grants    to the several hundredlesser drainage boards (dealing with internal drainage) andIto the County Councils, as was the practice between 1921 and 1931, before the 1930 Act produced the larger Catchment Boards.
107. A prsli nonary scheme- sulDmiirt^-^by-the kid--GJaBuxrgan Rivers Catchment Board has already been approved for a Government grant, and further schemes involving an expendiJburri of as much as  50,000 are understood to be in preparation and -will in due course be submitted for grants.108. The proposed formation of a Catchment Board in connec-tion with the River Tawe which passes out into the Bristol Channel at Swansea and which has given rice, in the neighbour-hood of Pontardawe, to frequent and serious flooding, raises the above-mentioned difficulty, namely, that the County Borough of Svansea (which would reap perhaps little benefit) is naturally unwilling to find a, largo proportion of the expenditure.   Nevertheless the project for the constitution of a Catchment Board is understood to be still under considera-tion locally.    A Catchment Board for the River Ely - the only other possible area in South Wales - would also probably be opposed- by Cardiff for the same reasons.109c Similarly in Durham it has so far been found impossible to set up a   Catchment Board for the rivers of the County since the proposed area would include one or more County Boroughs whose co-operation, it is feared, would not be forthcoming. This is unfortunate as there is still a great deal of drainage work to be done in the county of a type on which mainly hand-labour would be employed, so that it would give a good deal of employment relative to the expenditure involved.110. As regards Cumberland, proposals were discussed some time ago for the formation of a Catchment Board for the River Eden, and the matter is understood to be slowly progressing.    The County Borough of Carlisle in this case seem to be disposed to co-operate. For decision:Should we depart from the 1930/31 settlement, which provides for the constitution of Catchment Boards, and revert to the system of making grants to lesser drainage boards?-42-
111. It 13 necessary to add in regard to proposals for grants in aid of drainage-schemes generally that, in the view of the Ministry of Health, a case can he made out for grant for^other-public works of equal advantage.    The same Departmeirtr point out that Drainage schemes designed to carry water with the utmost rapidity to the sea may be bad for water supplies, and that all flooding is not necessarily an evil.(4) -AGRICULTURE (SCOTLAND). 112. Sir Arthur Rose states that purely relief works are at present outside the Government&apos;s intention and in this view he concurs generally, but he believes there are districts in Scotland (one or two in Lanarkshire have been carefully surveyed) where it might be possible at a reasonable cost per acre to reclaim land and make it suitable for the smaller type of small holding possibly for 5 to 2 acre plots.   He further believes there is still room for^a considerable measure of land drainage work.   He suggests therefore that the Department of Agriculture for Scotland be asked to indicate how far in their view such schemes would provide a measure of alleviation of the problem.113. The observations of the Department of Agriculture for Scotland fall under four main headings, (a) Land Reclamation.114. The area in Lanarkshire referred to in the Report falls within the scope of certain reclamation proposals affecting Midlothian and Lanarkshire, which have been oonsidered in the past in considerable detail, aiming at the   reclamation of certain rough pasture and peat moorland for the establishment of small dairy farms.   A special re-examination of these proposals in 1930 produced a scheme for reclaiming 10,000 acres into 100 acre holdings at a cost of  280,000;    it would provide 800 to 1,000 men with work for the first year, but fewer for the second.    The scheme however was not implemented.-43-
115. The reclamation work in itself would only &quot;be a temporary relief work and such works are considered hy the Report to he undesirable.    The justification of the work accordingly would depend upon the holdings to he formed on the reclaimed ground and the prospects of their success. Reclamation would not produce land suitable for close settlement of the kind at present being undertaken in the industrial belt in Scotland,   At best, a number of small dairy farms would be formed on the reclaimed land and for these it would prcbably be difficult to secure suitable tenants who could undertake the difficult   farming required.    Moreover the cost would be heavy as compared with the results which could be achieved by expenditure on a normal land settlement schemec    It is estimated that on a unit of expenditure of  6,000 the reclamation soheme would provide one small farm of 100 acres as against seven or eight small holdings on a normal land settlement scheme. (*0 Land Improvement.116. Sir Arthur Rose suggests   that land improvement, particularly in regard to drainage, might provide an opening for employment; that there is a great deal of land particularly sheep grazing&apos;;  land in the Highlands needing draining, but that the amount of land being drained seems to be diminishing because of a progressive reduction in the proportion of cost contributed by the Government.117. It is true that the rate of grant for drainage schemes has been progressively reduced.   A restoration of the pre-existing rates of Government Grant would result in a greater number of applications for assistance with an increase in employment.    This would be reflected more or less uniformly over the whole country and while benefiting the depressed areas would not do so exclusively.
til?118. A snail scheme for the employment of minors on drainage work was administered in 1929, offering a considerably higher rate of grant if half of the labour required were obtained from the depressed areas.   Very limited advantage wus taken of the facilities offered and nearly half of the schemes which were approved were abandoned, and in a number of bases the miners ceased work and returned home in a few days.    In a few cases the farraer-applicants were entirely satisfied.   But the expectation that a number of depressed area men would find a permanent place in rural industry, in the main remained unrealised.   Agricultural drainage is arduous work carried out often in adverse conditions of weather, and in remote parts; and farmers conservative by nature, prefer to use the floating pool of local workmen rather than strange and inexperienced labour.119. The Department of Health for Scotland and the Ministry of Labour are considering for inclusion in their training and reconditioning schemes,the erection of temporary camps on the Department&apos;s or other Highland Estates where useful work might be done in hill drainage, and bracken cutting.    There would be difficulties not easy of solution owing to the remoteness of the areas where the work would be performed, but the practicability of the proposal is being examined.  (See paras. 19-21).120. While the Report refers solely to agricultural drainage it is pointed out that the Department is the general Land Drainage Authority for Scotland.   The Departments activities, however, have been restricted to a very limited scale owing to the financial stringency.    There are a number cf schemes of arterial drainage, mainly in the depressed areas but suitable for men from those areas, which could well be pursued given the necessary financial s auction.    Several schemes are to hand the total capital cost of which is about
 56,000, of which more than  18,000 would he recoverable from landowners whose lands had benefited from the work, and the employment estimate of which is 3,670 man months. For decision should exchequer money be provided for arterial drainage?Cost -  56,000 for Schemes to hand In Scotland.(a) Allotments.121. The Report praises highly the allotment schemes carried on by the Joint Committee of the National Union of Allotment Holders and the Society of Friends.     Attention, however, is called to certain (unspecified) burghs where an unsatisfied demand for allotments exists owing to difficulty in obtaining land.122. The great majority of the allotment holders aided by the Committee are in the areas dealt with by the Report.      The Department, however, have not been informed by the Joint Committee of difficulty in obtaining land in places other than Glasgow. They are ready to assist the Joint Committee in any case of this kind thst may arise, snd h?ve the power to do so by making an order enabling a Local Authority to acquire land compulsorily for allotments.      The Department have in many esses assisted Local Authorities and Allotment Associations by making grants for equipment.(d) Smell Holdings and plots.123. The Department are at present in the initial stages of developing a programme of land settlement to be spread out over this and the next two years.     Recently the Department from the normal funds placed at their disposal for land settlement purposes, have experimented with the formation of small-sized holdings for intensive cultivation near large consuming centres.     This experiment has proved successful and Parliament has recently provided an augmentat!on of funds for the purpose.      It is proposed to spend in all some  800,000 and to establish about 1,000 holdings of from 5 to 9 acres near the
consuming centres in the industrial belts, assigned for the intensive production of poultry products, pigs, market garden, and glass-house produce etc.      They are to be equipped v/ith houses and steadings and are let on ordinary agricultural tenure at reasonable rents,    The equipment provided is not &quot;lavish1 as suggested in the Report, but is minimum, much being left to the holder to provide.    In selecting holders, suitable men from urban industrial areas, in employment or unemployed, are favourably considered; these men, however, require to have the experience and ability necessary for the management of a holding and sufficient capital to work the holding and carry on until returns come in.  The necessity for this type of holding being near large consuming centres means that operations will be largely in the industrial belt which covers all the distressed areas in Scotland, 124. For those men, unemployed or partly employed, without capital, but with the will to work, the Department have put into operation the experimental scheme for the provision of plots confidently recommended in the Report.    Nearly 1,000 plots have been provided, The size of the plots varies in the main from one quarter of an acre to one acre, and provide more extensive and varied activities than are possible on an allotment-garden. The rents charged are calculated to do no more than recoup the Department for their outlay while not imposing too heavy a burden on the tenantsj  The Department assist the tenants with small loans for the purchase of equipmentj and relieve them of rent charge and loan repayment during the first year. The Department have specially aimed at obtaining land for plots adjoining villages where unemployment exists, as practical considerations, chiefly the distance of the men&apos;s homes from available land, have limited the introduction of the scheme near the larger towns,
125. The scheme lias been mai*ke\lly:&quot;^kvc^ssTvlL in achieving its object of rest-oring umemployed men from a condition of hopelessness to one of physical and mental well being.   Authority has been obtained to continue the scheme for another year in order that it may be kept alive on its present basis until the Unemployment Assistance Board, have had the opportunity of considering whether they can undertake any part in the administration of the scheme with or without modification.      The gross initial cost of providing the plots is about  7.10.0 per holder, and on repayment of the equipment loans the net cost per holder is about  6.      Individual successes are striking but it is not to be expected that all of the.men cn these plots have the ability or the will to accumulate capital sufficient to jillow them to undertake full time small holdings.126. With regard to the recommendation that the Ministry of Labour reconditioning centres might prove useful training schools for plot-holders, it is suggested that there is a danger in training a large number of men unless they can subsequently be placed.     Before securing land, the department ascertain the demand for plots, and this demand is made generally by men who have the will to work.     The plots form a testing ground where the unsatisfactory are weeded out.     The plot-holders learn from each other and are advised generally by the Departments Land Officers and the Instructors on the Staffs of the Agricultural Colleges.127.The Department have frequently found it difficult to obtain land where a demand for land for unemployed iren exists., and it is suggested that the ftscretary of State might take an opportunity to invite landlords and tenants out of public spirit to make land available for these plots on terms enabling the Department to rent the plots to the men at moderate rateso128. The Report refers to villages where the residents in the absence of industrial employment would prefer to remain in their
present situation and develop agricultural pursuits.     It is probably impossible to make a small holdings scheme an integral part of a housing scheme;   but if land suitable for small holdings and/or plots can be obtained in proximity to the housing scheme, it would be practicable to offer holdings or plots to such occupiers in rehousing schemes as are, by their possession of capital and experience, considered qualified.     Endeavours will continue to be made to obtain land in the vicinity of rehousing schemes, but it would probably tend to enhance prices against the Department if it were announced that it would be the general policy of the Department to acquire land for the special purpose of attaching small holdings or plots to the Local Authorities rehousing Schemes.
V.   Afforestation.(1)    South Wales.129. Sir Wyndham Portal recommends that H.M. Government should ask the Forestry-Commission to prepare a scheme for this area, and, if after investigation,  they consider it practical they should give an extra grant through the Forestry Commission.130. This recommendation has been considered by the Forestry Commission who already have a number of estates in South Wales. They do not feel that it is practicable, having regard to all the factors which must be taken into account, to produce a large scheme on an economical basis for South Wales; they think that if money for such a scheme were    available it would be spent to much better advantage elsewhere.   At the same time the local officers of the Forestry Commission are always actively on the look out for any available land suitable for planting, and they are always prepared to consider any scheme put before them locally.    They are at present investigating a scheme proposed to them by the pontardawe Kural District Council.(2)   Cumberlan d.131. Mr. Davidson recommends that afforestation schemes should be developed.    If new afforestation schemes could be started on such a scale as to justify training centres like Kershopefoot and Kielder they would be of definite advantage.132.  In general the considerations mentioned under South Wales apply here.    The Forestry Commission state that it is difficult to get suitable planting land near Cumberland. They have in view two acquisitions on a large scale in Northumberland, but point out that such large purchases would throw out of gear their general acquisition policy of adding where possible to existing units.   Under their present programme  43,000 a year is available for purchases, a sum which would scarcely pay for the acquisition of one of the large areas in view in Northumberland.-50-
(3)General.133. It will have been observed from paragraphs 19-21 that an expansion of the Ministry of Labour Instructional Centres is proposed in co-operation with the Forestry Commission.
VI.    PDSLIO WORKS.(1) General.134.   The present Government after full consideration has abandoned the polloy of state aided publio works for the relief of unemployment., and none of the Investigators recommend the re-Institution of relief works as suoh.     They suggest for financial assistance, however, a number of special projects, which are put forward on economic grounds but which would at the same time provide a good deal of much needed employment in the areas .135*   Before proceeding to examine these Individual   schemes it is neoessary to make certain observations,136*   Without returning to a system of relief works as such there are a number of public works (including road and bridge worls^ whioh are worthy of consideration for State financial assistance provided money Is available. - For example, from the County of Cumberland alone, the Ministry of Transport now have before them applications for grant from the Road Fund towards road Improvement schemes estimated to oost  84,500-. The execution of suoh works would assist to relieve the position in the depressed areas both by transferring men from those areas to dlreot employment on the works and by the Increase in industrial activity to whioh they would give rise.   It should be mentioned, however, that most of the sohemes mentioned by the Investigators are, from the point of view of the public welfare, of a low order of priority.137.   Notwithstanding the Governments deoision to discontinue finanolal- assistance for relief works it has at all times been open to the Local Authorities to apply for sanction to raise loans for necessary public works.     The Ministry of Health have neoessarily had to exercise great care in sanctioning fresh indebtedness in. areas with high rates, heavy debts and a doubtiu.1 future, but in no case has sanotion been refused to alcef*. for
works put f forward --onurgent -grounds-oT public   health.     This answers     general suggestion made by Sir Wyndham Portal that the Ministry of Health should If possible allow Looal Authorities to proceed with any Sewerage Sohemes which are absolutely necessary from the health point of view.138.   The provision of labour for public works on the basis of agricultural rates of wages, aa suggested by Sir Wyndham Portal, would be strenuously opposed on the ground that it would tend to lower the general level of wages in the public works oontractlng industry.159.   His further suggestion for undertaking works of this kind on the basis of a mid-day meal and a small allowanoe of pocket money, in addition to Unemployment Assistance, which is also suggested by Capt. Euan Wallaoe, provides a more promising line of approach.     This will be examined in conjunction with proposals to which the Unemployment Assistance Board will shortly be giving consideration. (2) Improvement of Whitehaven Harbour.140.    This is a scheme for improving Whitehaven Harbour at an estimated cost of  300,000 so as to enable vessels of 4,000 to 3,000 tons to use the harbour and thus help the development of the export trade in ooal from Whitehaven, as well as facilitating the exploitation of the newly found gypsum deposit.141.    The soheme has been considered by representatives of the Departments concerned in consultation with Mr. Davidson. Having regard more particularly to the fact that any expansion in the export trade of Whitehaven Ooal must In existing conditions be at the expense of that of other districts possibly more hard hit than Whitehaven, the. oonolusion was reaohed that the expenditure of public money on this scheme was impossible to justify and could not be recommended.     Nor did It appear that there were sufficient grounds for recommending State financial assistanoe towards a more limited soheme of improvement for deepening the sill at the entranoe to tho
Harbour and widening the width between the gates, in order to admit the passage of boats up to 2,500 tons.     These imprrr/ements are mainly designed to benefit the Colliery Company and a company whioh is about to exploit the gypsum deposits and, if the estimates of additional traffio whioh have been mentioned confidentially are likely to be fulfilled, the dues payable should be sufficient to meet the interest oharges on the further capital expenditure required.     At the same time, it is considered that these proposals should be brought to the notice of the Harbour Commissioners and the other interests^ oonoerned, with a view to seeing whether, with some re-organisation of the existing capital of the Harbour, the necessary sum oould not be raised and profitably expended without any burden upon public funds.     The possibility of action on these lines is being actively considered by the Departments e once me d.(3) Jarrow Slake.142*    Oaptain Wallace recommends that the Jarrow Slake soheme should be given consideration with a view to a grant-in-aid and the settlement of differences between the L.N.E.R. and the Tyne Commissioners.143*    Jarrcw Slake is a tract of shallow water near Tyne Dock on the South Side of the Tynte; between Jarrow and South Shields, about three miles from the open sea.       The proposal is to construct a deep water quay at Jarrow Slake and so to provide accommodation for vessels of larger tonnage than have hitherto been catered for on the river with a view to attracting additional traffio to the port.     As part of the soheme  -it is necessary that the Tyne Commissioners (who have statutory power to purchase) should acquire the&apos; Tyne Dock from the L.N.E.R. who would have to obtain Parliamentary sanction to sell,
144. In 1931 after consideration by the Unemployment Grants Committee and Ministry of Transport, and on the understanding that the L.N*-B.R. had agreed to seek Parliamentary power to sell the Dock and that the purchase price had been agreed, an Exchequer grant was approved in principle in respect of a scheme estimated to cost  1,350,000 exclusive of the purchase price of the Dock. The scheme was estimated to provide work for 1,400 men for three years in direct employment and indirectly for 600 men for 2^ years.145. In August 1931 at the time of the financial crisis promise of the Exchequer grant was withdrawn and the Commissioners postponed consideration of the scheme sine die.146. Recently proposals have been advanced for Government assistance towards a modified scheme estimated to cost  650,000.147. The question arose whether the suggested development would,in existing conditions, create new traffic or merely serve to divert traffic from other parts.     The Commissioners in their recent application point to the necessity of meeting &quot;the intensive competition of continental and certain other ports&quot;.In considering the proposal, therefore, regard must be had to theeffect of a grant upon other British ports such as those on theWear and the Tees, which are in competition with the Tyne andfrom which applications for similar grants will doubtless bereceived.     The iviines Department have stated that there is no prospect of creating additional coal traffic by new facilities ofthis kind.      It is,  therefore, very doubtful whether the capitalexpenditure on the scheme would be   anything but a permanentburden unlikely to yield a commercial return.      In any event, itwould be difficult for any Department usefully to intervene inany negotiations between the Tyne Commission and the RailwayCompany until the question of grant is decided in principle.For decision:    Should Exchequer grant be approved, in principle, subject to satisfactory conclusion-   to negotiations?
(4) Road Tunnel under the Tyne between. North and. South, Shields,, 148. Captain Wallace recommends that this s cheme he considered for an Exchequer Grant, on grounds first of the increased prosperity to which, he suggests, the improved cross river communication giving direct access from the North to Sunderland would he likely to lead and secondly of the employment provided in executing the scheme.149. Proposals for a bridge over the river or a tunnel under the river have been considered from time to time for over 100 years but have never come to anything.     Recently a firm of consulting engineers reported that a tunnel would cost about  1,240,000 and a bridge about  2,300,000.     In 1931 the Ministry of Transport stated that a bridge was virtually out of the question and that the maximum contribution from the Road Fund towards the cost of the tunnel would be 60;:j.     The Minister repeated to a deputation last month that, even if he were in a position to offer a grant, he could hold out no hope of a better offer than this, which is regarded as generous (the contribution to the Mersey Tunnel is  2-gm. out of a cost of  6m.).       The Admiralty have, however, been asked their views on a bridge, but no reply has yet been received..(September 27th).     A letter has just been received from the Town Clerk of Tynemouth stating that the Tyne Inprovement Commissioners would emphatically oppose the erection of a bridge.150. In the view of the Ministry of Transport a tunnel orbridge at the mouth of the Tyne would be a convenience to the locality but would not be accorded high priority as a scheme forbenefitting through traffic.For decision;  Should grant be offered in aid of tunnel?-56-DKmiismanBflHHwnflaHnBMmMHmB
(5KSewerage Bchemes in South Wales-151. Sir Wyndham Portal suggests that Imimediarte- ^ consideration he given to a proposal for relaying a main sewer (Naval Colliery to 3rita:nnia) under the Rhondda Urban District Council.152. The estimated cost of this scheme is nearly  40,000. . The Ministry of Health have held an enquiry and sanction will be given to borrow the necessary money, subject to settlement of some technical details. (6) The Senghenydd to Nelson Road.153. Sir Wyndham Portal suggests that consideration should be given to the proposal for this new road at an estimated cost of  34,000.154. No application has been made to the Ministry of Transport for a grant towards this road;    it is understood that, among other schemes, it was submitted by the Caerphilly Urban District Council to the Glamorgan County Council, who are the appropriate highway authority in 1929 but that it has not been sponsored by that body.    The two areas are small and relatively unimportant and a grant could not be justified on traffic grounds;    while the precarious position of the coal industry makes it unlikely that the Local Authority would be willing to spend a great deal on the scheme.    In so far as the road would be of advantage in enabling miners living at Senghenydd to get to their work in Nelson it is suggested that this point would equally well be met by some other method, e0g. by building more houses at Nelson.
VII.    Housing.(l) laigland Wales.155.  Captain Wallace and Sir Wyndham Portal make certain suggestions in regard to housing.155. Both recommend that slum clearance schemes should he proceeded with in the respective areas (in Durham the number of replacement houses over the five year period is put at 21,000) but whereas Sir Wyndham Portal thinks that other new housing schemes in South Wales would, owing to the declining   &apos; population and the relatively high standard of accommodation be a waste of money and should be carefully examined,Captain Wallace, in order to relieve over-crowding and to provide employment, recommends the provision of 50,000 new houses on Tyneside,    additional to the slum clearance schemes. The difference between the economic rent and the rent that the occupier could pay would be covered by an Exchequer grant. 157. Despite these differences in the Investigator&apos;s recommendations it is clear that, having regard to the similarity of conditions in the two areas, whatever policy is adopted for Durham must be applied to South Wales. 158.  The recommendations in regard to slum clearance are in accordance with present Government policy, which is to encourage the carrying out of the five years slum clearance schemes which have been submitted irrespective of the financial position of the Authority,159. As regards the provision of new houses other than houses to replace slum dwellings, it is proposed in the new housing bill at present in preparation that a liberal measure of Exchequer assistance should be made available to local authorities, to enable a low level -of rents to be charged for the new houses and flats required to accommodate such popula-tion as is found on a- survey of their districts by local authorities to be living in overcrowded conditions as defined in the Act.
160.  This&apos; new Sxchcquer asjsijrtan-ce- must-, however, he provided for all authorities on uni-Dorra- conditions,   and will leave part of the total cost on the rate fund.    Even when allowance is made for the relief to the rates resulting from the taking over of most of the burden of able-bodied relief by the new Unemployment Assistance Board, to whiah reference is made below, there may well be some authorities in the areas covered by the reports of the Commissioners whose financial position is so bad that they ought not, and possibly cannot, incur fresh burdens on the rates for housings though there may be no question that new housing in relief of over-crowding is badly needed in such places.161. To make a special provision for housing as such (on the lines for example of Captain I&apos;al3a.ce!s proposals) while leaving the work to tne Local Authorities is undesirable, as the latter, having no direct financial interest, would be unlikely to operate economically or effidienily.    The alternative of direct building by the State is Open to other objections.162. A possible method of avoiding these difficulties (assuming that some financial assistance must be granted to the distressed areas) would be to give a new consolidated grant, not directed towards any specific scheme but subject to the Authorities carrying out various services or worics including the provision of new houses to abate overcrowding and possibly land drainage and others.   Housing sohemes in these areas could then be dealt with on the same footing as in other areas.153. It should be added that according to recent estimates the provision of 50,000 houses spread over a period of ten years would provide employment for 6,000 men per annum directly and 3,000 to 4,000 men per annum indirectly.      The
Ministry of Health agree that in this case it would be desirable that only workmen from the areas in question should be employed and that if available all the materials should be drawn from local sources.    Pending the total survey to be provided for in the new housing bill, it is necessary to reserve judgment as to the extent of the new housing needed and the figure of 50,000 houses should be read subject to that condition.gor decision.Over and above the provision proposed in the&apos; new Housing Bill to meet overcrowding, should further financial assistance be granted to distressed areas by means of a new consolidated grant concentrated on housing alone?(2) Scotland.164.  Sir Arthur Rose in his discussion of the housing situation in Scotland states that much still needs to be done to effect slum clearance and to eliminate over-crowding,-  He refers in favourable terms to the progress which the Department of Health for Scotland and the local authorities are making with the present housing programme.165.  Sir Arthur does not make any recommendations nox* does he refer in detail to the question of overcrowding.  That question is a very serious one in Scotland and it is understood that proposals for dealing with it are at present under consideration as a matter of general housing policy.166.  In the circumstances it is considered unnecessary to pursue the matter here.  The Department of Health, however, call attention to the fact that the erection of houses to meet slum clearance and the abatement of overcrowding will help appreciably to ease the unemployment position in Scotland; and that the use of other than the usual materials (for example, steel) for construction may be of assistance in providing employment for workers in certain industries.
VIII. Looal Government and Administration. (I) Propoaed changes In Local Government areas and Analogous Proposals. 167. All the Investigators oomment on the problems of looal government, but whereas Sir Arthur Rose and Mr. Davidson are satisfied with the position in their respective areas and do not reOommend any changes, Captain Wallace and Sir wyndJb-am-Pxxrtad. both made suggestions for some revision.168. Captain Wallace draws attention to the difficult problems raised by the exlstenoe of a large number of different authorities in an area whose interests are largely homogeneous and recommends that some measure of unification of Looal Government authorities on Tyneside should be considered.     The difficulties of obtaining agreement to deal with the question of the pollution of the Tyne Estuary are mentioned as one example of the results of divided control.     In addition Captain Wallace suggests that consideration might be given to the transfer of all the Publio Dooks and QuayB on the River Tyne to a single Port Authority.169. Sir Wyndham Portal thinks that the status of County Borough has now become too onerous for Merthyr Tydfil to bear and recommends that consideration should be given to the possibility of taking steps to deal with looal administrative units suoh as Merthyr Tydfil In which the method of Government seems to be no longer appropriate to looal conditions. 170. It is suggested that the question of looal government arrangements on Tyneside and also that of the status of Merthyr Tydfil below referred to are appropriate for closer examination by a small oompetent Committee or Committees, specially appointed by the government for the purpose, after communication with the looal authorities oonoerned.
171.  It should-be added; vith regard to the question oi&apos; the ownership of the Docks and ^uays on Tynesidej  that a unifies ti or of the local government authorities would sivaplify this problem by reducing the number of bodies with whom negotiations vould have to be conducted.  If there is no early prospect of an amalgamation of local authorities3 the Minister of Transport would be willing to basic the Transport Advisory Council to consider whether they can usefully reviewed the v/ider proposals made by the ?.oyal Commission on Transport in 1930. for Public Trusts to control all the harbours in specified large districts.172. As regards South vales it is doubtful whether there is any advantage in pursuing the matter apart from Merthyr Tydfil, since it would be no advantage to the other County   Boroughs (Cardiff, Swansea and Newport; to be merged in their counties. A suggestion by the Ministry of Health to Merthyr that it should cease to bo County Borough was not favoured either by the Town Councils or by the Glamorgan County Council unless a Government grant were provided to meet the additional burden which would be thrown on the County funds,  especially in respect of public assistance.    The change of status might ease but would not remove the financial difficulties cf Merthyr Tydfil.173.  Certain small changes of areas have recently taken placein Glamorgan and Monmouth.For decisionsCommittee or Committees to examine local government arrangements on Tyneside and status of Merthyr Tydfil?(2) Local Rates.174.  In Cumberland Mr-  Davidson says that the areas are notheavily rated and do not carry any excessive debt burden.,175.   On the other hand Captain Wallace and Sir Wyndham Portalpoint to the exceptionally high rates at Durham and Tynesideand in South Wales respectively9 and refer especially to theburden of public assistance, and the difficulties that arise in its administration.
176. Gap tain ^allace^^speoli^c&apos; recK)mmeridatlonB are(l) The appointment of Commissioners to administer ordinary outdoor relief In the Administrative County of Durham (thiB proposal is made beoause of suggestions that the present admin is tr at1on Is extravagant and not free from abuse and beoause of the difficulties of a situation which, he&apos; says, has in Durham outgrown the oapaoity of the ordinary meohanlsm of Public Assistance). (2) An Exchequer grant to reduoe the oost of Publio Assistance in the county to the level of the whole country.(3) The application of the previous proposal to the County Boroughs of Sunderland and West Hartlepool. 177. A proposal was made to Sir Wyndhaxn Portal that the cost.x)f publio assistance burden should be a national charge, but he confines his recommendations to two(l) that no action should be taken until the effect of theUnemployment Assistance scheme on the Publio Assistance rate oan be seen.     But that if no substantial reduction results from the latter, the position, should be reviewed. (2) If possible, the liquidation of the Goschen loans should be extended to 20 years. 178. Admittedly the administration of relief in County Durham has been unsatisfactory but Captain Wallace&apos;s proposal for Commissioners to supersede the County Council involves legislation;    and the position of other counties (suoh as Glamorgan and Eonmouth) would have to be considered at the same time.     Further it is possible that, unless a very liberal grant were given, looal difficulties in collecting the required rate monies might arise.179. The proposed special grant to reduce the publio assistance rate to the average of the whole country would be a dangerous expedient, and would lead to demands from other areas for
similar treatment.     Out of 83 counties and 62 county boroughs-, 48 counties and 24 county boroughs have rates for out-relief above the average.     In any case an average rate would not provide a suitable datum line, because it would not allow for different circumstances, different standards of administration or different levels of assessment.180. As regards the general financial position of the depressed areas, Sir Wyndham Portal&apos;s conclusion is sound. Substantial assistance is given to them in the distribution of the block grant through the provisions of the Local Government Acts.     Further substantial assistance will be given when the Unemployment Act,  1934,  is in full operation.      If the relief under the latter Act proves to be les3 than is anticipated or if notwithstanding that relief the position of the areas as regards local rates is thought to merit special consideration, the review of the working of the block grant, which ha3 to be undertaken before 1st April, 1937, will provide a suitable opportunity for reviewing the question on the broadest basis.181.   With regard to Sir Wyndham Portal&apos;s suggestion for extending the period of repayment of the Goschen loans, considerable concessions have already been made, namely (l) release from payment of interest (2) period of repayment extended from 10 to 15 years (3) capital repayments in any year not to exceed the produce of a 9d. rate.     The latter concession alone was equivalent to writing off  594,000 in Monmouthshire and  86,000 in Merthyr Tydfil.182.    To extend the period would require legislation, and this would bring no relief to Monmouthshire or Merthyr Tydfil, unless the 9d. rate limit were reduced.183. Two other matters are referred to by Sir Wyndham Mortal which may be briefly mentioned here.
184. (l) The cost .sf public assistance,,   i-t Is-^said-, i.s bedng &quot; still furthe 1*- increased because 3 as a result of the National Insurance Act, 1932, numbers of people who formerly drew benefit under the National Health Insurance Scheme now fall to be dealt with by the Public Assistance Committees-This is true, but it must be remembered that liberal extension f*f benefit was granted to unemployed persons by previous Acts and that until at least the end of 1935 generous terms are provided for re-entering insurance on employment.185.  (2) A number of districts in South Wales will, from 1935 suffer the gradual withdrawal of certain additional grants under the Local Government Act, 1929. 186. This also is true, but.the position is not peculiar to South Wales, and it would be difficult to give the latter area differential treatment.     Unfortunately the very depression from which some of these areas in South Wales are suffering results in a decrease in population and a consequential reduction in the capitation grant, without a corresponding contraction in standing charges.      This is one of the matters that will be taken into account when the grant formula is reviewed before 1st April, 1937, as provided by the Local Government Act, 1929.     Por the time being, the position is being eased to some extent by the special temporary &quot;necessitous area&quot; grants (equivalent in the counties of Glamorgan and Konmouth to rates of 6d. and 4d. respectively), which will be continued until tho Unemployment Assistance Board take over the relief of the able bodied unemployed.     This latter transfer is expected to relieve rate funds over the country to the extent of about  2 m- annually, and a large proportion of that relief will naturally occur in the areas visited by the Investigators,
IX   Special Recommendations affecting the Coal Mining Industry. 187.A number of recommendations are mado by the Investigators affecting the coal mining industry,    Some of them although not mentioned by all the Investigators,  are of general application; others relate to the industry in the rospectivo areas.Goner al Rc contra o nd at ions. (1i Unification of- Coal Mining Royalties.188, This is recommended by Captain Wallace, Mr, Davidson suggests that the Government should consider Immediately the rodomption of all royalties on coal.  Sir Wyndham Portal refers to the heavy burden of royalties in South Wales, but makes no re c omme nd at i on.The question of the unification of coal royalties under consideration by a Committee presided over by the Secretary for Mines.(2) The Use of Coal or Coal Gas as fuel for Road Transport.190. Sir vVyndham Portal refers to a complaint that increased taxation in 1933 Is having the effect of driving steam vehicles off the road,191, He further mentions certain successful experiments that were said to have been carried out in connection with the use of coal gas as fuel for motor vehicles and recommends that the future of coal gas road vehicles should be explored as closely as possible,192,  On the question of steam road vehicles there has been a continuous decline In the number of such vehicles since 1926, Up to 1933 the same scale of vehicle- duty applied to steam,  petrol and heavy oil drive-n vehicles.    From 1st January,  1934, the duties on all vehicles exceeding 2-g tons in weight unladen were increased,   but in the  case of steam vehicles,  the increase on those over 6 tons v/as smaller than in the case of petrol driven vehicles.,  The increase on heavy oil driven vehicles was considerably greater still. Moreover,  steam vehicles enjoy the advantage of duty free fuel, whereas duty is payable both on petrol and on heavy oil. It cannot,therefore,be alloged that t.xa tion Is a cairi; of the
decline in the use of steam vehicles.     It seems clear that the continuous decline in the number of these vehicles must be attributed to technical rather than fiscal causes. 193. The widespread adoption of gas as fuel for motor vehicles&quot; would undoubtedly be a direct gain to the coal industry.     As compared with petrol it is cheaper in those districts where gas can be obtained at a relatively low rate, although not to the extent suggested in Sir &apos;.?ynahem Portal&apos;s report;    and other advantages are claimed for it.     Cn the other hand there are several disadvantages, which include the restricted range of... operations of vehicles using gas, the weight of the gas cylinders, which tends to bring the vehicles into a relatively higher taxation class, the small number of filing stations, the heavy capital cost of providing more stations, anu the recent develcpment of the diesel engined vehicle.     Progress has been made towards overcoming some of these disadvantages, and the Home Office, Ministry of Transport, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research,  and the Mines Department ere in touch with experiments undertaken by the National G-as Council and certain Gas Undertakings, and have done and will do everything possible  to encourage them.194. It should be pointed out, however, that the use of gas is likely for some time to be confined to heavy vehicles. According to present information only about half a dDzen public service vehicles and a dozen commercial vehicles are using coal gas,(3) Export Trade.in Coal.195. Although the actual proposals of the Investigators are directed toward the position in their respective areas,  the coal export trade is one which has a vital bearing -n the prosperity of all four areas and the subject can be conveniently dealt with under the heading of general recommendations.    The general policy of the Government (adopted with the concurrence of the coal trade)  is to negotiate with foreign countries trade
agreements which will permit cf the largest possible imports of United Kingdom coal into those countries.     At the same time it is generally accepted that the only permanent solution of the present difficulties in oversea competitive markets lies in a co-ordinated policy of international agreement, and it is for the coal trade to organise and pursue such a policy.     To this end discussions Initiated and encouraged by the Government are now in progress between the British and &apos;5olish coal industries. (a) South e/ales.196.Sir wyndham Portal draws attention to an allegation that the Traae Agreements with Scandinavia, while assisting the North East Coast, have indirectly penalised South Wales by driving foreign countries (and particularly Poland) now largely excluded by these agreements from the Scandinavian market into markets formerly held by South wales (especially Italy). He recommends that the Board of Trade should endeavour to negotiate a trade agreement with Italy on the same lines as those concluded with the Scandinavian countries, and also to exert all possible pressure on other countries which, in the past, were large importers of Welsh coal.197. The Trade Agreements so far concluded do not in general cover the countries which formerly were predominantly markets for South Wal3S coal and there is probably some truth, although not to the extent suggested, in the allegation thet the existing agreements   have resulted in the intensification in those markets of foreign competition against South Aales coal.     The policy of trade agreements, however, was aiopted with the full concurrence of the coal   trade which was well eeized of this possibility.      In any case in certain directions the policy has already resulted In definite benefits to the South tfalo3 coal trade on which both the Trade Agreement with Argentina and the Ottawa Agreement have conferred distinct advantages.198. The reduction in the imports of South Wales coal into Italy is part of a general reduction of imports of foreign
coal^into--that^country&quot; (fr^ tons in 1929 to0-J million tons in 1933;?    it has bsen.further--Intensified hy the policy of the Italian Government of granting trade concessions on a compensation basis with the result that the orders of the Italian State Railways which formerly came to South Tales have been diverted to other countries. Negotiations are at present proceeding with the Italian Government with the object of socuring additional and regular purchases of South Vales coal by the Italian State Railways in return for certain tariff concessions by the United Kingdom on articles of particular interest to Italy.199. As regards other countries the Board of Trade and Mines Department have constantly under review the possibility of improving the treatment accorded to imports of United Kingdom coal, and in particular are continuously on the lookout for any opportunity of assisting the South Wales Coal trade. Arrangements have been made with Prance which practically assure that there will be no discrimination against United Kingdom coal in that country, and negotiations with a number of other countries in which South Wales is specially interested are in progress or under consideration.Ob) Scotland.200.  Sir Arthur Rose mentions a development of the exports as a means of helping the coal industry in Ayrshire.    He makes no recommendations.201. Ayrshire has suffered loss of export trade to the Irish Free State as the result of the dispute with that countryj but this loss is exceeded by gains, shared with Lanarkshire and Fifeshire, which have accrued directly from the Trade Agreements with Germany, Finland and the Scandinavian countries. Some further slight advantages may be expected to follow the Agreements recently concluded with the Baltic countries.
202. Lanark has also Increased her exports of anthracite to Canada to record figures in 1933, a result mainly of preferences granted under the Ottawa Agreement.203. As regards the other chief markets for Scottish coal, negotiations are proceeding with Italy and the question of initiating discussions with Spain is under consideration.(c) Cumberland.204. Mr. Davidson put forward proposals for improving Vhitehaven Harbour with a vie..- to increasing the export of &quot;Whitehaven coal particularly to continental markets.205. This proposal is discussed in the section on Public Works (Paras.140-1).(&amp;) General.206. It seems probable that the limit of increasing coal exports by Government action has been almost reached unless the dispute with the Irish Free State were settled.    Such a sottlement would restore a substantial volume of trade to the United Kingdom especially South Wales and Scotland. Extraction of Oil from JJoai,207.  Three of the Investigators (the exception being Captain Wallace) refer to possibilities of development under this head, although such specific recommendations as are made (by Sir Wyndham Portal and Sir Arthur Rose) relate to their respective areas only.208.  It is the policy of the Government to encourage such developments so far as lies in their power, and Government action in two directions designed to assist lias recently been taken, vizs(a) The passing of the British Hydrocarbon OilsProduction Act, 1934, which guarantees a substantial preference over a period of years on motor spirit produced from coal, shale, or peat, or from products obtained from them;(b) The imposition of a duty of Id. a gallon on heavypetroleum oils imported into this country.209. Tho IoC.I. experiment at Billingham of trying out the hydrogenation process on a commercial scale is the direct
result of the as-slstarioe-provlded&apos;^ju-Lder-the British Hydrocarbon Oils Act;    and it is claimed that this Act and the heavy oil duty are resulting in an extension of the low temperature carbonisation industry.     Again the Admiralty have already purchased such small quantities as have been offered to them of fuel produced by the low temperature carbonisation process;    and it has been announced publicly that that Department will always consider offers of oil of suitable quality produced from coal provided the price is satisfactory, (a) SOUTH VALES.Hydrogenation.810. Sir Vyndham Portal recommends that a promise should be given that in the event of the 1.0.1. Hydrogenation Plant proving an economic success South Wales will be considered for the establishment of the next plant, which should be set up by 1.0*1. and not by the coal owners. 211. It will be some time (probably not less than about 13 months) before the new process can be proved out      It would clearly be difficult for the Government to obtain a promise from I.C.I. now that they would erect their next plant in a particular area.     But when the time comes to consider the erection of a second plant the I.C.I. can be relied upon to give full consideration to any representations which the Government might feel it necessary to make on national grounds as to the situation of the plant.     It should perhaps be mentioned here that the Admiralty, although of the opinion that the loss to the Louth Wales coal trade occasioned by the change over of the Navy from coal to oil has been exaggerated, feel that there is a strong case for supporting the claims of South Vales to participation in any extension of the coal hydrogenation industry.
(b) SCOTLAND.Low Temperature Carbonisation. 212. Sir Arthur Rose suggests that the deeper levels of the mid-Lanark coal field should be explored by means of borings, in case the successful development of the low temperature carbonisation process, by providing a new and considerable outlet for coal, should justify the exoense of opening up deeper seams than have so far been exploited. 213. The successful development of this process would almost certainly help the Lanarkshire coal trade.     But it is essential for she commercial success of the process that a market should be found for the semi-coke derived from it. The proportion of good domestic fuel obtained from the process is so high (in some cases as much as 15 cv/ts per ton of coal carbonised) that the increased demand for coal resulting from the displacement of new coal by this fuel would be relatively small, unless such displacement took place on a very extensive scale (probably extending to a very large proportion of all the raw coal at present consumed in Scotland for domestic purposes).     Even then it is doubtful whether the additional demand for coal would be so great as to require the development of deeper seams.Recommendations Affecting Particular Areas. South Vales.Draining of the South Wales coalfield.214.Sir Vyndham Portal recommends that a scheme for this purpose drawn up by Mr. Carey, Divisional Inspector of Mines-, should be proceeded with.     His further suggestion that the scheme should be financed by &quot;loan facilities&quot; is vague, but perhaps means that the Government should provide or guarantee in whole or in part the interest on the monies needed for the project.     It is estimated (presumably by the originator) that the scheme would provide work for approximately 2,000 men for about 4 years.
215. This proposal together-wlth--other schemes for deal-Log with mine water in the south Vales coalfield is being enquired into by a Committee set up by the South Vales owners.      This Committee is expected to report shortly. In the meantime it is not possible to comment on the recommendation.Liaison Officer for south Vales.216. Sir Vyndham Portal proposes the appointment by the Government of an Observer or Liaison Officer in South Wales. His functions are not very clearly defined, but he is apparently to stimulate schemes for the scientific utilisation of coal, for coal marketing and other matters, and there seems to be some suggestion that he would combine with these duties the role of conciliation officer.     The Investigator suggests a man like Mr. Frank Hodges. 217. In the absence of a fuller account of the duties of the post it does not seem possible to make any useful comment upon this proposal. The North Bast Coast. Drainage of Mines.218. Captain Wallace draws attention to the flooding of pits in Durham, and urges the necessity of considering (l) the de-watering of pits already flooded, (2) the taking of steps to prevent the flooding of further pits which are endangered by those already under water.219. The justification for the first of these two proposals would depend&quot;upon a largely increased demand.for coking coals from the iron and steel industry.    It is, however, unlikely that any appreciable shortage of coal for coking purposes will arise for a considerable time;    and accordingly the coal owners themselves would almost certainly not support a scheme for the re-habilitation of derelict pits so as to put them in competition with producing concerns. Captain Wallace is clearly alive to this difficulty.
220.   There are more-solid grounds for&apos; considering the proposal for a drainage scheme designed to safeguard existing concerns.      buch a scheme does not appear impracticable, but the Governments powers in such matters are very limited, and in practice depend upon a substantial measure of agreement among the coal owners themselves.     The first step should come from the coal owners themselves.      It has already been suggested to them that they should examine the position with a viev/ to the production of a practicable scheme,  and that the Mines Department would be prepared to give them every assistance in their power.221. It does not appear that Captain Wallace dissents from this view;   but he recognises that a main difficulty in obtaining any co-operative action on the part of the mine owners in Durham is the existence in the coalfield of a multiplicity of conflicting interests.      It is as a first step towards solving some of the difficulties and obstruction to which this lack of co-operation gives rise that he has proposed the unification of coal mining royalties^  to which reference has been made at the beginning of this section.
(1) The Iron end Steel Industry. 222. jjr. Davidson and Sir Wyndham Portal make certain suggestions regarding this industry.223. Mr, Davidson mentions a number of disadvantages both of divided control *md of unified control end makes a strong plea that the Government should intervene to secure a greater measure of co-operation among the various sections of the industry.     His specific suggestion that consideration be given to the redemption of the royalties on iron ore as a means of bringing some relief to the iron ana steel industry is referred to unaer the section on iron ore. 224. Sir Fyndham Portal&apos;s only specific proposal is that, unless the owners of the Ebbw Vale Steel Works will themselves take the initiative in stating whether the works are likely to re-open, an expert in the Iron and Steel trade should be appointed by the Government to report an the proBpects of the industry in the area with a view to a statement on this subject being made.225.   It seems hsruly possible for the Government to make a public pronouncement on the future of a private industrial undertaking.    There is admittedly a need for a comprehensive survey of the lines of development that the Iron and Steel industry should follow.     This can, however, best be done by the industry itself, and should be one of the first tasks of the Independent Chairman of the Executive Committee of the British Iron and Steel Federation when he is appointed;    and it may be hoped that the greater co-operation for which Mr. Davidson pleaas will flow from those activities.     But until the general survey in question has been made it would be impossible for the Government or any other body to give an authoritative opinion as to the desirability of maintaining a particular works.
(s) Iron Ore Mining. (a) Iron Ore Royalties in Jipat^G^p^lpxid^226c Mr.  Davidson, in his report, refers to the heavy burden of royalties on the iron ore mining industry, observing that the feeling is general that royalties should be reduced or redeemed.    In his subsequent letter to the Lord President of the Council he himself recommends that the Government should consider at once the redemption of all royalties on iron ore, so as to reduce the burden on that industry and also as a measure of relief to the iron and steel industry.227. The Mines Department has for some time been trying to secure a reduction in iron ore royalties.    As the result of negotiations between the various parties the royalty owners have offered a reduction in royalties contingent upon a reduction in freight rates from the 7est coast to the Iron ore smelting centres in the North L&quot;ast and Scotland.    The railway companies for their part have offered reduced freight rates subject to certain conditions, including a provision for a minimum traffic in this commodity between the areas in question. &quot;Further negotiations are now proceeding between the Iron Ore Producers and the Railway Companies, and the Mines Department is keeping in touch with developments.    A considerable expansion in the market for West Coast iron ore should follow a successful outcome to these negotiations if they bring the price of Cumberland iron ore on to a competitive basis with imported ore.(b) The.JLJLantiarry, Irpn^jQre. Mine.228.  The position of this mine is referred to by Sir Wyndham Portal. The working of the mine depends entirely upon orders received from Messrs. Guest, Keens, who at present are taking about 3,000 tons of ore from the mine. If Messrs.Guest, Keens could be induced to take a financial interest in the mine and to increase their orders for Llanharry ore in substitution for some of the ore they atpresent import from their mines in Spain,
there would he s relair;rvely&quot;sub-6i^ni^^ to theempleymeniv.jprcvid.ed by the mine.     At present the number of men employed on a single shift basis is about 250j    it is said that a double shift could be workeu and 550-600 men employed if sufficient orders were received.229. It is understood that,  as Sir Vyndham Portal states, negotiations have taken place between the two Companies with a view to Messrs. Guest, Keens acquiring a financial interest    in the Llanharry mine.      It is difficult for the Government to intervene in what are purely commercial negotiations;    although the Mines Department have, in fact, been in touch with both parties from time to time.(6) The Shale Mining Industry in Scotland. 230. Sir Arthur Rose explains in his Report the position of this industry in some detail;   but he offers no suggestion for assisting it.231. The decline in the industry in recent years has been uue largely to the great development in the petroleum industry and the low price of petroleum products;    in addition the industry has suffered by a aiminution in the quantity of oil obtained from the  hale - e decline of more than 50 per cent,  since 1860. The employment situation has been assisted to seme extent by the refining of imported crude oil at Grangemouth and Uphall where some of the displaced shale-miners have obtained work. The industry has also obtained substantial benefits from the various measures that have been adapted for encouraging and protecting the supply of home produced oil.232. A consiuereble amount of thought has been given by Ministers tc the position of the industry;    but apart from the measures already mentioned it has not been found practicable to adopt any cf the numerous suggestions for assisting the industry that have from time to time ccme under consideration.    In view of the present position cf the petroleum industry - abundant supolies and a low level of prices   - no expansion in the shale industry can be  expected,
(4) Restriction of the Employment of Women.233.. XJep-tain Wallace reaches the conclusion that it is necessary to consider seriously some limitation of the fields of female labour.234, Proposals of this kind are frequently &quot;based on the assumption that women have displaced men in industry.     In fact there is no evidence that this is so, to any considerable extent. Indeed, in the distributive trades, to which Captain Wallace draws special attention as having been affected by the &quot;invasion&quot; of women, the proportion of insured males to insured females in employment was as high in 1933 as in 1923,235. It is possible that the exclusion of women from certain classes of industry would result in the employment of more adult males.     But such a measure would mean a radical alteration in the costs - particularly wages - of the industries in question and would have effects of the very greatest importance upon existing agreements and upon the whole wage structure of numerous industries.     In addition a declared policy of replacing women by men in industry generally or in any selected industry would be bitterly opposed by the whole force of the womens movement. (5) Restriction of juvenile employment.236. In order to increase adult employment it has been recommended by Captain Wallace that consideration should be given to the desirability of placing some limitations on the employment of young persons.237. This is possible in theory by(i) reducing the hours of juvenile employment; (ii) prohibiting juvenile employment in certain industries or in certain areas or in certain age groups.238, Hours of juvenile Employment.     By means of Shops Legislation the Government are taking steps to reduce the hours of juvenile employment in the distributive trades.     It is doubtful
if any further lirai tation of hours would have any material effect in increasing adult employment.239. Prohibition of Juvenile Employment Generally.      It is not practicable to prohibit juvenile employment generally without providing some alternative occupation.      One way of doing this would be to raise the school leaving age, but the Government in July announced that they did not intend to take this step; Compulsory Day Continuation Schools would probably have little effect on the volume of juvenile employment unless the period of attendance required was much longer than that provided for in the Education Act,  1918, (i.e,  roughly eight hours per week). Attendance for, say, fifteen hours per week would doubtless reduce the volume oi juvenile employment, but apart from financial considerations would be open to serious objections.240. If young persons attended Day Continuation Schools for the equivalent of 15 hours a week, whether between 14 and 16 or between 14 and 18 years of age, the number of units available for employment vjoxxld be halved for that age group and an employer would have to engage two juveniles, presumably at considerably reduced wages, instead of one.241. Among the objections which might be urged against such a system are the following;-(a) It is not clear whether industry could readily adapt itselfto a double-banked system of this kind, (bj At the age when attendance at Day Continuation Schoolsceased half the juveniles, broadly speaking, would have to find new jobs, and unemployment,  even if only temporary, at     15 or 18 would probably be materially increased owing to the difficulties in securing other types of employment. (c) The entry to skilled occupations might be prejudiced since the immediate financial prospects in these occupations are often comparatively unattractive and the child and the parent would not only know that there was an even chance of
his having to leave the job at 16 or 18, but that the training received would in many cases be entirely wasted.(d) The psychological effect of uncertainty on the childwould be bad and good relations between young employees would be seriously prejudiced.242.  It may be added that in so far as the system involved substantially reduced wages there would be a strong demand for payment of maintenance allowances to Continuation School pupils. Further, the system would no doubt have to be universal, and effective provision of the necessary premises, etc. would take considerable time.243, Prohibition of Juvenile Employment in Certain Areas.    In theory there is much to be said in favour of raising the school-leaving age by by-law in the depressed areas in England and Vfales. i-ractical experience of the by-law system as at present administered shows, however, that a very large proportion of pupils are exempted from school attendance between 14 and 15, and the system as at present operated is practically worthless as a measure for limiting juvenile employment or increasing adult employment.      To raise the age without power of exemption leads to movement into the area of boys and girls under 15 from surrounding areas, and it would be necessary to make employment of such children illegal if the scheme were to be effective as a measure for dealing with unemployment.     The additional cost   that would fall on the Local -education Authorities in the depressed areas and the present position of educational reorganisation in those areas are other factors to be considered, and the Board of education and the Scottish Education Department should be consulted if further consideration is to be given to this possibility.      It may be added that a large number of Authorities who wish to see the school leaving age raised have rejected the procedure by bye-laws as impracticable.244. Prohibition of Juvenile Employment in Certain Industries.. It would be possible to pass legislation prohibiting the employment
of, say, boys under 16 in the main industries of the depressed areas, such-as mining and ship-building.      This would, however,dislocate the organisation and increase the wage bill of ,industry, which need help rather than hindrance,and it wouldresult in increased juvenile unemployment in the depressed areas where the problem is already serious..     It is not therefore recommended.(6) General Reduction of hours of work.- 245. This is a difficult general question referred to by captain Wallace, which is under consideration in conjunctionwith the employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisatione.(7) Payment of Unemployment Benefit or Assistance in certain circumstances^246. Certain of the recommendations of the Investigatorsraise the question whether unemployment benefit or assistancein certain circumstances, for example during training,cultivating an allotment or while seeking to develop smallholdings.247. Under the existing law unemployment benefit will, in general, be available to men undergoing training in agricultural work, or.cultivating an allotment,  subject to the applicant&apos;s availability for work.      ilxperience has shov/n that there is little need in the case of men in receipt of benefit for an alteration in the law to enable them to continue to receive it while seeking to develop small-holdings.      The problem arises, ratherj amongst men who have exhausted their rights to benefit; it will be considered by the Unemployment Assistance Board. (S) Provision of keals at Junior Instruction Centres.248. The matter of possible malnutrition of boys and girls is referred to by three of the Investigators and Mr. Davidson recommended that the question of the provision of a mid-day meal at Junior Instruction Centres should be reconsidered.
249. There is no power for the Ministry of Labour or for education Authorities to provide free meals at Junior Instruction Centres and the Government announced as recently as the 8th May, 1934, that it is opposed to such provision.      Arrangements have however been made for milk to be supplied through the Milk Marketing Board at greatly reduced rates to unemployed boys and girls attending such Centres, and it is hoped that Education Authorities will see that advantage is taken of these arrangements. (This scheme has not yet come into operation in Scotland).    It will probably be necessary to consider whether this is adequate or whether further provision should be made.(9) Medical Service for Unemployed Boys and Gitols.250. Some of the Investigators raise the question of providing medical examination for unemployed boys and girls.251. The Unemployment Act, 1934, enables Education Authorities to provide free medical service for unemployed boys and girls attending Junior Instruction Centres.      Authorities are being encouraged to make the necessary arrangements for those boys and girls who are not entitled to the benefits of the Health Insurance Acts.(lO) Proposal to subsidise the candidature of children from the Depressed Areas for Civil Service Examinations.252. Mr. Davidson recommends that a grant should be provided to give Secondary School children from depressed areas as good an opportunity of entering for the Civil Service Clerical Examination as children from more prosperous areas.253. Any proposal that the Civil Service Commissioners should waive fees for children from a particular locality cannot be entertained.      The fee for the particular group of examinations mentioned is  2;    the fee for other examinations, e.g. Writing Assistants, is only 10/-.      It is probable that travelling and subsistence expenses are a more serious obstacle;    these expenses   -
could &quot;be reduced if centres could be arranged nearer thechildren&apos;s homes, and the Commission will be willing toconsider such proposals.     The minimum economic centre is forthirty candidates:    any proposal for a multiplication of smaller centres might be a little expensive and would beinconvenient.( 11) Admission of Cumberland Iron-Ore miners to the.Coal Mining Industry.254. Mr. Davidson recommends that, if the coal-miningindustry develops as he thinks it will, the restrictions on the entry into.the industry under Section 18 of the Mining industry act, 1926, should be relaxed so as to permit iron ore minersbelonging to the Cumberland area to enter the coal-miningindustry.255. If the coal mining industry in Cumberland should develop to such an extent as to result in the absorption of the unemployed coal-miners in West Cumberland, it might be necessary to consider whether the coal mining industry should be invited to modify the present agreement, arising out of Section 13 of the Mining Industry Act, 1926,  so as to permit of the entry into their industry of iron-ore miners of that area.(12) Unemployment and Public Health. 256. Paragraph 43 of Mr. Davidson&apos;s report on Cumberland and Haltwhistle, attributes to Dr. fraser, the County Medical Officer of Health, the view that the effects of prolonged unemployment are found in(l) a higher infant death rate (2) a higher maternal death rate(3) an increase in the number of notifications of tuberculosis.257. The question how far the prolonged unemployment is affecting the public health is exhaustively examined in the Annual Reports of the Chief Medical Officer for the years 1932-3
and 1933-4, and receives continuous attention in the Ministry. The view attributed to Dr. fraser could certainly not be accepted without much qualification, if indeed it is valid, jst sJJLr-(13) Unemployed men ,as members of public bodies,1258, This matter is referred to by Sir Wyndham Portal, who considers that it gives rise to an &quot;impossible&quot; situation;   He states that in one area which he visited, where there was a vacancy for a school attendance officer, members of the Urban District Council were actually standing for the job.259. Possible troubles which may arise are manifest, but it is scarcely practicable to provide that an unemployed man shall not be eligible for election.     Applications for public posts by members of Local Authorities are not confined to those who are unemployed.     It may be mentioned that the Local Government Act passed last year provides that a person may not be appointed to a paid office under a Local Authority if he has been a member of that Authority within the previous twelve months. ( 14) Government Research into the Industrial Position..260. Mr, Davidson states that there is need for a continuous survey of the problems of the depressed areas, and suggests that the Government should set up proper machinery for continuously surveying the industrial position, since wider enquiry from the angle of employment rather than unemployment will, he thinks, be needed than either the &quot;Ministry of Labour or the Unemployment Assistance Board can undertake with their existing powers.261. It seems clear that, at any rate for some time to come, numerous questions connected with the depressed areas will engage the constant attention of a number of Government Departments and the Unemployment Assistance Board, each in their respective spheres, and it is not clear that there would be any material advantage in establishing special machinery.     Two surveys of the areas have been made during the last   five years
and another might usefully be made in a few years1   time, though it should not be forgotten that a public investigation by Government representatives must necessarily raise hopes of ameliorative action.(15) Appointment of a Local Administrator. 262. Captain Wallace proposes the appointment of a Commissioner to co-ordinate all activities in connection with Government schemes for the rehabilitation of the Durham and Tyneside area.      Such a Commissioner should not be under the necessity of referring any but major questions to London.      This suggestion must be considered in relation to all the areas, since presumably if a Commissioner were appointed for one area, similar appointments would have to be made for each of the others.      It is difficult to see the value of such appointments unless the Commissioners were given considerable funds and powers.
