Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1934.Copy No.    3fJCABINET.IMMIGRATION POLICY IN PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE annexed Memorandum, which I have received from the High Commissioner, is so interesting and so balanced that I think my colleagues would like to read it. We are fortunate indeed in having so wise a man in so difficult a post.Sir Arthur Wauchope adds in a letter to me that the reorganised Immigration Department has now dealt with all the 7,000 arrears of applications.(Initialled) P. C.-L.downing  Street, August 20, 1934.Some Factors in Our Present Immigration Policy.1. I am never very willing to grant a Supplementary Schedule, nor am I very happy to think that the total number of Jewish immigrants entering Palestine in 1934 may be near 50,000; nevertheless, I consider that the facts as stated by you, and the arguments put forward by Ben Gurion and my own investigations, justify both the additional 500 under Category A 3 and the Supplementary Schedule of 1,200.2. No one here of any responsibility has ever suggested to me that in assessing the Schedule I am influenced by a desire to conciliate Arab opinion. They know the answer they would get if they did.3. The main difference between the Agency and myself on this subject is that hitherto the number they asked for has been based on what they consider to be the immediate needs of the country, whereas, as High Commissioner, I am bound to consider the capacity of the country permanently to absorb the numbers admitted each year. The latter, I admit, is most difficult to assess, but the fact of its difficulty would not justify my leaving it out of consideration. Also, greatly thanks to your memorandum to the Cabinet, I am entitled to consider the question of Arab unemployment, though that factor at the present moment is of small importance; in the future, however, it may well become of consequence.4. The chief arguments stated by Laski and his friends for a much larger Schedule are summed up in your letter of the 29th : (1) That something should be done to stop the migration from the land tothe towns. (2) To stop the inflation of wages.(3) To curb speculation in land and buildings and encourage legitimate enterprises.To these I add a fourth argument put to me in the plainest language by Weizmann and the Agency : (4) The urgent importance of increasing the number of Jews in Palestine so that they should number at least one-half of the total population and so be in a position to disregard Arab protests or opinion.SECRET.CP. 209 (34).

Their number reached 12,550 in October 1933 and 15,000 in July 1934.(Figures communicated by the Statistical Department of the Executive of the General Federation of Jewish Labour, letter No. MA/2/7 of July 2nd, 1934. (Dr. W. Preuss.) )(5) That the political and economic sufferings of the Jews in the Diaspora justify an exceptional immigration in these years. Most Jews hold that every Jew has a moral right to enter his Fatherland; no High Commissioner has the right to stop him.(4) and (5) are arguments dictated by political necessities of Jews and do not emerge naturally from consideration of the economic needs of Palestine. But they must be mentioned, because the critics of my policy are to some extent disingenuous in advancing considerations apparently economic in character but nevertheless dominated by the background of political necessities as Zionists conceive them.I will deal with these five arguments.Argument I.5. The first, that of the migration from the land to the towns, is the most serious, for it has often been stated here, and in England, that this migration is not only causing land to be uncultivated and citrus groves to be ruined, but is undermining the whole future well-being of the National Home by upsetting the proper balance between townsfolk and agriculturists. This migration, it is claimed, is the direct result of the limited Schedule.6. Papers &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B,&quot; prepared by the Jewish Federation of Labour, show the facts.
From these it is clear that the true ratio is as stated below : 1926 : 4J labourers in towns to 2 in rural districts. 1930 : 3 labourers in towns to 2 in rural districts. 1932 : 3 labourers in towns to 2 in rural districts. 1933 : 3 labourers in towns to 2 in rural districts. 1934- (June): 3 (30,000) labourers in towns to 2 in rural districts..7. There is no evidence that land is going out of cultivation, nor that citrus groves are being ruined, though a certain number have suffered from lack of skilled labour and others by lack of hard work during the past two months. None the less, I am in full sympathy with Mr. Ben Gurion&apos;s desire to ensure that the ratio of workers in the land should be fully maintained, and I recognise that there would be a danger of this ratio changing in the future unless both the Agency and myself took steps to guard against it.8. During a recent interview I had with the National Farmers&apos; Federation (Jewish), who are opposed to the employment of Arab labour, they stated that in 1930 43,000 dunums of citrus groves gave employment to 8,500 workers, that is one worker to five dunums. That now, owing to shortage of labour, 130,000 dunums gave employment to 4,500 workers, that is one worker to thirty dunums. I questioned the accuracy of both statements. The leader of the deputation is an old friend of mine and manages Pardessana. I asked him how many dunums were under his charge; he said 2,000 and that these were worked by eighty labourers, that is one man to fifteen dunums.One worker to thirty dunums would entail most serious neglect. The figures given by Mr. Smilansky of the Farmers&apos; Federation, another body which is not opposed to the employment of Arabs so long as these are in the minority, gives these figures for citrus cultivation : one worker for ten dunums in bearing plantations, and one worker for twenty dunums in non-bearing plantations. One worker to fifteen dunums is not a bad ratio when one remembers that many of the Pardess groves are of under four years&apos; growth; but I agree that such a ratio is not sufficient for extension of groves, nor to provide labour for the picking season. The picking season is a harvest season, and for all harvests additional labour must be obtained, as, for instance, for hop-picking and fruit-picking in England. Last year, I was told, the citrus crop could not be gathered for lack of harvesters. But special efforts were made, and in the event I doubt if one tree was not picked or- one orange not packed for lack of labour.9. I am not anxious that the present rate of increase in planting of citrus should be increased. The Commissioner of Lands informs me that the increase in citrus groves1930-32 was 10,000 dunums; 1932-33 was 28,000 dunums; 1933 to June 1934 was 40,000 dunums.10. These figures do not support the contention that land cannot be cultivated for lack of labour. A much wiser policy for farmers to pursue would be to decrease somewhat this extraordinary rapid rate of increase of new plantations, and so hold a reserve of labour to ensure the full cultivation and picking of groves already planted. I should also prefer to see a steady, but not too rapid, increase of land under citrus, so that improvement in shipping, marketing and checking disease might advance *pari passu with the increase of crop.Argument II.11. To check inflation of wages is no easy job in any country. Lack of labour is the chief, but not the only, factor. Four years ago the total immigration was 4,000 a year; but last year and this year it will exceed 40,000. Until recently many men and women of the wrong type have been admitted. The Jewish Agency and other bodies are realising this and are now directing their energies to remedying the situation. I have also caused them to be told that the rebuilding of unemployment funds by the Federation of Jewish Labour would be prudent. The reorganisation of the Immigration Department has already begun, and, under Mr. Mills, and with the co-operation of the Agency, I think we shall be more successful in securing the right type of immigrant and in foreseeing the real needs[10417] b2
of labour in the country, and, what is equally essential, in ensuring that these needs are supplied, and less consideration given by the Agency to &quot;political necessities.&quot;12. Inflation of wages is due not only to shortage of labour but also to poor work and slackness. Many Jewish labourers at present act as many British labourers acted after the war; their energy by no means corresponds to their high wage. This is a commonplace among Jews themselves, though they deny it stoutly to me. None the less, Ben Gurion, in my last interview, did admit I had not been altogether wrong when I suggested there were many slackers among the present-day labourers. In fact, to meet the evil, the Jewish authorities started last month a system of piece-work and are already confident that by this means a much larger output per worker will be obtained.They are also altering their system of agricultural settlement, by which more responsibility (necessitating harder work) will be thrown on the settler and less on the Jewish National Fund.13. You will remember I told you that Rutenberg and others asked me to admit specially 1,000 Yemenites, who would, they said, do a good day&apos;s work for a fair day&apos;s wage, in contradiction to many of the new arrivals from Eastern Europe.   The question of Asiatic immigration requires consideration.14. The last three years have shown me that the Jewish mentality here leads to genuine&apos; fears, which are never realised to the extent imagined. I must discount constant, if genuine, exaggeration.15. I do not suggest that there is no shortage of labour in town and on the land; I always admit it to the Agency, but I maintain it is exaggerated. Otherwise the amount of new citrus groves (at least two-thirds of which are Jewish) could not be doubled in two years, nor would the Directors of Potash, Cement and Hydro-Electric Works be now all in the process of doubling their present plant.16. To ensure an immediate fall in wages, I should have to admit, not a thousand workers, but ten thousand or twenty, and that would bring about far greater evils to the country as a whole, were these thousands not permanently absorbed, than the difficulties employers are at present faced with.17. I -consider the policy you suggested, which I have carried out as far as I can in the present circumstances, in this Supplementary Schedule, is far wiser, namely, to secure permits to meet the specific needs of specific employers.Argument III.18.   To curb speculation and encourage sound enterprise.19. I think speculation in land and buildings was inevitable owing to the great influx of capital and of small capitalists during the past two years. It has caused a lack of equilibrium between the capital and labour received, recently into Palestine.20. Fourteen millions of capital at present awaits investment. This is not due so much to shortage of labour-though that is a secondary factor as to the natural time it takes for an investor to decide on the best means to invest his capital. It is also due to the somewhat restricted ppportunities for investment. There are no great natural resources in the country awaiting development apart from the difficult and expensive settlement of areas like Huleh and the Jordan Valley. A man with  P. 1,000 hopes to find a means of investment by which he will not only get interest but find an opening for himself as a worker. Many are content and wisely so to work for a few years and keep their capital in reserve. Others try to make a fortune in no time, and many have doubled their capital within a year of arrival. Should an ebb succeed the present flow, these speculators will lose their capital and consequently their means of livelihood.21. The number of workers arriving as immigrants per immigrant capitalist during 1932 was 3-2; during 1933 it was 3-4; and for the first five months of 1934 was 2-4. I shall try to work the proportion up to 3 workers per capitalist during the course of this year. This should have as its effect some reduction in the prevailing rates of wages and in the costs of production generally, and the encouraging of sound enterprises.
Argument IV.22. Needs no discussion. It would be contrary to the regulation of immigration in accordance with the principle of absorptive capacity.Also the country is not ready to receive a sudden influx of -this character. Already there are very great difficulties in the way of providing services such as education and health, sufficient houses and sanitation for the numbers of immigrants who have recently arrived.A rgument V.23.   This argument also ignores the principle of absorptive capacity.I am of course anxious to assist oppressed Jews, and by allotting a propor-tion of the Labour Schedule to German immigrants and by placing no further restrictions on capitalists, I feel that the Palestine Government has done some-thing definite to help oppressed Jews.I have mentioned before that a very rapid increase in the number of immigrants leads to certain difficulties. The acting Mayor of Tel-Aviv told me to-day that there are 15,000 people living at present in temporary barracks in Tel-Aviv, the sanitary arrangements of which, he admits, are most unsatisfactory.In my letter to you of the 19th July, 1934, I gave you five conclusions which affect the capacity of the country permanently to absorb immigrants. In my letter of the 30th May I gave some quotations from the Annual Report of the Central Bank of Co-operative Institutions in Palestine showing the dangers of a too rapid rate of industrial expansion. The advantages of immigrants being admitted on a fairly level scale and not varied each year from a high peak to a low level are obvious. By the former method immigrants have a greater chance of understanding the new conditions of a new country, and consequently of being truly and permanently absorbed in the country&apos;s economic life.A notice on a road near Port Said reads : &quot;II faut conduire tres lentement.&quot; I do not suggest this as a motto for our Immigration Office; and immigration figures of the past three years show I have not been guided by that advice, but rather by the opinion of Waver ley&apos;s friend Maclvor, who said that &quot; a ganging foot is aye ganging.&quot;Three years&apos; experience has taught me that all Jewish criticisms have to some extent to be discounted. It is just because ,their apprehensions are genuine that they lead to genuine but exaggerated criticisms.Three years ago the demand for security of person and property dominated every mind, but the foundations of general security are now recognised as being firmer each year.With the arrival of Mr. French came the universal but groundless fear that all sale of lands would be prohibited; yet 160,000 dunums have been sold to Jews during the last two years. Last year it was argued that the results of the Municipal elections would stop all progress and place Jews in towns such as Jerusalem and Haifa in a position of hopeless inferiority; now that the elections are nearly decided, it is obvious that no community will suffer. This year, when 40,000 or 50,000 Jews enter the country, we are told both enterprise and industry are being ruined. I answer that, if we except a number of Arab villages, there is no country where prosperity, progress and happiness are more obvious, and few where the security of a minority is so well assured. Next year I know I shall be told by every Jew in the country that the whole of the success of the past three years will be effaced, that the National Home will be endangered, and the Jewish community sacrificed to the will of the Arab majority by the establishment of a Legislative Council, even of one with limited powers.I maintain that our policy as to the Jewish National Home has not been a failure these last three years; the National Home has been enlarged beyond expectation; and I now see only two causes that can endanger its stability, infernal strife among the Jews themselves, or some unexpected disaster caused, for example, by a further heavy fall in the mark and the zloty, which would have dangerous results on a people so many of whom live only just over the border-line between well-being and distress.Revisionists and others try to show that our &quot;restrictive policy&quot; is endangering the good relationship between responsible Jews and England.  Arabs
and Jews are, and will remain, critics and carpers so long as they have a foreign Government to gird at, but the enclosed letter from Ben Gurion, perhaps the most influential and responsible Jew in Palestine, shows that, outside Revisionist circles, Jews in Palestine have by no means lost faith in the goodwill of England.ARTHUR WAUCHOPE.Note. The fact that the figures shown in Table A and B were given by the Jewish Federation of Labour should not be stated in public, as otherwise this source of information would quickly cease to flow.The Jewish Agency for Palestine, Office of the Executive, P.O. Box 92, Jerusalem, Dear Sir Arthur, July 23, 1934.AT our last interview you cautioned me not to expect a large additional schedule. I did not, and am now able, without reserve, to express my deepest appreciation, in which all of us share, at your decision, which is a further proof of your open mind and goodwill towards our work and its needs.I am quite aware of the fact that the additional certificates you granted us now in the middle of the half-yearly period is four times larger than the entire schedule granted three years ago, just prior to your arrival to this country. Jewish history and I believe also Palestine history will appreciate the remark-able change that has taken place in the course of the three years of your adniini-stration. I am confident that no one knows better than, you do the part played by the Jews in effecting this change, but there is no one among us who does not appreciate how great is the part played by the man entrusted with the destiny of the country for the last three years.The fact that the number of certificates granted us is far from meeting our needs (I ought, perhaps, to apologise for mentioning it on this occasion) does not in any way diminish our appreciation or gratitude. This gesture of goodwill is especially dear to us, showing as it does, once more, your understanding and concern for our work. The practical assistance given us is considerable, but the moral aid is still more important. On our difficult road up-hill, the encourage-ment and moral support of a sincere friend are of inestimable value.There still exists a marked difference in our respective attitudes as to the volume of immigration possible and desirable at this moment. If I understood you correctly, you do not disagree to any great extent with our estimate of the immediate needs and absorptive capacity of the country at the present moment. But you have a different opinion as to the country&apos;s prospects and possibilities in the near future. We do not possibly perceive certain factors which are apparent to your broader range of vision, and it may be that we do not take into account some facts which are, in your view, of importance.However, it seems to me that we may say with a clear conscience that our estimates are based not only upon the great distress of our people, which drives us to proceed in the upbuilding of the country with all possible speed, but upon the confidence derived from fifty years of experience of the creative abilities of our people and of the latent resources of the country. During the course of our work we have more than once met with set-backs and failures. But the vital need of our people, the stubborn urge for survival of a nation not entirely devoid of creative ability, has enabled us to overcome all obstacles.If we have not, to our great regret, always been able to share your attitude of caution and apprehension as to the future it is not because of our failure to appreciate your motives actuated by a feeling of deep responsibility towards this country : but because of our belief that our work in this country rests upon a strong and solid basis, perhaps not always in evidence, but yet existing and real, the basis of the creative possibility of a people that will not permit its achieve-ment to suffer at a time of crisis.In the course of three years, the volume of immigration has increased from 4 to 40,000. But for your sympathy, goodwill and high statesmanship, this achievement would have been impossible.   I am not aware of a parallel example
oin the history of the administration of any other country of immigration. To close one&apos;s eyes to this fact would be more than ingratitude: it would be sheer stupidity.We, however, believe that the possibilities and needs of the present moment are even greater than this remarkable attainment.In your latest decision, I see a new indication that you do not rest content with previous achievements, and this seems to me to be one of the characteristic features of your administration.Yours very sincerely, (Signed) D. BEN-GURION.His Excellency,Lieut-General Sir Arthur G. Wauchope, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., C.I.E., D.S.O.,Government House, Jerusalem.
