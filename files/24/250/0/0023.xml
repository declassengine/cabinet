MIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.Copy NoPROPOSED RATIFICATION OP INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONVENTION CONCERNING THE PROTECTION OP WORKERS LOADING AND UNLOADING SHIPS .Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Minister of Labour.A draft International Labour Convention relating to the prevention of accidents in docks, was first adopted at the Conference of 1929, and representatives of the employers and workers concerned and of the Home Office were thereupon invited to consider the Convention in detail and to report what alterations would be necessary in the existing British Code, should H.M. Government decide to ratify the Convention.     A series of conferences was accordingly held, but examination showed that,  though the draft Convention followed closely the lines of the British Regulations,  there were points of difference of so serious a nature as to render ratification impossible, without upsetting long established methods of working which experience had proved to be satisfactory.      There were, moreover,  certain requirements in the Convention,  the precise meaning of which was obscure .These points were brought by H.M. Government to the notice of the International Labour Organisation and at the Conference of 1932 a revised draft Convention was adopted. The conferences between the representatives of the industry and this Department were then resumed and, as a, result, a report was presented at the end of last year,   containing unanimous proposals for such alterations in the Docks Regulations,  1925, as would enable H.M. Government to ratify the revised Convention.
-Q 0 0 cJThese alterations have now been embodied in revised Regulations which came into force on the 1st June,  and corresponding Regulations came into force in Northern Ireland on the same day.There is,  therefore, no obstacle to ratification by this country of the Convention and we suggest that we be authorised to apply for the necessary Order in Council and to communicate the ratification to the Secretary General of the League of Nations.At the same time as the revised Draft Convention a recommendation was adopted by the Conference to the effect that arrangements should be made by the Governments of the principal countries concerned,  to confer with a view to securing reasonable uniformity in the application of the Convention,  including more particularly the mutual recognition of the arrangements made for testing,  examining, etc. and the preparation of common forms of certificates relating thereto for international use - the steps taken to be reported annually to the International Labour Office. His Majesty&apos;s Government took the initiative in calling a preliminary Conference for that purpose in July,  1932, and the International Labour Office has been asked to arrange for a further Conference .     It is proposed now formally to aficept this recommendation .If our proposals are accepted, the Government&apos;s intentions will be communicated to Parliament as usual by means of a White Paper .J . G. 0 .S .20th July,  1934 .
