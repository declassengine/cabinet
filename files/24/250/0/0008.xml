HIS DOCUMENT IS THE HIOPSRTX OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT).NATIONAL SALLEH2 (OVERSEAS LOANS) BILLo Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Workscla 1930, following on a recommendation of the Royal Commission on Museums and Galleries, the Government Intro-duced a Bill to enable the Trustees of the British Museum and of the National Gallery to lead objects vested in the for public exhibition outside Great Britain^    The moment seemed favourable to obtain authority for the lending of pictures from the national collections for display in our diplomatic buildings abroad, and a Government amendment wi 3 moved to this effect *The Bill was taken first in the Lords9 where it was vigorously opposed by certain Trustees of the British Must 1221 and of the Hational Gallery, notably Lord Hanworth and L01 d Lee, who carried amendments limiting loans to objects representative of British arts or crafts produced subsequ&apos;: at-ly to the year leOOe   The amendment regarding the loan of pictures to diplomatic buildings was also negatived,,   In the Commons the Lords * amendments were rejected^ and the original amendment relating to the loan of pictures to diplomatic buildings was reiatrodueed*   When the Bill returned to the Lords opposition continued, and the Gommoj: ac amendments were rejected once more, with the exception of that relating to the loan of pictures to diplomatic buildings which was somewhat reluctantly agreed too   In view of the deadlock between the two Houses the Government decided toEGRETCABINETlp.  18S (34)
drop the Bill.The question of reintroduGiug the  (Overseas Loans) Eili, If necessary on a modified scale so as to pen itthe lending of pictures only for exhibition overseas,, has recently been reopened by a deputation from the Empire Art Loans Collection Society who saw the Prime Minister and made representations to this effecto   The High Commissioners for Australia and Hew Zealand formed part of this deputation and urged the reintroduotion of the original BilloThe Royal Conaission en Museumsa when advocating the laai of pictures overseas^ pointed out that the nation which has recently welcomed so many great international exhibitions in it.-capital citys and fails to reciprocate^ cannot escape a charge i t churlishness a   It also stressed the importance of making Britisl art better Imown abroado   These reasons still hold good? hut it would indeed he difficult to justify the lending of pictures from the National Galleries to the Dominions aloneo   If they are lent&apos;;5 then they should be available for all countries where there are the necessary safeguardso   I know that the French authorities are mo3t anxious to organize a representative exhibition of British art in Pariss and unless the national collections can contribute it would he impossible to secure adequate representation of such painters as Turner and Constahle0The Trustees of the National and Tate Galleries and of the British Museum have again been consulted as to the desirability of reintroducing the Overseas Loans B11I9   The Boards of the National and the Tate Galleries agreed unanimously to lending works by British artists only for public exhibition abroad, hut the authorities of the British Museum have not been able to modify their general opposition to the measureo   In the
circumstaxices it would appear awsiraoxe to confine the proposed power to lend to the National and Tate Galleries, and to exclude the British Museum from the measure.     In this way it should be possible to carry the Bill without the opposition previously experienced.      The opportunity might as well be taken to insert a clause In the Bill authorising the loan of British pictures for display In our diplomatic buildings abroad.     Lord Mersey recently proposed to introduce, but has deferred, a Bill for this purpose and the omission of the provision would require defence.The Boards of the two Galleries have been sounded on this point and have expressed their views that loans should be restricted to diplomatic residences having the status of Embassies.     They also add that if pictures acquired by them, or bequeathed to them, for public exhibition are lent for purposes of furnishing to Embassies abroad, it would have the effect of more or less permanently withdrawing them from public access, and they also state that they have very few pictures, other than some of those already on loan in Government Offices in this country, that would be at all suitable for furnishing our Embassies.     I am personally convinced that the very real needs of our Embassies, particularly our Rome Embassy, can only be met by the occasional purchase, as opportunity offers, of some decorative but not high-priced pictures, suited to the needs of particular rooms, and it has been agreed with the Treasury that a small annual provision shall be made for this purpose. Accordingly, while I think the powers to loan to Embassies from the national collections should be obtained, I doubt whether much will be gained In practice.Pull discretionary power would be given to the Trustees of the two Galleries concerned to frame such regulations as they consider desirable, as regards the pictures to be lent, the periods of the loan and the various safeguards considered
necessaryo   It Is assumed that the cost or transport and of the appropriate safeguards would be borne by the borrower, which, in the case of loans to diplomatic buildings, would entail a charge en the Vote for Public Buildings Overseas oThe Boards of the National Portrait Gallery and of the National Gallery of Scotland, and the Board of Education as authority over the Victoria and Albert Museums already possess such general powers to lend overseas as it is now proposed to confer on the National and Tate Galleries0Clearly there is no time to carry the Bill in either Bouse of Parliament before the summer recess, but I should like to have the authority of the Cabinet to rein traduce the Bill, with the modifications proposed above, on the chance of getting, it through in the autumn sessionoThe actual draft of the Bill should be examined by and reported on by the Home Affairs Committee before introductionoUoalo Office of Works &amp;c0WoOotio10th *July, 1934 o
