(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT )..copy no. ,:  :--SECRET.CP.   213.   (34).CABINET. INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation by the Government ox  India,  dated 14th September, 1934.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential -appreciation of the Political Situation in India dated 14th September 1934,  issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.During the last month there has been little change in political situation.The provinces still record disputes between various groups ox Congressmen over elections to provincial and district Congress committees,  and during the last xewdays^th split between the Congress Parliamentary Board and the Nationalist Party of Malaviya and -aney appears to have grown wider.    At inaugural meeting of the latter body held in Calcutta in the middle ox August,  the attempts made by Hindu Mahasabha to secure alliance with the new party were rejected and,  as an indication that the party would consist ox tried Congressmen and would support Congress programme on all points, except in regard to communal award,  the party was designated the Congress Nationalist Party.    The reports, however,  of a meeting recently hold at V/ardha show that no compromise has been reached between Congress Parliamentary Board and the new party.    Details of points in dispute were given in paragraph 2 of appreciation for July.    It does not at first sight appear seriousj    both parties condemn the White Paper; Malaviya&apos;s party condemns also the communal award, while Gandhi&apos;s supporters regard a direct attach on communal award as anti.-national and prefer that the award should automatically lapse with the rejection of white Paper.It goes to show some lack of political skill in Congress circles if their differences cannot be reconciled, but whether or not they are reconciled before the election, it is probable tho two parties will unite in an attack on constitutional proposals, or on so called &quot;repressive&quot;&apos;&apos; legislation of tho Government, when the now Assembly moots. The Working Committee has also reiterated the point that &quot;Purna Swaraj&quot; means complete control over the Army,
2.external affairs and economic financial and fiscal policy, and that free India must have freedom to make its choice between voluntary partnership with the British Empire and complete separation.   Congress must strain every nerve to end the present unnatural and humiliating connection.Apart, however, from the question of communal award there are other differences between the various groups which go to form Congress.    Jawahar Lai Nehru, who was released from jail for a few days owing to his wife&apos;s illness, appears to resent the attitude adopted by Gandhi and his followers which he regards as defeatist abandonment of their cherished idealsj    in particular he regrets the ignorance shown by the Working Committee of the elements of socialism and their lack of sympathy with thepvement owing to their ever-mastering desire to reassure certain vested interests.Though Nehru was not at liberty to spread his views,  there are probably many, especially among the younger men, who share them and who would welcome a more militant and revolutionary policy.In contrast to the dispute among the predominantly Hindu Congress camp,  there are signs of growing unity among Muslims.    During the last winter an attempt to create a. fusion between the two main Muslim political organisations, the Muslim Conference and the Muslim League,  came to nothing, though sponsored by the Aga Khan.       Now they have united to form a Joint Election Board and have issued a programme recommending,  inter alia,, that although the communal award and White Paper are not entirely satisfactory, they should be accepted in default of something better.    ah interesting feature of the election
will be the extent to which candidates supported by this Board succeed in defeating Nationalist Muslims supported by Congress organisation.The last session of the Legislative Assembly has now ended and much useful and practical legislation has been passed, such as the Indian Factory Act, providing for a 54 hour week, the Steel Protection Act and the Criminal Law Amendment Acts,  to which reference was made last month.      The Bill which gave rise to greatest controversy was the Indian Army Bill which was intended to place Indian officers recruited under new scheme of Indianisation in the same position as officers of the Dominions&apos; armies.Exception was taken to the fact that the Bill did not empower Indian officers to command British troops and the opposition, regardless of the fact that any such provision would have been an infringement of the Royal prerogative, attacked the Bill on the ground that it was a slight on Indian nationalism.       The Bill was ultimately only passed with a small majority in Lower House.     No doubt the views of many members were influenced by the fact that an election was at hand.The Temple Entry Disabilities Removal Bill was also discussed at the close of session and, after a short debate, was withdrawn by the Mover, who created some sensation by indulging in a violent attack on Congress for having abandoned Karijans, and for not having pushed forward the Bill. This goes to show that the Bill was originally introduced not so much as a bona fide measure of social reform to help, depressed classes, as a politioal manoeuvre, designed   to    cause    embarrassment    to    the   Government
Government.    Government made clear that they opposed the Bill in view of strong opposition which it had engendered in the country,  and in consideration of opinion expressed by several Local Governments, that legislation would lead to serious breach ox public peace.    Their attitude was generally well received by the orthodox community, though many,-&apos; no doubt, would have preferred them to take the view that a Bill ox this kind was an interference with religion,  and thus a direct infringement of Royal Proclamation of 1857.
