FIDENTIAL. A, C.500.;BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.STATE OF TRADE - JUNE 1934.Summary of Reports,  submitted by members of the. Board of Trade, Ad visor y Council, ^supplemented in seme cases with statistical information from other sources)&apos;.OVERSEAS TRADE.    Imports in June were  61.2 m., and total exports 536.4 m. compared with 553.8 m. and 533.7 m. in June, 1933.     Of the increase of 57.4 m. in imports, 52.1 m, were in food, drink and tobacco, nearly 53.0 m. in raw materials and  202 m. in manufactured goods.     In the case of the raw material group, imports of wood and timber increased by 52.0 m., and of rubber by 50.8 nu     Imports of raw cotton and cotton waste, however, declined by  0.7 m. In the case of exports, almost all the groups of manufactured articles showed an increase,  the main exception being non-ferrous metals and manufactures thereof.     Exports of imported merchandise were 54.3 m, as against 55.2 m. in June, 1933.     The excess of imports over exports in June was 524.7 m. as against 520.0 m. in June, 1933.     For the first six months of the year the excess was  143.5 m. as against 5119.8 m. in the corresponding period of 1933oBHPLOYMENT.     The improvement in employment which has been recorded in recent months continued during June in most of the principal industries, but the general level of recorded unemployment was slightly higher, mainly owing to a seasonal decline in the coal-mining industry.-
The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges in Great Britain at 25th June was 2,092,586,  an increase of 2,205 as compared with 14th May. The number wholly unemployed, including casuals, decreased &quot;by 104,087, &quot;but the number temporarily stopped increased &quot;by 106,292.The changes &quot;between 25th June and 14th May in thedifferent Divisions were: -London - 10,862South Eastern - 13,209South Western - 13,168Midlands * 25,356North Eastern * 30,551North Western -   5,4 95Scotland - 20,243Wales *   9,275Jhe estimated number of insured persons in employment at 25th June was 10,163,000.     This was 24,000 less than at 14th May, 1934, hut 419,000 more than at 26th June, 1933.The industries showing the most marked improvement &quot;between 14 th May and 25th June were engineering, shipbuilding and ship-repairing,  iron and steel, tinplate and electric apparatus manufacture, the &quot;brick, tile and glass industries, printing and bookbinding, certain food manufacturing industries,  the transport and distributive trades, and hotel and hoarding house service.There was a sharp decline, however, in the coalmining industry, reflected in a marked increase between 14th May and 25th June in the number of workpeople temporarily suspended from their employment;    and there were also reductions in employment in nost of the textile industries, the clothing trades, including boot and shoe manufacture, and the motor vehicle and pottery industries.ROAD AND RAIL TRAFFIC.    Railways t    For the 4 weeks ended 1st July,  1934,  traffic receipts were  437,000 (3.94, ) more than in the corresponding period of 1933. This year, moreover, the period did not, as in 1933, include
the Whitsuntide holidays.     For the 26 weeks ended 1st july the increase was  3.5 million (5.22*/*)*     The percentagechanges in the various classes of traffic were:-4 weeks ended        26 weeks ended 1st July. 1st July.Passenger Train Traffic - 1.62                    * 0.79 Me r chandIs e, mi neralsand live stock .......... +11.26                     t- 9,80Coal,  coke and patentFor the 4 weeks ended 21st April freight tonnage was 12.7*6 more than a year ago.     The largest increase was in minerals and merchandise (18.9$).     Live stock showed a decrease of 4.1$i,    For the calendar month of April the following percentage increases over quantities carried in April 1933 are recorded:-    Iron and Steel 41.9, iron ore 61,5, pig iron 49cl, &quot;bricks 14.3, timber 19.0, limestone for blast furnaces 40.5, gravel and sand 27.7o     There was a decline of 7.3-i in loadings of road-making materials.Motorsi     The number of motor vehicles, other than motor cycles, newly registered in May was 29,285,  or 17.9J* more than in May 1933.     The increase comprised 2,978 private cars and 1,471 goods and other vehicles.     Registrations of motor cycles increased &quot;by 1,136 (24.5^)*FINANCE,    (l) London:-   In the money market comfortable conditions prevailed until towards the end of the month when preparations for the end of the half year led to considerable pressure for money.     Bill rates underwent little change, with a fairly consistent buying rate of 15/l6ths for three months&apos; bills throughout the month.     The Treasury hill tender rate was a little easier but was also fairly consistent at an average of a little over 17/- per cent, for the month. considerable supplies of gold were again dealt with in the bullion market, much of the metal apparently still being taken on U.U.A. accounts
The principal exchanges on the whole remained fairly stable, though sterling showed a somewhat weak tendency. The narrow margin of discount on the forward French Exchange may be evidenoe that speculative dealings have ceased. Discount rates for German &quot;standstill&quot; bills have been raised, but recent references in the Press to defaults on German bills would appear to refer to bills drawn in sterling but not accepted by an English bank, nor even necessarily bearing an English name, and few discount houses deal in this tyPe Qf bill.(2) France;-   The Fiscal Reform Law was not passed until the Government put it to a vote of confidence.   It is officially estimated that the loss in revenue through the abolition or simplification of taxes will be Frs. 2,000 m. though this will be offset by a yield of Frs. 600 m. from oertain other taxes and Fr. 1,300 m. from the closing of loopholes for evasion.     During the debate there was some criticism of the Government on the ground that their financial and economic policies were opposed, and it was argued that either the frano must go by the board or prioe levels be drastically reduced.   French opinion seems equally opposed to currency devaluation and deflation by wage cuts, but it is not perhaps so fixed as before on the question of devaluation.The Treasury is about to issue a Frs. 3,000 mn. 4% Loan at 95, repayable In 50 years at 150.   Part of the proceeds will be devoted to meeting bonds maturing in October, next.     It has also repaid about two-thirds of the bonds Issued in Amsterdam last March.     The &quot;Marquet&quot; Public Works scheme has been voted by Parliament;    it provides for the electrification and Improvement of the railways in the hope of making them self-supporting as they have been a heavy drag on the Exobe quer in the last few years.
(3) Germany:-.   The settlement of the question of the servioe of bondo of the Daweo and Young Loans in the hands of British holders was welcomed, as it obviated measures which would have been detrimental to the trade of both countries  The Importance to Germany of maintaining and expanding her export trade is ohown by the estimate that in the first quarter of 1934 exports accounted for 14$ of total German industrial production as against 22$ for the vriaole of 1933. The present considerable stocks of raw materials, aooumulated for some time past, will be running low later in the year, and it is to be hoped that the export surplus will have risen to a figure which will enable Germany to replenish them.     otherwise a further restriction of imports might threaten the whole programme of economic recovery.(4) U.S .A.   -   Congress has adjourned   until January next.     The Housing Bill, passed by Congress on Its last day, seeks to unfreeze the mortgage situation in the construction industry, whioh is the largest in the United States and gives employment to five million people.     It is not simply a further plan to finance new or refund old mortgages, but is an attempt to attract private capitaJl Into the mortgage market by the State insurance of desirable mortgages and of the oapital of shareholders in approved building or loan aooieties.     Owing, however, to the high wages and the high prioes of materials in the building industry It is not certain that the bill will bring about a substantial Improvement.     The Administration has decided to abandon its polioy of price-fixing but it Is not clear how it can otherwise pursue the policy, to whioh it still adheres, of preventing destructive prioe-outting.     The Treasury returns for the finanoial year ended 30th June reveal a net deficit
of  3,629 m. which, although larger by $835 m* than In any previous peace-time year, is only about half the estimated deficit.     The Administration intend to spend in the current financial year up to the full amounts provided for in the last Budget.     The public debt, at $27,043 m. is the highest ever reached, yet money rates have not hardened. In fact, the tendenoy Is rather the other way*OPAL.   The average weekly output of ooal during the 13 weeks ended 23rd June was 4,140,000 tons oompared with 3,788,000 tons a year ago, being an Inorease of 9$.     Tne average number of persons employed during this period was 781,400 as against 778,000 a year before.   Exports in June at  2,826,000 were  360,000 higher than in the corresponding month of 1933.   For the first six months of 1934 the total exports of ooal were  230,000 higher than in the corresponding period of 1933.   As oompared with last year there were inoreases in our exports in June to Scandinavian oountries, Germany, Holland, Algeria and Canada.   On the other hand exports were somewhat smaller to the Irish Free State, France,. Italy and Argentina.     Home consumption in May was estimated at 3?5 higher than a year ago.IRON AND STEEL.     There has been a seasonal decline in business but the tone remains firm and it is anticipated that buying will be resumed on a good scale after the holiday period.       Domestic demand continues to predominate but there have been reoently some indications of a revival in overseas business which i3 abnormally depressed.   There has been some decline in new business, in pig iron, but it is reported that ourrent production is passing Into consumption and stocks are not being increased..
Light castings were in good demand until the seasonal lull came;   enquiries from overseas also lnoreased but foreign competition is Intense.     As regards semi-finished oteel the larger consumers are well covered at present, but there are sufficient orders in hand to keep works well ocoupled until the Autumn.     Several fair-sized orders have however been placed with Continental makers and sales of Continental material are substantially higher than a year ago.   In finished steel products the lighter branches are more aotive than the heavy sections.   Overseas business has Improved somewhat, largely owing to better Empire demand.In Sootland the volume of new business has shown some falling off and a decline in the rate of operations In the later months of the year may be anticipated.     There is an urgent need of shipbuilding orders.   Export trade is quiet, but important orders have been received for plates and rails from China.On the Horth-Eaat Coast steel output In June v/as slightly greater than in May and the outlook is also considered to be encouraging.     Business in structural steel provides a steady flow of orders and the demand for heavy joists shows marked improvement.     Export trade is unsatisfactory, but orders have been booked for railway material for China and steel plates for Russia.In the Sheffield dig district some manufacturers are said to be glad to avail themselves of the   seasonal lull in order to catch up with arrears.   Billets, sheets and strip are in very active demand for this period of the year and makers of special steels are also busy.
In South Wales no substantial change is reported. Purchases of serai-finished material have slackened but the demand for heavy finished steel products is being maintained.   The position in galvanised sheets is highly unsatisfactory as home trade is less active and export business is exceptionally poor.   The tin plate market is quiet,ENGINEERING. The improvement has been well maintained. Unemployment amongst members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union has diminished steadily from 29,309 persons in December 1933, to 20,590 persons in June, 1934, and the general outlook is good.   All districts have shared in the general Improvement in employment save Dundee and Lancashire, where conditions remain bad.   The heavy section still remains the least responsive to the more favourable conditions; competition is severe, but the home demand is firm and enquiries for export have been more numerous.   Exports to Russia, particularly of machine tools,are steadily expanding and there is a definite upward trend in the trade in textile machinery with Poland, Argentina and South -Africa,    Some shipbuilding centres are fairly active, but much more work Is required and the Immediate prospect, in spite of orders for two cruisers which have affected the Clydebank particularly, remains dull. In the locomotive engineering   section L.M.S. and Indian Railway orders have improved the outlook.    The improvement In electrical engineering Is likely to be maintained.   A  4 million contract has been placed in Manchester for the electrification of the Warsaw railway system.MOTOR TR;J)E.   Representations have been made with a view to obtaining a review of the tariff position in Australia and New Zealand under the Ottawa Agreements and the outcome is being awaited with Interest.    The industry is anxious
also to obtain a preference to tho-South Jlfrlcan^raarket-and   a preference for commercial motors and an Increase in the preference for private cars In India.    Among foreign markets the non-payment of accrued Customs rebate on United Kingdom cars in Spain continues to cause difficulty.MACHINE TOOLS..    The posit-ion In the home trade continues to Improve and there is markod activity.   Many makers are running night shifts and finding difficulty In obtaining an adequate supply of skilled labour.   Exports of machine tools for the month of June amounted to  175,000 as oompared with  118,000 in May,  and  134,000 in April. Exports to Russia showed a considerable improvement, being  76,000 in June as against  27,000 in May and  41,000 in April.    Trade with Prance continues to be unsatisfactory.Imports of machine tools during June amounted to  103,000 as compared with  147,000 in May.    In spite of the developments which have taken place in the manufacture of machine tools In this country, there is still a considerable demand for imported machinery mainly of a specialised character.LIGHTER METaL INDUSTRIES. The demand for general cutlery showed a small decline in June though manufacturers., of scissors,  safety razor blados and tool knives were well employed.    Trade In spoons and forks was quiet and business in sterling silver and E.P.N.S. ware fell eff slightly. The Sheffield topi trades are 9xceptionally active,   Homa demand for fishing tackle continues to show marked improvement, but there is a seasonal decline In foreign business.   Foreign imports of enamelled hollow-ware continue to affect the sales
of home products.   Conditions in the light foundry industry are still satisfactory; a seasonal lull is approaching, hut it is probable that the autumn demand will be better than for some years past.    The output in the metallic bedstead trado is being steadily maintained though there are difficulties with firms outside the Association,,    Demand has declined in the lock and allied trades, owing, it is believed, to imports.    Business in architectural metal work has improved slightly, but it is still much below normal.    The attempt to form an Association has fallen through.    The demand for pressings   by the motor trade still continues and the growing manufacture of refrigerators has also increased business. Conditions In the metal window trade are good.    The non-ferrous metal trades are fairly satisfactory and show little change. Imports of copper and brass sheets and tubes from the Continent were maintained and increased competition is being encountered In non-ferrous metals in South African markets,ELECTRICITY. During June 1,049 million units were produced, as compared with 885 million a year before, Tho Increase this year over the first six months of 1933 is 17.47$.    The percentage of productive capacity in use is now over the May figure of 60%,    Orders received for heavy plant in the home market were again lower than in the corresponding month of 1933, but a further Increase in export orders brought the total index figure to 70, a3 against 61 in June 1933. Imports of light apparatus in May amounted to  304,875, which is double those of May 1933k   Exports in May were  588,197 against  586,738 a year before.
COTTON.   Production in June was on a lower level than in May.     The price of cotton rose during the month, more by reason   of the crop prospects in the United States of America than of demand.     The margin between Indian and American widened and the tendency for the former to replace certain types of American is therefore likely to continue.Deliveries of raw cotton averagsd 51,500 bales a week against 52,300 in May.     The fall in production was more marked in the Egyptian spinning section than in the American but the former is ooncerned at recent events in Germany, which is an important market for Its oroducts.     The rise in raw ootton orices has narrowed spinners&apos; margins especially in the coarse section where the prioe agreement has been suspended. Efforts are being made to improve conditions and the General Committee of the Master Spinners&apos; Federation has recommended the formation of a voluntary association to control production through a pool and quota scheme, and the setting up of a committee to deal with surplus capacity.     In the weaving section many firms are complaining that the recent reduction in the excise duty on artificial silk has caused thorn serious loss on stocks of cloth and yarns on which duty had been paid at the old rate.A joint committee of employers and operatives has been set up to agree proposals on wages so as to take advantage of the Cotton Manufacturing Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act,Exports of yarns and piece goods, though lower than in May, were about 1$ and 4% respectively higher than in June 1933. Muoh of the improvement in piece goods was due to better shipments to India, Canada and South Africa.     The newly imposed Colonial quotas have not yet had time to take effect. Trade with the Continent was generally poor, and exports to Turkey, Egypt and Morocco were disappointing.     Exports to Sweden,
however, showed a significant increase, and there was a substantial rise in exports to French West Africa.     central and South America as a whole took 28.0 million sq. yds., as oompared with 22.4 million a year ago, a decline in shipments to Colombia being more than counterbalanced by increased shipments to Cuba and Argentina.CHEMICALS.   Alkali deliveries in June in the home market continued to be good, but exports showed a slight decline.     Home deliveries of chlorine products and heavy acids were satisfactory, although rather less than earlier in the year;   exports of chlorine products remained satisfactory. Sales of most major dyestuffs increased and even alizarine and indigo shared In the improvement.     The market for wood distillation products was steady.     Chareoal continued in good demand, although stocks are rather higher than last month.      In the coal tar products market there was fair activity, especially in creosote oil and refined tar, while the demand for cresylio acid increased steadily.     Solvent naphtha, toluol and xylol, however, were In poor demand. Business In pharmaceutical products was better and a good seasonal trade was reported in cream of tartar, citric and tartarlc acids.SPAP,  OILS AND KINDRED INDUSTRIES.      The demand for soap continued quiet and the market shows little resilience. The reduced consumption of margarine continues with a decline of about 2-jj$ in the four weeks of June as compared with the previous four weeks.     Business in edible oils and fats remains affected by the low prices of imported American lard. There was the normal seasonal decline in the volume of business in raw materials.     The turnover in the latter for the first six months of the year shows an Increase of 10$ over the corresponding months of 1933.
PAPER.    The demand for newsprint, while rather better than in June 1933, was distinctly weaker than in I/Iay. Imports showed an increase of 45;i over the figures for June 1933, owing to a large expansion in supplies from Newfoundland.   The slight improvement in demand for printing papers v/as maintained, but demand was definitely less than a year ago.      Business in fine papers compared favourably with a year before, export trade continuing to show an appreciable increase.    Conditions were fairly well maintained in some sections of the wrapping paper industry but the price of M.G. Sulphite paper was affected by the break up of the foreign suppliers&apos; convention.    British Kraft wrapping paper v/as in poor demand in June, owing to foreign imports which were 70/i above those of June 1933. Business in paper boards v/as definitely better than in June of last year, thanks to the general improvement in other industries and the recent increase of 5/o in the duty on certain kinds of paper.     A decision on the question of the duty on strav/board is anxiously awaited.A review of the t rade generally of the first six months of the year shov/s that there has been a definite improvement over the corresponding period of last year in the demand for newsprint, fine papers and boards.     Printing papers and v/rapping papers, however, were in less demand and imports of Kraft v/rapping paper have increased by 47/j.      Imports of newsprint have increased and exports have declined, but exports of printing and fine papers have steadily improved. Prices throughout the industry remain unsatisfactory, however; the prices of raw materials have advanced but those of paper have been held in check by overseas competition and, in the cases which are less open to foreign competition, by the excess of supply over demand.CO-OPERATIVE TRADE.     The Co-operative viholesale Society^!
sales for the four v/eeks ended 9th June were 14.2?b more than in the corresponding period of last year.     The weighted wholesale prices of seven principal commodities showed a decrease in price of 2.88)6 compared with 12 months ago.    The v/eighted retail prices of Societies are estimated to have increased by 0.34^.SHIPPING. The index number of shipping freights (1913 a 100) for June shows a decline to 73.59, as compared with 76.45 in May, and 77.35 a year ago.Tonnage under construction in Great Britain and Ireland in the quarter ended 30th June was 587,142 gross tons, against 481,440 tons last quarter and 287,502 tons in the June quarter of 1933.     The improvement is due probably to the necessity of replacing special vessels which have become obsolete.     The tonnage laid up at ports in Great Britain and Ireland on 1st April, 1934 was 1,079,000 net tons as against 1,864,000 tons a year before.mam-CANADIAN TRADE. The index of the physical volume   ofbusiness rose from 92.6 in April to 99.6 in May, against 76.4in May 1933.    The index of manufacturing operations revealed aconsiderable further expansion.    The output of food productsincreased,  wheat flour production advanced from 1,064,000 to1,089,000 barrels.    Sugar output, however, declined somewhatfrom its previous high level.    Cattle slaughterings increasodmore than normally for the season.    The index for the paper andlumber group moved up from 94.2 to 103.6. The production of newsprint In June, at 242,539 tons against 216,507 tons in May,reached its highest point since 1929, and exports of boards andplanks in June amounted to 112.7 million feet, against 60.8million in May.   Pig iron output at 38,189 tons increased andthe production of steel ingots, at 71,437 tons, was practicallymaintained.   Wholesale prices, which had fallen.In March and april, were steadier in May.    The prices of crop products, woodand paper, iron and chemicals showed an advance.-14-
AUSTRALIAN TRADE.     From-July 1st, 1933, to the ond of May, 1934, 2,664,981 hales of wool were received Into store. Of these 2,487,663 were disposed of.     Up to the end of June wheat exports for the season amounted to 34,838,232 bushels, and of flour to 311,429 tons.     Putter shipments at 107,043 tons up to the 16th June show an increase over the figure of 99,782 tons for the corresponding period of last year.     Total imports of merchandise in Hay amounted to  6.48 million (Australian currency) against  5.25 million a year ago.SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.     The high level of activity prevailing in Johannesburg and along the Reef Is attributed to the influence of the revival of the gold industry in consequence of the enhanced price of that metal.     The April output of gold was valued at  5.84 million against  5.32 million a year ago.     Elsewhere signs of the depression are still apparent.     Of the large towns Durban has shown least recovery, owing no doubt to the continued depression in shipping, and the low ebb of coal mining in Natal.Agricultural conditions are less satisfactory than earlier in the year.     Locusts have done damage in Natal, Zululand and the Preo ;state.     The German import restrictions have caused a fall in prices, particularly in the case of wool.     Maize prices also have fallen on account of offerings of the new crop.     The following crop estimates are announced:-   Maize, 18.9 million bags against 3.3 million last season.     Kaffir corn, 549,000 bags against 260,000.     Cotton seed, 307 million lbs. against 2.3 million.     Ground nuts, 285,000 bags against 175,000. Tobacco, 13.4 million lbs. against 9.3 million.     Among manufacturing industries engineering,  except at coastal centres, continues at a high level of activity and there is a fair volume of business in clothing and footwear and in the motor assembling trade.     The building boom continues unabated. Imports of merchandise in April amounted to  4.8 million against  3.5 million a year ago, and exports  7.2 million against  6.8 million.Board of Trade. 24 th July, 1934.-15-
