Copy No. 40CP. 184 (34).CABINET.JAPANESE COMPETITION-IMPOSITION OF TEXTILE QUOTAS in ceylon.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN continuation of the paper which I circulated to the Cabinet last week (CP. 172 (34)), I circulate herewith for the information of my colleagues a copy of further telegraphic correspondence with the Governor of Ceylon.P. C.-L.Colonial Office, Downing Street, Jidy 9. 1934.ANNEX.(1)Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Ceylon to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.Dated 4th July, 1934. (Received Colonial Office 7-15 a.m. 4th July, 1934.) Private and Personal.May I ask that you will if possible make no mention of Order in Council, but use only general terms such as &quot; all necessary measures&quot;? This will make it difficult to organise demonstrations of protest and will keep the Council guessing.I will send information asked for in your telegram of the 2nd July as soon as possible, but fear no chance of its being available by Friday.(2)Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the governor of Ceylon.(Sent 6 p.m. 4th July, 1934.)Private and Personal.Colonial Office Vote has been postponed till early next week. I shall do my best to follow line suggested in your telegram 4th July.Ceylon position was considered by the Cabinet this morning. They are anxious to go as far as possible to carry Ceylon Ministers with them. President of the Board of Trade would be prepared, in order to secure their support and to reach a settlement, to agree to 20 per cent preference if accompanied by an alternative minimum specific duty of l\d. per yard on foreign textiles and by removal of existing duty on Empire textiles and to give up the quota.   The rate[10287]
(3)Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Ceylon to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.Dated 5th July, 1934.(Received in the Colonial Office at 8-46 a.m. on 5th July, 1934.)Private and Personal.In reply to your telegram Private and Personal of 2nd July, (a) Japanese imports from 7th May to 30th June total 13,316,000 yards, which is 5,000,000 yards over quota for the whole year, and are still coming in at increasing rates. \b) Expected 15th September, or possibly a week earlier.(4)Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Ceylon to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.Dated 7th July, 1934.(Received in the Colonial Office at 7-40 a.m. on 7th July, 1934.)Immediate, Private and Personal.Your private and personal telegram 4th July. I understand the suggestion to be that foreign textiles should be subject to 20 per cent, ad valorem or l\d. a yard, whichever is higher, and that Empire textiles should be free.My own opinion is that unless the quid pro quo mentioned is definitely promised, there is no possibility of such a proposal being accepted by the Council. Even then I should be doubtful. I do not think that in the circumstances Ministers would introduce legislation.   Do you wish me to consult Ministers ?(5)Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to theGovernor of Ceylon.(Sent 2-30 p.m. 7th July, 1934.)Private and Personal.Many thanks for your telegram. You should not consult Ministers without further instructions. I personally incline to think it would probably be wise, as a matter of tactics, to make the offer, even if it is likely to be refused. It would show that we have gone as far as possible in making concession.   Do you agree ?If Ministers will not introduce and strongly support the revised proposal, and we are compelled to act ourselves, obviously our action should be by an Order in Council authorising you to impose quotas. The fact that Japanese have -already largely exceeded their quota makes time a vital factor.of l\d. is that actually imposed by Union of South Africa. We are considering as a matter of urgency whether it will be possible to undertake in return for this to propose in Finance Bill next year import duty of 10 per cent, on foreign soya beans and to increase duty on foreign plumbago from 10 to 20 per cent. Please let me have as soon as possible your own opinion whether your Ministers would accept such an arrangement, and whether they would introduce and do their best to ensure passage of such a duty; also what the prospects would be of passage through Council without certification in such circumstances.
^Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Ceylon to the Secretory of Statefor the Colonies.Dated 8th July, 1934.(Received Colonial Office 8 a.m.&apos;8th July, 1934.)Private and Personal.Your private and personal telegram, of the 7th July. I concur as to making the oiler. It is strongly urged by the Attorney-General that the Financial Secretary should introduce the legislation under Article No. 22, if the Ministers are unwilling to do so, and he is of the opinion that two weeks would suffice for passing it, and that there is not such prospect of successful obstruction as to make it desirable to proceed by Order-of His Majesty-in-Council, so as to preclude the Council from voting on the measure.My inclination is to agree, but when the Board of Ministers&apos; meeting on the 9th July has reported, I shall be in a better position to advise.In my judgment, alternative scheme is better tha.n the quota, whichever method is actually adopted.(7)Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to theGovernor of Ceylon.(Sent 9th July, 1934.)Immediate.   No.    .   Secret. My telegram No. 97*Please communicate substance of the following to Ministers : I have given further consideration, in consultation with the President of Board of Trade, to alternatives to textile quotas suggested by Ministers. His Majesty&apos;s Government are most anxious to secure co-operation of Ministers in measures necessary to protect British trade in piece-goods against Japanese competition, and, in view of the predilection expressed by Ministers for procedure by way of preference instead of quotas, they would be prepared in all the circumstances to accept a change in the Ceylon tariff by which a duty of 20 per cent, ad valorem, or l\d. per yard on cotton piece-goods and 3d. per yard on rayon piece-goods, whichever is the higher, would be imposed on foreign textiles, and Empire goods would be admitted free. The rates of duty proposed are those imposed on foreign piece-goods by the Union of South Africa under the Ottawa Agreement.In recognition of such an extension of the principle of preference in Ceylon, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to give further tariff assistance to Ceylon products and would accordingly undertake, if the suggested preference were voted by the State Council, to propose to Parliament in next year&apos;s Finance Act a duty of 10 per cent, on foreign soya beans and an increase from 10 per cent, to 20 per cent, in the duty on foreign plumbago.It is important that any action in Ceylon should be taken immediately, and I should be glad to know at once whether Ministers are prepared to move the necessary Resolution in the State Council and to give these proposals active support.   The proposals should not be made public without consultation with me.* Vide (-2) in Annex to CP. 172 (34).
oParaphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to theGovernor of Ceylon.(Sent 9th July, 1934.)Immediate. Private and Personal.Your telegram of 8th July, private and personal. Board of Trade suggested offer of l^d. was as compromise which would be acceptable in return for full Ministerial support. It is not satisfactory or comparable with quota legislation in other parts of Colonial Empire. If overriding powers are exercised, we must use them to get effective protection. Quota is infinitely preferable for this purpose to tariff. It ensures distribution of market and allows entry at normal rate of duty of permitted amounts. If powers used, choice must be between quota and duty of civilian.2. Attorney-GeneraFs argument is not followed here. Order of His Majesty in Council would vest power in you to take immediate action, and would be debatable only on a resolution which would involve only one debate and would not affect or delay action. Legislation introduced and certified would involve all risks and delays set out in my telegram of 30th June. Time is very important, and I am seriously alarmed at excess of imports over quota.3. Cabinet have approved formal proposals being made to Ministers as in my telegram of 4th July, and a separate official telegram is being sent conveying message to them. Please ask them to reply by morning of 12th July, as I shall have to make announcement during debate on Colonial Office Vote on that date.
