THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.) E C R E T..P. 204 (34) . COPY NO. *4- ^CABINET.REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON COMMERCIAL AIR TRANSPORT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1. There are one or two points in connection with thereport of the Committee on Commercial Air Transport (CP.190(34) ) on which I should like to make brief comment.2. The first is the question of speed.    As stated in thereport, the new aircraft with which the services will be operated are to be designed to have a cruising speed of 130 m.p.h.This is an advance of about 25 m.p.h.  on the cruising speed of the air liners at present employed on   our    European services, but there are many who will consider thin speed unduly slow, for, technically speaking, materially higher speeds are possible; and the Air Ministry have only recommended 130 m.p.h. with reluctance as a reasonable compromise between conflicting technical and economic considerations.It is estimated that a cruising speed of 150 m.p.h. v/ould entail an additional cost of  250,000 per annum, and a speed of 175 m.p.h. a similar addition of approximately  600,000 per annum.3. I am somewhat exercised on the whole question of the speed of British air services,  including those between this country and the Continent.    Unfortunately our foreign competitors are apparently prepared to disregard the economic factor in the pursuit of speed, ignoring the fact that in other forms of transport (e.g. steamship)    greater speeds are equally possible technically,  and have not been introduced merely because the cost of their introduction is considered wholly disproportionate-tionate to the commercial value of the degree of acceleration
2.which would he achieved.    So far Imperial Airways are holding their own in the light of the greater comfort,  safety and reliability of their aircraft,  despite their relative slowness. They are in fact to-day still obtaining the lion&apos;s share of the passenger traffic to the Continent, to the unconcealed annoyance of their French and other competitors.    But the situation is not free from difficulty, and I have felt it only right that my colleagues should be aware of it. 4. A direct result of the jealousy which has beenaroused by Imperial Airw^s &apos; success to date in retaining the bulk of the Continental traffic, despite the introduction by their rivals of faster and faster aircraft, has been the obstructive attitude taken up by the French authorities when we recently made application,  on behalf of Imperial Airways, for the Company to operate our Empire services across France to Marseilles en route to Italy,  instead of the section from Paris to Brindisi being operated by train as at present.    The French have stated that they will only give short-term facilities and even these facilities they have hedged round with impossible conditions such as a prohibition on Imperial Airways picking up in France passengers or freight for foreign destinations on the Indian route, which is also served by a French air line.    They have further stated that the same condition will be insisted on in respect of passengers and freight for African destinations,  so soon as a French trans-African air line to Madagascar has been organised.    I need hardly point out that parallel restrictions are unknown in steamship operation (e.g. they would prevent the P. &amp; 0. picking up passengers at Marseilles);    and that,  if all countries were to follow the French example,  international air transport would become virtually impossible.    Moreover, the French relate these conditions directly to the conclusion of a &quot;full commercial agreement&quot; between Imperial Airways and
Air France, the French air combine, whose ideas embrace, inter alia, pooling on a 50/50 basis of all receipts in respect of the Croydon-Paris services.    In fact,  on a basis of current traffic, a proportion of 70/30 would be more closely in accord with the facts,  and,  if a 50/50 basis were accepted, French air services would in effect be receiving a subsidy from the British taxpayer.    The French tactics in this respect seem to me to verge on &quot;blackmail&quot; u.nd their conditions are wholly unacceptable.    Their attitude is the more indefensible, inasmuch as in the past they have always adopted a liberal attitude towards the principle of freedom of operation for international air transport, whilst the Italians on the other hand have tended to be obstructive.    Italy, however, has recently signed (though not yet ratified) an agreement with us giving us full facilities for a ten-year period, and I feel that every effort must be made to secure a similar agreement from France.5. France is, moreover,  already enjoying greatbenefits from the British Empire.    Her service to the East is contingent on facilities for its operation across India, and her projected trans-African service will equally be dependent on facilities to operate across British territory. After interdepartmental discussion between the Foreign Office, the Board of Trade and the Air Ministry, I have decided to send the Director of Civil Aviation over to Paris early next month to co-operate with our Embassy in negotiations on the spot with the French Foreign Office and Air Ministry. I hope the outcome of these negotiations will be successful; but if the French should continue to be obstructive, it may be necessary to threaten the withdrawal of facilities for the operation of their Eastern service across India and of
Air Ministry,  3rd July,  1934.the corresponding facilities which we have promised them for their new trans-African service.    This would, incidentally, entail denouncing the so-called &quot;Concordat&quot; of 1929 which was negotiated between the late Lord Thomson and M. Laurent Eynac, the French Air Minister of the day.    On the whole I am satisfied that in this matter of freedom for our respective air companies to operate over French and British territory, we hold slightly the better cards.    If the worst came to the worst we would get to Italy by other routes across Europe, though certain sections might have to be operated by rail.    But, by the refusal of permission to operate over British territory, we could completely block the existing French service to the Far East, as well as their projected trans-African service.    I am hopeful that the knowledge that we hold these strong cards will bring the French, who are realists, to a more accommodating frame of mind, &quot;but hove felt that the Cabinet should be aware of the somewhat delicate and difficult situation with which we are confronted. 6. This situation has further a direct bearing on one aspect of the present scheme.    From some points of view I should have liked - and I think it probable that the Postmaster General is of the same opinion - to make a public announce-ment, so soon as our plans have been communicated to the Dominions, India and the Colonies.   But I am apprehensive that, if we do so,  and the world becomes aware that we are working on a scheme of such magnitude and importance, French jealousy may be still further aroused, and their attitude harden. I should welcome my colleagues 1 advice on the best tactics to be pursued in the circumstances.
